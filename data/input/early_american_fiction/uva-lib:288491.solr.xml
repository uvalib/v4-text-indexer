      <field name="fulltext">VOL. II. 1 CHAPTER I. I, walking in the place where men's law-suits Are heard and pleaded, not so much as dreaming Of any such encounter; steps me forth Their valiant foreman, with the words, `I 'rest you.' I made no more ado, but laid these paws Close on his shoulders, tumbling him to earth.” George Chapman. The hour was late when the strong-minded maiden, Rachel Morrison, reached her apartments. The family, guests and all, had retired to their several chambers for the night; and in the silent review which she made of the scene she had just witnessed, a most annoying conviction rose in her mind of the probable danger awaiting the young traveller, Vernon, who, she knew, had appointed to resume his journey on the morrow. She recollected the promise of one of the robbers (Saxon) to join him on the road; and this promise she naturally construed into a resolution to assail him. To warn him of his danger was her first impulse, but how was this to be done? It was impossible that she should seek him then; it was scarcely proper, indeed, that she should seek him at any time, and to communicate her warning to Walter Rawlins—the most easy and natural mode—was to prompt his inquiries into other particulars of her knowledge, which she was not yet prepared to unfold. She dreaded the prying mind of her lover, and doubted her own strength to refuse him that knowledge which was effectually to blast and destroy the son of her protector. The conflict in her mind kept her wakeful, and at the dawn of day she was dressed, and anxiously on the watch for that stir in the household which might denote the preparations of the traveller. To her great joy she heard footsteps in the adjoining passage, which she knew to be those of Rawlins. She went forth and joined him. “Walter,” she said, “your friend Mr. Vernon must be on his guard while he rides. There is danger awaiting him—let him see to his arms, and be heedful of the company he meets.” “Ha! Rachel,—but is this all,—know you nothing more?” “Nothing that is of any service to him, and nothing more of his danger. The robbers are near us; they will be on the lookout for him. Counsel him to be well prepared; perhaps you may counsel him to defer his departure.” “I have tried that already, but he is bent on a push to-day. He's very restless to get off, though his thigh's mighty stiff and sore. But tell me, Rachel, how do you know all this?” “Another time, not now—Gideon is stirring. Beware of him.” “Ha! Gideon—say, Rachel, what of Gideon?” The person named, at this moment appeared in the passage-way, and the maiden was gone from sight in the next. The woodman instantly returned to the chamber of Vernon, and apprised him of what he had heard. The latter listened to him without emotion. He looked to his pistols, felt the charge, renewed the priming, and this done, continued his preparations for departure as coolly as before. An early breakfast had been prepared, after which, and the unusually long grace which preceded it, Vernon bade adieu to his rigid, but hospitable host, and joined by Rawlins, rode forth upon his way. The latter escorted him to the river, and on their way to this point, Vernon suggested to him all those plans and precautions, by which the woodman was to conduct the contemplated operations against the robbers. The reasons for the exclusion of the old Methodist and his son were necessarily increased by the significant warning of Rachel Morrison; and, counselled as well as he might be under the existing circumstances, Rawlins returned to Zion's Hill, leaving our hero to pursue his farther journey alone. The narrow, but deep and rapid stream was soon crossed, and now let us also leave him, for a brief space, while he struggles through the rank ooze, and interminable ponds and sluices that skirt, at frequent intervals, and for continued miles on either bank, the dead level borders and drowned lands of the Loosa-Chitta. The sun was slowly ascending through the branches of the towering cottonwood and pine-trees, that seemed to throw themselves forward as barriers in opposition to his progress, along the eastern elevations, when a small party of men, three in number, might have been seen in close consultation beneath their concealing umbrage. One of these was no other than our old acquaintance, Saxon. Their horses were in hand, as if made ready for a journey; and that air of quickness, keenness, and anxiety which mingled in their manner, and contrasted strongly with the low, suppressed tones of their voices, plainly denoted some new expedition. The robbers were evidently preparing for business. “Go you forward,” said Saxon to his two companions as he leapt to the saddle, “and let Nawls get the papers in readiness. Meanwhile, I will take the road from the Benton turn-out, as soon as I am sure that our man has passed it. I know his course now, and can readily overtake him. Remember you are to act as law officers, and you must do your duty with becoming gravity. None of your swaggering and swearing, Binks; and do you, Davis, keep a dry throat. Be sure you cast no discredit on the venerable authority you are supposed to represent. It is an honour no less imposing than new, that you should be made officers of the law you have so often offended.” “Not the less worthy officers for all that,” said one of the fellows. `Set a thief to catch a thief,' is a maxim which will always give a thief employment.” “Ay, but you are to catch an honest man as usual, rascals; so that you are only pursuing an old trade. But ride on; you have no time to waste. In another hour our man will be within reach, and you shall meet us ere we get to Lucchesa. Nawls is better at running a horse than filling out a warrant, and you will need to spur him to the task. Let him waste no minutes that you can save—you, Binks, can fill up the blank and the Judge can sign it. That will shorten the business to his hand, and by all calculations, you should be able to tap your prisoner on his shoulder ere we gain sight of the village. Away.” “It is done,” said Binks, putting spurs to his horse and followed closely by his companion. Saxon, meanwhile, crossing the main road, sank into the 1* opposite forests, and put himself in watch for the coming of his prey. He was not long in waiting. His calculations, the result of long experience of horse's speed and the road, were nearly correct. Before the hour was ended, the trampling of a steed was heard, and Vernon went by. Suffering some moments to elapse, the better to deceive the traveller as to his late proximity, Saxon at length followed and joined him a few hundred yards above. With the first sound of approaching footsteps, Vernon prepared himself for an enemy, but the sight of the stranger somewhat disarmed his apprehensions. Saxon was seemingly without arms of any kind, and there was that in the frank and manly expression of his face, in the free, hearty salutation which he used, and the quiet and simple manner of his address, that Vernon, as a mere physiognomist, had he annexed any importance to this idle study, would have been disposed rather to confide in the new-comer, than to regard him with distrust. He answered the salutation of the stranger with equal frankness, and it was agreed, as they both aimed for Lucchesa, that they should ride on their way together. This is not a matter of difficult arrangement in a country of such lonesome distances and long miles as ours; and where the parties are young, and where they have already had any experience in travelling, there is a very general flexibility of temper, which prompts them to great social compliances when upon the road. But, with the present parties a mutual policy would alone have brought them together; and each aiming at concealment, the frank game was the only one to be played by those who had any occult objects in reserve. Something, too, in the really excellent capacities and good education of the two, may have contributed to bring them more readily together; and each perceiving in the other a nearer approximation to those standards of taste which were most agreeable to himself, and which were something above those presented by the ordinary intellects of forest life, the dialogue grew lively after a brief space of time, and soon became unflagging. “A few years more, sir,” said Saxon, in reply to a remark of Vernon, touching the sparse settlements along the Yazoo; “a few years more, and this country must become exceedingly populous. Its resources must be found out, as they are so greatly desirable to the poor settler every where. The wildness of the region will keep back the cold, the slow, the timid, and the wealthy. They will shrink from a too close neighbourhood with the Indians, and, perhaps, be equally apprehensive of that wild class, the squatters, who, rude, rash, violent and reckless as they are, are yet the necessary men in all new countries. These will continue to be wild, until they have made some valuable acquisitions. It is the possession of something to lose, that makes your social and best citizen, and the robber himself, when his accumulations become valuable, will, I doubt not, settle down into the sober citizen, and grow grave and great among the first moralists of the land.” “If a more sudden elevation does not anticipate such slow results,” said Vernon with a smile; “but,” he continued, “I have no faith in half the monstrous robber-tales which are told of every new country. When you reach the scene of the story, the terrible and frequently bloody event is placed in a region yet farther off. The border is always beyond you; the country of the monsters—the anthropophagi— `Gorgons, and hydras, and chimeras dire'— is still the country of the unknown. You approach, and the cloud disperses, and that which, `afar off seen,' was terrible, not only becomes harmless when at hand, but lovely and inviting, perhaps, beyond all other prospects. A certain distance `lends enchantment to the view,' while an uncertain distance clothes it with evil aspects, fills it with —`All prodigious things, Abominable, inutterable and worse Than fables yet have feigned, or fear conceived.' In short, ignorance makes as many monsters as fear, and mankind for ages have shrunk from the possession of the garden spots of earth, through dread of those multiplied terrors which have been made to guard them, simply through the ministry of their own imaginations.” Saxon concurred with Vernon in his brief and natural view of the subject, and the conversation proceeded with a mutually increasing interest on both sides. The former spoke with fluency, and a considerable knowledge of the plain, the positive and practical. Like qualities of mind were observable in his companion, but warmed and elevated by a quick and vigorous imagination, which heightened the colour of his fancy, gave life to his delineations, and kindled his enthusiasm. This warmth suffered a check, and he himself received a warning, however, as he found the conversation, on the part of Saxon, gradually rising into a strain of complimentary remark, as the latter either felt, or affected to feel, the eloquence and wisdom of his companion's sentiments. The quick, sensitive mind of Vernon, which, like that of most ambitious men, had an instinctive dread of ridicule, was at once checked in its familiarity, and sunk back upon its caution and self-esteem for defence and protection. A cold, merely respectful and civil tone and form of expression, succeeded to the glow and energy of his previous manner; and Saxon, with that keen eye which belongs to the tactician, beheld the change, and readily comprehended its origin. His own manner was changed, his speech, more qualified and cautious; and though he took care that in what he said, the easy deference of his opinions should convey a no less flattering testimony to his companion's merits, he yet forebore any of those more open expressions of approval which he had imprudently administered ad nauseam. But the nice sense of moral delicacy once startled, it was not so easy for him to overcome the reluctance of Vernon to engage in any new freedom of dialogue. Not that the conversation flagged between them; the frankness alone was gone; the playful indifference of expression had passed away; and though speech was no less ready than before, yet caution watched the utterance, and truth was content to show herself only at the staid and squared portals of opinion. With some dexterity, Saxon contrived to re-open the topic which had suggested itself to them at their first meeting—that, namely, which arose naturally from the wild and equivocal character of the country, and its evil influence over the supposed physical resources of the soil. It was an easy transition, which the outlaw did not feel at all scrupulous to make, to the frequent robberies and misdemeanours in the neighbourhood. He spoke of them, as all spoke of them, as frequent and sometimes coupled with greater crimes; but at the same time, seizing upon an expressed opinion of Vernon, he declared them to be infamously exaggerated, and deplored the evils to the country of such an unhappy notoriety as belonged to it. “It is, in fact, in the absence of citizens that these things happen. Our population is guiltless, I am sure, of any participation in them; and these crimes are committed by those only who make our territory a stage for their villanous performances. Had we a community sufficiently dense to act with any thing like unanimity—indeed, had we any one or two men, calculated by ability and energy to take a lead, and bring our men together, nothing, I am sure, would be more easy than to put a stop to these excesses. We might soon, by lynching a few, keep the rest in order, and in good time, the want of means and money would compel labour, which is all that is wanting to good morals in any country.” This was all very fairly and frankly said; the truth of the latter opinion could not well be denied; but Vernon, though suppressing every thing like apparent suspicion, was yet suspicious; and once startled, he was one of those keen, restless minds that cannot be quieted, short of utter confirmation on one side or the other. The mistimed complimentary speeches of Saxon still occupied his thoughts, and were productive in him of some such musings as filled the mind of the Prince of Denmark under not dissimilar circumstances. The theatrical reference which his companion employed in one part of his speech, reminded him at the same moment of his quondam friend, Horsey, and the phlegmatic and indecisive Dane.—Why should he flatter so poor a man as Hamlet? Such applauses to one's beard were not in ordinary use in that time and country; and however grateful to such a man as Horsey, were scarcely pleasing to him, unless it were that his companion regarded him also as one of the players just “come hither.” At all events, the effect upon Vernon was to counsel him to more caution, but to no reserve; and with this policy in view, he expressed himself very freely in accordance with the opinions of Saxon, which, indeed, happened to be precisely such as he had uttered at the council-board of old Badger,—if that might be called a place of council where the chairman—as very often happens to venerable chairmen—was pretty much resolved from the beginning to have his own way. It occurred very naturally that he should relate his recent adventures on the other side of the river—so much, at least, as related to the attack of the robbers, and his own slight hurt in defence of the traveller. “I then,” he concluded, “in a conversation with a very worthy and respectable old gentleman,—a Mr. Badger, with whom I remained a brief space, in consequence of my hurt,—came to this very conclusion, though in direct opposition with himself. He was for turning out the trainbands at once and searching the swamp,—a labour which, I fear, will be utterly fruitless. The same scoundrels that assailed Mr. Wilson, are, I doubt not, full fifty miles off before this time.” The keen eye of Saxon surveyed the speaker with a glance which seemed intended to penetrate his soul; but the calm, indifferent countenance of Vernon baffled the inquiry. “This fellow,” thought the outlaw, “is either a most admirable tactician, or I have taken a very unnecessary labour. But, let the game be played out. We are now, sir,” speaking aloud, “we are now within sight of one of the prettiest little villages in this country. They call it Lucchesa—after some Italian city, I believe. We are all monstrous fond of going to Europe for names which would be found more appropriate, and quite as smooth and musical at home. But call Lucchesa by what name you will, you will admit when you see it that it is one of the sweetest spots that could be found any where for a village. It lies among gentle risings, which here may be called hills; and which so completely surround, as to leave it but a single opening for entrance, and that seems only to be scooped out for the purpose, and not natural. The woods, you see, are thick —the old forests are barely trimmed to let in the daylight, as it were, and give room for the cottages. These are better built and more neatly decorated than is often the case in our country villages; washed with lime, which answers the purpose of the best white lead for a season or more; and, peeping through the green openings here and there, they seem to be the pleasantest little temples that were ever yet raised by humility to happiness. I think I could spend my days in this little village, without ever desiring to look down on the outer side of the hills which surround it.” “You live here then?” was the natural question of Vernon. “Yes, I may say so,” was the somewhat evasive answer; “I live here when not elsewhere. But it is not permitted us to choose our habitations any more than to choose our graves. No man can say, death shall seek me here, however much he might pray for it.” Saxon was on the verge of Badgerism, as the two entered the little and lovely, but scattered village of Lucchesa. It seemed a settlement of some fifteen or twenty families—the cottages gleaming in a broken circle from among the trees, planted without much reference to each other, but amply gaining in picturesqueness what they might have lacked in regularity. Some of these were girdled and guarded by little low white palings, that followed the hill slopes on which they stood; some were fenced by hedges of the wild rose or the box, and among the small trees and bushes, and the bush myrtles, or spreading cedars that filled up the space between, the multiflora and the perpetual rose leapt and twined itself even around the topmost branches. A few pale sycamores rose up majestically amid the dwarf foliage that filled the valley, and ran down the slopes, giving a staid and solemn air to a scene that otherwise presented no other aspect than one of unqualified sweetness. But one object more than all gratified the eye of the observer, in the little stream that came stealing and whispering out from the hollow in which the village stood, by the only portal that led into it, with the sly, smiling glance of the truant boy, availing himself of the opportunity and open door, to steal away from the guarded circuit, and lose himself for awhile among the thick groves, that had beguiled him from a distance so often and so sweetly before. While Vernon looked round admiringly upon a scene that seemed strangely placed on the very confines of savage life, he suddenly found himself confronted by two persons, who, with the air of men having a perfect right to his attention, demanded to know his name. “My name, gentlemen!—my name is Vernon; but your demand is something singular. You will oblige me with your reason.” “Oh, yes; that's all fair enough; Harry, or Henry Vernon—that's right, a'n't it, sir?” said one of the men, drawing forth a paper. “It is, sir,” was the reply of Vernon with increasing surprise, and a slight increase of colour in the cheek, and that dilation of the nostril which denotes the swelling choler. Saxon, meanwhile, looked on with well-affected astonishment. “Then, sir, if you're the man, we are commanded to arrest you, in the name of the state, for murder.” “Murder!” “Yes, murder!—the murder of one Thomas Horsey, a young gentleman from below that you travelled with a few days past.” VOL. II. 2 “Horsey dead! Can it be possible? This is the strangest matter, sir, and—but show me your warrant.” “Let us go into the tavern, Mr. Vernon,” said Saxon, sympathisingly, “and you can there look more calmly into this business.” Upon this hint the party went forward, Doe and Roe taking care to environ our hero in such a manner, that escape, were he disposed to try it, would have been impossible. Here, with feelings of no enviable character, Vernon examined the instrument which had been issued for his taking. He found it to be a criminal warrant, proper in its forms, and issued by one William Nawls, a regularly acting magistrate. Had an enemy confronted our hero with intent to kill, the absolute danger would have produced less disquiet and annoyance in his mind than did the simple instrument which he perused and re-persued, absolutely bewildered and confounded for the moment. That Horsey should have been murdered, however sudden and unexpected this event, was certainly far from being improbable in a neighbourhood where he, himself, but a few days before, had a foretaste of a similar fate awaiting him. But that he should be made liable for his fate, and arrested for his murder, was one of those contingencies which, a moment before, he would have regarded as too remote and ridiculous a possibility to occasion any other feeling than merriment in his mind. “Gentlemen,” he said to the constables, “I can scarce recover from my surprise at this strange accusation. Pray, on whose oath was this warrant issued? What testimony furnished the grounds for this charge?” “Well, I read the oath, too,” said one of the officers, “but if I was to be shot, I couldn't say if the man's name was Walker or Wilkins. It was one or t'other, I could safely swear, but which, there's no telling. Hows'ever, I don't reckon it makes much difference now—you can see all about it when you get before the judge.” “True, true—Justice Nawls!”—turning to the landlord, and showing the signature of the warrant —“Is this name that of a gentleman acting as a magistrate here, sir?” “Not here, sir, but a few miles off, on the Georgeville road,” was the reply of the landlord. “A mighty good man is Judge Nawls,” said one of the bystanders. “It was only last week he prayed sarchingly at Green Brier meeting, and the sperit worked in him so, that the sweat stood round his eyes jist the same as he'd been a-ploughing.” “'Twan't the sperit, Dill, 'twas only the flesh that worked so mightily,” said another of the bystanders. “'Twas because he had none of the sperit that the flesh had to do so much, and I'm mighty sure Bill Nawls never found harder work at the plough in all his life, than he did at that ar' very sarmon.” “Well, and worn't it a good one, John Richards?” “A good one! Well, I can't say what you may think it, but for myself I can say such a sermon will never carry me very far along the narrow track. There's no getting to heaven by a preaching where there's no getting steam up; and it's a matter of small wonder that so many take the other road, and go down to the big pit, when it depends upon the sweating of Bill Nawls's flesh to keep 'em from it. But that's not to say, stranger, that Nawls aint a good judge. He's a most onbecoming person, that'll see all sides of your case, and do you justice enough —though, to be sure, he's mighty slow, and takes a particular long time to get through any writing. I've seen him take jist as long a time, now, to get round the body of an `o,' or an `e,' as I would to put on the tire of a great wagon wheel, drive the nails, and swing it on the body.” The merits of Judge or Justice Nawls as a man and preacher, thus made the subject of popular disputation around him, was very little edifying to our hero; and just at this point of the dispute his eye caught, on a sudden, the glimpse of an object which, for the moment, almost caused an entire forgetfulness of the predicament in which he stood. This was no other than the carriage of Wilson—otherwise Maitland—which he beheld, denuded of its trunks and the other paraphernalia of the travellers, yet evidently occupied, as if for an evening ride, by its proprietor and his family. A mere glimpse was afforded him of this vehicle, as it rapidly passed along the common highway, and a feeling of exulting satisfaction, which had its source in mingled emotions, sprang up in his bosom. Once more the object of his pursuit seemed to be within his grasp;— he did not, it may be added, fail to perceive that the daughter of Maitland was with him still, though it never entered his thoughts, at this early stage of their acquaintance, that she, too, had become an object of his pursuit. The desire to see the latter, had, without his own consciousness, quite as much influence over him, as the feeling of duty which prompted him to secure the former; and with these desires in his mind, uttering an exclamation, he was about to rush to the entrance of the tavern, when his arm was forcibly grappled by the officers. “Not so fast, my lark. That cock won't fight, I can tell you,” exclaimed one of the constables, while a brutal burst of laughter from both, reminded him of his predicament, which the sight of the carriage of Maitland had moved him momentarily to forget. “Unhand me, fellows, for an instant. I would see and speak to the gentleman in that carriage;” and he almost shook himself free as he spoke, while his efforts were such as to render necessary all of theirs to secure him. “Be quiet, man, before I put a spur into you,” cried one of the fellows, taking him at the same time by the collar, and putting on a threatening and insolent look, that goaded Vernon to a degree of forgetfulness and fury, to which the sudden arrest of his previous movement had already greatly moved him. “Dog!” he exclaimed, striking down the arm that grasped his collar, and driving his clenched fist into the fellow's face in the instant with a force that sent him to the floor, “do you think I will suffer this?” “Help! help!” cried the second officer, “an escape! Citizens, I command you, help, help!— stop the murderer!” “Cease howling, fool!” exclaimed Vernon, “I seek not to escape. I would speak but a moment with the owner of yon carriage.” His words were disregarded; the constable clung to him with the tenacity of a bull-dog, that clings still though it may not conquer, and Vernon had already dragged him almost to the entrance, when a short, stout Irishman, who lay upon a bench in the room, and who, to this moment, had looked on the fray with the most placid indifference, now sprang to his feet, and lifting a bludgeon that had lain concealed behind him, felled Vernon to the ground with a single blow. He would have repeated the stroke, when a stranger interposed,—a young Alabamian who had also just arrived in the village—and catching the lifted arm with a grasp that fixed it in its position, exclaimed: “Stick down, my lad! There go two hands to this bargain. What the devil sort of soul do you think you have, d—n you, to strike a man that is speechless?” 2* “Thunder and turf, my honey! do you mane to make me your inimy?” cried the Hibernian. “Would ye be after resaving a tap on yer own pate, my honey?” “Devil-may-care if I do, but you can't give it me, nor any lad of your inches,” cried the Alabamian, who in the same moment lifted the astonished Irishman to his full height in the air, in defiance of all his struggles, and then dropped him down with as little reluctance as if he had been one of the most insensible “p'raties” of his fatherland. “There, Patrick, what do you say to that, and be d—d to you?” A battle to the death was nearly the consequence of this display of prowess on the part of the Alabamian, who, no ways loth, prepared for it with the utmost sang froid, and answered the threats of Patrick with a swaggering and cool defiance, which denoted the most perfect confidence in himself. But it was not the policy of Saxon, who recognised a follower in Dennis O'Dougherty, to suffer it. He interposed to keep the peace, and used all the usual and effective arguments common to cases of such urgent necessity. The bar supplied the means of bringing about a pacification, quite as often as it promotes the strifes and vexations which lead to war, and the Alabamian expressed himself as clearly of opinion that the fun was quite as great to drink, as to fight, with a stout fellow. “As for Patrick, here—” “Dennis, if you plase—Dennis O'Dougherty, of the O'Doughertys of Ballyshannon by the pit of Ballany—a family of the ouldest—there's no telling, indade, when the O'Doughertys were not a family of the ouldest.” “That accounts for your loss of strength, Mr. O'Dougherty,” said the Alabamian; “if you hadn't come from so old a family, I should not have tumbled you so easily. Your great-grandfather must have been rather a stout chap in his time, and it might have given me more trouble to spring him to the ceiling. But the blood gets mighty thin going through three, or five, or seven generations, unless the breed is crossed mighty often. Now, don't you see the advantage of being of a new family? In my state, all the men are of new families, and we've got the strength in us. Perhaps, the time will come that our children will grow weak and feeble like you, Dennis, and some chap, away from the Red River, or the Sabine—some new fellow from Texas or thereabouts—will swing the grandson of Dick Jamison just as easily as he can swing you, Dennis.” “Asily, do you say, Misther Dick Jeemison!” exclaimed Dennis; “not so asy, my honey, if the thing is to be thried agin. You had the back of me, Mr. Dick Jeemison, an' that's a rason why you should come to the front. But, shall it be for a quart, that we shall take a friendly gripe at the ribs, or will it be the shillelah, my honey?” “Stick, fist, or hug, Dennis O'Dougherty, it's all the same to Dick Jamison. You're of too old a family, Dennis, to stand up with a young man from Alabama; the stuff's not in you, my lad, and I should swallow you at a mouthful and never ask after the salt.” “Now, don't ye be after desaving yerself, my honey,” replied the Irishman, somewhat astounded at the cool impudence of the Alabamian, not merely in disparaging his hitherto acknowledged powers, but in the still more remarkable disparagement of the greater merits of an old family, which, to the great horror and surprise of Dennis, were now made to give way to the claims of a young one. The almost contemptuous terms which the member of the new house employed in determining the proper precedence of the latter, uttered with so much complacency, tended still more to embitter the idea. “Now, don't ye be after desaving yerself, Mr. Dick Jeemison, saing it was behind my back that ye overkim Dennis O'Dougherty; and don't ye be after thinking that ye can overkim him again behind his back, when his face is turned upon ye. There's a difference, my honey, between a jontleman's face and his back, that ye'll be after belaving when ye've sane them together as I will show ye mine, with a shillelah in aitch hand, and a pistol in the other, and the spirit of univarsal liberty in the sowl which will make a rivolution in your ideas, Mr. Dick Jeemison, and tache you a leetle abolition of doctrine, that ye may take back with ye to Alabama.” “Abolition!” exclaimed one of the inmates of the bar. “Abolition!” echoed another and another, and a dozen faces were peering into the face of the Hibernian at the inauspicious word. “Who's talking abolition here?” said one. “What blasted emissary of Arthur Tappan is it?” “It's his own self, I do think,” said a third; and the murmurs began to close with the ominous inquiry after that venerable border magistrate, Judge Lynch. “Jontlemen!” exclaimed the Hibernian, who began to feel some misgivings that his position might be made a very awkward one, if the Alabamian should happen to take the lead against him. “Jontlemen!” said he, turning from one to the other, with an air of mingled apology and defiance, “don't be after desaving yourselves, and misconsaving Dennis O'Dougherty. I'm a jontleman by my mother's side,—she was an O'Flaherty—” “To be sure; don't you suppose, Dennis, that we know all that?” said the Alabamian; “look you, friends and fellow-citizens, we all know what Dennis means by abolition, but being an Irishman born, and of an old family that's nearly worn out, how should he be able to speak good English. He is a gentleman, as he says, by the mother's side—his mother being an O'Flaherty; and a lady by his father's side, the old gentleman being an O'Dougherty; and therefore he asks you all to join with him here in a sup of whisky,—regular Monongahela,—that we may have a revolution of ideas and an abolition of distinctions. That's what Dennis means by abolition, only the poor fellow hasn't been long enough in America to speak good English. And, look you, my friends, it's not a bad notion now, I tell you, for a man whose family's almost worn out, to wish to abolish distinctions where our families are only just beginning. He'd be mighty willing to let that matter drop, and so you see he's for giving us a drop all round; so come, Kitty, fill your quart and set out the sugar, and look you, friends, we'll drink to the health of Mr. Dennis O'Dougherty, who is a gentleman by his mother's side, and a lady by his father's; and may he soon recover his strength by getting into a new family.” This speech was received with loud huzzas. The explanation of the Alabamian, as it was only understood in part, was perfectly satisfactory to all parties; the countrymen around were satisfied with it, as its result was one easily swallowed and perfectly habitual; and the Hibernian, though there was much in the speech to confound his better judgment, and stagger his conception of the English he already knew, was also content to receive it without scruple as explanatory of his own ideas, simply as he found it so successful with all around, and as it relieved him from a predicament, which some recent examples had already convinced him, might have become an awkward, if not a dangerous one. A more general diffusion of the peace principle was evident soon after the quart flagon was placed upon the counter of the publican, and the Alabamian, who was something of a wag, and no little of a democrat, was soon busy in labouring to convince Dennis that there was no greater misfortune on earth than to be the descendant of a very old family; as he proceeded to show by every analogous case, drawn from the history of bird, beast and reptile, that the breed must degenerate, with every successive advance, after the fifth generation; and the only hope of an old nation was to merge itself, as soon as possible after that period, in the body and bosom of a new. The final speech of Mr. Jamison, at the moment when we propose to leave the company, may be put on record as containing a proposition of quite as much political truth as theory. “It's in America here, Dennis, my boy, that we will preserve the English, and the Irish, and the Scotch, when, in your own country, you'll all be worked down to a mere stump of what you were. It's here, I tell you, that the English people will get a new growth, a height and a depth, a breadth and a bottom, when the old families wouldn't have one fellow among 'em fit to carry guts to a bear. This is the country, after all, to make men out of your sticks, jist the same as taking a plant from one place where it's been growing so long that it's come to nothing, and putting it into a new field where it never was before. See the difference! how it shoots up—how it spreads, and what a fine crop you get from it for the first five years—maybe seven,— but after that you must carry it farther off to some new opening, and begin again. If I was to do any thing for you, Dennis, I'd marry you off at once to Polly Whitesides,—you all know Polly Whitesides, my boys?”—A general laugh attested the success of the reference.—“I'd marry you off to Polly Whitesides, of Beattie's Bluff, and make a new family out of an old one.” “It's a lady you spake of, Mr. Dick Jeemison?” “Ay, to be sure, a lady—what else? She's six feet in her stockings, with cheeks red as a gobbler's gills, and an arm, Dennis, that would put your thigh out of countenance!” “J—s! and she's a lady, Mr. Jeemison?” “And the very gal to make a new and rising family out of an old one on its last legs,” was the reply. Let us change the scene, and follow Vernon into the apartment into which he was carried at the moment when the blow from the shillelah of Dennis O'Dougherty had laid him senseless on the floor.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER II. “Now we have argument Of justice, and our very breath is law, To speak thee dead at once.” Shirley. While the uproarious controversy was in progress between the Alabamian and his Irish opponent in the tavern-hall, Vernon, through the considerateness and care of Saxon, was conveyed to an inner apartment in a state of insensibility. The outlaw had his unexpressed objects in this disposition of the youth, and his connexion with the constables readily enabled him to make such arrangements as left him in his sole custody. A public assurance which he gave them in the bar-room, that he would be answerable for the forthcoming of the prisoner whenever they might demand him, not only satisfied the worthy emissaries of the law, but won golden opinions for the outlaw from the unreflecting spectators. They did not, with a single exception, remark the strangeness of such a proceeding; nor wonder, as well they might, how it was that a stranger's assurance, and one who appeared to have been the companion of the traveller, should be taken as good security for the temporary release of the same person charged with a crime so heinous. The more acute Alabamian saw this matter in its true light, and was not the less curious though he said nothing on the subject. As for the constables, the reader, who knows already what they are, will not be surprised at the ready complaisance which they yielded to the will of the outlaw. They were very well satisfied to exchange the tedious watch over the prisoner for the livelier bustle of the tavern-hall. There they soon joined the revellers, and gave themselves up to that perfect recklessness of good order and morality, which, in no little degree, tended to confirm the growing suspicion in the mind of the Alabamian that there was something wrong in their proceedings. A sudden regard for Vernon had been the fruit of the first moment of their meeting; as he saw, or fancied he saw, even through the reserve which is usually the accompaniment of superior endowments and education, a frankness of manner and character in the youth, which, while resembling, was grateful to his own. These first loves, or favourable impressions, are very common to a forest country such as ours, where no long time is allowed for the formation of intimacies, and where the instincts of blood are always more active than the slow and cautious approaches of reason and philosophy. He assisted, we may state, to carry the insensible form of the youth into the chamber, and having ascertained that Lucchesa was not without its physician, he despatched one of the urchins that lingered at the tavern-door, to require his assistance; a task which the boy readily undertook with the tempting reward of a fip-penny-piece before him. This done, Jamison returned to his controversy with the Irishman, which he made subservient to the occult purposes of inquiry which lay at the bottom of his mind. He plied the whisky flagon with an industry which he took pains to make appear as the consequence of his own love for the living beverage; and he soon VOL. II. 3 had occasion to congratulate himself on the discovery of one or two facts, which, though subordinate in importance, were yet of a character to confirm him in his suspicions. He soon discovered, in the first place, that his Irish adversary, in one or two unwitting speeches, was an old acquaintance of the constables; and, from the modes of speech and the sort of anecdote in which the latter freely dealt, he was easily led to infer that, however honest they might be at this writing, they had certainly, at some past period not so very remote, been very exemplary picaroons. That their morals were not such as should entitle them to the selection of a devout magistrate such as Judge Nawls had been described to be, was sufficiently clear from the facility with which they threw aside that starched semblance of decency which they had just before put on in the assumption of a character, and in the performance of duties, far other than those to which they had been sworn. They soon forgot the commands of their leader, who was too busy elsewhere to heed their behaviour, and hear their riotous uproar; as, in the person of Dennis O'Dougherty they recognised a well known Jack Pudding of their gang; and the renewal of sundry old jokes at his expense, did more than any thing beside to convey to the mind of the acute and unsuspected Alabamian, the extent and sort of intimacy which had before subsisted between them. Their presence brought no little increase of merriment to the carousing party. The fun had been about to decline till their appearance. A renewal of mirth was the necessary consequence of the arrival of such old proficients, and the replenishing of the flagon furnished an equal supply of the pabulum so necessary for the fervour of village wit, and the otherwise costive humour of a country population. Our friend Jamison, speaking from his soul, cried, “d—n the expense,” at every hearty summons to the company to refill—a summons not less grateful than imperative, and one never to be disputed among men, no less social in character than docile in obedience to the lawful authority. Leaving these good companions for awhile, let us seek the chamber to which Vernon had been carried. This was a little low shed-room containing two beds, a single chair, a broken mirror, and a couple of rude coloured pictures, such as good taste was willing to take, without scruple, during the war of 1815, at the hands of patriotism. Never did native genius effect a more rascally portraiture of humanity. One of the pictures represented the battle of New Orleans; the other a scalping-scene at the massacre of Fort Mimms, on the Tensaw. In the former, Packenham might have been seen going through the air like one of his own congreves, as blazing red, certainly, and describing pretty much the same sort of curve when at the moment of declension. His head nearly touched his heels, and the grapeshot might have been seen just about to bury their hissing hot bodies in the gaping wounds, from which the blood was already streaming, in pretty much the same volume as would issue from the sudden opening of a water-plug in the streets of Philadelphia. A complete display of pyrotechnics—a shower of fire —encircled him, and formed the only light, lurid and sulphurous still, which the artist permitted on the British side of the business. In this he strove hard to accomplish the clair obscur with the utmost practical nicety. The rest of the battle was a chaos of heads, legs, and arms; horses kicking without bodies; men running without feet, and wheeling cannon just as busy advancing and receding, though never a man was left standing at the drag-ropes. Here imagination had done much towards the achievement of that desideratum in all her works, the vague, twilight, picturesque, and imperfect dimness, which denotes every thing that is not beheld, and makes equivocal whatever is distinct. But the amor patriæ was predominant in the display of the American lines —there all was clear, effulgent, and imposing. Still and stern the Kentuckians and Tennesseeans, stood upon the terraces. Never were attitudes more perfect. Even those who knelt for the purpose of better aim, were drawn with wonderful exactitude and majesty. Here was truth. The eyes ranged the tube with a mathematical exactness. Had you taken the instruments in hand, and separated the lines between the eyes, the drop, and the British, you would have seen in an instant how certain was their defeat. Every muzzle covered its man—every bullet had its special commission; and our artist had made it a matter sufficiently clear, without reference to any dull history, that the American victory arose from no other cause than the excellent aim of the riflemen. The whole story was told at a glance; and when you recollect that the artillery was managed with similar nicety, you have no sort of difficulty in accounting for all the havoc of that bloody field. But the whole powers of the artist were concentrated around the form of the hero of that day. General Jackson was surrounded with a thousand natural glories. The sun rose over his left shoulder, and his epaulet, reflecting his light upon surrounding objects, was almost as bright, and quite as large, as himself. “Bombs bursting in air” surrounded him with halos of falling stars that became tributary, in like manner, to the awful distinctness of his face and figure. There he stood, “Fierce as ten furies, terrible as hell.” His portrait was true, as all the portraits of very great men must be true, even when most imperfect. There were the same thin pale cheeks, the raised cheek-bones, thin compressed lips, keen eyes, high narrow forehead, and raised hair—the head, for the greater perfection of the portrait, having been left uncovered, in defiance of smoke and flame, bombs and rockets, crackers and carcasses. But the terrors of expression in his face were the wonders of the performance. Even had the riflemen been utterly wanting to the battle, you would have seen that these were enough for the victory. There was not a wrinkle in the old warrior's brow that did not look like a two-edged sword. His mouth was pursed up to seem a seam—the lines forming to a common centre, the appearance of which led you to expect a sudden expansion, no less great than the undue contraction, from which triple hail and thunder was to issue. His beard, too—for the general, if the artist may be considered good authority in a particular so perfectly domestic, had not shaved for seven days—his very beard, too, like that of old Giaffar, “curled in ire,” as he waved a sword twice his own length, and pointing to Packenham's whizzing and whirling carcass, seemed disposed to thrust it—very unnecessarily, it would seem—into the aperture made so voluminously large already by the grapeshot aforesaid. Language fails to do justice to this terrific picture—go to Lucchesa, reader, and see for yourself. We forbear that of the massacre at Fort Mimms, in order that nothing may be anticipated. Like that of the battle, it is a painting sui generis. Never were scalps taken from skulls with more terrible felicity of execution than in this picture. At Raymond court-house you will see another, by the same artist, in which a muse more moral than she of history has been invoked;—Justice with her scales very properly presides over the hall of justice. It is rather awkward, indeed, that 3* one scale should be lower than the other, but this difference simply suggests a play of the fancy, and cannot subject the painter to the imputation of any serious want of discrimination. Certainly, we shall venture to incur no risk, in this brief passage, of indulging in false and superficial analysis. Strange to say, the merits of these pictures entirely escaped the notice of Saxon. Whether he had seen them before, or, as is quite probable, entertained no taste for the fine arts—a deficiency quite too general in our country, and quite too common among all people whose habits are wandering to make it likely that any rebuke will be of service for a hundred years to come—one thing is certain, that he never gave so much as a glance to the panels in which these gorgeous performances had been set on high. His eye and thought was upon the young man alone, who lay insensible upon the couch; and, under the pretence of restoring him to consciousness, the outlaw, so soon as all other persons had retired from the chamber, very coolly proceeded to unbutton the vest and bosom of his patient, and explore the contents of a thin gause-like handkerchief which encircled his waist, and which he untied with the dexterity of an old proficient in all such practices, without disturbing the position of, or removing the handkerchief from, the body. A few moments sufficed to enabled him to disengage from the folds of the handkerchief a small packet which lay on the right side of the youth. This he transferred with all speed to his own bosom; and, folding a newspaper in like bulk and form, he deposited it in place of the papers appropriated, retied the handkerchief, rebuttoned the shirt and vest; and all this without disturbing the wounded man and before the arrival of the physician;—an event, however, which occurred the moment after. Dr. Saunders was rather a clever young man, who had received a license to practice but a few months before, and was no less modest than well-informed. He examined the hurt of Vernon with the assistance of the Alabamian who, on the arrival of the physician, left the company without, and with the anxiety of an old friend awaited the result. Vernon had over-tasked himself. The wound in his thigh which had bled so copiously was irritated by the hard riding of the day. He had ridden rapidly in order to overtake the carriage of Wilson, and had overcome a distance of more than forty miles. The excitement following previous events, and the anticipation of those before him, had also contributed to the irritation of his system; and, when arrested for so heinous an offence as that of murder, and the murder, too, of his late companion, it is not improbable that fever would have followed his mental suffering even without the additional injury which he received from the unmeasured blow of the Irishman. The patient's consciousness returned while the examination of the physician was going on. He started, and with an instinctive movement which betrayed the deep interest which he had at stake, he threw off the intrusive hands about him, and his own were thrust into his bosom and not withdrawn until he assured himself of the safety of the secret deposit which he had bound around his body. With anxiety and agitation heightened by fever, he turned to the two attendants, and demanded what was meant by their familiarities. The matter was soon explained, the doctor announced himself, and coming slowly to a recollection of what had taken place in the tavern, Vernon quietly submitted himself to his hands. Meanwhile, in the possession of his prize and anxious for its examination, Saxon availed himself of the coming of the physician to retire to another apartment. There, in secret, he unfolded the packet, the contents of which had the instant effect of clouding his brow with anger, and sending the blood into his cheeks. “It is then true,—it is as I thought and feared! This is then only another Hurdis—another spy, self-appointed, for our destruction. He has played his game admirably, but not perfectly. Not well enough for success, but so well as to make it necessary that we should silence him for ever. It is needful for our own safety that we do this—we can spare no longer—his doom is written.” He conned the papers closely; one of which, a blank commission with the signature of Governor R—, he tore into fragments and flung into the fireplace. The others comprised a brief narration of his own doings as Clem Foster in Alabama; copies of affidavits sworn to in that state, and a list of names,—a copy of which had been given to Rawlins by Vernon the night before,—of suspected persons in Mississippi. These called for the more serious attention of the outlaw. “These must fly,” he muttered, as he looked over, and pencilled off, a portion of the list,—“the neighbourhood is closely settled and will soon be too hot to hold them; but they may stave off danger here on the Big Black for a year or two more. Still it will be as well to warn off some of the more black and crooked—fellows who cannot even look honest, may well run in advance of the danger. But Cane Castle will hide all their vices, and that is as far as they need go for the present. This agent of his Excellency—would he had come himself—once fairly salted, and we shall have no trouble for some time to come. There are few in Mississippi prepared to take his place, and manage his cards so cunningly as almost to blind so old a stager as myself. His game's up—and there's an end of it. Nawls will send him to Vicksburg, and the `beagles' will take him by the way. Then follows his execution, in terrorem, for the benefit of our own doubtful and soft-hearted fellows in the swamp. He will die by our laws—he has assumed the toils of the spy—he incurs its dangers; and our own require that we should show no mercy. And now for a little more hypocrisy. I would know why he seeks this traveller, Wilson,—and the hurry of Wilson to leave old Badger's, is no less curious. I must sound him on these subjects.” With exemplary composure he proceeded to the apartment of Vernon which was still occupied by the physician and the Alabamian, and placing himself on one side of the patient, congratulated him on his improved looks and restoration. The compliment was a very suspicious one, for, by this time, our hero felt himself seriously ill—he could not mistake the heat of his frame; the bounding quickness of his pulse; the parching thirst which assailed him; the soreness of his head, and the painful throbbing of his wounded thigh. These were evidences, even if the physician had been absent, sufficient to make him aware of his true condition. “I thank you,” he said, “but I am not better. I feel ill—seriously ill; and this painful accusation, this troublesome arrest! So strange, so sudden and startling:—I trust, gentlemen”—looking round as he spoke—“I trust that you believe me guiltless of this crime—nay, it must be so,—the officers are gone,—they have been convinced of their mistake, I suppose.” “Mistake!” said Saxon, with an incredulous expression—“what mistake, Mr. Vernon?” “Why, sir, mistake of facts or of person. Did they not arrest me for murder—the murder of Horsey, poor fellow?” “Yes, sir, but if it be a mistake, it is one of those mistakes that they continue obstinately to persist in. They are in the adjoining hall. It was on my pledge that you should be forthcoming that they consented to leave you in privacy until you might be recovered from your injuries.” “I thank you, sir, again I thank you,” replied Vernon—“it is due to the kindness of your interposition, and to the attention of these gentlemen, that I should assure you, that I am wholly guiltless of the crime which is charged against me, —that, so far from seeking to harm the unfortunate young man, whose fate I have heard of for the first time from this proceeding, I should feel myself bound by every duty and feeling to succour and to save him. He is a wild, hairbrained, but worthy youth, whose family is good, and whose old father has treated me with kindness. That I may be suspected is, perhaps, not so strange:—we travelled together and separated suddenly—he, taking the lower road for Benton at the forks, and I, the upper, which, with some delays and interruptions, has led me here. That he may have fallen a victim to some wanton assassin is, perhaps, little surprising in a neighbourhood in which crime is said to be so frequent; but that I should be seriously held to answer for his death is a matter too idle to annoy me much or make me apprehensive of its consequences. I have no sort of doubt, gentlemen, that an examination before the magistrate will result in my immediate discharge from arrest.” The company unanimously expressed their hopes that such might be the result; and Jamison loudly declared his conviction of it. “The truth's in your face, Mr. Vernon,—I saw it from the first, and that made me so willing to give Paddy O'Rafferty or O'Dougherty, or whatever O' it may be, an ugly hoist, for the liberty he took with you, bringing you soon to an acquaintance, all on one side, between your head and his shillelah. He'll not do it again, I'm thinking, not while Dick Jamison is bystanding. I know well enough you'll get out of this scrape, so cheer up, Mr. Vernon. I'll see you out of the mire while I've got any footing to stand on, and when I ha'n't, why I'll walk the bog with you. D—e, but I like your face, and there's no telling what I'll do and say for a fellow I like. I'll run, ride, talk and fight for my friend; and when he's a stranger like myself in a new place, that's the very time that I can't desert him. So count upon Dick Jamison while the breath's in him.” The expressive eye of Vernon made an acknowledgment to the hearty volunteer, which his lips did not articulate; and his hand freely returned the pressure which the latter gave him as he concluded his characteristic speech. The sympathies of the stranger, however rudely expressed, were grateful to the youth in the feeling of discontent and depression which was natural to his condition; and the unstudied frankness of his utterance was only an additional proof that his sentiments came from the fellow's heart. The reflections of Vernon's mind were no ways cheering at this moment. His course, upon which he had entered with so much confidence and hope, had been attended with disasters from the beginning, produced, not through his own measures or management, but by influences entirely foreign. Pursued by Horsey and annoyed by his prying curiosity—scarcely freed from him, before suffering in an encounter into which he was forced by a sense of duty which no honourable mind could shrink from; and now, arrested and suffering for the alleged murder of the man whose presence was so perfectly unsought and so undesirable:—these continuous events seemed to hold forth auguries the most inauspicious to that adventure which had been undertaken with so much hope. The voice of kindness came to him, therefore, at the moment of his despondency, with an influence to be remembered; and he felt that he was not altogether desolate while the sturdy Alabamian was beside his couch. The truth, which was declared by his frank utterance, and denoted in the manly and not-to-be mistaken expression of his features, won instant confidence from our hero; and remembering one of his leading objects, he thought to himself, “here is another ally—here is another to join with me in the strifes that may follow any pursuit of this banditti.” The wounds upon Vernon's thigh were re-dressed —the irritation of the part soothed by the application of external dressings; his head, which had suffered a severe contusion, was properly bandaged, a nostrum given intended to lessen the fever, in the attainment of which object, a vein was also opened. This done, Doctor Saunders proceeded to silence the worthy Alabamian, whose tongue was one of those habitually restless ones, which, suspended in the roof of his mouth, rather than the gap of his throat, are for ever wagging from side to side in the fruitless hope of finding a place of rest. “We must leave our patient in quiet, gentlemen— his fever is high—his mind is not at ease, and the necessity of the case must be my apology for insisting upon his being left to himself.” “I will but say to the officers that I yield him to their custody,” said Saxon, leading the way to the bar-room. “They cannot remove him,” said the physician. “That is for them to determine,” was the reply of the outlaw. “It will be an unnecessary and wanton cruelty if they do. The young man cannot escape if he would. He is really too feeble. They may watch him, and be at hand, but must not intrude upon him.” “I'll be d—d if they do!” was the asseveration of the Alabamian, glad of an opportunity to use the instrument upon which the interdict of the physician, while in the chamber of the patient, sat with a very unpleasant weight. The keen eye of Saxon surveyed him for an instant with no very pleasant expression, but he said nothing; while the other proceeded to declare that, law or no law, he would see that none but himself should approach the sick man's chamber, and “as for taking him out,” he continued, “until he's willing to go himself, let me see any one try it, and if he don't bear a hickory, his mother never bore a fool.” The arrival of another party suggested, however, a new plan of arrangements. This was no other than the traveller whom Vernon had pursued— certainly, with no sort of apprehension on the part of the former, that such had been the case. Old Wilson entered with timid, trembling footsteps— a cautious tread, as if walking upon eggs—and a furtive glance thrown from side to side as the different groups of the bar-room met his eyes, which denoted either a very suspicious temper, or one strangely unused to the devil-may-care freedoms of a public tavern. As he advanced he encountered the three persons who had just emerged from the passageway into the public hall, and whose more respectable appearance, in garb and manner, than that of the persons generally by whom the tavern was filled, naturally prompted the visiter to address his inquiry to them. “Gentlemen, I would like to know—sorry to stop VOL. II. 4 you—but is there not a young gentleman here by the name of Vernon?” “There is,” answered Jamison, who already assumed the entire representation of his new friend. “Can I be suffered to see and speak with him?” inquired Wilson. “I am afraid not,” replied the physician. “Mr. Vernon has suffered some serious hurts which have brought on fever. Even the noise of this bar-room is unfavourable to him in his present situation. His mind is very much excited, and inclines to wander. I would prefer that he should not be disturbed.” There was some eagerness in the expression of Wilson's face, and in his manner, as he replied— “I have heard of his hurts, sir, and as I partly know him, and believe him to be a worthy young man, I came to propose that he might be taken to my house, while his illness lasted. It will be more quiet than he can possibly find it here, and—” “You, perhaps, have not heard of the accusation against him?” was the remark of Saxon. “And what the d—l has that to do with the gentleman's offer, I'd like to know?” was the fierce demand of the Alabamian. “I'm sure nobody who knows Vernon would think him guilty of the thing after his own lips had told 'em he hadn't done it.” Jamison spoke for his new friend as sturdily as if they had been intimate a thousand years. His manner startled and somewhat aroused the outlaw. This might be seen in the kindling and flashing of his eye, and in the sudden glow that flushed his cheek; but however much he might have been moved to resent it, there were other considerations, much more strong, that counselled forbearance; and the reply of Mr. Wilson to his inquiry, interposed, as it were, between himself and the man who had shown himself so susceptible of provocation. “I have heard of the charge to which you allude, and which, I think with the gentleman here, must be quite groundless. It was the rumour which reached me of his arrest, and of his illness, but a little time ago, by which I was informed that he was in my neighbourhood; and the thought that he might be removed with advantage to my dwelling—” “This is an offer not to be disregarded,” said the physician, interrupting him; “and if the officers would permit his removal—” “Permit it—they must, and be d—d to them. Look you, men, this here prisoner of yours—he's in a d—d bad way, and will be worse, unless you let us carry him to the old gentleman's house. See you, I'll be bail for his coming whenever he's able to see the justice; or you can stay here, and keep on the look-out for him, and for me too if you choose, for I won't budge till the lad gets better. What do you say, you man-catching rascals, to being civil for awhile—it'll be nothing out of your pockets, I can tell you, while Dick Jamison has any thing in his.” The constables, at whose approach Mr. Wilson might have been seen to shrink with some trepidation, were not disposed to consent so readily. They hemmed and hawed awhile—muttered together as if in consultation—spoke aloud of their duties and the great risk and responsibility, and, from their delay and reluctance, were rousing up the choler of the irritable Alabamian to a new outbreak of ferocious friendship, when Saxon, to whom they looked entirely for their cue, quietly remarked— “It appears to me that the officers cannot refuse so reasonable an arrangement. They can keep as close a watch over the prisoner at the house of Mr. Wilson as at the tavern, and the doctor's opinion that the young man cannot fly in his present situation, and should be free from noise, ought to satisfy them without any other security; though, if they need any other, I'm ready to become bound in bail along with this gentleman.” “Will you?” said Jamison; “well, d—me, you're a better fellow than I thought you, after all—so give's a shake of your paw, and let there be peace between us. Well, what do you say, you sharks in fresh water, have you got your senses yet?” “Faith, we must let the jontleman off the hook, since ye all says it,” began the Irishman, when interrupted, no less by the stern expressive looks of Saxon, than by the sudden burst of his former opponent. “Hillo! Dennis! and what the d—l have you got to do in the business, my lad? Shut up, you little old fellow—you have no right to speak at all until you are fairly married into a new family. Get you gone to Polly Whitesides, and let her give you a brush up before you dip your oar into another's navigation.” And, with these words, the now good-humoured rowdy clapped his open hand as an effectual stopper on the widely distended jaws of the only half-sober son of St. Patrick, whose brain was just in that condition of fermentation when he could understand that he had blundered, though in what respect, he did not hope to divine, until he had taken an added supply of the “crather,” or utterly freed himself from the control of that which he had already swallowed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER III. “High-climbing rock—low sunless dale— Sea—desert—what do these avail?— Oh, take her anguish and her fears, Into a deep recess of years.” Wordsworth. The arrangement thus effected needed but the consent of the principal party to its immediate operation; and Mr. Wilson was ushered into Vernon's chamber by the ready aid of Dick Jamison. Our hero, though confused by his application as much as by certain medicines which had been administered by Doctor Saunders, was yet not insensible to the advantages in sundry respects which the contemplated removal might afford him. As an invalid, with the possible prospect before him of a protracted illness, it promised that repose and quiet which he felt would be grateful, if not necessary to his condition; and when he reflected on the probability of his being able to secure the main object of his journey, in a quiet pacific manner, and by degrees which would neither startle nor offend, he could not mistake the course which he should at once adopt. But still he hesitated, nay refused;—thanked the old gentleman for his hospitality and consideration —made light of his own services previously rendered, and, though in faltering accents, declared 4* himself utterly unwilling to transfer the cares of a sick bed, and that too of a stranger, to the household of his friendly visiter, and to the great interruption of its domestic privacy and quiet. The nice and jealous sensibility of Harry Vernon was busy to produce this determination; and feelings which he did not then seek to analyze—which he might not at that moment have perceived—influenced his declared resolution when all the obvious reasons of his mind fought against it. He remembered the lovely daughter of the defaulter; and when he reflected that it might become necessary to expose the crime of the father, he was unwilling to incur the reproaches—the probable and perhaps well-founded hostility—of one whose favourable opinion already grew in his mind the embodied standard of a becoming excellence. But the reluctance of our hero warmed the manner of the old man to something like persuasiveness—he urged many good reasons why the patient should consent—denied the inconvenience and annoyance—spoke of his own little household comforts, and to sum up all in brief, assured him that his consent alone would make easy the minds of himself and family, since the necessity under which they laboured of attending to some pressing interests had compelled them to leave their preserver on a previous occasion, with a seeming indifference to his condition which might well expose them to the charge of coldness and ingratitude. The objections of Vernon gradually vanished when he heard from the lips of the father that such was the argument of his daughter by which he had been moved to the offer; and it needed but the reasseveration of Dr. Saunders that the removal was full of promised benefit and might promote his more speedy restoration, to induce his full consent to the arrangement. Behold our hero then fairly admitted as a guest in the dwelling of the man whom he pursued as a fugitive. Two days only had passed since Mr. Wilson and his family had become occupants of the same household. They had pursued their way to this secluded and lovely spot, with direct steps, from the moment when they left the hospitable dwelling of the rigid Methodist. They had reached it late in the evening of the same day, and the night was too far advanced to enable them to behold the beauties of the locality. But the cottage, though small, was neat, and furnished with a larger attention to those things which are classed under the ordinary term “comforts,” than was commonly the case in a region so remote from the demands of fashionable society. Virginia Wilson beheld on all sides those little items, in the shape of carpet, chimney ornament, piano and guitar, which, if they do not of themselves secure the happiness of life, at least contribute somewhat to its good humour and content. But the circumstance which chiefly satisfied her on the night of their arrival, was the improved temper and cheerfulness of her father. While on the road he had exhibited a degree of querulousness and impatience which she had never perceived in him before the commencement of their present journey; and this temper was coupled with an air of precipitance and apprehension—a seeming distrust of all he met —a shrinking that looked like fear from all he encountered—which filled her own mind with apprehension, and made her at moments doubtful whether there was not something like mental alienation in him,—a suggestion of her fear which alone seemed sufficient to account for a course of conduct and manner, such as he had never shown to her before. These had worn away in great degree from the first moment after they had set their feet on their new threshold. The natural cheerfulness of the father seemed restored. He spoke soothingly and tenderly as if desirous to compensate his children for what they had been made to suffer in their journey; and the fond, pliant hearts of both responded to his cares, and grew glad in the return of those smiles of the parent which are the sweetest sunshine to the devoted and dutiful child. “Virginia, Louisa, my dear children,” he exclaimed, folding them in his arms as soon as the first cares and excitements of their arrival were over, and when they remained alone together in their little parlour—“we have reached our resting-place at last—henceforth, my dear children, this is to be your home. Lucchesa is one of the loveliest spots in Mississippi, and I have chosen one of the sweetest spots that surround Lucchesa. Here, Virginia, your rambles will be unimpeded and always beautiful; the woods are thick and various, and filled with the sweetest flowers; and you may now pursue your study of botany with more perfect self-approbation, since you will find abundant varieties of subjects to justify your love. And you, Louisa— what will you say to these little hills when you shall see them? They will seem to your eyes, which have never seen any but the dead flats of the low country, to be little less than mountains. Your feet will tire to ascend them at first, but after a little while, you will grow wild as a kid in your rambles —there will be no keeping you in.” “But, father,” said the child, drawing closer to the old man—“the woods are so wild and strange they frighten me—there's a strange noise among the big pines, and when I walk among them I hear sounds that seem like the voices of spirits.” “It is the wind, my child, that shakes the trees, and murmurs when it presses against them as if vexed at being arrested. You will grow used to that, until you learn to like it, as I doubt not your sister does already. What say you, Virginia?” A melancholy, spiritual smile, which passed over the lips and lightened in the eyes of the elder maiden for an instant, was his sufficient answer, and the father proceeded. “Our cottage is not one of the best in Lucchesa, but it was the best that I could buy. We will improve it as we can. You will see in the daylight that it lies on the side of a little depression that we low country people may almost call a valley. It is so low that you can only see it from the top of the hills; and the houses of Lucchesa can scarcely be seen at all from the top of ours. We have a little garden, Louisa, and you shall tend the flowers, while I raise the squashes and the potatoes and the cucumbers. Our gallery (piazza) runs round three sides of the house, the north only excepted; and though we lie in the valley, we have a sweet and extended prospect of hill-slopes on every side. The woods seem naturally to open into vistas, and these I will improve, until the cottage shall be the centre, from which an hundred avenues of sight shall diverge, and into which they shall gather from every point of the compass. But enough of plans for to-night. Louisa, your eyes grow heavy in spite of all I can tell you. Kiss me, my child, and then find out your chamber.” The child, drowsy, but still striving to be attentive, did as she was bidden. The elder sister was left alone with her father, whose mood grew less cheerful with the absence of the child, and whose manner became far less easy. For a few moments a silence that was painful to both succeeded her departure. Mr. Wilson rose from his seat and paced the room with emotions that were evidently oppressive. Twice, thrice, did his step falter and seem about to pause as he passed before his daughter, who, with head leaning upon her palm, seemed oppressed with emotions also, which, if not so exciting, were, perhaps, scarcely less oppressive than his. At length, as if overcoming a strong reluctance, the father stopped beside her, drew a chair, and taking her hand in his, addressed her as follows: “Virginia, my dear child, you have said nothing.” “Father, what should I say—what would you have me say?” replied the daughter, the cloudy sadness deepening on her lovely countenance. “That you repine not—that you are satisfied— that you are happy. See you not, my child, that the same paternal love which has striven so much to make you happy before, has spared nothing here within the compass of the country's resources to supply what you may have left behind?” “But wherefore are they left behind, my father? Wherefore have we left the home where the same pleasures, if you call them such, were already ours? Was there nothing in the old home to endear us to it—was it not endeared to us by the happy life we had lived in it—was it not endeared to us by the very death of her—that beloved mother—who made so much of the happiness we have lost— whose loss made so much dearer to us the little we had left?” “And was it not good reason that we should fly, my daughter, from a dwelling where we had known that loss?” “Alas, my father, it could not have been for that reason that you left our home—our home which death itself had seemed to sanctify. Years have passed since that cruel hour of parting, and the pang had passed away in the bitter memory of joys felt without a pang, and the assuring hope which was so cheering to us all, that she who suffered was now sainted beyond suffering. Oh, no! dearest father, my heart will not hear this reason—my mind cannot receive it. There must be another cause, and that cause, my father, is one which it doubly grieves me to believe, has made whiter than ever the hair upon your forehead.” “Virginia, my child, why will you press me thus?” cried the father, striding hastily along the floor with his hands clasped above his eyes, as if to shut from sight the mournful and inquiring expression of her countenance. “Because I am a child no longer,” was her reply, as, darting from her seat, she rushed towards him, and, catching one of his hands in both of hers, sunk upon her knees with a passionate manner which well accompanied the earnest and emphatic language which she employed, and which, while clinging to him, she continued to pour forth. “Because I am a child no longer—I am a woman grown—I can both think and feel. I can surely understand the sorrows that I still must share, and if I understand, my father, may I not help to relieve them? Were my dear mother living, I should look to her for the truth, when sorrow troubled and danger followed your footsteps; but in her absence I must take her place, and I implore—nay, I claim it as my right, my father—to know what grief, what threatening danger has driven us to this wilderness, where the forests are yet almost as wild as at their birth; where we have no society, and where we see no friends.” “And can it be for the absence of society—nay, can it be even for the loss of friends, when her father and her sister are still left her—that I hear these questions—that I witness this affliction of my daughter?” was the answer—an answer, the burden of which did not represent the real conviction in the father's mind, but which enabled him to evade the more searching inquiries which the first portion of her speech had conveyed. “No!” she exclaimed, rising to her feet, “as heaven is my help and hope, dear father, I answer `No!' It is not the little circle which I have left, nor the few friends for whom I had sympathy and attachment, that gives me cause of sorrow, however their loss may at moments occasion feelings of regret; nor is the wilderness into which we have wandered so uncongenial to my tastes and habits as to provoke inquietude and annoyance. I think not of these in the conviction that you are unhappy—that a secret cause of dread and danger hangs about you which makes you so often heedless of my love and indifferent to my endearments. Nay, shake not your head, my father—that smile does not deceive me. You require me to be happy, to be at ease, and find satisfaction and pleasure in the dwelling which you have found in Lucchesa, and the comforts which your customary care has gathered about us. I answer you that I will, so soon as I find that you derive pleasure and content from the same sources. Let me see you at ease, and you shall find me so; but while your brow is clouded—while your air and movements denote a secret apprehension of evil, I cannot but share the cloud upon your brow, and my apprehensions grow only the greater because I can neither see nor guard against the coming of the danger which you fear. Let me know all, my father. Give me the knowledge of this mystery— for there is mystery—and rely upon me to soothe your sorrows, though I may not avert their cause. Rely upon me to share those griefs with satisfaction which now bring me nothing but terror and despondency.” “You know not what you ask, my child!” cried the father, hoarsely. “What if I should answer? What if, foolishly persuaded by your entreaties, I should reveal the cause of my sorrow—nay, to silence you at once, what if my revelations brought you shame along with sorrow? Ha! do you shrink —do you tremble?—Would you still hear—Virginia, would you still listen to a narration of guilt, which would make your sorrow less endurable? Speak! shall I now relate what you have been so curious to hear?” “Guilt!” exclaimed the daughter, with feeble accents and a shrinking, sinking pain. “No! no! It cannot be—there is no guilt—there can be no shame. These are cruel words, my father; do not again speak them, I implore you—forgive me, forgive me—but you were so serious just now, when you spoke, that I almost believed you. Tell me your afflictions, but tell me not that there is guilt and shame, which, indeed, I well know there cannot be.” “Enough! Press me no further, Virginia,” continued the father, recovering his calmness in some degree, and, with some effort, smoothing the excited expression of those features, which, almost convulsed a moment before, had nearly convinced his daughter of the truth of the general confession he had made. “I trust that you will never know that guilt or shame could be coupled with your father's memory and image—” “And yet, my father, this change of name.” She spoke with tremulous accents, and a renewal of that look of shrinking apprehensiveness which denoted the bewildered state of her judgment, warring with her feelings and desires; unwilling to believe aught that could degrade or lessen the worth of one whom she was no less bound to venerate than willing to love, and yet the mystery of whose conduct left her VOL. II. 5 utterly doubtful in which direction to incline her faith. “Policy, my daughter, need have no association with either guilt or shame,” replied the father, evasively, and by a general remark, to which there could be no exception as such. “When I tell you,” he continued, “that the assumption of another name is necessary to my present interests, you are not to imply any thing dishonourable or unworthy in the change. There are motives which justify—there are reasons which make it necessary.” “Ah, my father, but there are no reasons which should make you deny your confidence to your daughter,” was the prompt reply. She, at once, seized upon the true and only point at issue between them, which she urged with as great a degree of earnestness as became the relationship between them. “I believe you that there are motives which require you to do this; but, surely, my dear father, you can neither deny my interest in a knowledge of these motives, nor my prudence in reserving them from exposure as carefully as yourself. Give to my love, dear father, that reliance which it has evermore given to you.” “You ask too much, Virginia; you are yet but a child to me. There are many things which are neither becoming nor necessary for a woman to know—which, indeed, she could not know—could not understand. It is enough that this is one of them —let me hear no more of this.” “Father!” “Nay, my child, I mean not to be stern—I would not be angry—but this is a point upon which you are too earnest—too much disposed to insist—of which you speak too frequently.” “It is only because it is a constant thought, my father—a painful thought—a doubt—a fear.” “Let it be so no longer, my child. Do you not see that I have grown cheerful since I have reached Lucchesa? You do not see me apprehensive now that we are in a place of safety.” “Safety!” was the natural exclamation. “And was the danger then so near us?” “Nay, how can you ask, Virginia, when but three days ago we all lay at the mercy of a gang of robbers?” A deep sigh escaped from the lips of the serious maiden, but she said nothing. She saw that her father strove to deceive her, and she forbore any farther reference to a topic which he was so anxious to exclude, even at the expense of truth. He saw her conjecture and sickened as he did so; but he could say little or nothing to remove it; and conscious of his feebleness in this respect, and in the inadequacy of any art or argument, short of a frank confession, to do away with her apprehensions, he resorted to the humbler policy of seeking to divert her mind by reference to other objects. With a general knowledge of the feminine nature, in certain minor respects, such as their love for petty pleasures, he strove to engage her mind in such matters as might amuse rather than employ it. But in this, he soon perceived, from the quiet indifference of her answers, that he must fail; and, tired of his task, and dissatisfied with himself, he forebore all farther effort, and the lateness of the hour soon furnished a sufficient reason for their separation for the evening. Virginia Wilson retired to her couch, but sleep was slow to visit her that night. Her heart was too much filled with the mysterious circumstances which hung around her father—her mind too much troubled with the apprehensions which had harassed him for several preceding weeks—to suffer the velvet-footed deity to approach her without warning, and to obtain facile possession, at an early hour, of his accustomed dominion. The night waned slowly, while a thousand thoughts and conjectures, chasing each other with as much rapidity, if not with as many startling transitions, as the images that flit over the magic glass of the wizard, made her mind a populous world, where all was commotion and much was strife. She thought, with unspeakable anguish, of the reserve of her father on those circumstances, evidently momentous, which had troubled him, and still troubled him, though, under their terrors, he had sought safety in a region still wild, and still the abode of so much that was barbarous. What were those circumstances?—and had he indeed found the safety which he admitted had been the object of his aim? These were questions that did not cease to afflict her, because she lacked all means for their solution. She could only hope and pray— she could only resolve to assume a cheerfulness which she could not feel, and to drive from her mind, by the acquisition of an early interest in the strange world to which she had been brought, that more grateful region to which she had been accustomed. This was, perhaps, the least of the mental difficulties in the way of Virginia Wilson. Hers was one of those commanding intellects that depend little upon the mere externals of society for their comforts and enjoyments—that make place and fortune subordinate considerations in an estimate of life's resources and rewards; and require peace of mind and confidence of heart in their own, and the purity of those with whom their lot is cast, rather than the praise of men or the plenty and profusion, which, to so large a portion of mankind, constitute the “be all” and the “end all” of existence. The wilderness had no terrors, but many charms; and to one who has seen quite as much of the superficial worthlessness and empty vanity of society, as of its harmony and grace, it was no difficult matter to find a charm in solitude which more than atoned for the fleeting pleasures she had lost. Under the care of such a mind as hers, and surveyed through the medium of such sweet affections as ministered around the altars of her unselfish heart, the wilderness could soon be made to blossom as the rose. But the dread of that nameless danger which followed the footsteps of her only living parent, haunted her thoughts with a continual presence. She estimated the powers of this danger from the terrors which had possessed her father's mind, and the very failure of conjecture to answer the doubts of her constant inquiry, was of itself a source of wo, which made her misery the greater. Still, it had never possessed her mind until the evening of her arrival in Lucchesa, and until the occurrence of that conversation with her father, a portion of which is briefly reported above, that there could be any shame or disgrace in connexion with the necessity which had driven him from his home. It will be remembered with what earnestness and pleading anguish she had exclaimed against the brief and passing suggestion of her father, that guilt and shame were coupled with his sorrows. This hint—though afterwards evaded and denied by Mr. Wilson, when he beheld the effects upon his child, to whom he did not dare communicate the truth—yet took possession of her mind, when the silence and secrecy of her chamber left her at liberty to re-examine the subject; and when she recurred to the secret and precautionary measures which her father had taken for his flight from Orleans—the indirectness of his course—the change of name—the constant apprehensions 5* which harassed him, making him as imbecile in resolution as they made him acute in observation—her fears, faint and shadowy at first, grew into distinctness, and acquired new bulk and body with every additional moment of reflection. She could now, and for the first time, readily conceive the motive for flight and fear, for that startling terror which at moments enfeebled his limbs and covered him with tremors—which made his voice sound hollow in his throat—which made his eye shrink to encounter even the fond and affectionate gaze of hers; and which, in the dialogue already briefly given, had moved him to those few but incoherent expressions, convulsively uttered, which could only have found their way to the lips of one labouring under insanity or guilt. That he was not insane she knew,—that he was guilty, the fear was rapidly growing into a faith within her mind. But of what was he guilty? Strange to say, the difficulty became as great as ever when she reached this stage of conjecture, or conviction; and, after a vain effort, by a reconsideration of all the subjects attending his movements from Orleans, to arrive at such hypotheses of the particular crime for which he fled, as would seem reasonable to her thought, she gave up the effort in sheer exhaustion, not without a lurking dread that, in a moment of passion, he might have stricken some enemy to the ground, and forfeited his own life in atonement for that of his fellow. Not for a single instant did she fancy that he had been faithless to his public trust—that he had incurred the scorn of all good men through a miserable appetite for gold. Still, though dismissing, as well as she might, the distresses of her father's situation from her thoughts, she found it difficult to win the slumbers that she wooed. Her mind had been too much excited by events and scenes which were new to the even and unbroken currents of her ordinary existence, to sink into quiet and leave her to repose; and the new world in which she found herself, and the circumstances, some of them exciting and startling enough, which had occurred on their journey, called for brief review. Some of these were like a dream—the flitting shadow of a disordered image, such as gathers before the eye of a drowsy fancy, and fills the mind with conflicting impressions. Yet there was one image that lay at the bottom of all others—which rose last to her survey, and lingered long after all the rest had departed—which was neither indistinct nor imperfect—which stood proudly and nobly before the eye of her imagination, and on the pure tablets of her memory—alone, unmixed with any other form or fancy—a controlling, commanding, imperial presence. This was the image of Vernon. She saw him once more as, bounding from the wood, he rushed forward without fear to the rescue of her father. She heard the clear, silvery accents of his voice, sweet, though stern, as he shouted to his companion to follow, and to the robbers as he pursued. She beheld the grace of all his movements, as, bending in the saddle, he passed the carriage at full speed in chase of the assailants, though already wounded; and a sudden tremor was renewed at her heart, as she remembered his faint accents when he returned, and when, sinking down before her in the road, he lay unconscious until they reached the dwelling of the Methodist, a noble specimen of manly grace and beauty. Not a single feature that her eye scanned at that moment, but rose to her memory with the distinctness of life; and, with a sentiment of fluttering pleasure at her heart, strangely mingled up with that sadness which is ever the companion of devoted love, she continued to muse upon the events connected with his presence, until thought subsided into sleep, and her dreams renewed, under various aspects of pain and pleasure, the images and events which she had been last reviewing.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER IV. “More particulars must justify my knowledge.” Cymbeline. Virginia rose the next morning with better spirits. Her “bosom's lord” sat somewhat lightlier upon its throne. Sleep had refreshed and strengthened her, and those dreams, those sweet, vague, twilight fancies that came so commended to her heart by their association with its own, as yet, unexpressed desires, had given a warmer glow to her cheek than it wore on the preceding evening. How soon youth relieves itself from the pressure and weight of most afflictions—with what elasticity it springs from the earth, and shakes off the dew and the despondency, and laughs aloud in the consciousness of a new birth, as it prepares, like the swift arising sun, to set forth on the glorious race of life. Sorrow to the young is only one of those shadows that momentarily cloud its skies. Wait but the morrow—nay, wait but a single hour,—and the cloud has passed away, the sun resumes his empire of light and laughter and universal dominion; the stars sing out a fresher song of rejoicing at the coming of the moon-browed night; and the recollection of storm passes away from the reviving spirit with the succeeding glories of every changing moment. True though it be, that memory may preserve the pain— nay, the pain itself may still lurk within the heart, —and yet, it is as a memory only—there is no venom in the wound. The pure of heart sooner than any other, relieve themselves from the heavier pressure of their burdens. Like Christian in Bunyan, every additional step, advancing up the hills of virtue, diminishes the weight of that bundle which the best of us are still compelled to carry. The cheerfulness of the maiden was increased as she found an improvement in her father's mood and bearing. He had resumed the old smiles which he was accustomed to wear in those more palmy days of the heart to all parties, when fortune smiled upon his household, and indiscretion had not as yet prepared the way for guilt. The gloomy humours, which had made contact with him for the last few weeks unpleasant, even to a daughter so dutiful as Virginia, were seemingly all dissipated; and before breakfast was well over, the resumption of old aspects in the little family, gradually had the effect of softening what was strange, and providing what was deficient, in their place of forest retreat. The cares of the new household—the work of order— occupied the morning, and employment is a choice morality, as it promotes content. The furniture was to be arranged; the pictures to be hung; the curtains raised; the carpets laid, and a thousand little matters to be attended to, which employed all parties, and prevented that brooding gnawing thought, which is quite as frequently the growth of the body's idleness as of the mind's activity. Then, there was the little garden to be looked at, and plans were to be hit upon for disposing of its solid squares, and cutting into angles, crescents, stars and circles, its dead and uniform levels. To survey the little farm in its whole extent, was the business of an hour, and dinner time approached with a rapidity which was unaccountable to all. After dinner the carriage was prepared for a drive about the environs of Lucchesa, and in a better mood for appreciating the beauty of rural objects than she had been for weeks before, Virginia took her seat in the airy vehicle, from which the travelling top had been removed, and prepared, with the more easily delighted Louisa, to see all the charms of scenery of which her father's taste and previous knowledge of the region, made him a very able cicerone. We have already afforded to the reader a brief and passing glimpse of Lucchesa, on the approach of Vernon to that lovely village. It will not surely be supposed necessary that we should endeavour to dilate upon this portion of our labours: since, with a few small and partial exceptions, most country villages have the same general outlines. Yet, as we have said before, Lucchesa was a village among a thousand, and stood almost alone in many respects among most of the little villages of Mississippi. The general aspects of a social settlement in countries purely agricultural, are seldom very pleasing. The proprietors of the land are better pleased to centre around themselves, on their own plantations, their resources and attractions. These persons seldom dwell in communities, and villages are, accordingly, with few exceptions, given up to such only as ply the arts of trade, and subserve, in some central spot, the wants and wishes of a populous surrounding country. As this surrounding country is thickly or sparsely settled,—as it is rich or poor—will be the moral and social characteristics of the village which looks to it for support. The occupants are usually such as need has driven. They are not often natives of the neighbourhood for which they toil; and until very lately, but few tradesmen were known in the southern country, who did not “hail from” New England or New York. The exceptions to this general rule were, perhaps, the blacksmith or the wheelwright. The Yankee adventurer is seldom a labourer. He is a trader, a tavernkeeper, a tailor, a pedler—he will do any thing that will enable him to avoid those heavier toils that call for great muscular activity and power. He is a jobber, a contriver, a calculator, an inventor—one of that cunning class, which, like the fox, takes good care always to employ another's fingers to draw his nuts out of the fire. It demanded brief time for our party to see the whole extent of the little settlement; and this done, as the afternoon was only half spent, the ride was prolonged by a short ramble in the neighbouring country. They had but a little while returned from this ride before they were apprised by a talkative African, who was employed as a sort of gardener, of the events which had taken place at the tavern— the arrest of Vernon—his supposed attempt to escape, and the injuries which he received from the officers in consequence. The tale did not lose in the usual exaggerations, nor was it quite so briefly narrated as it appears in this passage. It might be easy for us to let Cudjo speak for himself, as it is so favourite a custom with so many of our authors to make the negro a conspicuous actor in their scenes; and we see no good reason why a negro who speaks better English, and wears breeches, should not be quite as decent a personage in a modern novel, as a naked Highlander. Besides, Cudjo was an actor, and his animated gestures and fitting action might be a very good lesson to many of more pretension and a less imposing colour, who have greater rights and make more use of them to the great annoyance of deliberative assemblies. He commenced his story with a serious bluster; something like the manner of a northwester in its first approaches. The restraints, self-imposed upon his manner at first, were only intended to heighten the Kean-like outbreaks toward the close. He was, according to the prevailing rules among the stagestricken heroes, simply reserving his powers for the fifth act—and when he reached the part where he proceeded to show the conflict between Vernon and the officers—when he described their joint rush upon him and the descending blow of the Irishman's shillelah—he did it with such terrific truth, that Virginia screamed aloud, and Mr. Wilson, grasping the arm of the negro, demanded to know if the youth was killed. But to this question he could obtain no satisfactory answer. Cudjo knew, indeed, well enough, but like a prudent narrator, he drew the curtain over the scene at that point when the doubt was most oppressive. He knew no more—he would tell no more—but confined himself, when more particularly examined, to simple reiterations of the part into which he had studiously thrown his greatest powers; and the renewal of which no persuasion could move him to forego. He knew his strong ground, and was resolved to make the most of it; the more particularly when he found that he had acquired, as well from the burden of his story as from his manner of telling it, a fearful interest in the eyes of his young mistress. The agitation and alarm of Virginia Wilson were great, but natural enough; and while her father stood looking with equal surprise and indecision upon the reiterated gestures of the slave which were made to supply those breaks in his story where his language was imperfect or incomprehensible, she clasped his arm, motioned his dismissal of the negro, and proceeded, though trembling with emotions of no ordinary character, VOL. II. 6 to remind him of the duties which lay before him. “You must seek this gentleman, my father. He has saved us in a moment of great danger, at the peril of his own life. You can only atone for the seeming indifference with which you left him, sick and wounded at Mr. Badger's, by attending to him now.” “How attending to him, Virginia? I am no doctor.” “Oh, sir!—O, my father!” “Yes—I don't see, Virginia, what we are to do.” “Oh, sir, but you cannot help seeing. He is at this tavern—you know not in what condition. If he be seriously hurt you must provide the physician, and bring him to your house.” “What, here, my child?” “Yes, sir, here. What can the sick man expect of comfort in a public tavern—in one where he can have no attendance?” “And what attendance can he have here, Virginia, more than from a physician?” “Your attendance—mine—Louisa's—the attendance of a private family having more comforts at command, and acknowledging a debt of gratitude to this youth, whose weakness, and sickness, and injuries may all arise from the very part which he took in our rescue. He is charged with murder, and what murder can it be but that of the man whom he killed in preserving us? It is your duty to preserve, and to succour, and to defend him. Your evidence, alone, may save him from the punishment of that deed, for the justification of which no one can offer better proof than yourself. Go to him, my father, bring him to your own house, and see to his injuries. Our utmost pains will scarcely acquit us of the deep debt of gratitude we owe him, and for which we could not even before bestow our thanks.” We have seen the result of this interview between the reluctant father, and the resolute and well-minded daughter. She gained her object, though not without finding considerable difficulty in the coldness and the fears of the conscious criminal. The very name of a sheriff's officer distressed him—the idea of absolute personal contact with them filled him with apprehensions, and when Virginia suggested the probable importance of his testimony in the youth's defence, the image of the keen-eyed magistrate looking into his own secret soul, re-awakened the terrors which beset him on his flight. But the maiden's mind was too firmly impressed with the conviction of what was due by her father for himself and his children to the daring stranger, and she was too happy, even in spite of the youth's sufferings, that the chance was afforded them to remove the impression from his mind, that they—perhaps, if the truth were properly written, it would read she— had been ungrateful, in so speedily flying from one who had done them such good service, without speaking their acknowledgments—may, without ministering to those hurts which he had suffered in their defence. And yet, when her father had departed on his mission of humanity, her heart began to tremble with some new misgivings. Had she not been too urgent in this business—had she not over-stepped the nice boundaries of maidenly modesty in pressing for the admission of this young man into her father's dwelling? Might not the tavern be as good as any other place for his recovery—as full of aids and comforts? And, again, what if he were not a gentleman? A man might be brave and generous enough to risk his own life for the succour of a stranger, yet lack all those more estimable points of character, which would entitle him to the freedom of a family—to an entrée into its sacred retreats—to a seat beside its hearth—to the ministering cares of its daughters. But such was not the case with Vernon. Her convictions fought earnestly against this suggestion. Her arguments were such as, naturally enough, rise uppermost in the mind of the young, the beautiful, the amiable, and true. He was himself young, and his face, distinguished by the clear skin and features of a nice symmetry, wore an expression too unequivocally noble and manly, even while his eyes were closed in the swooning fit which had overcome him during their brief ride to the house of Badger, to suffer her to suppose him wanting in those advantages of birth, education, and a proper taste and character, with which her hoping fancy had already endowed him. He, too, must be true and amiable, and with this satisfactory conclusion to her thoughts and doubts, it was still surprising to herself why her heart should so flutter and beat, when she listened to her father's narrative after his return, and when she knew that the youth was already an inmate of the house. But the agitation of her heart passed away when she was informed of his condition—when she learned that his hurts rendered it necessary that he should be kept in a state of the utmost quiet, lest the delirium which had already shown itself partially in his words and actions, should be increased to an extent which might baffle the powers of medicine. It was then that she became the woman—that she threw off the enfeebling apprehensions and fancies of the girl, and following her father to the chamber of the patient prepared to assist in the labours of the nurse. The position in which Virginia found herself was an intoxicating one. The strong man whose gallantry had saved her father and herself, lay before her, an unconscious dependent. To her feeble strength and whispered will, he could oppose neither strength nor will. She could look upon his pale face and the subdued and silent features, without challenging a returning glance. She could hear the feeble moan and incoherent sentence that fell from his lips and without being startled by a single consciousness of the exquisite delicacy of her own position. While he lay helpless and delirious, her emotions were all of that serene order which belong to the undisturbed performance of a single duty. There was nothing to alarm her sensibilities—nothing to make her look too narrowly into the propriety of her position, or the seeming tenderness of that regard which she persuaded herself, was the due of gratitude—of humanity—any thing, in short, but the ministrations of love. The affections of women are usually unselfish. They love the more profoundly the more they serve. Their love grows with their labours—with their toil for the beloved—and, the idea of all injustice or oppression excluded, their passion is proportionately increased by their cares. To be allowed to serve, is with them to love the object of their devotion. It is for man to show himself grateful for the service; this, perhaps, in the warmth of their devoted homage, is the utmost that they ask. Yet, even when this acknowledgment is withheld, the greater number of them will still continue the service. The service itself, to the dependent spirit, is a joy; and they will ask little more than the vine that only prays the privilege to be suffered to cling around the tree. Perhaps the heart of the woman who has once loved, will only cease to love when it is denied to cling and to entwine itself. Even when there is no returning caress, the sufferance of love will still be a sweet privilege to the very dependent spirit. How many are there who enjoy no 6* more than this—how many more are there who merit, much more than man, that unceasing homage which they are only suffered to bestow! It might have been that Virginia Wilson would have soon forgotten Vernon, had they not a second time encountered. Love is not a thing of first sight, though first impressions, confirmed by a subsequent knowledge of the object, will very commonly ripen into love. However favourable had been the impressions made upon Virginia by the appearance of the handsome stranger, changing scenes, objects, and circumstances, must soon have erased them, or subdued the vivid colours in which they were first made. But the cares of tendance upon the sick-bed of the youth—the deep and difficult respiration of his breast, labouring under the fever which assailed him—his languid but incoherent utterance—the occasional moan and whisper which escaped his lips, and those broken words which had a meaning she would have given worlds to understand—these were all circumstances which, as they denoted his dependance upon her, increased her interest in him; and no hours were more sweet during the time of his illness than those in which she was suffered to watch beside his couch. But the crisis was soon over—a few days effected a favourable change—the returning consciousness of the patient, in freeing her from her attendance, deprived her of the sweet privilege which his situation had afforded; and the languid eyes of Vernon looked round him vainly and impatiently for that lovely countenance of which he had some sweet and partial glimpses in the intervals of his disease. In place of these he encountered no forms more interesting than those of Mr. Wilson, or the little Louisa, or the sturdy Alabamian, or the more wily Saxon, the outlaw—both of these last being necessarily admitted to visit at the house of Wilson, as friends of the invalid. As Vernon grew better, his anxieties at his situation were renewed He felt the difficulties in crease of declaring his true character, as the agent of justice, to his hospitable entertainer; and the annoying character of this feeling was not a little heightened as he looked upon the bewitching grace, and encountered the timid glances of his lovely daughter. There was another circumstance that also afflicted him. He could not mistake the interest with which the keen eyes of Saxon followed the movements of Virginia Wilson; nor suppress the involuntary pang with which he listened to the language of the outlaw, subdued, conciliatory, yet free and graceful, which he held with her. Saxon, too, sometimes enjoyed a privilege, which, in his feeble state, was necessarily denied to him. He could attend her in those afternoon walks, when the sun, sinking behind the forests, left only a few glimmering tokens of his light to soften the scene, and beguile the musing and melancholy spirit into groves, which, shady, sweet, and solitary, seemed more than all other scenes beside, to harmonize kindred spirits, and bring them into a more near communion with each other. Vernon, he knew not why himself, felt uneasy at these rambles. Not that they were frequent. Had he been a just as well as a close observer, he would have discovered that, on those evenings when Saxon returned with the maiden from her walk, she always came back at a much earlier hour, and her reserve was no less obvious than the obtrusive attention of her companion. Could he have been permitted a glance at them in their rambles, he would have been as much struck with the cold courtesy of her tones in replying to her companion, and the evident unwillingness which she displayed to receive those thousand little attentions which are so apt, where the parties incline to each other, to sweeten the dull ramble, and shorten the prolonged paths of the forest. But Vernon already watched all things with eyes readily disposed to see them through a false medium, and a spirit that conjectured the worst of all things which it is not permitted to see. His inability to share in the rambles of the maiden necessarily increased his apprehensions of the more fortunate person who happened to be her companion; and his distrust of the outlaw, which had been a sort of instinct, making him reluctant to assimilate with that person from the first, was now heightened to a feeling of positive dislike, as he contemplated the superior advantages which he possessed, and dreaded the events which might spring out of them. Assuming that the attentions of Saxon were as grateful to Virginia as they seemed imposing in his own eyes, he suffered his annoyance to show itself, sometimes, in a cold glance and colder speech to the maiden herself, at moments when the jealous fit was particularly active in his bosom; and it was only by a strong and resolute exercise of that manly sense, which was the prevailing characteristic of his mind, that he could see, and seek to repair by an immediate change of deportment, the brutality of which he felt himself guilty. On such occasions her eyes would sink to the floor—her voice, which had urged its inquiry in a tremulous tone that might have conveyed a grateful meaning to the heart of any lover, not blinded and made obtuse by other and perverse feelings, would become silent; and she would seize an early opportunity to retire from the eyes of all, and in the solitude of her chamber pore over those mysterious emotions which oppressed her, without remedy; and wonder at the excitement in her heart, for which she felt unable to account. Why had the words of Vernon such power over her? Why did she shrink from his gentler glances —why did she suffer at his cold ones? Why was it such a pleasure to hear that voice, the sounds of which yet made her tremble? It was not long before circumstances provided her with a reply. Meanwhile, Vernon improved hourly, and the attendance of the physician ceased to be necessary. The hour was approaching when the officers of the law would claim their prisoner, though this conviction was productive of more disquietude in his mind because of the pleasant communion which it was destined to disturb, than because of any danger in which his arrest promised to involve him. That he should be seriously made to answer for the death of Horsey, he did not suffer himself to think for an instant; yet, he did not, because of his confidence in himself, neglect those duties, the performance of which arose out of his present situation. He prepared letters to his friend and patron, Carter, giving a succinct detail of his wanderings and adventures, up to the very moment of his writing, omitting no event which might be held worthy of communication, excepting such details as belonged to the conferences which he had had with Badger and Rawlins on the subject of the banded robbers of the country. On this head he deemed it prudent to forbear all remark in a letter which was to be entrusted to the ordinary post; particularly, indeed, as Carter was not greatly interested in any such matters. With respect to the fate of Horsey, he related all that had reached him and all that he knew—detailed the chief particulars of their dialogues where they threw any light upon the purposes or course of that erratic youth, described the circumstances under which they parted, and, after relating the affair of young Mabry, and the assault of the latter upon himself, suggested a surmise—which he would yet have willingly foreborne—that this young man himself might have been the murderer; for the probabilities strongly inclined to this opinion. “I know,” he continued—“I know, my dear sir, that you will not need my solemn assurance,—which I yet make—that my hands are utterly guiltless of this young man's death. I trust to make this appear in my examination before the justice, and I am scarcely less anxious that you should do your best to convince his worthy old parents to the same effect. Next to the pain of this most humiliating situation in which I find myself, is the deep sorrow which I should ever feel at incurring, however unjustly, the suspicions of the good people whose kindness to me was not the less grateful to my heart, because it was comparatively unimportant to my interests. I must pray you then to spare no effort, by an array of all the favourable facts which you possess, and a careful display of those arguments which you understand as well as myself, and which conclusively establish the folly and impolicy of such a deed, to acquit me, in their eyes, of the cruel imputation. I write,” he continued, “from the house of William Maitland, himself, with whose family I have been an inmate for the last five days. I am in part indebted to his hospitable care for my improved health and recovery from my hurts. As yet he knows nothing of me, of my connexion with you, or of my objects. My developement of the latter, in such a manner as to effect your generous intentions towards his children—both of whom are females— and to escape the reproach of requiting good with evil, shall be my study between this and the period, when, in compliance with the demands of the officers of justice, I shall be compelled to leave him. My position is one of considerable delicacy, and my course, therefore, must be the result of a calm and serious consideration.” Such was a portion of the elaborate letter which Vernon prepared for the persual of his guardian. Could it be imputed as insincerity, or an improper suppression of necessary particulars, that the writer said not a word more on the subject of those children of Ellen Taylor, in whom Carter had such a prevailing interest and to whom he was disposed to exhibit a degree of generosity no less novel than extreme? Vernon's own conscience smote him for the suppression of particulars which he knew must interest his patron to know; but he strove in vain to overcome a reluctance, the sources of which he was unwilling to examine. He was yet writing, when he heard the fall of a light footstep passing through the gallery. He knew the step—and he hurried to the window with a movement, which, in his feeble state, it required some effort to make. His eyes followed the slowly moving form—the form of perfect symmetry—the movement of perfect grace. Her course lay through the garden to the shrouding woods beyond it. This was her accustomed walk. He forgot himself while he gazed—his thoughts were steeped in the dews of a most elysian fancy—his worship was oblivious of all other objects than the one of its adoration. On a sudden she looked behind her—she looked upward—their eyes encountered, and then she fled— fled even as the young fawn, that, wandering forth from the forest for a single instant, and for the first time—in that single instant, encounters the glance of the hunter.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER V. “Well, perform it, The law is satisfied: they can but die.” The Old Law. A new spirit rose in his bosom as he beheld this movement. “Why should I not pursue?” was the involuntary self-inquiry of his mind. He grew stronger as he proposed it. The stiffness of his wounded limb seemed to lessen, and grasping the staff with which he had been wont to hobble across his chamber in the last two days, he moved forward with a degree of rapidity that was scarcely justified by prudence. Unseen, he passed through the gallery, descended the steps, followed the lightly-beaten footpath which he had seen her take around the garden, and was soon hidden in the same forests which yet concealed her from his sight. A new thought entered his mind at this moment. A keen pang of jealousy thrilled through his heart. “What if I intrude upon a sacred privacy? Goes she not to meet this smiling fellow—this Saxon—this pleasing wordmonger? Walk they not together daily? Wherefore should I approach them?” Had the question been answered by his reason merely, he would most probably have returned to the dwelling without farther search. But he remembered the backward glance which she gave him—her sudden flight, and that memory, which answered nothing and told nothing, had yet a signification of more effect upon his heart than all the arguments of his mind to his understanding. He went forward, and she had neither fled so far nor so fast, but that he was able to overtake her. She sat upon a fallen pine—one that the hurricane had but lately wrested from its foundation, the foliage yet green upon its branches. The long leaves hung around, and half-shrouded her from his sight. Him she saw not, but remained in her sitting posture, unconscious of his approach, until he was within a few paces of her. Then she started to her feet—then he beheld that face—those eyes once more turned upon him, and he fancied they had been glistening with tears. But this might have been a fancy only—what need had she to weep? He saw no tears, and dismissed the suspicion from his mind; but he could not doubt that her cheeks were more pale than usual, and the languid brightness of her eyes—their dewy softness—could not be mistaken. There were certainly some keen sensibilities at work within her bosom. He was moved instinctively by this conviction—he felt that there were some weaknesses in his own, but he strove to silence and put down that ever ready consciousness which is so apt, in every young man's bosom, to convert into his special divinity the first passable damsel whom he sees. Vernon was a youth of calm, good sense, and he was determined to keep his emotions of blood and fancy from having their own way. He assumed a lightness and gayety of tone when he addressed her, which called for an effort. He took her hand, re-conducted her to her seat, and placed himself beside her while he spoke. “Give me joy, Miss Wilson, that I am at last able to find out your favourite walks. I caught a glimpse VOL. II. 7 of you from the window, and grew strong to pursue, as I beheld the ease of your flight. I have long envied you these walks,—let me make you my acknowledgments, since it is, perhaps, owing to your friendly cares that I am so soon able to enjoy them.” “Not to mine—not to mine,” was her hasty reply. “I have done but little, Mr. Vernon—I am very happy that any thing that we could do should have been agreeable to one to whom we owe so much. You—” “Ah! you would remind me of a happy moment —but you need not; I am too proud of having served you, however slightly, to forget my own good deeds. I may not boast of them, but I need no help to persuade me to remember them; they will always form a part of that pleasant chronicle, Miss Wilson, which the heart makes of its fortunate events. I shall set them all down together with the five days enjoyed in your cottage.” “Enjoyed, Mr. Vernon?” was the smiling question. “Endured, you mean.” “No, enjoyed,” was the answer. “The pain of the illness is soon forgotten in the cares of the nurse; and the kindness which has soothed is always a pleasure to be remembered, even when the pain is forgotten. Let me say, then, how sweet to me is the obligation of gratitude which I feel to you and yours, for the pleasant cares which have ministered to my feebleness and need.” “Do not speak of it, Mr. Vernon. My father has only done his duty. But for you, we know not what might have happened to us. You saved us at the hazard of your life, and what we have done called for no hazard.” “But much trouble—much annoyance—” “No, no! Mr. Vernon—it was a pleasure, sir— to—” She paused—the jealousy of a nice maiden delicacy became apprehensive that her gratitude might express itself too warmly. Gratitude she knew was justified, but that had its own language, and the caution was only a proper one, lest she might employ for its expression the language of a warmer sentiment. Perhaps Vernon detected something of this consciousness, for he put his hand upon hers with a gentle effort to detain it in his grasp, as he said, hurriedly— “Speak, Miss Wilson—go on.” She withdrew her hand—the flush was renewed upon her face, but she said nothing. A moment followed of awkward silence to them both, which was only broken by a strong and decided effort on the part of Vernon. His lively manner had utterly departed in the first few moments of their interview, and it was with a gravity natural on many accounts to his situation that he renewed the conversation. “Next,” he said, “to my acknowledgments for your hospitality and kindness, Miss Wilson, is the desire which I feel to place myself in a right point of view before you. I would seek to assure and convince you that your kindness has not been bestowed upon a criminal, though I have no proof beyond my own asseveration, by which to convince you that I am utterly guiltless of this murder which is laid to my charge.” “Oh, think not, Mr. Vernon, that we believe— that we can believe this foolish charge—I am sure —I know that it is groundless.” “On my honour, you do me only justice. The shedding of blood—the taking of life—is an offence against humanity from which my soul would shrink, unless in a case of absolute necessity. The only deed of the kind of which I have ever been guilty is one that took place almost in your sight, and was strictly justifiable from the circumstances preceding it.” “Yes—yes!” faltered the maiden, with a shudder. “The young man for whose death I have been summoned to answer, was one of whom I knew but little—nothing unfavourable—but on the contrary, much which commanded my indulgence and regard. I had neither quarrel to maintain against him, nor interest to pursue; and my own objects, Miss Wilson, were of a nature which made me particularly desirous to avoid all strife and difficulty with any and every body. That I have not been able to avoid them, is due rather to my evil fortune than my desire. I know nothing of the grounds upon which this charge has been made against me, or of the parties making it, but I trust soon, Miss Wilson, to satisfy the judge of that innocence which you have so kindly declared yourself willing to believe.” “Oh, sir, we know—we hope it will be so. I am sure there can be no doubt of it. My father says he is certain you will be released, and Mr. Jamison told me but yesterday that you no more committed the crime than he did, and he will soon enough convince the justice to that effect. He is very friendly to you, sir, that Mr. Jamison.” “A good fellow—a strange fellow, whom I never saw before the evening of my arrival at Lucchesa; but, like the frank men of our western forests generally, he carries his heart in one hand and his weapon in the other, always and equally ready whether for friend or foe. I hope he may not be too sanguine in this matter—I rely rather upon my own consciousness of innocence than upon any knowledge of the facts with which I am acquainted. I know nothing of the circumstances upon which the accusation is based.” “Nor does he, I imagine; at least, he could tell father nothing, who was very anxious to know. His convictions in your favour seemed to arise from his prepossessions; you are fortunate, Mr. Vernon, in finding friends so readily—perhaps that fact alone may be considered a presumption in your defence.” “I am afraid it would go but a little way to my acquittal; but then it can be nothing but a presumption against me, and a presumption, unsupported by strong circumstances, can do me little harm. And yet, Miss Wilson, there is something in your opinion which carries to my mind a hope scarce less grateful than would be the assurance of my easy escape from this cruel imputation.” “What is that, sir?” she asked, innocently. The question would have been left unspoken had she looked up in his face when she replied, and beheld the increasing brightness and piercing regard, contained in his glance. “That you found nothing strange or wonderful —nothing unnatural or unexpected—in the supposed facility with which I have secured the favouring prepossessions of others. May I hope that he who has won the friendship of the rude countryman, will not be thought too presuming if he fancies that he has also not vainly striven for that of the city maiden? Your friendship, Miss Wilson, would be that of beauty and youth, and education—taste without artifice—opinion without rudeness, and intellectual strength mingled with grace and sentiment. May I hope for these—may I dream, in the vanity of a too sanguine spirit, that in finding these qualities in you, and estimating them at their true value when found, I have not prayed in vain for the acquisition of your regards. Your friendship—” He paused—the sentence remained unfinished, though its purport was no less clear to her mind than it was in the mind of him who yet withheld its 7* utterance. It may be added, that she felt how much more grateful it was, left unspoken, than if it had been concluded. Vernon himself felt that it could not be concluded as it then stood. It was too cold a projected termination to matter that was naturally rising into warmth, and a manner already warm and beginning to be impassioned. He wisely stopped short—short where he was—and she breathed less freely under the pressure of a sentiment which was strangely sweet, though almost suffocating. And he—the glow upon his cheek made itself felt—the tremors at his heart grew almost to a murmur like the swift dropping of distant falling rain. Was it, indeed, friendship that he solicited from the favouring estimate of Virginia Wilson? At that moment neither of them thought of friendship,—they thought of any thing beside. The sympathy was of a stronger sort which was stirring in the bosom of the two, and it found its proper utterance at last. But let us abridge the scene. Love passages are rarely of interest to third parties; and either glide into the bright fantastics, such as glow in the ethereal world and season of a Romeo, or become, in the measured economy of the modern calculator, a question of portion, pin-money and proper establishment. In either case, the reader or speculator yawns in weariness or disgust, and is satisfied with those results which tend to a final dismissal of all the parties. We might hope—we certainly should pray— for a better interest with these. Vernon was no lovesick fantastic, though warmed by a temperament never subdued, not always measured, and sometimes endowed with no limited tongue for utterance; but his passions were perhaps more governable than those of most young men, and he had gone through a long course of severe self-study, by which they had not only been regulated to a certain movement, but his reason had also been advanced to a certain supremacy. This self-acquired power kept his utterance within the bounds of good taste and propriety—his love was that of the man and the gentleman—his passions were those of civilization. He had learned to know that blood frequently presumes in the language of affection, and becomes obtrusive because of a selfishness which it disguises by another name,—he also knew that the first lesson which true love has ever taught, is one of humility— but that humility which is always allied to hope. Love is the religion of the passions, and its zeal, though warm and fiery, is still that of one officiating at high altars, where the first sign of the advent of the god is shown by the submission of the worshipper. By gradual transitions—by the one mystic key-note— the look, the word, which, here and there, suggests the stages by which two hearts, having the same journey to take, are gradually brought together—an interest grew up in the breast of each, leading to a just comprehension of the other; and ere the one spoke, the other felt. Vernon, to his own surprise, discovered that he had won a heart long before he ever dreamed of looking for one; and Virginia Wilson— certainly, until she met with our hero, she had never thought it worth while to take any care of that, which she now discovered it to be so seriously sweet a business to surrender. Though we have denied ourselves the pleasure of beholding the love scene and hearkening to the love dialogue between the parties, there was another who, “squat like a toad” in the cover of the neighbouring foliage, had no such scruples as restrain us. He heard and witnessed all. This was the outlaw Saxon. He had followed their footsteps, and had penetrated to a spot which would enable him to arrive at a knowledge as vexing to his spirit as was the manner degrading by which it was obtained. He heard, with ill-suppressed fury, the whispered word, half doubt, half tenderness—he saw the smile which trembled in the eye it lightened—the gentle meeting of those mingling hands, which, under Love's slightest pressure, become instincts themselves and of the most sensitive character;— and no less new than bitter was the pang that went through his own breast, as he beheld the happiness he envied. He had only of late grown conscious of a passion such as he had never felt before. He had sought Virginia Wilson daily from the first hour that her presence had shone upon his sight; and under the pretence of an interest in his wounded fellow-traveller, he had obtained access to her dwelling with the purpose of pressing those attentions by which he hoped to secure an interest in her heart. He had joined her in her daily walks—was not without that easy dialogue and graceful manner which are of all things most essential to success with women; and had striven with his best powers to commend himself to her regards. Yet she had shrunk from his pursuit; had discouraged the intimacy at which he aimed—had responded coldly to his conversation, and shown herself more than commonly obtuse whenever he had striven to be more than commonly intelligible. Yet, here was one, who, almost without his own consciousness— certainly, without design—had succeeded in that which had tasked his utmost ability under the guidance of a settled purpose and a deliberate scheme. The mortification of his pride increased the pang of his disappointment, and the vindictive determination with which he had before regarded Vernon, now assumed a deeper character in his mind. “It is well,” was his thought, as he surveyed the pair—“but the hour of vengeance is at hand. You would bind the outlaw, Harry Vernon! We shall see. Artful, and strong, and sagacious, as you think yourself, you are in the toils. Deceived by one traitor, Clement Foster will scarcely suffer himself, hand and foot, to be manacled by another. Pliant once, he is now unyielding; and by all that is sacred in the love of the saint and the fear of the sinner, you shall pay the penalty of your presumption by your life. You would hunt the bear in his native brake, beware of his embrace.” He left the place of his concealment with a stealthy step, and without disturbing the lovers, who were now but too much absorbed with one another to have senses for the rustling branches, or the slight motion of a gliding form among the leaves. He proceeded to the tavern with all the impatience of hate and summoned his confederates, who played the part of the officers of justice. To them he issued his commands, and described the place in which the lovers were still to be found. “Seek him there,” said the vindictive outlaw; “and seize on him at once. Give him no indulgence —drag him away, though you find him in her arms. Hear none of his promises—hearken to none of her entreaties. The scoundrel is a spy upon us—another Hurdis; and he deserves no mercy at our hands. Away! you know the place.” He saw them depart in the same instant, and waited with malicious impatience, the result of his previous mandate. The lovers meanwhile had prepared to return to the cottage. They were already on their way—the hand of the maiden in that of Vernon's; her eyes cast upon the ground as she listened to those accents so dear to the young heart —those idle words and whispers, which, though they sound sillily enough in the ears of third persons, seem to the initiate more precious than manna in the wilderness. At this moment they were encountered by the ruffians who stood suddenly in the path before them. Virginia shrunk back in alarm, while a faint scream issued from her lips. “How now, fellows! What mean you?” demanded Vernon, who did not at first recognise them. “Fellows! indeed!” said one. “We'll see who's the better fellow when Judge Nawls sets eyes upon us. That's for being civil to you, I suppose, and letting you off when we had you. But there's an end to that. You must go along with us.” “Along with you! Who are you?” “Oh, you've no memory of us. I shouldn't be surprised if you've forgot yourself too. You're not Mr. Harry Vernon, that killed one Thomas Horsey, and we aint the men that 'Squire Nawls sent to catch you. Come, come, young 'un, that's not doing the thing handsomely—that's not keeping to your promise. You must go along with us at once, so drop the young lady's arm, and here's our'n. It aint quite so soft a one, it's true, but, by the hokey, it's better able to help you, and then you know, need must when the devil drives—so no grumbling.” The action of the ruffian corresponded with his words. His hand was already extended toward the collar of Vernon's coat, when, stepping back a pace, the indignant youth lifted his staff with a promptness and determination which drove the fellow back much faster than he had advanced. In another instant, however, a calmer mood filled the mind of Vernon. “This is all idle. I certainly do not mean to resist these men—I have no reason to fear the magistrate.” Such were his thoughts as he turned to Virginia. “Miss Wilson, forgive me. I am giving you a needless alarm. These are the officers of justice, and seeing me well enough to travel, they naturally enough seek to perform their duty. Will you proceed to the house?—I will follow you. I would speak with them awhile.” He led her forward until they had passed the officers, then left her to proceed alone while he returned to them. “Gentlemen, I will be ready to go with you in an hour;—I will but return to the dwelling of Mr. Wilson, and at the end of that time will meet you at the tavern.” “Twont do, my boy,” was the answer, “you're too ready with your stick to be trusted. You must go with us now. We can't trust you out of our sight.” The youth would have expostulated, but while he spoke one of the ruffians threw himself upon him, bore him to the earth, and, in spite of all his assurances that he would quietly accompany them, proceeded to bind his arms with a cord which the providence of Saxon had procured for the purpose, and which the assistance of his companion enabled him to use in spite of the angry but feeble resistance of the prisoner. When bound, they lifted him to his feet, and placing themselves, one on each hand, commanded him to move forward in the direction of the tavern. He did so with as much quietness of temper as he could command under the reasonable anger which naturally followed the provocation. He tried to convince himself that they were doing nothing more than their duty—that they had yielded him all reasonable indulgence; and were bound, as soon as they discovered his ability to travel, to secure his person against the chances of escape. But the sedative effect of his own reasonings was very partial. He still could not resist the wish that his arms were once more free, and his staff once more in his hands. “My staff should make ye skip,” thought he, in the language of the “Ancient Mariner.” But he overcame a desire which he felt to be no less idle than hopeless, and tried to obtain his remedy in another way. “A civil answer turneth away wrath,” and he had long known that a civil tongue will carry a man unscotched through the whole western country. Assuming the men beside him to be no other than what they professed to be, he determined to reason with them as persons who could have no motive for refusing any indulgence to a prisoner which was not inconsistent with the security of their trust. “You are unnecessarily hard with me, men,” he said quietly. “You can have no reason for thinking I would run away, since, if such had been my desire, I could have been off at daylight, and none had been the wiser. Why then would you make an enemy of a man who can be your friend—who is willing to reward you? Suffer me to go back to the dwelling of Mr. Wilson for an hour only. You, in the meantime, can watch the dwelling on all sides. My horse is at the tavern—you can secure him, and without a horse I cannot fly very far. I wish but to make my acknowledgments to the family which has treated me with so much kindness.” “You ought t' have done all that before, my lark —there's no time for you now. So set forward. I tell you there's no trusting you. You clipped me over my noddle already, the first day I set hands on you, and my jaw isn't quite smooth yet; and you forget, just a bit ago, you'd have tried it again with that stout hickory that helped you forward. Twice warned is enough for me—I don't risk a third scuffle with any man if I can help it. So, look you, give but a single flirt again, and here's into you.” The fellow showed a monstrous bowie-knife as he spoke these words, and by his reckless expression of countenance, suited to his bold and unfeeling language, Vernon readily believed that his better policy was to obey quietly. He went forward, and encountered the hardy Alabamian, Jamison, who was just about setting out for Wilson's, on his customary afternoon visit to his friend. Saxon was nowhere to be seen. Nothing could exceed the rage of the Alabamian, as he witnessed the degrading situation in which his friend stood. He was at once for fighting the officers, and nothing but the most earnest appeals from Vernon kept him from violence. One thing, however, he was resolved to do, and in this particular our hero was satisfied he should have his own way—that was to cut the cords which bound the arms of the prisoner. He drew his knife for the purpose, and was advancing, when the constables both opposed him with like weapons. But he was not to be intimidated by this show of valour. “There's two of you,” he said, “but I count myself good for three, at least, such slender chaps as you; so here goes at your kidneys, and one drive of my six pounder will let more sins out of your carcasses than all the saints could ever put in virtues.” With an earnestness which left nothing to conjecture, the stout-hearted Alabamian, wielding his knife in air,—a huge, bright instrument, with a back-bone like that of a butcher's cleaver, so heavy that its own weight, if falling, must have made its wounds deadly—prepared to rush forward upon the constables. But these worthies were not willing to wait for such an encounter. Receding from their posts, they clamoured to the bystanders for protection, crying out a “rescue”—a “rescue.” Without heeding their clamour, or suffering any thing to divert him from his purpose until it was finished, Jamison cut the cords of the prisoner, and seizing VOL. II. 8 the moment when the officers were most noisy and most remote, he whispered in his ear— “Be off now, Harry Vernon—there's my own horse hitched close beside you, and I'll keep off the rascals while you're mounting. Show 'em clean heels, and I'll be after you with your own nag, and will join you at Buzzard Roost in two hours. They're afraid of me, the niggers, and you see I aint afraid of them. D—n 'em, I don't mind half-a-dozen of them, fair front and no dodging. So go ahead, my boy, and leave the scatteration to me. You're too weak to fight now, so there's no reason or right to expect it of you.” The Alabamian was astounded when Vernon thanked him, but declared he had no purpose of the kind. “I am innocent of the charge, Mr. Jamison, and do not fear to meet it.” “Oh, well! That's right enough; but guilty or innocent, you see, Harry, when they're for putting ropes on a freeman, that's a time to be off, or to fight with tiger's tusk. I'm all grinders after that, and a ridge saw that works along the middle.” Meanwhile the clamours of the constables were gathering a crowd about them. “He has cut the prisoner loose—the man that murdered Tom Horsey—help!—seize!—catch the murderer,” &amp;c. “Shut up, you yelping pugnose!” cried the indignant Alabamian, “and none of your d—d lies about a business you can't understand. Look you, men, they had the gentleman corded up as if he had been a panther of the wilderness—roped his hands behind him,—and he just out of a sick bed, and making no resistance, and telling them all the while he was ready to go along with 'em. It's only they're sich blasted cowards, afraid of a sick man—afraid of any man. Dang my buttons, I'm almost ashamed I didn't borrow a pen-knife to do the business. This bowie-blade is a'most too big for such etarnal small souls as they've got.” “You hear him confess he drew his knife upon us?” said one of the officers to the crowd. “Ay,” said Jamison, “and how it scared the niggers white when they saw it.” “He rescued the prisoner from us.” “A lie, nigger—he's at your service—he says it himself—so bring out his horse; and I'll tell you another thing—I'm at your service too. I'll ride along with you and see fair play, and if you've got any thing to say agin Dick Jamison, let it out as loud as you please when you stand before the judge.” The scene ended with the quiet departure of Vernon, accompanied by his friend Jamison, under the enforced escort of the officers.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER VI. Caliban. Lo, how he mocks me! wilt thou let him, my lord?Trinculo. Lord, quoth he!—that a monster should be such a natural! The Tempest. Having now fairly lodged Vernon for the murder of Horsey, it is high time that we should retrace our steps and look into the progress of the latter important personage. Though somewhat baffled in his hope of having a companion, in a kindred spirit, to the end of his journey, the stage-struck hero was not without his consolation in the moment of the parting from his friend. He was on his way to the scene of action—another day would bring him to the place where the wandering tribe was to be found, for whose communion he panted even as the hart panteth after the water brooks; and visions of theatric glory began to gather on his eyes. With that restlessness of imagination which betrayed itself in every thing which he said and did, he was already fancying himself in the midst of such difficulties, arising from bad management and the laboured rivalry of inferior persons, as were really grateful to a man of his temperament. His cogitations, which broke forth at moments into rabid soliloquy, were most generally of this description. Now he laughed at the idea of Jim Tilton and Hugh Peters, and the ridiculous figures which they must cut as Brutus and Julius Cæsar; at the next moment, he was soliciting their applause for some new reading with which he contemplated to astound the natives and improve Shakspeare. Anon he went back to the cottage of Yarbers, and his visions, then, were of Mary Stinson as the most perfect Juliet that ever stimulated the best capacities of a Montague; and as that fancy worked in his mind, his voice grew more emphatic, and a spectator in the bushes might have been no less surprised than amused to have heard and seen him as he rode, declaiming at the full pitch of his lungs to Juliet in the balcony, and at moments, in the earnestness of his action, almost flinging himself from the ungainly and venerable steed of his sire, whose neck he sometimes embraced, by a very natural error of his imagination which confounded it with the form of Juliet, or Mary Stinson rather, who, in such moments, seemed brought immediately within his reach. In this manner, with a mind far away, in a province utterly foreign to that through which his only half-conscious person travelled, he went forward without interruption, and was only brought back to the actual condition of things around him when he reached the river, and the grim Charon of that stygian stream, leading his horse through bog and sluice, contrived, with some difficulty and after no little delay, to place the two fairly in his boat. Some time was consumed in conveying him across, for the river swamp, in the day of which we write, was one of the most interminable intricacies that ever distressed a good steed or vexed an impatient traveller. But the delay did not so much affect the actor. He soon made a companion of the boatman—a simple, stupid fellow, who scarcely comprehended five of all the words that were said to him, and answered none. But Horsey needed no answer—his only object was an auditor, 8* and he was sufficiently satisfied, if suffered to talk on without stint or limit, though the hearer made no response to any of the questions which he asked. These were neither few nor unimportant; but as the actor did not wait for an answer, why should we? He was soon, comparatively speaking, set across the river; but the thousand hollows of the swamp, filled with the waters of a recent freshet, were around his path, leaving it at moments doubtful in what direction he should pursue his way. But Tom Horsey was not the man to suffer himself to be bewildered long. His mind soon ran off in the direction of his desires, and looking rather to the end of his journey than to his course, he gave himself not much concern about the way which led to it. After a few moments of reluctant attention, in which it seemed to his eyes that all his efforts only led his hobbling horse from one sluice into another, he soon forgot every thing but the one subject most at his heart; and if his allegiance wavered for an instant, it was, perhaps, in regard to an exception which might be considered, indeed, only an auxiliar to the other—namely, the person of Mary Stinson, and she as Juliet. With a mind thus directed, he had no attention to bestow upon the external world around him, and did not seem to heed, or be conscious of the fact, that the day was approaching to its close—and that so far from nearing the cottage where he proposed to spend the night; he had, in fact, utterly departed from every thing like a road, his horse slowly toiling forward through Indian footpaths that deepened occasionally into the cart or wagon width, but only at places where the presence of bog or creek suggested the best of reasons why they should do so, and not because they had ever been employed by any such vehicles. But, utterly absorbed in his own speculations, none of these signs were perceptible to the actor, and night would have come upon and caught him in the swamp before he would have been conscious of his predicament; but for the sudden appearance upon his path of one, whose wild and uncouth exterior and abrupt entree, were of too startling a character to pass without regard. The stranger was a chunky little imp, not more than four feet high; wearing a bunch upon his shoulder, which at first glance, suggested to Horsey the idea of a native born Richard. His arms were long like those of an ape; his ears of corresponding dimensions; his lips, pursed into a point like two bits of shrivelled coonskin, were covered with a thick furze, not unlike that of the hair upon the same animal; and with a short pug-like nose, and little, quick, staring gray eyes, that peeped out from under a shaggy white pent house of hair—he presented altogether the most comical appearance that could be imagined, and one that would have made the fortune of a cunning showman in any of the Atlantic cities. His legs, though short, were strangely bowed —indeed, the extreme curve which they described was one cause of their shortness. He might have risen to five fair feet, could they have been smoothed out symmetrically. As he went forward, which he did with a readiness that occasioned surprise in the spectator, the bow of the advanced leg would completely overlap the other, so that he would seem, to the passing glance, in possession of one only. His garb contributed something to his comical appearance. He wore tights, as pantaloons, which showed to a nicety the attenuated size of the crooked limbs on which he depended for support. He seemed almost entirely without flesh. The lower limbs were not merely short and deformed, but slender to a degree which made the spectator apprehensive that they might snap as readily as pipe stems under the swollen and dropsical bulk of body which they carried. But this show was deceptive. The urchin had an elasticity of muscle, a capacity of stretch and endurance in his sinews, and a share of positive strength in his excessive breadth of shoulders, which made him little inferior in conflict to most ordinary men; and in speed he could have outwinded the best. A little jacket of green bombasin, made on a plan quite as narrow and contracted as the breeches, rendered the hump singularly conspicuous upon his shoulders; and by contracting these somewhat too closely, served to throw the long and apish arms out from the body in such a manner as greatly to increase the similitude between the owner and the ungainly animal to which we have likened him. A coonskin cap, set rather jauntily on his cocoanut-shaped head, and tied under his chin with a green riband, completed this parody on man, who, leaping suddenly out of a green bush in the middle of a mud puddle, that lay beside the path, proved a more startling object of terror to the horse of the actor, than of surprise to himself. The animal sunk back on his haunches with a snort of terror; and, with a greater show of muscle and spirit than he had deigned to vouchsafe since he had begun the journey from Raymond, he was for wheeling about in good earnest, and making fleeter back tracks than he had ever made before. But that Horsey was a born rider, like every other western man, he had been soused for a season in any one of the hundred miry habitations of frog, hog and alligator, which so thickly garnished the low territory around him. Meanwhile the little urchin stood upright, or as nearly upright as he could, in the narrow pathway, never making the slightest movement to budge or assist the rider, but grinning with a smile of satisfaction at every wheel and flirt of the still frightened animal, which promised to fling his rider into the ditch. The unassisted efforts of Horsey, however, managed to evade these attempts, and at length, finally succeeded in subduing the spirit—no difficult task—even if he did not so soon quiet the terrors of “old dot-and-go-one.” Shaking his finger at the dwarf as he forced the horse forward, the actor exclaimed with a degree of good nature, which probably arose from the consciousness that his good horsemanship had not been without a spectator,— and which, had he not been the conqueror in the strife, would not have been so apparent— “Ah, you comical little fellow! How you scared my horse!” “And you too, if the truth was known, Mr.,” was the unhesitating reply of the urchin. “I'm a man mighty apt to scare people that's not used to me.” “Gad! there's reason in what you say!” exclaimed the actor. “But look you, my pretty little Jack of Clubs, suppose I had been a sour-tempered fellow instead of what I am, what would I be doing at this time, and what sort of speech would you be making? Wouldn't I be using a hickory upon your shoulders, my lad, for scaring my horse, and—” “His rider!” The urchin finished the sentence after his own fashion. “Ha! ha! ha!” The woods rang with his yelling laughter—a peal more strange and unnatural than any thing in his shape. “Ha! ha! ha! Mr. Traveller—more easy said than done. If the thing were tried, it might be your shoulders and my hickory; and if you think otherwise, why, you can only begin the business as soon as you please.” “Say you so, you little apology for a man—you little cock-a-doodle-doo—I'm almost tempted to try odds with you for the fun of it, for riding by one's self makes one rather dull, and the fun that turns up by the roadside is always apt to be the funniest. Wait a bit, then, till I can cut a hickory.” And the actor made a show of dismounting as he spoke. “Boo! boo!” cried the little urchin with a yell, as, leaping from the path, he ran along a fallen tree, slippery with mire, that rose out of the ooze of the swamp and stretched away into a canebrake, in the midst of whose tops the dwarf squatted himself down, and grinned, and laughed, and pointed with his finger at the assailant, confident that he could not so easily be approached by an unpractised footman, and secure of a second means of flight, in the branches of a tupola hanging above him into which a customary leap would easily carry him. “Ah! ha!” exclaimed Horsey, “there you are; and you think yourself safe, do you, but what do you think of that, my little mannikin, eh?” He pointed a pistol upward as he spoke, but the derisive laugh of the dwarf mocked this exhibition, as he in turn produced from his breast a like weapon, the dimensions of which would have swallowed up those of his assailant. “Ha! ha! and what do you think of that?” said the urchin. “It's snout for snout—and the advantage is all o' my side as yet.” “How do you make that out, you pretty little deformity?” demanded the actor, in good-natured accents, amused rather than annoyed by the readiness of the urchin. “Well, it's easy enough, and you might see for yourself,” replied the other; “I'm rather the littlest man of the two, but I have the biggest pistol— you're the biggest man with the littlest pistol. Aint my chance the best to hit, you big fellow—aint it now? Suppose we try—that's the best way to come at it—you may bang away first, for all the good it's going to do you.” “Come down, you small specimen of humanity— you youngest son of the little old gentleman in black,” said the actor, with a hearty good humour that satisfied the dwarf there was nothing more to fear. “Come down, you queer little coxcomb, and let's hear all about you. You are certainly the strangest sniggering little scamp, that I've seen in all my travels. You'd make a most superb fellow on the stage—a witch in Macbeth—no!—'Gad, maybe you're one of us already.” “Maybe I am, maybe I'm not!” said the dwarf with a grin as he descended. “Who are you—can you bite?” “Bite!” “Yes, bite—have you got teeth to bite, or are you nothing but a barking dog?” “Teeth to bite—barking dog!—why you talk as queerly as you look, my little Richard.” “Richard! Why, who told you my name?” “What! your name is Richard then?” “Yes, with a pair of scales to the end of it—you couldn't guess that, I reckon?” “No! I don't know what you mean.” “I'll tell you—my name is Richard Stillyards, or Dick Stillyards—sometimes they call me Dick Still, and sometimes Dick Yards, and then it's only when I'm in the humour that I answer them. I always answer gentlemen when they call me by my right name.” This was said with a manner which filled Horsey with merriment, and would have filled a wiser man with sadness. The swagger, the solemn strut with which it was accompanied, and the air of superiority with which the narrow and protrusive chin was perked forward, had in it so much of a rotund self-conceit, that never was that foible of humanity so completely be-mocked and be-devilled. “Why, what is there to laugh at, I wonder?” said the dwarf, in tones and with a manner of more real dignity, though with an equally ludicrous effort. “Hark ye, Stillyards, my dear fellow,” cried the good-natured Horsey, “let us shake hands. You're a d—d comical little fellow, Stillyards, and we must jog on together. I'll make your fortune, Stillyards; by the powers, you shall grow famous—you shall. Don't you grin, my boy, I'm telling you nothing but the truth. You shall grow famous and make your fortune. You shall be one of us—and I'll undertake your tuition. By the ghost of David, Stillyards, I'll find you a dozen characters in Shakspeare alone which could not be done by any body half so well as yourself. You have read Shakspeare, Stillyards, have you not?” “Read!” said the dwarf, with something like a sinking of his dignity. “Well, stranger, to say the truth, reading aint my business, though, I suppose, I could larn just as soon as any body else. There's a nigger of Joe Smith's, named Peter—his young misses taught him to read in a short six months only, and he can now read write-hand 'most as good as print. I'm sure if I had any chance, I could larn as quick as Peter.” “Devil a doubt, Dicky, that you might, but who's to learn you, unless you could persuade the same young lady that taught Peter to give you a few lessons?” “Why, didn't you say you'd larn me?” said Richard Stillyards, with a grin of satisfaction that caused a considerable encroachment of his mouth upon the territory usually conceded to cheeks and ears. “To speak and act, you terrapin, and not to read,” was the reply. “Look you, stranger, if it's the length of my teeth you want to know, call me out of my name,” replied the urchin, with a grave air of offended dignity. “You're not the first man that's lost flesh between my jaws for making too free; so it's jist as well you should know it beforehand. I know I'm a little smaller than you, and maybe not quite so good-looking, but that's neither here nor there, and I don't mind the difference of size no more, when I feel wolfish, no more than I'd mind a dog-bark in a seedy night. I axed you a question jist now, and didn't get an answer.” “What was that, Mr. Richard Stillyards?” demanded Horsey, with an air of respectful deference, exceedingly delighted with the strange monster he had encountered, and disposed, with a true actor's fondness for fun, to humour the weakness which betrayed itself so ludicrously. “What was it, Mr. Richard?—speak again, and don't imagine for an instant that I am at all desirous to fill your jaws with my flesh, as I cannot say with certainty that I have any to spare—certainly none to spare, unless you are willing to take it just where I give you leave. I could give you a bite in one place or in another, and not miss it, perhaps, but it's likely you'd be choosing for yourself. Eh?” The literal manner in which Horsey had chosen to accept the coarse figurative language which the urchin had employed was, in western parlance, “a huckleberry above his persimmon;” and Mr. Richard Stillyards began to regard his companion as an animal no less strange to him than he appeared to Horsey. After a brief space, which he devoted in silence to a jealous survey of those features, which, by this time, the actor had schooled into inflexibility, VOL. II. 9 he replied, as if satisfied with his examination— “I was a-thinking at first, stranger, that you was a-funning with me, but I believe it's only because you don't know no better. I'm a country gentleman in these parts, and have company camping out in the woods, here away, down by the corner of Little Bend in the Cane Prairie—every fellow's a man among 'em, all barking dogs—and so I axed you about your teeth.” “My teeth?” “Yes, your teeth,” replied the deformed curiosity; “aint you got teeth? Can't you bite?” The actor surveyed him with intentness, and the result of his examination, as he beheld the bona fide earnestness in the fellow's face, was to convince him that Richard Stillyards was an idiot—a conclusion which, no doubt, has been already reached by the reader. But let him not be mistaken. Dick was no idiot, but a cunning owl that hoots with a greater drawl of melancholy when most meditating mischief. He had his purposes in the question that seemed so excessively simple to his companion, and was answered satisfactorily when he received no answer. “Dick, my lad, you're a strange fellow. To ask a man whose teeth have been opening upon you every moment since we have met, if he has any!” “Oh, no harm, mister—I don't mean any harm— to be sure, I see you have got teeth, and I oughtn't to ask, but it's a way I've got; but you're a-travelling only?” and here the urchin gave a keen, quick glance to the corpulent saddle-bags, filled to the brim with knight, prince, warrior, and tyrant, which hung from the saddle of the actor. In a second instant his eye was averted, as he beheld that of the traveller fixed upon him. “Dick, my boy,” said Horsey, “you're a nut for the devil to crack, for d—me if I can. To be sure I'm a traveller, just as certainly as I've got teeth; and now that you remind me, I'd like to know where I'm travelling, and how far I may be from a place of lodging?” “Why, don't you know?” “Devil a bit.” “What! you don't know where you're a-travelling? I reckon you knew when you begun?” “Why, yes! That I did, but look you, many a man sets out for the horse and finds the halter. I started for Benton.” “Benton?” “Yes, Benton. How far am I from the house of one Jenks Glover?” “Jenks Glover! Why, he's on the lower road— a matter of sixteen miles to the left of you. You've got on the wrong track.” “The devil you say!” “No! I say the wrong track; it's you that said `the devil,' three times, or maybe more, and it's no wonder you lost the road. You must have lost it after the first jump at the ferry.” “And it's how far to Benton?” “Mush! I can't tell you—it's on the other road, and a smart round about chance to get to it.” This news confounded our traveller. He shrugged his shoulders, and looked round him upon the dismal, dark, and seemingly impenetrable swamp, the pale cypresses of which shot up sparingly, with the tupola and the ash, to gigantic heights, interlaced between with a complete wall of matted canes, briars, and wild thorny vines, that promised to defy even the rude pressure of the grisly bear, or his more good-natured sable brother. The prospect made the actor shudder. “Dick, my boy,” he said, “whose is the nearest house, and how far?” “There aint no house on this road, that I knows of, and nobody.” “`If that thy speech be sooth!”' the actor began, after the nature within him; but the dogged stare of the dwarf warned him that his companion suffered nothing equivocal, and he resumed in plain English: “No house, Richard—no house, my dear fellow?— Why, what am I to do—where am I to sleep to-night?” A grin diffused itself from ear to ear upon the fellow's countenance, as he listened to the words and beheld the visible consternation of the actor. He seemed disposed to amuse himself at the expense of the traveller. “I reckon you aint used to sleeping out of the dry. You were born, maybe, in a nice house, with a close roof to it?” “Ay, to be sure, and in a devilish comfortable bed too, I reckon; but what then, Dicky, my darling?” “It's a bad chance you'll have for a dry house here in Big Black Swamp; there's no better house than Cane Castle, and it's so large you can't see the walls, and it's so high you can't see the roof; and if you aint used to the stars for candles, you'll have to go to bed in the dark. There's no house near by, and only one under ten miles, and that's 'Squire Nawls'—and he's a judge, and don't take in travellers.” “But he lives on the Benton road.” “No he don't. I reckon he's on the upper road, a smart distance from it. As for road—you're in no road at all here—you're in Big Black Swamp, and if your nose was long enough, you could smell the river at a short mile off, on your right. If you was used to the smell, you could smell it here without going much farther. I can, easy enough,”—snuffing, while he spoke, with consummate complaisance— “and a mighty sweet smell it has, too, just after the sun's gone down.” “You're an amateur, Mr. Richard.” “No, d—d if I am, and I tell you agin, stranger, 'twont do to call me by any nickname. I'm Mr. Richard Stillyards, or Dick Stillyards, and I won't go by any other, so I warn you before danger.” “Well, Dick, my dear fellow, I'll be civil—the fact is, I'm in no humour for making enemies. But tell me where I am to sleep to-night—where shall I get a bed?” “I licked Ike Laidler only a month ago, 'cause he called me a little circumstance,” continued the deformed. “And sufficient provocation too,” said the actor; “but, Mr. Stillyards, the bed—the bed—the house to sleep in.” “Well, now, stranger, you're mighty pushing. Ha'n't I told you there's no house under ten miles—” “Then you told a whopper, Dick Toady,” cried a third person, suddenly emerging from the bushes on the left, and interrupting the dwarf without any of that scrupulous consideration upon which he was so much disposed to insist in his conversation with Horsey. The stranger was a small man, with a narrow sunburnt face, a hook nose, and lively twinkling gray eyes, that seemed to cover a world of cunning. His voice was good-humoured, and at the first sound of it the dwarf started with an air of dissatisfaction, which did not seem to justify the free and familiar manner with which the new-comer had addressed him. “How should you tell the gentleman, Toady, that there's no house nearer than Judge Nawls'?” “Well, where's any?” 9* “Why, here, you blue bottle, here in Cane Castle, hard by, within a Choctaw's mile. When the stranger asks for a house, what does he mean but a place where he can take his snooze out without danger and disturbance. He don't mean wall of clay and clapboards—he means nothing more than a good supper and an easy sleep. Am I right, stranger?” Horsey, somewhat relieved of the annoying conviction that he must sleep in a canebrake with the soft ooze of a rank swamp in place of a mattress, was yet not utterly satisfied that this description of his desire was altogether a correct one. Still, there seemed little choice, and the free buoyant manner of the stranger was too much after his own heart not to reconcile him to things even more disagreeable than those he feared. He was consoled to find that if he must sleep in the swamp, he was to have a good bedfellow—a conviction which had not soothed him for an instant during his whole protracted conversation with Mr. Richard Stillyards. He expressed his assent to the suggestion of the speaker, though in a qualified measure, but this the other did not seem to perceive. He proceeded in his speech in a manner still more agreeable to the traveller. “We are a few of us, stranger, almost playing gipsy in the swamp to save expense. There's some six or eight of us, Today here not being counted, though he may be thrown in as a sort of makeweight. We sleep pretty much in a huddle, under pole and bush tents, and there's room for an odd one when the river's foul and the swamp rises. We are players—play-actors—perhaps you don't quite know what a player is?—the people in these parts look on us with as much wonder as pleasure—we play plays —speak speeches—show tricks, dance and sing, for the public gratification and our own. We shall soon set out for Benton, Lexington, Lucchesa, and other villages—soon as the rest of the boys come in—and if you'll keep in the neighbourhood till then, you'll see rare sport, I tell you.” The effect of this speech upon Horsey may readily be conjectured. His ejaculations of pleasure interrupted the speaker a dozen times before he had finished, and then he grasped his hand with a hearty tug that threatened to shake his arm off. He forgot his cares of bed and lodging and supper— all cares—all doubts—all apprehensions—in the one predominant pleasure that filled his soul; and a hundred questions and ejaculations followed each other too rapidly for correction or reply, as he gave free vent to those emotions which he had so long and so unwillingly restrained. “And you belong to little Jim Tilton's company? And where's Jim?—I knew the little fellow in New Orleans, when he was—a-hem!” He was about to say candle-snuffer, but a little prudence came to his aid at the moment, and put an estopel on his tongue. “Jim Tilton,” said the other, “is no go. He's but a poor drab, and the less we say of him the better. He's not with us now, and I seriously doubt whether he'll ever show his face among us. It'll be a dark day for him when he does.” “Ha! how so? how so?” “Well, he's a rogue—that's the long and short of it. We played at Manchester to a good smart chance of a house, and before the play was over, Jim was missing, and the treasury with him. We heard of him going down to the river to Vicksburg, and that's the last. He won't come back, unless he brings a double chance of picayunes to make up hush-money.” “The skunk! But it's like him,” said Horsey. “He was a poor shote of a fellow at Orleans, a mere candle-snuffer for C—well, when I was playing second-rates at the American.” “You playing—you! Why, who are you?” said the new-comer, with a very natural expression of surprise. “My name is Horsey,” replied our traveller, with a modest dropping of the voice. “Horsey!—Not the famous actor at Ludlow's in Mobile? It can't be possible. Tell me, stranger?” The gusto with which this was spoken—the voluminous odour which it bore up into the mental nostrils of Horsey, was as good as a year's growth—a prize in the lottery—or a crowning benefit. His blood tingled in his veins from head to foot, yet never did mortal face struggle more hard to subdue the exulting smile—to assume and wear the pursed up aspect of humility. “I was at Ludlow's,” he replied, modestly, “and I don't know that there was any actor there but myself of my name; but I was not famous—no, no! I did some good things—I think I did—but they passed without notice. I do not think I got much reputation in Mobile.” “My dear sir, you do the Mobilians injustice— great injustice. I have heard of you a thousand times in Mobile, and from the best authorities. R—a thought you a first-rate. R—a was an excellent judge in theatricals—my particular friend—a noble fellow, and there was—what's his name?—the editor of the Commercial—ah! devil take it, I have such a memory. But it matters not. I tell you, Horsey, never did dramatic reputation stand higher in Mobile than did yours. You were off for New Orleans when I reached the city, but every body was asking after you, and on one occasion it was reported you had arrived but had no engagement, and then there was a hue and cry after the manager. It was asked in all the papers why you were not engaged, and he was compelled to assure the audience, under the terrors of an uproar, that you should be engaged as soon as your arrival was made known to him. I was present at the time, and know the stir it made.” “Is it possible? I wonder I never heard of it before.” “I reckon you didn't read the newspapers. It was all there—all put down as large as life. Nay, if you were in Orleans, you must have heard of it.” “No,—indeed I didn't. I never read the newspapers. I took a dislike to editors. I thought them all humbugs—they spoke very disrespectfully of me at my first beginning, and I was resolved never to read their stuff. But I was wrong: I suspect—” “Wrong! Yes, that you were! You have shut your ears against some pleasant truths. If they treated you ill at first, they made you ample amends afterwards, as I think I can show you. I have, I think, some of the Mobile Patriot of that time that'll open your eyes. Newspapers and editors, Mr. Horsey, should not be looked down upon with too much contempt. They are useful in their way. They may be made so at least; and, between us, it's best to treat the humblest profession with charity, since, if our managers continue this trick of running away with the strong box, there's no telling to what condition we may be reduced.” “Very true! But what could be expected of such a fellow as Tilton. I was astonished when I heard that he had presumed to set up for a manager.” “What! you heard of us then?” “Yes—I heard of you down in Raymond, and my purpose was to join you.” “Join us! God bless you, Mr. Horsey. It'll be the making of us,” said the stranger, grasping Horsey's hand and flaming out with the opening in Richard— “`Now is the winter of our discontent Made glorious summer by the son of York.”' “That was well spoken, Mr.—ah! pardon me,— but oblige me with your name.” “Jones!—a humble one, sir, utterly unknown to fame!” replied the other with a great show of modesty. “It may be, Mr. Jones,” replied Horsey, warmly; “but those two lines which you have just now spoken were really well said—very prettily said— excellently well said. I shall look for good things from you. Indeed, I shall.” The flatteries of the stranger had seduced the judgment of Horsey into a corresponding flexibility, and in a few moments, the apprehensions of the traveller were all forgotten in the exultation and resuscitated hopes of the actor. The anxieties natural to his situation, and which, but a moment before, had grown almost painful, were dismissed entirely from his mind, and in a moment he had resumed all the characteristics of manner and feeling, which he had shown to our readers on his first introduction. He now spoke, ad libitum, of plays and playing only. Every third word was a quotation; and it was only when the new-comer, who had kept up the ball with no little show of practice and ability, found his corresponding store of quotation utterly exhausted, that he was brought back to the more immediate necessities of his situation. It was now the turn of Jones to remind him of his lodgings for the night. But it was not so easy now to direct the attention of our actor, who, once aroused on his favourite theme, would wag a tongue in its honour so long as the member itself had a single working hinge to depend upon. “But we forget, Mr. Horsey,” said Jones, in prosecuting his often baffled purpose—“we actors, who so love our profession, are very apt to forget other matters. Here we are, wasting our readings upon the desert air, when we should be thinking upon other matters. Supper now and a place to sleep in —I must crave your pardon for keeping you from these things so long.” “Nay, these are small matters. The toast and tankard can be got at any moment, but for the rest —what of my old Prince of Hickories? What of Hugh Peters, and how are his timbers? He to make a Julius Cæsar! Ha! ha! ha! The thing's ridiculous, Jones; and he must be got rid of as well as Tilton—birds of a feather—no game—fellows that will disgrace us only. Crows, crows!” “Very true, sir—I agree with you fully, but—” “Oh, to be sure, I know there will be a difficulty about it;—it will be unkind to drive the fellow off and hurt his feelings; though d—n his impudence, he deserves no better for presuming on such a vocation. Why, Jones, I remember even now the comical figure the old fool used to cut in giving us lessons in reading. Even then, when I was a mere brat of a boy and knew little or nothing, I could scarce keep my face to see him mouthing out the golden verses of the great master. He'd get up on a box for a stage—his bow legs at a straddle, as if a ditch lay between 'em, for the better support of his bag-of-cotton body; and then he'd turn his little turnippy pugnose, fairly affronting the heavens, and his lips sinking deep at every sentence that he spoke, in the hollows where his teeth were knocked out just in front,—he got it done one dark night as he fell over a wash tub, and composed himself among the stumps of a new clearing. The hole was large enough for my finger,—and he to be an actor? Ha! ha! ha! It's ridiculous—we must get rid of him; though, to be sure, as you say, we must do it in such a way as not to hurt the poor devil's feelings. By the ghost of David, though I should remember Little Bowlegs only by his hickories, yet I'm for doing it tenderly. We must smooth the track for him so that he may walk off freely. But go he must if we hope to do any thing. He'd be only in the way —he can do nothing.” “Yes, to be sure—you're perfectly right, Mr. Horsey, and the management might very well be put into your hands. I'm sure we might make our monster Dick here do every thing that Peters might do; but, as I was saying—” “What, Stillyards!” exclaimed Horsey, turning upon the attentive dwarf, who stood, all the while the dialogue proceeded, wondering, with owlet eyes and broad distended mouth, swallowing the incomprehensible stuff that he never could digest. “Look you, Jones, that fellow's a host himself. I wouldn't give my friend Dick here for all the Peters under the sun. He's the most comical fellow! What a Caliban he'd make—a natural born Caliban. Egad! we had a scene between us just before you came up—a scene for a melo-drame—it was worth a picayune to see it. He ran up that tree like an ourangoutang; drew out his barker, squatted on his haunches, with the felicity and grace of a black bear at a honey gum, and challenged me to a regular exchange of shots. The comical fellow—he's worth a company himself; and in New York—look ye, Jones, after all, New York's the place—on the Bowery, that fellow as Caliban would be a sure card, and we must play him when we play ourselves.” “We must talk of this to-morrow,” exclaimed Jones, desperately,—and seizing upon the only pause which Horsey had made for an inconceivably long time. “I will send Dick forward to get things in readiness for us—supper and a bed. Ho! Dick! let the boys know that the great actor, Mr. Horsey, is coming with me. Away, by the gulleys, while we ride round. We'll be with them in a half hour.” The urchin prepared to obey. “But why not go along with Caliban?” demanded Horsey. “For the best of reasons. He can go where our horses cannot. On a line we are but a poor quarter of a mile from our camp ground, it will be a good half hour's ride to reach it the way we must travel, and night will swallow up the track before we are done. We must ride, therefore, to make up lost time. I was so pleasantly occupied, Mr. Horsey, in listening for the last half hour, that I never saw that the sun had left us. You must give our boys some lessons to-night as soon as supper's over.” “Ah, Jones, you flatter,” said our friend, modestly; “I am no such man as you think me. You can do the thing quite as well as myself.” “No, no!” replied the other, with something of a mournful tone, as he rode forward—“No, no! that is not to be hoped for. Would to heaven it were!” Horsey followed with a new feeling of delight within his bosom. The tone of the cunning Jones, the words he employed, not to speak of the prospects and promises of ultimate and unqualified triumph before him, were all so much heavenly manna to the still hungering vanity of his heart; and never before, in all his career, when the possession of money, lavishly squandered, secured him the VOL. II. 10 clamouring applauses of the profligate associates who misled him, had he received a more grateful tribute to his ruling desire than that afforded by an adroit outlaw of the Mississippi border. He followed his guide without suspicion, and was soon swallowed up from sight in the darkness that now environed the dense swamps of the Loosa-Chitta.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER VII. Corb. —I know thee honest.Mosca. —You do lie, sir. Volpone. It was quite dark before Horsey and his companion came to a halt; and when this was done, the former looked round him with astonishment, as he could not well divine at first the reason for doing so. There was no more sign of habitation or human comfort then, than had been seen at the moment when he encountered the dwarf. Indeed, if possible, the locale looked decidedly worse than ever. The very spot on which they stopped was a perfect quagmire, to which the rising waters of the contiguous river had access at every freshet; and, beheld in the uncertain starlight, our actor could see that there were ponds all around him, and little crossing brooklets that seemed to struggle slowly through the thickening ooze, as if seeking to regain the parent stream, by whose subsiding torrents they had been left. A dense wall of canes spread itself over the path in front, and Horsey was about to give utterance to the doubt and bewilderment which he felt, when his companion, who seemed in no ways disconcerted, uttered a shrill whistle, which was immediately answered by the deep bay of a beagle at a little distance ahead. “They will find us now in a twinkling,” said Jones; “that dog will soon tell them where to look, even if that crooked scamp, Stillyards, should prove a sluggard by the way. You will be relieved of your nag in a few moments, Mr. Horsey, and we will coon a log for the rest of our journey. So much for living in a swamp—these are difficulties which would scarcely trouble us in Natchez or New Orleans.” “Well, but why do you incur them? Why live in the swamp?” demanded Horsey, to whom the increasing difficulties and perplexities of the last twenty minutes of circuitous navigation had begun to suggest certain doubts of the policy of choosing places of abode for which there seemed no justifying necessity. “Ha!” said the other, with a laugh, “there are troubles in the city which we have not here, and which we count a great deal worse. Here we should laugh at a sheriff's officer—there we should pull hat and bend knee to him in respectful deference; and if you ever blarneyed a tailor or bullied a landlord—” “Say no more,” said Horsey, to whom the references of Jones seemed to have almost a personal direction, and were therefore sufficiently conclusive —“say no more—I see the wisdom of your arrangements, and were I as near New Orleans as you are to Vicksburg and Benton, I should most probably have needed no explanation.” Some merry references to the artifices and annoyances of duns and dunnees followed this sally, in the relation of which the experience of the two seemed to be by no means unequal. If Jones had his story of sharps and flats in Vicksburg, Natchez, Manchester, and Benton, Horsey could tell tales quite as lively of Mobile and Orleans; and could these stories have been heard by the city sufferers, the consolation would have been of a sort to have induced a large addition to the sum total on the off side of the profit and loss account. Certainly, the most patient of all fashionable costumers would have cursed such customers. Their merriment had not subsided, when the figure of a man plunging from a fallen tree that lay half covered and quite concealed in the dark by the canes which grew luxuriantly around it, presented himself in front, and immediately took charge of their horses. A word between Jones and the new-comer furnished sufficient explanation; and the former, telling Horsey to follow him closely, put aside the canes which concealed the fallen tree, and was, an instant after, hidden from sight. Horsey followed promptly, and found himself on a sort of natural bridge which carried him safely over a creek, of whose existence, though but ten feet from where he had been standing, he had not till that moment been aware. Though deep, and pursuing a direct course to the Loosa-Chitta, it kept so quiet a travel all the while that its murmurs were barely heard among the canes that grew out of it, even when Horsey stood directly above its bed; and the assurance of his companion only then certified him of its existence. “Steady now, Mr. Horsey. The creek below you has a depth of ten feet, and a sudden souse at this moment would startle more alligators than a man could ride for a half-mile around us. There is some soft clay on the log that makes it slippery, and if you find it ticklish, you had better squat in time and coon it.” But Horsey was too good a Mississippian to need such cautious counsel, and he boldly followed his conductor after his own fashion, and in perfect safety. A few moments brought them to the end of 10* the tree, when, leaping to the earth, after the example of his companion, our traveller once more, after a long interval, found himself upon terra firma. “Here we are,” exclaimed Jones, “in the immediate neighbourhood of Cane Castle. Our way is clear enough, though it still seems thick to your eyes. We are in an Indian trail, which the Choctaws have used, I reckon, for a thousand years. I know it was ready made to our hands—our feet, rather—and very good use we've made of it so far. Congratulate yourself, Mr. Horsey, that there's no hope for a sheriff here! We have security in the bog and liberty in the brake, for which I know one poor devil that would pray in vain were he in the swamp at Natchy. Here you may laugh as loud as you please, and sing as perverse, and no one to remind you of laws and judges—no one to say `shut up— you shall neither sing nor smoke.' There's no law here against tobacco.” These assurances, which promised so great a degree of liberty to the habitual swearer, singer, and smoker, and which, in brief, summed up the amount total of what are usually defined as the blessings of civil and religious liberty, did not, however, seem to awaken that degree of satisfaction in the mind of the actor, which was justified by the importance of the promised benefits. A word about the cast of characters, or the selection of pieces, or any thing, however immaterial, in the business of staging, would have called for infinitely more of his regards. Receiving no answer to what he had spoken, Jones, with practised cunning, readily changed the subject to one more grateful; and mustering all that he could remember of the plays he had ever read and seen acted, he contrived, by some imperfect quotations, to divert the attention of Horsey from such subjects of speculation as would most probably have occurred to almost every ordinary traveller in his present situation. Naturally frank and unsuspicious, it was by no means difficult to deceive a person whose mind was so completely surrendered up to the one engrossing passion; and though exceedingly acute in his judgments, and active in his inquiries, on all subjects not actually swallowed up in the maelstrom of that mania which, at an instant, absorbed every thing that came within its whirling vortex, yet nothing was more easy than to lead him off from the minor pursuit by the suggestion of the smallest gleam from that greater object which was the all in all of his desires. But on this head the reader wants no new lights at this late moment. He, perhaps, unlike the deluded traveller of whom we write, is not so sure of the Thespian character of those performers whom the worthy Horsey is about to encounter in the swamp. He is not now to be told that—but why should we anticipate? A few moments sufficed, following the little Indian footpath and his companion, to bring the actor into something like an opening in the forest, which consisted of mingled pines, cypresses, and ash-trees, closely set, and still more closely united—save in the opening mentioned—by the matted canes, which seemed to fill up all the intervals between them, and, in fact, formed a dense margin to every one of the hundred beds of watery ooze which skirted the river, the rank and festering deposit of a thousand years. Here the actor was encountered by gay gleams of firelight at a little distance, by the imperfect blaze of which, he discovered himself to be on the verge of a little area, or amphitheatre, in the swamp, high and dry, a sort of island, the circuit of which was probably a meagre quarter of a mile in extent. This, following his conductor, he rapidly overpassed, until they reached a sort of nook from whence the fire met their eyes. Here they found as merry a set of scamps at their revels as ever blessed the sight of a wayfarer on the edge of a gipsy encampment. They were about seven or eight persons, squat upon their haunches, and busily engaged in the adventurous business of vingt-un; a sight that warmed the heart of our traveller even more than a smoking supper might have done, since, though not absolutely dramatic in itself, it suggested to his mind one of those leading associations of theatrical life, which brought back his fading memories with fresh colours, and greatly increased their vitality. But if their present employment seemed natural enough to the heyday recklessness of the ordinary actor's life, there was little beside, in their air and appearance, to justify, in the mind of Horsey, their adoption of the business. He looked in vain for that happy ease, sometimes, in “mouths of wisest censure,” esteemed impudence, which distinguishes so greatly the actor by profession. The dashing effrontery, the devil-may-care deportment of the sect was lacking. There was none of the graceful swagger of the genteel comedian—none of the solemn emphasis of him who wears the image of fate, and looks habitual tragedy upon his brow, a Prometheus-like gloom and defiance which would have realized the ideal of an æschylus, and filled the eyes of the poet with the figures that else had only had existence in his mind; and as for the comedy of stare, and grin, and clatter —the broad fun, and ridiculous, reckless, farce— never was pleasant companie so utterly without its enlivening and mirth-compelling attributes. The very soul of every rascal in the group seemed set only upon the sixpences before him. Mammon, not Momus, was the god of the entertainment, and our traveller's anticipations were taken half aback, as he beheld an expression of care and intensity in every face, so utterly unlike that good-humoured indifference to fate and fortune, which hitherto had been to him one of the chief attractions among his intimates of the lobby and the green-room. “These chaps have greatly mistaken their profession,” was the unexpressed thought of the idealist. “There is not a scamp among 'em who will ever do more than snuff a candle or shout at a pageant. They will give me no support—they will bungle most damnably. `Then came each actor on his ass.' Gad! the ass will be uppermost here. But these are supernumeraries only. There must be others. I must wait. At least, I am sure of good foils, if I have no rivals; and if they can make play at all, they will give me all the chance I want. But they are mere Turks and Muscoghees—a sort of savages that will never stop till they scalp what they have murdered. Their parts are all in danger of a bloody death. But—buz! buz!” The introduction of the stranger was rapidly gone through with—too rapidly to enable our traveller to witness any of those beauties of deportment which he still fancied might make their appearance in that nice performance—the reception of a guest for the first time—which so eminently calls for a pleasing and prompt gracefulness, without which reception is more properly repulsion, and an invitation to make oneself at home, looks very like a suggestion to depart. Jones seemed to conjecture what was passing in Horsey's mind, and took an opportunity, a few minutes after, to say to him, in a whisper, that the giants were yet to arrive—these were the pasteboard personages—that class of creatures which we use from necessity, and keep out of sight when we can. “But they will improve, Mr. Horsey, under your tuition—under your example I mean. They have had no opportunities—have seen no shining lights, and are shy, sir, very shy—much cannot be expected from them as yet; but when you have given us some readings, Mr. Horsey—then, &amp;c.” It was not surprising after this appeal, that our vain actor beheld his companions with a look of greater indulgence and more charitable thoughts. The wily Jones knew all his soundings, and the tragedian was little more than a puppet in his hands. Meanwhile new fires were built, new combinations formed, and Horsey found himself as busy about the blaze as the rest, and, though with a less intense feeling than the rest, receiving his cards, and “planking” his shillings. His friend Jones sat beside him and assisted him as a partner to lose his money in the game. As the “stakes” disappeared, the good humour of the group seemed to increase, and the contagious mirth soon made Horsey as indulgent in his criticism as unmindful of his losses. He thought the scamps susceptible of improvement, and, stimulated by the suggestions and applauses of Jones, his quotations became recitations; and his own language was at length limited to a few occasional comments which served to introduce and link together the choicest declamatory passages of Shakspeare. The Toms, Dicks, and Harries around him looked as grave and seemed as attentive as possible; but it might have been perceived by one more watchful than our amateur, that none of them forgot the game in the delight which he felt or affected to feel, and the stakes were always lifted as soon as won. They were men who had long since learned to combine the severest cares of business with the utmost relaxations of pleasure. “That was superbly said, Mr. Horsey,” remarked the attentive and respectful Jones, as the actor concluded the famous soliloquy in Hamlet, “to be,” &amp;c. —“I can say with confidence that I have never heard that passage delivered before, though I have heard it a hundred times from other lips. You make us feel the poet, sir, and tremble at the philosophy. Ah, sir, how these reflections come to us, poor outcasts of fortune, like so many dreadful experiences. Who has not asked himself whether it was not better and nobler to make his own quietus with a bare bodkin, rather than suffer the thousand cruel and crushing evils, such as the rest of the passage has described. Not that it is all evil, Mr. Horsey. I am disposed to think, so far as my experience goes, that that part of it about `the law's delay' might very well be left out. The law's delay, sir, is one of the most agreeable features which the law ever shows to a poor debtor like myself, and as I have said before, but for the law's delay, and that of the deputy, many's the poor devil who would have lain at the mercy of tailor and tapster, without hope or redress, to the detriment of his genius, and to the great loss of the majority of mankind. I'm thinking, Mr. Horsey, that that half line might very well be left out of the passage.” “Impossible, Mr. Jones,—there would be an ugly hiatus—the music of the line would be lost—utterly lost.” “But the passage might be altered—something might be supplied in its place. Suppose we were to read—`the play's delay'—now that would be such an improvement as would be grateful to every ambitious actor.” This suggestion grated on the ears of our amateur. He was one of those profound devotees of the great literary outlaw, who venerate his very faults, even as the antiquarian treasures up the rust and canker of the relic. To remove any thing, in his eyes, would be to impair the value and take from the propriety of what remained; and his reply was uttered in tones more energetic than he had hitherto employed. “Sacrilege! sacrilege, Mr. Jones,—how can you think of it! No, sir, the passage must stand as it is —neither too little nor too much—nothing can be added, nothing taken away. It's true, as you say, the law's delay is a very agreeable thing to the debtor. Gad, sir, I have been indebted to it quite as often as yourself; but our notions would be greatly altered if we stood in the creditor's shoes; we should then hold the passage to be perfect as it is; as, indeed, I hold it now, having no debtors, and being still overshoes on the books of other men. No, no! sir—no liberties with Shakspeare—remember the admirable counsel to this effect which he gives to our profession in particular on this very head—to `speak no more than is set down for them.' I can forgive a fellow when he is out and the audience waiting, and the prompter asleep, if he fills out from his own head; but when he does it out of presumption, seeking to improve the work of the mighty master, `that's villanous, and shows a most pitiful ambition in the fool,' that does it.” “I don't know but you're right, sir.” “I am! I am right, Mr. Jones—I am positive in this matter. The more you think of it, sir, the more you'll have occasion to agree with me; and in the beginning of our campaign, sir, the thing cannot be too much insisted upon for the benefit of the whole company.” “I was thinking, sir,” said Jones, with some hesitation of manner, and a bow and look of particular deference almost amounting to veneration—“I was thinking, sir, that it might be of great service to our boys, if you'd be so good as to give us your reading of that very part.” “What! the advice to the players?” “Yes, sir—I'm sure there's not one present that would not be delighted to hear it from your lips. What say you, boys—what Ricks, Mason, Baker, Bull?” “Ay, ay! let's have it!” was the lively cry from all, in tones far less full of solicitous deference, and a great deal more indifferent than those of Jones. Meanwhile, however, the cards were shuffled, the stakes set down and lifted, and the game underwent no cessation, though, in the excitement of his declamation, our friend Horsey's cards remained upon the turf, from which, however, his stakes were always considerately withdrawn by the banker, as soon as laid before him. “But it will interrupt the game,” was the considerate suggestion of the actor. “Our friends would rather play than listen to those dull recitations, of which they hear so much professionally.” “Devil a bit!” was the warm reply of Jones to the modest apprehension of Horsey. “Devil a bit! Dull recitations, indeed. By —! such luxuries are more than they are used to—more, perhaps, than they deserve. Put up your hands, men, while Mr. Horsey gives us these passages; down with your pictures, take up your picayunes, and let us surrender our souls for a while to the scene. By the way, Mr. Horsey, if you have no objection, the thing might be made more complete—the illusion rendered more striking and fascinating,—in short, sir,—if you would consent—” He paused and looked in the actor's face with doubt and entreaty, equally mingled with respectful deference;—but he spoke not. “What, Mr. Jones?” was the demand of Horsey, VOL. II. 11 who was at that moment too well pleased to have refused the speaker any thing in his power to bestow, and who felt assured, from the manner of Jones, that he was only about to solicit some farther extension of that courtesy, the concession of which was, perhaps, far more gratifying to him than it could be to the hearers. The reply of Jones was uttered in the hesitating accents of one who still scrupled to give offence. “If I remember—I think, Mr. Horsey—nay, you did tell me, that you had brought with you a portion of your wardrobe.” “You are right, sir,—I have with me a Hamlet and a Romeo, a Rolla, a Turk and two field officers, in my bags, but—” “The very thing, my dear sir!” cried Jones, with an air of inexpressible delight—“and now, sir,” he continued, “if you would only crown your favours and give us your readings in costume—give us the favourite passages in Hamlet, which, I should think, from what you have suffered us to see, your best performance, you would bind us to you eternally. It would make us so happy—it would help us so greatly—we should all be so much pleased, not to speak of the immense benefit—that—that—” Here the cunning dog stopped very judiciously, leaving unexpressed the superb climax which the imagination of the hearer was better able to provide, than the flattery of the eulogist. Soothed, seduced, perfectly overcome, in the weakness of his heart, by the adroit management of the wily Jones, the reluctance of the actor was very feeble. He said something about his horse and saddle-bags not having come, and murmured a fear that he might be tiresome. But these objections were soon met and overruled by the other. “Your horse is here in our stables. The bags you can get at in a moment; and if you will go with me, we can put you at once into a chamber where you can make all your changes without disturbance.” There was no resisting the pleasant importunities of his companion; and, following his guidance, Horsey was led through a contiguous thicket into another smaller area, where he found several huts of bushes and bark, in one of which his horse was fastened, along with that of Jones; while the fellow who had taken charge of them, lay fast asleep before the door, using the saddle-bags of the actor for his pillow. He was soon aroused, and made to carry them into another of the huts, where Jones, having studiously repeated his flatteries, left the delighted actor to prepare his toilet prior to his first rehearsal before his new companions. These, meanwhile, had their own thoughts on the subject of the new-comer. “Now, what the devil can Jones be after,” was the muttered speech of one surly fellow of the circle, “in bringing this conceited ass among us? He seems to have precious little money, and he's not worth robbing; he's a fool and can't be trusted; and why we are to pretend to be actors, and all that nonsense, and listen to his stuff, is more than I can reckon up at a single tuning. What do you say, Baker—do you understand it?” “No better than yourself, but I s'pose there's something in it, since Jones says that he's ordered by Saxon. Saxon's after some strange business, I reckon, and I s'pose he's got his reasons. What they are I don't care to know, so long as the fellow has a Mexican to lose, and don't know when he loses.” “Nor when he wins, for that matter,” said another. “Bull gathered up his stakes and winnings together, the first time in his life that ever his losses filled his pockets.” “The fellow's well enough,” said Bull, with a growling chuckle—“so say no more. I'm for his playing cards, or any thing he pleases, so long as the playing is profitable to us. But here's Jones coming back; let us know all about it from him.” “How now, growlers?” said this last named person, as he returned among the group. “Can't you be satisfied with your gettings, when they come with so little trouble. This fellow's your pidgeon, pluck him as you please; but look you that he does not guess what you're about. Take your counsel from me, and humour him awhile—it will give us quite as much sport as profit.” “But what's the upshot of the business—are we to stop his wind, or is he to be one of the family? He'll never make a beagle, so long as his head's full of play stuff.” “Let that give you no trouble. It's enough that Saxon plans it. This fellow's nothing in himself, but we use him against another. There's one thing, let me tell you, before you go further. Weston is dead —shot through the head by a young lawyer going up to Lucchesa, on t'other side of the river by Big Ben's. There's a start below against us, and the old methodist, Badger, is beginning to growl aloud. So, lie close—there's no fear of the dad, while the son is a beagle. He'll give tongue enough when the hunt's a-foot. As for this chap, all that you have to do is to wink, look wise—talk what player nonsense you can, and praise him for his acting, whenever he asks questions that you can't answer. That will stop his tongue, and turn his thoughts, and that's all that you've to do. I'll manage all the rest of the business. Put up your cards now, and get the grog in readiness, and let Girhan get our supper, while I'm gone for the actor. You'll see him in his glory when he comes back, but no grinning—nothing to frighten him. Hear him with open mouths, and if you can throw in a bit of blarney, let it be done. But do it neatly—nothing slippery—nothing stupid. The fellow's no fool when he aint flattered—it's soft soap only that turns his head. Enough—you have the trail.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">11* CHAPTER VII. Serv. —My lord, you nod; you do not mind the play.Sly. —Yes, by Saint Anne, I do. A good matter, surely. Comes there any more of it? Taming of the Shrew. When Jones returned to his comrades, accompanied by Horsey in character, the scene had undergone a change. The cards had disappeared—fires were lighted anew—a rude plank table, with rude block seats, had risen in the midst, garnished with sundry black bottles of strong waters, and every thing looked fair for a promising carouse. The men, too, had undergone some little change. The exhortations of Jones had not been lost upon them, and, taking it for granted that their account lay, as it had always done before, in securing the desires of their leaders, they were prepared to yield themselves, heart and hand, to the game that was before them. A warm cheer, thrice renewed, received the actor, who stalked before them in all the mournful and philosophical dignity of the youthful Dane. A buz—a murmur of approbation, followed this outbreak, and, whether sincere or affected, the result was every thing that might be desired. For the first time in his life, Horsey found himself in the presence of actors who were not rivals—candidates for popular favour, who had no jealousy of their neighbours— and professors of an art that lives on popular applause, who were yet no less prompt in bestowing it. Our traveller was the last man in the world to mortify himself with any unnecessary doubts of that sincerity which spoke in the language of encomium. And yet, to do his understanding all justice, it must be added that Jones took infinite pains to avoid arousing his suspicions. His own applauses were all well timed, judiciously expressed, and had the appearance of being urged with great hesitation and forbearance. A respectful deference distinguished even his solicitude; and his chief argument to Horsey, and one which he insisted on in frequent whispers, was the necessity of a good model for his wretched creatures. “These fellows have never played before, my dear Mr. Horsey. They have been picked up from all parts of the country. Some of them have never even looked upon a play, and none of them have any just idea of what a performance should be. I know the trouble it will give you to tutor them, but it is so important that we should make a good figure at first, and if, as I believe, you regard the drama as so important to the civilization of the people—to the improvement of popular taste, and— and—” All this kind of stuff was very convincing to our stage-struck hero. His eye brightened while he looked around him, and surveyed the mute watchfulness and vague curiosity of stare that met his glance on every side. “Something can be made of them, Jones,” he said paternally, in a confidential whisper, “and, considering the great importance of the thing, I am not unwilling to undertake their tuition. You are right in regarding it as all important that they should know something before they begin; though, really, it is surprising—very surprising—that they should have ever thought of the stage. It seems to me that any other vocation—” The comment was answered by a conclusive whisper. “Beggars, you know, Mr. Horsey, cannot be choosers. We must make the most of them till a better bargain offers, and then I'm clear that we get rid of them. On this head we must confer together hereafter. We must take the management into our own hands, since Tilton's off, and there's no knowing where to set hands on Peters. It is a happy chance that sent you in our neighbourhood. I was beginning to think matters desperate, and had almost given up in despair, and gone off. Now, there's no danger. You will set us on our feet again. But there's time enough to talk of this hereafter. Now, the lads are waiting. Gentlemen, Mr. Horsey is ready—pray give your attention.” “Ay, ay,” exclaimed the surly fellow, Bull, “and so are we. We've been ready this half-hour to hear him; but, Jones, s'pose, if it's not disagreeable to Mr. Horsey, let's take a swig all round to better acquaintance. It sort-a makes a body easy to listen when the liquor's afloat; and sort-a softens the ear and opens the understanding. I always feels a great deal easier to judge, when I'm in sperrits.” “Vulgar fellow!” muttered Horsey to himself, annoyed at an interruption at the very moment when, throwing himself into posture, he was about to begin. He concealed his chagrin as well as he could, while the vigilant Jones, calling to order, endeavoured to keep down the moral scum which promised to rise up with quite as much pertinacity as ever, with the very next agitation of the atmosphere. “A good idea of Bull's, that, Mr. Horsey,” said the politician. “A glass to better acquaintance is not amiss; though I'm not so sure it makes one judge the better in intellectual matters and things of art. What have you there, gentlemen?” “Monongahela, fresh from Beattie's Bluff,” was the reply of Bull. “There's a piggin of peach in the bushes, the last of the barrel—prehaps the gentleman will take his pull from that?” “Prehaps!—Take his pull!” Horsey could scarce suppress his astonishment, and forbear repeating the offensive vulgarities aloud. “Our Jack Pudding!—our fellow for broad grin and buffoonery!” whispered Jones in the ear of the amateur. “A very comical fellow when he's in the humour, Mr. Horsey—never saw so comical a dog as he can make himself. All this is put on—it's in character only. He is only disposed to let you see that there are other actors beside yourself.” “Indeed! Is that it? but he looks very serious for a funny fellow.” “That's the beauty of it, sir—that's the wonder— that's what makes him inimitable in his way. You'll hear him speak the dialect of the most ignorant backwoodsman, as if he was born to it, and look for all the world as if he never could have spoken any other. But, I can tell you, so far from that being the case, he's well educated—speaks Greek like a native, and is profound in mathematics, besides having an excellent taste in poetry.” “Is it possible?” “True as Holy Writ; but he has humours, sir —and one of them is to disparage himself. He will even lie, sir—lie like a Trojan—in order to make himself little. Ask him now about Greek, and if he happens to be in the humour for running his cross rigs upon you, he'll swear he knows nothing of what you say, and will probably answer you in the coarsest lingo of Catahoula and the swamp.” “A strange perversity, indeed.” “It's the way with all geniuses, I believe; but— here he comes. Don't mind his extravagancies. You'll see the fun of them, now that you know something of the fellow.” By this time Bull returned, bearing in his hands the piggin of peach-brandy, for which he had gone to the bushes where it had been concealed. His salutation as he placed the vessel on the table, was calculated to justify in some sort the description which had been just given of his eccentricities. “Here, you bitches,” he cried aloud—“here's stuff enough, and sorts enough, if your stomach's not too swingy proud for an honest liquor. This peach is a beauty, and the whisky's as lovely as a sinner alongside of it. If you don't like one, take the other, and if you don't like neither, mix 'em and swig both, and see which end'll come uppermost. Blast my buttons—what do you wait for, you—” We omit the more decided expressions of blackguardism. “You see,” whispered Jones to the actor, “he's as full of Aristophanes as an egg's full of meat. Fond of all the old comic writers, and don't stand at calling things by plain names. You'll know more of him directly.” Horsey drew a long breath as he replied— “'Gad! he is the strangest fellow—” His speech and wonder were briefly cut short by the uproarious challenge of the eccentric Bull, who, having filled a tin mug of more than usual dimensions with one of the two potent beverages so highly eulogized, extended his gracious permission, after a fashion of his own, to all others who might be disposed to follow his example. “I'm a man that has a notion that all sperrits loses that stands too long open to the air. You must pour it down or cork it up, one or t'other, and so, fellows, I drinks to you, and my sentiments is— here's to the tongue that never sticks in the way of the swallow—meaning no harm to them that stands off talking, when they might be doing a better business.” And with these words, and a scornful leer at the actor and his companion, Jones, the Grecian humourist turned the bottom of the can to the north star, while the mouth of it clung for an instant to his own with a sympathetic tenacity. “Well said! Well hit!” exclaimed the ready Jones, with a wink, to Horsey. “We certainly deserve the censure of all good spirits, when we leave such good spirits untasted. Horsey, my dear fellow, shall I pour you out from the jug or the piggin? I can answer for this peach—it's as good as any of Crumbaugh's.” “The peach, I thank you,” was the answer of Horsey, in somewhat subdued accents. The fact is, his genius was confounded in the presence of that of Mr. Aristophanes Bull, of whom, as yet, he could not exactly succeed in reconciling what he saw with what he heard. A little time after, and he grew more flexible; but let us not anticipate. His glass was filled, and with the kindest condescension in the world, he bowed to the company ere he drank, and uttered some common-place compliment, which was lost, like many better wishes, in the unheeding air. “And now, gentlemen, give attention—now for the part of Hamlet by Mr. Horsey, of whom you all have heard, and by whose counsel and example, I trust we shall all improve. Mr. Horsey, perhaps that part about actors and acting—I mean the advice to the players—might be the best to begin with; unless, indeed, you should prefer to give us some more tragic parts. I know that your forte lies in tragedy.” Such was the conciliatory preludium of the adroit Jones, and its effect promised to be exceedingly happy upon the person to whom it was addressed. A smile rose upon his lips, his eyes sparkled, as he felt the convincing deference of the speaker, and a ray of self-complaisance, such as the sun sheds over the western heavens, after he has done a good day's work of illumination, gave to our actor's face an inexpressible benignity of beam, which was most unhappily overcast, in another instant, by the intrusive comments of the eccentric genius, Bull. “Tragedy be d—d,” said he, striking his hand down upon the table, to which, in the next moment, he elevated his foot; “tragedy be d—d—that's all in my eye and Betty Martin. There's no fun in that, no more than in thunder and hoxy-doxy. Who wants to see a fellow get up and blow out his cheeks, and roll up his eyes, and growl and roar and choke, and shake all over as if he had an agy? None of your tragedy for me. There's no sense in it. 'Taint raal. I was once down in Mobile, when I saw them making tragedies, and, darken my peepers, but the bloody bitches made me mad enough to swallow 'em, they were so cussed rediculous.” “But, my dear Bull,” was the beginning, thrice begun, of our friend Jones, in the endeavour to stop the torrent of the humourist. In vain—Bull kept his ground, and shook off the intruder with as much ease as a three year old colt would shake off a Connecticut cavalry officer. “Oh, be d—d,” said he, “don't I know? There was a tragedian that came in looking after his enemy. He had his sword out, and he made a show as if he was mighty angry, but, between you and me, he didn't want to find him, no how. The other fellow was hiding behind a tree, and this chap looked for him every where but there. So, as I wanted to see how they'd fight, I up and told him where to look for him—says I, bung up my peepers, if you don't find him agin that rock, squat, jist hiding behind that tree. It was a scrub oak, or something like it—I never seed sich a tree before. Well, instead of thanking me, he dropped his jaws and his sword, looked at me as if he'd seed a ghost, mumbled something in his throat, nobody could tell what, and then there was a spree among the people, and some of the larks below cried out as if they were gwine to lick me. `Lick and be d—d,' says I, `lick if you can. Where's the first man?—let me look at him.' So up I stands, and devil the bit of a nigger among 'em to say another word. Well, that was all bloody foolish. If the chap was in 'arnest, it was the easiest thing to find the other. He had only to say I'm ready, clap his hip, and crow like a chicken, and if they was ser'ous, what more? But tragedies aint ser'ous things. It's all make-b'lieve. They know there's nobody to be hurt,—nobody's in 'arnest; for they'll stand and talk for a long quarter, though the enemy's at the door, with bullet and bowie-knife; and they pretending to be mighty scared all the time. Then they hide where it's so easy to find 'em. Grim! only let a nigger hide from me in Loosa-Chitta as them fellows hide from one another in tragedies, and how soon I'd ride through their rig'lets. I'd be into 'em, and on 'em; over 'em, and through 'em; round 'em, and about 'em; front 'em, and a-back 'em; in the twinkle of a musquito—race-lightning never could go quicker. No! no! None of your tragedies for me.” “But, Bull, my dear fellow!” expostulated Jones, with something more of anxiety in his accents and manner, as he saw the almost pallid expression of VOL. II. 12 discomfiture in the blank visage of Horsey—“why should you go on so? Though you don't like tragedy, that's no reason why other people should not, and we who labour for the public, or propose to do so, must do that which will best please the public. Now, there's no doubt that most people prefer tragedy—” “The more fools they!” stoutly replied the obdurate Bull. “They're not of my kidney, then, by hocus; and I reckon there's none of the boys here that wouldn't prefer a sup of whisky at any time, and a frolic at mother Surgick's, to all the tragedy stuff.” “But, Bull, my dear fellow—” Jones resumed his expostulations, but in vain. Bull had been supping whisky for a good hour before Horsey had reached the camp, and had grown too inflexible to engage with readiness in any scheme so intricate as the one proposed. “Butt Bull,” he retorted, using the language of Jones, with a grin, as if a good joke lay at the bottom—“Butt Bull, and get the worst of it. See who's head's the hardest, you b—h, and be off with your mug broken. It's a bad chance to butt any of my breed. No, blast my buttons! hide and horns, head and tail, are all too much for such as you, Jones; so no rearing, unless you want to come down on your haunches.” “A wit, you see,” said Jones, in a whisper to the waiting Hamlet—“a fellow of infinite humour;— and as he's a little drunk he begins to show it. The true nature always comes uppermost with a man in liquor. A fellow of contradictions,—we must bear with him a while longer.” There was little or no consolation in all this for the actor. He began to suspect that the organization of such an unruly gang would task the best manager in the worst fashion. He saw treason, uproar, and utter discomfiture in all the proceedings of the green-room. But he said nothing in reply to Jones, and before the latter could say more, the sarcastic Bull had resumed the subject of which he seemed as tenacious as the grave. “Now,” said he, “if you're for acting at all, give me them funny things, where they make all sorts of faces, and play tricks, and tumble one another about, and jump on shoulders and ride like monkeys, and run up the chimney, and hide behind the door. Give me the comedies and farces, and them sort of things that make a fellow laugh to split. I'm for the frolicking plays, and I reckon we're all for them. Aint you, Baker?” “Ay, deuce take me, if I don't vote with Bull,” was the response of Mr. Baker. “And I too,” said another. “And I,” said a third. And the majority sent up an assenting voice which put a stop for an instant to all the expostulations of the indefatigable Jones. Bull looked round him with an air of triumph and complacency, as much as to say,—there, you have our decision, so let your tragedy be comedy—your fate, fun! He filled up his can, as the difficult question was thus determined to his own satisfaction; and, as if to reconcile the minority to a decision which is always disagreeable to a minority, he proposed a bumper all round. “Come Jones, come Doughty,” so he named Horsey, “my dogs, we'll begin the fun by a full swallow. I'm always for a frolic when there's good stuff to go upon; and a comedy, says I, because a comedy's always ser'ous earnest, and it's all my eye when they makes tragedies. Tragedies is mighty foolish and ridiculous things. They aint ser'ous. The killing aint ser'ous. I don't reckon a man was ever yet killed in a tragedy. Now, I'm for killing in 'arnest when I set about it. I don't leave off when I begin, and if I once put knife into a fellow's ribs to make small meat of him, wouldn't I be a blasted fool to go off, before I made sure that the thing was done in right 'arnest? I'd git on him astraddle and feel at his kidneys; and if there was only the littlest shaking of the flesh, d—me but I'd give him another dig or two to make sure and put him out of his misery. I would, d—me.” There was something exceedingly literal in the latter part of Bull's speech, which our friend Horsey found it very difficult to account for. It seemed to him that the witty fellow was confounding real events with theatrical illusion; and the idea of his bestraddling his slain opponent, and giving him a thrust extra seemed rather Choctaw-like and savage. Besides, he could not understand how such a proceeding should ever be tolerated by an audience. On this head he thought it important to express his doubts. This he did, however, with less than his usual fecund flow of language, and with a hesitancy of manner which showed how greatly the eccentric genius of Bull had cowed himself, no less than the rest of his companions. “I am afraid, Mr. Bull, the spectators would not permit such an unnecessary proceeding. The moment the man lies, apparently dead, the end of the performance is obtained. There is surely no sort of necessity to repeat the blow; and I am afraid that the dignity of tragedy would be utterly overthrown by bestraddling the slain man. I am also disposed to think—” “Look you, Doughty, my boy,” cried Bull, with an air of most paternal superiority, clapping his open hand as he spoke over the mouth of the tragedian— “you're but a young hand at the hatchet, I see. Do you think,” with an air of great seeming circumspection, as he bent his mouth to the ear of the hearer, and spoke in a half whisper—“you talk of spectators, but do you think I'd be such a blasted b—h of a fool as to let any body see me at the business?” “How! how!—the audience not see you?” The actor was bewildered. Jones, with some consternation interposed. The game at cross-purposes, which he had so cunningly introduced, was on the verge of a sudden termination. “Ha, ha! A good joke—an excellent joke!” he exclaimed aloud, laughing immoderately as he spoke —“Bull, you're a born devil of a joker. He's trying to quiz you, Mr. Horsey—I warned you how 'twould be—a very Momus, sir,—all fun, all mirth, all deviltry.” “Quiz me!” exclaimed the actor, with a genuine expression of tragedy—a sublime indignation—in his countenance as he spoke, which, in an instant after, changed to one of haughty defiance, as his eyes turned from Jones to the person of him to whom had been ascribed the impertinent effort which promised to be so offensive. “Nay, take no offence, Mr. Horsey—don't you see the man's drunk,” said Jones, in a whisper. “But I'll mend his manners—I'll lead him off for a while, and cool him. I'll say that which will bring him to his senses.” “Tell him you'll discharge him!” said Horsey, with all the terrors of a managerial countenance, as he whispered this severe counsel in the ears of the other. “By the body of Polonius, it would be impossible to keep such a fellow in order—all his merits, were they twice what they are, could never reconcile me to tolerate such presumption.” “You are right, perfectly right, sir, and I'll make 12* him hear to reason,” said Jones—“meanwhile, sir, when I take him off, do you occupy the rest. They are very anxious to hear you—very good fellows, sir—a little tainted with Bull only. They will keep order.” While this brief dialogue proceeded between the two in whispers, the eccentric Bull had glided, by a very natural transition, from the proscenium into the orchestra, and was leading off, in a dithyrambic, famous among the beagles of the borders, to the air of the “Raccoon skinned”—a melody which only needs the lyrical genius of General Morris, who quelled the rioters of New York in 1834, to marry to universal song, and embalm, with other “refrains,” in the cedar oil of immortality. We shall copy it out, when more at leisure, for the special benefit of that gentleman; at present, a single verse must suffice, as well for him, as for our amateur. “Bish war ben it dan it nee Blit nel de mor; So ma nol, it cal a fe, —Chi, cha, cho, chow, Tra la chin, et car it lee, —Chi, cha, cho, chow, Blit nel de mor,”—etc. “Bull, a word with you,” said Jones, abruptly, as the uproarious ditty was ended. “Well, out with it, and be d—d to you. If it's only one, the pain's soon over.” “Come with me.” “Why can't you out with it here? D—n my sixes! There's no use to get up while one's able, and there's any stuff left. See here.” “Let it rest! It'll wait till you come back.” “I don't know that,” retorted the humourist— “and though it might, these d—d fellows won't— they swallow like a sandhill after a long drought in August. I'm almost afraid to leave it. If I go now, it's like parting with a friend for ever.” “Pshaw, Bull—what nonsense. There's business, I tell you.” These words, coupled with a particular and significant movement of the hands which escaped Horsey's observation, at once had an effect upon the person addressed. He rose, grumbling all the while, and followed his companion, leaving the field to our actor, who, like long pent up torrents, glad of the moment of liberation, soon burst with all his thunders upon the remaining assembly, and strove to make up for lost time by redoubled efforts. He was beginning to forget his previous annoyances in the evident attention of his audience, when Jones and the refractory Bull reappeared. The latter was somewhat sullen, but he remained silent for awhile, contenting himself with refilling his glass, and resuming his seat as before. He stuck his legs boldly upon the table, crossed his arms as if in contemplation, and, not deigning a glance at our actor, fixed his eyes upon the heavens, tracing Boötes, Orontes, and the rest, with a face of particular and philosophical speculation, and, possibly, discoursing in fancy with that venerable old gentlemen of nursery authority, the ancient and ever to be remembered, man in the moon—his dog and his bush. Thus he sat for some time in dogged silence, while our actor, who needed but little encouragement to rouse every echo known to the tragic muse, having already gone through several passages, proceeded to Macbeth. The soliloquy in the dagger-scene, being one upon which every witling labours to expend himself, was that which tasked all his powers; and whether he did well or ill, or whether it was because of some affinities in the passage which came home to the bosom and the business of Bull, it is certain that our actor's declamation in this part was honoured with a greater share of his attention than he had condescended to bestow previously. This did not escape the notice of Horsey, and he was beginning to congratulate himself that the eccentricities of the genius were about to pass away, leaving his lights their accustomed brilliance, when the grateful anticipation was suddenly defeated by the latter's starting to his feet, and thrusting his mug, well filled with the generous potation, full in the face of the actor, exclaiming, while he did so, and cutting off entirely the closing lines of the part— “Oh, d—n it, Thompson, take a drink and shut up. This tragedy stuff is too dry and dull—let's have no more of it. Here, drink, and let your tongue have a bit of a holiday.” The indignant actor could no longer restrain himself. His hand, which had been extended to grasp the imaginary dagger, was swept round in the twinkling of an eye, and the next moment the vessel was seen flying in the air, liberally bestowing its contents, in its flight, upon the face and bosom of the circle, among which the portion of Mr. Bull was in no manner stinted. This proceeding was the signal for an uproar, and Bull's hand was already laid upon the collar of Macbeth, whose blood was still rising, when the sudden appearance of another personage upon the scene, produced an instantaneous change in its circumstances.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER IX. “Ay, answer that, The questioner hath need,—where went he then?” The Royal Fugitive. The effect upon the group of the sudden appearance of a single person was no less strange than instantaneous. And this person was a woman. She emerged from the edge of the little nook, near which the revel had been carried on, and stood, without speaking a syllable, for several seconds, looking upon the circle with an expression of high-raised scorn in her countenance, which, though beheld only by the ruddy blaze of firelight, seemed to the eyes of our actor to be haughtily beautiful. Her complexion was dark, but richly lustrous. Her hair black as midnight, and glossy almost as its stars. Her eyes were large, quick, and dazzling, of the same deep raven hue with her tresses, which hung down upon her shoulders, streaming from beneath a sable network, which, covering her head, partially concealed her forehead also. Her person was rather masculine—her carriage majestic—and the involuntary notion which rose in the mind of Horsey, as he beheld her, was that she would make a most magnificent Lady Macbeth. Somewhat ashamed of being caught by a lady in a hand-to-hand scuffle with a genius like Benjamin Bull, our actor drew off from his opponent, who, to his surprise, exhibited an equal degree of willingness with himself to bring the contest to a sudden conclusion. He slunk away, and, with an evolution no less prompt than unlooked for, actually took shelter behind Horsey, surveying the intruder with eyes of cat-like cunning, mingled with some little apprehension, from over the shoulder of the actor. The effect upon the rest of the revellers was very nearly the same. In a moment they had left the board; and one or two, who were nearest to the woods, might have been seen stealing out of sight into the shadow of the contiguous trees. Jones was the only one of all the assembly who maintained his former place, and exhibited neither apprehension nor confusion. He met the gaze of the lady with respectful firmness, and, as he passed our actor in approaching the spot where she stood, whispered in his ears— “Our prima donna—our heroine—a star of the first magnitude. But—mum!” His finger touched his nose, and his air and gesture was that of one whose words, had they been supplied, would have been— “But a tartar of the first degree.” Horsey fancied such to be the meaning of the other's gestures, and was half confirmed in this opinion, when the first accents fell from the lips of the intruder. “Mr. Jones, I would speak with you a moment.” “Certainly, ma'am—I will but give some directions to the gentlemen, and follow you.” “Gentlemen!” was the half-subdued utterance of the lady in tones of scornful irony. “Gentlemen, indeed!” The words came faintly to the ears of Horsey, who stood, with Jones, somewhat in advance of the rest; and however little complimentary to himself and his companions, he could forgive the sneer which they expressed, in consideration of the intense superiority of manner which accompanied their utterance, and which assured him that the company was not entirely without a redeeming measure of that talent for theatricals, the want of which had hitherto appeared painfully conspicuous in his eyes, in spite of the obvious genius of Mr. Benjamin Bull and the flattering judgment of Mr. Jones. The lady turned on her heel, without farther word or look, disappearing in the recess of the woods, as suddenly as she came. “So, Bull,” said Jones, reproachfully, when she had gone, “it's just as I told you. Mark me,—you haven't heard the end of it. I warned you, but you must be drinking; and all that I said by way of counsel has been wasted upon you. She's heard all the uproar, and seen it too, and she will tell him every syllable when he comes. She will forget nothing. You know that.” “Ay, ay—blast it—she has the memory of a devil's dam. Well, there's no help now—I must grin and bear it,” said the genius, sullenly. “At least, it will be wise only to do no more mischief for the night. Away, all of you, to your nests; and no more uproar. There's no telling how soon he will be here, and if he finds you—” The speech was finished in a whisper to the parties immediately interested, and lost accordingly to our amateur. He had heard enough, however, to perceive that there was some mystery connected with his companions, some matter of domestic history, which was yet withheld from him. Who was “he” of whom Jones had spoken so emphatically, yet left unnamed; and why should a woman, however great might be her merits as a player, maintain an influence over the company, of such seemingly tyrannical extent—a tyranny which, from their spontaneous recognition of its sway, would seem to have been of habitual and undisputed exercise? The approach of Jones arrested his cogitations. “This path, Mr. Horsey, will lead you to your place of sleeping for the night. You will there find fire-light, and a boy waiting you. I will join you before you sleep.” “But, Mr. Jones—the lady—who is she?” “Our great gun—our princess—a most royal heroine. You see what a magnificent carriage she has?—she is tremendously popular—wins applauses wherever she goes—our trump-card which always secures the game. But she knows it, sir—that's the misfortune. She knows her popularity too well, and she is capricious in consequence. We have to humour her, sir, in all her fancies, and some of them are strange enough. You have no idea how extravagant she can be at times. Exercises the most tyrannous authority, and we dare not offend her.” “I'd like to know her. Suppose I go with you. You can introduce me, and, by the ghost of Garrick, Mr. Jones, to have a chat with such a woman, will only be a proper compensation for the annoyances I have had to undergo from that d—d comedian— that fellow Bull, of whom you think so highly.” “Not now,—not for the world to-night. She's in her fit to-night, and would fly at you like a tigress. To-morrow, or the next day, Mr. Horsey, as soon as the fit passes off. I'll tell you when she's in the humour to be seen.” “Do, do,—I long to know her. She looks as if she'd make a first-rate woman. But of whom did you speak when you threatened Bull with the anger of some person whom you did not name.” “Oh, that was her husband,—our chief musician. A bloody fellow, by the way, of whom Bull has a monstrous terror. He came nigh cutting Ben's throat once already, for some liberties he took with his wife, and since then we know how to keep him in order. We have only to say, `he is coming'— meaning her husband—and the fellow's tail's down in an instant. He loses all his with and humour, and skulks off, as he did to-night, out of sight and hearing, a most thorough-paced coward, as ever you saw. But I must leave you. Our princess is as jealous as her husband; and as I am acting manager at present, I must be careful how I offend her. Your path lies there—I will look in upon you as soon as I am dismissed from her presence.” Horsey, somewhat bewildered, followed the path which had been pointed out to him, while Jones proceeded to join the empress whose dictatorial summons, he really did not dare to disobey. The spot in which she received him was not far distant from that which the revellers had occupied. It was more thickly garnished with trees and shrubbery—more closely encircled by the swamp thicket, and, in place of a rude tent of bushes, such as served the rest of the company, a log-house was provided for her ladyship, rude and clumsy, it is true, but comparatively full of comforts, and not without its attractions. Deference, if not affection, seemed to have striven to gratify her pride, and commend itself to her consideration. A little arbour was raised before her door upon which the wild grape clambered; and rose bushes had been planted along the path, which was neatly shorn of weeds and made free of all obstructions. Within the cottage, the same care might have shown itself, in a hundred little particulars, VOL. II. 13 but we need not waste our attention upon details. The lady met Jones at the entrance, and, without a word, led the way into the dwelling. Her manner betrayed no little impatience. “You have been slow, Mr. Jones. I heard of your arrival some hours ago, and have been expecting your presence ever since.” “I had a particular charge, ma'am, which kept me busy. We had a stranger to manage, and—” “Ay, ay,—some other hopeful scheme—but I care not to listen to the small details of some new villany. My desire is to know where you left Saxon. That you have seen him, I know—that you must have seen him within a day, I am convinced. What I desire to know is, where you saw him last, and when I am to expect him here?” “Really, ma'am, it would be very difficult—nay almost impossible, for me to answer all these inquiries. You know, quite as well as I do, the danger that our captain incurs at this moment—nay, at every moment, and—” “Pshaw, Mr. Jones—you speak as if you thought me a fool, or doubted my prudence and fidelity. Is it likely, do you think, that I shall prove a traitor to Edward Saxon? or is there any probability that I shall deal in the small tittle-tattle of my sex, and, with its usual vanity, reveal, with unconscious stupidity, what I know, to those who might do him hurt. You know me better—you would evade my inquiries.” “On my honour, ma'am—” “None of that—none of that. Leave off your long preambles, and answer my question. When did you see your captain last, and where?—I repeat, I know that you have seen him within the last two days—where was it, and what was the precise time?” “Perhaps, ma'am, you have more knowledge at this moment of the captain's movements than myself. He has not confided to me any particulars but those which had connexion with the tasks upon which he has set me, and which I was endeavouring to execute at the very moment when you came out upon the bayou.” The woman looked upon the speaker with a degree of intense earnestness in her glance which savoured of a rising anger. Her dark eyes gleamed with the fires of a gathering thunder-storm, while a smile of ineffable scorn, that seemed like its softer lightnings, passed over her thin and ruddy lips. “Mr. Jones, you look upon me as upon a child, with whom you may trifle at pleasure. Why do you talk to me of your duties, and your efforts to execute them? I do not doubt your diligence, nor am I a miserable spy to watch your performance of them. I ask a simple answer in reference to the movements of another—of your captain, sir?” “Yes, ma'am, but you know my oath. I am forbidden—” “What! to communicate with me? Has he then forbidden you? Ah! has it come to that—does he fear that I should know? Are his doings of such a character? An outlaw to society, is he faithless also to me?—and you—you, sir, know, and are forbidden to declare. It is well, sir—very well—it is exactly what I thought—exactly. You may go, sir, —go! I ask you not to betray your leader, sir,— keep his secrets—conceal his perjuries—cloak his excesses—you are both worthily employed—both. Fear not, I shall do you justice to your captain. You may go now. I have done with you. I have no more questions.” This speech was spoken with an impetuosity which defied all interruption. The torrent of passion convulsed the frame of the speaker—fired her eyes— made her cheeks glow with the tempestuous blood that coursed through her veins with the fierce rush of a stream that no longer knows its limits—but offered no interruption to her accents, while her feet traversed the little floor of the cabin, with every sentence which she uttered, arrested only at the close of each when she stopped to confront the hearer with her flashing eyes. “Madam,” said Jones, when her pause suggested to him an opportunity for reply, “what will you have me say or do? I am commanded to obey you.” “Yet forbidden to answer my questions.” “No, madam, only on such subjects as concern the movements of the beagles.” “Ay, that is the pretence. You know that I care to know nothing of your movements, or of any movements which merely affect your schemes of plunder, and when I would ask of him, I am answered by a reference to your oath. What has your oath to do with his movements?” “He is one of us—his movements are those of the beagles.” “You will not answer me, Mr. Jones?” “Madam, are you not already in possession of all the information which I can give you?” said Jones, significantly. “What mean you, sir?” “The dwarf—Stillyards.” “What of him?—Has he returned?” “He has, madam. He stood near the captain last night—so near that, had he been discovered, his life had been but little worth. Saxon would have put a bullet through his head had he known of his presence, and dreamed that he had been sent as a spy upon his actions.” “Ha! what mean you by calling him a spy—who sent him as a spy?” “You, madam, should need no answer to that question. Enough, that I know that he was present —that he was present as a spy, and may reveal to you those matters which I dare not. Stillyards is already here, if you have not seen him; and has, probably, been so far successful that he is able to answer all your questions: as he has no such scruples as myself, he probably will do so. But, let me counsel you, madam, for your own sake, no less than that of our leader, that you employ that crooked scoundrel no farther in such matters. If discovered, Saxon will kill him, and if not, he may pick up some secret of the leader, upon which his own life and the lives of all of us might depend. You do not know the evil which may follow this evil practice, for which, if you will permit me to declare, there can be no sort of necessity. Saxon, let me assure you, is as faithful to you as he is to us; and if ever mortal man loved woman, it is certain that he loves you.” “Ah, Mr. Jones,” responded the woman in milder accents, “could I be sure of this; but the feeling of my own unworthiness, is one that always produces a doubt of his fidelity; and if he loves me as you say, why is it that I am now so constantly deserted?” “Believe me, madam, it could not well be otherwise.” “Would I could believe you, Jones; would I could—but—but—no matter. You will keep my secret, Jones—you will say nothing of what you know?” “Why should I, madam?—it were of no use, 13* unless it became necessary to prevent a repetition of a practice which endangers the lives of all. Stillyards must not be again employed in this business.” “How, sir, do you command me?” “No, madam, far be it from me to do so. But I take leave to counsel you; and to add, that my own knife should silence the dwarf for ever, should I again detect him in the position in which I encountered him last night.” “Enough, sir,” replied the lady, proudly, “I shall take care that the lad encounters no such risks at your hands in future, and warn you, therefore, that I shall avenge any injury which your suspicions or your malice may prompt you to inflict upon him.” “Malice, madam!—it would be malice were I to declare to our captain what has passed between us. But you mistake me, madam, I have no malice against you, if for no other reason, because I sincerely love our leader.” “Mr. Jones,” said the lady, “I requested you to say nothing to Saxon of what you know. I now amend my request, simply to beg that you will merely give me an opportunity of anticipating your communication to him of every particular relating to the spy, as you have been pleased to call the dwarf, in my employ. It shall never be said that Florence Marbois, whatever may be her errors and her vices, dreaded to speak the truth herself in the ears of the man she loved. I may have wronged him by my suspicions—but I will not wrong him so greatly as to yield to an underling any confidence, however unimportant, which I yet withheld from him. You may leave me now, sir.” A faint smile passed over the features of Jones, as he left the apartment. “Now, were I the malignant she has called me,” he uttered in low soliloquy as he entered the woods, “I should not forgive—certainly never forget—this bitter and foolish speech. It were no difficult matter to ruin her with Saxon for ever. But what use? A woman in all her pride and glory is something like a soap-bubble after all. She glitters and floats in air for a while, is decked with all the colours of the rainbow, but you see through her all the time, and she bursts at last. I pity Florence—she has many excellent qualities, and, but for the convulsive jealousy of her temper, would be as amiable as she is lovely. She will break some day, and cover us with lather. It will be our care to see that she does not blind our eyes with the soap.” With this effort at small philosophy and smaller wit, the outlaw proceeded to the hut of the wandering actor. His place was supplied, in the presence of the lady by the dwarf, Stillyards, who made his appearance the moment after the departure of the other. He had evidently continued his occupation of the spy, and had listened to the whole conference between them. With a grin, which had in it as much malice as delight, he prefaced his revelations to the lady by some natural remarks upon what he had heard; but was surprised at receiving a rebuke for his ill-timed impertinence. “To your business, Stillyards—you saw the captain—he was well?” This question answered to her satisfaction, she dismissed him without farther inquiry, betraying, in the novel forbearance which she manifested, the influence had upon her mind by the serious caution which Jones had given her. The importance of the dwarf was in no small degree lessened by this course of proceeding. “A fool's journey, indeed,” he muttered to himself as he went, “if I'm not to use what I went for. But I'll pick a hole in both their coats when they're least a-thinking. I've a word to open madam's ears whenever I choose it, and I'll speak it too, sooner than lose my best business. The only good shares I gits comes from my lady, and if she stops hearing, she'll stop paying. Well, it'll cost 'em both a great deal more in the end; and if I don't git nothing by it, I'll git satisfaction. I'll show 'em that the broken back that makes 'em laugh, can make 'em cry too; and if I only gits my laugh for my pains—well, that's something.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER X. “And he had learn'd to love,—I know not why, For this, in such as him, seems strange of mood.” “And there was one soft breast, as hath been said, Which unto his was bound in stronger ties Than the church binds withal.” Childe Harold. Jones, when he returned to the woodland cover which had been assigned to Horsey as his sleeping apartment, discovered the worthy actor half undressed, squat upon the turf, and looking around him with a countenance in which consternation might be said to be the prevailing expression. “Why, what's the matter, Mr. Horsey?” demanded the outlaw. “Matter, sir,” returned the other, “matter enough.” “How! you seem alarmed—you seem angry.” “Not alarmed, but cursedly astounded, and, as you say, a little angry. Mr. Jones, I'm cursedly afraid that this company of yours will not exactly answer.” “How, sir?” “They lack moral, sir,” was the reply of Horsey, in lower tones, and something more of caution in his manner. “Indeed,” said the other, “what leads you to this conclusion?” “Nay, let me not do injustice to all, when the offence may be that of one only. Would you believe it, sir?—my clothes are stolen!” “Can it be possible?” “Not only possible, but true. They are gone, sir, —a tolerably new coat—blue cloth, gilt buttons, with velvet collar, and silk lining—two shirts—pants, a sort of pepper-and-salt, very fine though, with figured braid front and broad edging—vest, fine satin, a little frayed at the right pocket, double buckles in the back, no strings, and my name, written in India-ink on the lining, `Thomas Horsey, American Theatre, New Orleans,' all in full. In the vest, a silver pencil-case, ever-pointed, without leads; in the pants, a penknife, toothpick, and comb; in the coat, a handkerchief and pocket Shakspeare, fine miniature, Cadell's edition, London, much used, and with pencil-marks for reading, under emphasized passages. I would not take twenty dollars for the Shakspeare alone, to say nothing of the clothes.” “Truly a very serious loss, if they be lost,” was the reply of Jones; “but I'm in hopes, Mr. Horsey, that they are only mislaid. Our profession, as you well know, calls for persons of nice honour in particular, and I should prefer believing any mischance sooner than the dishonesty of any of our men. Have you looked where you left them?” “Every where.” “Let us look again. It is too much to lose without some effort, and you may have overlooked them in the darkness of the night. Where did you lay them?” “Here, on this very pole, and beneath these two trees; I changed my dress behind them. My saddlebags, you see, are safe, and that is fortunate, for my favourite costume, and the most costly, is within them. I have a Romeo there, sir, a Richard, two field-officers, a Mustapha, and other uncertain characters. My Hamlet, you see, I have on, and, egad, `motley's my only wear' now, unless I can recover the missing matters. The only citizen's dress I had, is gone, and I should make a comical figure by daylight, in this dress of Denmark.” “A noble figure you mean, sir—you never looked half so well in any dress in your life, Mr. Horsey, as in that,” was the reply, full of tones of admiration, which the outlaw made. It went consolingly to our actor's heart, through the medium of his vanity; and the importance of his loss became a little lessened in his eyes. “Upon my soul,” continued the outlaw, with a successful gravity of countenance, while he affected to look for the missing articles, “were I you, Mr. Horsey, I should never desire any other dress than that which you wore to-night. Your figure and general air, sir, suit admirably the costume of Hamlet.” “Do you really think so, Jones?” “Indeed I do; your carriage was particularly fine—the union of royal dignity and profound human thought, which you contrived—I know not how—to throw into the countenance of the melancholy prince, was inimitable. The habitual sense of royalty was there—present always to the sight; and yet every movement of the lips, every turn of the body, every glance of the eye, subdued while graceful, and full of signification while most easy, seemed to say, with the preacher, `Vanity of vanities, all is vanity.' Your Hamlet, sir, seemed to denote, what he must have felt always, that he was the victim of the destinies.” “That is a good idea, Mr. Jones—a devilish good idea—a correct notion of the character. I must confess I never thought that before, though, certainly, I must have felt it, if my personation was correct. I must read the play more closely,—I must renew my studies. D—n the fellow for stealing the book—the breeches he may have—can't you make it known without offending the company, Mr. Jones?—Say that the thief may have vest and breeches, returning me my Shakspeare and the coat?” The result of the search, in spite of the liberal offer which Horsey had made, was unsatisfactory. The worthy actor was compelled to wear his professional costume in common, and the merriment which his appearance by daylight occasioned among the outlaws, whom he was still persuaded to regard as brethren—fellows of the sock and buskin—may be more easily conjectured than described. Not that he himself was suffered to become conscious of the fun which he inspired. Jones had his object in preserving order, and was successful in curbing the open expression of that mirth which was felt on every side as the actor strutted among them—perhaps not so much dissatisfied with his losses, as pleased with the opportunity of appearing so often in character, to a person who, like Jones, seemed to behold his display with so much unction, and with such a laudable desire to profit by his exhibitions. It would have been easy to have kept the actor some time longer in so pleasant a captivity, had it been the object of the outlaws to have done so. It was only necessary on the part of their leader to hint a desire that the phlegmatic, yet fanciful Hamlet—a Jacques under different aspects of fortune—should become the proud and passionate Moor for a season; and Horsey, whatever might have been his rising suspicions of his companions, dismissed them on the instant that he put on the habit of Othello. Vanity is one of the most unsuspicious of all moral objects. The ear that is open only to praise seems to acquire its intense eagerness at the expense of the other perceptive faculties. The eye is closed to the sneer that lurks about the lips of irony—and a general obtuseness of the judgment, in all but the leading desire of the mind, distinguishes that moral gourmand, for whom toiling Flattery—a creature that is base in proportion to the folly which it feeds,—ministers its spurious sweets, that, perhaps, only do not satiate, because they are so utterly unsubstantial. But let us not anticipate. It will not be necessary here to say how long Horsey remained in the neighbourhood of Cane Castle, or what were the events that subsequently befel him. Let us finish with the night in which he lost his inexpressibles, and in which we have still something more to do, and some other parties to produce. After devoting considerable time, and a reasonable degree of effort, for the recovery of the lost wardrobe, Jones left the actor to his sylvan couch, while he returned to his own—a shelter of twigs, bark and bushes, some fifty yards distant. The actor soon slept, to dream of parts and persons, in the assumption of which the loss of his own garments could not have been seriously felt. Sleep soon overcame the outlaw also; and it was only after several shakes of the shoulder that the latter was awakened from his slumbers by a stranger at his side. “Ha! captain—you!” he exclaimed, when fully aroused, and starting to his feet as he distinguished the face and form of his visiter in the dim star-light. “Yes,” was the answer in the tones of Saxon. “Have you found your man?” “He is here,—we have played the game so far with tolerable success.” VOL. II. 14 “You have the clothes then?” “Yes—coat, vest and breeches.” “That is well. Let them be well blooded; put a knife and bullet hole in the breast and body, and send them off with the first peep of morning to Nawls. Keep up the game with this silly fellow a few days longer, and I will then give you orders what to do with him. He is unsuspicious of the truth?” “Quite.” “That is well—keep him so—but do not suffer yourself to be deceived. He may play in characters more troublesome to a good beagle than Othello or Macbeth. You were careful to take him along the cross paths to the swamp?” “Ay, sir—it would puzzle him to find his way out again without help; but he will not seek to do so while we hold to our theatrical purposes, and this we can safely do for a reasonable space longer. Do you leave the castle to-morrow?” “To-night. I will but see Florence first, and excuse myself for another flight.” “That is only a proper caution, sir. She needs it.” “How! Have you seen her?” demanded Saxon, with some anxiety. “She came out upon us while we were drenching the boys, in the very height of our play with the actor.” “Ha!—well! The old passion, I suppose?” inquired the outlaw, with some disquiet in his tones. “Would she were safely in Orleans again. What did she come for?” “To summon me to the castle—to make inquiries after you—your whereabouts—your objects—the cause of your delay.” “Jealous, suspicious woman!—I must cure her of this; but the task is not so easy. She has a furnace in her veins that maddens her. Her brain is all fire and suspicion, and her heart—but I must forgive her all, since her madness grows out of a love, which is as little qualified and doubtful as her jealousy. And yet, heaven keep me from such a passion as hers—to be its object even is a terror. It would consume while it worships—and still enslaves by the intensity of its regards. There is no tyranny like that which never suffers you from under its eye.” The conference between the two outlaws was continued for a brief space longer, but as it involved matters which have no connexion with our narrative, it needs no record here. When they separated, Jones resumed his couch, while Saxon, passing through the narrow pathway already traversed by the reader, entered upon that densely encircled area, on the edge of which stood the little cottage of his leman. Florence Marbois—the young, the beautiful, the devoted—was a Creole of Louisiana, whose parents were French, and who, dying of yellow fever in Orleans when she was yet a child, left her to the doubtful care of indifferent relatives, whose responsibility, however lightly it may have been felt, had been abruptly terminated by her clandestine flight to the arms of another guardian, from whose affection she had better hopes of those regards and that tenderness, which were so dear to one so adhesive as herself, and of which she had heretofore known so little. Edward Saxon—of whom she then knew nothing, but that he was noble in form, handsome in features, proud in spirit and intelligent in mind, far beyond the average of those intellects to which she had been accustomed—became her protector—her protector in that sense of the word which excludes her from all social consideration; and though it may most frequently have its origin in love, more certainly finds its termination in disgrace. She fled to his arms, and in the intoxication of a first dream of passion realised, she felt no rebukings of conscience —no compunctious visitings—no misgivings that the love which had prevailed over virtue would fail to survive its loss. But the heart which craved the affection which it has not often found, is of all others the most suspiciously watchful of that brief portion which fate allows it; and when, in process of time, the various employments of her lover, took him from her side, and kept him absent for days, and weeks, and sometimes months, Jealousy, that twin-passion of love, which, perhaps, must always be as active as its elder sister, particularly where the rights of the latter have been left unestablished by the legitimate authorities, grew no less violent than the flame of which it may be called the black and veiling smoke; and she who could dote, at one moment, with devotion, on the bosom of her seducer, soon showed him that she was not without the spirit to rise, at another, into rebellion and hostility. Her fits of passion annoyed and sometimes confounded him; and the first impulses having subsided, which had led him, as fiercely fond as herself, to assume the charge of one so wild and violent, he sighed with something of regret as he looked back to a condition of freedom, which he now craved, but which he found himself utterly unable to restore. Though outlawed, he was not utterly abandoned, and his soul shrunk from the suggestions, which had never been self-prompted before, to rid himself, by a single act of brutality, from ties which, however sweet at first, had now become an encumbrance. Now, for the first time, however, dark resolves were self-offered to his mind; and ere he emerged from the wood which separated the encampment of the robbers from the area in which the cottage of his mistress stood, he paused under their influence, and his lips parted in murmured soliloquy: “And why should it be borne longer?” he exclaimed—“why should I be the victim of eternal jealousies—a suspicion that haunts my footsteps— that watches my actions—that hangs like an incubus upon my heart? Can there be any wisdom in such patience? Shall it be that I, who have shaken off the fear with the love of man—who have bidden defiance to his power no less than to that of God—that I should yield up life and freedom—the enjoyment of other society which might in part console me for the loss of those which the outlaw must ever forfeit, in a base homage to one for whom I have no love —for whose claims, even lust now fails to offer any argument? Beautiful once—beautiful still—loving me as I believe thou hast done—Florence Marbois, thou art yet nothing in my sight. Thy love is persecution; and it is pity—pity only—which has made me, at great effort, wear a face, when I approached thee, of regard which I can no longer feel. I remember what thou wast when I first saw thee— when I first took thee in my arms that fatal night, when, in a boat which might have been a coffin to us both, the winds bore us over the Pontchartrain together—I remember what thou wast, and what I promised to thee then, and the memory of that night rises up to save thee and to soften me. But, can I always spare—can I always endure the tyranny which thy vain jealousies inflict? Is there reason why it should be borne—nay, is there not good reason now, why it should cease soon and for ever. It must—it shall! There is a bound where patience may not go—a limit where endurance stops, and forbearance becomes a shame as it has long before 14* become a weariness. That bound is reached—that limit is overpassed; and the heart which now flows with all its streams to another, must soon be freed from thee. But for this I had borne with thee still longer—I had borne with thee in pity for thy youth— for that love even, which thou still bearest to one to whom it has been an annoyance for weary months, and to whom, unless checked in season, it must become a curse!” He paused and looked around him, as if struck by approaching footsteps, but no one approached him. As if reassured, his words again broke forth in soliloquy—such soliloquy as denoted the doubts and indecision of a spirit, for the first time approaching a purpose of excessive guilt and danger. What he said tended to show that the woman whom his arts had betrayed, was about to be cast from his least regards; and nothing seemed to be wanting to the more fell and cruel resolution which would thrust her from his path, but that frequent contemplation of the subject, which reconciles the corrupted heart, step by step, to the last degree of crime. That this stage of wickedness had not yet been reached by the outlaw, was clear enough, by the frequent recurrence, in what he said, to that period in the history of their mutual fortunes, when the intercourse between them had been productive of equal pleasure to them both. So long as the memory may still look back with tenderness to the green garden spots of youth, the heart is not utterly corrupt—there is still a part not yet ossified—a narrow, isolated spot, from which the springs of relieving pity may well up and soften, though they may not often heal, the rest.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XI. “Die all my fears, And waking jealousies, which have so long Been my tormentors; there's now no suspicion.” Massinger. It was midnight, but Florence Marbois did not sleep. She sat beside the window, looking forth upon the various shadows of the night and forest. The scene was unspeakably sweet and soft, but it was also sad and mysterious. A faint murmur, like the distant moanings of a spirit at watch over the desolate abodes of youth and happiness, came to her ears through the subdued silence hanging over the scene. The shadows drooped, as if in kindred affliction, beneath the grave and brooding starlight. The gray cypresses rose up like spectres amidst the green foliage that grew thickly along the edges of the swamp, and looming forward in the dewy haze of midnight, seemed to harmonize with the melancholy aspects of the region. Nor was the voice of the water, as it rose from a brooklet that gurgled under the upbulging roots of a tree which it had partially detached from its foothold, without a fitting tone of sadness for the scene. The heart of Florence felt the mysterious sympathies accorded by the unintelligent nature at her feet. Her head rested upon her palms as she looked forth and listened—her eyes, as if satisfied, strove not to pierce the dense maze of forest all around her; and while her lips murmured a complaint of solitude, such as seemed to be the burden of all voices, her cheeks were glistening with those holy dews which such beauty as hers—had she been still alive to social vanities—should not have regretted, since they served to crown beauty with the more prevailing charm of sweetness, and consecrate to love the very sorrows in which their origin is found. The heart of Florence was softened, but not at ease. Tears had brought relief—a brief respite from the gnawing discontent which preyed upon her heart—but not a cure—not a remedy. If she felt more at ease, it was the ease of one who has just drank the soothing draught, and can only find relief while under its influence. Fancies, which are sometimes hopes disguised, the ephemeras of the soul, had been with her in momentary visitation; and, though vague, unstable, and illusive, they had at least diverted the grief which might else have overborne. True, they fly at last, but so do the angels; and who would refuse the blessing of the visit, in which the very air blossoms through which they come, because of the conviction that they must fly with the morning? The heart that has been full of sorrow, should be the last to speculate upon the always unprofitable future. Unfortunately, the hopes of Florence had not been wise, hopes, for they had not been good ones. She loved unworthily—she had sinned—she lacked the securities of virtue, and had no confidence in that of others. Her hopes, based upon the probable truth of her lover, were idly founded. They were made to rest upon his tastes, his passions, her own powers of pleasing, her frail and fading charms, and her undisguised attachment for him. They had not been placed where, to be secure, all affections must be placed; upon her own just claims to respect, and upon the inflexible principles of truth in the man to whom her affections had been given. He had raised his hand in defiance to society, in the rigid exercise of whose laws the only security of woman may be found; and her appeal for justice now lay to his passions and caprices alone—to passions which constant provocation made active and imperious—to caprices that fluctuated with an appetite more peevish with every indulgence, and more recklessly resolved with every denial. But Florence Marbois was a creature of impulses, not of thought; and if there were moments in which she estimated correctly her miserable condition of dependence, such thoughts were soon driven away as intruders, by the gentle accent, the kindly solicitude—not often shown in the latter days of her heart's history— which the pity of her betrayer vouchsafed to bestow, in return for that increasing homage and devoted love—shown even in its most jealous phrensies— which she had never ceased to feel for him from the first hour of their ill-appointed union. And, sitting beside the window of that rude hovel, alone, in the deep mazes of an uncultivated forest— the savage almost at her side—a band of outlaws at her feet—midnight gathering, vague, wild, indistinct and mysterious around her:—the playmates of youth —the friends of maturity—the social and kindly world in which she had lived—all banished from her sight—all lost, and, probably, lost for ever:—still she thought of no privation—she knew of no loss—she dreamed of no evil—no danger—nothing to make her doubt—nothing to make her dread—she thought only of him! Where was he? When would he come? Was he still true? Did he still love her as before? Could she have found a grateful answer to these questions, her heart might have been pacified. She would have asked no other questions—no other fortune from the hands of Fate. Such is love —that thing of greatest dependence—of greatest strength and weakness. Strong above all powers for endurance—weak beyond all moral supports, when it knows not where to confide, and cannot command the sympathy which it ever seeks, and without which it is little better than a flower cast upon the unreturning waters, and borne with feeble struggles to the wide ocean, where it is swallowed up. Strong, vigorous, climbing, triumphant, and beautiful, like the vine, when the gigantic tree suffers its embraces; but wretched, sinking, and perishing, prostrate upon the earth, when, throwing out its tendril-arms for the support to which it was destined, and without which it cannot live, it grasps only the unsubstantial air; and perishes at last in feeble despondency upon the damp and noisome ground from which it has ever sought to rise. In the cold world how many affections spread forth their arms, seeking, but in vain, to clasp themselves around the rugged nature which they would adorn and beautify—failing in this, that perish upon the spot which gave them birth but denied them sustenance—putting forth no fruits, bearing no flowers, yet beautiful while they lived—so beautiful in promise, that the heart cannot help but weep, for its own sake, that they were denied all fruition. The tears were yet on the cheeks of Florence when Saxon entered the apartment. He entered it unobserved. Her face was yet turned upon the forest—her thoughts were far distant; and in the absence of her thoughts, her present senses had become obtuse, or heedless of their duty. He strode firmly, but not heavily, over the room, but she heard him not. He stood almost immediately behind her, and still she turned not. He stood awhile surveying her in silence. Many and changing thoughts seemed passing through his mind. His brow darkened for an instant—his hand was lifted in the same time, and seemed searching in his bosom, while a glance of savage ferocity lightened in his eye. At that moment a deep sigh escaped from her lips, and the expression passed from his face, his hand was withdrawn from his bosom, and, placing it upon her shoulder, he pronounced her name. She turned, almost with a scream—an exclamation which had in it as much delight as surprise—and, rising from her seat, threw herself into his arms with all the abandonment of joy. “Oh, Edward, dear Edward,—it is you—you are come,—you are come at last, and I am so happy. But you have been gone so long,—so very long, Edward, that I feared you had forgotten me—that you had deserted me for ever, and my heart sank within me, and I have been so miserable that I wished myself dead a thousand times—indeed, I did—for it seemed to me far better to be dead and cease to feel than to have such miserable feelings as have filled my heart. But you are come now—you will now stay with me a long time, and I shall be so happy.” While the poor heart-dependent hung upon the bosom of the outlaw, and poured forth these words in a stream that lacked emphasis as it lacked obstruction—for the sentences which she so rapidly uttered were spoken without the cessation of the smallest pauses—his looks were cold, his eye was aimless, his whole air and manner were those of a man who could no longer be moved by any thing that she might say. His head was thrown back to avoid the flowing tresses of her hair which brushed his face, and his arms made a slight movement to put her from him. This she felt—this she resisted, and clung to him with a firmer hold than before. “Do not push me from you, Edward—not yet— not awhile,—let me cling to you only a little longer. I have thought upon this dear embrace, and wept and prayed for it so long that you must not deny it to me now. Yet I will not worry and vex you with it. I know you have grown colder and harsher than you were—that you are not so fond as you used to be when we first came to the woods. I feel that—I know it; forgive me that I press it upon you—but remember I am a woman, and believe me that I love you, oh, Edward, as warmly as ever, in spite of all the changes which I cannot but see in you.” “It may be so, Florence—it may be so,” replied the other coldly. “It may be so, Edward—may be so? Can you doubt it—can you think otherwise for a single moment? Have you not seen it in all my looks—have you not felt it in all my actions—from the first to the last—from that sweet,—perhaps, most unhappy hour, when I believed all your assurances of love, and gave you, oh, how entirely! all of mine—even to this, when you speak as if you believed me not, and look, as if you are indifferent whether it is truth or not which I speak? Do not force me to think this, dear Edward—do not, I implore you,—unless you seek to discard me—to crush me quite—to trample me for ever in the dust. I can bear the world's scorn—nay, I do not see—I do not feel it. I can bear any thing—all things,—denial, privation —banishment from friends and family,—burial in these swamps—any thing but the conviction that he, for whose sake I am thus desolate—thus dependant—now makes light of the sacrifice, and takes from me, all at once, that love which I found more than a recompense for every loss. Turn not from me, Edward—speak not,—look not so again upon me, for in truth, I am very, very wretched—I know not well why, unless it is that I see so little of you. And unless you smile upon me—unless you are willing to let me love you when you come to me—I would rather far that I were dead—I would rather far that you would kill me with a sudden blow and end all my sufferings at once. The pang of the blow, even from your hands, given in your anger, would not be half so great a pang as that which I should suffer without mitigation and without cure, could I feel that you were indifferent to my love.” The imploring solicitude of this speech—the tender accents—all failed to move the now cold heart of the outlaw. He suffered her hand to rest upon his arm—but his eyes turned away from the large, tear-filled orbs that implored more eloquently for his love, than any of her accents. He had not yet attained that recklessness of spirit and of conscience which could enable him to meet without shrinking, the glance of her, whom he was not unwilling to destroy. “Florence,” he replied,—“either I have, or I have not, to go elsewhere, and be absent from you long. If such be the necessity, you have no reason to complain of me; and if there be no such necessity, then there is no policy in your complaint. Indeed, you will only drive me away from you by such complainings. I hate such scenes.” “Edward,” returned the other, reproachfully. He proceeded with an air of dogged determination, to push his new-formed resolution to the utmost. “The best regards in the world may become oppressive. There is a season for love as for other things. When a man has reached the age of thirty, VOL. II. 15 life has other businesses besides love. It is surprising that you have not discovered this truth before— that you should need now to be informed, that, even with the most pliable men, there are certain moods and dispositions of the mind when love is an intruder, and the embrace of the most lovely woman, an annoyance. I do not profess to be of more tender stuff than other people, and I confess to you that I hate very much to be continually excruciated!” And this was the end of passion! Of a passion that had seemed more like phrensy than feeling— more like the outporuings of a heart convulsed by its emotions into madness, than the ebullitions of human hopes, fears and fancies. And this was the man who had persuaded Florence Marbois to give up all—hope, honour, society—friends and family, and fly with him into the wilderness—to share with him his shame and guilt, his exposure and isolation. Verily, there is no sting—no sorrow—greater than the wrong of the beloved one—the desertion of him in whom we had put our bosom's trust! This was the first time that the unhappy Florence had ever been compelled to listen to language so unequivocal from the lips of her betrayer. It has been said already that, up to the present moment, a sense of pity, rather than of justice, had prevented the outlaw from showing the indifference which he felt. Hitherto, he had made an effort to exhibit a fondness which he had long since ceased to feel. A new passion for another, made him anxious to cast off a connexion which had become an encumbrance; and the desire which had almost moved him to the commission of a more brutal, if not a worse crime than that of his first wrong to the unhappy woman—if insufficient as yet to reconcile him to her murder—was quite active enough to render him unscrupulous to the open declaration of those true feelings which he had only successfully disguised, because of her unwillingness to behold and to believe them. His tones and language now, no longer to be mistaken, were instantaneous in their effects. She started from his side—her hand shrunk from the arm which it had grasped, as if there had been danger in the contact, and she retreated for a few paces, then stood with arms drooping at her side, and her head slightly bent towards him. Her eyes, no longer suffused, became, on a sudden, keen, arid and burning. They shot forth an intense glare—an expression of mingled consternation and inquiry; and, when they encountered only the cold inflexible gaze of one from whom all motives to farther deception were removed—who now, perhaps, rather sought an occasion to declare the indifference which a better feeling had once made him studious to conceal—it was then that they became fixed, as it were, with a death-like distension of orb, such as betokens the first bound to madness of an oppressed brain and overpowered reason. A brief space of time elapsed, in which she preserved this posture without speaking. Her intensity of stare was painful to the outlaw, even if he no longer felt it to be reproachful; and he advanced, speaking as he did so, towards his unhappy victim. “Come, come, Florence, I must not suffer this. These arts must no longer be practised upon me. Let us understand each other. Let us put an end to these follies. We have both of us lived too long in the world, not to feel the wear and tear of such passions as these; and the impolicy of indulging them should be known to all who have discovered, as I have long since done, that our affections and sympathies, to be grateful and worth preserving, must not be suffered to become tyrannies. Do you understand me, Florence?” He approached her as he spoke—he made a show of taking her hand, but she retreated, drawing her arms behind her as she did so, but preserving, at the same time, the same searching scrutiny of gaze which he had found so painfully oppressive. “No! no! no!” she exclaimed, mutteringly, a moment after. “It cannot be. It was a dream. I could have heard no such accents from his lips. It cannot be that I am reserved for so dreadful a punishment. I know that I have done wrong—that I am guilty before man—guilty in the sight of heaven—but oh! not to him! He cannot have spoken thus—I will not—dare not—believe it!” She paused, her eye still followed his, and, unwilling to endure its expression, he turned away to the window she had left. A new resolve entered her mind—she darted rapidly towards him—caught his wrist with a nervous grasp, and spoke in clear, soft, untremulous accents— “Edward—Edward Saxon—what was it that you said to me but now—not a minute since?—Speak! —Speak aloud—let me hear your words again, for I feel that I have not clearly understood them—I hear badly, Edward, of late, and, unless the words are spoken very distinctly, I am very apt to misunderstand them.” “Florence, why do you annoy me in this way when I come to see you? You know that I hate these wild passions. These tumults that produce no good, and are without any necessity. They trouble—they oppress me—nay, more, I confess the truth to you—they make me exceedingly reluctant to approach you.” “It is true! It is all true!—my ears did not deceive me—I heard it all—all!” she exclaimed, breathing deeply, after several protracted moments in which her bosom seemed not to heave—her lips gave forth not the slightest respiration. Her eyes were fixed upon him with a gaze of mingled horror and surprise, and, more than once, as she gazed, her hands were passed over her brows, as if striving to put aside some obscuring tresses, which were yet not in the way. Well might she doubt her sight, when she could no longer withstand the evidence of her other senses. The now desolate and abandoned woman— abandoned by the man for whom she had long since abandoned virtue—had still a hope that there might be some smile on the lips of the speaker—some expression in his eyes, softening, subduing, qualifying, disarming the deadly accents which had reached her from his lips. But no! In his cold, calm features, she beheld most truly the hopelessness of her heart. She saw that she was for ever banished from those affections, in which she deemed herself secure. The veil, with which pity had striven for awhile to hide from the eyes of passion, the fatal truth, that love had for ever gone from the shrine where he had been worshipped, was ruthlessly torn away; and the mocking spectre alone remained, to grin over the devotee, who had for so long a season bent before its unholy and delusive features. The sin which had assumed the aspects of a power the most commanding of all others in the heart of woman, having secured its victim, beyond recall or recovery, no longer cared to preserve its disguises, and she stood alone in the presence of the tempter, his veil uplifted, his scorn openly declared. Florence Marbois, weak though she had been at first, and easy, like all her sex, to be overcome where she loved and believed herself to be beloved, had yet her strength; and the strength of woman, defrauded of her hope, and despised in her affections, is no less immeasurable than fearful. The cold composure of the outlaw's glance moved her indignation, 15* and a bitter smile of equal scorn flushed the face that a moment before had been of a deadly whiteness. “I thank you, Edward Saxon—I thank you. Cruel as the truth is which you have at last spoken, it is some consolation that it is the truth. You have deceived me for a long time; and in this practice my own blind attachment has made the toil of artifice an easy one. But your looks tell me more than your language; and there are other truths, yet unspoken, which I need not that you should declare. Edward Saxon, you love another! I know it—I feel it—else why should you now forego the deception, so long continued, and which you found so easy? Why should you teach me with such effort—so plainly—that you had ceased to love me, when it cost so little effort to persuade me that you did, and when such a faith was so grateful—so essential—to the poor heart that loved you. You are not naturally cruel, why then be guilty of so great a cruelty? —why open my dreaming eyes to the loss of all for which I had lived? There could be but one reason —but a single motive. From the moment that you fixed your eyes upon another, the task had become irksome of continuing those shows of love to me on which I have fed so long. There was no absolute need to wear a mask any longer—you had nothing to hope, and, in the excess of your power, you, perhaps, felt assured that there was nothing which you had to fear. Perhaps not! Edward Saxon, you are free. You shall hear no farther reproaches from Florence Marbois. Devote yourself to the hapless woman whom you have selected to fill my place. You may never discard her—she may never suffer my wrongs—and yet, if she is unlike me, perhaps she may avenge them. Enough—you are free to seek her. Though my heart withered, and my hope died, yet, I tell you, Edward Saxon, they should do so, sooner than I would implore you for the delay of a single instant ere you cast yourself into her arms; or for a single accent of reluctant love, from lips which have been so dishonoured as yours.” “Florence, this is a sort of madness to which your constant jealousies have long made you liable. They have annoyed me long enough,—they shall annoy me no longer—and since you so boldly declare yourself—now learn from me, that your conjecture is true. There is another—a woman, loveliest among the lovely—you shall see her—she shall even dwell with you here for a season—though I say not that she shall take your place.” “Wherefore not say it? Think not you will offend me farther, Edward Saxon—think not you offend me at all. I tell you, my heart has survived the possibility of offence at your hands. You have wronged me too deeply to offend me. I see not your scorn—I hear not your accents of coldness and cruelty—they are lost in the overwhelming conviction of the injury which you have done me. You are a bold man, Edward Saxon,—a bold, brave, bad man. I am but a woman—a frail, feeble, desolate, abandoned woman—” She paused. “There is something more, Florence. Why do you stop? Surely the comparison demands an inference—a conclusion—a point. Shall it be a sting?” She looked on the speaker, whose contemptuous smile showed how little he valued the feelings which he had so deeply outraged, with a grave countenance, expressing a singular degree of composure, which, but for the feelings that it really served to hide, must have been unnatural; and replied briefly— “It may be so—bold, bad, reckless as you are, Edward Saxon,—worthless as am I, and feeble—God will raise me up an avenger. I may be guilty in his sight, but it cannot be that you, to whom I owe it all, should be suffered this double triumph over me. There will be an hour of retribution. There must be pangs for the betrayer as well as for the betrayed; and I will only pray that I may live long enough to know that you feel them.” “The prayer of the wicked, you know,” was the sneering reply of the outlaw. “I could preach you a sermon from that text, Florence, were I in the mood, which would be unctuous enough for the orthodox in any congregation in Mississippi; but I spare you that, and my farther presence. I must leave you for a while. I trust to find you in a better humour when I bring you a companion.” “Now, may I have strength for my vengeance against that day!” was the exclamation of the discarded woman, as the outlaw left her; and a wild, cruel resolution rose up in her mind, as, brooding without sleep through the remainder of that weary night, she thought only and ever of the woman who was destined to take her place in the embraces of unlawful love, as of a victim!—the last sacrifice upon that altar of passion, on which her own virtue had been the first.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XII. “I'll no more tender him, Than had a wolf stol'n to my teat in the night, And robb'd me of my milk.” John Webster. Saxon knew, in fact, but little of the nature of woman. Her heart was a fountain shut up, and a book sealed to him. He had the arts which could win —these, perhaps, are few and not difficult of attainment. They may be acquired by almost every youth of tolerable deportment and moderate common sense. But those finer arts which may secure the possession, and make the conquest permanent, he did not seem to possess, and, indeed, did not seem to value. Men who are rapid in their conquests, are not apt to value them. “Easy won, easy lost,” is something of a proverb, which holds no less good in the affairs of the heart than in those of the purse. Had Saxon been a more thorough examiner of that various province,—the heart of a woman who loves;—could he have looked deeply into its hopes and fears,—its tumultuous passions, and capricious fancies—its suspicions, which grow naturally out of a just feeling of its dependance upon that arbitrary lord whom it is born to serve and must suspect,—and which make it a thing all watchfulness and jealousy;—he would have known that there was no object in nature so sensitive—no object so perfectly fearful,—when touched rudely by reproach, or mocked by indifference and scorn. Perhaps, had he not grown too indifferent to the possession, he would have been more considerate of the claims of that affection which he once sought with avidity, and which was never more truly and devotedly his than at the very moment when he encountered it with a contumely as reckless as it was underserved. He little knew the fierce and uncontrollable spirit which he roused in the bosom of Florence Marbois during the brief interview which has been just recorded. She might have forgiven the neglect which was only suspected —she might have forgotten the partial inattention of his regards, so long as he still returned, and while his lips still yielded, however unfaithfully, some vague assurances of his attachment. But when he boldly declared his defection—when the vain beauty was taught to know that there was a more highly esteemed beauty, set up as her rival;—when the devoted heart was rudely thrust from the altar, where its tendrils were still resolute to cling,—when love could no longer doubt its desertion—it was then that another and a wilder nature, rose up, gloomy and terrible, within her soul. Some glimpses of this nature had been shown the outlaw a moment ere their parting, but he had not seen them. These had been the outbreakings of a spirit which could not altogether be suppressed; but its language was beyond his comprehension. He had heard so many upbraidings from the lips of the neglected woman that his ear had grown obtuse to their true signification. He confounded the vindictive mutterings of a passion which was scorned, with the tender reproaches of a heart which was still allowed to hope. Having denied hope, having trampled upon love, having cast faith and feeling from his consideration,—he should have known that Hate would be the deity most likely to be raised upon their ruins, by the spirit which he had so rudely driven from all communion with his own. There is quite as little wisdom as virtue in injustice. Perhaps it may be affirmed, with equal truth and certainty, that it is also without cunning. The wholesomest moral prudence is truth and good faith. Had Saxon not been blinded by his resolution to do wrong, he must have seen, in the keen yet composed glance of the woman—in her deliberate accents—in her slow, cold, resolved manner—that a sudden and singular change had come over all her feelings in the moment when he made his open avowal of injustice. Her temper, passionate and deep, earnest, and gushing—overflowing in its fulness, and always warm in its expression in all ordinary cases of excitement—was now, when the occasion became one, perhaps, of the greatest and most painful provocation, suddenly subdued—almost frigid—an embodiment, in marble, of lofty elevation and dignified indifference. The change in character should have occasioned surprise; and reflection should have taught the outlaw, that the woman he had wronged had become an object of apprehension. But he had none. He was too glad of an occasion to shake off bonds which had become irksome, to see that, in doing so, he had incurred the resentment of a heart which could be as dangerous as it had been devoted. This sudden obtuseness of intellect may be accounted an essential part of that blindness and madness to which the gods deliver over those whom they have previously determined to destroy. Florence Marbois watched at her window while the night faded away; yet she seemed utterly unconscious of its passing hours. She was unconscious of all things around her. Her heart was changed within her, and bitter thoughts and envenomed resolutions were growing up, and taking the place of those which, but a short time before, had been only those of tenderness and love. The cruel iron of desertion, and the sharp steel of scorn, had entered deeply into her soul, and left nothing but rankling irritation where they went. Desolation she had endured for him—but desertion by him was unendurable; and wild, vague, changing, but always hostile measures presented themselves to her mind, as she brooded, in the darkness and stillness of the night, over her wrongs, and the bitter-sweet hope which she indulged of redressing them. “There are means,” she murmured at intervals, “there must be means every where provided to humble the oppressor—to revenge the injured. I am weak—I am woman—but God has not left me utterly helpless, if he has made me destitute. I know that I can have my revenge—I know that I can strike—that I can triumph;—and here—here in the darkness of this hour, and in the presence of such spirits of evil or of good—I care not which— as travel the eternal realms of space, I swear that, sleeping or waking, my prayer, my dream, my desire—my only study, as it is my only hope—shall be in what way to revenge my wrong—to bring this proud, insolent man to the dust—to deprive him of those joys of which he has for ever deprived me!” By what means she hoped to effect her object, may not even be conjectured in this early stage of her resolution; but no one could have hearkened to the tone of her accents, or beheld the fixed expression of decision in her eyes, and reject the conviction that she was as solemnly sworn to her revenge, as if the demons of the air whom she invoked as witnesses, had received and registered the oath. They did so; and it may be that, ministers of justice, no less than of evil, they wrought in behalf of the deserted leman of the outlaw, when the ordinary powers of society would have failed, and the laws would still have been, as they had ever been before, objects of scorn and mockery to the reckless spirit who had so long held them in defiance. But let us not anticipate. In leaving her that night, he also left the encampment to which had been given the ambitious title of Cane Castle. Another brief conference with his coadjutor, Jones—that dexterous agent, who had so successfully entrapped and deceived the unwary actor—by which he was provided with final instructions for the future dispensations of that unconscious worthy; and then the outlaw sped off to those other performances, which have been already narrated, and which ended in the arrest of Harry Vernon. The next day rose upon Horsey, still as Hamlet. The grave habit of the Prince of Denmark was that which, in all his wardrobe, came nearest to the guise of a simple citizen; and half reconciled to the costume in character, from a pleasant conviction which the flatteries of Jones encouraged, that he looked a marvellous proper man in it, the worthy actor renewed the search after his ordinary garments with something more of equanimity than he had shown on the preceding night. Still, he did not hesitate to speak of the robbery in proper terms. “The mere loss of the clothes is nothing, Jones,” said he, “but that we have thieves in the company is most shocking. There must be a stir about it—the rogue must be found out, and we must purge ourselves of the connexion as soon as possible. Our profession is one quite too noble for any such communion.” VOL. II. 16 Jones fully agreed with him that it was shocking indeed; but suggested the difficulty of finding out the thief, and the awkwardness of any direct inquiries. It was agreed upon, that their conduct was to be governed by circumstances; and, meanwhile, a sharp look-out was to be maintained upon the movements of all suspicious persons;—Jones confessing that there were some two or three of the band whom he really believed to be no better than they should be. “Now, that bull-headed fellow, Bull, I take to be one of these suspicious persons,” said the actor, remembering the annoyances of the previous night; “a fellow that gets drunk and makes a beast of himself, will be very apt to steal. Don't you think so, Jones?” “I do,” replied the other, very courteously. “As a general rule, Mr. Horsey, a drunkard is bad enough to be a thief; but there are exceptions to all general rules, and Bull is one of them. He's a genius, Mr. Horsey, as I said before—an immense genius. You may see nothing of it for some days; but he'll break out at last, and overwhelm you. He's the very impersonation of fun, farce, and frolic.” “But the heroine, Jones—sha'n't I have a talk with her to-day? It's strange that all your firstrates should be so eccentric.” “Natural enough—they all know their value. You would not think it strange, when you know them as I do, and know the extent of their popularity.” “And what do you call her—what's her name?” “Her name?—oh, yes—her name's Clifford— Mrs. Clifford—Mrs. Ellen Clifford—she's married, you know I told you, and—another reason why you should be cautious in approaching her, and why she should be devilish shy of all third persons—her husband's worse than a Turk for jealousy. He flames up, like a rocket, on the smallest occasions. Nay, it is said he gave a poor fellow three inches of his bowie-knife in Natchy, only for praising her beauty off the stage. You see she's very beautiful.” “What a d—d fool. Egad, I'd like no better fun than just to plague such a fellow; and if you had no other reason than his jealousy to keep me from looking her up, I'd be at her in twenty minutes. Can't you get me a chance to talk with her. I'd like to see what sort of stuff she's made of.” “Time enough to-morrow. Let us go now and see after the boys. We have a boat here on the bayou—a little dug-out—and, if you say so, we'll take our fishing-tackle, and get some fish. Fishing here is our most profitable idleness, as, indeed, it is every where else; and, if you like it half so much as I do, you will not think much of the manager's absence.” “But my Hamlet!” exclaimed the actor, looking at the costly garment. “Such a dress as this, Jones, won't do for every day. The d—d strange-looking green and yellow mud of this river—the water, if I'm splashed—will play the very d—l with my Hamlet.” “Won't splash you,” said Jones, hurrying along. “I'm like a bird in a boat—can't be said to dip a wing, even when I take my fish. I handle a dug-out, Mr. Horsey—not to compare low things to high—with almost as much grace as you do the foils in Hamlet. But come on—fear nothing, and if we get no fish, why, you can give us the grave scene, which shall make our time pass with less gravity.” The last suggestion was the finishing stroke, and Horsey followed without farther opposition, though not without sundry misgivings that his sables might suffer some hurts much too serious for any smoothing or stitching, even from hands so white and dextrous as those of Mary Stinson. Many a compunctious glance did he give to his inexpressibles as he went forward, following his cunning confederate through bog, bush and briar, until they reached the muddy mouth of the narrow creek where lay the egg-like skiff which was to bear the twain to the main trunk of the Chitta-Loosa. Here they embarked in the trembling fabric, the heart of Horsey rising to his throat, with every roll and reel of the frail vessel; while his eyes, drawn by a natural attraction to the banks, surveyed, with momently increasing disquiet, the yellowish slime upon their surface; the soft miry ooze of which seemed for all the world as if it were intended to receive with close embrace and a most yielding compliance, the pressure of any derelict body, the waif or tribute of the slow and turbid river which had left it where it lay. But that which disturbed the composure of the actor had no effect upon his companion. His muscular arms sent the little dug-out through the narrow passage, with a dexterity no less prompt than fearless, and Horsey had not drawn a second breath, before the boat quivered upon its centre, and hung suspended for a moment in its course, as, leaving the sluggish canal through which it had emerged, it felt the downward rush of the main current, in its restless passage to the Mississippi. Florence Marbois, as soon as she discovered that Jones had left the island—a knowledge obtained without difficulty by one who was so well served as the lady in question—immediately went forth from her little habitation to a spot, the path to which seemed familiar, where she found the dwarf Stillyards, busy mending his nets. He stood up as he beheld her, with an air of deference in his manner, which he was not wont to show to all other persons. “Richard,” she said, “I have need of you again: are you ready?” “Soon will be, ma'am—have nothing to do but tie a few threads, and lay a draw-cord through the end-loops of the net. This hole here would let a dozen jacks through; and there's not a suckfish in Big Black that wouldn't laugh at this for gill-tackle.” “Richard,” continued the lady, in tones at once of command and entreaty—“put by your net for the present,—I would speak with you.” The foot of the dwarf turned the net over a low bush; his hands would have done it more effectually, but his vanity was unwilling that he should stoop, in the sight of a lady, to a performance, in which his physical deformities became only the more conspicuous. His manner the while was that of the most respectful deference. He declared himself ready at that instant to obey her commands, and made some rude assurances of his great willingness at all times to do her service. “I know it, Richard,—I know that you have always served me faithfully,—and believe that you will continue to do so in this, probably, the last task which I shall ever give you again.” “Ma'am! Heh—what?” She did not seem to heed the interruption or the exclamation, but proceeded: “You have kept my secrets, Richard, and always made, I have good reason to believe, a faithful report of what you saw. Here is some money for you. It is more than I promised you, but not more than you deserve, and not near so much as you shall have when you have done for me another service, and as I said, most probably, the last.” 16* “The last, ma'am?” “Yes, Richard, my fears will be soon at an end,” replied the lady—“she should surely cease to fear, who has at length ceased to hope.” The dwarf looked up, wondering more at the looks and accents of the speaker, than at the words she uttered. She continued: “Did you know that Saxon was here last night?” He nodded assent. “He went before daylight,” continued the lady. “He went from me for ever—we are no longer one, —we are parted,—parted for ever.” The dwarf grinned, but not with any pleasure. The expression of his face was that of good-natured incredulity. “You smile,—you believe me not, Richard.” “Ah, ma'am Florence,—how can I believe you —you know how often you've said the same thing. Every time you've sent me to look after him.” A faint smile passed over the lady's lips as she listened. “You are only right to doubt, Richard. I have indeed too often spoken only, when I should have performed. I will not seek now, by any new assurances, to make you believe my present resolution. Whether you believe or not—whether he believes—is of little importance to either of us now. But there's some difference of circumstances, Richard, of which you may have no knowledge. Hitherto, I may have done him wrong by my suspicions— now I can do him none. Last night he told me that he loved another.” “He!” “Ay, he! Edward Saxon, for whom I gave up all—friends, family, good life, good name—hope, truth and innocence! He has forgotten the sacrifice, which, indeed, I too had forgotten so long as he loved me. But that is over, and I am now lost to him as I have been so long lost to all. I have nothing now left me but to die.” “Nothing, ma'am Florence, nothing! Sure—” “Ay, there is something, Richard—there is something more. It is a woman's feeling, Richard, to desire some knowledge of her rival—to desire to see her, to know if she is beautiful, to hear her speak, and hearken if her accents be sweet; and, perhaps,—but I need not say more of this to you, Richard.” “Oh, yes, ma'am Florence—I beg you do.” “No, no!” was the rather stern reply. “It needs not. It was only of another feeling—they call it a woman's feeling too—that I would have spoken—that I would gratify. But here it shall remain—secret from you—secret from all—doubly sweet to myself that it is so secret!—until the blessed day, which shall enable me to realise my last hope —the hope of—” The word was unspoken, but the vindictive gleaming of the eye, and the convulsive quiver of her lips while she shut them together, as if to prevent utterance, were sufficiently conclusive that “revenge” was the only word which could have properly finished the sentence. Her heart heaved with the suppressed secret—her hand was clenched, and for a moment she stood gazing on the dwarf with an expression of face, which almost startled him with a feeling of personal apprehension. “Richard—you must follow Saxon—once more you must follow him. Find out where he goes— whom he seeks. Look not on her—so that you may not be won by her beauty also, to betray the poor Florence,—then come to me—come back and get your reward. You shall have money and jewels—all the jewels and money that I have, Richard—they will almost make you rich; but you must be sure and tell me where he hides her—when he brings her here, and how soon I may look upon the woman whose feet have trodden upon my heart. Go! let me hear your horse's tread immediately. Away, Richard, sleep not as you go—God be with me and strengthen me, for well I know, I shall never sleep till you return—even if I sleep then. Away!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XIII. “I do pronounce him in that very shape He shall appear in proof.” Henry VIII. The dwarf listened to the commands of his mistress, and prepared to obey them. He had been accustomed to do so; indeed, it may as well be stated in this place that Richard Stillyards, as he was called, was rather an attendant of Florence Marbois, than of the outlaw by whom she was betrayed. What were the particular circumstances by which he became bound to her service, may not here be known; but it has been seen that there were events and performances by which she had deserved his gratitude; and his devotion to her service showed that he was not unwilling to give it. He had been faithful to her for a long period; obeying her slightest and her strangest behest; ministering, perhaps harmfully at times, to her jealousies of the outlaw, though without seeking to encourage them; for Stillyards, so far, had been able to discover no single instance of a departure from his pledged faith to his leman on the part of Edward Saxon; and he now regarded the bitter rather than the angry mood of his mistress, by which she declared her renewed suspicions, as being equally without foundation with all which she had entertained before. But though he assured her of this conviction, his assurances were made in vain; and he was sagacious enough to perceive that her present disquiet was of a character which she had not before exhibited. Hitherto, she had shown a vague jealousy—a general but uncertain suspicion—of the truth of one upon whom she felt she had none of those holds, which can alone be found in a compliance with the established laws of virtue and society. There was hostility now, and hate, mingled with her suspicions; and the very calmness which overspread her features, and which regulated and made deliberate the tremulous accents of her voice as she spoke, convinced him that, whether she had or had not occasion for her anger, it was yet of a kind to prove dangerous. Stillyards was not so bound to Florence Marbois, as to lend himself to all her purposes; as to become the mere tool and agent of a rash and improvident vengeance; and while he prepared, without scruple, to set forth in obedience to her commands, he half-resolved that Saxon should have warning that his mistress was no longer to be trifled with. Still, with a partial curiosity, he resolved first to discover, if he could, whether the outlaw was really unfaithful to his vows—an assertion made with so much solemnity now, by the deserted woman, as to impress itself upon his mind with some force, in spite of his constant conviction heretofore, that she had but little reason for complaint. His purpose was to counsel the outlaw, if such were the case, to greater prudence in his declarations and proceedings; and, tickling his own vanity with the patronizing idea of being an adviser to the master beagle of the band, he saw but little harm in practising a like unfaithfulness with his master towards the mistress whom he served. These resolutions passed through his mind as he proceeded upon his mission. He soon got upon the track of the outlaw, and followed him to Lucchesa, where he arrived in time to become privy to the position of Vernon in the house of Mr. Wilson, and that of Saxon in reference to his daughter. He was soon convinced that the story of Florence was not without foundation. For the first time, he beheld the reckless outlaw in the character of a devoted, if not a sighing lover. He saw that the affair was rapidly advancing to a close, and on the afternoon of the day when Vernon was hurried from his mistress by the self-created officers of justice, he availed himself of an opportunity to emerge from his cover and present himself boldly before the outlaw. The place chosen for this revelation, was a thick copse in the very wood in which the final scene had taken place between Vernon and the maiden. To this copse Saxon had retired after he had witnessed the successful termination of one portion of his projects. Stillyards had been equally fortunate in beholding the events which we have already described, and he was, therefore, very well able to speak home upon the subject. While Saxon, seated upon a fallen poplar, was busy chewing the cud of various thought—thought no less perplexing in some respects than it was exulting in others; and while his eyes, fixed upon the ground, saw no image but that drawn by his amorous fancy upon the warm glass of his affections, he was suddenly and unpleasantly startled into a new sphere of existence by the abrupt appearance of the dwarf at his side. “How now, sirrah!—What make you here?” he demanded in harshest accents, as he beheld the intruder. With a grin of equal consequence and humility the dwarf replied— “She sent me—she's heard it, sir—heard it all— knows all about it, sir, and it's only right, sir, you should know, it won't do to vex her;—she's angry as a tiger-cat—looks as if she could bite and do a great deal of mischief; and though she don't say, yet I can see, and I thought it only right to let you know, and to warn you, sir—there's danger—danger in her eye—” “What the devil do you mean, fool!” demanded the outlaw, with an impatience momently increasing, as he beheld the airs of self-esteem which now distinguished the manner of the speaker. “Fool!” cried the other, with a vexatious diminution of his importance; “fool! Not so great a fool neither, if you knew all.” “All!—what all? What is it that your sagacious head carries, that it is fitting I should know? Speak out, booby, and leave off your damnable faces.” This startling, and most humiliating reception, effectually turned the sweet milk of the dwarf's disposition, and a burning sentiment of indignation in his bosom, made him wish he had left things to themselves, confined himself to the old system of espionage, and suffered the revengeful mood of his mistress to work its own way, without offering any obstructions to its progress. It was necessary, however, that he should now speak, and to some purpose, in order to account for that obtrusion of his ungainly person, upon the secrecy of one who seemed in such excellent temper to resent it. It may readily be conjectured that what he did say, in the momentary confusion of his thoughts from such a reception, was scarcely satisfactory. “You don't know, perhaps, sir, that she sent me.” “Pshaw! you are a spy upon my actions—you have long been so, booby. Do you think me ignorant of that? Her folly and your stupidity have taught me this long ago, and but that you could do me no harm, and that I care as little for your cunning as for her jealousy, I had stretched you out straighter with a bullet than you have ever been able to stretch yourself. Begone, fool—she is no less a fool that sends you. Cross my path—lurk about my footsteps—let me but catch a glance of your monkey visage again where it should not be, and I silence you for ever. Begone!—But—remember!” With these words the outlaw rose, and seizing the dwarf by the ears, sunk his finger-nail into the flesh until the blood oozed out from the wound, then flung him from him with a force that needed not the additional impetus given by his foot, which was yet applied with no qualified energy. The violence of the effort flung the deformed upon the ground, from which he sprang to his feet with the agility of a tiger. He turned upon his assailant—his eyes glared with the vindictive and unreflecting rage of the same animal—and his unarmed fingers were extended, as if endued with an instinct of their own, to grapple with the foe. But the eye of the outlaw quelled the inferior, and a pistol which he drew from his bosom, effectually counselled him to increase the distance between them. Slowly he sank from sight into the neighbouring woods, from which, however, he did not then depart. The watch which he had hitherto kept over the movements of the outlaw, on account of his mistress, was now maintained on his own account. The malice which is the fruit of outraged self-esteem, is that which is the last to forgive its victim; and when Stillyards crept into the woods, it was with the stealthy mood of the wild beast to which we have already likened him—the appetite which never knows repose until it gorges the full feast from the very lifeblood of its prey. Saxon had some lurking doubts that he had provoked an evil spirit into activity, and though his apprehensions were kept down by that scorn of the feeble and deformed VOL. II. 17 which the strong and proud are very apt to feel, yet a momentary conviction of the necessity of curbing or crushing such a spirit in the beginning, persuaded him, the moment that Stillyards had disappeared from sight, to pursue him. This he did, but without effect. His search was fruitless. A creature so active as the dwarf, who could crouch with so little effort, and conceal himself in places into which other men could not penetrate, could not well be discovered, unless with his own consent; and hopeless of a search which was no less tiresome than fruitless, he left his unprofitable quest in the prosecution of others far more attractive. That evening, Saxon, who had sundry agents at work, succeeded in getting Mr. Wilson to the hotel, and safely seating him, with three others, at a game of whist. Without knowing the history of this unfortunate gentleman, which would have given the outlaw a very desirable power over him, the latter had yet been able to discover that leading passion of the other, which had led him from folly to excess, and from excess, by a very common transition, to crime. He saw, in the eager anxiety of the stranger when engaged at cards, in his flushed cheek, fitful eye, and tremulous impatience, the peculiar material out of which the devoted gamester is made. That passion for small risks,—that pleasure in a hope of gain that rises up into a feverish sentiment in spite of every defeat, and goes on renewing itself day after day, till the very dregs of moral life are reached, and the carcass becomes a thing of spasmodic and convulsive action, without stability or strength—was there, preying upon and predominant in the soul of Wilson, and renewing those bonds of slavishness and sin, in the coercive trammels of which he had sunk, first into the debtor, and next into the felon—from deep to deep—until but one more gulf—the closing covering gulf of all remained—yielding him refuge and utter ruin at the same moment in its unrelaxing jaws.—It was not long before Wilson surrendered himself up to the game; and when his tens, twenties, and hundreds lay upon the board, and when his hands touched the cards with a tremulousness that betrayed all the reviving passions of his feeble nature, leaving him no thought of other objects or relations, Saxon stole away from the company, unseen by any but the lynx-eyed dwarf, who, himself unobserved, was now a far more devoted spy upon the actions of his master than he had ever shown himself before. His own bitter hostility was now his prompter in addition to the jealousy of his mistress; and, he half forgot, in pursuing his own malice, that he had pledged himself to any other service. He followed the outlaw from the threshold, and was the master of all his movements. But a brief space had elapsed after the departure of Saxon, when a billet was put into the hands of Virginia Wilson. She was sitting, sad and sleepless, keeping a watch doubly lonesome and apprehensive in the absence of her father, to whose errors she could not be altogether blind, in the stillness and silence of her chamber. The younger sister already slept in the couch beside which she sat, and her own loneliness grew more oppressive to her heart as she listened to the sweet, equal respiration from her lips—the breathing of that undisturbed sleep of innocence and youth, ere care has deemed it worthy of a blow, or defeated hope, and anxious affection, brought restlessness and wakefulness to its hours of repose. How she envied the child that sleep. How she wished she could forget—that she could close her mind as easily as she could close her eyes, to the apprehensions which beset her soul in reference to the fortunes of him, who already occupied so large a place in its interests and being. The billet which was brought her, came from him. That assurance aroused her. She seized it with trembling hands and breathless anxiety. She carried it to the light and read: “I am free, dearest Virginia—but a fugitive. I dare not show myself at your dwelling. I dare not, at this moment, show myself to any but to you. Will you come to me—though for an instant only. Come to me, if you love me—if you have faith in my love—if you believe in my innocence—if you would make me happy at a time when I am most miserable—meet me by the fallen pine—under those old groves—in the dear sweet walks which have been already consecrated to our hearts by moments which were too blissful to have been so brief. I wait for you, dearest Virginia—my heart trembles with impatient hope. Vernon.” Vernon would not have written such a letter; but Virginia Wilson was no critic. Her own feelings were too quick, too active, too excited, to suffer her judgment to examine the epistle calmly. Her heart beat with new emotions. What could be his present danger? Why should he be a fugitive? Was he, in truth, a murderer—could he have slain his friend by accident? She had his own assurances that he had not done so, and she believed them. But there was still a mystery, and doubts, to the heart that loves, are agonies. There was but one mode to escape them; and though not insensible to the awkwardness of a situation which in ordinary cases would seem to be an impropriety, she determined on giving him the meeting which he craved. Leaving or entering her chamber, she had been accustomed to kiss her sister. The custom was a sweet one. They had been almost the all in all, and the only, to each other. Nevertheless, there were circumstances and causes, which, in spite of the real tenderness of the father, made Virginia not unfrequently feel that they were almost fatherless also; and now, when bending over the sleeping girl, and pressing her lips gently upon her cheek, the tears, few but big, fell from her eyes, and trembled upon the forehead of the sleeper, like dew drops, in a summer moonlight, beading the soft crimson of the half-opening flower. But tears, though not unseemly on the cheeks of so fair a blossom, yet appeared to the mind of Virginia as of evil omen. She kissed them off with the haste of a maternal anxiety, and hurried from the chamber. There was none to obstruct her departure, for the indulgence of her father had left her the complete mistress of his household. She hurried by the garden pale, the forest groves were soon reached—the well known shadows of old trees surrounded her, and now the fallen pine tree appears, and she stands in the presence of— Edward Saxon!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">17* CHAPTER XIV. “The innocency lost, The bating of affection soon will follow.” Ben Jonson. Though the shadows were thick around her, and the evening light of the moon imperfect, the keen eyes of love soon discovered the difference between the man she met, and he whom she expected. She recoiled with a natural emotion of surprise, but did not feel any suspicions that the appearance of Saxon in that spot was the result of any sinister design. He might be the trusted friend of Vernon on this occasion, as he had always appeared hitherto— but where was Vernon? She looked round anxiously, but without a single doubt of his near neighbourhood, until the outlaw approached and addressed her— “You look for Mr. Vernon, Miss Wilson—but I come from him. He has told me all—I am his friend —he has sent me to bring you to him.” “But where is he, sir? He should have met me here—here—it was so written in the note.” “Did not the note also tell you, Miss Wilson, that he is a fugitive? He has need, let me assure you, of every precaution. He is in danger—he dare not show himself.” “You alarm me, sir. What may this mean— what is his danger?” “He has escaped from the officers—they are even now in pursuit of him!” “Escaped!—Can it be? But why should he escape, if innocent?—Why? But he is here!—Here! At hand—within hearing. You are his friend—and I!—What can he fear from me?—Why should he not come forward? My voice shall re-assure him— when he hears me, he will know that there is no danger here. Vernon! Vernon!” Twice she called aloud, and waited for the answering sounds that she desired. But her summons was made in vain. A faint echo of her own accents alone reached her ears. The outlaw stood patiently and smiled, but did not speak until her eyes were turned inquiringly upon him again. “He does not hear you, Miss Wilson—he cannot hear you at this distance; yet it is not far where he hides. I can guide you to the spot in a few minutes.” “And why should he not come here, Mr. Saxon? Who, beside ourselves, know that he is near us?— But, perhaps, you can tell me more, but you will not. He has been pursued—he is hurt—wounded in escaping!—Speak, sir—speak—fear not my strength —l can listen—I can bear it all.” “You have guessed rightly, Miss Wilson, though I feared to tell you,” replied the outlaw, promptly availing himself of the suggestion which her fears had made; “he is hurt, but not seriously—he awaits you at a little distance, and I am ready to guide you to him.” There was a moment's hesitation about the maiden; not that she doubted as to what should be her duty—not that she had any doubt of the truth of Saxon's narrative; but the requisition had been so sudden, the event so unexpected, which required her presence, that her sense of propriety had been startled—her thoughts were all in confusion. The wily outlaw conjectured the true state of her feelings. “Am I to think you indifferent to his fate, Miss Wilson? His hurts require—” “Indifferent! Oh, no! no! no!—but these woods look so wild—and you, Mr. Saxon, are a stranger.” “But if he confides, Miss Wilson.” “It should be—it is enough for me. I will confide also. I will go with you. Lead me to him, Mr. Saxon, I have no scruples now.” He took her arm within his own, and led her along a little Indian foot-trail, which carried them over the hill, and still deeper into the shadows of the forest. The heart of Virginia Wilson beat with momently rising, but unexpressed emotions, as the way became more intricate, and as she perceived that every step carried her still farther from the cottage. Still she went on, anxiously expecting to hear the sounds of that voice which alone could re-assure her. But the woods were silent, and the only murmur which reached her ears, was that of the melancholy pilgrim, the wind, pursuing his sleepless way among the branches. At length they emerged into a little opening, and Saxon paused, as if to listen. “Is he not here, Mr. Saxon? We are far from the cottage.” “Not here—a few steps farther;” and he would have advanced, as he spoke, to a dark and dense grove in front of them, but the maiden hung back. There was something in the reserve of Saxon— something in his manner—which made her reluctant to commit herself longer to his charge, and inclined her to regret that she had already trusted him. Besides, the reflection was so natural to a mind conscious of its own good faith, why had he deceived her, when she had declared her willingness to go with him? They had now been walking full fifteen minutes, yet saw no signs of the person who had been described as immediately at hand. “I will go no farther, sir—I dare not. If Mr. Vernon be not within hearing now, I can advance no farther. I am afraid I have already erred in leaving home.” “It is too late now to think of this, Virginia—too late to retreat,” exclaimed the outlaw, throwing off his disguises, and grasping her wrist firmly as he spoke—“you must go with me.” “Ha, sir!—will you dare?” “Ay, much—every thing, where I love—where there is a prize to be won so lovely as yourself. You must go with me—you must be mine, Virginia.” As he spoke, his arms encircled her waist, and she felt herself lifted from the ground. “Monster—villain—release me!” screamed the maiden, with a voice of equal indignation and terror—“Vernon! Vernon! come to me! Save me!” “You scream in vain, Virginia. I have deceived you. Vernon is not near—not within hearing—the billet which brought you to my arms was a forged one. But be not angry. You have found a lover who will be no less true—no less devoted than himself—one who is no less willing, and far more able to serve you with his love. The life of Vernon is forfeit to the laws.” “God help me! God help him! Villain! I believe you not. He will soon be here. He will follow—he will save me. Beware of his anger, and his vengeance!” “Ah! Virginia, if you but knew how little I regard these threatenings, and of how little value they really are, you would surely forbear them. Why should you thus afflict yourself and me. I suffer only as I see you give yourself fatigue and pain. Your screams are idle. In these pathless forests, there is none to hear you, unless it be the wild cat, who, if the humour suits, will give you scream for scream.” “Yes, villain—there are others nigh to save me. Men are nigh. I hear the tread of a horse—I hear the voices of men. They come—they come! It is Vernon—it is my father. They come to save me. They will avenge this insult. Set me down, and fly! Do this! Release me on the instant, and I will tell them nothing of the outrage.” The outlaw laughed aloud as he listened to this language. “The men you hear are those whom I have commanded here to assist me. The horses they bring will help to bear us away together. They will carry us, sweet Virginia, to a place of retreat which neither father nor lover can find out. Do you hear that sound?—it is that of the beagle—when I have answered it in like manner, they will be here. Hark!” And, as he finished, the outlaw replied to the signal in a clear, ringing note, which rose triumphant even above the piercing shriek of despair and terror with which she accompanied it. In a few moments after, the agents of the outlaw, guided by his answer, approached the spot, where the maiden, still struggling and shrieking, was held by the firm grasp of the ravisher. His assistants were three in number. One was mounted—the other two on foot. “Where is the jersey?” demanded the outlaw. “On the edge of the wood—we couldn't get it through the brush,” was the answer. “Enough—lead the way.” “Shall I help you, captain?” “No, no! Clear the way only,” replied the powerful ruffian, lifting the maiden, while he spoke, as if she were a child, and bearing her forward, indifferent alike to screams and struggles, threats and entreaties, until he reached the spot where the vehicle had been left. Into this she was placed, with all tenderness, but no little difficulty, and leaping in beside her, Saxon secured her within his arms, while one of his emissaries, occupying the front seat, assumed the office of Jehu on the occasion, and drove off with as reckless and rapid a speed, as ever did that renowned whip of ancient days. Their course was for Cane Castle, in the swamp of Chitta-Loosa. They drove round Lucchesa, avoiding the thoroughfare with some caution at the first. After a little while, they turned into it, and before midnight, the carriage came to a halt with the thickening ooze of the swamp plashing clammily about its wheels. Before this time, exhaustion had come to the relief of the unhappy maiden, and when she was lifted from the vehicle, she was in a state of utter unconsciousness and stupor. Jones, the wary coadjutor of the outlaw, was at hand ready to receive him. “Well, Jones, we are here in safety, and all is as we could wish it. What of Florence? We must have her help here.” “Can you think of it, sir?” demanded the other, with some astonishment. “Can you hope for such a thing from her?” “Ay, this or any thing as I please, my good fellow. I command her—she is mine—my slave, as thoroughly bound to my service as if the bond were written with her blood. Her love for me—the very passion which works her jealousy to madness—is my best security for her devotion and her service. Think nothing of her grumbling, Jones—I have heard it too often to hearken to it now. A kind word—a soothing entreaty,—and all's over. She will forgive the rival, when she can share the conquest.” “I hardly think it, sir, with Florence. There's something I don't like in her eyes, and the way she speaks. She's changed very much these three days.” “Jones, you're a fool. You know nothing of women, my good fellow, or you'd not give yourself such troublesome notions; certainly you would not afflict me with them. Florence is not different from all the rest. She will have her own way if she can, and when she finds that impossible, she will content herself with all that you are willing to allow her.” “But the two in the same house,” said Jones, in a tone of farther expostulation. “And with one man between 'em!” continued the outlaw, with a laugh. “But let this not trouble you, Jones. They shall be kept apart. There's the squatter's cabin by the Little Bend—to that I will carry Virginia. Florence shall see her there—she will need some assistance.” “Better keep them entirely apart. If the young lady needs help—female help—there's Brown Bess you know.” “What is she here—and Yarbers? How's this?” “Your orders, I hear. There's a warrant out against John Yarbers from old Badger. Ned Mabry's sworn against him about that horse business.” “True, true—I had forgotten that. Bess is the very person to be with her. Let us have help now, Jones, so that we may carry her safely through the swamp. The river's rising—is it not?” “Considerably—there must have been a heavy fall of rain among the hills above.” “And when did Yarbers arrive?” “It's been four days now and better. He got in on Monday.” “Not pursued?” “Not that he told me.” “Cane Castle, must look a little livelier than ever; —and how does your Shakspearean reconcile himself to his bondage. What of the actor-fellow— have you been able to keep up the ball?” There was some hesitation in the reply of Jones, and his accents were those of a man conscious, perhaps, of some fault of commission or neglect. “I'm sorry to say, sir—he's off.” “Off! How off? You don't mean to say escaped, heh?” “Fact, sir—and how, there's no saying at present. I had him well watched, as I thought.” The tidings had the effect of making the outlaw instantly grave. His accents became stern. “This is a bad business, Jones. Can there be traitors among us? Another Hurdis affair! This must be seen to, man. We are not secure an instant if we cannot see our prisoner. But you pursued— you have beagles on the track. What have you done—how was it? Speak! By heavens, you are a duller fellow than I counted you.” “I can really say nothing, sir, as to the manner of the escape. The chap was safe enough so late as this morning.” “The d—l, and so he got off in broad daylight?” Jones gave a mortified assent, and was compelled to submit in silence to the severe upbraidings of his principal, whose reproaches did not lack sarcasm to heighten their severity. “By heavens, Jones, but I thought you more of a man than this speaks for. With five active fellows in the swamp—all at your summons—with nothing to do but this—you suffer yourself to sleep in your watch, and neglect every thing. Did the fellow go off on foot?” Here Jones was compelled to make another confession VOL. II. 18 which completed the story of his inefficient watch. Horsey had contrived to resume possession of old Bowline—his worthy father's venerable “dot-and-go-one.” “Worse and worse!” exclaimed the other. “There's treachery somewhere. We must sift the matter closely. Yarbers, you say is here—his wife and daughter. Ha! Jones—that woman—that wife of his—Brown Bess is at the bottom of it all. She is shameless enough to be more honest than her husband, and will no doubt think it a moral duty to hang us all if she can, and him, for distinction sake, at the head of the string. Well—we must use her now. Away, and let Yarbers bring her to Little Bend at once. I will meet you at Cane Castle in half an hour. Say nothing to Florence of my arrival—nay, do you avoid seeing her. I will tell her all myself. Away!” But Florence had not been left uninformed on any of these subjects. She had, as we have seen, her own emissaries at work, and the dwarf had not only beheld the transfer of the captive maiden from the wagon to the squatter's house at Little Bend, but he had listened to every word of the dialogue between the outlaw and his agent, which had accompanied and followed her removal, and which we have endeavoured in the preceding passages to abridge to our own limits. He delivered his information to his jealous mistress some time before Saxon made his appearance. “She's here,” said he to Florence, as he stood suddenly before her where she sat in the gloom and silence of that lonely chamber, looking out upon the solemn swamp. It was in the same chamber that we found her first, when far other thoughts filled her mind, and far other feelings dwelt in her bosom, than those which rule over them now—making the one wild and the other wretched. She started as she heard his accents—she rose from her chair and approached him. “You do not say it, Richard!” she said, with a solemn tremulousness of accent. “You do not tell me, that she is indeed here—that he has dared!” The dwarf nodded his head ere he spoke, then answered her. “At the squatter's old cabin, by the Little Bend.” “So near!” was the exclamation of the unhappy Florence, as she walked to the window and looked out—though, through the dense woods, her eyes could distinguish nothing in the direction of the designated hovel. She turned again, after lingering a moment, and approached the emissary. “Richard—you have served me faithfully, and one of the last acts of my life shall be to reward you. But tell me—have you seen her. Is she so very beautiful?” “Very beautiful they say—though I don't care much to see beautiful people, and didn't look much at her.” “But you saw her?” “Couldn't help it—saw her a'most every day since I left you. I always followed him, and he went to her every day, and they walked out sometimes in the woods.” “Ha! ha! They walked out in the woods, did they; and she is very fond of him, I suppose? They are well matched—very well matched—a loving couple, Richard? Did you not think them so? But, do not answer me now. Go, Richard—leave me now—I would rather be alone.” “Look you, ma'am—there's one thing,” said the dwarf, lingering—“If you think this strange gal's fond of Saxon, you're altogether out. She aint fond of him no how. She don't like him. He put her in the jarsey by main force, and she screamed and made a mighty fuss.” “Ha! Is this true?” demanded Florence, with considerable interest. “P'int blank truth. I saw her fighting him, and you might hear her screech for more than a mile— that you might—afore she fainted.” “What!—she fainted?” “Died off, like 'twas all over with her, and didn't move ag'in, till they lifted her to carry her to the squatter's house.” “Richard, are you sure of this? Speak nothing but the truth—you know not how much depends on this,” said Florence, with solemnity. “I'll take Bible oath to it, ma'am. I'll kiss the book to it. There's no mistake in me this time, I tell you.” “Enough!” she said, waving him, with her hand, to depart. “Enough! I thank you, Richard—I will reward you in the morning. Leave me now.” When he had gone, she returned to the window. “This makes a difference,” she said, musingly— “a great difference. If true, she is already a wretched victim, and no blow of mine would do her harm. Yet, even if she be a willing creature of his lust—if he find in her, what he found in me—a weak heart, a yielding nature, a confiding faith, that loved blindly and weakly, and was lost, before it became conscious that there was any thing to lose—still, why should she be the victim even then? She knows not that she wrongs another—she does not—but he—he who knows all—who wilfully wrongs, and scornfully defies, he—but he is here—it is he who should feel the blow. It is his heart, and his only, which my hand should strike. And it shall strike. I am sworn to this. Lost—an outcast from all hope, all life, all love—I am not so base, so worthless, or so weak, that I cannot strike for vengeance. No! Edward Saxon—you have dared to scorn the heart which you once implored—to insult that womanly pride which you once solicited!—and yet, it lives—it lives to strengthen my arm and resolution—it lives, and will not cease to live, until you are humbled in the dust. For this triumph, and in this hope, I live only. Besides this, what is there in life to live for now;— and when he falls, there is nothing then that I shall even care to hate! God of Heaven, how strange it is to me now, that I once should have loved this man—and so loved him—he, who stood over me but a few days ago, and mocked me with the story of his devotion to another; and bade me do her bidding, and commanded me not as a slave only, but as a slave whom he despised! Ha!—It is his footstep—he comes—he comes to renew his mockery. I should not meet him unprepared.” She went, as she spoke, to a little dressing-case, and, lifting the upper compartment, drew from beneath it a small silver-hilted dagger, which she concealed in her bosom, then, turning to the entrance of the chamber, encountered her betrayer with a smile.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">18* CHAPTER XV. “Observe this creature here, my honoured lords, A woman of a most prodigious spirit.” John Webster. He also smiled as he appeared in sight, but smiled in such a sort as to add fervour to her resolution. There was a recklessness in the scorn which he now betrayed to the woman he had once loved, which was certainly as impolitic as ungenerous; but having discarded his mask, Saxon seemed anxious to show how ill-favoured had been the aspect he had concealed beneath it. He was obtuse enough not to see that the feelings he had trampled had risen up in indignation. He was blind enough to mistake the smile upon her lips for a return of her former feelings of devotion. So it is, that the wisest of men will err at those moments when they need all their wisdom. Sagacious beyond most men of his sphere and neighbourhood—particularly conversant, according to his own notion, with women, he was yet deceived, without effort, by one with whom his communion had begun by his own successful deceptions. She had been won in a moment—by a word!—how idle to think that there were depths in her mind which he could not sound, that there were feelings written in her features which he could not read. Such was the case. The cunning man was at fault. There was that in the bosom of Florence Marbois, which he could neither sound nor see; but it was written that he should be blind in this, as in other matters. She had been the victim of her blindness—it was just, for the sake of retribution, that he should have his moment of blindness also. “Perhaps you believed me not, Florence, when I spoke to you last; but I spoke nothing but the truth. She is here—here in the swamp, beside you—the woman whom I now love—your rival—your successor.” It was thus he spoke, in the language of mockery. Her eyes met his glance unshrinkingly. Her cheeks were pale—very pale—for a single instant. In the next moment they were flushed with a redness which did not depart throughout the whole of their conference. Her reply was uttered in tones of calmness which surprised her seducer. He knew not where she got the strength for such equability—he knew not the deep, dark sources of her present consolation. “You mistake, Edward Saxon. I believed you. If I were a vain woman, it might be some gratification to me to know that my frequent and previous jealousies—idle as they were in some respects—were yet not unfounded. I rightly judged your character. My passions have not been wholly blind—they were always capable of the task—perhaps, not a difficult one—of estimating yours. I know you now, in that matter, to be what I then believed you. If I erred in my conjectures, I have already borne my punishment. The time for error and regret, so far as you are interested, is for ever past with me.” “I am glad of it, upon my soul—very glad of it. You speak now like a reasonable woman, Florence, and I think the better of you. Now that I find you so calm and sensible, I am free to speak to you with more confidence. You must have discovered by this time, as I have done, that these early notions of love, that so mislead the dreaming girl and the desiring boy, are only so many masks of passion— masks under which the considerate nature disguises those tumultuous phrensies which might terrify the young from the paths of pleasure and true enjoyment, much more frequently than they could ever entice or gratify. As the experience grows, the mask ceases to be necessary or even useful. It is then that we cast it aside as an incumbrance which, in fact, impedes possession and qualifies delight. I'm sure, Florence, we shall enjoy ourselves much more by understanding these things correctly.” A faint smile covered her lips as she answered— “At least, it is quite as well that we should think so—that I should think so. With the conviction that all is lost, a resignation to one's poverty is no less becoming than necessary. But do you only come to tell me this, Edward Saxon? Have you not some other purpose? I knew all this before.” “To say truth, Florence—I came to try you. To see if you had got over that madness that used to possess you in your days of jealousy—” “And which it gave you pleasure to see.” “Not so. It vexed—it worried me to bear with your complaints—to listen to your harsh reproaches —to hear your unfounded suspicions.” “But they were not unfounded.” “Till now they were. If I was ever true to woman, Florence, I have been true to you till now. Never had I thought to wander from you, till I met with her.” “And she—she has a name!” exclaimed Florence, with something more of curiosity and interest in her looks and language. “If I am to yield my place to another—if I am to be deprived of that for which I have been so well content hitherto to live, at least, let me know something of her who rises on my ruin? She is beautiful—that I know—that you have told me—but her name? Who is she—what is her family—where did you find her?” “All in good time, Florence;—but you do me wrong, and yourself wrong. She takes no place of yours—she only shares it—and now that you show so calm a temper on the subject, let me tell you that you have risen greatly in my favour. This is the condition of mind to which I would have brought you years ago, if I could. It is the only condition of mind which would make either of us happy. I am one of those men who are always apt to resent and fly from an effort to restrain my liberty. My heart must share the freedom of my limbs, and that sort of exacting love which suffers no exercise to my eyes, my thoughts, my actions, is, of all others, so tyrannous a bondage, that, to confess a truth to you, Florence, you became hateful to me when you began to exercise it.” “Ha! Hateful!” “It is true—too true. But do not understand me, Florence, as applying to you any such epithet, now. This resignation on your part to my will, places you in a very favourable position; and if you keep in this mood, there can be no good reason, why we should not be to each other as before. Let it be understood, that I am to do as I please, and feel as I please, and go where I please, without having that d—d hunchback at my heels, and without being compelled to hearken to the perpetual growlings of suspicion and complaint,—and nobody could love you better than myself; and if you will only promise me to yield to my wishes—to haunt me no more with your jealousy, and pursue me no more with irksome reproaches—” “Be sure, Edward Saxon, I never will,” said the unhappy woman, with solemnity. “Jealousy of you will never more fill the heart of Florence Marbois —reproaches will never reach your ears from her lips. I have seen the folly of such conduct.” “Why, Florence, this is wisdom. We shall do well after this; and you can bear now to behold me in the arms of Virginia.” “Virginia! is that her name?” asked Florence, with a continued effort at calmness, which, had the outlaw been studiously observant, would never have concealed the tremulous curiosity that filled the heart of the speaker. “It is a sweet name, Florence, but not so sweet as herself. But you shall see her with your own eyes. You shall behold her charms, if you are willing and can keep down your jealousy—if you can still continue unmoved—if you will not hate her.” “Hate her! I hate her? Why should I hate her, Edward Saxon? In what has she wronged me? No! no! I will not hate her—I cannot.” “Well, this is the right temper. By heavens, Florence, but you are wondrously changed for the better within a week. But will you love her, Florence? You should—she is so beautiful, so gentle, and will make you so excellent a companion.” “I cannot promise that until I know—” The speaker stopped abruptly. “Know what, Florence?” “Does she love you?” The more obvious signification of this question was grateful to the outlaw's vanity. He laughed aloud, as he replied— “Ah, traitor! what would you have? Suppose I tell you, that she does not love me.” “You jest with me.” “Gad, I know not that, Florence. I don't know whether I can say with safety, that she does love me.” “How then came she here?” “Hum!—I brought her; and, to tell you the truth, not altogether with her own consent. But I doubt if her opposition was earnest, Florence. Like most women—like yourself, Florence—she probably hides the real sentiment under the disguise of one which she does not truly feel. There was no small portion of this sort of trickery in yourself, Florence, when we first met—when we used to meet by the lake— the little lake—” “Remind me not, I pray you,” said the outcast woman, with a sternness of accent that caused the outlaw to gaze at her in suspicious silence for several seconds. With a countenance only half assured, he proceeded: “Florence, I half suspect you now. I doubt you are only striving at composure. Your jealousies are returning, and the old reproaches will be renewed—” “Never! Edward Saxon, never! Before heaven I swear that I can never reproach you again; and as for jealousy—” “Enough! I am too willing to believe you to insist upon too many assurances.” The outlaw did not see the contemptuous scorn upon the lips which concluded fitly the unspoken sentence. “I can be happy with you, Florence—nay, I could have been happy with contented with you all along, but that your unwise suspicions and goading jealousies drove me from your side, and made me not only indifferent to your society but anxious to escape it. Now that you have grown wiser, I trust that no such necessity will again prevail to make either of us less happy, than we should and may be. With Virginia and yourself—” “But, if she loves you not?” said Florence, coldly. “I have not said it, Florence; nay—I am not willing to say, and still less to believe it. True, I brought her with less willingness on her part than I should have desired to see; but now that she is here —in my power—at my mercy—she will see—her own common sense—” “Edward Saxon! you surely mean no violence to the girl?” “Why, Florence!” exclaimed the outlaw, as he read the horror in her countenance, which was not wanting to the accents of her voice. “Do you think it so hard to persuade the maiden, that I am as proper a man as she could find among a thousand? She, I doubt not, will be as flexible as yourself, when the season comes. Nay, have I not told you already, that I look upon her reluctance as nothing more than that disguise which women naturally put on to hide their real sentiments. She will love me quite as well as another, when she has paid those due sacrifices to false delicacy which form a part of the social religion of the sex. You are all alike, Florence—all alike. Virginia, like yourself, will go through the various stages of passion—first, a pretty fear, that woos you to pursue while it only affects to fly; then a yielding gust of tenderness, that is all tears for a season—then a glow of greater delight—the intoxication of new passion, which is all smiles and burning blushes—then comes the deliberate devotion—then, the jealousy, Florence—the jealousy—which is as certain as the upward progress of the sparks; and, until this stage is over, no peace for either party. Then, as in your case again, and as I rejoice to behold it now, the quiet calm of love, which is resolved to take it on the easiest terms—to suppose it nothing but what it should be, and believe, with the poet, in love, as in the case of higher destinies, that `whatever is, is right.' You can't conceive, my dear Florence, how much I am rejoiced by the change in you.” “I'm very glad of it,” was the reply. “We shall be as happy in the swamp as if the world was in our grasp. With Virginia on one hand, and you, Florence, on the other—satisfied as you both should be, that the heart of a man is capacious enough for both—I could pass my days, I think, without any sentiment but that of contented enjoyment, and my nights with no other dreams than those of security and bliss. You have read, Florence—nay, you have heard and seen something of those gay rovers of the gulf—that were kings upon its billows, and, fierce in war—as fierce as its own storms—were yet as peaceful as its hours of calm, when they surrendered themselves, upon the green palm-covered island, to the embraces of beauty—lying beneath the shade of the plantain and the fig, and, with lip to lip, and heart, melting as it were, into the dissolving sweetness of the mutual heart, they gave up life to the sweet delirium—the pleasant repose—the happy confidence of love. Shall we not have these joys again, Florence? No storms, no fear, no scolding, no caprices—nay, turn not away, my girl—forget that there have been words or looks of unkindness between us. Now, that you have come to a right understanding of what should be the condition of our ties, there can be no cause of discontent or strife hereafter. A kiss, a sweet embrace, dear Florence, in token that there is peace between us.” As these words were spoken, he drew nigh to the VOL. II. 19 woman, whose face had been partially averted while he spoke. A tempest was in her heart the while, and a vexing commotion and a burning heat within her brain. Her hand trembled within her bosom, that trembled also with a degree of emotion which shook her whole frame. Meanwhile, the outlaw, utterly deceived by her deportment, and, perhaps, quite as much deceived by his own desires on the subject—pleased to find her so easily reconciled, and beholding her now, in this alteration of her mood, with something like the renewal of an ancient sentiment—intoxicated no less with the warm fancies which he had been breathing in her ears—approached her, and, passing his arm suddenly about her waist, drew her towards his bosom. “Yes, dear Florence,” he continued, “let this embrace renew the pleasures of the past, and this kiss be the token that all unkindness is forgotten, and there is nothing now but peace between us.” A shadder passed over her frame as she felt his arm encircle her—for a moment she seemed desirous to shrink from his embrace; but, in another instant, turning as if to requite it, she suddenly extricated one of her arms, which she threw behind her as she exclaimed— “Ay, Edward Saxon, peace it shall be, but it shall be the peace of death. Take this!—this! Let this be the token of my forgiveness. This for my wrong. This to the heart that could not value the sole, the worshipping devotion of such a heart as mine.” She struck as she spoke with the little dagger which she had concealed within her bosom. Twice, thrice she struck, and for a moment the outlaw spoke not—moved not. Astonishment seemed to possess and overcome his faculties. But when she had given the third blow, he threw her from his arms with a violence that sent her against the opposite wall; where she stood, glaring upon him like a tigress, her eyes starting from their orbs with an expression of mingled hate and horror. But Saxon fell not—he seemed not even to be hurt. He advanced to her without discomposure or irregularity of step, yet every blow had been planted by the hand of the most determined hostility upon his heart. “Your arm is feebler than your soul, Florence Marbois, else had your hateful purpose been accomplished. Woman, how have you deceived me!” She lifted the dagger again as he approached her, but, as it met her eyes, she flung the worthless weapon from her hand with a scream that denoted the disappointed fury in her bosom. The steel, small and slender, having met with the resistance of a button when she struck, had yielded and curled up at the contact, without penetrating more deeply than his outer garment. He was utterly unharmed. “Florence, you are mad,” was the remark of Saxon. “This attempt—” “Ay, man, monster, villain,—I am mad. But who has maddened me—who has driven me to this? I am doubly mad that I have failed in what I have sought to do. Feeble hand—worthless steel! But why stand you looking on me, Edward Saxon?— Will you not kill?—Here, I am ready—my heart is open—my bosom is bared to the blow. Strike, and strike quickly—it is your only chance—for I have sworn, Edward Saxon—sworn by heaven and by hell—by all powers that may yield me power for revenge—that the world shall not contain us both— that one of us must die. I am ready now, Edward Saxon!—I would not live—I hate you too much to breathe with you the same atmosphere of life. Strike! strike! You would have given me peace just now—it is not too late! I wish no other.” With a desperate hand she tore open the vest which covered her bosom, and the white realm— still so full of beauty and sweetness, if not of innocence and love—those heaving hills on which his head had so often rested in other days—lay bare before his sight. He turned from them without a word. The picture reminded even his cold and careless bosom too warmly of that past, in which his betrayal of her love had so amply justified her present hate. “I leave you, Florence—I leave you and forgive you.” He said no more as he parted from her presence, leaving her where she stood—her hair dishevelled, her bosom bare, her eyes wild like those of the maniac, but her ear too dull to hear his last words,—her thoughts any where but where they should be, and her whole brain in the wildest commotion.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XVI. “How's this? Let me look better on't: a contract? A contract sealed and ratified.” Beaumont and Fletcher. No sooner had Saxon disappeared from the apartment, than it was entered by the emissary, Stillyards. This indefatigable urchin had maintained beneath the eaves his habitual practices, and his keen senses had suffered nothing to escape him of the scene which has been just described. Florence beheld not his entrance. Her eyes were open, but, like those of Lady Macbeth, “their sense was shut.” He coolly proceeded across the room, and took up the dagger. With a curious grin of equal scorn and merriment, he examined the worthless instrument which had so amusingly failed to serve the purposes of vengeance. While thus engaged, the returning consciousness of the woman apprised her of his presence. She rapidly crossed the intervening boards that separated them. She grasped his arm with one hand, while with the other, she repossessed herself of the ineffective, but handsome weapon. This she hurled from the window, with a laugh of bitterness that seemed a fitting and mocking commentary upon her own unperforming endeavour. “Ha! ha! ha! So—you have seen it all, Richard? 19* Weak hand, and worthless steel! Ha! ha! ha! did it make you laugh? No! and why not? He laughed? Did he not? Did you not see him laugh? He laughs now—now! Well he may laugh! What a fool am I—I that am wronged and ruined—dishonoured, scorned, abused, and deserted. What a fool am I to dream of justice—to think that there could be vengeance for the lone and feeble woman. To think that a weak arm like mine, should avenge my weaker heart.” And, as she uttered these wild and passionate words, she cast the arm which she reproached, heedless of the pain, with fearful violence down upon the jamb of the window, the blood spirting as she did so, from the ivory-white and soft flesh—a sight to make even the rude, but devoted dwarf, shudder, and to awaken in him a degree of sympathy which lifted his nature and turned all his better feelings into pity. “'Twa'nt the arm—'twa'nt the arm, Ma'am Florence—'twas the knife only that wa'nt fit for nothing, with all its shine and silver about it. If it had been this now, ma'am,” displaying his own heavy bowie blade, as he spoke—“there's no curl in this!—no mistake!” “Give it me!” she cried—“this it shall be yet. This feels like vengeance, Richard—there is strength enough in my arm, and resolution still in my heart. I cannot fail now—there is still something for which Florence Marbois may live.” She seized the weighty instrument as she spoke, turned it beneath her eye, grasped with one hand the massy blade, which she strove in vain to bend; then, as if satisfied that it was now only necessary to strike the blow, was about to hurry from the apartment, as if in pursuit of her victim; but the cooler dwarf threw himself between her and the door. Significantly putting his fingers on his lips as if in token of silence,—with an audacity which was unusual, and which, at any earlier day, would have found its immediate and unmeasured rebuke from the lips of the haughty woman—he gently grasped her wrist, and led her back into the darker part of the room out of sight and hearing from the window. Once there, he counselled her to the delay of a few moments, while he left the house, and stealthily examined all its approaches which might conceal a lurking spy. His own practices had necessarily made him properly suspicious of all others, and had endowed him with the skill to provide against all detection. Finding that the coast was clear, and having ascertained that Saxon and Jones, whom he most apprehended, were gone to some distance in the encampment, he hastily returned to his mistress, after the lapse of a few moments. He found her as much excited as ever, and doubly impatient to proceed in consequence of the unwonted constraint which had been put upon her. The reasons for this restraint he proceeded to declare in his own rude language: “Why, Ma'am Florence, it's no use for you to go now—Saxon 'll never let you try it again. You can't get nigh enough for a single dig at him; and if you did, he'd be wide awake for you. He'd take the knife from you, 'fore you could say Jack Robinson, and laugh at you more than ever.” A glance of fire—a fierce stare—rewarded the speaker. There could be no enmity at that moment more decided, in the estimation of her anguished heart, than that which seemed to insist upon the impracticability of its hope of vengeance. “What then? Am I to submit? To bear his scorn, his desertion? Is he to walk with booted footstep across my heart? Wherefore do you stop me? Speak, sir,—I command you! Tell me other things than this, or be dumb for ever. I will not hear you,—I will hear nothing that takes from me the last hope of my heart—which baffles and denies the only prayer which I am prepared to make in life.” The dwarf was not unwilling to comply. He had no purpose of baffling her vengeance. A bitter smile passed over his squalid cheeks. His mouth widened into a grin, and at another time, the malignant fires which darted from his eye, might have awakened in the bosom of his fair companion, a feeling of shuddering disgust. Her own roused and embittered spirit, jaundiced by the passions which inflamed it, sufficed to blind her to the unconcealed malice of his. She saw not the gloating expression of his features,—she heard only those accents which promised her the vengeance she desired. He showed her how vain would be her hope to succeed in any renewal of her late attempts, to avenge her wrong in person. He admitted, also, the great difficulty in the way of his succeeding, unless with circumstances greatly in his favour, of a conflict with a man so powerful of frame and so practised in his arms as Saxon; but there was another way, which, while it demanded greater delay, promised to be followed by better results. “The reg'lators are out, and it's how to hide is the talk among the beagles. There's an old man, a preaching Methodist, that's all bite, on t'other side of the “Big Black,” at a place called Zion's Hill,— he's been a mustering more than a week now, and it's only because he don't know which way to set his nose, that he aint on trail after the beagles afore this. He's got a son that barks with us, and we know from him how the cat jumps. Then there's a lad, one Wat Rawlins, that's been a contriving again us too. Jones is more afraid of him than t'other, 'cause he don't say much, and Badger always preaches what he's guine to do; now, it's only to show this here chap, Rawlins, how to find the track for Cane Castle, and let him make a start on a sudden, and its all mush with Saxon. There's two dogs that barks between us and Rawlins, and its only to send 'em off sarching for John Cole's mare; then Rawlins can bring his men into the swamp unbeknowing to all, and it's a better knife than yours or mine, Ma'am Florence, that does the business.” “I see! I see!—and you will go to these men, Richard, you will bring the avenger into the swamp —you will show them where he sleeps,—Ha!” To these eager demands and exclamations the answer of the dwarf was slow. He had his reasons for deliberation—he had his own bargain to make; and, with the policy of a more cunning tradesman, his reluctance to answer the requisitions of the superior, grew in proportion to the eagerness of her demand. That she might be avenged amply by the means he suggested, and by his means, he proceeded to reiterate. The particular process was all shown—his own consent to do the office, which could evidently be done by no one so well as himself, was the only point upon which he hesitated to declare himself. “I will reward you, Richard—you shall have all —every thing—money, jewels—every thing, I repeat—for why,” she added mournfully, as if to herself—“why should I keep aught? I shall have little need for gold or jewels when that is done—little need, and oh! how much less desire,—speak, Richard, tell me that I may rely on you for this last service. Be faithful as you have been before, and take what you will—take all that I have to bestow.” “You say it, Ma'am Florence—you'll promise me,” demanded the dwarf with an eagerness equalling her own, while, in his gloating eyes an expression of anxious desire, might have been easily read by any observer less blinded than the woman to whom it was addressed. “Have I not said? Surely I promise. Why should you doubt—why hesitate? Have I ever failed where I promised, Richard? Have you not ever had your reward from me? I repeat, you shall have, when you have done me this service,—when you have brought the officers of justice into this den of thieves,—when the chief villain of the band is a captive, and the hope from his heart, like that from my own, is gone for ever—you shall have all the wealth—the money and the jewels—which I have! Nothing shall be withheld of value that you may demand. You shall be my heir, Richard—you shall inherit all!” “All in your power to bestow!” slowly spoke the dwarf, repeating a portion of her previous words. “'Twas that you said, Ma'am Florence.” “Yes—again I say it: you shall have all in my power to bestow.” “It's a promise, Ma'am Florence—good as Bible oath.” “As if I had sworn it!” solemnly replied the woman. He caught her wrist eagerly in his hand, drew her towards him, and, rising on tip-toe, whispered in her ear. As the communication, whatever it was, reached her senses, she recoiled from his contact— shook herself free from his grasp, and, receding a step, regarded him with an expression of countenance in which contempt and scorn were mingled equally. The eye of the abashed dwarf sank beneath the fire-flashing glances of hers; his frame faltered, and an effort which, at the same moment, he made to speak, died away in confused and feeble accents, which were utterly unintelligible and almost unheard. Meanwhile, various were the thoughts which coursed rapidly through the mind of Florence Marbois. Anger and vexation at first were predominant feelings—so strong in the first moment after his communication had been heard, as almost to obliterate, during the same brief space, all memory of the vengeance which she had sworn against her seducer. But very soon these feelings passed away. “I must be proud no more,” were the words which at length broke from her lips. “I mock myself with these shadows. Richard,” she said, advancing as she spoke, and extending her hand, “it shall be as you say. All that is left me to bestow, shall be yours, when you have accomplished my vengeance.” He grasped the extended hand, and carrying it to his lips, covered it with such caresses as a she bear might have lavished upon her last cub in licking it into shape. Florence Marbois had sunk wofully in her own estimation. Her pride was gone, and she had nothing to live for; but she withdrew the hand that suffered from the slaver of the deformed, with a strong expression of disgust. “Enough, Richard. And now to the prosecution of these plans.” It will not need that we follow the dialogue in all its details. It is sufficient for us to say, that Stillyards, being familiar, by reason of his espionage, with all the circumstances of the chief robbers in the swamp, and with all those more prominent sources of danger which they feared, was better prepared than Saxon or Jones could have believed, to devise an effectual plan for their capture. It was not long before he was despatched by his mistress from her presence. There were new reasons added to old ones, why she should desire to send him forth as speedily as possible. He was not simply a means of vengeance—he had become a creditor; and the miserable debtor, who, though ruined, had still in her soul some glimpses of the better nature from which she had fallen, began to shudder at the humiliating moral bondage which such a condition always seems to imply. The instrument of her necessity was an object of her disgust. Hitherto, she had been able to reward him with money; now, he felt the large increase of his power, and his demands had grown in proportion. He was become ambitious—money no longer answered his desires; and he, who by reason of his low birth, vulgar life, and deformed person, had never been able to attach the affections of another, now aimed to secure the highest and finest and sweetest of all human affections, as the reward of his ministry. “And wherefore should I scruple at this?” was the demand which Florence Marbois made of herself, as if in self-justification, when she was left alone. “It is at best a word—a pledge which is dissolved in the very hour which brings Edward Saxon to his doom. She is a fool, a worse than idiot, who survives life's purposes—and I have but one purpose in life. That satisfied, and I may well assure this vain and miserable game-make that all shall then be his which is in the power of Florence Marbois to bestow.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XVII. “Good sir, softly: you ha' done me a charitable office.” Winter's Tale. Let us now return to our Thespian in the swamp. We left him, with Jones, skimming along in a little dug-out over the turbid waters of the Chitta-Loosa. Jones delighted in fishing, and found sufficient employment in pursuing this occupation. Horsey seemed content to be a spectator; but the wily outlaw very well knew that his content would be of no very long duration, unless the food on which he better fed than any thing besides—the oily applause of the audience—was brought in, to quiet an appetite that no measure of success could satiate. Accordingly, he suffered not his own vocation so far to occupy his attention, as to make him regardless of his companion's temper. From the moment when he cast forth his lines, he began to ply the actor with stage reminiscences, and to challenge his opinions upon all stage matters. These requisitions were all-important to the perfection of the proposed establishment at Benton. Finding deception easy on all kindred subjects, Jones enlarged his fictions. He suggested a grand scheme of theatrical organization, which was to extend itself over the whole country, from West Tennessee down to the Bay of VOL. II. 20 Biloxi. A company was to be planned, with corporate powers, in several of the southwestern states, which was to build theatres in all eligible places, and divide the year in separate seasons of three months in each of them. The management was to be conferred on Horsey. Never did the innocent flats of our backwoods suffer the delusion of a mammoth bank, or a mammoth railroad, to take such complete hold of their credulous imaginations. Like the schemes of these great companies, generally, the wily outlaw made it appear, that the plan was not only to be pleasant and profitable, but excessively patriotic. “At least,” said this experienced stockdealer, “at least, my dear Horsey, we shall make, as salaried officers, though the stockholders lose. The profits, if enough to pay us, are enough for the patriotism of the thing.” “But it must be profitable to all parties,” said Horsey, whose morality was somewhat less discursive than that of his companion. “Ay, ay—to be sure it must. The country will be a great gainer in money and morals, and—” “Certainly, such a diffusion of Shakspeare alone, must have that effect.” “It will. That alone should be a sufficient consideration to induce the state to subscribe largely; and I have no doubt she will, when her legislators are mado to perceive the patriotism of the thing. Then, if we can get a charter for a banking house with a capital of ten millions, our triumph is complete. We can establish houses every where—raise companies,—issue moneys—do any thing. Our labours being for the public good, we can appropriate lands and tenements, I am of opinion, without ever paying for them.” “Impossible!” exclaimed Horsey, who had evidently less legal learning than his companion. “And why impossible? Ours is a public work. Our charter, it is true, declares it to be private; but it is admitted that our labours are likely to be productive of public good, and would it not be monstrous if a single citizen, here and there, should resist a measure that is for the good of the whole.” “True, there is something in that,” said Horsey; “but is it so clear that we can take private property at pleasure for the public good.” “Certainly—the majority declares what is for the public good, and makes the law accordingly.” “But—the constitution—what does the constitution stand for then—of what use?” “Nay, I don't know that. For my part I never did see the use of a constitution at all; and it is clear to me, that it could be of no sort of effect against our company, if we can only get a charter for it. That we can do, if we only pay two or three lawyers handsomely, and secure a few of the most famous orators at a fine salary. They'll gull the flats by fine speeches which shall prove to them that they're the most noble, patriotic folks under the sun; and we'll pick their teeth, while their jaws are on the stretch, listening to these fine sayings. Two to one on it, Horsey, that in a year's time, the state will lend us a million to begin with, and take stock in the great Mississippi Shakspearean and Thespian Company, to three times that amount.” “I'm not so sanguine, Jones,” said the other, “but I'm sure if it would do so, the stock would be a cursed sight better than that of half of these banks and railroads. As for the banks, it's clear, they've swamped all the planters; and as for the railroads, I reckon we shall have to leave them in the swamps, where they'll stick for ever. Your plan, I'm afraid, is almost too grand a one. Something on a smaller scale now, would be more likely to be successful.” “Lord love you, Horsey, my dear fellow, you know nothing about our people when you talk so. It's nothing but grand schemes that go down with them. They can only understand the incomprehensible—they can only admire what is beyond their calibre. Tell them of small schemes which are possible and practicable, and which might yield them moderate profits and be of some service, and they will turn up their noses in disgust. They despise little projects. But get up a grand Religious Steam Association; or a company for connecting Pensacola with San Jacinto by means of chain or floating-bridges; or a line of Balloon Stages to the North Star, or a Patent Process for Converting Bad Planters into Great Merchants—propose some such moderate matters to them as these, and they'll take stock directly. They've lately formed a society in New England for keeping the peace among the potentates in Europe, and there's not an old woman in all the villages that don't subscribe a shilling weekly to prevent Louis Philippe from kicking the Grand Turk, and arrest the Emperor of Russia in his indecorous attempts to void his quid in the face of Sultan Mahmoud. That's a society now that's likely to be profitable.” The outlaw was about to pass, by a very natural transition, from the consideration of these grand and patriotic modes for picking the pockets of the people, to a short analysis of the half exploded and vulgar methods of doing the same thing as practised in ancient times. He was prepared to show that the old highway custom of bidding a true man “stand and deliver,” was altogether, and happily, abrogated by such small legal processes as are comprehensively described under the general designation of charters. It would have been very easy, indeed, for one so well versed in the inquiry as himself, to show—what the reader is already prepared to believe—that the “Border Beagles” were, indeed, “chartered libertines” of the same class; yet, as they did not transact business on a scale so magnificent, and as they were rather less ostentatious in their operations, they could not so openly challenge the admiration of mankind. It caused the worthy outlaw, indeed, a sigh, when he reflected that all that was necessary to enable the company under whose authority he performed his operations, to become shrined in the admiration and estimation of the people from the Tar River to the Colorado, was a simple instrument under the hands of a State Legislature, which a fine orator could readily procure, and a docile representation would delight to grant. A change of name might, indeed, be necessary, and, perhaps, a declaration of objects slightly differing from that which were in reality entertained. A people, it seems, who are fitted for self-government, must yet have its expenses concealed from their sight, and its penalties disguised under the name of pleasures. “Border Beagles” was a good name—easily articulated—but to get a charter for far more increased operations, it might be necessary to change it into something of a more imposing, and less vague signification—“The Great Southwestern Transportation and Specie Deposite Company,” would be a longer and more specific title—long and loose enough to obtain charters from any six States in the Union. Jones was full to overflowing with these ideas and their tributaries; but Horsey was something less of a moralist and politician than the outlaw; and his undisguised yawns soon apprised his companion of the necessity of returning to the ground from which they had episodically departed. Even 20* the establishment of great houses for stage-playing, were as nothing to the play itself, in the imagination of the actor; and when his attention flagged in considering the former, it revived with double force and interest when the latter topic was resumed. Jones professed himself tired of law and morality, and begged that Horsey would restore the tone of his mind by a specimen. One specimen begat two, two begat three; specimens produced varieties of readings in favourite passages; and in twenty minutes, with a patient and applauding auditor, Hamlet was “himself again.” Never had he read so well before—never had his action been so flexible and felicitous. “Cautiously, my dear fellow,” said Jones, with a warning voice—“cautiously, and trim the boat—she dips already, and it won't take much to bare her bends.” “Yes, yes!” impatiently replied the actor, “I see —I'll take care;” and then he returned to his theme which had been the discussion of one of the readings of a favourite actor. “Now you see, Mr. Jones, in the reading of that passage, Forrest is clearly wrong: `Hang out our banners!' he says with an exclamatory pause; then adds, `On the outward walls, The cry is still they come.'— Now, why should he depart from the old style of reading, which is thus:— `Hang out our banners on the outward walls; The cry is still they come!' Why should we suppose that the coming of the enemy is only announced on the outward walls? The cry is every where—the whole castle hears it. Macbeth himself announces it, he being within the castle at the time. In this reading the passage is without sense. The truth is, that the intelligence having reached Macbeth that the enemy is still coming,—a fact, which his previous confidence in the weird sisters has led him to doubt—he gives those orders which would be given even now by every commander. `It is time to hang out our defiance— they have come near enough to see it. It will show them that we are prepared for them,—it will show our own people that we do not fear the foe.' It was not customary to hang out the banners except on occasions of state and danger. In old times, banners were more costly things than they are now. They were covered with gold and blazonry of a very rich and perishable character. Even now, they are never hung out except in cases of ceremony, or in the expectation of actual conflict. They are kept carefully within the castle till the approach of the foe, and then, with the soldiers, advanced to the walls. The same scene in which this passage occurs, describes, as stage directions, the entry of Macbeth, with drums and colours, within the castle, followed by Seyton and the soldiers. They were then about to go forth to the defence of the walls, the sentinels on the watch having warned them that the time for actual conflict was now at hand, and the hanging the banner on the outward wall, was the only mode by which the proper defiance of the defenders was to be displayed.” “Clearly you are right,” said Jones, whose turn it was now to yawn. “Now for that famous and much disputed passage— `She should have died hereafter.”' “Mind the boat,” remonstrated Jones, who felt his little cockleshell becoming momently more and more capricious under the increasing earnestness of the actor. “Ay, ay!” said the other, reciting— “`She should have died hereafter;— There would have been a time for such a word, To-morrow—and to-morrow, and to-morrow—”' “By Jupiter, Horsey, we shall be over it you don't be very careful.” “No fear—no fear!” said the actor impatiently, as he hurried with the passage,— “`And to-morrow, and to-morrow, Creeps in this petty pace, from day to day, To the last syllable of recorded time;—”' Jones, at this recorded time, was constrained to give all his attention to the trim of his boat. “`And all our yesterdays,”' Proceeded the actor with the solemn sententiousness, and gloomy moral reflection of the tyrant at this period, when the last evils of life were accumulating about him, making him “sick at heart.” He, Horsey, was as thoroughly blind to the wrigglings of the outlaw, as the outlaw was now become indifferent to the readings of the actor. “By G—d!” muttered the former, we shall have a capsize. “`And all our yesterdays have lighted fools The way to dusky death. Out, out, brief candle!”' Here the action of Horsey verified the apprehensions of the outlaw. “That putting out of the candle did the business,” said Jones, afterwards. “Life's but a—!” The water rushing into Horsey's ears, nose and mouth at this moment, put an effectual extinguisher upon the sad, moral reflection of Macbeth, and ended the new reading of the much disputed passage. The boat went over in spite of all the outlaw's efforts to maintain her equilibrium, and Macbeth ended his speech by a puffing, plunging, and blowing, which might have done honour to the wind-bags of a porpoise. “Phew! Jones—what the devil's the matter?” was his cry, as he rushed to the top of the muddy river. “`Out, out, brief candle!”' exclaimed Jones, struggling to the banks. “I warned you, Mr. Horsey—I warned you several times.” “Warned me! How warned me?—warned me of what?” “Of tilting the boat.” “The devil you did—I never heard you.” “`Life's but a walking shadow,”' said Jones, repeating a fragment of the passage; “but you'll find it difficult to walk where you are. While you have life for it, Mr. Horsey, you must strike out— the water's at least twenty feet over your head.” “So I find,” replied the actor, striking for the shore. With some difficulty he scrambled up the oozy elevations, borrowing from the liberal banks as he went, a portion of their capital at every step. “Good G—d, Jones—my Hamlet!” exclaimed the unfortunate histrion, surveying the ruined garment, which had swallowed up so many goodly pounds of his father's cotton. “My Hamlet—a splendid black silk velvet jacket, fly-trunks, and mantle—magnificently bugled—cost me at Stubb's three hundred and sixty dollars—and now utterly ruined. D—n the boat,—that I should have trusted myself in such a trap as that!” “Don't be angry, my dear fellow,” said Jones, with a grin which conveyed very equivocal consolation. “Once under way, and you will soon be able to replace it, I trust. That scheme of ours— the Grand Mississippi Shakspearean and Thespian Company—” “Look you, Mr. Jones, don't talk to me of schemes. Let's go back where I can get my bags. I must change. I feel like a drowned rat. I'm as slimy as an eel. It'll take me a week's washing to get this d—d ooze out of my hair.” “No, no! not half so long,” said the other, “I was once much longer in the mud, and got clean in three days.” This was said with great gravity. Horsey looked suspiciously upon the speaker, and for the first time, a latent notion seemed to waken in his mind that he had been quizzed a little; but, just at this moment, his eyes were attracted to the opposite banks. “'Gad, Jones, I must hide—there are women yonder. Who are they?” The actor stole behind some stunted bushes, from which he peeped out upon the distant cavalcade. “That's Brown Bess—Bess Yarbers, as I live— and that's my Juliet—my pretty Mary Stinson!— Eh! Jones, am I not right? What the devil do they want here?” “Hush! Come to join our company, I suspect,” replied Jones, with some anxiety in his voice. “'Gad, I'm glad of it,” exclaimed the actor,with a delight which made him quite forget the hurts of his Hamlet. “That Mary will make the loveliest Juliet, the sweetest Ophelia, the dearest Desdemona that ever was smothered when she should have been kissed. I told Bess to make an actress of her—I knew what she could do. It's a great acquisition, Jones. I'll go and meet 'em.” “What! in that trim?” “Ah, d—n the boat!” was the bitter exclamation of the enthusiastic actor, as, sinking back into his place of concealment, he suffered the new comers to pass from sight, and impatiently waited the moment when Jones might deem it proper to permit of their return to the encampment. The latter busied himself in recovering the boat, which had drifted a mile below, and was only kept from the embraces of the Mississippi by the branches of a fallen tree, among which it got entangled. By dint of swimming and wading, the outlaw recovered it, and Horsey was with difficulty persuaded to resume his seat in a fabric in which he could use no action, and accordingly could not speak. To deny him to suit the action to the word, was to make him dumb; and equally soaked, silent, and sad, the luckless actor suffered himself to be paddled back to the place from whence he set forth, only consoled under his misfortune by the reflection that he should soon see the lovely little damsel in whose sight, it may be said in this place, he had found quite as much, or even more favour, than she had found in his.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XVIII. `This subtle world, this world Of plots and close conspiracy.” Shirley. But he soon found it was no such easy matter to behold this damsel. The course of true love was not permitted to run smooth in his case, any more than in that of Romeo. It was not the policy of Jones to suffer the actor to come in contact with the Yarbers family. He knew the intimacy which already existed between him and brown Bess; and as the reader may have seen, the adherence of John Yarbers to the brotherhood, did not imply any attachment of his wife in the same quarter. Awkward revelations, for which the faternity were not yet prepared, might have resulted from a meeting of that dame with Horsey; and Jones made his arrangements accordingly to prevent it. But Jones could not be every where, however ubiquitous may have been his desires; and Bess, by some means, found out that Horsey was at Cane Castle. She probably had caught a glimpse of him as he emerged from his oozy bath, in the waters of the Chitto-Loosa; or, as is equally probable, John Yarbers was partially in the habit of serving two masters. He may have shared some of the secrets of the beagles, with his larger, if not his better, half. How she arrived at her knowledge, however, is very unimportant to our narrative. It is enough, that, once possessed of this knowledge, all the strategics of feminine policy were put in exercise to defeat the uncharitable designs of Jones. It was not a mere female curiosity which Bess sought to gratify in once more desiring to see the actor. Far from it. Other and more serious desires filled her mind; and the evident admiration—however strangely shown—with which Horsey regarded her daughter, had inspired her with the hope of connecting Mary Stinson with better fortunes, and less-doubtful family connexions, than those to which she had unhappily—and, to do her justice—unwittingly bound herself. Horsey was a wild chap—that she knew;—but his heart was in the right place, and he was the son of one of the most substantial of the small planters in Mississippi. Old John Horsey had what he had, free from debt, and was therefore more independent than most of his class. As he owed nothing, he had no favours to ask of the Brandon Bank, and could keep back his cotton till a favourable market. Alas! for Mississippi—nay, for half the southwest—that his policy had not been more general among the agriculturists of that region. The debtor is every where at the mercy of his creditors, and we are all debtors. But a truce to this; and, to sum up in brief, Brown Bess contrived to find a way to the actor. There was a moment when the outlaw, to whom Cane Castle was given in charge during the absence of the master beagle of the band, was necessarily withdrawn; and, seizing upon this moment, the persevering dame sought Horsey with success. At this interview, the poor actor was utterly overwhelmed by the tidings which he heard. At first, indignation seized upon him to think how he had VOL. II. 21 been imposed upon and laughed at; and he was for seeking the outlaw, and punishing him in the midst of the encampment. But the cooler woman checked these ebullitions of mortified vanity and impatience. She showed him the danger of this proceeding, and counselled him to a policy as deep and quiet as that of the beagles. Under her direction, arrangements were made for his escape; and wisely leaving all these to her, our actor, now considerably sobered on the subject of his grand steam company of theatricals, in which the state was expected to subscribe so largely, was content to play second fiddle for awhile in this political duet. Perhaps, he was the more readily reconciled to this inferior position by the presence of a third person, who had been judiciously provided to appear at the nick of time by the calculating Mrs. Yarbers. This was Mary Stinson. After her appearance, the mother might have made what arrangements she pleased. That nothing should be wanting to her schemes, she made away with herself after awhile, leaving the two children together—the babes in the wood—Horsey being as much a dreaming boy and as full of heart and enthusiasm, as if he never had known any of the world's experience; and Mary—poor Mary— as simple of soul and innocent of mind, as the adhesive, dependant and docile daughter of Polonius herself. It was strange with what rapidity the moments flew, when these two were left together. There—in that deep and quiet wood—thickly shaded by the intricate forests, that had never echoed to the dull cleaving blow of the destroying axe,—on the edge of that dark mysterious water—and with no sounds in their ears, but those which seemed to invite them to mutual sensibilities—sounds of birds and insects that hummed beside and above them, without any regular song, and with efforts that seemed to imply wakefulness and not work—life, rather than exertion—the hearts of the twain, in which the fire had been placed, if not kindled into flame, before, now warmed with a mutual ardour, and gushed freely with the sweet waters of a mutual affection. “It will do,” was the whisper of the mother of the girl, as through the leaves of a copse on one hand, where she had concealed herself, she saw the ardent amateur impress—having not the fear of Ned Mabry in his eyes—his second kiss upon the lips of the trembling and very much frightened damsel; and heard his pledges of love and promises of marriage. Then the old dame contrived to reappear and separate the parties. The very day on which Saxon bore away Virginia Wilson to the recesses of Cane Castle, our amorous actor might have been seen on old “dot-and-go-one,” his father's steed, with Mary Stinson perched behind him, going as fast as his passions could drive, and his decrepid steed would permit, in the hope of finding a convenient magistrate willing to officiate for love in a hurry, after the fashion of the Gretna blacksmith. The policy of Dame Bess might be supposed rather censurable by the very staid and starched prudes of a metropolitan city; but let them not bite their thumbs too inveterately. The old lady was desirous of getting her lovely daughter out of the swamp, and freeing her from that miserable connexion with a clan of robbers, from which, under existing circumstances, she could not free herself. She was anxious to marry her to a man of family and substance, and she knew that she could trust the honour of Horsey, to transact the business of hymen according to the State laws, on that subject made and provided. She could have wished, it is true, that the affair might have been conducted with more deliberation and under her own eyes; but as this could not be the case, she was too wise a woman to suffer such matters to stand in the way of primary objects; and, counselling the couple how to keep the narrow road on the swamp, which would lead them, by a short ten miles, to Squire Nawls, she sent them off, with a God-speed, to be happy after a fashion that, however constantly practised for six thousand years, has not yet fallen into disuse. One incident, which occurred before the departure of Horsey from Cane Castle, should not be unnoted. While yet utterly undreaming of the revelations subsequently made by Brown Bess, and while still perfectly persuaded that he was the member only of a brotherhood of Thespians, who, if ignorant, were yet innocent, the enthusiastic amateur found an opportunity of making his way to the presence of Florence Marbois. Regarding her as the prima donna, the great gun, the tragic muse of the company, he could not refrain—though counselled to beware of the weapon of her husband, whom Jones described as “worse than a Turk for jealousy”—from contriving an interview with one from whose great powers he promised himself no small support in the personation of his loftier characters. The play at cross-purposes between them which followed this interview was as mysterious to both, as it would have been ludicrous to a spectator at all aware of their true history. Horsey addressed her as Lady Macbeth, or Portia, or Constance, and she replied to him in such language as would have suited well the auditories of a conscious knave. The poor actor was utterly confounded, and did not feel at all satisfied with, however much as an amateur he might admire, the lofty scorn which looked out from her eyes, and the contemptuous language which rose upon her lips, in reply to all his high-flown speeches. She sooner comprehended his true position than he hers. Perhaps she had some inkling of the truth before. “You are mistaken, sir, in me, if not in yourself. You have been imposed upon, and are in a den of thieves, from whence you had best escape as soon as possible. Leave me, sir.” “But, my dear Mrs. Clifford,” was the objurgatory opening of the bewildered actor. “Clifford! Begone, sir,—you are mad. I tell you, you are among knaves and thieves. You are gulled, imposed upon. Go home to your parents.” “`Was ever woman in such humour wooed?”' was the slowly spoken sentence of Horsey, as the haughty Florence, after this scornful counsel, withdrew from his presence. Two hours after this interview, he was made to comprehend its true meaning and the manner in which he had been played upon, by the more painstaking and common-sense personage whom he was about to select as a mother-in-law. It might not have been so easy for herto subdue the wrath which her revelations excited in his mind, had it not been for her lovely daughter; and that movement of the maternal tactician which left the two children to their own cogitations. The result of these cogitations we have seen in the departure of the happy pair, riding double on “dot-and-go-one,” in search of the country squire. But one thing qualified the otherwise unmixed joy of the actor in this novel situation. It was the necessity of leaving his saddle-bags behind him, with the best of his theatrical wardrobe. This necessity occasioned some serious fears, but the better baggage which filled its place, soon reconciled him to, if it did not make him absolutely forgetful of, his loss. Let us now return to Harry Vernon, whom we left, attended by the faithful Jamison and the two 21* constables, on his way to Mr. Justice Nawls, to undergo his examination for the murder of Thomas Horsey, Esquire. The justice was a plain farmer-looking person, very ignorant of books and refinement, but with some knowledge of men and things, which, on the borders of every country, is by far the better sort of knowledge. He came out of his fields, and in the same condition in which he used his hoe, he sat down to make his examination. He was in his shirt-sleeves, which were rolled up to the elbow; his bosom was bare, and none of the cleanest; and the perspiration, discoloured by the dust through which he had been, stood in dark dots upon his cheeks and forehead. What a lecture on American jurisprudence would have been written by that profound spinster, Harriet Martineau, or that profound sea-attorney, Captain Basil Hall, or that social martinet, Col. Hamilton, could they have been present at this examination. Justice Nawls had no need of books, or statutes, or authorities, and still less occasion did he seem to have for tablets and a clerk. The proceedings were summary enough. There were two sly fellows who swore to several suspicious circumstances against our hero. It was proved that Horsey and Vernon were seen together last—that the time of their separation was unknown—and that, a short time after, poor Horsey was found in the woods bored through with bullets, dirked in sundry places, his ribs literally riddled and laid bare—and his bloody coat and breeches were finally produced in damning confirmation of this tragedy. Such was the testimony of Augustus Mortimer and Edward Montmorenci. The alias of a rogue is usually a very ear-taking concatenation of syllables; and, par parenthese, what an adroit rascal is Davy Hines, the celebrated South Carolina swindler (all rascals are celebrated in North America, while great statesmen, orators, poets, and actors, are simply notorious), in the selection of his temporary nom de guerre. He is for the nonce, an Allston, a Hamilton, a Rutledge, a Berkeley, a Singleton, or a Livingston. Sometimes he condescends to be a Hayne, or a Benton, and he has even been known, on trending farther east, to contract himself into a Webster or an Adams. Colonel Augustus Mortimer swore with singular precision and confidence, and Major Marcus Montmorenci followed him. Vernon examined these two worthies with the utmost care and vigilance, but they were as impenetrable as they had shown themselves incorrigible. They just swore to enough to place the offence at his door, without committing themselves by the positive asseveration that they had seen him do it. They were old practitioners, in one form or other, in half the courts of Mississippi, and knew all the quirks of justice, however little they might have really cared about its principles. Poor Vernon was in a quandary. He saw that Squire Nawls could do no less than commit him, on the strength of the testimony offered; and though this testimony fell short of convicting him of the offence, he yet could not but feel that the refined rascals whose deposition had been just taken, had wrought him some very troublesome meshes, from which it would not be so easy to extricate himself upon trial. Still the awkwardness, if not the danger of his own situation troubled him less than his particular arrest at such a moment. There was the affair of Carter, his friend, which he was anxious to bring to a conclusion which might save him as well as the miserable father of the very lovely Virginia. And she—just won, and so soon lost. Ah! reader, if you have a heart at all, and have not forgotten all the love-passages of your boyhood's days, think of the thousand privations involved in that separation. If Vernon was annoyed, poor Jamison, his Alabama friend, was utterly confounded at the aspect of his affairs. Unwilling to believe the youth guilty, for whom he had taken a liking as extreme as sudden, he was yet staggered by the closeness of the testimony against him—the nice linking together of the circumstances as declared by the joint evidence of Messrs. Mortimer and Montmorenci, and the grave, deliberate, and very genteel appearance of those worthy witnesses. It was in vain that he added to the cross-examination of Vernon, as many questions as, in his sagacity, he thought might be instrumental in bringing out a difference in their statements. His efforts were more perplexing to himself than to the witnesses, and with a groan that came from the bottom of his heart and was almost a growl, he gave up all farther attempts at examination. So also did Vernon himself, and Justice Nawls proceeded to write out and sign the commitment of the prisoner, for further and final trial—a manual performance, not so easy to one whose skill in penmanship was of that “d—d cramp” sort, which bothered Tony Lumpkin. The deed was done, however, and the constables were just beginning to bustle about for the resumption of their charge in conveying Vernon to prison, when a hubbub was heard without, and the accents of a voice which, to the ear of our hero, seemed no less sweet than familiar. “Now is the winter of our discontent made glorious summer,” cried one from without. “By heavens!” exclaimed Harry Vernon, “that is Mr. Horsey himself.” “So it is, Harry, my boy,” cried the actor, rushing in and bearing on his arm the shrinking form of the half-affrighted Mary Stinson, whose cheeks, glowing with the deepest tints of the carnation, betrayed the mingled effects of a ten mile ride with her lover, and the not unpleasant novelty which she felt to exist in such a situation. “Who else but Horsey,” exclaimed the delighted actor,—“who but the young Lochinvar,” and he concluded by singing a stanza from the popular song of that name, by which he communicated the tenor of his love adventure, and the reason of his appearance with his fair companion. “They'll have fleet steeds that follow, Harry, my boy,” he continued, “though, truth to speak, had they started as soon on the chase of old Bowline, as they did after Lochinvar, Tom Horsey would have won no bride to-day. You recollect my little Juliet, Harry?—Mary Stinson? Come forward, Mary— don't be shy—don't be scary,—it's Mr. Vernon, that came with me to your house—Mr. Harry Vernon; and there's the squire that's to make us man and wife,—and these gentlemen, why I take it, they're all friends to a frolic, and a good fellow when he's about to go off, like a comedy, in a happy ending.” “Mr. Horsey, I was never more rejoiced to see any one in my life, than I am to see you;” said Vernon. “You've come at the most providential moment for my safety.” “Your safety!” “Yes—I am here before the magistrate charged with murdering you.” “The devil you say!” “However strange, it is no less than truth. Squire Nawls, let me introduce to you my friend, Mr. Thomas Horsey, of Raymond, the gentleman with whom I travelled, and whom I stand suspected of having killed. You see that as he is alive, I cannot have murdered him.” Squire Nawls looked bewildered, and turned inquisitively to Messrs. Mortimer and Montmorenci. An incredulous and sarcastic smile sat upon the countenance of the first named of these gentlemen, A brief pause followed. “You see, gentlemen,” continued Vernon, turning to them also, “that the body which you found and buried was that of some other person, and the clothes which you have shown—” “Were those of Mr. Thomas Horsey and no other,” said Mr. Augustus Mortimer, with the utmost coolness and a quiet imperturbable composure, that obsolutely shocked the Alabamian, whom the promise of a change in the colour of Vernon's fortunes had provoked to a shouting, cheering, and dancing, which, for several moments, utterly banished silence and stateliness from the hall of justice. “That is not Mr. Thomas Horsey,” continued Mr. Mortimer; “we buried the poor young gentleman with our own hands. Did we not, Major?” Major Montmorenci confirmed this statement, by a conclusive nod to Justice Nawls. “The devil you did,” exclaimed Horsey, utterly aghast with the reckless hardihood with which the lie was spoken. “Yes, poor fellow,—he lies in the wood, a little way beyond the lower fork that leads to the two ferries.” “The devil he does!” continued the actor, with increasing astonishment, as he listened to the manner in which his body was disposed of. “Yes, we can show you the grave at any moment. We cut his name, T. H., with the year, in the bark of a hickory that stands over the spot.” “You were very good,” said Horsey. “No, no, not at all—it was only common charitable.” “Pray, my good fellow,” said Horsey, dropping the arm of Mary Stinson, and crossing over to where Mr. Augustus Mortimer stood, on the left hand of Justice Nawls, and looking him in the face with as much curiosity as astonishment—“pray, my good fellow, who may you be—what may be your name? I am, in truth, very anxious to know.” “Augustus Mortimer, Esq.,” was the calm reply, “son of the Hon. Bannister Mortimer, Judge of the United States District Court, in West Tennessee.” “You are—are you?—and you, sir,”—to the other witness—“pray, oblige me with your name and connexions.” The answer was equally prompt and civil. “Major Marcus Montmorenci, last from Virginia, a late settler in the Choctaw purchase.” “And you are sure, gentlemen, that you buried Thomas Horsey, of Raymond, under a hickory tree on the lower road to the ferry—and it was over his body that you were good enough to mark T. H., with the year—perhaps you put a death's head and cross bones above the inscription?” “No, sir, we put nothing but the initials, and the year; and we did not cut them as well or deeply as we could have wished, owing to the dullness of our knives,” said Mr. Mortimer. “And you are sure that it is my body—that is, the body of Tom Horsey—that you so charitably put from sight in that place?” “Very certain.” “How do you know that?” “Oh, my dear sir, these questions are very unnecessary and your manner is somewhat offensive. When I tell you, that my poor friend, Tom Horsey, was seldom out of my sight and company for a spell of four years at least, that we lived together, travelled together, and slept together at different and long periods, you certainly can't doubt that I ought to know him.” “And you, sir, have been equally intimate?” “Equally,” said the more sententious Montmorenci. It would he difficult to describe the expression of Horsey's face, as he hearkened to these cool asseverations, and marked the stolid composure of the two. “Really, gentlemen, you must excuse me, if I ask a few more questions. The Horsey, who is dead, and whom you buried—did he look any thing like me? There is some mistake—some deception in this, Squire Justice, which I must find out.” “Nothing,” said Mortimer. “Nothing,” said Montmorenci. “And yet,” said the former, looking at Montmorenci, with a grave inquisitiveness, “don't you think there is something in this gentleman's chin that looks like poor Tom's?” “Why, yes—there is a something—a—” “A sort of split—a—” “There's no split in my chin, gentlemen,” exclaimed Horsey, smoothing the misrepresented member—“it's as smooth and round as any chin in company.” “Oh, sir, we don't mean to say that they're alike —but there was a something—” “Yes, only a something—that is, they were both chins,” said Horsey—“for that matter, don't you think that we had other features in common? How about eyes, nose, head and hair?—pray, gentlemen, oblige me, by answering closely. The question is important, I assure you.” “Well, now, sir, to speak plainly, you are nothing like our poor friend, Tom Horsey. Tom, though an excellent fellow as ever lived, was monstrous ugly; now, if I were asked my opinion, I should say you are a very good-looking sort of person.” “Indeed! I thank you—so Tom Horsey was ugly, was he?—Squire Nawls, do me the favour to marry me with Mary here, while I have some remaining confidence in my own identity. If I talk much longer with these rascals, I shall begin to look upon Tom Horsey as a dead man. I suppose if she takes me as Tom Horsey, you can have no objection to give me that name till the ceremony's over; and after that, it's just what you please about the trial. Harry Vernon, don't think I am indifferent to your concern, my boy; but Mary's here alone with me—a sort of runaway match you see, though we have the mother's consent,—and I shan't be easy any more than herself, till she has a lawful right to look to me, and I have my lawful rights as well as herself. There may be another Tom Horsey but I don't believe it, and I know he can't be Tom of Raymond. Those breeches and that coat are mine, though how they came so bloody and holy is past my telling. They were stolen from me in the Big Black Swamp, as the newspapers say, by some scoundrel or scoundrels unknown. I don't say you stole 'em, Colonel Mortimer, or you, Major Montmorenci, but I intend to make you show how you got 'em, if there's any justice in Mississippi.” The answer of these worthies was made in high head and with some show of valour and defiance; but this, Horsey, whose regards were chiefly given to Mary Stinson, at this moment, did not seem to heed. “All in good time, gentlemen,” he said, “after the ceremony's over. I invite you to remain till then, though, in your ear, let me tell you, I look on VOL. II. 22 you to be as arrant a pair of liars as ever wagged a Munchausen.” Squire Nawls was better skilled in that department of his business for which Horsey demanded his present aid, than in any other of its requisitions. He saw no reasonable objection to giving the actor a wife as Thomas Horsey, though, in the next moment, he refused his own evidence as such, to prove himself alive. No assertions that he could make, no proofs that he could offer, could impair the positive and sweeping testimony of the two witnesses, or disturb the settled decision which the Justice had made before he came; and, in equal fury, the actor and the Alabamian listened to the regrets with which he sought to mollify his resolve, to commit the supposed murderer of Tom Horsey to prison. Before Nawls came to this conclusion, however—for the dull country justice had been somewhat confounded by the contre temps of the dead man's reappearance —he was compelled to retire in private conference with Mr. Augustus Mortimer, a minute's talk with whom was quite enough to set him on his legs. “Let him be Tom Horsey or the d—l, it matters nothing to you. You have the evidence of two witnesses that Horsey is dead, and you might go farther and arrest this fellow as an imposter. Though we've no instruction to do so, yet it might be good service to the beagles. Your account is easily squared with the state's attorney—there's the proof on which you committed Vernon to prison, and that's enough. Send him on his way, and let Cane Castle do the rest. I'll engage you never hear of him again from that quarter.” The commitment of Vernon was accordingly made out and delivered to the two emissaries of Saxon, in whose custody he had been left before. They had their instructions as well as Nawls, and they knew if he did not, that the unfortunate youth was reserved for the sacrifice by those whose secret haunts he was supposed to have invaded as a spy, and whose practices of crime he had been commissioned to arrest and punish. Meanwhile, the keen-searching mind of Vernon had discovered the true circumstances and secret of those difficulties by which he was involved. While he was under the impression that Horsey had really been murdered, he had little cause to think himself the object of an organised plan of injustice or detention. But the reappearance of the actor, and the revelations which he made during the random dialogue which took place on the examination, together with the fact that his clothes had been stolen, mutilated, and made bloody,—were circumstances of sufficient strength to open the eyes of the lawyer to the whole hidden truth. The conviction that he was singled out as a victim, and that the persons around him were mostly parties to the conspiracy, strongly impressed him with the necessity of being as cautious, yet seeming as little suspicious as possible. A look, and the significant application of his finger to his lips, at a moment when Horsey was about to blurt out in public, the whole burden of his discoveries in the swamp, fortunately served to check the torrent of his speech, and to impose upon him the necessity of a caution like that of Vernon, whose composure had seemed in his eyes very much like the most unmanly tameness. When the resolve of the magistrate was made known, Vernon remarked quietly, without any show of anger or suspicion to the justice— “I cannot blame you, sir,—as a lawyer, I should, perhaps, say that you have done nothing but your duty. There is evidently some mistake in this business, for this I know to be Mr. Thomas Horsey from Raymond, who was the only travelling companion I had from that place. Still these gentlemen who have given their evidence, may know another of the same name, who has unfortunately been murdered as they state. I do not gainsay their assertions—I only declare my innocence of the crime. Still, sir, you are not to know that, and could only do as you have done. One privilege, however, I must pray to be allowed—that of writing to my friends in Raymond and elsewhere, for the necessary evidence to prove my innocence and the identity of this gentleman. If you will suffer me to have a brief private conference with my two friends here, Mr. Horsey and Mr. Jamison, I will provide them with directions for seeing to this business, and procuring all the necessary proofs.” This small favour could not well be denied to a man in such an emergency. The calm, respectful deportment of the prisoner, his forbearance to hint or even look any of the suspicions which he really felt, deceived the witnesses as well as the justice. Looking upon it as certain that any evidence which he might procure from Raymond would come too late to affect a trial which was to take place in Cane Castle, and to be as summary as it was certain to be secret,—Mr. Augustus Mortimer, to whom Squire Nawls was wont to refer privately in all cases of especial doubt, recommended that his prayer be granted. “It will be getting these fellows, Jamison and Horsey out of the way—they might be troublesome—and before they get back with their witnesses, Cane Castle will have done his business beyond any Horsey's undoing. Let 'em talk together.” “And what are we to do for you, Harry Vernon?” demanded Horsey, the moment they reached the little chamber to which the courtesy of the justice had permitted them to retire. “Say the word, and I'm for you, `To the last gasp with truth and loyalty.”' In less classical style and language the Alabamian made a like offer of his services and sinews. “You shall say yourselves what you shall do for me, when I tell you how I stand,” said Vernon. “I am in the hands of outlaws—the witnesses who swore against me are outlaws, the constables who guard me are outlaws, and the justice who commits me is their creature.” After this startling preliminary, Vernon proceeded to classify those details of fact—those floating circumstances, which, picked up from sundry quarters, formed the groundwork of the faith that was in him. “And knowing this, you took it so patiently,” was the joint exclamation of Horsey and the Alabamian. “Had my passions been suffered to play as freely as yours, Horsey, Squire Nawls would never have permitted me this interview. But, stay, I do not hear their footsteps below—they have ceased walking—they are watchful. Not a word now above your breath, gentlemen, for it is now doubly important that we should be secret as the grave. Now, then, hear me. You are both strong men, and I am sure, as fearless as you are strong. I claim your help in a matter, which, were it your case, should freely command my own. You must help to rescue me from the clutches of these fellows.” The hands of the two were instantly clasped in frank and manly assurance upon that of the speaker.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">22* CHAPTER XIX. “Come, my good fellow, put thine iron on:— If fortune be not ours to day, it is Because we brave her.” Shakspeare. The reader must not, however, suppose that our three friends concluded their conference with this vague determination. Vernon was too good a politician, too keen a lawyer, not to see that, left to their own judgments, Dick Jamison might lose the game by his rashness, and Horsey by his frivolity. Their dialogue, which was somewhat farther protracted, was carefully given, on the part of the former, to a consideration of the difficulties surrounding him; and to the necessary steps which were to be taken by the two in effecting his rescue. It does not need that we should report these directions in this place, but leave to time, which usually ripens all projects, even those which events baffle, to bring about its natural results in this case as in all others. It will suffice to say that the manner in which Vernon carried their minds forward, step by step, with his, confirmed in him that tacit superiority which, from the first, neither of them had seemed willing to dispute. If Jamison regarded him as a fine fellow before, he now looked upon him as a “mighty wise one;” and the importance and dignity of the new offices put so suddenly on his hands, seemed to elevate the mind of our actor in his own estimation. He had never been much trusted with matters of importance before; and the idea seemed suddenly, though, perhaps, imperfectly, to open upon him; that, after all, Mr. Aristophanes Bull was not so great a booby, when he denounced tragedies as not “ser'ous things;” certainly, the new task before him of getting Vernon out of his present hobbles, seemed the most serious business of any to which he had ever yet set his hand. Not that Horsey had any scruples or apprehensions. There was no better pluck in Mississippi than that of our amateur. But he had just entered upon a new and exquisitely delicate condition. He had just formed a new and responsible relationship in life; and when he heard from Vernon that there was no doubt that he should be hurried off that very evening on his way to prison, and that any attempt to rescue him, to be successful, must be made that very night, he could only exclaim with a tribulation in his accents and countenance, which compelled the smile to the lips of his two companions— “But, dear me, Harry Vernon, what the deuse am I to do with Mary?” Vernon had not been inconsiderate on this subject. He had prepared himself to meet this difficulty, and by his counsel, Horsey was persuaded to make application to Squire Nawls for a temporary lodging for his new wife, until he could procure facilities for conveying her home to Raymond. This pretext enabled him to set forth that very evening, and simultaneously with the departure of Vernon under his guard, as if for Lucchesa, where he proposed to find a horse and side-saddle on sale. Nawls, after some moderate objections, was persuaded by a week's board paid in advance, and the honied arguments of the young husband, to accede to the proposed arrangement; and this matter settled, love consented to waive all farther objections to the quasi warfare which implored his assistance. Vernon communicated to both his companions the knowledge which he had acquired from his intimacy with Walter Rawlins and the methodist Badger. To the former he recommended them in the event of their failure to rescue him. As a sanction for their own proceedings in a business which promised to involve a great deal that was extra-judicial, he drew from his bosom the envelope which originally contained the blank commissions of the governor, intending to fill the blanks with their names, and thus furnish an authority which would not only assist them in commanding means for acting against the outlaws, but sustain them in their use, He now, for the first time, discovered the robbery that had taken place upon his person—a robbery which he could only ascribe to the practised and adroit hands of Saxon, performed while he was insensible. A bitter smile passed over the lips of the youth as he made this discovery, and traced, with rapid thought, the connexion of event with event, and agent with agent, all co-operating to the same end—his entanglement in present intricacies. But the resolution of Vernon, his sanguine temper and great self-confidence conspired to make him still hopeful even against the great odds of the beagle confederacy. Having satisfied himself, to his great relief, that the other packet, which contained the papers of Carter, remained in its original integrity, he determined still to keep it in his possession; as it was now fair to assume that the outlaw, convinced that he had obtained all that was hidden, and that he had found a sufficient clue to the progress of Vernon, would never dream of looking in the same place for a second deposit. With this conviction, he ceased to feel the loss of the one packet as a very serious evil. That packet involved none of his confederates—none of his friends. He alone was singled out as the victim, and, bating the loss of the commissions, which might be perverted to evil use by the outlaw, the utmost extent of his misfortune was already known in his own capture, and threatened imprisonment, if not murder. Vernon was not insensible to the risk he incurred among the outlaws, as one whose supposed endeavour had been to expose their haunts, detect their doings, and entrap their persons. He felt that should his two allies fail him at the fortunate moment, his blood would probably be poured out in some lone swamp fastness, while his mangled body would be left uncovered to yield a midnight repast to the gaunt and famished wolves, that traversed, at that period, the savage and uncultivated hills of the Choctaw purchase. These were annoying convictions, but Harry Vernon was a man. He spoke none of his apprehensions, and contenting himself with obtaining from Horsey all that he knew, had seen, or heard, while in Cane Castle; and with renewing his instructions on all matters which he deemed essential to the successful prosecution of their adventure, he presented himself to the officers, and declared his readiness to go with them. He had done all that it was in the power of man to do at that moment—he had exercised the closest judgment of which his mind was capable, uninfluenced by his own feelings, and the consciousness of danger, of which he could not entirely divest himself; and with a cheerful manner, and a resolute spirit, he left the rest to the courage and conduct of his friends, under the crowning favour of Providence. These did not desert him. Though neither of them very wise men, or solid counsellors, Horsey and Jamison were yet men of great nerve and composure; strong, as we have shown, of limb, and of undoubted energy and spirit. In their plans and schemes, alone, was it likely that they might fail; and in these respects, the forethought of Vernon had taken every precaution and made every arrangement that might be done by him under existing circumstances. His directions, which contemplated even the particulars of the scuffle with his robber guardians, the time, the manner, and the probable place, were ample, if not copious. But little more was needed, than that their objects and course should be unsuspected, that their horses should bring them to the season, and their hearts not fail them in the trying moment. Of course, it was the assumption of all parties at the outset, that the strife was to take place with the two outlaws, and those only, who had served as officers of justice from the beginning. One little difficulty, however, started into sight before they left the presence of the magistrate, and made Vernon tremble, for an instant, in doubt of all his schemes. The sturdy rogues, his captors, having no more to say in respect to himself, were disposed to annoy his friend Jamison, because of his interposition at Lucchesa in cutting the cords which bound their victim,—an act which they had then called a rescue, and which they were still disposed to consider so. They had probably consulted with Nawls on the subject, while Vernon and his comrades were planning his rescue in fact; and with the sober confidence of veteran knaves, they were resolved to extort a reasonable amount of hush-money from the sturdy Alabamian, while in presence of the justice. But Jamison's blood, which had been with difficulty restrained by the counsels of Vernon, and the obvious necessity of preserving a large degree of temperance in consideration of his friend's predicament, fired up at the first motion of the rogues. Knowing them, as he now did, to be the most impudent pretenders to official sanction, it was with no small difficulty, that he restrained himself from declaring aloud all that he knew, and pouring forth all that he felt. With all his attempts at moderation, his speech was certainly of a character to show but a very limited degree of success in attaining that which he sought. “Look ye, judge,” said he, “these niggers ought to be licked for tying a free white man as they did. I'm the man to lick 'em, let 'em give me the littlest eend of an opportunity. I was a-thinking to bring it afore you myself, because I'm hopeful there's something in the law books to make 'em sweat for roping a white man the same as if he was an ingin or a nigger; and if there aint, there ought to be, and our rip's can't put it there a bit too soon. I did take out my bowie-knife, jist as they say, but 'twa'nt to trouble them; though, Lord bless you, 'twouldn't ha' been so hard a matter neither, to cut 'em up mighty small as they run; but, as I don't altogether like to use a man's weapon upon a chap that shows me nothing but his back, I had no more thought of troubling them with it, than I have of troubling you. I used the knife only to cut loose the rope; and, all that was wrong in that business, was in using a weapon that was bigger than was needful, and that made two big men so shameful scary. As for 'resting me for that, squire, why, all I can say, 'two'nt do for them to try it, while I've got the same knife yet, and to the back of it a couple of pair of such bull-mouthed biters as these here perquissions. You've seen the new perquission guns, squire? Well, these pistols are after the same fashion. Here's four of them, and they're a wing or two quicker in the shot than any race-lightning. One pair of these pistols and this here knife, belongs to Mr. Vernon there—and I'll take care of them for him till he gets out of jail. I'll drop the rammer down their throats, and you'll see they all have their bellies full of bullets. Now, I'm a peaceable man, squire, for one that's so well prepared for war; but if I was twice as peaceable, and only half so well off in perquissions, if you was to say the word for these chaps to 'rest me, which I know you can't do as a gentleman and a righteous justice—why, I've only to turn one of these perquissions round about among the company—now here on this one, and now on that—and as there's no taking aim in such a promisc'us business, particularly with these mighty quick perquissions, I'm almost afraid to say, squire, how much risk you'd run yourself; though I'm hopeful the bullet's far off that'll ever trouble you. 'Twon't be such a death, squire, as I'd have you die of. As for these—look at 'em, squire, how they dodge—look at 'em, Harry Vernon! Ha! ha! ha! That's jist the way they were scared at Lucchesa—jist the way exactly;—they dodged when there was no sort of call upon 'em for it. Lord love you, my lads, if it makes you so squammish when I only p'int the thing at you, it would make you deathly sick, when I come in 'arnest. Squire, let me go home to my business in a civil manner, and don't listen to these ridiculous fellows. I've done for Vernon all that I reasonably could; and by the hocus, I'll be at court when his trial comes on, and if it's the last picayune in the pocket of Dick Jamison, or the last blood in his heart, it shall go to help him out of his troubles. If I hear you say, I'm not to be 'rested about this business, well, I'll be off at once, before night, for Lucchesa. If I'm to be 'rested for cutting loose a free white man, that was tied up wrongfully, say it as soon, and let's see the eend of it at once. P'int your finger now which way you please, and I'm ready, any side. If it's civility, well, I'm all civility—if it's for a close hug, tooth and timber, why there's not a bear in Loosa Chitto, that'll come to the scratch with rougher arms than Dick Jamison.” This interruption consumed some time; and long speeches, for which the western wanderers are rather famous, were as frequent and as fine, after a fashion, as half of those listened to with so much patience by the nation—particularly as they have to pay for them—at every session of Congress. Vernon confirmed the simple statement of Jamison, and insisted that all the violence shown on the occasion, was no more than was required to separate the bonds of a prisoner, who made no attempt to escape, and professed his willingness to go freely with the officers. True, this was a rescue in legal acceptation, but, under the circumstances, not such an one as would render a prosecution necessary; and Vernon contended for the point the more readily, as he could perceive that the justice desired nothing more than a loophole by which to escape from the necessity of taking steps against a man who had avowed such levelling principles—we had almost written pistols. The pistols indeed, were the principles; and no effect could have been more ludicrous than that which Jamison produced upon the company, justice and officers, as with a huge pistol in each hand, both of which he cocked, he made their muzzles describe a slow circuit round the apartment, allowing them to rest for a few awkward seconds whenever the line of sight was brought up to the face of one of the opposite faction. The constables dodged with little shame or scruple on such occasions; and the very Justice, VOL. II. 23 it is painful to add, though he did not allow his limbs to yield to such a discreditable weakness, could not keep his eyes from winking with singular frequency; and his cheeks—the Alabamian remarked afterwards with a singular show of satisfaction— grew whiter than any clabber that he ever saw or swallowed. The affair was compromised by the justice bestowing a reproof upon the offender, to which he submitted with the indifference of one who rightly estimated its value. “You've got to say it, squire,” said he, “it's your business and you can't help it, and that's the reason I let it pass and say nothing. But look you, Squire Nawls, if you wa'n't a justice, but jist a common man, I'd ha' been on top of you and through you, afore you'd 'a half finished what you've been saying. If there's any one thing in this world that I never could like, it's when I'm found fault with, jist at a time when I know that I'm doing the very thing that's right—and then to be spoke to on behalf of such a couple of small-souled sappy sticks as these— Grim! it makes me all bristles. I feel wolfy in twenty places, and—dang my buttons, judge, if the thing was to be done over ag'in, 'twouldn't be the rope only that my knife would slit; if I wouldn't cut a juglar or two there's no snakes in all Alabam.” It was with a feeling of relief that Nawls and his two emissaries beheld this sturdy democrat take his departure. He set out as if for Lucchesa, accompanied by the amateur, whose parting with his young wife was equally dramatic and characteristic, though still full of genuine feeling. Resolved on having, in these volumes, as little of the lachrymose mood as possible, we refrain from the tears and tenderness shown on the occasion. Our readers of the gentler sex, will please suppose that the omission is ours only;—had they seen the happy couple at the parting moment, had they heard the low tones and sweet assurances of Horsey, and witnessed the embrace, and seen the face of Mary buried in his bosom, and hearkened to her half-suppressed sobs, which spoke of hope and joy rather than any other emotion—they would have seen that there was no love lacking between the two in this early stage of their matrimonial felicity. Love, however,—domestic love in particular—is proverbially a thing of short stages; and the sun which is warm and bright to-day, may be under a very ugly cloud to-morrow; —but this is none of our business—“sufficient for the day is the evil thereof.” Vernon saw his friends depart with some anxiety. His own movements, under the guardianship of the tenacious constables, followed soon after. The evening shades were thickening as they set forth, and grave thoughts become gloomy ones in the twilight hour. Those of our hero were sad ones, at least, and they restrained his natural vivacity of temper, if they did not subdue and dispirit him. He was without arms, without present friends or succour,— accused of crime, and at the mercy of criminals. The increasing gloom of the forest, as they advanced upon their way, served to increase the cheerlessness of his situation, and to give an oppressive weight to those doubts, which necessarily came with his very hopes and anxieties. Horsey and Jamison were brave, but might they miss the route taken by the outlaws—might they not fail at the proper moment? Precipitation might be worse than halting apprehension, and the very levity of the former, with the rough and ready boldness of the latter, might serve to defeat the plans of the most deliberate and thoughtful. To a man of mind, there is nothing so productive of annoying doubts, as the dependance upon mere muscle. He turned for some sort of relief to his attendants. It was advisable to disarm their watchfulness, and, if possible, to impress them with the conviction that no kind of doubt of their professed character, had as yet risen in his mind. To seem to rely upon them, as peace officers of the country, was the most effectual way to assure them, that he was perfectly resigned to their custody. He, whom they well knew, was guilty of no crime, had nothing to apprehend from the awards of justice; and the mere temporary detention of his person, however troublesome and unpleasant, was not so great an evil as to make it likely that he would incur those risks to avoid it, which would inevitably follow any violent attempt to shake it off. It was no hard matter to engage them in easy conversation; and having paved the way for a familiar chit-chat by some good-natured common-places, Vernon proceeded to carry out his design in the way that he calculated would be most likely to effect it. He inquired of them, what they knew of the two men who furnished the evidence against him; and when, as he expected, they denied all knowledge of the witnesses, he boldly assured them, that they had sworn to utter falsehoods. “There can be no sort of doubt,” he said, “that Mr. Horsey is alive; and that is he, who came in so unexpectedly, when the case was going on. I never knew any other Horsey, save his father, in my life; and I am now convinced, that these two persons have uttered, what they know to be untrue; and if they dare come to the trial, I shall convict them of a base conspiracy against my life. It will be easy enough for my friends, to bring proof of what I say, and of my innocence. Indeed, as soon as Horsey and Jamison go where I have sent them, I shall come out under habeas corpus. But these scoundrels shall suffer for their malice, if there's law in Mississippi.” “I don't know—may be so,” returned one of the constables; “but what should make two men, whom you never saw before, swear ag'in the life of another? and then it seems mighty strange, if so be, the man that come to be married, was the raal Horsey—it seems mighty strange he should pop in jist at that minute.” “It was no less strange to me than to you,” replied Vernon; “but the truth is not lessened by the strangeness of the circumstance. That he is the real Horsey, I hope to show, as soon as my friends return from where I've sent them. As for the malice of these two witnesses, that I confess to you, is as singular and surprising to me, as it can be to any body esle. I never saw them before—am sure, I never did them any injury, and—” “But why should you call it a conspiracy?” “It evidently is—here are two men, whom I know nothing of, coming forward most strangely, to swear a crime against me, which I never did commit.” “Yes—but you see, we are not to know that— Squire Nawls aint to know that.” “True—I don't blame him. He has done nothing more than he was bound to do; but I am speaking of the two who have sworn to this falsehood—why they should—for what reason—with what hope or object—is a wonder of the strangest sort to me.” “You're sure you never had any quarrel with them before?” “Never saw them in all my life.” “Well, it is strange, if so be you didn't kill Horsey, and you never had a quarrel with these gentlemen, that they should swear ag'in you. You 23* aint made no enemies of any body? Beca'se these chaps mought be employed by somebody else.” “Not that I know of. I've quarrelled with nobody, and have made no enemies. Stay!—there is one thing!” exclaimed Vernon, with sudden earnestness, correcting himself as he spoke—“now that you put the question, I am reminded of a circumstance which may account for it.” Here he proceeded to relate the event recorded in our first volume, in which, while rescuing the traveller, Wilson, he shot the outlaw Weston, who was astride his body. “This robber might have friends and relatives, who have sought in this manner to avenge him.” “I don't think that,” said the rogues with one breath. “It would be more apt to scare his friends off, and if they was rogues themselves, they'd know better than to come before a justice. Squire Nawls is a mighty keen man when he's a judging—he'd see through a rascal as clear as a whistle, and pick the crooks out of his story in the twink of an eye. No, no! I reckon there's another way to account for it. We don't want to git you to confess, Mr. Varnon, for nobody's bound in law to tell ag'in themselves, but I reckon you did shoot the poor man, though, I s'pose, 'twas by accident, or else you fou't him fairly, and he got the fling.” Vernon re-asseverated his innocence, with the solemn earnestness of one who was really anxious that they should be convinced—so earnestly, indeed, and with such warm simplicity in his manner, that the rogues burst into a good-humoured laugh, and one of the most forward among them, clapped him civilly upon the back while he expressed the hope, that, even if he did kill the man, he should “pass under the tree without sticking fast to the limb;” or, as it is sometimes expressed, that he should “graze the timbers, without becoming dead wood.” It was just at this moment that a faint whistle reached the ears of our hero. This was the signal agreed upon between himself and his comrades; and circumstances seemed to be particularly favourable to their project. The road was narrow—a mere wagon-track—through which they were passing; night had set fairly in, and though a bright star-light whitened the wide arch of heaven, but a faint effusion of its rays guided our travellers along the dim and shady paths of the forest. To maintain a more certain power over their prisoner—whom, perhaps, because of the disgrace which had followed their first attempts to cord him, they had not bound—they rode close beside him on either hand. In consequence of the narrowness of the road, this mode of riding brought the horses of the three in absolute contact. The opportunity was too gratefully tempting to Vernon, and his heart bounded with the anxiety which he felt during the brief interval between the first and second signal of his allies. That second signal was the beagle-note. With a conviction that the robbers who attacked Wilson's carriage, and those who escorted him belonged to the same gang, Vernon had suggested the employment of this imitation sound, with the hope of misleading his guardians. The whistle which preceded it, was simply meant to indicate to himself the certainty of the subsequent signal being given by his friends. As had been anticipated, an echo from the right hand of the prisoner threw back an answering voice. “There's somebody's dog in the swamp,” said one of the rogues carelessly, prefacing with these words, his own excellent imitation of the cry. Again, more near and more distinct, came the note of Jamison, who proved no unworthy beagle whether in voice or limb. As if in sheer idleness of mood, did the same outlaw again respond to it. The third signal from the Alabamian, which immediately followed, was delivered from a bush almost beside the party; and at the same instant, the two constables drew up their horses, setting each a hand on the rein of Vernon's, to arrest his forward movement. They naturally looked to a meeting with their comrades; but were surprised in the next moment, as Vernon, yielding his rein entirely, threw an arm round the waist of each of his attendants, and by a sudden exertion of all his strength, drew them together before him upon his steed, until their heads clashed with a stunning concussion. Before they could recover from the shock, draw knife or pistol, or make the smallest effort, a stout hand from below had relieved Vernon from his burdens; and the self-appointed officers of justice found themselves let down with no gentle ministry upon the earth, which, fortunately, being on the skirts of the swamp, and sufficiently pliable, manifested no stubborn resistance to the reception of their persons. The surprise was as successful as it had been sudden; and while a stout man bestrid each of the prisoners with a heavy and bright bowie blade pointing down and sometimes painfully tickling their throats, Vernon, having secured the three horses, proceeded to divest the rogues of all their weapons. This done, under the direction of Jamison, who had taken care to provide the necessary plough-lines, he bound their arms securely behind them, and thus fastened, they were once more permitted to rise upon a level with their captors. “A short horse is mighty soon curried,” said Jamison, when the business was finished. “I know'd all along, Varnon, that these here chaps hadn't any perquission in their guns, and it's now what we're to do with 'em. That's the question. They're to be lynched I reckon, of course; but whether to lynch 'em here where nobody can get any good from seeing it, or to lynch 'em at Lucchesa where it'll be a warning to all rogues, and gamblers, and abolitionists, that haven't the fear of God in their eyes, and do large business with the devil—that's what I aint yet detarmined about.” To lynching, altogether, Vernon absolutely objected; but he did not content himself with uttering moral objections only. With such a man as Jamison, such scruples might not have been so forcible as those which sprung from mere momentary policy. “We have not time for that,” said he in a whisper, and when out of hearing of the captives. “Besides, to go to Lucchesa with these in company, before we have beaten up the whole gang and obtained the proper evidence of their villainy, will be only to expose ourselves to discovery, prosecution, and probably punishment by the laws; not to speak of private assassination from the hands of some of the numerous outlaws with whom the whole country seems to be infested. To carry these fellows with us any where, would be to encumber ourselves with a burden that would be troublesome and may be dangerous. No! my counsel is that we bind them to trees in the most secret places in the swamp—there leave them till we can muster a sufficient force to secure them, and to pursue their comrades. We are now in possession of one of their signs, and if we can keep these fellows from communication with the rest, until we can penetrate their hiding-places, we may capture a good many more. I have already told you of friends on the other side of the river. We must join ourselves to them as soon as possible. You will set off to night. You know all that I can tell you about our friend Rawlins. Horsey and myself, meanwhile, will ride to Lucchesa, where I will see to some business which I have with Mr. Wilson, while he procures a horse and saddle for his wife. With him I will join you to-morrow, and with Rawlins, who I doubt not by this time has got a pretty strong party together, we will try what we can to capture the master spirit of the band. If we take him, we need give ourselves but little trouble about the rest. He is the chain that binds them together—and without him, they fall apart without strength, success, or object. We will rope these scoundrels to trees where they cannot see or communicate with each other, and lest they should employ our signals, it will not be amiss to put a handkerchief in their mouths.” “A handkerchief indeed!” cried Jamison,—“that would be a mighty foolish waste, when there's so much fine green moss to be had for the picking.” The economical views of Jamison prevailed, and the mouths of the struggling prisoners were well wadded with green moss in preference to silk bandannas. They were roped to trees in deep and dark recesses of the swamp; but it was not without great reluctance, that Jamison was persuaded to turn away, and forbear the use of a certain bunch of hickories, armed with which, he had prepared himself to requite the rogues for the offensive rebuke under which he had been compelled, after a fashion, to submit in the presence of Mr. Justice Nawls. Vernon saw that he was dissatisfied with the forbearance of his friends towards the criminals, which he thought as little due to their deserts, as to the cause of justice. They all rode from the place together to the high road, but the Alabamian was very taciturn as they rode; his mind seemed to be brooding over some yet undigested purposes. Their parting was evidently hurried on the side of Jamison; and when his two friends had gone from sight on their way to Lucchesa, the matter that troubled him, found expression in words aloud. “Grim! But I'd sooner sleep in the swamp myself, than let them chaps off without a licking. 'Tain't every day that a rogue gets what he deserves, and 'tain't every month that Dick Jamison cuts a bunch of hickories to throw away. It would be a most monstrous wasting of the wood, to cut a dozen hickories for nothing—besides, it's a mighty great resk to leave the fellows behind, any how: 'spose they get away—then, where's the satisfaction? No, no, that's not my notion—I must write a name on the backs of the critters, so that I may know 'em again, when I see 'em. Then, if they get away, 'twon't be so bad; and one person, that I know of, will be a mighty sight easier in his conscience. I reckon, if I did'nt lick 'em, my horse would go mighty rough over the road to-night—I know I shouldn't sit well in the saddle, and my spirits would be a cursed sight heavier than a fat parson's after a bad collection-Sunday.” This soliloquy was made while the speaker took his way back to the spot which he had just left. We need not add, that he carried out in execution, the sentiments and resolutions which it expressed. The hickories were not wasted; and, according to the usual ideas of border justice, in all parts of the world, the rascals met with their deserts. Satisfied with his administration of the border law, the Alabamian found the movement of his horse and conscience equally easy while he rode upon his way that night. He sat as well in his saddle as ever, and a heavy load, for the time being, was taken from his heart.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XX. “Take him to ye, And, sirrah, be an honest man; ye've reason; I thank ye, worthy brother: Welcome child, Mine own sweet child.” Beaumont and Fletcher. The impatient Saxon, impatient for his revenge, vainly looked out that night for the coming of his followers, to whom Vernon had been given in charge. His arrangements had been so made as to put his plans, seemingly, beyond the reach of disappointment; and, resolved effectually to arrest the farther efforts of an individual, whose courage and conduct gave him some reason for apprehension, he had prepared himself and his accessories in the swamp, for the summary and terrible punishment of one, whom they considered a spy and had destined to those cruel severities which, under their laws, had been decreed for such an offender. The evils which had followed the successful attempt of Richard Hurdis, had mortified the vanity of Saxon—or Clement Foster—and rendered him unforgiving. From the moment when he became convinced that Vernon was an enemy, he had solemnly sworn to destroy him. His plot for this purpose was a good one —his officers were true—the justice was his willing creature; and, Mr. Augustus Mortimer and Major Marcus Montmorenci, were, he well knew, the most trustworthy witnesses that were ever yet suborned to carry a crooked character straight through the sessions. How then should he account for the delay of his agents in bringing their prisoner to punishment? “Should it be that d—d actor, Jones—should he have spoiled the matter? Would you had put your knife and bullet through his carcass as well as through his clothes. I fear he will work us evil.” Such were his muttered doubts, at midnight, to his wily companion, who could say little to relieve them. “And this proud girl! She, too!—but it cannot be very long. She shall submit, if it be only to save the life of her lover. I shall obtain my conquest over her, though, as a condition, I am compelled to forego my vengeance upon him.” “But his life is forfeit to the law!” said Jones. “I am the law!” returned the other, haughtily. Then, softening his tones, he added—“but, I am too feverish, Jones, to be just or reasonable now. Forgive me if I speak hastily or harshly. Go you now, and see if there be any tidings of these fellows.” Meanwhile, Richard Stillyards, the dwarf, was already on his way to the upper ferry, as fast as he could go; and Vernon had reached Lucchesa in safety. His purpose in returning to Lucchesa was to declare himself in private to William Maitland; to reveal his whole connexion with Carter; to unfold the favourable terms which he was commissioned to grant, and, finally, to crown the work of peace and good will, by offering himself in marriage to Virginia, whose own consent, it has been already seen, he was happy to secure at an early period. But the misery of the father, and the deep feeling of interest which he too had in the matter, which VOL. II. 24 seemed almost to deprive the former of his reason, struck the lover dumb: “One stupid moment motionless he stood;” And then his resolution returned to him as he witnessed the old man's despair. The natural and nobler feelings of old Maitland's heart recovered all their strength at this moment of his greatest privation. Virginia was the apple of his eye—the solace of his bitter cup—the very light that relieved the otherwise groping darkness which had environed his affections. Bitterly did he now accuse himself of neglect, of cruelty, of crime—of all things and all thoughts evil,—while, as the anguished words poured from his lips, the big, burning tears rolled down his cheeks, on which, the consciousness of evil thoughts and deeds, had placed many a premature line and wrinkle. The younger daughter, wild and frightened rather than grieved, as she beheld these ebullitions of a nature which had never shown itself to her under such an aspect before, stood beside the old man, with one hand round his neck and one resting on his head. He himself sat upon the floor in a state of utter abandonment. “Cheer up and rouse yourself, sir,” exclaimed Vernon, as he looked upon the melancholy spectacle, with a sentiment of pity that became painful— “rouse up, sir, I will give her back to you though I perish.” “Will you? Oh! will you, Mr. Vernon?—God bless you if you will:—but I fear—I fear you cannot. She's gone—I've looked for her every where. It was I that left her for that accursed tavern, and those thrice accursed cards. I am not worthy of my child—my poor child. Oh! where can she be now—in what danger—what villains. Oh! God, keep me from that thought—God in mercy keep her from that danger.” And the miserable father threw himself forward upon the floor—the blood gushing from his nostrils, while his hands tore the scattered white hairs from his venerable head and strewed them around him. The screams of the trembling child mingled with his moans, making a discord which, while it filled the ears of Vernon, did not now so much annoy him. There were some evident fears, not so evidently expressed in the last speech of the father, which made the blood recede from the heart of Vernon, leaving a painful coldness and vacancy behind it. In what danger was Virginia now? What villain held her in his embraces—scorning her prayers, her tears, her trembling entreaties—her wild but feeble efforts at release? What brutal violence, sickening to chaste ears, assailed her gasping innocence: and none nigh to save by equal violence from that worse violence that defied the imploring service of every sweet, and soothing, and pure human affection? Vernon felt, as these dreadful doubts and apprehensions rushed through his mind, that he too could throw himself in utter abandonment upon the ground and mingle his groans also with those of the miserable father. But other feelings, strengthened by the blood-giving energies of youth, came to his aid. A fiercer power rose up in his heart, and with accents of recovered might, he repeated his assurance to the old man, that he would rescue and restore his daughter at the peril of his life. While he made this assurance, the pitiable prostration of the father struck him as not less discreditable to manhood, than it was grateful to his paternal love. Maitland was still a vigorous man—not too old for exertion—not too feeble at such a time, to seek for his child, and strike a desperate blow in her behalf. Besides, men were wanting now to prosecute the enterprise against the robbers in the Chitta Loosa, with whom Vernon could not fail to connect the outlaw by whom Virginia had been torn away from her dwelling. Circumstances had sufficiently shown the father that her absence arose from an abduction, which the whole tenor of Virginia's life and virtuous deportment conclusively convinced all parties, must have been forcible. A sudden resolution filled the mind of Vernon. He saw that no better mode remained of arousing the father to his duty, than by awakening other fears in his bosom. This was, indeed, the fitting moment to declare to him the full extent and powers of his own commission. To ordinary minds it might have seemed cruel, while the father so keenly suffered, to vex his spirit with the terrors of discovery and punishment; but the more correct philosophy of Vernon convinced him that the prostration and infirmity of Maitland could receive provocation and stimulant from no other source. “Mr. Wilson,” said he, “rise—send your daughter to her chamber for awhile, while I unfold to you some business of great importance. I am the bearer of other evil tidings which you have not yet heard, but which, sooner or later, must reach your ears. There can be no better season than the present.” The solemnity of these preliminaries had the effect of commanding the attention of the criminal. The daughter was sent from their presence, and the father rose slowly to his chair, with eyes full of a most painful anxiety. Vernon did not delay his communication with any idle formulæ—humanity forbade all such. It will be understood, however, that he omitted nothing which might soften the natural severity of truth, and maintain for himself the proper deportment of a gentleman, and one, too, so closely allied by the tenderest promises to the daughter of the person he addressed. “You are known to me, sir—you are William Maitland, late cashier of the — Bank.” The miserable old man shrieked in insuppressible terror at the words, while his hands clasped and covered his face. His daughter's fate was in an instant forgotten in his own. The selfishness of his nature preponderated in an instant. “Spare me, spare me, Mr. Vernon!—for God's sake—for my children's sake—spare me! I am a miserable old man—spare my gray hairs; and I will bless you for ever—they will bless you. Spare me!” Vernon took his hand kindly. “Be not alarmed, Mr. Maitland—though I come commissioned to recover this money from you, I yet come as your friend, and from one who has ever been your friend.” “Who! who!” exclaimed the wretched man, with as much eagerness of hope in his face as it had lately expressed of fear. But when the lips of Vernon uttered the name of “Carter,” his countenance fell—he sunk back in his chair with a deep groan, and again covered his face with his hands. “Do not doubt the friendship which has ever served you, even when the noble person whom I have mentioned has been suffering most from your injustice. I know your story, and I know his. I know how much you owe to his friendship, and I know how ill you have repaid it. But I am not sent to reproach you, and well I know, were he himself present, his own reproaches would be spared at such a moment as this. My mission brings you safety, Mr. Maitland, though I come as the messenger of justice. Hear me with patience, then, while I communicate to you the benevolent 24* designs of my friend—your friend, still, Mr. Maitland—in behalf of yourself and children.” This communication was soon delivered. The reader is already familiar with its purport. We need not repeat it here. As little necessary would it seem to say, that it was listened to by the undeserving criminal with some such feelings as those of the culprit under judicial sentence, suddenly relieved by an unlooked for respite from the supreme authority while standing on the very precipice of death. Vernon did not stop here, though the frequent groans and ejaculations of Maitland, now of remorse and self-reproach, and now of gratitude and exultation, subjected him to frequent interruptions. He at once unveiled to the old man the relation in which he stood to his lovely but lost daughter. Alas! for the long diseased heart, and the pampered and prevailing sin which possessed it! Even in that hour of his greatest privation, and pain, and humiliation—that hour of his partial relief from the fear of punishment—an hour distinguished alike by the keen sorrows of the father at the loss of the beloved child, and the abased feelings of the felon who suddenly finds himself convicted before man, without escape, and with his mouth choked with the bitter dust of his own degradation—in that very hour the shape of his old sin once more stood up triumphant and audacious as ever. The latter part of Vernon's communication, which declared the nature of the tie which now united his feelings and interests with those of Virginia Maitland, suggested to the miserable old man a new resource for his crime; and he eagerly insinuated proposals to Vernon that, instead of restoring the vast amount of moneys which he had purloined, and which he admitted himself still to have in great part in his own possession, to the rightful owners, they should retain it among themselves, and, by a timely and far retreat, secure themselves and it from the grasp of all pursuers. The infatuated gambler, whose moral sense, by a tendency as certain as death, had gone down, step by step, with rapid but self-unnoted transitions, to the lowest sink of depravation, vainly imagined that, to a lover, and one so young, the charms of a mistress, and the splendid bribe which formed her dowry, must prove irresistible temptations. Vernon shrank back with an apparent shudder from the grasp which the eager fingers of Maitland had taken upon his arm; while his eye regarded the stolid criminal with an expression quite as full of sorrow as of scorn. “Mr. Maitland, for your daughter's sake, I implore you to suffer me to respect her father if I can. Let me hear no more on this subject. I will strive, for my own sake, to forget this most humiliating offer—an offer no less insulting to me than it is degrading to yourself. You have heard me state what were Mr. Carter's propositions. You perceive that he is willing to provide—that he pledges himself to provide amply—for your children, on the restoration of the sums in your possession. Circumstances have favoured you, and have spared me the necessity of proceeding harshly. I count myself as singularly fortunate as yourself in being the messenger of such benevolent intentions on the part of one upon whom you have no claims of kindness. Carter, indeed, is a ruined man. Having carried out his designs, and secured your children in the sums specified, he will have no more left him than will barely suffice to make his friend Gamage secure against all losses. Let me know at once what is your resolution; for we have little time to lose. The safety of one who is now no less dear to me than to you, requires our instant pursuit.” Doubly humbled, though, perhaps, not yet contrite, Maitland acceded to all the requisitions of the youth, and, with a hurried consent, he would have dismissed the subject, while he proceeded to bustle forward to command the horses. But Vernon was one of those men who do their work thoroughly. “Mr. Maitland,” said he, “this matter must be settled to-night, and the money delivered. I have my credentials ready, and will prepare your guarantee, while you are getting things in readiness. If you are resolved to go with me in pursuit of Virginia, it will be your better course to order your barouche, and take Julia with us. The night is pleasant, and she can be wrapped up carefully. It will be better than to leave her here, in the care of servants only, and in a place which has already proved itself to be so very insecure. You can have no reason to dread returning now, and at Mr. Badger's she will be in perfect safety, while we traverse the swamp in search of her sister. I know no better course either for safety or propriety.” Briefly, Vernon had his own way in all respects. His firmness, mingled with that becoming deference of manner which youth always owes to age, even when it is criminal and debased, cowed the spirit and commanded the respect of Maitland. The money was restored, and in one hour more the cottage was deserted. The poor Julia, trembling and wondering, confused at all things, and almost totally inapprehensive of any, was wrapped away in the barouche, with her father beside her, sad, ashamed, and silent; while Vernon, mounted on horseback, and once more armed, after a long interval, with the weapons of which the sturdy Alabamian had taken such excellent charge during his arrest and sickness—with spirits unconsciously heightened by the sense of liberty and strength—rode alongside, and strove to cheer the miserable father and the innocent and unconscious child. Though his anxieties and apprehensions were in no respects lessened in regard to the lost Virginia, yet the conviction that he was now able to strike in her behalf, made him sanguine with hope, and rendered him elastic in movement. He suffered no unnecessary delays to restrain his progress, and by his voice and example, he urged the driver of the vehicle to a corresponding action with his own sinewy steed. The reader, if he be not more dull “than the fat weed That hugs itself at ease at Lethe's wharf,” will be pleased to spare us some unnecessary narration, and readily imagine a few things in our story which are quite as easy to conceive as to write. He will take it for granted that the progress of our night travellers was uninterrupted—and that a union was safely effected the next morning at a tolerably early hour between themselves and their friends Jamison and Horsey. He will farther learn that, shortly after the meeting of these with Vernon, they were joined by Walter Rawlins and Master Edward Mabry. The eyes of the latter, which the adroit fists of Horsey had sealed up for a season, were now in tolerably good condition— they wore less of the plethoric form and rainbow aspect, than they did a week past; but, though restored, they did not seem to regard the actor with any more favour than before. Some mutual efforts were made by Rawlins and Vernon to bring the parties to friendly offices; but they were partly ineffectual. Still, there was no open show of hostility between them. Horsey, certainly, preserved none. He was a generous fellow at heart; and would have scorned to have fostered any feeling of malice at an enemy. Besides, he had been successful, and as those always laugh who win, his good humour was in no wise diminished, because the hand which he offered with frankness to his foe was taken with reluctance. He disarmed the active rancour of Mabry, by making some concessions—without which it might have been that the operations of the party would have been exposed to conflicting feelings and divided counsels— which he was neither bound by courtesy nor expected by his opponent to make. As for Rawlins, his delight at seeing Vernon was excruciating. He hugged him to his breast with what seemed to the latter quite a superfluous degree of affection, and in the same breath, though in a whisper, told him that Rachel had at length yielded to his persuasions, and had consented to name the day. Another matter of far more gratifying import to Vernon at this moment, was the information which he received of a new ally in the person of Stillyards, the dwarf. That elegant young person, elated with the boon with which Florence Marbois had consented to reward his industry in promoting her purposes of vengeance, had made his appearance at the door of Rawlins, a little after daylight that very morning; and his communications had quickened the preparations of the latter for the pursuit of that enterprise to which the counsels of Vernon had before impelled him. He had not been idle, it may be said here, during the interval which had passed. He had secured the co-operation of nearly twenty men—all stout fellows—good men and true—whom the blast of a horn would bring together in half an hour, from a circuit of five miles. The revelations of Stillyards had much more effect upon Vernon than they could possibly have had upon Rawlins. The abduction of Virginia Maitland was now known with certainty; and it was with no less certainty that he knew where she was hidden by Saxon. It was no small addition to his desire for immediate enterprise, when he found that her ravisher, and the consummate chief of the Beagles of the Border, were one and the same person. These discoveries he kept from the father. He had come to the conclusion that William Maitland could be of little service in the adventure—and he counselled him to proceed at once with Julia to the security of Zion's Hill. He particularly cautioned him against suffering his own near neighbourhood to be known to the venerable and dogmatical head of the establishment; still less to suffer it to be suspected that any enterprise was on foot, by which to rout the outlaws. To render the old man more cautious in this and every other respect, the doubtful character of young Badger was revealed to him, and the danger fully shown of any premature development of a project which could only be successful through perfect secrecy. Having sent the unhappy and criminal father upon his way, Vernon proceeded to the examination of Stillyards, whom Rawlins had kept under close watch in the neighbouring wood.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XXI. “She scorn'd us strangely, All we could do, or durst do; threatened us With such a noble anger, and so governed With such a fiery spirit.” Bonduca. Though naturally impatient to commence the war against his enemies and rescue the fair Virginia from her abductors, Vernon was too thoughtful and deliberate of character to defeat his own objects by any premature or precipitate attempts. He retired as soon as possible into the cover of the forests and from sight of any but his own comrades, after sending Maitland on his way to Zion's Hill. Here he closely examined the dwarf Stillyards; and this done, he despatched Jamison with two others for the purpose of bringing in, and more effectually securing the persons of the two rogues, whom we left fastened in the swamp the night before. There were two other rogues to be secured of whose neighbourhood he was now first informed by the dwarf. These were fellows, who, in the “Beagle” dialect, went by the significant name of “smellers.” They were, in fact, advanced sentinels, the keepers of outposts, watching the highways leading to the swamp fastnesses, and conveying the earliest tidings of the approach of any uncongenial or hostile influences. To divert these watchers from their posts, Stillyards, whom they knew, was immediately sent forward, as if with instructions from their captain. Being in possession of all the first signs of the band, there could be little or no difficulty in deceiving them by means of his agency; and not altogether prepared to rely wholly upon a rogue, even in the hour of his first conversion, Vernon sent Rawlins, secretly, with two others—all excellent woodmen—to follow the dwarf, and correct his treachery, should he happen to prove faithless to his trust. But his precautions, though proper, proved unnecessary. Stillyards was now the sworn enemy of the outlaw chief on his own account, even if he were not bound as the agent of Florence Marbois. The humiliating indignity to which his ears had been subjected by the fingers of Saxon had turned all the sweet milk of his nature into gall and bitterness; and he was now prepared, without fee or reward, to prove to his superior the extent of that malignity, which, in the base spirit, never forgives a wrong, and in the weakly, vain heart never forgets a slight. The wish to prove his capacity for vengeance, to him who was to be the object of it, had kept the deformed absolutely sleepless; and it was with the keenest and most suspicious impatience that he heard the resolution of Vernon to make no movement, until night, against the outlaws of Cane Castle. This resolution was productive of surprise to other minds than his. Rawlins himself wondered, that, with a body of stout, fearless men, which, at mid-day, exceeded in numbers the entire force of the beagles known to be then within their camp, he should forbear instantly proceeding towards their prey. But the determination of the leader was a judicious one; and when explained to the few comrades whom he trusted VOL. II. 25 with his plan, its evident policy overcame all their scruples and disarmed their doubts. It was not till the evening shadows had fallen that their movements were begun. Before this time, however, the party which had been despatched for the two prisoners had returned with their charge; while, with equal success, the dwarf Stillyards, had beguiled the “Smellers” from their station into the very hands of the attacking party. Before they knew where they were, they encountered a dozen armed men in front, while the three who had been despatched to follow Stillyards, seasonably arriving behind, cut off all chance of retreat. The four were despatched under an equal party towards Zion's Hill, in time to reach it, a few hours after dark. They conveyed a request from Vernon to the venerable elder of that establishment, that they might be suffered to remain under guard at his retreat, until the return of the party the next day. Having several miles the start of the Methodist, it was no longer a cause of fear that their plans might be defeated either by the perverse self-esteem and dogmatism of the father, or the treachery of the son; of whom, by the way, Rawlins had meanwhile gathered such knowledge from Rachel Morrison, as confirmed all his previous suspicions. These minor matters attended to, Vernon set his party in motion as soon as the darkness was sufficient to conceal their movements. But instead of taking his way down, he advanced up the river, and in a course directly opposite to that where Cane Castle lay. Two miles above the place where he had been concealed through the day, was the ferry which he had that morning crossed, and while crossing, had scanned curiously, yet in silence, the place where the boat was fastened, and as much of the scene and circumstances around him as he deemed effectual to his purposes. Having reached the neighbourhood, he ordered his party to halt in the woods, while, alighting from their horses, Rawlins, Jamison, and himself, went forward to reconnoitre. Finding the coast clear, they loosened the ferry-boat from its fasts. This boat—a huge flat, suited to the transportation of wagons of the largest dimensions across the river—soon received the party without their horses. These were sent to await them, under the charge of a couple of the troop, to a spot, on the same side of the river seven miles below, which was described to be directly opposite to that where the outlaws held their abode. Under the guidance of Rawlins, who knew the river, and Stillyards, to whom the upper shore was sufficiently familiar, the flat was suffered noiselessly to fall down with the current; the only toil of the party being to push her off when she touched the shore, and keep her free from the snags and sawyers —a task not so easy to execute in the imperfect starlight, which guided them in their progress. But they experienced fewer difficulties than Vernon had anticipated, and arrived at the spot already known to the reader by the fishing adventure of Horsey, in perfect secrecy and silence. The flat was now run up, and suffered to rest upon the oozy plane which skirted the river and lay between it and Cane Castle; and through this bog, the most toilsome and unpleasant part of their journey, the little troop were compelled to scramble —the silence imposed upon Horsey at this juncture, being the worst portion of the business to that worthy amateur. The restraint he found excessively irksome, at a moment and in a place, which reminded him of some of his strangest experience, and of events which had been sufficiently exciting to himself to make him sure of the dramatic effect which they must produce in the minds and estimation of all others. It did not alter the case very materially that he had discoursed over his experience to several of his present comrades more than once already. All day he had exercised his tongue in the reminiscences, always pleasant when past, of peril and annoyance: still, some had not heard—and then, the minutiæ! “It is in the little touches, my dear fellow,” he said to Vernon, in a whisper—“the nice and seemingly unimportant features of a subject, that the whole character speaks out. A look, a nod, a wink, or the slightest gesture in the proper place, makes all the difference in the world—makes eloquent the commonest passages of the poet, which the ordinary reader would slur over in impatience.” “Be a man now, not an actor, Horsey. Every thing in season,” was the stern response of Vernon, in a like whisper. “He is neither man nor actor who cannot keep his tongue, when the part actually calls for silence.” “You're right in that, by the ghost of Solomon, Harry Monmouth;” and as the actor contented himself with this reply, he sunk back, murmuring from one of his favourites— “This is no world To play with mammets, and to tilt with lips: We must have bloody noses, and crack'd crowns, And pass them current too;—” A reflection, we may add, that only distressed him as he thought how awkward he should look, appearing a second time, with a bloody nose before Mary Stinson, otherwise Mrs. Horsey. He was beguiled from his annoyances, however, by finding that the next person at his side was Master Edward Mabry, his late rival. This discovery led him to some vague musings about coincidences, from which he was only aroused by the summons, which sent him forward with three others, for the capture of his quondam companion, Jones; a summons which enlivened and gratified him greatly, as it seemed to imply some retributive agency in Providence, which thus left open the door to an atonement for all the indignities of Mr. Aristophanes Bull, and the ruin of his Hamlet. He followed Rawlins, to whom Stillyards had given particular directions for finding the sleeping-place of that sturdy outlaw; while five others, equally well instructed, were commissioned for the capture of the rest of the gang. Vernon, reserving to himself the dwarf Stillyards, only, took his way with a cautious step, but a bounding heart, towards the squatter's hovel, where he had been told by his companion that the maiden was imprisoned. His command to the rest of his party was, that the followers of Saxon should be surprised and captured;—a more sudden, if not more severe doom he purposed for the outlaw himself. For him the sudden shot or stroke was designed, as from him was anticipated the most reckless and resolute resistance. Meanwhile, the commotion at Zion's Hill, inspired by the astounding intelligence brought by those who escorted the captured outlaws, was such as might have been expected from the vexed self-esteem of the venerable veteran. The attempt of Vernon and Rawlins to effect so important a business without his agency, was a source of equal surprise and indignation. That Rawlins should be so presumptuous, was monstrous in the extreme; and what made it seem more so, was the fact, that in all his schemes and counsels, submitted from time to time to the latter, after the departure of Vernon, it seemed to the dictatorial elder, that the woodman was uncommonly 25* obtuse and wretchedly deficient in honourable enterprise. His son, Gideon, on the contrary, by the boldness of his expressions, and the warmth of valour which he displayed whenever the capture of the “Beagles” was the subject, had doubtless commended himself to the old man's heart. He even began to think, after making due comparisons between the two on this subject, that it would be only a legitimate right which he had as a guardian of Rachel Morrison, and a becoming exercise of his wisdom, to urge his wishes upon her that she should marry a youth of so much more promise, and discard one of whom so few expectations could be formed. He had forborne any attempt hitherto, to bias her affections; but to one who assumed to himself so large a portion of the allotted sagacity of mankind, it began to seem perfectly proper and praiseworthy to employ it in his own way, for the use of one, who still toiled in a sort of moral darkness and among the shadows of ignorance. His first attempts at this sort of jurisdiction, were, however, moderate enough. He began by reproaches of Rawlins for his indirection and infirmity of purpose, and a recommendation, only implied, however, of the worthy and valiant Gideon. “What Walter Rawlins can mean,” he remarked to Rachel one morning shortly after the woodman had taken his departure, “by keeping his hands from the good work, I do not understand. Surely he lacks not heart,—he hath courage for strife. There hath been no shrinking hitherto, on his part, in the hour of danger.” “He has courage, believe me,” was the reply of Rachel, with the natural and unrestrained warmth of one who loves without doubt or qualification. “There is no man of more courage on the river.” “It would please me to think so, Rachel—nay, I have thought so, but a short while since; yet, to say truth, I have my misgivings. Why is he backward to stir up the people when I bid him? Why, when the occasion is so pressing—when evil men gather with deadly weapons in their hands, and deadly malice in their hearts, as I may say it, around the holy places of the Lord; and the innocent traveller is waylaid for his spoil; and they fear not to smite the unoffending, and the unprepared, and the innocent— why doth he keep himself aloof at such a time— how may he justify himself for such slackness of spirit? Were he feeble of limb, and slight of person, it were, perhaps, to be forgiven him that he is backward; but he hath a strength beyond that of ordinary men, and with a fitting strength of heart, there would seem to be no justification for this lukewarmness. Truly, Rachel, it humbleth me much—this falling off in our friend.” “There is no falling off, dear uncle, believe me. I will answer for Walter, that when the fitting time shall arrive, he will be ready, and among the first.” “When the fitting time shall arrive!” was the exclamation of the elder. “Have I not said to thee and to him, already, that now is the time and the season? Now! now! Can there be a better hour than the first for the good performances of a man, and those which are so needful for human safety? He hath heard my thought more than once already, in behalf of this necessity.” “But, if he thinks otherwise!” was the imprudent reply of the maiden—her anxiety for the justification of her lover, making her forgetful of the mortal stab which such a suggestion must give to the old gentleman's conceit of heart. His hands and eyes were uplifted in unmitigated astonishment. “Ha! It is so, then, even as I expected. He hath better assurances of wisdom and the truth than older men—nay, than all men around; for all men seem to hold it needful that the outlaw should be arrested, out of hand, in his deeds of evil. He thinks otherwise, doth he? He will tell us when it is the fitting season, will he? He is good and wise, but it is unfortunate that we must do without him. We must content ourselves with the strength we have, and only pray to the Lord that it may be equal to the work before us—that we may go forward without faintness of heart or slackness of spirit, and that success may be vouchsafed to us, not because of the strength which we have, but the will for the performance.” “Oh, my uncle, speak not thus harshly—think not thus unkindly of Walter;” responded the maiden, now fully awake to her indiscretion as she listened to this outpouring of the morbid vanity of age. “You do Walter injustice; I'm sure you do; and he'll be ready to go with the rest, as soon as ever they're ready. He may think it too soon, but I'm sure, when you once set the example, and name the day, he'll be among the first to turn out at your summons.” A reply no less bitter than the former answered this additional speech of Rachel; and was followed up by a sneering comment of Master Gideon Badger, who made his appearance while the controversy was in progress. He muttered some general remark about the not unfrequent incompetency of the soul to the frame which enclosed it; and concluded with assuring his father that mere bulk or even numbers were not so necessary as spirit and resolution for the adventure which they had in view. “And the sanction of God, my son,” said the now approving father. The eye of Rachel Morrison turned upon the hypocritical Gideon, with an expression of fiery scorn which he shrunk to encounter. Her heart swelled within her with a feeling of indignant resistance as she replied, addressing herself only to the son— “I can answer equally for the spirit and frame of Walter Rawlins, Gideon Badger, and will warn you in season how you provoke either.” “Rachel Morrison!” exclaimed the old man sternly—“would you threaten Gideon with the violence of a stranger?” “A stranger, uncle—Walter Rawlins a stranger! —Has it then come to this?—But if he is a stranger to you, sir, as indeed he seems to be, from the manner in which you speak and think of him, he is yet no stranger to me. I can answer equally for his strength and courage. As for threatening Gideon with them, I had no such thought—but I thought it prudent to warn him against offending either. Walter is patient enough, but he is young, and he is human; and when human passions are treated with scorn, they are very apt to rise in resentment. I respect the courage of Walter sufficiently to make me think it would not be safe for Gideon to doubt it in his hearing.” “In a good cause, and with God's blessing,” said the devout young man, “I have little fear of him or of any other person.” “And with such principles, Gideon, my son, you need have no fear. The gates of hell shall not prevail against him who goes forth armed by God's favour, and in the prosecution of the just war of truth. It is even such a war as this, which Walter Rawlins thinks it not yet a seasonable time to begin; but, as you have already said, we need not numbers in a righteous cause. God will provide—God will strengthen—God will see that numbers even shall not be wanting, in the hour when the banner is to be raised and the blows are to be struck; and if I have a sorrow because of the absence of Walter Rawlins from this conflict, it is because of his own great loss therefrom.” “He will not be absent!” exclaimed Rachel Morrison—“I know he will go in search of these robbers, when the time comes, so far ahead of some others, that even their eyes will not dare to follow him.” This sarcasm was felt by Gideon, but passed the old man without attracting his notice; an escape which no doubt saved the damsel a lecture on presumption of heart, and pride of opinion, and some dozen more of the vital sins of ignorance and presumption. The arrival of the captured outlaws, and the message from Rawlins—events which took place only two days after this dialogue—while they completely justified the warm confidence of the maiden in the manhood of her lover, as completely confounded the stern old Methodist, and baffled all his estimates of character. Not that he thought any better of Walter Rawlins than before. If forced to believe him brave and ready now, he was at least thoroughly vexed with the audacity that dared to undertake a business so important without his cooperation, Nay—not only without his co-operation, but actually, with a studious reservation from him of a task in which his own threatened performances were to be the most conspicuous of all human adventures. His self-complacency did not permit him to imagine, for a single instant, the true reason why he should be kept from the knowledge of a scheme, the object of which he had as sincerely and notoriously at heart, as any body else; and it would have been very difficult to persuade him—the fact is not easy of belief—that a dogmatical old man is of all others the greatest obstacle to the progress of any business, where young men are to be the performers. That Badger would have rejected every plan but his own, for the capture of the robbers, and spoiled any that might be undertaken, the shrewd sense of Vernon perceived in the first hour of their acquaintance; and the doubts which were entertained of the fidelity of the son, naturally combined to strengthen his objections to any participation of the father in the business. His views of the subject have been already given to the reader. The exultation of Rachel Morrison may be imagined, when these proofs of the courage of her Walter were produced—an exultation which spoke in tearful eyes, and a trembling and bounding heart. Old Badger, as one of the quorum, and one learned in the law—in all laws—clothed in official authority, and no less delighted with, than conscious of, the the power which it conferred, was—however angry with the captors—not unwilling to take into custody the captive outlaws. He secured them under good locks and keys, having first taken the precaution, with the assistance of the detachment under whose guard they came, of roping them to some very heavy articles of furniture. The two soi disant constables were bound, with upward-looking eyes, on the flat of their backs, tête-à-tête, to a dresser of prolonged dimensions, but not so long, as, when the rogues were stretched upon it, to admit of a support to their legs, which were, in consequence, suffered to dangle from it, only in partial possession of their wonted liberty. They could kick the wall or each other, at either end of the board, but to these limited exercises they were unequivocally restrained. If the other two were not equally well cared for, it was their misfortune—they were certainly equally well fastened. It needs not that we should describe the particular privileges of their situation. Two of the guard were reserved to keep watch over them until the proper officers of the law could be got in requisition, while the other two were dismissed, at their own request, that they might rejoin the attacking party that night, and before the descent was made upon the camp of the outlaws. After dismissing them, which he did in no very ceremonious or friendly manner, old Badger was suddenly seized with the conviction that he should have gone himself. His amour propre was interested to lead in an expedition for which his past acquaintance with the wars, and his present connexion with “the peace,” seemed equally to constitute a peculiar justification of his claim. Besides, had he not been beating up recruits for this very expedition? Were not some of them in the neighbourhood—could they not be easily mustered? There was Gideon and himself—Joe Tompkins, the hired ploughboy, Nicodemus Root, the schoolmaster, who, though a Yankee, was able to ride and shoot, and had done execution more than once at pigeon-distance. A timely use of the six or seven hours remaining between that and daylight, would enable him easily to muster up some half a score; and with these the veteran was not unwilling, in a fair day, and after due preliminaries of prayer and fasting, to face all the outlaws between the Alabama and Arkansas. From the guard that brought in the prisoners, he had been led to believe that the party of Vernon would not commence the march before dawn; and as he had no thought of the use which might be made of the ferry-boat in such an expedition, he took it for granted, that hard riding would bring him to the post of danger in season for all its honours. This new course of thought led to instant preparations, which need to be adverted to only. They do not affect our expedition at this moment. But when his plans had to be carried out, the venerable elder discovered that one of his chief agents was reported missing. This was his own son, the worthy Gideon, who was no less confounded than his father at the developments of the night. If the old man was vexed and mortified, Gideon was terrified. The danger was at his very door. The rascals who were taken, knew him as a confederate, and in the very presence of the old man exhibited those secret signs of intelligence which made the profligate youth's heart quake within him, though he sufficiently preserved his equilibrium to return them. The keen eyes of Rachel Morrison beheld his consternation, and her piercing and suspicious glance did not fail to perceive that there was some communion even then going on between the parties. Gideon, with every additional moment of reflection, fancied the danger to be increasing. He knew that the outlaws looked to him for assistance; nay, looked to him to liberate them;—and also remembered some of the painful conditions which were coupled with his association with the Beagles. He was sworn to convey the tidings of danger to his comrades in the swamp. Their arrest almost necessarily led to his own. The discovery of their secrets involved his safety; and what security could he have against the revelations of frightened rogues at the foot of the gallows? He was divided between conflicting fears and desires. It was important to rescue the outlaws already in custody— it was equally, if not more important, to counsel those in the swamp of their approaching danger. A few moments' reflection determined him to address himself exclusively to the latter object. The danger VOL. II. 26 of the prisoners was not immediate. They were yet to be committed for trial, and a considerable stretch of time lay between the present and the period assigned for the County Court Sessions. If the beagles in the swamp continued free, it would be no very difficult matter to rescue the prisoners at some more favourable moment; and the only evil would be their temporary detention in confinement. He was well assured that such hardy rogues would never make their confessions a moment sooner than was necessary. That the beagles in the swamp were prepared for their enemies was very probable, and yet a promptness, spirit, and vigilance, such as had already been shown by the assailing party, rendered important every measure of precaution, and demanded the instant activity of every member of the fraternity. Vernon and Rawlins were obviously men to be feared, and the reader has already seen that Gideon Badger was one of those men who are soonest to “despair their charm.” He wanted “the natural hue of courage,” and his fears on the present occasion, even exaggerated the danger, pressing as it really was. To give a sign to the outlaws in custody, significant of his resolution to serve them, and to slip from the apartment unobserved, even before his father had yet dismissed the two men of Rawlins's party who had brought in the prisoners, were the first steps of Gideon after he had concluded upon his course. The venerable Methodist, with eyes shut and hands uplifted, was too busy delivering a searching sermon to the prisoners and their captors, alike, to observe the movements of the son. But they were seen by the keen eyes of the damsel, who already knew enough of the truth to comprehend the condition of Gideon's mind, and to anticipate his probable course. She followed him silently from the apartment, and traced his steps to the foot of the garden. She came up with him as he was about to cross the fence, and called him instantly by name. “Gideon! Gideon Badger!” How shrunk his heart in terror at the sound—the sound of his own name uttered by the lips of a woman! But at that moment he knew not whose lips uttered it, and it was a sound of terror. His apprehensions had rendered his senses dull to discriminate, however acute in the appreciation of all sights and accents. The summons seemed full of terror, and it was not till she approached and he turned full upon her that he felt relieved. “Gideon,” she said, “go not if you would be safe. I warn you, stay where you are—you are in danger if you leave Zion's Hill.” “In danger, Rachel—in danger, my pretty cousin!” he replied, with some show of recovered impudence, if not courage, in his manner—“why, what should be the danger that I must apprehend, unless it be that to which I have been so long exposed? My danger is from you, Rachel—you only.” He would have taken her hand as he spoke, with an air of excessive familiarity, but she repulsed him and drew back at his approach, with a manner, the evident aversion of which brought a burning flush upon his cheek. “This is no time,” she said coldly, “for these follies; and least of all is it a season for you to indulge in them. Hear me, Gideon—I am in possession of your secrets—I can guess where, even now, you would bend your steps. You go to warn the robbers in the swamp of the danger that awaits them.” “Ha!” It was all he spoke, and his teeth almost chattered in the utterance. “Yes—it is known to me—the dreadful tie that binds you to these miserable men. I have heard you in speech with their leader, and others of the band. They are in danger—you cannot show them this, without involving yourself in their danger, and it is beyond your power to save them. Stay where you are—or, if you leave Zion's Hill, let me counsel you to take a course far different from that you intend to-night. Fly to the eastward—I will keep your secret, and do my best to get the means for you from my uncle.” “Rachel, you must really care for me. This friendly revelation,—this pursuit of me—this interest in my fortunes—this care for my safety, sufficiently prove it. Be mine, dear Rachel, and I will do as you counsel—I will fly from this confederacy—I will go with you where you please.” “This is only trifling, Gideon—you should know me better. I have already told you that I am pledged to another.” “But you do not love him—you cannot—nay,— can I doubt your feeling of preference for me after this proof. It is midnight—the darkness of the night and forest are around us—yet you seek me to counsel me against danger; you—” “God help you to wiser thoughts, Gideon. Is it not enough that you are the only child of that uncle who has been a father to me? Is this not sufficient reason why I should seek to keep you from danger, and him from misery?” “I must believe there is yet another and a better reason. I am sure, Rachel, that we can be happy together.” “Never! never!” she exclaimed, with impetuous energy, as, provoked by the insolent self-complaisance of his tone and manner, she wrested from him the hand which he had partially taken in his grasp. “Flatter yourself with no such idle fancies, Gideon Badger. Happiness with you is impossible. Sooner shall the heavy sod lie upon my bosom, and I not feel it, than I yield myself up to the hope or to the chance of finding happiness in any closer connexion with you than now. Even now, I pain to look upon you as I must daily, and see you as I do, and know you as you are!” “Rachel Morrison, you have determined your own fate. You know too much for your safety and for mine. My security henceforward must be in securing you. You have been at some pains to pry into my secrets—to follow me here and there, and become a party to those concerns in which you were required to take no part. This proves that you have sufficient interest in my fortunes to justify me in forcing a portion of them upon you. You are right—I am about to join the beagles in the swamp. It is useless now to deny to you that I am one of them. You must go with me. You must be mine from this instant. Your own lips have sealed your doom. Your man, Rawlins, is not here to save you now.” He advanced upon her as he spoke. She retreated a pace and spoke with tones of coolness and deliberation—tones which trembled only from the aroused energies of her spirit. “You are mistaken, Gideon Badger. I am prepared for this. It is you that have sealed your doom, or will seal it, if you advance another step towards me. If the man, Walter Rawlins—he is a man, Gideon Badger!—if he be not here to save me, he has left me that with which I shall save myself. One of his pistols is now in my hand—loaded by him and left at my request—with a fearful conviction that it might be necessary at some such moment as the present. Your threats have thus prepared me; I have learned the use of the weapon, and as I hope 26* still to maintain the whiteness of my soul to the last I am resolved to use it against yourself, sooner than suffer you to sully the purity of mine. You know me well enough, Gideon Badger, to know that I will as solemnly execute the resolution which I have so solemnly made! Now, approach me with violence, if you dare.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XXII. “Such a life, Methinks, had metal in it to survive An age of men.” George Chapman. The solemn accents, the deliberate, resolved tone of the maiden, not less than the energetic language which she used, would have impressed a much bolder person than Gideon Badger with the danger of trifling with such a spirit. It was evident that all was serious and composed earnestness in her mind; and her words derived no emphasis, or very little, from the exhibition of the pistol, and the click of the lock as it distinctly sounded under her fingers. To the dastard soul of Gideon Badger it struck a sentiment of fear which at once disarmed him of his insolence and arrested his approach. But a moment before he had persuaded himself that he should be able to carry her in safety to the swamp. He had no sort of doubt that the beagles would escape the pursuit of Rawlins' party, even if they remained uncounselled by himself; for, well apprised of the numberless ramifications and resources of the fraternity, he did not fear but they would be advised of the approach of the enemy by at least a dozen out-sentries. How easy to find shelter with them for Rachel Morrison; and there, secure from pursuit, and having her entirely in his power and at his mercy, what should hinder the consummation of any, even of his worst purposes? Such was the precious scheme which his mind conceived from the first moment that night when Rachel appeared upon the scene. Such was the scheme which her masculine resolution and her foresight so easily defeated. Gideon Badger was not calculated to be a magnificent villain. He was a petty rascal only. In a city like New York he would have made an excellent auction-dealer—one of those cunning gentry, that sell baubles by the lot, and bluster when you refuse to keep your hasty purchases. Still, base as was his nature, he felt the meanness of his present position. Incapable of pressing his villany to the utmost, he would have ascribed his abortive attempt to merriment only. With a laugh, which did not altogether disguise the tremulous tone of his voice, he said: “Why, Rachel, you seem to think that I was serious—at least you are grown serious yourself. And so you actually go armed? That, of all things, is the strangest! Why should you go armed? What would you do with a loaded pistol, I should like to know?” “Use it for my protection, Gideon, if I found any one seriously bent to assail me,” was the cool reply. “But you could not have supposed that I would do such a thing, Rachel!” “I do—indeed, I know that you would if you dared. It is well for both of us, Gideon, that you are not quite so resolute as you are wicked.” “You speak plainly, Rachel,” was the hoarse reply. “It is best,” answered the maiden; “it is for your safety that I have spoken thus plainly. Hear me, Gideon, while I speak more plainly yet. To save you from a great peril, I have ventured into these woods at this hour of the night, in spite of the fears and scruples which are so natural to my sex—” “And of which your own share seems unaccountably small,” was the sneering interruption of her companion. “That is as you think,” was the composed reply. “Small or great, they were sufficient to have kept me back from this interview, but that I was resolved to add one more effort to those I have already made, to save you from the dangers into which you are yet resolved to fall.” “You are very kind—very benignant.” She did not heed the impertinence of this speech, or its equally impertinent manner, as she proceeded— “Yet, not because I had care or interest in you, Gideon Badger, did I take these pains, or incur a risk, which your own conduct has just assured me was no small one—but for that good old man, your father, who has been more than a father to me, and whose gray hairs would go down to the grave in wretchedness, did any mishap or dishonour reach his son. I do not seek to save you from the danger so much as I seek to spare him the sorrow and the shame. You have shown yourself too little careful of my feelings, Gideon, during our long acquaintance, to deserve much at my hands either of respect or kindness. On the contrary, since we have reached maturity, I have known you by your persecutions—by your ungenerous persecutions—rather than by any more commendable qualities or conduct. Still, I would save you—from your comrades, from yourself, from the laws which you have outraged, and which you are now about to outrage. I have kept your secret from your father, from Rawlins, from all—I have restrained, though with great difficulty, another from declaring it. I now tell you, Gideon, solemnly here and seriously, that if you go this night into the swamp, you go into unnecessary danger. I have a presentiment, Gideon, that you go never to return.” He would have ridiculed her counsels and her fears. He made an attempt to laugh at her solemnity, but the effort degenerated into a lugubrious chuckle, that died away in a hoarse whisper in his throat. “Tell me what you know,” he at length exclaimed, in a tone of emphatic utterance which sufficiently declared his apprehensions—“speak not to me of your presentiments, and all that sort of superstitious nonsense, but tell me what you have heard—what you know. Come,—you have it all from your man, Rawlins;—if you really desire to serve my father, and to save me, his dutiful son, to his embraces, let me know what the plan is for the catching of the beagles. A word, Rachel Morrison, a single word of positive assurance will do more than all your conjectures, superstitions, and fancies. Speak that word, and I remain at Zion's Hill—I remain with you.” “With me!—But no! I will speak no bitterness, Gideon, in this moment, when your life and my hope may equally rest upon the verge of a dreadful precipice.” “Your hope and my life! What mean you? I do not understand the connexion.” “Nor will I explain it, Gideon. The only warning which I am willing that you shall understand is one that I am willing to repeat. Your insolent words, tone, and manner, shall not make me less desirous of your safety; since nothing that you can say or do, can make me lose sight of what I owe to your venerable father.” “Oh, this is all talk, Rachel. Can you, or will you tell me nothing of these handsome fellows that are so valiantly resolved to pursue my comrades into the swamp? You see, I admit them to be comrades. You have proved yourself so close a keeper of the secret heretofore, that I cannot hesitate in confiding to you my admission of the truth. I tell you, therefore, that I am sworn to go to the swamp to-night—sworn to myself and them—to convey the intelligence of the danger which is supposed to threaten them. I am bound to them for this. My safety —my very life depends upon it. If I fail them, they have their laws and penalties, to which those of society are but toys—the merest trifles that ever yet assumed the features of danger to the eyes of man. Now, Rachel, let me but clearly see that there is an occasion for your caution, and I will not go. I will have an excuse which shall secure me from the penalties of any violated oath.” “Father in Heaven! and can it be, Gideon Badger, that you are so fearfully related to these men?” “Pshaw! Rachel—you waste time with these interjections,” replied the youth with tones of dogged impatience. “To the point—to the point. Is there present danger to me, and what is its form—whence comes it—from whom—where? To that—to that, Rachel. Speak to that.” “Have I not said—have you not heard? Surely you do not despise the attempts which Walter Rawlins and Mr. Vernon are now making? You have heard the men that brought in the prisoners?” “Surely I know all this, Rachel Morrison, but I thought you knew more. Knowing this, I yet resolve to go. As for the danger, set your heart easy on that subject. By the dawn, when your gallant is in motion for the swamp, I shall be at Zion's Hill again, or so near it, as to smell the breakfast; and the beagles will be so far on their way from the place of danger, that their nests will be cold enough when the hunters arrive. So, Rachel, if you will not think better of it, and go with me—I renew my offer—the best counsel I can give you is, to get to bed as soon as you may, and dream of more evil for Gideon Badger. It will be easy to dream of that which we sincerely wish.” “I wish you nothing but good, Gideon, and once more warn you not to go into the swamp to-night. There is blood upon the path. Something tells me it will be fatal to you if you go.” “Unless you go with me, Rachel. Nay, why will you be so stubborn? You know not what you lose, Rachel. Joys of which you never dreamed, and—” “Go! evil son of a worthy father—go!” was the stern interruption of the maiden, as she turned from the reprobate. “You obey a written destiny. God will not suffer you to be saved by so feeble an instrument as I.” The solemnity of these tones sounded like a trumpet in the ears of the dissolute youth, and the feeling of awful conviction which lay at the heart of Rachel Morrison, and which impressed her with the faith that no farther effort could help him who had been delivered over to his doom by the fiat of Heaven, for a moment impressed itself also upon the soul of the person whom it chiefly interested. But this feeling was not suffered to obtain more than a moment's ascendency. The coward is frequently rash through a consciousness of his own cowardice, and the conviction that he really trembles, leads him to resolve upon a course which should convince the spectator that he was never more courageous in his life. He laughed at the omens which made him shudder, and mocked at the warning which terrified him. He strove to shroud his apprehensions in his ribaldry, and his last words to the maiden consisted in a renewal of his proposition to share with him the licentious life of the swamp; the freedom from all restraint, which, to his mind, seemed the very acme of human freedom and felicity. She answered his proposition by a prayer contained in a single sentence, which increased the awe that dwelt within his heart. “Cut him not off in his sins. Oh, God! smite him not suddenly in thy anger.” He disappeared in that instant. He had not the spirit to respond to this. Meanwhile, the reader must not suppose that the business in the swamp remained at a stand. On the contrary, never were men more alert to do execution in an enemy's country, than the worthy fellows under their several leaders, Rawlins, Jamison, and the amateur. The latter, however, resolute as any of the rest, when he reached the spot where he had lost his every-day habiliments, could not resist the temptation of giving to his little band, a brief narrative of those afflicting events and the other circumstances that followed his arrival in the swamp, and his connexion with that arch-beagle, Jones. At another moment it might amuse the reader, who is already familiar with these circumstances, to hear Horsey relate them. His story would seem a very different one from ours. Nay, the two would scarce seem identical in any one respect, so completely did he suppress those proofs of mental flexibility—not to say gullibility—on his part, which rendered it so easy a matter for the cunning outlaw to VOL. II. 27 persuade him that the moon was a green cheese, and he the best man to cut it. As he told the tale, it seemed to his hearers, that he had traced the outlaws to their haunts designedly—that he had cheated the dull dogs into the belief that he was a simple citizen, ambitious of no fortune more lofty than that of bringing the house down in applauses of his superior merits as an actor—beyond Kemble and Forrest, Kean and Cooper. How he had concealed his real purposes, and fathomed theirs; how he had traversed their haunts, traced their secrets, learned their signs and read all their mysteries, is a history to itself which might deserve its own volume. Yet, such was the fellow's ingenuity, he told no lie —no actual lie—and certainly meant none. His was one of those active and flexible imaginations that grow ductile at the slightest pressure and catch the slightest change of colour from the most casual cloud. His bricks soon became marble, and his fancy never went without its wings. On the present occasion it almost involved him in a worse difficulty than he had ever been in before. While he related his experience among the beagles, who should he encounter but his old acquaintance, Mr. Bull—Aristophanes Bull—whose headstrong opposition had already been a source of such infinite discomfiture to him; and who, if time had been given him, might very soon have corrected the little mistakes so naturally made in Horsey's narration. Fortunately, Bull had been at his usual potations, and our actor was no less prompt in action than in speech. When Bull struggled forward, with a skin full, thoroughly soaked, and only half conscious of the globe's motion, asking in hoarse tones, and with a hiccough: “What the hell's the matter here, boys?”—he received, in reply, a blow over the skull from Horsey's pistol in such downright good earnest, that it would have tasked the powers of all the Bull breed to have kept him well-balanced under it. Down he went, with a thump that fully assured the actor of his intention to await him there. This occurrence took place not twenty steps from the sleeping-place of Jones; and Horsey—little prudent as he was—began to entertain some misgivings that this cunning outlaw might be alarmed by the noise, and would give him trouble. A clump of shrub trees and one sturdy pine, stood between them and the victim; and here he commanded his men to pause until he should survey the ground alone. He advanced cautiously, keeping himself under cover of the shrubbery as he went forward, and soon had the satisfaction to find that all was quiet in the sylvan wigwam. He then motioned his fellows to advance; and two at the entrance, and three others conveniently stationed to yield assistance to the active assailants, entirely cut off the outlaw's hope of escape. Still he might give the alarm, and this it was important to prevent. Handkerchiefs were brought forward and got in readiness, while Horsey led the way and boldly penetrated the tent of poles and bushes under which the enemy slept. A stout fellow followed and seconded him, and the deep breathing of the outlaw guided them to the particular place of his repose. Still they could see nothing. They had to be guided entirely by the sense of feeling and the ear. At length, after much cautious management and some delay, they placed themselves on each side of his head. This ascertained, a whisper gave the signal, and while the stout companion of Horsey threw himself on the body, the latter adroitly passed a slipnoose around his neck, and awakened the sleeper to consciousness by a pressure of no moderate force. The arms and feet of their captive were meanwhile secured by the rest of their comrades, and the power of further harm was taken from him with a promptness and completeness, that would have been creditable to greater proficients. Still, with all their precautions, they could not altogether prevent his giving some alarm. With the readiness of a veteran, the outlaw at the first consciousness which he had of the danger, endeavoured to shout the signal of the band—a whoop, borrowed from the Indians, which, with better lungs, they had learned to endow with a somewhat more terrific energy—but the unrelenting fingers of Horsey were as prompt as the beagle's tongue, and the pressure of the ligature around the jugular, suddenly cut short the sounds before they had acquired sufficient vigour to pass beyond the gorge of his throat. A guard was set over him, with orders to shoot him at the first movement or show of rescue, while the rest of the captors proceeded in search of other foes. It will not need that we follow them. It may be necessary, however, to note one adventure of the party under Jamison. The worthy Alabamian was a second time fortunate in meeting with his quondam friend, the Irishman, Dennis O'Dougherty. His knee was upon the fellow's chest in the dark, when the brogue of the struggling prisoner declared who he was. “Ha! Dennis, my boy—is it you?” “By Jasus, honey, but you're a bit mistaken in the parson. I'm a very different jontleman, to your liking.” An effort to rise succeeded this speech, which the Alabamian effectually arrested by tickling the throat of his prisoner with the point of his bowie. “Be asy now, will you?—and don't be afther giving yourself any more throuble. Don't you think I understand plain spaking, my honey?” “You're no fool, Dennis,” said the Alabamian, as he found the Irishman lying quiet. “Had you twisted the littlest inch of your animal, Dennis, after the hint I gave you, I'd ha' been through you with more steel than Dick Smith ever swallowed. I will but run a ploughline under your arms, Dennis, to keep you comfortable, and you may thank me that I don't put it about your gullet. Is it easy to your elbows, Dennis?” “Asy! Jasus, Mr. Jamison, are you a jontleman?” “Well, any thing to make you comfortable; and so I'll let out a little; but, look you, Dennis, be quiet. I'm going from you a bit, and if you're not quiet, the man that watches you won't leave the skin to your teeth. He's a raal Ingin at sculping, and your head will be at his skirts, while your tongue's chattering about it.” But the smaller villains are not our object, and it will suffice to say, that it was not a difficult task, so complete had been the surprise, to capture nearly all the inmates of the swamp. The number at Cane Castle was usually small—the great body of the fraternity, as detailed in our former work, being engaged in active operations while traversing the country. Vernon knew that every thing depended on the capture or death of the chief—the masterspirit who had conceived a plan of operations so extensive, so bold, so well detailed, and so sternly carried out. To this labour, as we have seen, he devoted himself. A livelier interest served to stimulate his zeal, and to make him no less anxious and eager than resolute for the conflict. He knew that if he found Saxon awake, the struggle that would 27* probably ensue must be mortal. For this issue his energies of mind and body were braced to the utmost, and the image of Virginia Maitland, in the power of the ruffian and suffering from his violence, gave a terrible earnestness to his deportment, from the first moment when he embarked upon the adventure. He did find the outlaw awake, and under circumstances to keep alive the indignation and resolution of his heart. Conducted by the dwarf, Stillyards, to the wigwam, known among the beagles as the squatter's cabin at Little Bend, he beheld at a single glance, the object of his affections and the object of his hate. Virginia Maitland was before him, and before her was Saxon. The circumstances under which they stood, made the blood boil within the veins of the inflamed beholder, and he found it difficult so to restrain his passion, as to look around him with deliberation, and determine calmly what course to pursue. The house in which they were was a common fabric of logs such as is universal in the new countries of the southwest. It stood upon pine blocks, about four feet from the ground. It consisted of two rooms, separated from each other by a thin partition, the door of which opened in the centre. Each room had an entrance from without, independent of the other, and a single window in each sufficed to give it light. On the present occasion the doors and windows were closed, and the observation of Vernon was made through crevices between the logs of the building, of which the number was sufficient for all the purposes of espionage. Conducted by the dwarf, Stillyards, to one of these crevices, which the urchin seemed to find very readily, the objects that met the eyes of Vernon increased his emotions. Virginia Maitland was seated on a rude chair, at the doorway between the two rooms, her back to the one, which happened to be the sleeping apartment, and her face to Saxon, who strode the room before her. Her hands were clasped and resting upon her knees. Her neck and head were bent forward, while her eyes, with a tearless anxiety, watched every movement of the outlaw, as keenly as one would watch the form of the panther crouching in the tree above him, and in the attitude to spring. It was evident that as yet no outrage, other than that of her abduction, had been attempted by the ruffian; but her looks amply testified her fears, while his as clearly manifested his desires. That the outlaw had been striving to persuade her to his purposes was evident enough, and that his persuasions only awakened her apprehensions, might be inferred from her attitude of mixed prayer, watchfulness, and terror. Such was the picture that first met the eye of Vernon. The words of Saxon, a moment after, that met his ears, confirmed all the first impressions which it made upon his mind; and he placed the muzzle of his pistol, which was already cocked and in his hand, at the opening, which was sufficiently large to admit of his certain aim at the ruffian. But his cheek glowed a moment after with a feeling akin to shame. Vernon was not familiar with the shedding of blood, and no man who is not—unless he be equally cowardly and malignant—can possibly take life, except in the whirl and excitement of actual conflict. He felt that there was something base, from his concealment, to shoot down the unconscious man, however deserving he might be of his doom. To fling down from its erect place and posture an image so noble, made after the form of God, and filled with such godlike attributes and endowments, is, at best, and under its most justifiable circumstances, a melancholy performance; and with something of a romantic resolution, such as makes the wisest of men rash at seasons, he determined upon the bolder and more generous measure of giving the outlaw the benefit of an equal struggle. Such a prize as Virginia Maitland, seemed to justify every hazard, and Vernon resolved upon the very last. He rose from his recumbent position, and was about to proceed towards the doorway, when he felt a hand laid lightly upon his shoulder. Stillyards, meanwhile, had disappeared. He turned at the interruption— fancying another enemy at his elbow—and met the eyes of a woman—one so youthful and so beautiful as to strike him with wonder at seeing her in so wild a place. She met his gaze seemingly without emotion. There was a calm solemnity in her aspect, seen by the serious starlight, which riveted his attention, commanded his respect, and would have subdued, even in a far less reverent mind than his, any ribald thoughts or suspicions. “Stay!—But a single instant,” she whispered, and her uplifted finger gave him like warning. Before he could answer her, or imagine the object of her intrusion, she was gone from sight—literally vanished behind an angle of the building. But her warning was forgotten with her disappearance. Vernon was too much aroused for unnecessary delay, particularly too, as he saw not the reason of the woman's injunctions; and, just then, the pleading tones of Virginia's voice reached his ears in supplication and alarm. Breathless, he darted upon the steps of massive pine that led to the door of the building, and with a single blow of his heel, sent it from its hinges. Another moment found him within the apartment, and face to face with the outlaw. The proceeding was the work of an instant, but it found the outlaw prepared. He seized his pistols, which lay on a table near him, and instantly presented them. Vernon had not seen them before; and had he but waited, as he had been counselled by Florence Marbois, this danger would have been spared him. In the same moment when Saxon grasped the weapons, the hand of Florence was stretched out from the inner apartment to which she had penetrated with noiseless footsteps, for the purpose of securing them. But, though Saxon grasped and cocked the pistols at his enemy, he did not dare to use them. With the first appearance of Vernon, Virginia had started to her feet, and at the sight of his danger, she rushed between the parties, alternately turning an imploring face and an uplifted hand to each. She no longer exhibited the passive attitude of fear. All apprehension for herself departed when she feared for her lover; and that living grace of form and movement, which speaks out when the mother-mood prevails, riveted, at the same moment, with a sense of equal admiration, the souls of Vernon and the outlaw. And there, on each side of her the hostile parties stood—she, the angel between them, preventing strife, if not securing peace. Her words, wild, incoherent, impetuous, addressed the one and then the other; but failed of much effect upon either. Her position alone controlled the warfare which her presence was yet calculated to inspire. Suddenly, the arms of Saxon were grasped by Florence from behind; a deep imprecation burst from the outlaw's lips as he distinguished her. Vainly did he strive to shake her off; and the moment lost in this effort enabled Vernon to grapple with him at advantage. While they struggled, the dwarf, Stillyards, dropped upon the shoulders of the outlaw from the scantling above; and before he could be shaken off or removed, he had thrust his nails, which had been suffered to grow to an inordinate length, entirely through the ears of his late leader. This was one of the forms of retribution which consoled him for the similar indignity to which Saxon had subjected himself. By this time the house was filled; and the outlaw chief, who had struggled manfully while any hope remained to him, now yielded quietly to numbers. “This, then, is your work, Florence!” he murmured, as the woman he had wronged, confronted him. “Ay! mine! I glory in it—I rejoice too that you feel it to be mine. You could scorn my love!—perhaps, that was not so great an error as to scorn my power. It glads me to the soul to think that you can feel it and acknowledge it at last.” “If that will give you pleasure, Florence, be happy. If it can atone for the wrongs which I have done you, to know that you have compassed my doom, you have ample vengeance. I owe my death to your hands.” “Your death atone, Edward Saxon, for my misery!—for the wrong done to my honour—to my hope—to my pride—to my affections—to all things, and thoughts, and feelings which are dear to woman—which ennoble her to herself and endear her to society. Monstrous vanity! Your death, Edward Saxon, were you thrice to die, could never atone for the wrongs you have inflicted on the frail, fond, foolish heart of Florence Marbois. You have taken from her all that made life precious—and the life which seems so desirable to you, is her scorn. Look, and see what is her value of life, Edward Saxon; and, if you be not utterly base, you will yet learn from her example how to baffle the hangman. She to whom you ascribe your fate, will show you how completely indifferent you have made her to her own.” She advanced closely as she spoke to her betrayer. Her majestic form seemed to tower far above its usual height; and no language could describe the bitter scorn which looked from all her features, as she mocked him with that love of life which she professed to feel no longer. While yet the last words trembled on her lips, she drove a dagger, which till then was concealed within her garments, deep down into her breast. The deed was done before eye could see or hand interpose to prevent it. She was caught, while falling, by Vernon. Her last words, clear and emphatic, though broken, were addressed to the outlaw— “Live, Edward Saxon—if life be so precious to you—live! It has nothing precious now for me. To you I owe it, at least, that death is also without pain. Live!—live!” Her eyes followed him even in death. He strove, but vainly, to avert his own. He could not—he dared not. She had conquered, and the spell of her power was upon him in her dying moments. Unconsciously, the long breath escaped from him like a convulsive groan, when the thick glaze passing over her eyes, rescued him from the fascinating intensity of their glance. Thick drops stood upon his brow, as if he underwent a fearful agony; and his limbs tottered like one feeble with a long sickness, as they led him from the apartment under guard.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XXIII. “Last scene of all, That ends this strange, eventful history.” Shakespeare. Vernon bore Virginia Maitland, swooning, from this terrible scene, the actual performance of which had occupied far less time than our description of it. It had passed before the maiden's eyes, more like some dreadful phantasmagoria of the magician, than an event of actual life. He bore her into the fresh air, which partly revived her; and, under the direction and with the assistance of Horsey—who affected a better knowledge of Cane Castle than he really had,—succeeded in finding and conveying her to the little cottage, the mistress of which had put so fearful a finish to a life of feverish pain and most unhappy excitement. The last sacrifice was paid to the lingering sentiment of that love which still survived jealousy and anger, and which nothing but death could utterly extinguish. She had obtained the vengeance which she sought; and the thirst for which, in the first moment of her misery, had overborne the more native feeling of her heart. That done, the original passion resumed some portion of its activity, but only to make her feel still more acutely the undesirable and worthless character of all that remained to life; and the resolution to end it—taken at a moment when her vengeance was yet doubtful, seemed more than ever proper to her abased and erring spirit, when its claims were all satisfied. Is it sinful to hope that her crime was softened by her sufferings? There was so much that was bright and noble in her soul amidst all its smoke and impurities, that humanity may well be suffered to presume upon the indulgence of mercy, in behalf of one, in whose soul, amidst all the cloud, the smoke, and the impurity, there was so much that was really noble in sentiment, and bright and beautiful in thought. Florence Marbois, under other auspices, had been one of those lovely lights of society, that guide the hearts which they warm, and hallow the affections which they inspire and requite. Pass we to the living, no less lovely, and purer woman—to the fair Virginia, who, in the arms of Vernon, was soon restored, not less to the consciousness of life, than of those dear emotions that sanctify and sometimes make it heaven! If the past scene of terror, and strife, and death, through which she had been hurried, was not forgotten, its sting at least was taken away by the conviction that all who were dear to her had gone through it in safety, and that all danger to herself and others was past. She could now breathe in unrestraint, and yield herself for a space to that freedom of soul which delights in making its acknowledgments to the beloved one. If ever maiden were justified in speaking freely her happiness to her lover, it is she who has just been rescued by his gallantry from the most evil forms of danger. Virginia in the hour of her deliverance had no reserve. She hung upon the bosom of Vernon, happy in the weakness, which, while it made his valour dear to her, furnished VOL. II. 28 her with the best apology to cling to his embrace. A moment was given to these raptures—a brief moment; and the lover was recalled by one of his subordinates to a recollection of his farther duties. The night was fleeting fast, and it was the counsel of Rawlins, Jamison, and such other of his men as had a claim to advise in the proceedings, that they should instantly cross the river, and with their prisoners retrace their steps towards Zion's Hill. But Vernon thought otherwise. He knew the difficulty of travelling by night through unaccustomed swamps along with a daring set of men, who, though bound, might yet prove troublesome; and who, indeed, might readily find succour from passing bands of their companions. There was yet another reason which led Vernon to defer the movement of his party until morning. “Doubtless,” he said, “there are individuals of this gang going from and coming into the swamp at all hours of the night. By preserving the utmost silence where we are, placing a guard in each of their places of watch, and answering after their own fashion, any signals that we may hear from without, we shall be able to gather into our fold a few more of these scoundrels. I would not like to do the work by halves; still less am I willing to risk what has been gained by any precipitation of movement to-night. Our task now is easy; we have only to secure thoroughly the prisoners.” “That is already done,” said Rawlins, interrupting him. “Then our work is easy. It lacks but three hours to the dawn. We must keep our eyes open for that space of time and our weapons ready, and with the first gleam of light we can safely cross the river with all our captives. To move now would be to risk their loss, and perhaps our own. It is no easy matter to keep track in a strange region, and at night, with prisoners whom we may have to drive before us, and who might drop us in the darkness without greatly suffering from our pistols. Have the horses come? have you heard the signal from the other bank?” “They are there. Pollard crossed over to them by my order a bit ago,” was the reply. “It is well! Every thing favours us, men. We have lost no life, but little blood, and have so far succeeded in all our objects. Let us lose nothing by rashness. Coolness now and carefulness can alone secure our conquests. To you, Rawlins, as you know the swamp best of all of us, I must assign the task of placing guards over the best positions— and—hark! do you hear nothing? That surely was a signal.” “A beagle, by the powers! Here's fish for our net!” exclaimed Rawlins, as he started from the thicket where this conference had taken place. Jamison was about to follow, as also Horsey, but Vernon arrested them. “Rawlins is enough, and you might confuse him. He is equal to any robber of the gang, and will do the business more effectually if let alone. Hark! already he answers. His bay is quite as good as any of the beagles.” Vernon's judgment was correct. The sturdy woodman hurried in the direction of the sound, which still continued to reach his ears at intervals, becoming more and more clear and distinct as the party drew nigh. He stationed himself under cover at a point where he had surprised one of the robbers, and responding to the signal as he did so, coolly awaited the approach of the intruder. As the latter emerged on horseback from the woods above, he addressed the counterfeit presentment with all the familiarity of an old acquaintance. “Ha! that you Baker, or Chambers, which?” Rawlins grunted forth a sound which might pass for an affirmative. He feared to trust his own voice till he had the robber in his power; and it was fortunate that the latter had too much himself to say to regret the taciturnity of his companion. As he spoke, a chill went through the bones of Rawlins. A few sentences soon assured him that it was Gideon Badger who addressed him. That profligate son of a man whose purism assured him with a chuckle, that he was not like the miserable Pharisees around him, having demanded of the sentinel to lead him to the place where the chief of the outlaws slept, proceeded to develope his great discoveries to his companion, in anticipation of that revelation which he proposed to make to Saxon, and with which, with all the mean spirit of an inferior's servility, he calculated to commend himself to new favour in his sight. Rawlins could only make his responses in a groan. “What do you groan for, Baker?” demanded the other. “There's no danger now that we know all about it. We've time enough to scud and run to-night, and to-morrow we can turn upon that bullhead Rawlins, and dog his heels back to Zion's Hill. Nay, with a little increase of force we should be able to lather him at his own weapons and at any weapons. For my part, I'd rather it should be so. Nothing would give me half so much pleasure as to try the chance of a little scuffle with that fellow. If I didn't—” “Gideon Badger,” said Rawlins, in his natural tone of voice, “you have your wish. I am Wat Rawlins, and we're face to face. Now, show your manhood—all your manhood, Gideon—for you fight, let me tell you, for something more than Rachel Morrison—you fight for life! You fight with a rope round your neck.” “Wat Rawlins!” gasped the confounded youth, as he heard the words and recognised the voice of one whom in his secret soul he feared—“can it be!” “Are you ready?” demanded the woodman. “Be quick, Gideon;—I know I'm not doing right when I give you this chance for your life; but I want to save your old father from the shame of having son of his hung up by the neck. If I kill you, which will be all the better for you, I'll keep the secret, and bury you in the swamp with my own hands, so that nobody shall over know that we met you here to-night. Come!” “I will not fight with you,” was the hoarse but tremulous response of the youth. “I'm sorry for you, Gideon Badger,” said Rawlins, with an expression of pity in his accents, not unmingled with disgust. “I would have saved you from something worse than death. I'm sorry you're not as brave as your father. I can do no more. You must go with me—you're my prisoner.” He grasped the imbecile around his body as he spoke, with a grasp that would have defied his utmost powers. But these the unhappy youth did not offer to exercise. His heart seemed to have turned to water with the first conviction of his mind that Walter Rawlins really stood before him. His nerves failed him. His muscles shrunk and seemed to wither. Rawlins carried him into the presence of Vernon and the rest with as little trouble as if he had been an infant. The victors, having secured their new captive, had no farther interruption in the swamp that night. With the first glimmering of dawn, Vernon made his preparations for crossing the river to the place 28* where the horses of the party had been carried. This was a task more tedious than difficult. Some of the men were compelled to swim the river with a rope which had been previously fastened to the flat, and which was absolutely necessary in conveying across the river Virginia Maitland, Mrs. Yarbers—who had been an active coadjutor of the assailing party—the prisoners, and the inanimate form of Florence Marbois, which the gentler heart of Virginia would not suffer to be buried in the still and gloomy recesses of that swamp-forest in which she had dwelt so long. Rawlins ventured to promise that the cemetery at Zion's Hill should yield her a more consecrated place of repose. Her body, stretched out in the bottom of the boat, and completely enveloped in a cloak, was a subject of fearful interest to Saxon, who was compelled, from the smallness of the vessel and the number of its passengers, to remain unwillingly contiguous to it. More than once was he seen to shudder as he looked upon the unmeaning and almost shapeless outline, through the thick envelope of which, however, his keen-eyed and conscious spirit, beheld the reproachful expression of that face, and all those glances of love, and those features of beauty, which had once yielded him so much delight, and which his own capricious and unjust passions had obliterated and destroyed. His present situation, mostly to be ascribed to his own injustice to the one who most loved him, gave emphasis to those rebukes of conscience which now, for the first time, were acutely active in the contemplation of her corse. At this moment a persuasion of sentimental softness almost seized his mind,—he felt that love would have still preserved him, had he still been true to love. Unhappily for him and her, love and conscience equally spoke too late. A desperate resolution succeeded in his mind, and he turned his eyes upon the dark and turbid waters over which he was passing with an expression of anxious desire. Could he gain the side of the boat, a single plunge would baffle his captors, and defeat all the terrors of a public doom. His hands were bound, but his feet were free. He gave a single glance to the inanimate form of Florence, and made a movement to the opposite side of the flat. Already his foot touched the low gunwale, when the firm grasp of the watchful Vernon upon his shoulder, showed him that his object was discovered. He was led back into the centre of the boat, and surrounded by those who noted all his movements, with eyes too jealous to leave him any present hope of baffling their observation. Bitter, indeed, was the glance which he cast upon Vernon, as the latter withdrew his hand from the shoulder of the felon. “There was a time, Mr. Vernon, when you were less willing to approach me with so little scruple;— that, however, was when I was better able to approach you. Times change; and he who would have trembled to hear the lion's growl in the desert, takes him boldly by the mane when in the menagerie. Well! courage seems to depend very much upon the season. A bright or dark day makes a wonderful difference in the hearts of men. You are in season now, sir—much more so, I think, than when I met you at Lucchesa. Your hand is more ready now.” “It is my good fortune to improve then, sir,” replied Vernon, mildly and with a smile. “As for your notion of my courage, let that be as you choose. If you can really persuade yourself that it is not of the proper kind, and the persuasion pleases you, indulge it. My courage is of a sort that will remain perfectly unaffected, whatever course your opinion may take upon it. Another quality of it will be to take every precaution against the exercise of yours. In my custody you are safe enough. I would not forget myself, sir, by using the language of exultation over a prisoner, however small may be the forbearance which he merits at my hands.” “Oh, you are too indulgent!” was the almost fierce reply of the outlaw—“too indulgent! Would I could thank you as I could wish—as you deserve.” A moment after, and Saxon felt the feeble fury of his manner, and stopped suddenly, while a burning flush passed over his cheeks. Vernon turned away. They had now reached the opposite bank. An hour after this, and the cavalcade encountered a motley party of ten or a dozen men, headed by old William Badger himself. He was dressed up partially in some of the remnants of the ancient uniform which he wore when he followed Andrew Jackson down from Tennessee to his Indian battles in the southwest. The old and ragged cap which covered his grisly locks; the pistols in his holsters; the belt about his waist, and the long rifle in his grasp—were all the same; and here, it may be added, that, though he wore it not on this occasion, he yet, before sallying forth that morning, gave a long and curious examination to the ancient and motley blue wrapper, known in its day as a hunting-shirt—which had been too intimately associated in all the deeds and doings of his prime, to be discarded altogether even when the period of its usefulness was past. The ancient leader, however, made a far less ludicrous appearance than his men, with whom, in the sudden emergency that called them forth, motley seemed indeed to be “the only wear.” At another time, the appearance of this regiment would have moved Vernon and all his followers to unrestrained merriment; but there was a strong feeling in their hearts at this moment which effectually restrained all lighter moods. The thought that the venerable old man was marching forward to behold his own and only son, bound as an outlaw, and destined to all the penalties of such a life, filled them all with a sorrow that was not less deep because it was speechless. The very unconsciousness of the old man as he drew nigh—the rigid and pompous erectness of his carriage, and the swelling dignity of his manner—contributed to increase the solemnity of their feelings. Who should convey the truth to the father? It tasked the boldest heart and the best mind of the troop. Vernon rode forward as he approached, and giving instructions with Rawlins to keep his prisoners out of sight as long as possible, undertook the painful task of revealing the truth to the venerable elder. The task was rendered more difficult by the self-esteem of Badger. Assuming himself to have been ill-treated, overlooked, slighted, and in fact, thrust aside from the performance of his proper duties, by beardless boys, still in the gristle, inspired more by presumption than patriotism, he scarcely gave Vernon a civil recognition. But the latter, at such a time, and to one so much his elder, would have been ashamed to entertain any boyish resentments; and he bore patiently with the captiousness of the father, and by gradual degrees, brought him step by step to a consciousness of the gulf that was so suddenly to open before him. When the truth was fully shown—when the tale was fully told—there was no more visible emotion in the face of the hearer, beyond a slight quiver of the lips, than if he had listened to the most ordinary intelligence. His keen eyes, from under their gray shaggy brows, narrowly scanned the countenance of the speaker, and there, reading nothing but sincerity and distinctness, dropped quietly upon the ground. His lips opened but to exclaim: “Son of mine! son of mine! Oh, God! thou hast indeed stricken me with thy wrath. Verily, thou hast terribly rebuked the pride that was shooting upwards like a rank weed within my heart.” The exclamation denoted that self-esteem, still strong, still luxuriant, and still well cultivated in a favourite field, which was the predominant characteristic of his mind. That Gideon should be a bad fellow, was an unfortunate thing for Gideon; but it was something monstrous exceedingly, that Gideon, the son of William, should become so. “After this”—such was the still self-complaisant reflection of the elder—“who will believe in education?” The stern habits of the soldier, and the pride of the patriotic magistrate, came to the succour of the old man. “These wretched people must be committed for trial, Mr. Vernon, and though you have heretofore found yourself sufficient to do without my help, as a man, it is probable that you will require my assistance as a magistrate. Let them be brought before me, sir, as soon as you please, that I may examine them for commitment.” “All, sir?” said Vernon. “Ay, sir, all! God will sustain me, I trust, as he hath ever done, so that I shall be able to perform the trusts which have been confided to me, without fear or favour. I trust in his mercy, to have no feeling with one more than another of these unhappy wretches.” The reader need not ask to know, how such a man went through such a trial. William Badger's proceedings, on the present occasion, would have gained for him, in Roman ages, a column of enduring fame. Our story is nearly ended. That very day Horsey was made a special deputy, with two others, to arrest Mr. Justice Nawls; but the bird had flown. He had received from some secret quarter a warning of his danger, and had disappeared on a fleet horse an hour before the appearance of the party sent to arrest. The return to the magistrate was one which is said to have assumed the official dignity in some of the States—G. T. T.—which, rendered into the vernacular, signifies “Gone to Texas.” There is a report current at this time on the Big Black, that Nawls has become a great patriot in Texas, and has distinguished himself by several military achievements of no common order. He is not the first citizen who has lived a scoundrel and died a patriot. It was fortunate for the amateur that he did not take Mrs. Horsey with him to Texas, and make her a patriot too. Perhaps he would have done so, had time been allowed him. How many good deeds are defeated through a want of time. When the roving husband and his lovely wife returned to Zion's Hill, who should they encounter there but the venerable sire of the former, limping as much as ever, quite as rash and boisterous, and full of storms and cataracts, at the sight of the fugitive. He had come, in obedience to Vernon's letters, along with Ben Carter; and was confounded to meet a living son, where he thought it might be difficult to find even a dead one. His very joy—such was the force of habit—took the features, and indulged in the language of anger and abuse. “You ungrateful spendthrift—you—” He was silenced by a very summary proceeding. He little knew the sort of answer his son had in store for him. “Make you acquainted with Mrs. Tom Horsey, dad;” said he, with a swagger admirably theatrical, as he strutted full up to the old man, with the shrinking Mary hanging on his arm. “Mrs. Tom Horsey!—Why, Tom, it can't be possible. I expected to find you dead, and here you're only married. But are you married, Tom?” “Ay, dad, if the ceremony performed by such a rascal as Squire Nawls is worth a fig.” “Well, God bless you, Tom,—you're born to be an actor after all. And you, my gal,—who are you—what's your name? And—since you are Tom's wife, give's a smack. Another! another! Well, Tom, to a young man, marrying's not so bad after all. But where's Ben Carter?” This is a question which we may also ask. In another apartment, to themselves, Carter and his unfaithful friend Maitland communed for a lengthened hour. They came forth reconciled. Maitland frankly confessed his offences equally against friendship and good morals; and in making every atonement which had been left, he found Carter as he had ever found him, an indulgent benefactor. The relation in which Vernon stood to Virginia contributed greatly to this end. They also, to themselves, had their own explanations to make, and their several adventures to relate; the day promised fair, amid all the clouds that overcast the horizon at the beginning, to terminate in equal calm and brightness. To the three happy sets, whom we have conducted with persevering industry through the groves to the temple—from love to marriage—such, indeed, was its termination; but there was one storm that passed through the forest about this time which filled even their hearts with solemn shudderings, and for a long season after maintained a heavy weight upon their memories. Rawlins, who, with a select party, had the charge of the prisoners, returned at midnight, alone, to Zion's Hill, and brought with him a terrible narrative of outrage and bloodshed. The mob had risen upon his little party, and rescued the prisoners from his hands. But they did not rescue them to save. Goaded to madness by the long repeated crimes of the outlaws, they had resolved not to wait the tardy proceedings of justice; and in equal defiance of the entreaties and the efforts of the little guard, the unhappy criminals were dragged to death from their custody and protection. Another moment precipitated their doom. They were drawn up by the ropes which bound them, to the swinging branches over head, and hurried into eternity without a moment's grace—their prayers drowned— their convulsions mocked in the frantic joy, and the exulting shouts of the populace. The unlawfulness of their punishment, suggests the only occasion for sympathy in their behalf. They died on a spot which they themselves had deprived of all the securities of law, and had shadowed with every sort of crime. They perished by a reckless rage, for which a partial sanction may be found in the wantonness and brutality of their own deeds—in their unscrupulous robberies, their frequent cruelties, and most unfeeling murders. Saxon died as he had lived, a brave, fearless man. Perhaps, the compunctious writhings which troubled him at the death of Florence Marbois, had made him better prepared to die. In his death perished the spirit, the energy, and the capacity of the Border Beagles. He had made them what they were—resolute, compact,— one, and indivisible. Scattered at his death, they lost the faculties which had made them powerful, and have generally given up the more daring profession, for others of a like, but less dangerous character. Some, like Nawls, have gone to Texas, filled with a sudden desire of becoming patriots— others have taken to shaving, speculating, and banking; and a few, it is reported, have formed a new confederacy which bears the innocent, if not unmeaning title of “The Hypothecators.” What is the particular occupation which, under this head, they intend pursuing, is only conjectural. The more knowing seem to think that their purpose is nothing worse than the invention of fancy stocks; the designs of which they will dispose of to the numberless associations of Humbug, which cover this scheming nation as with an eighth plague. The locusts of the Egyptian never diminished his crops with half the success with which our locusts, the progeny of that fruitful Scotchman, John Law, have devastated the fields of Mississippi. The Border Beagles were nothing to them as public enemies. THE END.</field>
