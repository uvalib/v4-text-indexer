      <field name="fulltext">Captain John Farrago, AND TEAGUE OREGAN, HIS SERVANT. VOLUME I. By H. H. BRACKENRIDGE.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A INTRODUCTION. IT has been a question for some time past, what would be the best means to fix the English language. Some have thought of Dictionaries, others of Institutes, for that purpose. Swift, I think it was, who proposed, in his letters to the Earl of Oxford, the forming an academy of learned men, in order by their observations and rules, to settle the true spelling, accentuation, and pronunciation, as well as the proper words, and the purest, most simple, and perfect phraseology of language. It has always appeared to me, that if some great master of stile should arise, and without regarding sentiment, or subject, give an example of good language in his composition, which might serve as a model to future speakers and writers, it would do more to fix the orthography, choice of words, idiom of phrase, and structure of sentence, than all the Dictionaries and Institutes that have been ever made. For certainly, it is much more conducive to this end, to place before the eyes what is good writing, than to suggest it to the ear, which may forget in a short time all that has been said. It is for this reason, that I have undertaken this work; and that it may attain the end the more perfectly, I shall consider language only, not in the least regarding the matter of the work; but as musicians, when they are about to give the most excellent melody, pay no attention to the words that are set to music; but take the most unmeaning phrases, such as sol, fa, la; so here, culing out the choicest slowers of diction, I shall pay no regard to the idea; for it is not in the power of human ingenuity to attain two things perfectly at once. Thus we see that they mistake greatly, who think to have a clock that can at once tell the hour of the day, the age of the moon, and the day of the week, month, or year; because the complexness of the machine hinders that perfection which the simplicity of the works and movements can alone give. For it is not in nature to have all things in one. If you are about to chuse a wife, and expect beauty, you must give up family and fortune; or if you attain these, you must at least want good temper, health, or some other advantage: so to expect good language and good sense, at the same time, is absurd, and not in in the compass of common nature to produce. Attempting only one thing, therefore, we may entertain the idea of hitting the point of perfection. It has been owing to an inattention to this principle, that so many fail in their attempts at good writing. A Jack of all Trades, is proverbial of a bungler; and we scarcely ever find any one who excels in two parts of the same art; much less in two arts at the same time. The smooth poet wants strength; and the orator of a good voice, is destitute of logical reason and argument. How many have I heard speak, who, were they to attempt voice only, might be respectable; but undertaking, at the same time, to carry sense along with them, they utterly fail, and become contemptible. One thing at once, is the best maxim that ever came into the mind of man. This might be illustrated by a thousand examples; but I shall not trouble myself with any; as it is not so much my object to convince others as to shew the motives by which I myself am governed. Indeed, I could give authority which is superior to all examples; viz. that of the poet Horace; who, speaking on this very subject of excellence in writing, says, Quidvis, that is, whatever you compose, let it be, simplex duntaxit &amp; unum: that is, simple, and one thing only. It will be needless for me to say any thing about the critics; for as this work is intended as a model or rule of good writing, it cannot be the subject of criticism. It is true, Homer has been criticised by a Zoilus and an Aristotle; but the one contented himself with pointing out defects; the other, beauties. But Zoilus has been censured, Aristotle praised; because in a model there can be no defect; error consisting in a deviation from the truth, and faults, in an aberration from the original of beauty; so that where there are no faults there can be no food for A 2 criticism, taken in the unfavourable sense of finding fault with the productions of an author. I have no objections, therefore, to any praise that may be given to this work; but to censure or blame must appear absurd; because it cannot be doubted but that it will perfectly answer the end proposed. Being a book without thought, or the smallest degree of sense, it will be useful to young minds, not fatiguing their understandings, and easily introducing a love of reading and study. Acquiring language at first by this means, they will afterwards gain knowledge. It will be useful especially to young men of light minds intended for the bar or pulpit. By heaping too much upon them, stile and matter at once, you surfeit the stomach, and turn away the appetite from literary entertainment, to horse-racing and cock-fighting. I shall consider myself, therefore, as having performed an acceptable service to all weak and visionary people, if I can give them something to read without the trouble of thinking. But these are collataral advantages of my work, the great object of which is, as I have said before, to give a model of perfect stile in writing. If hereafter any author of supereminent abilities, should chuse to give this stile a body, and make it the covering to some work of sense, as you would wrap fine silk round a beautiful form, so that there may be, not only vestment, but life in the object, I have no objections; but shall be rather satisfied with having it put to so good a use.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAP. I. JOHN FARRAGO, was a man of about fifty-three years of age, of good natural sense, and considerable reading; but in some things whimsical, owing perhaps to his greater knowledge of books than of the world; but, in some degree, also, to his having never married, being what they call an old batchelor, a characteristic of which is, usually, singularity and whim. He had the advantage of having had in early life, an academic education; but having never applied himself to any of the learned professions, he had lived the greater part of his life on a small farm, which he cultivated with servants or hired hands, as he could conveniently supply himself with either. The servant that he had at this time, was an Irishman, whose name was Teague Oregan. I shall say nothing of the character of this man, because the very name imports what he was. A strange idea came into the head of Captain Farrago about this time; for, by the bye, I had forgot to mention that having being chosen captain of a company of militia in the neighbourhood, he had gone by the name of Captain ever since; for the rule is, once a captain, and always a captain; but, as I was observing, the idea had come into his head, to saddle an old horse that he had, and ride about the world a little, with his man Teague at his heels, to see how things were going on here and there, and to observe human nature. For it is a mistake to suppose, that a man cannot learn man by reading him in a corner, as well as on the widest space of transaction. At any rate, it may yield amusement. It was about a score of miles from his own house, that he fell in with what we call Races. The jockeys seeing him advance, with Teague by his side, whom they took for his groom, conceived him to be some person who had brought his horse to enter for the purse. Coming up and accosting him, said they, You seem to be for the races, Sir; and have a horse to enter. Not at all, said the captain; this is but a common palfrey, and by no means remarkable for speed or bottom; he is a common plough horse which I have used on my farm for several years, and can scarce go beyond a trot; much less match himself with your blooded horses that are going to take the field on this occasion. The jockeys were of opinion, from the speech, that the horse was what they call a bite, and that under the appearance of leanness and stiffness, there was concealed some hidden quality of swiftness uncommon. For they had heard of instances, where the most knowing had been taken in by mean looking horses; so that having laid two, or more, to one, they were nevertheless bit by the bet; and the mean looking nags, proved to be horses of a more than common speed and bottom. So that there is no trusting appearances. Such was the reasoning of the jockeys. For they could have no idea, that a man could come there in so singular a manner, with a groom at his foot, unless he had some great object of making money by the adventure. Under this idea, they began to interrogate him with respect to the blood and pedigree of his horse: whether he was of the dove, or the bay mare that took the purse; and was imported by such a one at such a time? whether his sire was Tamerlane or Bajazet? The Captain was irritated at the questions, and could not avoid answering.— Gentlemen, said he, it is a strange thing that you should suppose that it is of any consequence what may be the pedigree of a horse. For even in men it is of no avail. Do we not find that sages have had blockheads for their sons; and that blockheads have had sages? It is remarkable, that as estates have seldom lasted three generations, so understanding and ability have seldom been transmitted to the second. There never was a greater man, take him as an orator and philosopher, than Cicero: and never was there a person who had greater opportunities than his son Marcus; and yet he proved of no account or reputation. This is an old instance, but there are a thousand others. Chesterfield and his son are mentioned. It is true, Philip and Alexander may be said to be exceptions: Philip of the strongest possible mind; capable of almost every thing we can conceive; the deepest policy and the most determined valour; his son Alexander not deficient in the first, and before him in the last; if it is possible to be before a man than whom you can suppose nothing greater. It is possible, in modern times, that Tippo Saib may be equal to his father Hyder Ali. Some talk of the two Pitts. I have no idea that the son is, in any respect, equal to old Sir William. The one is a laboured artificial minister: the other spoke with the thunder, and acted with the lightning of the gods. I will venture to say, that when the present John Adamses, and Lees, and Jeffersons, and Jays, and Henrys, and other great men, who figure upon the stage at this time, have gone to sleep with their fathers, it is an hundred to one if there is any of their descendents who can fill their places. Was I to lay a bet for a great man, I would sooner pick up the brat of a tinker, than go into the great houses to chuse a piece of stuff for a man of genius. Even with respect to personal appearance, which is more in the power of natural production, we do not see that beauty always produces beauty; but on the contrary, the homliest persons have oftentimes the best favoured offspring; so that there is no rule or reason in these things. With respect to this horse, therefore, it can be of no moment whether he is blooded or studed, or what he is. He is a good old horse, used to the plough, and carries my weight very well; and I have never yet made enquiry with respect to his ancestors, or affronted him so much as to cast up to him the defect of parentage. I bought him some years ago from Niel Thomas, who had him from a colt. As far as I can understand, he was of a brown mare that John M`Neis had; but of what horse I know no more than the horse himself. His gaits are good enough, as to riding a short journey of seven or eight miles, or the like; but he is rather a pacer than a troter; and though his bottom may be good enough in carrying a bag to the mill, or going in the plough, or the sled, or the harrow, &amp;c. yet his wind is not so good, nor his speed, as to be fit for the heats. The jockeys thought the man a fool, and gave themselves no more trouble about him. The horses were now entered, and about to start for the purse. There was Black and all Black, and Snip, John Duncan's Barbary Slim, and several others. The riders had been weighed, and when mounted, the word was given. It is needless to describe a race; every body knows the circumstances of it. It is sufficient to say, that from the bets that were laid, there was much anxiety, and some passion in B the minds of those concerned: So, that as two of the horses, Black and all Black, and Slim, came out near together; there was dispute and confusion. It came to kicking and cuffing in some places. The Captain was a good deal hurt with such indecency amongst gentlemen, and advancing, addressed them in the following manner: Gentleman, this is an unequal and unfair proceeding. It is unbecoming modern manners, or even the ancient. For at the Olympic games of Greece, where were celebrated horse and chariot races, there was no such hurry scurry as this; and in times of chivalry itself, where men ate, drank, and slept on horse-back, though there was a great deal of pell-meling, yet no such disorderly work as this. If men had a difference, they couched their lances, and ran full tilt at one another; but no such indecent expressions, as villain, scoundrel, liar, ever came out of their mouths. There was the most perfect courtesy in those days of heroism and honour; and this your horse-racing, which is a germ of the amusement of those times, ought to be conducted on the same principles of decorum, and good breeding. As he was speaking, he was jostled by some one in the croud, and thrown from his horse; and had it not been for Teague, who was at hand, and helped him on again, he would have suffered damage. As it was, he received a contusion in his head, of which he complained much; and having left the race-ground, and coming to a small cottage, he stopped a little, to alight and dress the wound. An old woman who was there, thought they ought to take a little of his water, and see how it was with him; but the Captain having no faith in telling disorders by the urine, thought proper to send for a surgeon who was hard by, to examine the bruise, and apply bandages. The surgeon attended, and examining the part, pronounced it a contusion of the cerebrum. But as there appeared but little laceration, and no fracture, simple or compound, the pia mater could not be injured; nor even could there be more than a slight impression on the dura mater. So that trepaning did not at all appear necessary. A most fortunate circumstance; for a wound in the head, is of all places the most dangerous; because there can be no amputation to save life. There being but one head to a man, and that being the residence of the five senses, it is impossible to live without it. Nevertheless, as the present case was highly dangerous, as it might lead to a subsultus tendinum, or lock-jaw, it was necessary to apply cataplasms, in order to reduce inflammation, and bring about a sanative disposition of the parts. Perhaps it might not be amiss, to take an anodyne as a refrigerant. Many patients had been lost by the ignorance of empirics prescribing bracers; whereas, in the first stage of a contusion, relaxing and antifebrile medicines are proper. A little phlebotomy was no doubt necessary, to prevent the bursting of the blood vessels. The Captain hearing so many hard words, and bad accounts of this case, was much alarmed. Nevertheless he did not think it could be absolutely so dangerous. For it seemed to him that he was not sick at heart, or under any mortal pain. The surgeon observed, that in this case he could not himself be a judge. For the very part was affected by which he was to judge, viz. the head; that it was no uncommon thing for men in the extremest cases to imagine themselves out of danger; whereas in reality, they were in the greatest possible: that notwithstanding the symptoms were mild, yet from the contusion, a mortification might ensue. Hypocrates, who might be stiled an elementary physician, and has a treatise on this very subject, is of opinion, that the most dangerous symptom, is a topical insensibility; but among the moderns, Sydenham considers it in another point of view, and thinks that where there is no pain, there is as great reason to suppose that there is no hurt, as that there is a mortal one. Be this as it may, antiseptic medicines might be very proper. The Captain hearing so much jargon, and conscious to himself that he was by no means in so bad a state as this son of Escalapius would represent, broke out into some passion. It is, said he, the craft of your profession to make the case worse than it is, in order to increase the perquisites. But if there is any faith in you, make the same demand, and let me know your real judgment. The surgeon was irritated with his distrust, and took it into his head to fix some apprehension in the mind of his patient, if possible, that his case was not without danger. Looking stedfastly at him for some time, and feeling his pulse, there is, said he, an evident delirium approaching. This argues an affection of the brain, but it will be necessary, after some soporiferous draughts, to put the patient to sleep. Said the Captain, If you will give me about a pint of whiskey and water, I will try to go to sleep myself. Adeleterious mixture, in this case, said the surgeon, cannot be proper; especially a distillation of that quality. The Captain would hear no more; but requesting the man of the cabin, to let him have the spirits proposed, drank a pint or two of grog, and having bound up his head with a handkerchief, went to bed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAP. II. Containing some general Reflections. THE first reflection that arises, is, the good sense of the Captain; who was unwilling to impose his horse for a racer; not being qualified for the course. Because, as an old lean beast, attempting a trot he was respectable enough; but going out of his nature, and affecting speed, he would have been contemptible. The great secret of preserving respect, is the cultivating and shewing to the best advantage the powers that we possess, and the not going beyond them. Every thing in its element is good, and in their proper sphere all natures and capacities are excellent. This thought might be turned into a thousand different shapes, and cloathed with various expressions; but after all, it comes to the old proverb at last, Ne sutor ultra crepidam, Let the cobler stick to his last; a sentiment we are about more to illustrate in the sequel of this work. The second reflection that arises, is, the simplicity of the Captain; who was so unacquainted with the world, as to imagine that jockeys and men of the turf could be composed by reason and good sense; whereas there are no people who are by education of a less philosophic turn of mind. The company of horses is by no means favourable to good taste and genius. The rubbing and currying them, but little enlarges the faculties, or improves the mind; and even riding, by which a man is carried swiftly through the air, though it contributes to health, yet stores the mind with few or no ideas; and as men naturally consimilate with their company, so it is observable that your jockeys are a class of people not greatly removed from the sagacity of a good horse. Hence most probably the fable of the centaur, among the ancients; by which they held out the moral of the jockey and the horse being one beast. A third reflection is, that which he exprest; viz. the professional art of the surgeon to make the most of the case, and the technical terms used by him. I have to declare, that it is with no attempt at wit, that the terms are set down, or the art of the surgeon hinted at; because it is so common place a thing to ridicule the peculiarities of a profession, that it savours of mean parts to indulge it. For a man of real genius will never walk in the beaten track, because his object is what is new and uncommon. This surgeon does not appear to have been a man of very great ability; but the Captain was certainly wrong in declining his prescriptions; for the maxim is, Unicuique in arte, sua perito, credendum est; every one is to be trusted in his profession.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAP. III. THE Captain rising early next morning, and setting out on his way, had now arrived at a place where a number of people were convened, for the purpose of electing persons to represent them in the legislature of the state. There was a weaver who was a candidate for this appointment, and seemed to have a good deal of interest among the people. But another, who was a man of education, was his competitor. Relying on some talent of speaking which he thought he possessed, he addressed the multitude. Said he, Fellow citizens, I pretend not to any great abilities; but am conscious to myself that I have the best good will to serve you. But it is very astonishing to me, that this weaver should conceive himself qualified for the trust. For though my acquirements are not great, yet his are still less. The mechanical business which he pursues, must necessarily take up so much of his time, that he cannot apply himself to political studies. I should therefore think it would be more answerable to your dignity, and conducive to your interest, to be represented by a man at least of some letters, than by an illiterate handicraftsman like this. It will be more honourable for himself, to remain at his loom and knot threads, than to come forward in a legislative capacity: because, in the one case, he is in the sphere where God and nature has placed him; in the other, he is like a fish out of water, and must struggle for breath in a new element. Is it possible he can understand the affairs of government, whose mind has been concentered to the small object of weaving webs; to the price by the yard, the grist of the thread, and such like matters as concern a manufacturer of cloths? The feet of him who weaves, are more occupied than the head, or at least as much; and therefore the whole man must be, at least, but in half accustomed to exercise his mental powers. For these reasons, all other things set aside, the chance is in my favour, with respect to information. However, you will decide, and give your suffrages to him or to me, as you shall judge expedient. The Captain hearing these observations, and looking at the weaver, could not help advancing, and undertaking to subjoin something in support of what had been just said. Said he, I have no prejudice against a weaver more than another man. Nor do I know any harm in the trade; save that from the sedentary life in a damp place, there is usually a paleness of the countenance: but this is a physical, not a moral evil. Such usually occupy subterranean apartments; not for the purpose, like Demosthenes, of shaving their heads, and writing over eight times the history of Thucydides, and perfecting a stile of oratory; but rather to keep the thread moist; or because this is considered but as an inglorious sort of trade, and is frequently thrust away into cellars, and damp outhouses, which are not occupied for a better use. But to rise from the cellar to the senate house, would be an unnatural hoist. To come from counting threads, and adjusting them to the splits of a reed, to regulate the finances of a government, would be preposterous; there being no congruity in the case. There is no analogy between knotting threads and framing laws. It would be a reversion of the order of things. Not that a manufacturer of linen or woolen, or other stuff, is an inferior character, but a different one, from that which ought to be employed in affairs of state. It is unnecessary to enlarge on this subject; for you must all be convinced of the truth and propriety of what I say. But if you will give me leave to take the manufacturer aside a little, I think I can explain to him my ideas on the subject; and very probably prevail with him to withdraw his pretensions. The people seeming to acquiesce, and beckoning to the weaver, they drew aside, and the Captain addressed him in the following words: Mr. Traddle, said he, for that was the name of the manufacturer, I have not the smallest idea of wounding your sensibility; but it would seem to me, it would be more your interest to pursue your occupation, than to launch out into that of which you have no knowledge. When you go to the senate house, the application to you will not be to warp a web; but to make laws for the commonwealth. Now, suppose that the making these laws, requires a knowledge of commerce, or of the interests of agriculture, or those principles upon C which the different manufactures depend, what service could you render. It is possible you might think justly enough; but could you speak? You are not in the habit of public speaking. You are not furnished with those common place ideas, with which even very ignorant men can pass for knowing something. There is nothing makes a man so ridiculous as to attempt what is above his sphere. You are no tumbler for instance; yet should you give out that you could vault upon a man's back; or turn head over heels, like the wheel of a cart; the stiffness of your joints would encumber you; and you would fall upon your backside to the ground. Such a squash as that would do you damage. The getting up to ride on the state is an unsafe thing to those who are not accustomed to such horsemanship. It is a disagreeable thing for a man to be laughed at, and there is no way of keeping ones self from it but by avoiding all affectation. While they were thus discoursing, a bustle had taken place among the croud. Teague hearing so much about elections, and serving the government, took it into his head, that he could be a legislator himself. The thing was not displeasing to the people, who seemed to favour his pretensions; owing, in some degree, to there being several of his countrymen among the croud; but more especially to the fluctuation of the popular mind, and a disposition to what is new and ignoble. For though the weaver was not the most elevated object of choice, yet he was still preferable to this tatter-demalion, who was but a menial servant, and had so much of what is called the brogue on his tongue, as to fall far short of an elegant speaker. The Captain coming up, and finding what was on the carpet, was greatly chagrined at not having been able to give the multitude a better idea of the importance of a legislative trust; alarmed also, from an apprehension of the loss of his servant. Under these impressions he resumed his address to the multitude. Said he, This is making the matter still worse, gentlemen: this servant of mine is but a bog-trotter; who can scarcely speak the dialect in which your laws ought to be written; but certainly has never read a single treatise on any political subject; for the truth is, he cannot read at all. The young people of the lower class, in Ireland, have seldom the advantage of a good education; especially the descendants of the ancient Irish, who have most of them a great assurance of countenance, but little information, or literature. This young man, whose family name is Oregan, has been my servant for several years. And, except a too great fondness for women, which now and then brings him into scrapes, he has demeaned himself in a manner tolerable enough. But he is totally ignorant of the great principles of legislation; and more especially, the particular interests of the government. A free government is a noble possession to a people: and this freedom consists in an equal right to make laws, and to have the benefit of the laws when made. Though doubtless, in such a government, the lowest citizen may become chief magistrate; yet it is sufficient to possess the right; not absolutely necessary to exercise it. Or even if you should think proper, now and then, to shew your privilege, and exert, in a signal manner, the democratic prerogative, yet is it not descending too low to filch away from me a hireling, which I cannot well spare, to serve your purposes? You are surely carrying the matter too far, in thinking to make a senator of this hostler; to take him away from an employment to which he has been bred, and put him to another, to which he has served no apprenticeship: to set those hands which have been lately employed in currying my horse, to the draughting-bills, and preparing business for the house. The people were tenacious of their choice, and insisted on giving Teague their suffrages; and by the frown upon their brows, seemed to indicate resentment at what had been said; as indirectly charging them with want of judgment; or calling in question their privilege to do what they thought proper. It is a very strange thing, said one of them, who was a speaker for the rest, that after having conquered Burgoyne and Cornwallis, and got a government of our own, we cannot put in it whom we please. This young man may be your servant, or another man's servant; but if we chuse to make him a delegate, what is that to you. He may not be yet skilled in the matter, but there is a good day a-coming. We will impower him; and it is better to trust a plain man like him, than one of your C 2 high flyers, that will make laws to suit their own purposes. Said the Captain, I had much rather you would send the weaver, though I thought that improper, than to invade my household, and thus detract from me the very person that I have about me to brush my boots, and clean my spurs. The prolocutor of the people gave him to understand that his surmises were useless, for the people had determined on the choice, and Teague they would have for a representative. Finding it answered no end to expostulate with the multitude, he requested to speak a word with Teague by himself. Stepping aside, he said to him, composing his voice, and addressing him in a soft manner; Teague, you are quite wrong in this matter they have put into your head. Do you know what it is to be a member of a deliberative body? What qualifications are necessary? Do you understand any thing of geography? If a question should be, to make a law to dig a canal in some part of the state, can you describe the bearing of the mountains, and the course of the rivers? Or if commerce is to be pushed to some new quarter, by the force of regulations, are you competent to decide in such a case? There will be questions of law, and astronomy on the carpet. How you must gape and stare like a fool, when you come to be asked your opinion on these subjects? Are you acquainted with the abstract principles of finance; with the funding public securities; the ways and means of raising the revenue; providing for the discharge of the public debts, and all other things which respect the economy of the government? Even if you had knowledge, have you a facility of speaking. I would suppose you would have too much pride to go to the house just to say, Ay, or No. This is not the fault of your nature, but of your education; having been accustomed to dig turf in your early years, rather than instructing yourself in the classics, or common school books. When a man becomes a member of a public body, he is like a racoon, or other beast that climbs up the fork of a tree; the boys pushing at him with pitch-forks, or throwing stones, or shooting at him with an arrow, the dogs barking in the mean time. One will find fault with your not speaking; another with your speaking, if you speak at all. They will have you in the news papers, and ridicule you as a perfect beast. There is what they call the caricatura; that is, representing you with a dog's head, or a cat's claw. As you have a red head, they will very probably make a fox of you, or a sorrel horse, or a brindled cow, or the like. It is the devil in hell to be exposed to the squibs and crackers of the gazette wits and publications. You know no more about these matters than a goose; and yet you would undertake rashly, without advice, to enter on the office; nay, contrary to advice. For I would not for a thousand guineas, though I have not the half of it to spare, that the breed of the Oregans should come to this; bringing on them a worse stain than stealing sheep; to which they are addicted. You have nothing but your character, Teague, in a new country to depend upon. Let it never be said, that you quitted an honest livelihood, the taking care of my horse, to follow the new fangled whims of the times, and to be a statesman. Teague was moved chiefly with the last part of the address, and consented to give up the object. The Captain, glad of this, took him back to the people, and announced his disposition to decline the honour which they had intended him. Teague acknowledged that he had changed his mind, and was willing to remain in a private station. The people did not seem well pleased with the Captain; but as nothing more could be said about the matter, they turned their attention to the weaver, and gave him their suffrages.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAP. IV. CAPTAIN FARRAGO leaving this place, proceeded on his way; and at the distance of a mile or two, met a man with a bridle in his hand; who had lost a horse, and had been at a conjurer's to make enquiry, and recover his property. It struck the mind of the Captain to go to this conjuring person, and make a demand of him, what was the cause that the multitude were so disposed to elevate the low to the highest station. He had rode but about a mile, when the habitation of the conjurer, by the direction and description of the man who had lost the horse had given, began to be in view. Coming up to the door, and enquiring if that was not where conjurer Kolt lived, they were answered Yes. Accordingly alighting, and entering the domicile, all those things took place which usually happen, or are described in cases of this nature, viz. there was the conjurer's assistant, who gave the Captain to understand that master had withdrawn a little, but would be in shortly. In the mean time, the assistant endeavoured to draw from him some account of the occasion of his journey; which the other readily communicated; and the conjurer, who was listening through a crack in the partition, overheard. Finding it was not a horse or a cow, or a piece of linen that was lost, but an abstract question of political philosophy which was to be put, he came from his lurking place, and entered, as if not knowing that any person had been waiting for him. After mutual salutations, the Captain gave him to understand the object which he had in view by calling on him. Said the conjurer, This lies not at all in my way. If it had been a dozen of spoons, or a stolen watch, that you had to look for, I could very readily, by the assistance of my art, have assisted you in the recovery; but as to this matter of men's imaginations and attachments in political affairs, I have no more understanding than another man. It is very strange, said the Captain, that you who can tell by what means a thing is stolen, and the place where it is deposited, though at a thousand miles distance, should know so little of what is going on in the breast of man, as not to be able to develope his secret thoughts, and the motives of his actions. It is not of our business, said the other; but should we undertake it, I do not see that it would be very difficult to explain all that puzzles you at present. There is no need of a conjurer to tell why it is that the common people are more disposed to trust one of their own class, than those who may affect to be superior. Besides, there is a certain pride in man, which leads him to elevate the low, and pull down the high. There is a kind of creating power exerted in making a senator of an unqualified person; which when the author has done, he exults over the work, and, like the Creator himself when he made the world, sees that “it is very good.” Moreover, there is in every government a patrician class, against whom the spirit of the multitude naturally militates: And hence a perpetual war; the aristocrats endeavouring to detrude the people, and the people contending to obtrude themselves. And it is right it should be so; for by this fermentation, the spirit of democracy is kept alive. The Captain, thanking him for his information, asked him what was to pay; at the same time pulling out half a crown from a green silk purse which he had in his breeches pocket. The conjurer gave him to understand, that as the solution of these difficulties was not within his province, he took nothing for it. The Captain expressing his sense of his disinterested service, bade him adieu.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">D CHAP. V. Containing Reflections. A Democracy is beyond all question the freest government: because under this, every man is equally protected by the laws, and has equally a voice in making them. But I do not say an equal voice; because some men have stronger lungs than others, and can express more forcibly their opinions of public affairs. Others, though they may not speak very loud, yet have a faculty of saying more in a short time; and even in the case of others, who speak little or none at all, yet what they do say containing good sense, comes with greater weight; so that all things considered, every citizen, has not, in this sense of the word, an equal voice. But the right being equal, what great harm if it is unequally exercised? is it necessary that every man should become a statesman? No more than that every man should become a poet or a painter. The sciences, are open to all; but let him only who has taste and genius pursue them. If any man covets the office of a bishop, says St. Paul, he covets a good work. But again, he adds this caution, Ordain not a novice, lest being lifted up with pride, he falls into the condemnation of the devil. It is indeed making a devil of a man to lift him up to a state to which he is not suited. A ditcher is a respectable character, with his over-alls on, and a spade in his hand; but put the same man to those offices which require the head, whereas he has been accustomed to impress with his foot, and there appears a contrast between the man and the occupation. There are individuals in society, who prefer honour to wealth; or cultivate political studies as a branch of literary pursuits; and offer themselves to serve public bodies, in order to have an opportunity of discovering their knowledge, and exercising their judgment. It must be chagrining to these, and hurtful to the public, to see those who have no talent this way, and ought to have no taste, preposterously obtrude themselves upon the government. It is the same as if a brick-layer should usurp the office of a taylor, and come with his square and perpendicular, to take the measure of a pair of breeches. It is proper that those who cultivate oratory, should go to the house of orators. But for an Ay and No man to be ambitious of that place, is to sacrifice his credit to his vanity. I would not mean to insinuate that legislators are to be selected from the more wealthy of the citizens, yet a man's circumstances ought to be such as afford him leisure for study and reflection. There is often wealth without taste or talent. I have no idea, that because a man lives in a great house, and has a cluster of bricks or stones about his backside, that he is therefore fit for a legislator. There is so much pride and arrogance with those who consider themselves the first in a government, that it deserves to be checked by the populace, and the evil most usually commences on this side. Men associate with their own persons, the adventitious circumstances of birth and fortune: So that a fellow blowing with fat and repletion, conceives himself superior to the poor lean man, that lodges in an inferior mansion. But as in all cases, so in this, there is a medium. Genius and virtue are independent of rank and fortune; and it is neither the opulent, nor the indigent, but the man of ability and integrity that ought to be called forth to serve his country: and while, on the one hand, the aristocratic part of the government, arrogates a right to represent; on the other hand, the democratic contends the point; and from this conjunction and opposition of forces, there is produced a compound resolution, which carries the object in an intermediate direction. When we see therefore, a Teague Oregan lifted up, the philosopher will reflect, that it is to balance some purse-proud fellow, equally as ignorant, that comes down from the sphere of the aristocratic interest. But every man ought to consider for himself, whether it is his use to be this draw-back, on either side. For as when good liquor is to be distilled, you throw in some material useless in itself to correct the effervescence of the spirit; so it may be his part to act as a sedative. For though we commend the effect, yet still the material retains but its original value. But as the nature of things is such, let no man, who means well to the commonwealth, and offers to serve it, be hurt in his mind when some one of meaner talents D 2 is preferred. The people are a sovereign, and greatly despotic; but, in the main, just. I have a great mind, in order to elevate the composition, to make quotations from the Greek and Roman history. And I am conscious to myself, that I have read over the writers on the government of Italy and Greece, in ancient, as well as modern times. But I have drawn a great deal more from reflection on the nature of things, than from all the writings I have ever read. Nay, the history of the election, which I have just given, will afford a better lesson to the American mind, than all that is to be found in other examples. We have seen here, a weaver a favoured candidate, and in the next instance, a bog-trotter superseding him. Now it may be said, that this is fiction; but fiction, or no fiction, the nature of the thing will make it a reality. But I return to the adventures of the Captain, whom I have upon my hands; and who, as far as I can yet discover, is a good honest man; and means what is benevolent and useful; though his ideas may not comport with the ordinary manner of thinking, in every particular.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">BOOK II. CHAP. I. THERE was, in a certain great city, a society who called themselves Philosophers. They had published books, they called Transactions. These contained dissertations on the nature and causes of things; from the stars of the heaven to the fire-flies of the earth; and from the sea-crab to the woodland buffaloe. Such disquisitions, are doubtless useful and entertaining to an inquisitive mind. There is no question, but there were in this body some very great men; whose investigations of the arcana of nature, deserve attention. But so it was, there had been introduced, by some means, many individuals, who were no philosophers at all. This is no unusual thing with institutions of this nature; though, by the bye, it is a very great fault. For it lessens the incentives of honour, to have the access made so easy, that every one may obtain admission. It has been a reproach to some colleges, that a diploma could be purchased for half a crown. This society were still more moderate; for the bare scratching the backside of a member has been known to procure a fellowship. At least, there have been those admitted who appeared capable of nothing else. Nevertheless, it was necessary, even in these cases, for the candidates to procure some token of a philosophical turn of mind; such as the skin of a dead cat, or some odd kind of a mouse-trap, or the like; or have some phrases in their mouths, about minerals and petrifactions; so as just to support some idea of natural knowledge, and pass muster. There was one who had got in by finding, accidentally, the tail of a rabbit, which had been taken off in a boy's trap. Another by means of a squirrel's scalp, which he had taken care to stretch and dry on a bit of osier, bended in the form of a hoop. The beard of an old fox, taken off and dried in the sun, was the means of introducing one whom I knew very well: Or rather, as I have already hinted, it was beforehand intended he should be introduced; and these exuviæ, or spoils of the animal kingdom, were but the tokens and apologies for admission. It happened, as the Captain was riding this day, and Teague trotting after him, he saw a large owl, that had been shot by some body, and was placed in the crotch of a tree, about the height of a man's head from the ground, for those that passed by to look at. The Captain being struck with it, as somewhat larger than such birds usually are, desired Teague to reach it to him; and tying it to the hinder part of his saddle, rode along. Passing by the house of one who belonged to the society, the bird was noticed at the saddle-skirts, and the philosopher coming out, made enquiry of the genus and nature of the fowl. Said the Captain, I know nothing more about it, than that it is nearly as long as a turkey buzzard. It is doubtless, said the other, the great Canada owl, that comes from the Lakes; and if your honour will give me leave, I will take it and submit it to the society, and have yourself made a member. As to the first, the Captain consented; but as to the last, the being a member, he chose rather to decline it; conceiving himself unqualified for a place in such a body. The other assured him that he was under a very great mistake; for there were persons there who scarcely knew a B from a bull's foot. That may be, said the Captain; but if others chuse to degrade themselves, by suffering their names to be used in so preposterous a way as that, it was no reason he should. The other gave him to understand, that the society would certainly wish to express their sense of his merit, and shew themselves not inattentive to a virtuoso; that as he declined the honour himself, he probably might not be averse to let his servant take a seat among them. Said the Captain, He is but a simple Irishman, and of a low education; his language being that spoken by the aborigines of his country. And if he speaks a little English, it is with the brogue on his tongue; which would be unbecoming in a member of your body. It would seem to me, that a philosopher ought to know how to write, or at least to read. But Teague can neither write nor read. He can sing a song, or whistle an Irish tune; but is totally illiterate in all things else. I question much if he could tell you how many new moons there are in the year; or any the most common thing that you could ask him. He is a long-legged fellow, it is true; and might be of service in clambering over rocks, or going to the shores of rivers, to gather curiosities. But could you not get persons to do this, without making them members? I have more respect for science, than to suffer this bog-trotter to be so advanced at its expence. In these American states, there is a wide field for philosophic search; and these researches may be of great use in agriculture, mechanics, and astronomy. There is but little immediate profit attending these pursuits; but if there can be inducements of honour, these may supply the place. What more alluring to a young man, than the prospect of being, one day, received into a society of men truly learned; the admission being a test and a proof of distinguished knowledge. But the fountain of honour, thus contaminated by a sediment foreign from its nature, who would wish to drink of it? Said the philosopher, At the first institution of the society by Dr. Franklin and others, it was put upon a narrow basis, and only men of science were considered proper to compose it; and this might be a necessary policy at that time, when the institution was in its infancy, and could not bear much draw-back of ignorance. But it has not been judged so necessary of late years. The matter stands now on a broad and catholic bottom; and, like the gospel itself, it is our orders to go out into the high-ways and hedges, and compel them to come in. There are hundreds, whose names you may see on our list, who are not more instructed than this lad of yours. They must be a sad set indeed then, said the Captain. Sad or no sad, said the other, it is the case; and if you will let Teague go, I will engage him a membership. I take it very ill of you, Mr. Philosopher, said the Captain, to put this nonsense in his head. If you knew what trouble I have lately had with a parcel of people that were for sending him to Congress, you would be unwilling to draw him from me for the purpose of making him a philosopher. It is not an easy matter to get hirelings now-a-days; and when you do get one, it is a mere chance, whether he is faithful, and will suit your purpose. It would be a very great loss to me, to have him taken off at this time, when I have equipped myself for a journey. Teague was a good deal incensed at this refusal of his master, and insisted that he would be a philosopher. You are an ignoramus, said the Captain. It is not the being among philosophers will make you one. Teague insisted that he had a right to make the best of his fortune: and as there was a door open to his advancement, he did not see why he might not make use of it. The Captain finding that it answered no end to dispute the matter with him, by words of sense and reason, took a contrary way to manage him. Teague, said he, I have a regard for you, and would wish to see you do well. But before you take this step, I would wish to speak a word or two in private. If you will go, I may perhaps suggest some things that may be of service to you, for your future conduct in that body. Teague consenting, they stepped aside; and the Captain addressed him in the following manner: E Teague, said he, do you know what you are about? It is a fine thing, at first sight, to be a philosopher, and get into this body. And indeed, if you are a real philosopher, it might be some honour, and also safe, to take that leap. But do you think it is to make a philosopher of you that they want you? Far from it. It is their great study to find curiosities; and because this man saw you coming after me, with a red head, trotting like an Esquimaux Indian, it has struck his mind to pick you up, and pass you for one. Nay, it is possible, they may intend worse; and when they have examined you awhile, take the skin off you, and pass you for an over-grown otter, or a musk-rat; or some outlandish animal, for which they will, themselves, invent a name. If you were at the museum of one of these societies, to observe the quantity of skins and skeletons they have, you might be well assured they did not come by them honestly. I know so much of these people, that I am well persuaded they would think no more of throwing you into a kettle of boiling water, than they would a tarapin; and having scraped you out to a shell, present you as the relics of an animal they had procured, at an immense price, from some Guinea merchant. Or if they should not at once turn you to this use, how, in the mean time, will they dispose of you? They will have you away through the bogs and marshes, catching flies and miresnipes; or send you to the woods for a polecat; or oblige you to descend into drawwells for fog, and phlogistic air, and the Lord knows what. You must go into wolves dens, and catch bears by the tail; run over mountains like an opossum, and dig the earth like a ground hog. You will have to climb upon trees, and get yourself bit by flying squirrels. There will be no end to the musketoes you will have to dissect. What is all this to diving into mill-dams and rivers, to get craw-fish. Or if you go to the ocean, there are alligators to devour you like a cat-fish. Who knows but it may come your turn, in a windy night, to go aloft to the heavens, to rub down the stars, and give the goats and rams, that are there, fodder. The keeping the stars clean, is a laborious work; a great deal worse than scouring andirons, or brass kettles. There is a bull there would think no more of tossing you on his horns than he would a puppy dog. If the crab should get you in his claws he would squeeze you like a lobster. But what is all that to your having no place to stand on? How would you like to be up at the moon, and to fall down when you had missed your hold, like a boy from the top-mast of a ship, and have your brains beat out upon the top of some great mountain; where the devil might take your skeleton and give it to the turkey-buzzards? Or if they should, in the mean time, excuse from such out of door services, they will rack and torture you with hard questions. You must tell them how long the rays of light are coming from the sun; how many drops of rain fall in a thunder gust; what makes the grasshopper chirp when the sun is hot; how muscle shells get up to the top of the mountains; how the Indians got over to America. You will have to prove absolutely that the negroes were once white; and that their flat noses came by some cause in the compass of human means to produce. These are puzzling questions; and yet you must solve them all. Take my advice, and stay where you are. Many men have ruined themselves by their ambition, and made bad worse. There is another kind of philosophy, which lies more within your sphere; that is moral philosophy. Every hostler or hireling can study this, and you have the most excellent opportunity of acquiring this knowledge in our traverses through the country; or communications at the different taverns or villages, where we may happen to sojourn. Teague had long ago given up all thoughts of philosophy, and would not for the world have any more to do with it; and therefore, without bidding the philosopher adieu, they pursued their route as usual. E 2 CHAP. II. Containing Observations. THE institution of the American Philosophical Society, does great honour to the founders; and what has been published by that body, comes not behind what has appeared from societies of the same nature elsewhere. But of late years, it has ceased to be presumptive evidence, at least what the lawyers call violent presumption, of philosophical attainments, to be a member; owing to the spurious brood of illiterate persons that have been admitted indiscriminately with the informed; this again, owing to a political dispute in the government where this society exists. For when there are parties in a commonwealth, they naturally subdivide themselves, and are found even in the retreats of the muses. It has become the question with this society, not whether a man is a philosopher or not, but what part he had taken in some question on the carpet. The body conceived itself to pay a compliment to the person admitted, as if it could be any honour to a man to be announced what he is not. The contrary is the case here. For as honour is the acknowledgement which the world makes of a man's respectability, there can be no honour here; for it has become a mere matter of moon-shine to be a member. To be or not be, that is the question; but so trifling, that it is scarcely ever made. The way to remedy this, would be to have an over hauling of the house, and derange at least three parts in four. As in the case of Tarquin, and the three remaining books of the Sybiles, you would receive as much for the fourth part of that body, should you set them up at market, as for the whole at present. I have often reflected with myself, what an honour it must be, to be one of the society of the French academy; forty, of twenty-four millions of people, are there selected in consequence of literary characters already established. I recollect the time when I had high ideas of philosophical membership in America. But it does not appear to me now to be the highest thing that a man could wish, since even a common Teague Oregan, trotting on the high way, has been solicited to take a seat. It may be said, that this is an exaggeration of the facts; and can be considered only as burlesque. I profess it is not intended as such, but as a fair picture of what has taken place. Should it be considered in the light of burlesque, it must be a very lame one; because where there is no excess there can be no caricatura. But omitting all apologies and explanations, let the matter rest where it is.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">BOOK III. CHAP. I. IT was somewhat late when the Captain arrived at an inn this evening. There was there before him, a young clergyman, who had been preaching that day in a neighbouring congregation; but had not as usual, gone home with an elder; but had come thus far on his way towards another place, where he was to preach the next day. The Captain entering into conversation with the clergyman, sat up pretty late. The subject was what might be expected; viz. the affairs of religion and the church. The clergyman was a good young man; but inclining to fanaticism, and being righteous over much: The Captain on the other hand, somewhat sceptical in his notions of religion: Hence, a considerable opposition of sentiment between the two. But at length, drowziness seizing both, candles were called for, and they went to bed. It was about an hour or two after, when an uproar was heard in a small chamber to the left of the stair-case which led to the floor on which they slept. It was Teague, who had got to bed to the girl of the house. For as they would neither let him go to Congress, nor be a philosopher, he must be doing something. The girl not being apprized, or not chusing his embraces, made a great outcry and lamentation. The clergyman, who slept in an adjoining chamber, and hearing this, out of the zeal of his benevolence and humanity, leaped out of bed in his shirt, and ran in to see what was the cause of the disturbance. The Captain also jumping up, followed soon after, and was scarcely in the chamber before the landlord coming up with a candle, found them all together. The maid gave this account of the matter, viz. That between sleeping and waking she felt a man's hand lifting up the bed-clothes; upon which she shouted out murder. But whether it was any body there present, or some one else, she could not tell. Teague, whose natural parts were not bad, and presence of mind considerable, instantly took the resolution to throw the matter on the clergyman. By shaint Patrick, said he, I was aslape in my own bed as sound as the shates that were about me, when I heard the sound of this young crature's voice crying out like a shape in a pasture; and when after I had heard, aslape as I was, and come here, I found this praste, who was so wholy, and praching all night, upon the top of the bed, with his arms round this young crature's neck; and if I had not given him a twitch by the nose, and bid him ly over, dear honey, he would have ravished her virginity, and murdered her, save her soul, and the paple of the house not the wiser for it. The clergyman stared with his mouth open; for the palpable nature of the falshood, had shocked him beyond the power of speech. But the landlady, who in the mean time was come up, and had heard what Teague had said, was enraged, could supply speech for them both. Hey, said she, this comes of your preaching and praying, Mr. Minister. I have lodged many a gentleman; but have never had such doings here before. It is a pretty story that a minister of the gospel should be the first to bring a scandal upon the house. The Captain interrupted her, and told her there was no harm done. The maid was not actually ravished; and if there was no noise made about it, all matters might be set right. The clergyman had by this time recovered himself so much as to have the use of his tongue; and began by protesting his innocence, and that it was no more him that made the attack upon the maid, than the angel Gabriel. The Captain, interrupting him, and wishing to save his feelings, began by excusing or extenuating the offence. It is no great affair, said he, after all that is said or done. The love of women is a natural sin, and the holiest men in all ages have been propense to this indulgence. There was Abraham that got to bed to his maid Hagar, and had a bastard by her, whom he named Ishmael. Joshua, who took Jericho by the sound of ram's horns, saved a likely slut of the name of Rahab, under a pretence that she had been civil to the spies he had sent out, but in reality because he himself took a fancy for her. I need say nothing about David, who wrote the Psalms, and set them to music; and yet in his old days had a girl to sleep with him. Human nature is human nature still; and it is not all the preaching and praying on earth can extinguish it. The clergyman averred his innocence, and that it was that red-headed gentleman himself, meaning Teague, who was in the room first, and had been guilty of the outrage. Teague was beginning to make the sign of the cross, and to put himself into an attitude of swearing, when the Captain thinking it of no consequence who was the person, put an end to the matter, by ordering Teague to bed, and himself bidding the company good night. The clergyman finding no better could be made of it, took the advice of the landlord, and retired also. The landlady seemed disposed to hush the matter up, and the maid went to sleep as usual. F CHAP. II. IT is not the nature of the female tongue to be silent. The landlady could not avoid informing her gossips, and even some of her guests, of what had happened the preceding evening in her house. The report, so unfavourable to the clergyman, had therefore got out; and coming to the ears of the consistory, was the occasion of calling him before them, to answer to the accusation. The clergyman much alarmed, though conscious of innocence, bethought himself of applying to the Captain, to extort from his waiting man a confession of the truth, and relieve his character. Accordingly having set out on a bay horse that he had, he found the Captain, and addressed him in the following manner: Captain, said he, the affair of that night at the tavern, is like to be of serious consequence to me. For though I am innocent as the child unborn, yet the presumption is against me, and I am likely to fall under church censure. It may be sport to you, but it is a matter of moment to me. Now, as sure as God is in heaven, I am innocent; and it must have been the devil, or that red headed Irishman of yours, that made the disturbance. The Captain gave him the comfort of assuring him that he might make himself easy; for be the matter as it might, he would take care that Teague should assume it, and bear the blame. The clergyman politely thanked him; declaring, at the same time, that he would not forget him in his prayers, Sunday or Saturday, while he had an hour to live. The Captain, not so much from any mercenary motive of benefit, by his spiritual solicitations, as from a real love of humanity and justice, had determined to do him essential service in this affair. Accordingly, when the clergyman had retired, calling Teague before him, he began in this manner: Teague, said he, from what I know of your disposition, I have no more doubt than I have of my existence, that it was yourself who made that uproar with the girl at the tavern where we lodged; though I could not but give you credit for your presence of mind in throwing it upon the clergyman. But whether the matter lies with you or him, is of no consequence. You can take it upon you, and lay up treasure in heaven. It will be doing a good work; and these people, you may be assured, have a considerable influence in the other world. This clergyman can speak a good word for you when you come there, and let you into half the benefit of all the prayers he has said on earth. It will be no harm to you, for your character in this respect is as bad as it can well be. Teague said he did not care much; but thought the priest ought to pay a little smart money; for it was a thankless matter to do these things for nothing. Said the Captain, these people are not the most plenty of money; but I will advance half a crown towards the accommodation. Teague was satisfied, and ready to acknowledge whatever was demanded of him. Accordingly having come before the presbytery on the day appointed for the trial. Teague made confession of the truth; viz. That being in the kitchen with the girl, and observing her to be a good looking hussy — But suppose we give the speech in his own dialect. Master prastes, said he, I persave you are all prastes of the gosple, and can prach as asily as I can take a chaw of tobacco. Now the trut of de story is dis; I was slaping in my bed, and I tought vid myself it was a shame amonst christian paple that a young crature should slape by herself, and have no one to take care of her. So I tought vid myself, to go and slape vid her. But as she was aslape, she made exclamation, and dis praste that is here before you, came in to save her shoul from the devil; and as the captain my master, might take offence, and the devil, I am shartain that it was no better person, put it into my head, to lay it on the praste This is the trut master prastes, as I hope for shalvation in the kingdom of purgatory, shentlemen. On this confession, the clergyman was absolved, to the great joy of the presbytery, who considered it as a particular providence that the truth was brought to light. F 2 CHAP. III. Containing Reflections. IT must appear from the incident at the public house, with what caution presumptive testimony is to be admitted. Our criminal law admits it, but lays it down as a rule, that it be admitted with caution. There is what is called violent presumption; that is, where such circumstances exist, as usually attend the fact. Presumptive proof of this nature is held sufficient to convict. I doubt much, whether reason or experience approve the doctrine. Reason tells us, that there may be all the circumstances that usually attend the fact, and yet without the fact itself. Experience evinces that it has been the case; for we have heard of persons convicted of a capital offence; and yet with their last breath asserting innocence. Nay, in the case of some who have been convicted of homicide, the persons who have been supposed to have been murdered, have afterwards been found alive. But on abstract principles, a conclusion of certainty cannot be drawn from presumptive proof. Because in cases of the most violent presumption, there is still a possibility of innocence; and where there is a possibility, there must be a doubt; and will you hang man, woman, or child, where there is a doubt. In all cases there ought to be complete proof; because the convicted person is to be completely punished; and the jury, previous to this, must make complete oath of the guilt. It is the ground of the doctrine of presumptive proof, that where you cannot help suspecting, you ought to be positive; whereas the just conclusion would be, that where you cannot help suspecting, there you ought to suspect still, but no more. It would be a curious question in arithmetic how many uncertainties make a certainty? In mathematics, the three angles of a triangle, are equal to a right angle. But these are all angles, that are put together; that is, they are things of the same kind, but the greatest angle, and the longest side will never make a triangle, because there is no inclusion of space. There must be a number of things of the same kind to make an aggregate whole; so that ten thousand possibilities, probabilities, and violent presumptions, can never constitute a certainty. Presumptive proof is of the nature of the semi plena probatio of the Roman law; going but half-way towards proof, it can never amount to proof at all. For, as the saying is, a miss is as good as a mile. I would, therefore, recommend to all jurors, to take care that unless the witnesses swear positively to the fact, they do not find a verdict, guilty; because, as the current cannot rise higher than the source, so the verdict of the juror ought not to be more absolute than the oath of the witness. In all cases, therefore, short of positive testimony, acquit. These hints may also be of service to young attornies, and weak judges; so that honest people may not lose their lives, or be rendered infamous, without full proof of the offence. It is hard enough to suffer when there is full proof; but to be in the power of a juror's or a judge's imagination, comparing and construing circumstances, and weighing possibilities, contingencies, caprice, wheel, or whim of the brain may suggest, is inconsistent with that fair trial which, in a free government, ought to be enjoyed. Was I a judge or juror, no one would I condemn without positive testimony of the fact. For it would not be in my power to restore that fame or life which I took away from the innocent. And if a guilty person should escape, it was none of my look out; but the business of Providence to furnish proof, if it was intended that man should punish; and if proof is not furnished, let Providence take the matter on himself, and punish the culprit either in this life or in a future state. Invisible things belong to the Omniscient; and it would seem great arrogance in man to take upon him to decide in cases of uncertainty. I hope, therefore, yet to see the doctrine of presumptive proof, in criminal cases, wholly, in courts of justice, discountenanced. I can declare, that in the course of my experience at the bar, I have bad one hung, and several others within an ace of it, who were innocent; and this on the doctrine of presumption and probability. The one that was hung was a tory case, where the popular clamour was against the man; and light presumption became violent, under such a charge. I shall say no more on this subject; because it seems to me that I have been affecting to speak sense, whereas my business is to speak nonsense; this being the only way to keep out of the reach of criticism; because critics can say no more than you yourself allow; so that a charge of nonsense cannot hurt. It is thus that persons who have a long nose, or disproportion of some other feature, take the laugh upon themselves first, and so escape ridicule. The truth is, I will not give myself the trouble to write sense long. For I would as soon please fools as wise men; because the fools are the most numerous, and every prudent man will go with the majority. I shall return to the adventures of the Captain. CHAP. IV. THE Presbytery sat a day or two at this place, on church affairs, and the Captain delaying with them, lodged at the same house. Teague, in the mean time, having an opportunity of ingratiating himself with the clergymen, by rubing down their horses, and other menial services. For it is the national character of the aboriginal Irish, to give fair words; and Teague was not deficient in this address. What with master Prasting, and giving a great deal of what is called Blarney, he insinuated himself into their good graces; and by affecting, now and then, to be seen at prayers by himself, and to have a sorrowful countenance, he induced them to believe that he was in the first stage of conviction, and likely to become a pious man. Having made this progress in their good opinion, he ventured to suggest what was the ultimate object of his ambition; viz. the being a candidate for holy orders. The Presbytery, to whom the matter was represented by the individuals more particularly acquainted with him, thought favourably of the proposition. For though his common attainments might not be great, yet if the grace of God had wrought upon him, he might become a valuable man. The Captain having got a hint of this, took the first opportunity of addressing the Presbytery. Gentlemen, said he, you are deceived in this ragamuffin. For, notwithstanding all the pretensions he may lately have to religion, you may be well assured that it is all hypocrisy, and that he has no more religion than my horse. The Presbytery suspecting the Captain to be a carnal man, and regardless of the ministry, gave little heed to what he said, and seemed disposed to take Teague upon trials. The Captain finding the case to stand thus, and that in spite of all he could do, he was likely to lose his servant, took his usual method of addressing the hopes and fears of Teague himself. Taking him aside, he began, with all possible art, to impress such fears and apprehensions, as the nature of the case suggested. Teague, said he, do you know what you are about? You have got into your vagaries once more. You want to preach, do you? Are you apprised of the difficulty of this work? The first thing you will have to do, is to take a text; and when that is done, you have to split it into parts. There are what are called heads; and these you must divide into firstlys, and secondlys, and thirdlys, and fourthlys, and so on, till you come to twentiethlys, perhaps. Are you furnished with a concordance? or do you know what a concordance is? Can you find a text to suit your purpose when you want it? Can you explain the scriptures; the meaning of Daniel's ram and the he-goat, or the seven trumpets in the Revelations? You are mistaken if you think your Irish will pass for Hebrew. You think it a great honour to preach now-a days. It was an honour once; but the thing is now become so common, that it is of little consequence to preach or not. But do you know how it will behove you to conduct yourself, if you take this office upon you. You will have to compose the muscles of your face to greater seriousness than your disposition can afford. You must quit whoring. How will you like that, Teague. It would look very ill after G sermon to be catched in bed with a girl at a tavern. But do you know why these men are so anxious to have you of their mess? The truth of the matter is, they carry on a war with the devil, and they wish to recruit you for the service. Do they give you any bounty-money. Take my word, there will be but little of this going. Take my advice then, and let them settle their own quarrels. It is a silly thing to be drawn into a party, when there is but little to be got by it: Nay, worse than little: For it will be all on the other side. Think you the devil will forget the mischief you do him in this world, and not resent it when he comes across you in a future state? When you are preaching and praying, do you think he will not hear all that you throw out against him. You may rely upon it, there will be enough to give him information; and as a story never loses in the telling, it is ten to one they will make the matter worse than it was. Take my advice, therefore, and make no enemies while you can help it. Steer through life as smoothly as possible. Keep a good tongue in your mouth, and let those who chuse to dispute with Belzebub, dispute. I never knew any good come of broils and quarrels, especially with low characters. And, to say the truth of it, this Satan, as they call him, is very little of the gentleman. Even where he is well disposed, he will do but little good to one; but a most dangerous creature where he takes a dislike. When you go to hell, as, one day, you must, you can expect but little quarter, after abusing him in this world. He will make you squeel like a pig; take you by the throat, and kick you like a cat. His very scullions will piss upon you, and give you no better life than a dog among their feet; while these very clergymen, that put you forward to blackguard for them, will stand by laughing in their sleeves that you could be such a fool. The representation had the desired effect upon Teague, and he thought no more of the matter. CHAP. V. The Conclusion, with Observations. THE overtures made by Teague, to be admitted to the ministry, and the simplicity of the ecclesiastics in listening to his pretensions, made a great noise through the neighbourhood; in as much as the young man laboured under a want of education, and was not qualified by theological reading. But I do not see, why it should be thought blamable; provided the matter was not too much hurried and hastily brought forward. For give him a little time, and he might have been instructed to preach as well as some that I myself have heard. Especially if at first setting out, he had confined himself to historical passages of scripture; such as the history of Sampson, and Gideon, and Barak, and the like: Only he must have taken care that in pronouncing Barak, with the brogue upon his tongue, he did not make it Burke; for that is a patronimic name of his country, and he might inadvertently have fallen into this pronunciation. I acknowledge, that in the regular churches, such as that of the Presbyterians, there is still kept up some opinion of the necessity of literature. But do we not see that with other denominations; such as the Quakers, the Methodists, and Anabaptists, it is totally disregarded and thrown out? Because when human gifts or acquirements are absent, that which is supernatural more evidently appears. Do not Quakers, and Methodists, and Baptists, preach very well? At any rate, they do a great deal of good, and that is the first object of preaching. Whether such sermonists, avail themselves most of sense or sound, I will not say; but so it is they do good; and that without the aid of any human learning whatever. It is very true, that formerly in the infancy of the church, a knowledge of languages and sciences, might be requisite. But the case is quite altered now. The Scripture has been well explained, and frequently preached over; every text and context examined, and passages illustrated. The Hebrew roots, so to speak, have been all dug up; and there is scarcely a new G 2 etymology to be made. Are there any new doctrines to discover? I should think it impossible. At any rate, I should conceive it unnecessary. There are enough in all conscience: The inventing more, would be like bringing timber to a wood, or coals to Newcastle. This being the case, I feel myself disposed to agree with those who reject human learning in religious matters altogether. More especially as science is really not the fashion at the present time. For as has been before seen, even in the very province of science itself, it is dispensed with; that of natural philosophy, for instance. In state affairs, ignorance does very well, and why not in church? I am for having all things of a piece; ignorant statesmen, ignorant philosophers, and ignorant ecclesiastics. On this principle, Teague might have done very well as a preacher. But the selfishness of the Captain prevailed, and obstructed his advancement.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">BOOK IV. CHAP. I. Containing preliminary Observations. I AM very happy in the composition of this work; for though but of a trifling nature as to sentiment; yet, in what I do write, no one can attribute to me the least tincture of satire, or ridicule of individuals or public bodies. This is what I very much dislike in others, and would be far from indulging in myself. I acknowledge, indeed, that in my earlier years, and in the course of my academical studies, I had contracted some taste, and even habit, this way; owing to my reading the dialogues of Lucian, in the original Greek. Had I read them in a translation, they might have made less impression. But by means of a difficult language, studying them slowly, the turn of thought became more deeply impressed upon my mind. Moreover, afterwards, when I came to have some acquaintance with the modern wits, such as Cervantes, Le Sage, and especially Swift, I found myself still more inclined to an ironical, ludicrous way of thinking and writing. But finding the bad effects of this, in many respects, leading me into broils with individuals, and rendering me obnoxious to public bodies, I saw the indiscretion, and bad policy of such indulgence; and have for several years past, carefully avoided every thing of this kind. It is indeed acting but a poor part in life, to make a business of laughing at the follies of others. It is injurious to one's self; for there is a great deal more to be gained by soothing and praising what men do, than by finding fault with them. It may be said of satire, what was said of anger by some philosopher, It never pays the service it requires. It is your scratching, rump-tickling people, that get into place and power. I never knew any good come of wit and humour yet. They are talents which keep the owner poor. For this reason, I have taken care to repress all propensity to this vice; and I believe I can say it with truth, that since I have come to the years of a man's understanding, I have carefully avoided every thing of this nature. Had it not been for this prudence, I should not have been in a fair way, as I now am, to be a member of Congress, or a judge on the bench, or governor of a commonwealth, or secretary of state, or any thing that I may have in view. Had I remained an admirer of Rabelais, or Sterne, or other biting, jeering writers, that I at first met with, I might at this day have been considered as a wit only, without the least advancement in state affairs. But I would sooner see your Juniuses, and your Peter Pindars, libelling kings and ministers, at hell, than sacrifice my interest to my passion, or my vanity, by strokes of wit, which is but another name for ill-nature. In this treatise, which is simply a relation of the adventures of an individual, I have nothing to do with strictures upon particular persons, or the affairs of men in general, and so have no temptation to the folly I have just mentioned. The reader, if any body ever reads it, will find nothing here but philanthropic and benevolent ideas. Indeed, as it has been known that I was engaged in writing something, persons who either took, or pretended to take, some interest in my affairs, have urged me very much to depart a little from my usual way, and make use of a little irony, by way of seasoning to the composition; for, in this case, it would be received better, and procure more readers; mankind being naturally delighted with ridicule. But the truth was, I could see nothing to be ironical about; owing, perhaps, to my not being in the habit of looking for the ridiculous, and so having lost the talent of discovering it. But my resolution that I had taken would have fully preserved me from such a lapse, however numerous the objects of ridicule might be, that presented themselves. This will serve as an apology to those who have solicited me on this head, and relieve me from such solicitations for the future. CHAP. II. DETAINING some time in a village, there was a great deal said about a certain Miss Fog, who was the belle of the place. Her father had made a fortune by the purchuse of public securities A garrison having been at this place, and troops quartered here, he had been employed as an issuing commissary! When the commissioners sat to adjust unliquidated claims, he had a good deal in his power, by vouching for the accounts of the butcher, and baker, and wood-cutter, and water-drawer, and waggoner, and all others of all occupations whatsoever, whose claims were purchased by himself, in the mean time, and when the certificates issued in their names, they were to his use. The butcher and baker, no doubt, long before had been paid out of the flesh killed, or bread baked; because it is a good maxim, and a scriptural expression, “Muzzle not the ox that treadeth out the corn.” But the public has a broad back, and a little vouching, by a person interested, is not greatly felt. These certificates, though at first of little value, and issued by the commissioners with the liberality of those who give what is of little worth, yet by the funding acts of the government, having become, in value, equal to gold and silver, the commissary had a great estate thrown upon him; so that, from low beginnings, he had become a man of fortune and consequence. His family, and especially the eldest daughter, shared the advantage; for she had become the object of almost all wooers. The Captain, though an old bachelor, as we have said, had not wholly lost the idea of matrimony. Happening to be in a circle, one evening, where Miss Fog was, he took a liking to her, in all respects save one, which was, that she seemed, on her part, to have taken a liking to a certain Mr. Jacko, who was there present; and to whose attention she discovered a facility of acquiescence. The Captain behaved, for the present, as if he did not observe the preference; but the following day, waiting on the young lady at her father's house, he drew her into conversation, and began to reason with her, in the following manner: Miss Fog, said he, you are a young lady of great beauty, great sense, and fortune still greater than either.—This was a sad blunder in a man of gallantry, but the lady not being of the greatest sensibility of nerve, did not perceive it.—On my part, said he, I am a man of years, but a man of some reflection; and it would be much more adviseable in you to trust my experience, and the mellowness of my disposition in a state of matrimony, than the vanity and petulence of this young fop Jacko, for whom you shew a partiality. The colour coming into the young lady's face at this expression, she withdrew, and left him by himself. The Captain struck with the rudeness, withdrew also, and, calling Teague from the kitchen, mounted his horse and set off. The next morning shortly after he had got out of bed, and had just come down stairs at his lodging, and was buttoning the knees of his breeches, a light airy looking young man, with much bowing and civility, entered the hall of the public house, and enquiring if this was not Captain Farrago to whom he had the honour to address H himself, delivered him a paper. On the perusal, it was found to be a challenge from Mr. Jacko. The fact was, that Miss Fog, in order the more to recommend herself to her suitor, had informed him of the language of the Captain. The young man, though he had no great stomach for the matter, yet according to the custom of these times, could do no less than challenge. The bearer was was what is called his second. The Captain having read the paper, and pausing a while, said, Mr. Second, for that I take to be your stile and character, is it consistent with reason or common sense, to be the aider or abettor of another man's folly; perhaps the prompter: for it is no uncommon thing with persons to inflame the passions of their frends, rather than allay them. This young woman, for I shall not call her lady, from vanity, or ill-nature, or both, has become a tale-bearer to her lover, who, I will venture to say, thanks her but little for it; as she has thereby rendered it necessary for him to take this step. You, in the mean time, are not blameless, as it became you to have declined the office, and thereby furnished an excuse to your friend for not complying with the custom. For it would have been a sufficient apology with the lady to have said, although he was disposed to fight, yet he could get no one to be his armour-bearer or assistant. It could have been put upon the footing, that all had such regard for his life, that no one would countenance him in risking it. You would have saved him by this means, all that uneasiness which he feels at present, least I should accept his challenge. I am not so unacquainted with human nature, as not to know how disagreeable it must be to think of having a pistol ball lodged in the groin or the left breast, or, to make the best of it, the pan of the knee broke, or the nose cut off, or some wound less than mortal given; disagreeable, especially to to a man in the bloom of life, and on the point of marriage with a woman to whose person or fortune he has no exception. I would venture to say, therefore, there will be no great difficulty in appeasing this Orlando Furioso, that has sent me the challenge. Did you know the state of his mind, you would find him at prayers this moment, that I would ease his fears, and make some apology. A very slight one would suffice. I dare say, his resentment against Miss Fog is not slight, and that he would renounce her person and fortune both, to get quit of the duel. But the opinion of the world is against him, and he must fight. Do you think he has any great gratitude to you for your services on this occasion. He had much rather you had, in the freedom of friendship, given him a kick on the backside, when he made application to you; and told him, that it did not become him to quarrel about a woman, who had, probably, consulted but her own vanity, in giving him the information. In that case, he would have been more pleased with you a month hence, than he is at present. I do not know that he has an overstock of sense; nevertheless, he cannot be just such a fool, as not to consider, that you, yourself, may have pretensions to this belle, and be disposed to have him out of the way before you. He must be a fool, indeed, if he does not reflect, that you had much rather see us fight than not; from the very same principle that we take delight in seeing a cock-match, or a horse-race. The spectacle is new, and produces a brisk current of thought through the mind; which is a constituent of pleasure, the absence of all movement giving none at all. What do you suppose I must think of you, Mr. Second; I, who have read books, and thought a little on the subject; have made up my mind in these matters, and account the squires that bring challenges from knights, as people of but very small desert. Thinking men have condemned the duel, and laws have prohibited it; but these miscreants still keep it up, by being the conductors of the fluid. My indignation, therefore, falls on such, and I have long ago fixed on the mode of treating them. It is this: a stout athletic man calls upon me, with a challenge in his hand, I knock him down, if I can, without saying a word. If the natural arm be not sufficient for this purpuse, I avail myself of any stone, wooden, or iron instrument that I cast my eye upon, not just to take away his life, if I can help it; but to hit the line as exactly as possible, between actual homicide, and a very bad wound. For in this case, I should conceive, a battery could be justifiable, or at least excuseable, and the fine not very great; the bearing a challenge being a breach of the peace, in the first instance. This would be my H 2 conduct with a stout athletic man, whom I might think it dangerous to encounter with fair warning, and on equal terms. But in the present case, where—(Here the second began to shew signs of fear, raising himself, and inclining backwards, opening his eyes wider, and casting a look towards the door)—where, continued the Captain, I have to do with a person of your slender make, I do not adopt that surprise, or use an artificial weapon; but with these fists, which have been used in early life to agricultural employments, I shall very deliberately impress a blow. The second rising to his feet, began to recede a little. Be under no apprehensions, said the Captain; I shall use no unfair method of biting, gouging, or wounding the private parts. Nay, as you appear to be a young man of a delicate constitution, I shall only choak a little. You will give me leave to take you by the throat in as easy a manner as possible. In the mean time, the second had been withdrawing towards the door, and the Captain with outstretched arms, in a sideway direction, proceeding to intercept him. In an instant, he was seized by the neck, and the exclamation of murder which he made at the first grasp, began to die away in hoarse guttural murmurs of one nearly strangled, and labouring for breath. The Captain meaning that he should be more alarmed than hurt, dismissed him with a salutation of his foot on the backside, as a claude ostium, as he went out. You may be, said he, a gentleman in the opinion of the world; but you are a low person in mine; and so shall it be done to every one who shall come upon such an errand. CHAP. III. HAVING thus dismissed the secondary man, he called in his servant Teague, and accosted him as follows: Teague, said he, you have heretofore discovered an ambition to be employed in some way that would advance your reputation. There is now a case fallen out, to which you are fully competent. It is not a matter that requires the head to contrive, but the hand to execute. The greatest fool is as fit for it as a wise man. It is indeed your greatest blockheads that chiefly undertake it. The knowledge of law, physic, or divinity is out of the question. Literature, and political understanding is useless. Nothing more is necessary than a little resolution of the heart. Yet it is an undertaking which is of much estimation with the rabble, and has a great many on its side to approve and praise it. The females of the world, especially admire the act, and call it valour. I know you wish to stand well with the ladies. Here is an opportunity of advancing your credit. I have had what is called a challenge sent me this morning. It is from a certain Jacko, who is a suitor to a Miss Fog, and has taken offence at an expression of mine, respecting him to this female. I wish you to accept the challenge, and fight him for me. At this proposition, Teague looked wild, and made apology that he was not much used to boxing. Boxing, said the Captain; you are to fight what is called a duel. You are to encounter him with pistol, and put a bullet through him if you can. It is true, he will have the chance of putting one through you; but in that consists the honour; for where there is no danger, there is no glory. You will provide yourself a second. There is an hostler here at the public house, that is a brave fellow, and will answer the purpose. Being furnished with a second, you will provide yourself with a pair of pistols, powder and ball of course. In the mean time, your adversary notified of your intentions, will do the like. Thus apparalelled, you will advance to the place agreed upon. The ground will be measured out; ten, seven, or five steps; back to back, and coming round to your place, fire. Or taking your ground, stand still and fire; or it may be, advance and fire as you meet, at what distance you think proper. The rules in this respect are not fixed, but as the parties can agree or the seconds point out. When you come to fire, be sure you keep a steady hand, and take good aim. Remember that the pistol barrel being short, the powder is apt to throw the bullet up. Your sight therefore, ought to be about the waist-band of his breeches, so that you have the whole length of his body, and his head into the bargain, to come and go upon. It is true, he in the mean time, will take the same advantages of you. He may hit you about the groin, or the belly. I have known some shot in the thigh, or the leg, or the private parts. The throat also, and the head are in themselves vulnerable. It is no uncommon thing to have an arm broke, or a splinter struck off the nose, or an eye shot out; but as in that case, the ball mostly passes through the brain, and the man being dead at any rate, the loss of sight is not greatly felt. As the Captain spoke, Teague seemed to feel in himself, every wound which was described, the ball hitting him, now in one part, and now in another. At the last words, it seemed to pass through his head, and he was half dead, in imagination. Making a shift to express himself, he gave the Captain to understand, that he could by no means undertake the office. What! said the Captain; you whom nothing would serve, some time ago, but to be a legislator, or philosopher, or preacher, in order to gain fame, will now detract a business for which you are qualified. This requires no knowledge of finances, no reading of natural history, or any study of the fathers. You have nothing more to do than to keep a steady hand and a good eye. In the early practice of this exercise; I mean the combat of the duel, it was customary to exact an oath of the combatants, before they entered the lists, that they had no enchantments, or power of witchcraft, about them. Whether you should think it necessary to put him to his voir dire, on this point, I shall not say; but I am persuaded, that on your part, you have too much honour, to make use of spells, or undue means, to take away his life, or save your own. You will leave all to the chance of fair shooting. One thing you will observe, and which is allowable in this battle, you will take care not to present yourself to him with a full breast, but angularly, and your head turned round over the left shoulder, like a weather cock. For thus a smaller surface being presented to an adversary, he will be less likely to hit you. You must throw your legs into lines parallel, and keep them one directly behind the other. Thus you will stand like a sail hauled close to the wind. Keep a good countenance, a sharp eye, and a sour look; and if you feel any thing like a cholic or a palpitation of the heart, make no noise about it. If the ball should take you in the gills, or the gizzard, fall down as decently as you can, and die like a man of honour. It was of no use to urge the matter; the Irishman was but the more opposed to the proposition, and utterly refused to be after fighting in any such manner. The Captain finding this to be the case, dismissed him to clean his boots and spurs, and rub down his horse in the stable. CHAP. IV. ON reflection, it seemed adviseable to the Captain to write an answer to the card which Colonel, or Major Jacko, or whatever his title may have been, had sent him this morning. It was as follows: Sir, I have two objections to this duel matter. The one is, lest I should hurt you; and the other is, lest you should hurt me. I do not see any good it would do me to put a bullet through any part of your body. I could make no use of you when dead, for any culinary purpose, as I would a rabbit or a turkey. I am no cannibal to feed on the flesh of men. Why then shoot down a human creature, of which I could make no use. A buffalo would be better meat. For though your flesh might be delicate and tender; yet it wants that firmness and consistency which takes and retains salt. At any rate it would not be fit for long sea voyages. You might make a good barbecue, it is true, being of the nature of a racoon or an opossum; I but people are not in the habit of barbecuing any thing human now. As to your hide, it is not worth the taking off, being little better than that of a year old colt. It would seem to me a strange thing to shoot at a man that would stand still to be shot at; in as much as I have been heretofore used to shoot at things flying, or running, or jumping. Were you on a tree now like a squirrel, endeavouring to hide yourself in the branches, or like a racoon, that after much eyeing and spying I observe at length in the crotch of a tall oak, with boughs and leaves intervening, so that I could just get a sight of his hinder parts, I should think it pleasurable enough to take a shot at you. But as it is, there is no skill or judgment requisite either to discover or take you down. As to myself, I do not much like to stand in the way of any thing that is harmful. I am under apprehensions you might hit me. That being the case, I think it most adviseable to stay at a distance. If you want to try your pistols, take some object, a tree or a barn door about my dimensions. If you hit that, send me word, and I shall acknowledge that if I had been in the same place, you might also have hit me. J. Farrago. CHAP. V. Containing Reflections. CAPTAIN Farrago was a good man, but unacquainted with the world. His ideas were drawn chiefly from what may be called the old school; the Greek and Roman notions of things. The combat of the duel was to them unknown. Though it seems strange, that a people who were famous for almost all arts and sciences, should have remained ignorant of its use. I do not conceive how, as a people, they could exist without it. But so it was, they actually were without the knowledge of it. For we do not find any trace of this custom in the poets or historians of all antiquity. I do not know at what period, precisely, the custom was introduced; or to whom it was owing; but omitting this disquisition, we content ourselves with observing, that it has produced as great improvement in manners, as the discovery of the load-stone, and mariner's compass, has at navigation. Not that I mean to descant, at full length, on the valuable effects of it; but simply to observe, that it is a greater aid to government than the alliance of church and state itself. If Dr. Warburton had had leisure, I could wish he had written a treatise upon it. Some affect to ridicule it, as carrying to a greater length small differences, than the aggravation may justify. As for instance, a man is angry enough with you to give you a slap in the face; but the custom says, he must shoot you through the head. I think the smaller the aggravation, the nicer the sense of honour. The heaviest mind will resent a gross affront; but to kill a man where there is no affront at all, shews a great sensibility. It is immaterial whether there is or is not an injury, provided the world thinks there is; for it is the opinion of mankind we are to consult. It is a duty which we owe them to provide for their amusement. Non nasscimur nobis ipsis; we are not born for ourselves, but for others. Decorum pro patria mori; it is a becoming thing to die for one's country; and shall it not also be accounted honourable to throw one's life away for the entertainment of a few particular neighbours and acquaintances. It is true, the tears that will be shed upon your grave, will not make the grass grow; but you will have the consolation, when you leave the world, to have fallen in the bed of honour. It is certainly a very noble institution, that of the duel; and it has been carried to very great perfection, in some respects. Nevertheless, I would submit it to the public, whether still further improvement might not be made in the laws and regutions of it. For instance, could it not be reduced nearer to an equality of chances, by proportioning the caliber, or bore or the pistol; the length of the barrel, also, to the size of the duellist who holds it; or by fixing the ratio of distance in proportion to the bulk of combatants. To explain myself: When I am to fight a man of a small size, I ought to have a longer pistol than my adversary, because my mark is smaller; or I ought to be permitted to come nearer to him. For it is altogether unfair that men of unequal bulk should fire at equal distances, and with equal calibers. The smaller size multiplied by the larger space, or larger pistol, would equal the larger size multiplied by I 2 the smaller space or smaller pistol. If this amendment of the duel laws should be approved by men of honour, let it be added to the code.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">BOOK V. CHAP. I. NOT long after this, being at a certain place, the Captain was accosted by a stranger in the following manner: Captain Farrago, said he, I have heard of a young man in your service who talks Irish. Now, Sir, my business is that of an Indian treaty-maker; and am on my way with a party of kings, and half kings to the commissioners, to hold a treaty. My king of the Kickapoos, who was a Welch blacksmith, took sick by the way, and is dead. I have heard of this lad of yours, and could wish to have him a while to supply his place. The treaty will not last longer than a couple of weeks; and as the government will probably allow three or four thousand dollars for the treaty, it will be in our power to make it worth your while, to spare him for that time. Your king of the Kickapoos, said the Captain; what does that mean? Said the stranger, it is just this: You have heard of the Indian nations to the westward, that occasionally make war upon the frontier settlements. It has been a policy of government, to treat with these, and distribute goods. Commissioners are appointed for that purpose. Now you are not to suppose that it is always an easy matter to catch a real chief, and bring him from the woods; or if at some expence one was brought, the goods would go to his use; whereas, it is much more profitable to hire substitutes and make chiefs of our own: And as some unknown gibberish is necessary, to pass for an Indian language, we generally make use of Welch, or Low Dutch, or Irish; or pick up an ingenious fellow here and there, who can imitate a language by sounds of his own, in his mouth, and throat. But we prefer one who can speak a real tongue, and give more for him. We cannot afford you a great deal at this time for the use of your man; because it is not a general treaty where 20,000, or 30,000, dollars are appropriated for the purpose of holding it; but an occasional, or what we call a running treaty, by way of brightening the chain, and holding fast friendship. The commissioners will doubtless be glad to see us, and procure from government an allowance for the treaty. For the more treaties, the more use for commissioners. The business must be kept up, and treaties made if there are none of themselves. My Pianksha, and Choctaw chiefs, are very good fellows; the one of them a Scotch pedlar that talks the Erse; the other has been some time in Canada, and has a little broken Indian, God knows what language; but has been of great service in assisting to teach the rest some Indian custom and manners. I have had the whole of them for a fortnight past under my tuition, teaching them war songs and dances, and to make responses at the treaty. If your man is tractable, I can make him a Kickapoo in about nine days. A breech-clout and leggins, that I took off the blacksmith that died, I have ready to put on him. He must have part of his head shaved, and painted, with feathers on his crown; but the paint will rub off, and the hair grow in a short time, so that he can go about with you again. It is a very strange affair, said the Captain. Is it possible that such deception can be practised in a new country. It astonishes me, that the government does not detect such imposition. The government, said the Indian treaty-man, is at a great distance. It knows no more of Indians than a cow does of Greek. The legislature, hears of wars and rumours of wars, and supports the executive in forming treaties. How is it possible for men who live remote from the scene of action, to have adequate ideas of the nature of Indians, or the transactions that are carried on in their behalf. Do you think the one half of those savages that come to treat, are real representatives of the nation. Many of them are not savages at all; but weavers, and pedlars, as I have told you, picked up to make kings and chiefs. I speak of those particularly that come trading down to inland towns, or the metropolis. I would not communicate these mysteries of our trade, were it not that I confide in your good sense, and have occasion for your servant. It is a mystery of iniquity, said the Captain. Do you suppose that I would countenance such a fraud upon the public? I do not know, said the other; it is a very common thing for men to speculate, now a-days. If you will not, another will. An 100 dollars might as well be in your pocket as another man's. I will give you that for the use of your servant, for a week or two, and say no more about it. It is an idea new to me entirely, said the Captain, that Indian princes, whom I have seen escorted down as such, were no more than trumpery, disguised, as you mention; that such should be introduced to polite assemblies, and have the honour to salute the fair ladies with a kiss, the greatest beauties thinking themselves honoured by having the salutation of a sovereign? It is so, said the other; I had a red headed bricklayer once, whom I passed for a Chippawaw; and who has dined with clubs, and sat next the President. He was blind of an eye, and was called blind Sam by the traders. I had given it out that he was a great warrior, and had lost his eye by an arrow, in a contest with a rival nation. These things are now reduced to a system; and it is so well known to those who are engaged in the traffic, that we think nothing of it. How the devil, said the Captain, do you get speeches made, and interpret them so as to pass for truth. That is an easy matter, said the other; Indian speeches are nearly all alike. You have only to talk of burying hatchets under large trees, kindling fires, brightening chains; with a demand, at the latter end, of blankets for the backside, and rum to get drunk with. I much doubt, said the Captain, whether treaties that are carried on in earnest, are of any great use. Of none at all, said the other; especially as the practice of giving goods prevails; because this is an inducement to a fresh war. This being the case, it can be no harm to make a farce of the whole matter; or rather a profit of it; by such means as I propose to you, and have pursued myself. After all, said the Captain, I cannot but consider it as a kind of contraband and illicit traffic; and I must be excused from having any hand in it. I shall not betray your secret, but I shall not favour it. It would ill become me, whose object in riding about in this manner, is to give just ideas on subjects, to take part in such ill-gotten gain. The Indian-treaty man finding it in vain to say more, withdrew. CHAP. II. THE Captain apprehending that he might not yet drop his designs upon the Irishman, but be tampering with him out of doors, should he come across him, sent for Teague. For he well knew, that should the Indian treaty man get the first word of him, the idea of making him a king, would turn his head, and it would be impossible to prevent his going with him. Teague coming in, said the Captain to him; Teague, I have discovered in you, for some time past, a great spirit of ambition, which is, doubtless, commendable in a young person; and I have checked it only in cases where there was real danger, or apparent mischief. There is now an opportunity of advancing yourself, not so much in the way of honour as profit. But profit brings honour, and is, indeed, the most substantial support of it. There has been a man here with me, that carries on a trade with the Indians, and tells me that red-headed scalps are in great demand with K them. If you could spare yours, he would give a good price for it. I do not well know what use they make of this article, but so it is the traders find their account in it. Probably they dress it with the hairy fide out, and make tobacco pouches for the chiefs, when they meet in council. It faves dyeing, and besides, the natural red hair of a man, may, in their estimation, be superior to any colour they can give by art. The taking off the scalp will not give much pain, it is so dextrously done by them with a crooked knife they have for that purpose. The mode of taking off the scalp is this; you lie down upon your back; a warrior puts his feet upon your shoulders, collects your hair in his left hand, and drawing a circle with the knife in his right, makes the incision, and, with a sudden pull, separates it from the head, giving, in the mean time, what is called the scalp yell. The thing is done in such an instant, that the pain is scarcely felt. He offered me an 100 dollars, if I would have it taken off for his use, giving me directions, in the mean time, how to stretch it and dry it on a hoop. I told him, No; it was a perquisite of your own, and you might dispose of it as you thought proper. If you chose to dispose of it, I had no objections; but the bargain should be of your own making, and the price such as should please yourself. I have sent for you, to give you a hint of this chapman, that you may have a knowledge of his wish to possess the property, and ask accordingly. It is probable you may bring him up to a half Johannes more, by holding out a little. But I do not think it would be adviseable to lose the bargain. An hundred dollars for a little hairy flesh, is a great deal. You will trot a long time before you make that with me. He will be with you probably to propose the purchase. You will know when you see him. He is a tall looking man, with leggins on, and has several Indians with him going to a treaty. He talked to me something of making you a king of the Kickapoos, after the scalp is off; but I would not count on that so much; because words are but wind, and promises are easily broken. I would advise you to make sure of the money in the first place, and take chance for the rest. I have seen among the prints of Hogarth, some such expression of countenance as that of Teague at this instant; who, as soon as he could speak, but with a double brogue on his tongue, began to intimate his disinclination to the traffic. The hair of his scalp itself, in the mean time had risen in opposition to it. Dear master, vid you trow me into ridicule, and the blessed shalvation of my life, and all dat I have in the vorld, to be trown like a dog to de savages, and have my flesh tarn of my head to give to dese vild bastes to make a napsack to carry their parates and tings in, for an 100 dollars or the like. It shall never be said that the hair of the Oregans made mackeseens for a vild Indian to trat upon. I would sooner trow my own head hair and all in de fire, dan give it to dese paple to smoke wid, out of deir long pipes. If this be your determination, said the Captain, it will behove you to keep yourself somewhat close; and while we remain at this public house, avoid any conversation with the chapman or his agents, should they come to tamper with you. For it is not improbable, while they are keeping you in talk, proposing to make you a Kickapoo chief, and the like, they may snatch the scalp of your head, and you not be the wiser for it. Teague thought the caution good, and resolving to abide by it, retired to the kitchen. The maid at this time, happening to want a log of wood, requested Teague to cut it for her. Taking the ax accordingly, and going out, he was busy chopping, with his head down; while, in the mean time, the Indian treaty-man had returned with one in Indian dress, who was the chief of the Killinoos, or at least passed for such; and whom he brought as having some recruiting talents, and might prevail with Teague to elope, and join the company. I presume, said the Indian treaty-man, you are the waiter of the Captain who lodges here at present. Teague hearing a man speak, and lifting up his head, saw the leggins on the one, and the Indian dress on the other; and with a kind of involuntary effort, threw the ax directly from him at the Killinoo. It missed him but about an inch, and fell behind. Teague, in the mean time, raising a shout of desperation, was fixed on the spot, and his locomotive faculties suspended; so that he could neither retreat nor advance, but stood still, like one enchained or enchanted for a moment; the king of the Killinoos, in the mean time, drawing his tomahawk, and preparing for battle. K 2 The Captain, who was reading at a front window, hearing the shout, looked about, and saw what going on at the woodpile. Stop villain, said he, to the king of the Killinoos; you are not to take that scalp yet, however much you may value it. He will not take an 100 dollars for it, nor 500, though you make him king of the Kickapoos, or any thing else. It is no trifling matter to have the ears slit in tatters, and the nose run through with a bodkin, and a goose quill stuck a cross; so that you may go about your business; you will get no king of the Kickapoos here. Under cover of this address of the Captain, Teague had retired to the kitchen, and ensconced himself behind the rampart of the maid. The Indian treaty-man, and the Killinoo chief, finding the measure hopeless, withdrew, and turned their attention, it is to be supposed, to some other quarter, to find a king of the Kickapoos. CHAP. III. Containing Observations. THE Captain was certainly to be commended in declining to countenance the imposition of making Teague a Kickapoo chief. Had he been disposed to adventure in a contraband trade of this kind, he might have undertaken it as a principal, and not as furnishing an assistant only. He could have passed Teague for a chief, and himself for an interpreter. He might pretend to have conducted this prince from a very distant nation, and that he had been several moons in travelling, and wanted, the Lord knows how much, goods for his people, that otherwise would come to war. By this means, the Captain would have taken the whole emolument of the treaty, and not have been put off with a small share of the profit which another made by it. I should like to have seen Teague in an Indian dress, come to treat with the commissioners. It would be necessary for him only to talk Irish, which he might pass for the Shawanee, or other language. The Captain could have interpreted in the usual words on these occasions. The policy of treating with the Indians is very good; because it takes off a great deal of loose merchandize, that might otherwise lie upon our hands, and cuts away superfluities from the finances of the government; at the same time, as every fresh treaty lays the foundation of a new war, it will serve to check the too rapid growth of the settlements. The extremities of a government, like the arm or ancle of an individual, are the parts at which blood is to be let. Struck with the good effects of treating with the savages, and that our wise men who conduct affairs, pursue the policy, I have been led to wonder, that the agricultural societies, have not proposed treaties with the wolves and bears, that they might not clandestinely invade our sheep and pig folds. This might be done by sending messages to the several ursine and vulpine nations, and calling them to a council fire, to which four or five hundred waggon load of beef should be sent, and distributed. If it should be said, that this would restrain them no longer from their prey than while they continued to be satiated, the same might be said of the Potawatamies, or other Indian nations; and yet we see that those at the head of our affairs think it prudent to negotiate with them. A bear and wolf treaty might seem an odd thing at first; but we should soon come to be accustomed to it. I should be sorry abuses should prevail, by treaty-making men passing rough water-dogs for bears, or mastiffs for wolves, upon our secretaries at war, or subordinate commissioners; which might be done as in the case of the savages, where it is pretended that some tribe that had not been at the general treaty, now sends a chief to represent them and to get goods. If our traders go amongst the wolves in consequence of a treaty, I could wish they could check themselves in the introduction of spirituous liquors. A drunk wolf, or bear, would be a dangerous animal. It may be thought, that a bear or wolf chief would not get drunk, as it would be setting a bad example to their people; but I have seen Indian kings lying on the earth drunk, and exposing their nakedness, like Noah to Shem, Ham, and Japheth; and if Indians that are a sort of human creature, act thus, what might we not expect from a poor brute wolf or bear. If treaties with the wolves and bears should be found to succeed, it might not be amiss to institute them also with the foxes. This is a sagacious animal, and particularly destructive to ducks and other fowls. It would be a great matter to settle a treaty with them, which might be done at the expence of nine or ten thousand dollars laid out in goods.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">BOOK VI. CHAP. I. MEANING to remain some time in a certain town to which he came, the Captain had his horse put out to pasture, and took private lodgings. The first day at dinner, he was struck with the appearance of a young man who sat at table, but could not be said to dine with them; for except a little water, and a bit of bread, he ate or drank nothing; and though sometimes addressed, he made no answer. There was a settled melancholy in his countenance, and he often sighed deeply. He had been in this house six weeks, and had behaved uniformly in the same manner. In the evening he would walk by himself till midnight. Whence he came, or what was his object, no one knew. He had bespoke a back room, and wished to have one where there was but little light; also, that a little water, and a bit of bread might be sent when he should require it. The landlady not chusing to have a person in the house who was unwilling to be seen, declined the circumstance of sending in provisions to his room; but thought it proper he should come to table. He did so; but entered into no conversation, tho' much pains was taken to engage him. He had paid his boarding regularly, and did not seem to be in want of money. This was the account given by the family, when the young man retired from dinner. The Captain's curiosity was much excited; for being a philanthropic man, he found himself interested in the history of this person. Taking an opportunity that very evening, when the young man was walking in the back porch, he joined him, and with the bluntness of a plain man, insisted to converse with him. Sir, said he, it is from no motive of vain curiosity, that I thus solicit. It is from a disposition to know and alleviate your griefs. For it is evident to me that something hangs heavy on your mind. I am a man, as you see, advanced in life, and have had some experience. It is possible it might be in my power to say or do something that might serve you; at least, it is my disposition to soothe your melancholy. If it should be an unfortunate murder, the guilt of which lies upon your mind, you will find no accuser in me; I shall preserve a secret obtained in this manner. Probably it might have been a duel, and with such alleviating circumstances, that though the law would take hold of it, humanity will excuse. The young man finding the charge of murder, or suspicion of it, ready to be fixed upon him, spoke. Said he, I am no murderer, but a murdered man myself. I am in love with a young woman of the most celestial beauty, but of a cruel heart. The beauty may be more in your brain than in her face, said the Captain; for, as the poet says, `There are three, the `children of imagination, the madman, `the lover, and the poet. The madman `sees more devils than vast hell can hold; `the lover, all as frantic, sees Helen's beau `ty in a brow of Egypt.' I am not unacquainted with the nature of this passion; and have seen a gypsey myself, in my time, L that have had dominion over me. Perhaps I may have been carried to as much extravagance as other people; and therefore am a proper person to advise against it. A principal source of my extravagance, was an opinion that the jade who had hold of my affections at the time, would pity me when she heard of the pain which her beauty gave me; that she would be afraid I would hang myself for her sake; that she would come to soothe and caress me, in order to prevent it. Far from it. My uneasiness was the proof of her power to wound; and the more distress I felt, the greater credit to her beauty. She would not have lost a sigh which she caused me for any consideration. My lamentations were as agreeable to her, as the groans of the damned are to the devil. And so it must be with every woman; because self love induces it. Hanging is the last thing they would be at. If they could get the lover brought to this, they are then at the height of fame. It falls but to the lot of one here and there to have a man drown himself for her; and when it does happen, it makes such a noise that all covet it. I would venture to say, that this female whom you fast and pray about so much, would be very unwilling to breathe the soul into you, were it once out. Instead of fasting, she is eating; and while you sigh in the night, she snores. You have an opinion, perhaps, that you may bend her by your perseverance. That is a mistake. A man that once comes to this state of sighing, and dying, has but little chance; because he has surrendered himself; and there is nothing more to be won. Were there any possibility of succeeding, it would be by first conquering yourself; dismissing all idea of her partiality for you; for it is owing to this secret vanity, and self-flattery, that you still pursue. Absolute despair is the first step towards the cure of love. It is either drowning or curing, with you at present. As you have not drowned yourself, you are in a fair way to be cured. I know very well how you missed the matter with this hussy. You appear to be a young man of great sensibility of feeling; and I presume made your addresses with great refinement of thought and manners. You talked to her of flames and darts, and flowers and roses; read poetry in the mean time, and thought a great deal of Phillis, and Amaryllis; and entertained her with names and incidents in romances, and sung and recited soft love songs about Amanda, and Phebe, and Colin; whereas your way was to have talked careless nonsense, and sung such songs as Pady Kelly, and Tristram Shandy-O; and told her stories of girls that had run off with pedlars, or gone a campaigning with the soldiers. These ideas are light and frolicsome, and co-natural to springing love. Hence it is that men of but loose and irregular education, succeed better with the fair, than scholars that are learned in the classics. But to bring the matter to a point, the true way is to get another mistress; and profit by your experience with the first. No more of sighing and dying in the case; but singing, and laughing, and jumping like a young fox. Hint a little with respect to certain matters that are between the sexes; but let it be done in so delicate a manner, that, though she understands you, she is not obliged to do it. What I mean, is to make her think you would rather debauch her than marry her. Bring her to this suspicion, and I warrant you. Her whole study will be to entrap you into matrimony. For it is natural for the human mind, when it observes a great security and confidence in another, to imagine there must be some ground for it. It will argue a consciousness, on your part, of having as good or better in your power. It will impress her with the same idea; and imagination governs the world. When the mind is bent upon any object, it is relieved by the conversation of those who understand it; and, as it were, dissolve with them in the same ideas. The young man was pleased with the conversation of the Captain, and seemed cheared; agreed to join the family, and be a little sociable. By degrees he became so; and what by the conversation of the Captain, sometimes explaining and sometimes ridiculing the passion of love; and the young ladies of the family, in the mean time, rallying him on his weakness, he came a little to his senses, (for love is a phrenzy), and began to behave like a common man. For it having come out now, that love was the cause of his distress and singularity of conduct, some pitied him, and others rallied it with good humour and philanthropy. It had, however, become the general topic in the family, and was carried down to the kitchen among the servants. L 2 Teague hearing of it took it into his head that he must be in love too; and counterfeiting a demure look, and absence of mind, and walking by himself, and living on spare diet, as he had heard the young man that was in love did, he wished to have it understood that his mind was under the dominion of the same passion. This being observed, was represented to the Captain; who being at a loss to know what was the matter, called Teague, and began to interrogate him. The bog-trotter, with some seeming reluctance, acknowledged that it was love. Said the Captain, You in love, you great bear; with whom are you in love? That dear cratur, said the Irishman, that has the black hair, and the fair face, and her name is Mrs. Sally, in the house there. She is a fair as the wool or the snow, and gives me the cholic, and the heart-burn, every time I look at her fair eyes; God save her soul from damnation, but I love her as I do the very food that I ate, or the cloathes that I ware upon my back. It appeared to be Miss Sally, a very pretty girl, the eldest daughter of the landlady; who, by the bye, I mean the ladlady, was a widow, and had two daughters and a niece with her; the handsomest of whom was this Miss Sally, with whom Teague had become enamoured. For simple and ignorant nature will fasten on beauty, as well as the most instructed in the principles of taste. The Captain having been a good deal troubled, heretofore, with the pretensions of this valet, in wishing to be a member of the legislature, a philosopher, a preacher, and now a lover, thought he had now a good opportunity of repressing his presumption for the future. There was a young man, a brother in the family, who had been some time in the service, as a lieutenant, and had leave of absence at this time, on a visit to his mother and sisters. The Captain well knew, that being in the pride and heat of youth, he would consider Teague's advances to his sister as an insult on the family, and chastise him accordingly. With this view, counterfeiting every possible disposition to serve the bog-trotter, the Captain recommended to him to make a confident of the brother, and endeavour to gain his interest with the sister. Accordingly, one morning when the officer was in his chamber, Teague made his approach; and composing his woe begone countenance as well as he could, and explaining the cause of it, solicited his interest with the lady. There was a whip in a corner of the room, with which the lieutenant had been riding; seizing this hastily, he made an attack upon the person of the lover, in a manner far beyond what was decent or moderate. The valet retreating with considerable outcries, made complaint to the Captain; who gave him to understand, that as this outrage was committed by his intended brother in-law, it must be considered in the nature of a family quarrel, and he could not interfere. The advances of Teague became the subject of conversation in the family, and of much mirth and laughter. The young man who had been in the state of melancholy before described, and had been cheered a little, was now in a great degree cured by the imitation of the valet. For ridicule is a better cure for love than passion. It is better to make the patient laugh than think. Having now a disposition to pursue his travels, the Captain sent for his horse, and set out. CHAP. III. Containing Observations. THE observations which we make when the narration of the fact is ended, are something like the sentiments delivered by the chorus in the ancient plays; a kind of moral on what was said; or like the moral as it is called to a fable. In this view therefore; we shall endeavour to say something. The young man that we have seen so deeply in love, was of a handsome personal appearance, and of an eye and physiognomy that indicated sensibility and understanding; and yet it is probable the female of whom he was so much enamoured, may have been both homely, and destitute of good mental qualities. Whence could a repulse in this case happen. From a thousand causes. We will specify some of them. The very circumstance of his being beyond her first hopes, may have put him beyond her last wishes. A female wooed by a man her superior, may be led to think she has still a chance for better; and that there must be diamonds in her hair, or some hidden advantages on her part, of which she was herself ignorant; otherwise such advances would not be made to her; or she may apprehend some defect on the part of the lover, of which he is conscious; otherwise, he would not stoop beneath his natural expectations. It is possible the Amanda may not have been of the same class and quality with himself. This would of itself account for the repulse. Should the eagle come from the firmament, and make his advances to the pheasant, he would find himself unsuccessful; for the brown bird would prefer a lover of her own species: or, should the rein deer, which is a most beautiful creature, woo a frog, the croaking animal would recede into the marsh, and solace itself with a paramour of its own chusing. When, therefore, unexperienced young persons place their affections on an object, and do not find a suitable return, they ought to save their pride, and make the inference, that they had descended from their element, and fastened on an animal unworthy of their notice. These observations, in addition to those made by the Captain to the young man, may be of use to unfortunate lovers; and if so, it will be a recompence for the trouble we have given ourselves in making them.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">BOOK VII. CHAP. I. IT was about an hour before sunset, that the Captain fell in company with one who had the Cincinnati eagle at his breast, and riding on together, put up at the inn. The landlady and the servants, having never seen the badge before, were a good deal struck with the effigy of the eagle, and the ribband at which it was pendant. Interrogating Teague, who had come in company, and whom they took to be a common servant to both, or at least acquainted with the affairs of either, what was the meaning of that bird, or what bird it was, that the gentleman had at his breast? Teague knew as little about it as they did; but unwilling to be thought ignorant, took upon him to inform them. It is, said he, a goose; and the maining is, that the shentleman would ate a goose, if your anours would get one roasted this avening, for his anour to ate with the Captain, who is my master; for we have ate nothing all day long, and a roasted goose with a shoulder of mutton, a pace of poark, and bafe and cabbage, and the like, would be a very good slake for a fasting stomach. So, God save your soul, dear honey, and make haste, and get a goose knocked down and put to the fire, to keep their anours from starving, and to go to bed in a good humour, when they have drank a cup of ale or a mug of cyder after the goose; and, bless your soul, dear honey, let it be a good large fat goose, that there may be a rib or a wing left, that a poor servant may have someting to ate, at the same time. The shentleman was very right to hold out a token, like the sign of a tavern-keeper, with a goose, or a pigeon, or a turkey, that paple may know what he wants, and not be after the trouble of asking whether he would chuse roast bafe and parates, or pork and parsnips, may it plase your anour. The landlady was a good deal distressed, M having no goose about the house. But sending out to her neighbours, she made shift to collect a couple of ducks, which Teague acknowledged would be a very good substitute. Supper being ordered, these were served up, with an apology from the landlady, that she had not been able to procure a goose; which she hoped the gentleman with the ribbon would excuse, as she was informed that a roasted goose was so much to his taste. A roasted goose to my taste! said the officer; what reason have you to think that a roasted goose is so much my choice? Surely madam you cannot mean wit, or to insinuate that I myself am a goose? for one animal preys not upon another; the maxim is, dog will not eat dog. I cannot therefore be a goose if I eat one. Here the landlady explained her meaning, giving the information she had received from the servant. The Captain was greatly irritated, and would have called him in and chastised him instantly, had not the officer interfered; declaring that though it was an eagle, not a goose that he wore at his breast, yet he was not dissatisfied at the mistake, in as much as it had brought a couple of good ducks to the table, a fowl of which he was particularly fond. This incident, in itself laughable, led the officer to relate the trouble he had had with a clergyman who had made a worse mistake than this, taking the eagle for a graven image, contrary to the injunction of the decalogue, which prohibits the making any such representation for the purpose of worship, as he alledged this to be. In answer to the clergyman, he had alledged the improbability that he who had been in the service so many years, at a distance from church, or church worship, except when a deistical chaplain came the way, should think so much of religion, as to have any worship at all; much less to have become superstitious, and to wear an image at his bosom. The truth was, that he worshipped any god, true or false, very little; at least, said few or no prayers, on such occasions; and was very far from being an idolater, and paying adoration to a gold or silver image; that this was nothing more than a hieroglyphic, being the effigies of a bald eagle, which is a native of America, and designates the cause for which her soldiery had fought; in the same manner as the eagle was the standard of the Roman legion; or the lion and the unicorn are the arms of England, or the thistle that of Scotland; that the emblem of the American bald eagle had, on these principles, been chosen by the Cincinnati for their badge; of which society he was a member, and wore this device, not venerating it as the image of any bird or beast whatsoever. The clergyman admitted, that, in strictness, this symbol might not be a graven image, as the term would intend engraving on wood or metal, with the point of an instrument; and under this mental reservation, the wearer might save himself in saying that it was not a graven image: but it was at least a molten one, which comes within the meaning of the prohibition; being the representation of a fowl, and doubtless for the purpose of idolatry. For what else could be the use or meaning of it. It was not a common broach, used as a ligament to the shirt or coat; and it was unworthy of a man to suppose it could be worn merely for ornament; boys and petit maitres delighting in these things, but no one else. It could not be any sort of time-piece, worn for the purpose of ascertaining distance. In fact, it was the portrait of a bird, the signal of some heathen deity; as the cock was sacred to Escalapius, the owl to Minerva, the peacock to Juno, and the dove to Venus. The eagle was sacred to Jupiter; and it was most probable, that it was in honour of this false god, that the image was worn. It answered no end to reason with the ecclesiastic; for he grew but the more enraged, and insisted that it was an idol; shewing from some texts of scripture, that in the last times idolaters were to spring up; and that this society, which the Cincinnati instituted, might be the Gog and Magog spoken of in the Apocalypse. Said the Captain, It was natural enough for the clergyman to make this deduction; as in maintaining the cause of truth against Pagans, he is led to dwell much on the subject of idolatry. But for my part, the principal objection that lies with me against your institution, is that which lies against all partial institutions whatsoever; they cut men from the common mass, and alienate their affections from the whole, concentring their attachments to a particular point and interest. A circumstance of this kind is unfavourable to general philanthropy, giving a temporary and artifical M 2 credit to those who are of the body, amongst themselves; so that while some lend character, others borrow; and the individuals do not stand on the natural basis of their own merit. On this principle, I do not much approve of clubs and societies, unless in the case of some humane or charitable institution; or for the purpose of carrying on some beneficial work or improvement. I do not know that in your conveening annually together, you have any object in view of this nature. I have not heard of any bridges you have built, or any canals dug, or locks made for the purpose of facilitating navigation. I do not see of what use your institution is; unless it be, that your pronouncing an oration now and then, may be favourable to eloquence. But of this I much doubt, as such abstract discourses usually degenerate into common place. The great object of an orator is, to persuade the judgment, or affect the passions. In this case, the judgment is already persuaded, the affections already gained. Having therefore, no object, what exertion can the mind make? Be the cause what it may, certain it is that such compositions are seldom or ever found to be models of eloquence; more especially where the subject is of an extensive nature, as the revolution of America, and the struggles of its heroes. For here so wide a canvass is spread, that it is difficult to fill it up; and to take a particular part would seem to be a dereliction of the rest; for which dereliction no special reason could be given. You could not embrace all the characters who have figured or have fallen, or catch at particular names of the illustrious. Consining yourself, therefore, to general observations, you make no particular impression, and your orations become frigid to the hearers. I have felt the truth of all this, said the Cincinnati gentleman, and the difficulty of composing an oration to satisfy my own wishes. For being appointed by the society to pronounce one at our next meeting, to which I am now on my way, I have been trying my hand at it, and find it as you say, very difficult; but have attributed this, not to the nature of the composition; but to the inferiority of my powers. Not so, said the Captain; for in the hands of the greatest masters, this kind of composition labours. We do not find that even the oration of Isocrates, on the Lacedemonian war, which he was ten years in composing, has obtained such celebrity among the ancients, as such great labour would bespeak. I have read the panegyric of Trajan, by Pliny; and find it but a cold composition. Plato's oration in honour of those who had fallen in the battles of Marathon and Platea, is the best of this kind that antiquity can produce, and doubtless has great excellence of simplicity of painting. The touches are delicate and fine, and I do not know but we may place it among the most beautiful productions. It amuses with magic wildness of fancy, at the same time, restrained and guided by an exquisite judgment. But it is rather a poem than an harangue. For though the composition is in prose, yet it breathes the soul of a bard, and is inchanting by the flow of the words, and the elevation of the images. In modern times, the best thing we have of this nature, is the panegyric of Cromwell, supposed to be written by the great Milton, but not delivered. The ingenuity discovered in the mode of praising him, deserves every possible commendation. But the greater part of addresses that I have seen to great men now-a-days, or orations on public occasions, are turgid, or jejune, or little worth our notice. After this, said the Cincinnati gentleman, I shall hesitate to show you the essay I have made towards a composition of this nature, as you appear to be so good a judge in this respect, and to know the deficiencies that may appear in any effort of this kind. Nay, rather, said the Captain, you ought to be the more confident in so doing; for knowing the difficulty of the work, I shall be the more ready to excuse what comes short of perfection. I shall then take the liberty, said the Cincinnati gentleman, to read you a few paragraphs. I shall be happy to hear it, said the Captain. The Cincinnati gentleman read as follows: Compatriots—I wish to say those things that never have been said, and that never will be said again. Because, in this case, there will be the characteristics of novelty and singularity; the two great constituents of pleasure, in all intellectual entertainments. But what can I say new? Has not the whole world resounded with the justness of the cause in which we have been engaged; with the greatness of the attempt to withstand the power of Britain? And have not we, ourselves, felt, seen, and known the great variety and change of good or bad fortune? What will it contribute to our immediate enjoyment to go over such scenes, unless the particular achievements of each officer can be enumerated, which decency forbids, and which indeed, cannot be done in the limits of one harangue. Leaving, therefore, ourselves, and these scenes, wholly out of the question, let us speak a little of those whom we left behind. But why need we speak; for all time will speak of them. The bards that shall live, will draw hence their choicest allusions. Consider them, indeed, as more happy than you, because they ascended from among the group of their companions, who were at that time instant witnesses of their achievments. The warriors who fall in battle, are the most glorious subjects of panegyric. Hector and Achilles, form the most splendid part of the song of Homer, and in a great degree, because their bodies were interred in the presence of the two armies. Oh what a noble object! an army mourning a brave officer, and tears drawn even from the foe, struck with the sublime of his personal prowess, and excellent knowledge of the military art. Much unlike, and far above those who languish with sickness on a bed in calm life, where relations standing round, wish the departure of the shade, and gape for the possession which he leaves behind. But the fame of a soldier none but himself can enjoy, there can be no heir or devisee of his property. It is his own, and it mounts with him. His blood only remains to bless the earth, from which flowers and roses spring, and clothe the woods and groves with enchantment and delight. For here the song of poesy is awakened, and at morn, and noon, and at still eve, they are heard who rehearse where the brave fell, and where they sleep. Sublime spirits! whether you inhabit the Pagan elysium or the Christian heaven, you are happy; and listen to those immortal lyres which are strung to the deeds of heroes. So much for the exordium of the oration; it was all he had yet written. The evening passed away in hilarity; and the conversation turned again on the Cincinnati order; but particularly what may be called the arms of the institution, viz. Britannia represented as a fine woman, with her bosom bare, affrighted; and Cincinnatus, an accoutred knight, attacking her thus unarmed, as St. George did the dragon; the eagle, the bird of Jove, in the mean time grasping the lightning in his claws, an image that would seem unnatural: Whereas the eagle might be represented in the clouds near Jove, where the lightning might be left to work its forked course, without the handing of the eagle; and in the other figure, Cincinnatus might raise his lance against the lion that supports the crown, not against the goddess of the island. From these strictures which the Captain, without pretending to be a connoisseur, made, the transition was easy to a criticism on the motto of the badge; viz. Omnia reliquit, servare, rempublicam. The infinitive is here used instead of the gerund, with the preposition, ad servandam; as if it was intended to express his motion, or change of place, and not the object. But in fact, the motto does not at all express that in which the merit of Cincinnatus did consist. It was not in his leaving every thing to accept the commission of the Roman senate; but in resigning his commission, and, the work done, going to his plough again. His praise would have been expressed better by the phrase of, Victor ad aratrum redit. In fact, it cannot apply well to our army; most of our officers not having much to leave when they accepted their commissions; but discovered a Cincinnati-like disposition, in returning after war to the employments of civil life. It is true, there would have been less tinsel, and more bullion, in the patriotism of retiring without a badge, as Cincinnatus did: But it is a thing that can do little harm, and it is pleasing to indulge a whim. It may doubtless be said, that there were officers that left the plough, and fought, and returned to it, as well as those who are within the limitations of the institution, and entitled to a badge; that, troops who had served a short enlistment, and militia persons, at least those who fought a little, were not wholly destitute of some claim to the badge of merit. Even those who lost property might be said to suffer, and advance pretensions to the reward of honour. Not that all of them should claim gold medals, or even silver; but some brass, some copper, pewter, a bit of tin, or pot metal, just as the specific value of their services might entitle them. Perhaps while some wore it at the breast, others N might be enjoined to war it at the breeches pocket, and thus, as well by the point from which appendant, as by the bob itself, designate the proportion of their honour. After this, some things were said on the subject of introducing honourary members; against which the Captain declared himself: That every thing ought to be preserved sui generis; as nature makes no honourary animals; but all are of the species, or take not the name: a bear is a real bear, a sheep is a sheep; and there is no commixture of name, where there is a difference of nature. But it did not appear to be of any great consequence, one way or the other. For the order would never come to any great head, as there was no opposition given. For this is necessary to keep alive attachment to what is arbitrary, and founded, not in utility, but caprice. For as the fire dies without air, so whim without contradiction. The officer was a man of liberality and good sense, and acknowledged the truth of this. But the evening being now far spent, candles were called for, and they went to bed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">POSTSCRIPT. THE preceding pages were written several years ago; during which time the Captain has continued his travels: and having been favoured with his journal, I have occasionally made extracts, and put them in the form of a continued history. Whether I shall publish any more, will depend on the reception of this. I had first begun this work in verse, and have a volume by me, about two parts in three as large as Butler's Hudibrass; from which composition, I have extracted this; thinking it might be more acceptable in prose. When I visit this city next, I may produce that in verse, and let the people take their choice. It is a happiness to a man to be able to amuse himself with writing. For it is not every one that can play upon the violin, or the flute; and the fingers must be employed some way. I may be blamed in not chusing some subject worthier of my studies, and requiring a profound research. It might profit the world more; but it would amuse myself less. Omnis labor improbus; all toil is grievous. However, I have not been wholly inattentive to severer studies. I have several law tracts by me; for which I mean, in due time, to solicit a subscription. Nonum prematur in annum, in every work of moment, ought to be observed. There are some light things which I may in the mean time throw out; a comparison of Thucydides with Livy; thoughts on the Egyptian hieroglyphics; on the Carthaginian commerce; a comparison of the French and English eloquence; a supplement to Buffon, containing a description of several genera of animals, not taken notice of by him; hints for the improvement of the microscope; on the use of the Masoretic points; on the recent origin of the earth; on the criminal code of the Siamese, &amp;c. If the world will excuse these, I will give them my word for it, they shall be troubled little more; for except the examining my law tracts, I shall drop my pen, finding it, as I advance in life, more adviseable to apply myself to making money. What things have been written, and are now lying by me, may occasionally see the light. It is a good deal owing to my solitary residence in the western country, at a distance from books and literary conversation, that I have been led to write at all. It was necessary to fill up the interstices of business. If I should remain in that country, the same circumstances may lead me to write still. If I should remove to this city, or the seat of the federal government, I shall avoid the tedium by other means. I wish the present book, to sell for at least as much as will defray the expence of printing; for I have no inclination to lose by it. If I had a little time to stay in town, I could give it some celebrity by extracts, and remarks upon it; publishing for and against. For it is of no consequence how a book is made famous, provided that it is famous. The truth is, as I have said, I value this book for little but the stile. This I have formed on the model of Xenophen, and Swift's Tale of a Tub, and Gulliver's Travels. It is simple, natural, various, and forcible. I hope to see it made a school book; a kind of classic of the English language. In looking over it, I find in the whole work, but one word I would alter; it is near the beginning; where I say figure on the stage, instead of appear, or make a figure on the stage. I have carefully avoided the word unfounded instead of groundless, a word in vogue, among members of Congress especially. The word commit, is good, but being lately introduced, and too much hackneyed, I have not used it. Language being the vestment of thought, it comes within the rules of other dress; so that as slovenliness, on the one hand, or foppery, on the other, is to be avoided in our attire; so also in our speech, and writing. Simplicity in the one and the other, is the greatest beauty. We do not know at what time the Greek language began to be written as it was by Hesiod or Homer. But we find it to have continued with little or no change, from that time to the latest writers among the Byzantine historians, a period of more than 3000 years. The Roman language is considered as improving from the time of Ennius to the Augustine age. The language of the orators, poets, and historians of that time is the standard. It was not so much in the use of particular words, as an affectation in the thought, that Seneca is censured as corrupting the language of the Romans. But Tacitus, after him, writes in a pure stile; and I have found but one conceit in expression, in his whole history: meaning to give the geography of a country of a certain tribe of the Germans; they are, says he, separated from the Sequani by mount Jura, from the — by the lake —, from the — by the river —, and from the Atabani by mutual fear. I do not find so much fault with the stile of Pliny, as the heaviness of his thoughts and expressions. However, the Latin stile of writing retained its propriety and other excellencies tolerably well, till the monks got possession of it, and brought it down to a jargon that is now exploded; and we recur to the pure originals of Horace, Virgil, Cicero, and Sallust. The French language is corrupting fast; and not in the use of words, but in the affectation of surprise, in the structure of the sentence, or the turn of the expression. Mirabeau was free from this; but not the Abbe Raynal. To give an example: meaning to say, which he might have done in a simple manner, that about this time the English cast their eyes upon Goa, as a place where, &amp;c. stating the advantages of such a port; he begins by telling you, that the English had occasion for such a port, which, &amp;c. enumerating the advantages; and after this, with surprize comes upon you, and tells you, they wanted Goa. Enfin, says he; that is, in fine they wanted Goa. The English language is undoubtedly written better in America than in England, especially since the time of that literary dunce, Samuel Johnson, who was totally destitute of taste for the vrai naturalle, or simplicity of nature. The language of the Scots writers is chaste, but the structure of the sentence of the academic Dr. Robertson, especially offends in this particular; his uniformity of period striking the ear with the same pulse, as the couplets of our rhyme in Dryden and Pope. Hume is before him in this respect, writing as naturally as a man speaks; his stile rising and falling with the subject, as the movements of the mind themselves. I am quite out of patience with this postscript. I have written it, the Printer informing me that he had a few pages of the last sheet to fill, which must be left blank unless I had something more; but as I am in a hurry about some small matters, and have no disposition to write, I believe I shall conclude, and let him leave the remainder blank, or put in a paragraph of his own, if he chuses it. It just strikes me to add, that I am this moment come from being admitted a Counsellor in the supreme court of the United States; having written the preceding part of this postscript just before the court sat. In consequence of my admission in this honourable court, I feel myself inspired with a consciousness of new dignity, and am determined to relinquish the indulgence of all these light amusements, and apply myself for the future to fathom the profound depths of the legal oceans and rivers.

      <field name="fulltext">Modern Chivalry: CONTAINING THE ADVENTURES OF Captain John Farrago, AND TEAGUE O'REGAN, HIS SERVANT. VOLUME II. By H. H. BRACKENRIDGE. Quicquid agunt homines, nostri, farrago libelli. Juvenal. PHILADELPHIA: Printed and sold by John M`Culloch, No. 1, North Third-street. M.DCC.XII. [Entered according to Act of Congress.]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Vol. II. A BOOK I. CHAP. I. RISING early next morning, the Captain proceeded, with his man Teague, on his journey, and having breakfasted at an inn, where nothing material happened, we shall pass it over, and come as far down in the day as eleven o'clock; tho', by the bye, it might have been more correct to have said up in the day, because the sun rises until twelve o'clock, and then descends: But waving this nicety, we shall go on to relate what actually took place. A man was seen before them, driving, leisurely, a horse with two kegs upon his back. The Captain took him for what is called a pack-horse man, that was carrying salt or sugar to some place of market. A man of a philosophic turn of mind never hesitates to enter into conversation with any character; because human nature is the field whence he gathers thoughts and expressions. The Captain therefore accosting this man, said, Is it salt or molasses you have in your kegs, countryman? You are going home from some store, I suppose, where you have purchased; or going to set up a small store of your own, and vend goods. No, said the man, with a Scotch-Irish pronunciation, there is an election this day a little way before us, and I am setting up for the legislature, and have these two kegs of whisky to give a dram to the voters. The Captain was thrown into a reverie of thought, and began to reflect with himself on the nature of a republican government, where canvassing by such means as this, can work so great an evil as to elevate the most unqualified persons to the highest deliberative assemblies. But, in the mean time, roused a little from his thought, he had presence of mind to recollect the danger in which he was about to be involved afresh with his man Teague; whom, now looking round, he saw to be about forty yards behind him. It would have been adviseable to have diverted from the road, and taken a circuitous rout, to avoid the election ground. But as the devil, or some worse being, would have it, it was a lane in which they were, with a fence on each side; so that he could not divert without leaping like a fox hunter, or one of your light-horse men, to which the sober nag on which he rode was not competent. Besides, if Teague did not leap after him he would be left exposed in the lane to the populace, who might solicit him to be their representative. To turn directly back would appear indecorous, and unless he could drive Teague on before him, which was not customary, and to which he might not, all at once submit, his station would of course be the rear, where he might be picked up as a straggler, and sent to some public body. In this quandary of thought, looking up, he saw the breakers just a-head; that is, the people met for the purpose of electing, and that it was now impossible to avoid them. Depending, therefore, on his own address, to make the best of circumstances, he suffered himself to be carried along towards them, keeping, in the mean time, an eye upon Teague, who was the cause of his concern. Meeting accidentally with a Scotch gentleman on the ground, whom he knew, he communicated to him the delicacy of his situation, and the apprehensions he had on the part of Teague. Said the Scotch gentleman, Ye need na gie your sel any trouble on that head, man; for I sal warrant the man wi the twa kegs will carry the elaction: there is na resisting guid liquor; it has an unco effec on the judgment in the choice of a representative. The man that has a distillery or twa in our country, canna want suffrages. He has his votaries about him like ane o' the Heathen gods, and because the fluid exhilerates the brain, they think he maun be a deity that makes it; and they fa' down, especially when they have drank ower muckle, and worship him, just as at the shrine of Apollo or Bacchus, among the ancients. The candidate that opposed the man of the two kegs, was a person of gravity and years, and said to be of good sense and experience in facts. The judgment of the people was in his favour, but their appetite leaned against him. There is a story of one Manlius, a Roman, A 2 who had saved the capitol from the Gauls, by putting his breast to the rampart, and throwing them down as they ascended. When this man afterwards, elated with the honours paid him, forgot the duties of a citizen, wishing to subvert the republic, by usurping the power of a tyrant, the people, jealous of liberty, were incensed; and being convicted of the crime, he was dragged to punishment. It was not the way, at that time, to hang, as you would a dog; or behead, as you would a wild beast: but to throw from a high rock, which they called the Tarpeian. The capitol was just in view, and while they were dragging him along to the place, he would stretch his hand to this; as much as to say, There, O Romans, I saved you: The populace at this would stop a while, irresolute whether to desist or drag him on. While they recollected his offence, they marched a step; but when they cast their eye on the capitol, they stood still; and not until some principal men directed the rout out of the view of the capitol, could he be brought to justice. So it was with the multitude convened on this occasion, between the man with the two kegs and the grave looking person. When they looked on the one, they felt an inclination to promote him. But when again on the other hand, they saw two kegs which they knew to be replenished with a very chearing liquor, they seemed to be inclined in favour of the other. But appetite prevailed, and they gave their votes in favour of the man with the two kegs. Teague in the mean time thinking he had another chance of being a great man, had been busy, but to no purpose; for the people gave their votes to the man of the two kegs. The Captain thought himself fortunate to be thus relieved, and proceeded on his journey. CHAP. II. Containing Observations. THE perplexity of the Captain, in the late transaction on account of his man servant, may serve to put those in mind who travel with a waiter, not to go much about at the election seasons, but avoid them as you would the equinoxes. It might not be amiss, if, for this reason the times of electing members for the several bodies were put down in the almanac, that a man might be safe in his excursions, and not have an understrapper picked up when he could not well spare him. I mean this as no burlesque on the present generation; for mankind in all ages have had the same propensity to magnify what was small, and elevate the low. We do not find that the Egyptians, though there were lions in the kingdom of Lybia, not far distant, ever made a god of one of them. They rather chose the cow kind, the stork, and the crocodile, or the musk-rat, or miresnipe, or other inferior animal to deify. The Romans, and the Greeks also, often worshipped small matters. Indeed we do not find amongst any nation, that the elephant, or rhinoceros, or elk, or unicorn, have been made tutelar divinities. As, Cannons shoot the higher pitches, The lower you put down their breeches. The smaller the objects we take up, and make them great, the act is the greater; for it requires an equal art in the formation of the glass to magnify, as to diminish, and if the object is not of itself small, there is no magnifying. Caligula is celebrated through all history for making his horse a senator. It would have been nothing to have made a Roman knight one; but to endow a mere quadruped with the qualities of a legislator, bespeaks great strength of parts and judgment. CHAP. III. IT was about three o'clock in the afternoon that the Captain came to an inn, where unhorseing and unsaddling, Teague took the steed, and the master went to sleep on a sopha in the passage. Unless it is in a very deep sleep, the mind is in some degree awake, and has what are called dreams. These are frequently composed of a recollection of late events. Sometimes the mind recovers incidents long since past, and makes comments, but most usually, out of mere indolence takes up with what is next at hand. It happened so on this occasion; for the Captain thought himself still engaged with the Scotchman on the subject of the late election. It seemed to him that he said, Mr. M`Donald, for that was the name of the Scotch gentleman, you do not seem to have a high opinion of our republican form of government, when the most indifferent can obtain the people's suffrages. The Scotchman seemed to answer in his own dialect, saying, Ye are much mistaken man, if ye draw that conclusion. I think there is a worse chance for merit to come forth where appointments are in the hand of one than when with many; for it is much easier to scratch the rump of one, than tickle the hurdies o' a thousand. Ye see our executives dinna do much better in their appointments to judicial and ministerial offices, than the rabble folk themselves to the legislative. It all comes to the same thing in every government; the wind blaws, and the feathers and the fern get uppermost. At this instant he was awakened by a bustle out of doors. The fact was; a disagreement had taken place between Teague and the hostler at the inn, about their skill respectively in rubbing down and currying horses. Teague had made use of a single grab of hay, which he held with both hands, and impressed the horse, rubbing him from side to side, and up and down with all his might. The other with a wisp in each hand, rubbed; the right hand passing to the left, while the left hand passed to the right, in a transverse or diagonal direction. The hostler valued himself on having been groom, as he pretended, to some nobleman in England, and therefore most be supposed to understand the true art of currying. Teague maintained his opinion, and way of working with a good deal of obstinacy, until at last it came to blows. The first stroke was given by Teague, who hit the hostler on the left haunch with his foot, when he was stooping down to shew Teague how to rub the fetlock. The hostler recovering, and seizing Teague by the breast, pushed him back with a retrograde motion, until he was brought up by a cheek of the stable door. Resting against this, Teague made a sally, and impelled his antagonist several yards back, who finding at length behind him the support of a standing trough where the waggoners used to feed, recovered his position, and elanced Teague some distance from the place of projection. But Teague still keeping hold of the collar of his adversary, had brought him along with him, and both were now on the ground struggling for victory. But Teague turning on his belly, and drawing up his knees, was making an effort to raise himself to his feet. The other in the mean time, partly by the same means, and partly by retaining hold of the Irishman, was in the attitude of rising with him. They were now both up, locked fast in the grasp of each other, their heads inclining in conjunction, but their feet apart, like muskets stacked after a review, or like the arch of a bridge. The head of each supported by the abutment of the feet. Few blows were given, and therefore not much damage done. But the persons present calling out fair play, and making a bustle in the porch of the inn, had awakened the Captain, and bro't him to the door, who seeing what was going on, took upon him to command the peace; and the people supposing him to be a magistrate, assisted to part the combatants; when the Captain ordering both of them before him, made enquiry into the cause of the dispute. Teague gave his account of the matter; adding, if he had had a shillelah, he would have been after making him know that the paple in dis country, could curry a horse, or a cow, or a shape, as well as any Englishman in de world, though he have been hastler to a great lord, or de king himself, at his own stable where he has his harse. Teague, said the Captain, this may be true; but it was unbecoming a philosopher to attempt to establish this by blows. Vol. II. B Force proves nothing but the quantum of the force. Reason is the only argument that belongs to man. You have been the aggressor, and therefore in the power of the law. But as to you, Mr. Hostler, you have given considerable provocation. I have had this lad with me several years, and I say that he curries and rubs down a horse very well. It is no uncommon thing for men of your country, to undervalue other nations, or those retained by them. You naturally associate your own attainments with the bulk and populousness of your cities: But can the looking at a large building, or a tall spire, add an inch to your stature? Because Fox is eloquent, is every one that hears him so too? Is not human ingenuity, the same here as on the other side of the water? Our generals have fought as well, in the late war, as any Clinton, or Cornwallis that you have. Our politicians have wrote, and our patriots have spoke as well as your Burkes, or your Sheridans, or any other; and yet when you come here, there is no bearing the airs of superiority you take upon yourselves. I wonder if the wasps, that are in your garrets in London, consider themselves better than the wasps that are in these woods? I should suppose they must; such is the contemptible vanity of an island, which, taking in its whole extent, would be little more than a urinal to one of our Patagonians in South America. This the Captain said to mortify the hostler; though, by the bye, there is a good deal of truth in the observation, that the people of an old country undervalue the new; and when they think of themselves, conjoin the adventitious circumstances of all that exists where they have lived. I have found a prejudice of this nature even with the wisest men. What wonder, therefore, that a poor illiterate hostler should be subject to it? But if he did undervalue an American born, yet he ought to have considered that Teague, though not born in Britain, was born near it, and therefore might considerably approach the same skill in any handy-craft work. In natural history, we do not value animals on account of the place from whence they are taken, but on account of what they are themselves; and in things that are made by hands, not by the manufacturer, but the quality. We prefer the trout of the rivulet, to the mullet of the river; and we judge of the pudding not by the maker, but the eating. There is a proverb that establishes this; for proverbs are the deductions of experience, and to which we assent as soon as expressed; containing in them an obvious truth, which the simplest understand. CHAP. IV. IT is not for the sake of any moral, that I have related this scuffle that took place between the Irishman and the hostler; but for the sake of shewing in what manner incidents are to be related; that is, with great simplicity of stile, and minuteness of description. That part of Livy which contains the combat of the Horatii, and Curatii, is frequently given to the students at a college to translate, that by this means they may be taught to imitate the like delicacy in the choice of words, and particularity of the recital. The above may answer the same purpose. It is true there is not the like incidents in this combat, as in that described by Livy; nevertheless, the same art is therein discovered, as the sound critic will observe. I know it will be thought by any one who reads it, that he could use the very same words, and give the same liveliness of picture, were B 2 he to attempt it. Should he try it, he will find himself disappointed.——Sudet multum, frustraque laboret, ausus idem.— It may be thought, that though stile is my object, yet I might now and then bring along a thought to entertain the reader, and introduce some subject of moment, rather than the fisty-cuffs of two raggamuffins. I would just ask this question; Is not the talent of the artist shewn as much in painting a fly, as a waggon-wheel. If this were intended as a book of morals, or physiology, and not as a mere belles lettres composition, there might be something said;—as the case is, critics must be silent.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">BOOK II. CHAP. I. I SHALL pass over the circumstances of the Captain's dining, and Teague, reconciled with the hostler, taking his mess in the kitchen; and go on to what befel afterwards, when having saddled the horse, they set out on their further perigrination. Towards evening, when the shadows of the trees began to be very long, the Captain bidding Teague trot along side, addressed him in the following words:— Teague, said he, it is true I am none of your knight-errants, who used to ride about the world relieving fair damsels, and killing giants, and lying out in woods, and forests, without a house, or even fore?ts"&gt;forests, without a house, or even tent-cloth over their heads, to protect them from the night air. Nevertheless, as in some respects my equipment, and sallying forth resembles a knight-errant, and you a squire, would it be amiss, just for a frolick, to ly out a night or two, that it might be said that we have done the like. There is no great danger of wolves or bears, for while there are sheep, or pigs to be got at, they will shun human flesh. It will make a good chapter in our journal, to describe you lying at the foot of an oak tree, and me with my head upon my saddle, under another; the horse, in the mean time, feeding at a small distance. Teague thought it would be an easier matter to write down the chapter in the journal, than ly under the trees to beget it. It is true, said the Captain, navigators and travellers, make many a fiction; and those who have been in battle have killed many, that were killed by others, or have not been killed at all. But it would ill become a limb of chivalry to deviate from the truth. It will be but about twelve hours service lying on our backs and looking up to the stars, hearing the howling of wolves, and observing the great bear in the heavens, the means by which the Chaldeans, the first astronomers, laid the foundation of the science. Fait, and I tink, said Teague, it would be better to be in a good house, with a shoulder of mutton to ate before we go to slape, than to have our own shoulders tarn by the bears, or brused by lying under great oaks. Of what use is this astranomy? did any of these astranamers ever shoot down a bear in the firmament, to get a joint of mate for a sick person; and what good comes of lying in de woods, to be ate up by the snakes; but severs, and agues, and sore troats, to get a long cough, and die in a ditch like a dead horse, and be nothing thought of, but be trown into ridicule like a black-head that has no sense. It is better to go to a house and get a bed to slape in, and warm shates about us, than be lying in the dew like a frag, crocking the next day like one of dase, and get no good by it. The Captain had made the proposition merely to divert himself with Teague, and so did not insist upon it. Riding one or two miles, the sun was setting, and a house appeared in view a little off the road. A lane led up to it with a meadow on one side, and a pasture field on the other. On this last, there were cattle of cows, and sheep grazing. The house in front, was a frame building, respectable in appearance, from the height, and dimensions, but ancient. There was a considerable extent of clear ground around it, and an orchard hard by, with at least five hundred apple-trees. Having lodged chiefly at inns since his first setting out, the Captain had the curiosity to diversify his travels, by lodging at a private house this evening. Accordingly riding up to the door, and calling out Halloa, which is the note of interrogation which is used when a man wishes the master or mistress of a family, or some one of the servants, to come forth, to know what he wants. It happened that the mistress herself came to the door, and seeing a good looking man, in a green old age, sitting on horse-back, with his servant ready to take care of his steed should he think proper to dismount, she made a low curtsey, as much as to say, Sir, I should be happy to know, in what manner I can serve you. Madam, said the Captain, to tell you the truth, the night is drawing on, and I have been reflecting with myself, whether to lodge in the woods, or take a house. All things considered, I have thought it most adviseable to take a house, and the only question that now remains is, whether I can get one. The lady smiling with much complacency, and inclining her head forward, and her middle back, replied, I should be happy, Sir, if this small mansion could afford you an accomodation worthy of your suite. Madam, said the Captain, I shall be happy if the guest can be worthy of the accommodation. Alight, Sir, said the lady, we shall be happy to receive you. Having alighted, he was introduced to a very decent apartment, where the lady seating herself in a large cushioned chair, and pulling out her box, took a pinch of snuff, and laid the box upon the cushion. She was a good looking woman, being about fifty-seven years of age, with gray hairs, but a green fillet on her left eye-brow, as it seems the eye on that side was subject to a defluction of rheum, which made it expedient to-cover it. It could not be said that her teeth were bad, because she had none. If she wanted the rose on her cheek, she had it on her nose, so that it all came to the same thing. Nothing could be said against her chin, but it used her mouth ill in getting above it. She was not very tall, but what she wanted in height, she made up in breadth; so that multiplying one dimension by the other, she might be considered as a very sizeable woman. After conversing a little while, the lady withdrew, to give directions in the kitchen what to provide for supper. The Captain in the mean time taking up a pipe, which he saw on the mantlepiece, amused himself with a whiff. The old lady in the mean time was in the kitchen, and the first thing she observed was Teague, reclining in an angle of the chimney fast asleep. Considering him inattentive to his master's horse which had been sent to the stable, she desired a servant to give him a jog, and wake him. Teague, awaking, saw the old lady, and bespoke her. Dear madam, what a great happiness it is for poor sharvants to have gentle folks about them? God bless your anours ladyship; you are just for all the world like my cousin Shala Shagney, the honsomest woman in all Ireland, and was married to Shan Crossan, who had a great estate, and a flock of shape into the bargain. She used to say to me when I was aslape, Teague are you awake; and when I was awake, Teague are you aslape, dear honey. There is something in an Irishman which has an admirable effect upon the fair; whether it is owing to that love creating lustiness of person, and freshness of complexion which they usually possess; or the delicacy and quantum of the flattery of which they are not niggardly; nor need they be so, no persons having a greater stock to come and go upon. For so it was, that the language of the bog trotter, had gained the good will of this same Hecuba, and she ordered him a tankard of metheglim, to make himself merry with the servants. Returning to the parlour she continued her conversation with the Captain; but her mind running upon Teague she could not avoid introducing his name, with a view to learn some particulars of his history. This is a civil young man, said she, that came with you, and of a conversation above ordinary persons. The Captain being an observer of the passions of the mind, as they express themselves in the eye and aspect, saw that Teague had made some impression on the affections of this goodly old maiden gentlewoman: Nor was he displeased with it; for his first alarm was, that she would have fastened on himself; but her passion taking this Vol. II. C course, would be less troublesome. Framing his answers therefore to her questions, with a view to favour what had so fortunately commenced, he gave her to understand, that, though in the disguise of a servant, Teague was no inconsiderable personage; that he had been a member of Congress one or two years; though, by the bye, this was stretching the matter a little, as he had only had it in his power to be one. But if it is allowable to strain a point at all, it is in the recommendation of one who stands well enough already; for not being taken on the recommendation, there is no deception; and it is but civility to make one more pleased with their choice, than they already are. The Captain said nothing of his having preached, or being about to preach; for the idea of sermons, and catechisms, impressing the mind with religious awe, is unfavourable to love. As to his being a member of the philosophical society, it could be neither here nor there with a lady, and therefore he was silent with respect to this also. Supper being brought in, they sat down; but little conversation passed; the mind of the enamorata being more in the kitchen than in the parlour. After supper, the Captain sitting sometime, and seeming drowsy, was asked by his hostess, if he chose to go to bed: Answering in the affirmative, a servant waited with a candle; and bidding her good night, he was lighted to his chamber. No sooner had he withdrawn, but the old lady sent her compliments to Teague, to take a seat in the parlour; where sitting down to a roasted duck, just brought in, a few slices of gammon on a plate, a piece of veal, and a couple of roasted potatoes, he was desired to partake: the old lady casting amourous looks at him, in the mean time. I say looks; for though she had but one eye to look with, yet looking often, she might be said to cast looks. It was a new thing to the Irishman, to be at a table with a servant at his back; and he began now to think that fortune meant to do him justice: and with an ease, and self-possession, which some would call affrontery, he did the honours of the table; helping himself, and talking as fast as consisted with his disposition to satisfy his appetite. May it please your ladyship, said he, I am a poor sharvant now, but I have seen the time, when I have ate at as good a table as the Captain my master, though he rides upon a horse and I trot on foot. My uncle, by the mother's side, Shan O'Gan, had a deer park, and kept race-horses, to go to de fair, and the city of Cork; and my father's brother, Phelim O'Regan, was a justice of the pace, and hung paple for staleing shape. I might have been a member of parliament, if I had staid at home and went to school; but sending a challenge, and fighting wid my own dear cousin Denis O'Conelly, I had to fly de kingdom, and brought noting wid me but my brogs, and ten guineas in my purse; and am now noting but a poor sharvant, unless your ladyship would take pity upon me, and marry me; for I am wary of this way of tratting after a crazy Captain, that has no sense to curry his own harse; and I have to fight duels for him, and keep him from being knocked down like a brute baste; for dis very day, when he had a quarrel wid a hastler, and was trown upon his back, I lifted him up, and said, Dear honey, are you dead? took de hastler by de troat, and choaked him, and he could not spake, but said, Dear shentlemen, spare my life; so dat if your ladyship will take me to yourself, I will stay wid you, and take care of de harses, and cows, and de shape, and plant parates, and slape wid you, and ask not a farthing, but your own sweat self into de bargain; for you are de beauty of de world; and fasting or slaping, I could take you to my arms, dear crature, and be happy wid you. The lady was by this time entirely won, and gave him to understand, that in the morning, after consulting a friend or two, the marriage might be celebrated. I give only a sketch of the courtship that took place, for a great deal was said; and it was near midnight before the lovers could prevail upon themselves to part; when Teague was lighted to his bed, and had as good as that in which the Captain slept, which was a new thing to him; being accustomed to pig in with hostlers and servants, at the places where they lodged. The Captain was up early in the morning, and astonished not to find Teague stiring, but enquiring of the servants where Teague slept, he was shewn up a pair of stairs, which he ascended, thinking he had one or two more to ascend before he reached the garret. But what was his astonishment, C 2 when he was shewn into a room on the second floor, where he found Teague snoring on a feather bed with curtains. Waking him, Teague; said he, this goes beyond all your former impudence; to crawl up out of the kitchen, and get into a feather bed. Please your anour, said Teague, to ring a bell, and call up a sharvant, to bring boots, and slippers; for I am to be married dis marning. The Captain was thunder-struck; and comprehending the whole of what had taken place, saw his faux pas in recommending him to the hostess; and now it only remained, to cure the blunder he had made, if it was at all curable. We are short sighted mortals; and while we stop one leak, the water rushes in at another. The very means that we use to save ourselves from one evil, leads us to a worse. The Captain had need on this occasion of all his address. Composing himself, he dissembled, and spoke as follows: Teague, said he, will you that are a young man, and have great prospects before you, consign yourself to the arms of an old woman. Her breath will kill you in the course of a fortnight. The fact is, she is a witch, and inchantress; she made the same proposition to me last night, of marrying me; but I declined it. The world is full of these sort of cattle. There was one Shagnesa Circe, in old times, that used to gather all she could into her net, and transform them into hogs. Sir Teague Ulysses was the only one that had the sense to keep clear of her music, and avoid her. Did you see that drove of hogs before the door, when we rode up last evening. They are nothing more than stragglers which she has transformed into swine. I did not sleep a wink last night, thinking of the danger to which you were exposed, and indeed I expected nothing less, than to find you this morning a barrow, fattened up for a feast, a day or two hence. Did you think such an old haridan as this can have any natural concupiscence for a man; or if she has, it is for a few days only, until she can make him fit for slaughter. Then by throwing a little water on him, or by the bare blowing of her breath, she makes a beefcow, or hog-meat of him, and he finds the knife at his throat, and scalding water taking off his bristles, and his guts out, and is into the pickling-tub before he knows what he is about. Do you think, Teague, that I have read books for nothing? Have you not seen me in my study, morning and night, looking over Greek, and Hebrew letters, like partridge tracks? All this to find out what was going on up and down the world. Many a history of witches, and conjurers, I have read, and know them when I see them, just as I would my own sheep, when I am at home. Better indeed, for unless my sheep are marked, I could not know them; but marked or not marked, I know witches; and if I am not mistaken, this is the greatest witch that ever run. She was all night in my room, in the shape of a cat. It is God's mercy, that she had not changed herself into an alligator, and eat you up before the morning. When I came into the room I expected to find nothing else but bones, and particles of hair, the remnant of her repast; but it seems she has thought you not fat enough, and has given you a day or two to run, to improve your flesh, and take the salt better. The worst thing, after transformation, is the having you cut, in order to make you fatter and better pork, which is generally done the first day; and castration is a painful operation, besides the loss of the part. I have had several of my acquaintances served in this manner, falling in with old women whom they took for fortunes; but were in reality witches, and had dealings with the devil. Teague by this time was out of bed, and had dressed himself in his overalls and short coat, and was ready for a march. Indeed he wished to escape as soon as possible; and descending the stairs, going to the stable, and saddling the horse, they both set out, without taking leave. It was in this manner Eneas quitted Dido, and got a ship-board, before she was awake; and the only difference was, that Teague had left no little Iulus in the hall, to put her in mind of the father. CHAP. II. TRAVELLING along, the Captain could not but observe to Teague, the injudicious choice he was about to make, even had the woman not been a necromancer. For the man who surrenders himself to the arms of a superannuated female, for the sake of fortune, acts a part not less unworthy and disgraceful, than the prostitute who does the same for half a crown. While a man has the use of his limbs and arms, he ought to be above such mercenary motives; and true happiness can be found only in congruity, and what is natural. Teague seemed still to have some hankering after the supper of ducks, and the feather bed; but as they proceeded, the recollection became more faint, for distance and time, is the cure of all passions.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">BOOK III. CHAP. I. PROCEEDING four or five miles, they breakfasted; and afterwards, going on a mile or two further, they came to a church where a number of people were convened, to hear the decision of an ecclesiastical consistory, met there on an affair which came before them. It was this: Two men appeared, the one of a grave aspect, with a black coat; the other without the same clerical colour of garb; but with papers in his pocket which announced his authority to preach, and officiatate as a clergyman. The man with the black coat, averred, that coming over together, in a vessel from Ireland, they had been messmates; and while he was asleep one night, being drowsy after prayers, the other had stolen his credentials from his pocket. The man in possession of the papers, averred they were his own, and that the other had taken his coat, and by advantage of the cloth, thought to pass for what he was not. The consistory found it difficult, without the aid of inspiration, to decide; and that faculty having now ceased, there were no other means, that they could see, to bring the truth to light. The Captain being informed of this perplexity, could not avoid stepping up, and addressing them as follows: Gentlemen, said he, there is a text in your own Scripture, which, I think, might enable you to decide: It is this, “by their fruits you shall know them.” Let the two men preach; and the best sermon take the purse; or laying aside the figure, let him that expounds the scripture best, be adjudged the clergyman. The proposition seemed reasonable, and was adopted; the competitors being desired to withdraw a little, and conn over their notes, that they might be ready to deliver a discourse respectively. The Captain observing the countenance of him in possession of the papers, was sensible, from his paleness, and dejection of aspect, that he was the impostor. Going out therefore shortly after, and falling in with him, as he walked in a melancholy mood, at a little distance from the church, said he to him, I perceive how it is, that the other is the preacher; nevertheless I would wish to assist you, and as I have been the means of bringing you into this predicament, I should be disposed to bring you out.—Let me know how the case really stands. The other candidly acknowledged that having been a yarn-merchant in Ireland, his capital had failed, and he had thought proper to embark for this country; and coming over with this clergyman, he had purloined his papers; and would have taken his coat, had it not been too little for him; a thing which never struck the ecclesiastical tribunal. But the matter being now reduced to an actual experiment of talents, he was at a loss; for he had never preached a sermon in his life. It was true, he had heard sermons and lectures in abundance; and had he been suffered to go on and preach at his leisure amongst the country people first, he might have done well enough; but to make his first essay in the presence of a learned body of the Vol. II. D clergy, would hazard a detection; but now he saw his oversight in not having taken the notes of the other, at the same time he took the vouchers of his mission. The Captain encouraged him, by observing, that there were few bodies, ecclesiastical or civil, in which there were more than one or two men of sense; that the majority of this consistory, might be as easily humbugged, as the lay people; that a good deal would depend on the text that he took; some were easily preached upon; others more difficult. An historical passage about Nimrod, or Nebuchadnezzar, or Sihon, king of the Amorites, or Og, king of Bashan; out of Genesis, or Deuteronomy, or the book of Judges, or Kings, would do very well; but that he should avoid carefully the book of Job, and the Psalms of David, and the Proverbs of Solomon; these requiring a considerable theological knowledge; or, at least, moral discussion and reflection. Keep a good heart, said he, and attempt the matter. The issue may be better than you apprehend. With this, taking him a little further to the one side, where his horse was tied, he took out a bottle from his saddle-bags, with a little whisky in it, which Teague had put there, and gave him a dram. This had a good effect, and raised his spirits, and he seemed now ready to enter the lists with his antagonist. The other, in the mean time, had gone in, and was ready, when called upon, to hold forth. The man with the papers returning, with the Captain not far behind, took his seat. The board signified, that one or other might ascend the pulpit. The credential man, wishing to gain time, to think farther what he was about to say, but affecting politeness, yielded precedence to the other, and desired him to preach first. Accordingly stepping up, he took his text and began. CHAP. III. The Sermon. Prov. viii. 33. Hear instruction and be wise, and refuse it not. INSISTING on these words, I shall enquire, 1. Whence it is that men are averse to instruction. 2. The misfortune of this disposition. Lastly, Conclude with inferences from the subject. 1. Whence it is that men are adverse to instruction. The first principle is indolence. The mind loves ease, and does not wish to be at the trouble of thinking. It is hard to collect ideas, and still harder to compose them; it is like rowing a boat: whereas, acting without thought, is like sailing before the wind, and the tide in our favour. The second principle is pride. It wounds the self love of men, to suppose that they need instruction. We resent more the being called fools than knaves. No man will own himself weak and uninformed. In fact, he has not humility to think he is: or, if he should be conscious of a want of knowledge, he is unwilling that others should have the same opinion: and he will not submit to be instructed, as that would imply that he is not already so. The third principle is passion. When we are disposed to satisfy the desires of the constitution, or the affections of the mind, which are unlawful, we do not wish to hear dissuasion from the indulgence. The lecture comes to torment before the time, when the consequence must afflict. Under the second head, we shall shew the misfortune of this disposition. It is what, in early life, begins to fix the difference of persons. The hearer of instruction, even with more moderate parts, becomes the more sensible boy. The hearer of instruction has a better chance for life and mature years. Into how many dangers do young persons run; leaping, climbing, running, playing truant, and neglecting books? Into what affrays too will passions prompt them, when they begin to feel the sinew strong, and the manly nerve braced? They value corporeal strength, which they D 2 have in common with the horse, or the ox, and neglect the cultivation of the mind, which is the glory of our nature. What is a man without information? In form only above a beast. What is a man, negligent of moral duty? Worse than a beast; because, he is destitute of that by which he might be governed, and of which his nature is capable; and without which, he is more dangerous, in proportion as he is more ingenious. I shall conclude with inferences from the subject. It may be seen hence, with what attention we ought to hear, and with what observation, see. The five senses are the avenues of knowledge; but the reflection of the mind on ideas presented, is the source of wisdom. Understanding is better than riches; for understanding leads to compotcency, and to know how to use it. Laying aside, therefore, all indolence, pride, and passion, let us hear instruction, and be wise, and refuse it not. This, reverend brethren, is a short sermon. It is one in miniature; like the model of a mechanical invention, which is complete in its parts, and from whence may be seen the powers of the inventor. I did not intend to take up your time with a long discourse; because, ex pede Herculem; you may know what I can do by this essay. The fact is, I am regularly bred, and licensed; but this my competitor, is no more than a yarn merchant; who, failing in his trade, has adventured to this country: And coming over in the vessel with me, took the opportunity one night, when I was asleep, and picked my fob of these papers, which he now shews. Thus having spoke, he descended. The other, in the mean time, had been at his wits end what to do. The technical difficulty of taking a text, and dividing it under several heads, and splitting each head into branches, and pursuing each with such strickness, that the thoughts should be ranged under each which belonged to it, as exactly as you would the coarser yarn with the coarser, and the finer with the finer; or put balls with balls, and hanks with hanks. At last he had determined to take no text at all; as it was much better to take none, than to take one and not stick to it. Accordingly, he resolved to preach up and down the scripture, wherever he could get a word of seasonable doctrine. Mounting the pulpit, therefore, he began as follows: The first man that we read of was Adam, and first woman Eve: she was tempted by the serpent, and eat the forbidden fruit. After this she conceived and bare a son, and called his name Cain; and Cain was a tiller of the ground, and Abel a keeper of sheep; for she conceived and bare a second son, and called his name Abel. And Cain slew Abel. There were several generations unto the flood, when Noah built an ark, and saved himself and his family. After the flood, Abraham begat Isaac, and Isaac begat Jacob, and Jacob begat Joseph and his brethren. Potiphar's wife, in Egypt, took a fancy for Joseph, and cast him in ward; and Potiphar was a captain of Pharaoh's guards; and Joseph interpreted Pharaoh's dream of the lean cattle; and there were twelve years famine in the land; and Moses passed for the son of Pharaoh's daughter, and married Jethro's daughter, in the land of Midian, and brought the Israelites out of the land of Egypt; and Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son Jephunneh; and the walls of Jericho fell down at the sound of ram's horns; and Sampson slew a thousand with the jaw-bone of an ass; and Delilah the harlot; and Gideon, and Barak, and Jephthah, and Abinoam the Giliaditish; and Samuel, and Saul, and the prophets; and Jonathan, and David; and Solomon built him an house; and silver was plenty as the street stones in Jerusalem; Rehoboam, and Jehosophat, and the kings of Israel and Juda; Daniel was cast into the lions' den; and Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego; and Isaiah and Jeremiah; and Zachariah, and Zerobabel; Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, and the apostles; Mary Magdalene, out of whom were cast seven devils; and the father of Zebedee's children; and Pontius Pilate, and the high priest, and Ananias and Sapphira, and the seven trumpets, in the Revelations, and the dragon, and the woman. Amen. I add no more. The lay people present were most pleased with the last discourse; and some of the younger of the clergy: But the more aged, gave the preference to the first. Thus it seemed difficult to decide. The Captain rising up, spoke: Gentlemen, said he, the men seem both to have considerable gifts, and I see no harm in letting them both preach. There is work enough for them in this new country; the first appears to me, to be more qualified for the city, as a very methodical preacher; but the last is the most practical; and each may answer a valuable purpose in their proper place. The decision seemed judicious, and it was agreed that they should both preach. The man who had been the yarn merchant, thanked their reverences, and gave out that he would preach there that day week, God willing. The clergy were so pleased with the Captain, that they gave him an invitation to go home with them to an elder's house, just by; but recollecting the trouble he had with Teague on another occasion, and the danger of being drawn into a like predicament, should he fall into conversation with the clergymen, and take it into his head to preach, he declined the invitation, and hastened to get his horse, and having Teague along side, proceeded on his journey.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">BOOK IV. CHAP. I. THE insuing day, the Captain arrived in a certain city, and put up at the sign of the Indian Queen. Taking a day or two to refresh himself, and get a new pair of breeches made, and his coat mended, which was a little worn at the elbows, he went to look about the city. The fourth day, when he had proposed to set out to perambulate this modern Babylon, and called for Teague to bring him his boots, there was no Teague there. The hostler being called, with whom he used to sleep, informed, that he had disappeared the day before. The Captain was alarmed; and, from the recollection of former incidents, began to enquire if there were any elections going on at that time. As it so happened, there was one that very day. Thinking it probable the bog-trotter, having still a hankering after an appointment might offer himself on that occasion, he set out to the place where the people were convened, to see if he could discover Teague amongst the candidates. He could see nothing of him; and though he made enquiry, he could hear no account. But the circumstance of the election drawing his attention for some time, he forgot Teague. The candidates were all remarkably pot-bellied; and waddled in their gait. The Captain enquiring what were the pretensions of these men to be elected; he was told, that they had all stock in the funds, and lived in large brick buildings; and some of them entertained fifty people at a time, and eat and drank abundantly; and, living an easy life, and pampering their appetites, they had swollen to this size. It is a strange thing, said the Captain, that in the country, in my route, they would elect no one but a weaver, or a whisky distiller; and here none but fat swabs, that guzzle wine, and smoke segars. It was not so in Greece, where Phocion came with his plain coat, from his humble dwelling, and directed the counsels of the people; or in Rome, where Cincinnatus was made dictator from the plough. Something must be wrong, where the inflate, and pompous are the objects of choice. Though there is one good arising from it, that there is no danger of my Teague here. He could not afford to give a dinner; and as to funds, he has not a single shilling in them. They will make him neither mayor nor legislator in this city. Na faith, said Mr. M`Donald, the Scotch gentleman who had been present at the embarrassment of the Captain, on the occasion of the former election; and having, a few days before, come to the city, and observing the Captain in the crowd, had come up to accost him, just as he was uttering these last words to himself: Na faith, said he, there is na danger of Teague here, unless he had his scores o' shares in the bank; and was in league with the brokers, and had a brick house at his hurdies, or a ship or twa on the stocks. A great deal used to be done, by employing advocates with the tradesmen, to listen to the news, and tell them fair stories; but all is now lost in substantial interest, and the funds command every thing. Besides, this city is swarming with Teagues, and O'Regans, Vol. II. E and O'Brians, and O'Murphys, and O'Farrels; I see, that they cannot be at a loss without your bog trotter. The Captain having his fears eased, in this particular, returned home, greatly troubled, nevertheless, that he could not come up with the Irishman. CHAP. II. REFLECTING with himself, that Teague was inclined to women, and that he might have gone to some of those houses, which are not in the best repute with the religious part of the community, the Captain thought it might not be amiss to make enquiry. Being informed by the waiter, that he had overheard gentlemen, at the house, in their cups, speak of a certain Mrs. Robeson, who kept a house of that kind; and, as far as he could understand, it was in such a part of the city, a few doors from such a street. The Captain having set out, coming into the neighbourhood, and making inquiry, was directed to the house. Knocking, and, on a servant coming to the door, enquiring for Mrs. Robeson; he was shewn into a parlour, and in a little time the old lady entered. Being seated, he took the liberty of addressing her: Madam, said he, I am not unacquainted with the stile and designation of your house. Why, as to that, said she, we do the best we can; but the times are hard, and it is a very difficult thing to pick up a good looking healthy girl, now a days. So many young women, since the war is over, having taken to virtuous ways, and got married, has almost broke us up. But I have been fortunate enough to light upon one, yesterday, that is a rare piece, just from the country; and I am sure — It is not in the way that you mean, madam, said the Captain, that I take the liberty to call upon you. I have a servant man, of the name of Teague O'Regan, that is inclined to women, and has been absent some days; and it has occurred to me, that he may have come to your house, or some other of the like kind; and may be skulking, to avoid my service. As he has little or no money, it is impossible he can be much in your way; and I could make it better worth your while to inform on him, and surrender him up. Teague O'Regan, said the old lady! snuffing; Teague O'Regan! I would have you know, sir, that no Teague O'Regans come here; we keep a house for the first gentlemen; not for waiters, or understrappers, or any of the common sorts. There is no half-crown, or five shilling pieces here. Teague O'Regan indeed! there is no Teague O'Regan at this house. We have meat for his master. I was saying there was a young woman just now from the country, that looks more like a woman of family, than a country girl; but is so melancholy and mopish, that she scarcely speaks; and stands in need of some one to talk to her, and keep her in spirits. She is fit for any gentleman. Teague O'Regan! Humph! There is no Teague O'Regan puts his foot into my door. The Captain assured her, that he by no means meant to give offence. That tho' the bog-trotter could not have access to her first rooms; yet he did not know but he might have got in with some of her under maids, and be about the kitchen. The lady, being now appeased on the score of Teague, was in a good humour, and renewed her hints to the Captain, with respect to the young woman. She is, said she, as good looking a girl as ever came to my house; and has not seen a single person but yourself, whom she has not yet seen; but may see, if you chuse; and E 2 a very pretty girl she is; but keeps mopish and melancholy, as if she was crossed in love, and had come to town for fear of her relations, and wishes to keep out of sight of every body. The Captain being no stranger to the art these matrons use, in their addresses, to enhance the value of their wares, was but little moved with the recommendation she had given. But as there were some circumstances in the account of the young woman, that were a little striking, his curiosity was excited to let her be called in, and present herself. Accordingly, the old lady stepping out, a young woman made her appearance, of considerable beauty; but in her countenance expressions of woe. Her blue eye seemed involved in mist; for she shed no tears; her sorrow was beyond that. Young woman, said the Captain, it is easy to perceive that you have not been in this way of life long; and that you have been brought to it, perhaps, by some uncommon circumstances. My humanity is interested; and it occurs to me to ask, by what means it has come to pass. The part which he seemed to take in her distress, inspiring her with confidence; and being requested by him to relate her story frankly, she began as follows: My father, said she, lives at the distance of about twenty miles from this city, and is a man of good estate. I have two brothers, but no sisters. My mother dying when I was at the age of fourteen, I became house-keeper for the family. There was a young man that used to come to the same church to which we went. He was of the very lowest class, mean in his appearance, of homely features, and a dimunitive person. Yet he had the assurance to put himself in my way on every occasion; endeavouring to catch my eye; for he did not dare to speak to me. But I hated him, and was almost resolved to stay at home on Sundays, to avoid him; for he began to be very troublesome. His attentions to me were taken notice of by my brothers. They were confident that I must give him some encouragement, or he would not make such advances. My father was of the same opinion. I assured them I had never given him any encouragement, and I never would; that I was as much averse to him as possible. I shunned him and hated him. He persisted a long time, almost two years, and seemed to become melancholy, and at last went away from the neighbourhood; and, as I heard afterwards, to sea. I began now to reflect upon his assiduity, and endeavours to engage my affections. I recollected every circumstance of his conduct towards me, since the first time I was obliged to take notice of him. I reasoned with myself, that it was no fault of his, if his family was low; and if he himself had not all that comeliness of person which I wished in a husband; yet he was sufficiently punished in his presumption in thinking of me, by what he must have suffered, and by his going to sea, which he did to get out of my sight, finding his attempts to gain my affections, hopeless. I dreamed of him; and scarcely a moment of the day passed, but my thoughts were running on the danger to which he was exposed. It seemed to me that if he came back, I should be more kind to him. I might at least shew him, that I was not insensible of his attachment. In about a year he returned, and the moment I saw him, I loved him. He did not dare to come to my father's house. But I could not help giving him encouragement, by my countenance, when I met him in public. Emboldened by this, he at last ventured to speak to me; and I agreed that he might come to a peach orchard, at some distance from my father's house, and that I would give him an interview. There he came often; and with a most lowly, and humble behaviour, fixed my regard for him. Not doubting the violence of his love for me, and my ascendency over him, I at last put myself in his power. Becoming pregnant, I hinted marriage; but what was my astonishment to find, that, on various pretences, he evaded it; and as I became more fond, he became more cold; which had no other effect, than to make me more ardent than before. It had been usual, for many months, to meet me every evening at this place; but now I had gone often, and did not find him there. At last he withdrew altogether, and I heard he had left the settlement. Worthless and base, as I now knew him to be; and, though my reason told me, that in person he was still as homely as I first thought him, yet I continued to love him to distraction. What was my distress, when my father, and my brothers, found that I was with child? They charged me, though unjustly, of having deceived them with respect to my attachment to this low creature, from the first: In fine, my father dismissed me from the house: My brothers, no less relenting than him, in their resentment against me, upbraided me with the offers I had refused, and the treatment I had given several gentlemen, in their advances to me. For, indeed, during the absence of this worthless man, I had been addressed by several; but my pity and compassion for the wretch, had so wrought upon me, that I could not think of any, or scarcely bear them to speak to me. Dismissed from my father's house, even my younger brother, who was most soft and yielding in his nature, seeming to approve of it, I went to the habitation of a tenant of my father; there remained some time, and endeavoured to make compensation, by the labour of my hands, for the trouble I was giving them. But these poor people, thinking my father would relent, had informed him where I was, and of the care they had taken of me. The consequence was, that, at the end of three months, he sent for the child, of which I had been brought to bed some weeks before; but ordered them instantly to dismiss me, that I might never more offend his hearing with my name. I wandered to this city, and the first night lay in the market house, upon a bench. The next morning mixed with the women that came to market, and enquired for work of any kind. I could find none; but at last meeting with a young woman who felt for my distress, she told me, that she had a small room in this city, where she had lived some time with an aunt that was lately dead; and that now she supported herself by doing a little in the millinery way; that if I would come and take breakfast with her, and see where she lived, I was welcome. Going with the poor girl, I found her lonely and distressed enough. Nevertheless I continued with her several months. But the work was small that we got to do, and times becoming still worse, I was obliged to sell the cloths that I brought with me, to the last petticoat and short gown, to support ourselves and pay rent. To bring me to the last stage of misery, the poor girl who was more expert than I was, in making any little provision that could be made, fell sick and in short time died. I could bear to stay no longer in the room, and coming out to wander in the streets, like a forlorn wretch indeed, and sobbing sorely by myself, when I thought no one heard me, I was observed by this woman, at whose house you now are, and pressed by her to go home. I soon found what sort of a house it was, and had I not been watched, when I talked of going away, and threatened to be sent to jail, for what, it is pretended I owe since I came to the house, I should not have been here longer than the first day. The Captain feeling with great sensibility the circumstances of her story, made reply: Said he, Young woman, I greatly commiserate your history and situation, and feel myself impelled to revenge your wrong. But the villain which has thus injured you, is out of my reach, in two respects; first, by distance; and second, being too contemptible and base to be pursued by my resentment even on your account. But revenge is not your object, but support and restoration to your friends, and the good opinion of the world. As to money, it is not in my power to advance you any great sum; but as far as words can go, I could wish to serve you: not words to yourself only; but to others, in your behalf. It is evident to me, that you have suffered by your own too great sensibility. It was humanity and generosity, that engaged you in his favour. It was your imagination, that gave those attractions to his vile and uncomely person, by which you was seduced. You have been a victim to your own goodness, and not to his merit. The warmth of your heart has overcome the strength of your judgment; and your prudence has been subdued by your passion: or, rather, indeed, confiding in a man whom you had saved from all the pains, and heart-felt miseries of unsuccessful love, you have become a sacrifice to your compassion and tenderness. The best advice I can give you, is, to compose yourself for this night. Preserve your virtue; for I do not consider you as having lost it: your mind has not been in fault, or contaminated. I will endeavour to find out some person, who may be disposed to assist you; and, though it may be difficult for you yet to establish lost fame, it is not impossible. So saying, he left the room; but the young woman, impressed with these last words especially, viz. the diffculty, if not impossibility, of regaining reputation, sunk Vol. II. F down upon her chair, and could not pay him the compliment of thanks, at his departure. During the night, through the whole of which he lay awake, at the public house, he ruminated on the extraordinary nature of this incident, and the means which he would adopt to recover this woman from her unfortunate situation. Thought he, I am in a city where there are a great body of the people called Quakers. This society, above all others, is remarkable for humanity, and charitable actions. There is a female preacher, of whom I have heard; a Lydia Wilson: I will inform this good woman of the circumstance; and, if ge gives me leave, I will bring this stray sheep to her; she may have it in her power to introduce her to some place, where, by needle work, and industry, she might live, until it may be in my power, taking a journey to her father, and stating the case, and giving my sentiments, to restore her to her family. Early next morning, as soon as it could be presumed, the Quaker lady had set her house in order; that is, after the family might be supposed to have breakfasted, which was about nine o'clock, the Captain set out; and being admitted, stated to Mrs. Wilson, the exact circumstances as before related. The pious woman readily undertook every office in her power. Accordingly, taking leave, the Captain set out for the house of Mrs. Robeson. At the door, he met a number of men coming out, and, on inquiry, he found a coroner's inquest had just sat on the body of a young woman of the house, who had the preceding evening, suspended herself from the bed post with her garter. He was struck, suspecting it must be the young woman whom he had so much in his thoughts. Going in, and enquiring, he found it to be the case; and that they proposed to bury as soon as the few boards of a coffin could be got ready. As a man of humanity, he could not but shed tears; and blame himself that he had not given her stronger assurance of his interposition before he left her, that she might not have fallen into despair, and taken away her life. The coffin being now ready, the funeral set out, not for the burying ground of a church yard; but for a place without the city, called the Potter's-field: For suicide forfeits Christian burial: Her obsequies attended, not by a clergyman in front, nor by scarfed mourners, holding up the pall; nor was she borne on a bier, but drawn on a cart; and the company that followed her uncovered herse, were not decent matrons, nor venerable men, but old bauds, and strumpets, and cullies, half drunk, making merry as they went along. Being interred, they returned home; but the Captain remaining some time, contemplating the grave, thus spoke: Earth, thou coverest the body of a lovely woman, and with a mind not less lovely; yet doomed in her burial, to the same ground with negroes, and malefactors; not that I think the circumstance makes any difference; but it shews the opinion of the world with respect to thy personal demerit. Nor do I call in question the justness of this opinion; having such circumstances whereon to found it. But I reflect with myself how much opinion, operating like a general law, may do injustice. It remains only with heaven's chancery to reach the equity of the case, and absolve her from a crime; or at least qualify that which was the excess of virtue. If the fair elements that composed her frame, shall ever again unite, and rise to life, and as the divines suppose, her form receive its shape, and complexion from her mental qualities, and conduct on earth, she will lose nothing of her beauty; for her daring disdain of herself and fate, was a mark of repentance,—stronger than all tears. Yet, had she acted the nobler part of holding herself in life, preserving her mind and body chaste until famine had taken her away, or the hand of heaven moved for her relief, she had shone, at the last rising, with superior brightness; been ranked amongst the first beauties of heaven, and walked distinguished in the paradise of God. Doubtless the Almighty must blame, and chide her for this premature and rash step. Fallen to the last point of depression, he was about to relieve her, and the sequel of her days might have been happy and serene. It was a distrust of his providence. She heard my words, though she did not know my heart. And surely it was my intention to relieve her. But she erred against my thoughts; she eluded the grasp of my humanity. For this she will be reprimanded by the Most High; and fail of that supereminent glory which awaits heroic minds. Yet, O world, thou F 2 dost her wrong, in sentencing her to so low a bed. Shall the wealthy, but dishonest men; matrons chaste, but cold and cruel in their feelings; shall these have a stone built over them, and occupy a consecrated spot; whilst thou, unworthy, art thrown amongst the rubbish of carcases, swept from jails; or of emigrants, unknown as to their origin and place. Farewel, lovely form, whom late I knew; and let the grass grow green upon thy grave. Thy sorrows are expunged; but mine are awake; and will be so, until I also come to the shades invisible, and have the same apathy of heart with thee.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">BOOK V. CHAP. I. RETURNING to his lodging, he could not help reflecting by the way, that probably poor Teague, mortified by repeated disappointments, in going to Congress, being suffered to preach, or be a member of the Philosophical Society; and what might afflict him still more, the not marrying the rich hostess, who had made him overtures, might, in his despair of ever coming forward in any respectable capacity in life, have suspended himself from a beam, or plunged into the river, and have put an end to his existence; which, should it be the case, being in some measure accessary to this catastrophe of the bog-trotter, by dissuading from these several pretensions, he could not acquit himself of guilt; at all events, he would feel great pain and sorrow. Such were his reflections for a great part of this day; and had thought of putting an advertisement in the paper, to know if any dead body had been lately discovered; or inquisition held on a young man, with red hair, and a long leg, who had been missing some days, and was supposed to have hung or drowned himself. But in the evening, meditating thus, mention being made by some of the lodgers, of going to hear the annual oration, delivered before the Philosophical Society, by a member; it struck his mind, that possibly Teague, falling in with some of this body, had been induced by them to take a seat, and might be present on that occasion. Not hesitating, therefore, he seconded the proposal of going; and offered to be of the party. Coming to the hall, the philosophers were seated; but a black member sat with a taper before him, who, it seems, was to deliver the oration. The fact was this; A gentleman of Maryland of the name of Gorum, had sent to the society, some time before, a curiosity found by one of his negroes in the mud of Wye river, on the banks of which his seat was. It appeared to be a stone, with a cavity sufficient to receive a man's foot, and was adjudged by the society to be an Indian's petrified moccason. The singularity of the discovery, well intitling the gentleman to a seat, he was invited; but sending his compliments, he gave them to understand, that Cuff, (for that was the name of the negro) was more intitled to that honour than he was, being the person who had found the curiosity; and as he made it a point to do his slaves justice in any perquisite of their own, he could not think of robbing one, on this occasion of any honour, to which he might be introduced by this discovery. The society approved his honesty, and fair dealing; and by unanimous ballot, admitted the negro; who, having been a member some time, had been appointed, to pronounce the annual oration. Cuff, a good deal disconcerted in hearing of the task imposed upon him, had applied to his master to know what to say. Colonel Gorum attending a good deal to literary matters, had heard of an oration delivered before the society, the object of which was to prove that the Africans had been once white, had sharp noses, and long hair; but that by living in sun-burnt climates, the skin had changed colour, the hair become frizzled, and in the course of generation, the imagination of the mother, presenting obtuse objects, had produced an offspring with flat noses. He therefore gave Cuff to understand, that it would be doing no more than justice to his countrymen, for he was a Guinea negro, if he should avail himself of this occasion to prove that men were all once black, and that by living in snowy countries, and being bleached by the weather, the skin had gradually become white, and the hair moist and long, and the imagination presenting prominent objects to the mothers, or the fathers differing among themselves, and pulling one another by this part, had given the long and pointed nose. Cuff, thus prepared, set out; having arrived, and being on this occasion to harangue, began as follows: The Oration. Massa shentiman; I be cash crab in de Wye riva: found ting in de mud; tone, big a man's foot: hols like to he; fetch Massa: Massa say, it be de Indian moccason.—O! fat de call it; all tone. He say, you be a filasafa, Cuff: I say, O no, Massa; you be de filasafa. Wel; two tree monts afta, Massa call me, and say, You be a filasafa, Cuff, fo' sartan: Getta ready, and go dis city, and make grate peech for shentima filasafa. I say, Fat say? Massa: Massa say, somebody say, dat de first man was de site man; but you say, dat de first man was de black a-man. Vel, I set out out: come along: Massa gi me pass. Some say, where you go, Cuff? I say, dis city, be a filasafa. O no, Cuff, you be no filasafa: call me fool, gi me kick i'de backside; fall down, get up again, and come to dis city. Now, shentima, I say, dat de first man was de black a man, and de first woman de black a woman; an get two tree children; de rain vasha dese, an de snow pleach, an de coula come brown, yella, coppa coula, and, at de last, quite fite; an de hair long; an da fal out vid van anoda; and van cash by de nose, an pull; so de nose come lang, sharp nose. Now I go home, Massa shentima; an tel grate Massa, dat make peech, an ibedy body vas da; an den Cuff fin a more tings—cabs, oysta, cat-fish, bones, tones, ibedy ting; sen to you, shentima. The oration being ended, the Society could do no less than appoint a committee to wait on Mr. Cuff, and request a copy of his oration, that it might be published. But the Captain, in the mean time, had examined, with great attention, the whole audience; but could not discover Teague. Departing, therefore, with the rest, his thoughts recurred to his first idea, viz. that the unfortunate creature had committed suicide. Drawing up, therefore, an advertisement, he sent it to a daily paper; but, though it appeared next morning, and the day elapsed, there was no word of Teague. CHAP. II. THERE is no fact that has proved more stubborn than the diversity of the human species; especially that great extreme of diversity in the natives of Africa. How the descendants of Adam and Eve, both good looking people, should ever come to be a vile negro, or even a mulatto man or woman, is puzzling. Some have conjectured, that a black complexion, frizzled hair, a flat nose, and bandy legs, were the mark set on Cain, for the murder of his brother Abel. But, as the deluge drowned the whole world, and only one family was saved, the blacks must have all perished; like the Mammoth, whose bones are found on the Ohio, and other places, which was too big for Noah to get into the ark. Some suppose, that it was the curse pronounced upon Canaan, the son of Noah, for looking at his father's nakedness. They got rid by this means of the difficulty of Vol. II. G the flood; but by Moses' own account, the Canaanites were the descendents of Canaan; and we do not hear of them being negroes; which, had it been the case, we cannot doubt would have been laid hold of by the Israelites, as a circumstance to justify their extirpating, or making slaves of them. Lord Kames, in his Sketches of the History of Man, solves the difficulty, by supposing, that, at the building of Babel, there was a confusion of complexions, as well as languages. But, besides that it is not to be supposed, that the historian would pass over so material a circumstance, without particularly mentioning it, it is introducing a miracle, which we are not warranted in doing, unless it had been expressly laid down to have been wrought. The last theory, has been that of accounting for the change, from the climate, and accident of wind and weather; calling in aid, in the mean time, the imagination of the mothers. This does not appear altogether satisfactory. At least, there are those who would not be averse to hear some other solution of the difficulty. I have thought of one, which I would suggest with great diffidence; the authors of those before me being great men, and their hypothesis not lightly overthrown. I am of opinion that Adam was a tall, straight limbed, red haired man, with a fair complexion, blue eyes, and an aquiline nose; and that Eve was a negro woman. For what necessity to make them both of the same colour, feature, and form, when there is beauty in variety. Do not you see in a tulip, one leaf blue, and another white, and sometimes the same leaf white and red? As God made Adam in his own likeness, so it is to be supposed, that Adam begat some in his; and these were red haired, fair complexioned, blue eyed, proportionably featured boys and girls; while, on the other hand, some took after the mother, and became negro men and women. From a mixture of complexion, the offspring, at other times, might be a shade darker, in one case, than the father; and a shade lighter, in another case, than the mother; and hence, a diversifyed progeny, with a variety of features; from the bottle-nose to the mire-snipe; which is that of the people in the west of Ireland; and from the auburn of the Corsican hair, to the golden locks of the Caledonian beauty; and from the black eye, to the hazle and the grey. It may be asked, How at the flood? when Noah, his wife, his three sons, and their wives, eight persons, only were saved? It is but giving some of the sons negro wenches for their wives, and you have the matter all right. CHAP. III. AS I have said, the day passed over, and there was no word of Teague. In the evening, as it was usual with the gentlemen at the Indian Queen, to go to some place for the amusement of an hour or two; mention being made of a celebrated preacher, a Universalist, as he was called; that is, one who preaches the doctrine of universal salvation; it was proposed to go to hear him, as he was to hold forth that evening. The Captain readily consented; and it struck him, that, as this was a new fangled doctrine, and the preacher had made a great noise; and as it was a doctrine that, conscious of a good deal of fornication, would naturally please Teague, it was not impossible but the Irishman might have become a disciple of this reformist, and be at his conventicle. Coming in amongst the crowd, and obtaining seats, they saw the preacher ascend the pulpit, and, after the preliminary exercise G 2 of psalms and prayer, take a text, and begin his sermon. His text was taken from one of those passages of scripture, which speaks of “the lion lying down with the kid, and the tyger with the lamb;” which have been interpreted of the Millenium; but were applied by him, to that period, when, as the sea shall give up her dead, so hell shall give up her damned; and the devil himself shall come to lick salt out of the hand of an angel. Enlarging on this doctrine, and supporting it with a variety of proofs from scripture, and arguments from reason, he seemed to have brought the matter to a point; answering all objections, and closing in with the hearer. At this stage, using that figure of oratory, which is usual in the pulpit, of asking questions, and pressing for an answer, but expecting none; he would say, Is not this conclusive? Is it not evident? Is there any here can advance an argument against it? Will any of you speak—I pause for an answer? Mr. M`Donald, in the mean time, (the Scotch gentleman; who happened to be there,) thinking him really serious, and that he wanted an answer; or taking advantage of the pause, and the interrogation, to speak his mind, leaning over the front of a back seat, made reply: Why, said he, I like the doctrine well enough, and ha' na' disposition to o'erthrow it. I dinna muckle care if there ware na' hell ava. If ye could make that out, I wad rather hear it, than o' being smoaked twa' or three thousand years in the devil's nuke, or singed wi' his burnt brimstone, even if we should get out afterwards. Ye need na' put yoursel in a passion, or be flee'd that you'll no get proselytes; for I shall warrant you, as many every night as ye can weel stow awa i' the conventicle. The preacher giving thanks to God for the success in his ministry, in the remarkable conversion of the man who spoke, the Scotch gentleman said again; Ye need na ca' it a conversion; for I ha' been o' the same opinion a' my life; that it was a sare thing to bide the kiln of hell, and they wad deserve muckle thanks wha could establish that we should na' stay long in it, or that there was na' such place ava. The preacher commenting upon this, observed that some were orthodox from their birth, like Jeremiah, who was sanctified in his mother's womb; but others were hardly brought to the truth, with much teaching and instruction. That the present was a happy instance of one who was in the right way from his very early years. The Captain in the mean time, had been thinking of the doctrine; and thought it reasonable to suppose, that the Almighty might relieve after some time, and let the damned devils go. Just as with himself at present in the case of Teague; if he had got his hands on the bog-trotter, he could not help being very angry, and would be disposed to punish him with great severity; but after some time he knew his passion would subside, and he would forget his delinquencies. Teague in this manner running in his head, as the people, after some epilogue of prayer and benediction, being dismissed, were retiring, he got up, and raising his voice, begged the audience to detain a little. — Good people, said he, if any of you should come across a young man, a servant of mine, of the name of Teague O'Regan, I shall thank you to send me notice to the Indian Queen, where I lodge. And, according to the advertisement in this day's paper, I will give two dollars reward. Thinking him deranged in his brain, they proceeded, and took no notice of the proclamation. CHAP. IV. Containing Observations. IN the infancy of Christianity it was thought a hard matter to get to heaven; and that when once in hell, there was no geting out. A certain father of the church, of the name of Origen, was the first to be more liberal in his sentiments, and thought, that after a certain period, there would be a jail-delivery of the damned. I do not know that he went so far as to let the devils themselves out upon a furlough; but at the present time, we all know very well, that the time will come, when they will be out all together; at least the universalists tell us this, and prove it. The doctrine was received in some part by the early councils; but in other parts rejected. The matter was compounded by establishing a purgatory; for not consenting to liberate from hell, in order to satisfy the advocates of a temporary punishment, they fixed up a middle place, where all the advantages of penal purgation could be enjoyed, without the necessity of contradicting the eternity of hell torments. Indeed under the catholic church, the strait gate, and the narrow way, and the many called, and few chosen, was a good deal laid aside, and the road made pretty plain by indulgencies and absolutions. But at the reformation, the matter was brought back to its old bed again, and the cry of their being but a remnant saved, was raised in every pulpit. There has been some relaxation of late years with almost every sect of Protestants; and there is not just such a fury of tumbling great crowds into the tolbooth, as there was in the days of John Knox, and the framers of the Westminster confession of faith, and catechisms. Dr. Bellamy, a New-England divine, some years ago, stated in his pamphlet, that the damned would be to the saved, as the malefactors of a country to honest people that came to an untimely end by jail or gibbet. Some now preach boldly, not perhaps a total exemption, from future punishment, but a final restoration from it; so that the matter is now brought nearly to what it was in the days of Origen. I do not know that I would be of opinion with the Scotch gentleman, and wish the matter carried farther, establishing that there is no hell at all; because if the thing should take a turn, it might go to the other extreme, and be all hell; so that none should be saved; and instead of universal salvation, we should then have the doctrine of the damnation of the whole, bodily. CHAP. V. THE next day, revolving every thing in his mind, it occurred to the Captain, that the Irishman might have gone out of town, hearing of an election at a district, and have been elected to Congress. As that body was then sitting, he thought it could be no great trouble to go to the house, and cast an eye from the gallery, and see if the raggamuffin had got there. There was one that had a little of the brogue of Teague upon his tongue, but nothing of his physiognomy; others had a good deal of his manner; but there was none that came absolutely up to the physic of his person. However, being here, the Captain tho't it not amiss to listen a while to the debates upon the carpet. A certain bill was depending, and made, it seems, the order of the day. Mr. Cogan being on the floor, spoke:—Sir, said he, addressing himself to the chair, the bill in contemplation, is, in Vol. II. H my opinion, of a dangerous tendency. I will venture to foretel, that, if it goes into a law, the cows will have fewer calves, and the sheep less wool; hens will lay fewer eggs, and cocks forget to crow day-light. The horses will be worse shod, and stumble more; our watches go too slow; corns grow upon our toes; young women have the stomach ach; old men the gout; and middle aged persons fainting fits. The larks will fall dead in the field; the frogs croak till they burst their bags; and the leaves of the trees fall before the autumn. Snow will be found in the heat of harvest, and dog days in winter. The rivers will revert; and the shadows fall to the east in the morning. The moon will be eclipsed; and the equinoxes happen at a wrong season of the year. Was it not such a bill as this, that changed the old stile; that made the eclipse in the time of Julius Cesar; that produced an earthquake at Jamaica, and sunk Port Royal? All history, both ancient and modern, is full of the mischiefs of such a bill. I shall, therefore, vote against it. Mr. Bogan was now on the floor, and advocated the good effects of the bill. Sir, said he, addressing himself to the chair, I appear in support of the bill. I say, it will have a good effect on the physical world especially. The ducks will be fatter, the geese heavier, the swans whiter, the red-birds sing better, and partridges come more easily into traps. It will kill rats, muzzle calves, and cut colts; and multiply the breed of oysters, and pickle cod-fish. It will moderate the sun's heat, and the winter's cold; prevent fogs, and cure the ague. It will help the natural brain; brace the nerves, cure sore eyes, and the cholic, and remove rheumatisms. Consult experience, and it will be found, that provisions of the nature proposed by this bill, have an astonishing influence in this respect, where they have been tried. I must take the liberty to say, the gentleman's allegations are totally unfounded; and he has committed himself, in the matter of his history; the earthquake in Jamaica, not happening in the time of Julius Cesar; and therefore could have nothing to do with the eclipse of the sun. I shall, therefore, vote in favour of the bill. Mr. Cogan rose to explain; and said, that he did not say, that the earthquake at Jamaica, was at the same time with the clipse of the sun, which happened at the birth of Julius Cesar. Mr. Bogan rose to correct the gentleman: It was not at the birth of Julius Cesar, but at his death, that the earthquake happened. Mr. Hogan was on the floor: Said, he thought he could reconcile the gentlemen on that head. It was well known Julius Cesar lived about the time of the rebellion in Scotland; a little after Nebuchadnezzar, king of the Jews. As to the earthquake, he did not remember what year it happened; and therefore could say nothing about it. At this period, the question being called, it was put, and carried by a majority of 25. The Captain, satisfied with this sample of Congressional debates, retired, and came to his lodging. CHAP. VI. IT was about three or four o'clock in the afternoon, that some one, who had read the advertisement respecting Teague, came to the Captain, and informed him, that a person, answering the description, had been lately employed to teach Greek in the University. Struck with the idea, that the bog-trotter might have passed himself for a Greek scholar, whereas he understood only Irish, he set out to the University, to make enquiry. Knocking at the door of the principal, he was admitted; and, being seated, addressed him as follows: Said he, sir, a pedeseque of mine, (for talking to the rector of a college, he did not chuse to use the vulgar terms, waiter, or bog-trotter,) a pedeseque of mine, whom I have found useful, save that he is somewhat troublesome in pretending to places of appointment for which he is not H 2 qualified; a thing, by the bye, too common in this country; where men, without the aid of academic knowledge, thrust themselves into places requiring great learning and ability: (This he said to slatter the man of letters; as if a man could know but little, that had not been forged or furbished at his school): I say, this pedeseque of mine, has absconded for some days; and I have been able to collect no account of him until last evening, that a person, having read an advertisement of mine in the gazette, came to me, and informed, that one, answering the description I had given, both as to appearance and accomplishments, had been lately employed, as professor of the Greek language, in this University. Now, though I well know this Pady, as I may call him, to understand no Greek; yet, as he speaks Irish, and has much assurance, and little honesty in matters where his ambition is concerned, I did not know, but he might have imposed himself upon you, for a Greek scholar, and obtained a professorship. The principal made answer, that it was true that a person from Ireland had been lately employed in that capacity; and that should he be discovered to be an inpostor, it would be using the university very ill. The Captain thought so too; and taking it for granted that it was Teague, expressed his surprise that they had not examined him, before he was admitted; or at least had such proof by letters as would have had ascertained his being qualified. The principal observed, that as to examination they had no one at hand to examine, as there were none of the trustees or professors of other branches in the university understood Greek; as for himself he did not, having not studied it in early life, and for a series of years, having giving himself to politics and mathematics; so that unless they could send out for a Roman Catholic priest, or a Scotch clergyman, there was none to examine. The improbability of any person passing himself, above all things, for a master of the Greek language on the score of understanding Irish, was such, that it never came into their heads to suspect it, so as to demand letters. Had you known said the Captain, this bog-trotter of mine, (here he forgot the word pedeseque) as well as I do, you would not be surprised at his attempting any thing; and that he should be now in your academy giving Greek lectures, understanding nothing but the vernacular tongue of his own country. Here he gave an account of his setting up for Congress, &amp;c. as explained in the preceding part of this narrative. However, wishing to see the raggamuffin that he might unkennel him, he was accompanied by the principal to the chamber of the pseudo professor, considering as he went along, in what manner he should accost him; whether he should break out upon him with a direct invective, or with ironical words; such as, Mr. Professor, you must be a very learned man, not only to understand Irish, but Greek: but perhaps the Greek and Irish language are much the same. It must be so; for I know that a few days ago, you did not understand a word of this, and to acquire a dead language in such a short time would be impossible, unless the living tongue was a good deal a-kin to it. But I had never understood that Irish had any more affinity to the language of Athens and Sparta, than the Erse, or the German, or the Welch; however, we must live and learn, as the saying is; you have shewn us what we never knew before. Conning a speech of this sort in his own mind, with a view to divert the principal, and amuse himself with Teague, he entered the chamber of the professor; who sat in an elbow chair with Thucidydes before him. What was the surprise of the Captain to find that it was not Teague. In fact, it was a person not wholly unlike him, especially in a hinge of the brogue which he betrayed in his discourse; for though the professor was really a man of education, having been early sent to St. Omer's, where he had studied, being intended for a priest, and understood not only the Greek, and Latin, but spoke French; yet in the pronunciation of the English tongue, he had that prolongation of the sound of a word, and articulation of the vowel O, which constitutes what is vulgarly called the brogue, as being the pronunciation of the native Irish; who being a depressed people, are most of them poor, and wear a kind of mean shoe, which they call a brogue. After an apology to the professor for mistaking him for a certain Teague O'Regan, whom he had in his employment, at the request of the professor, the principal and the Captain took seats. The professor said, His name was not O'Regan, being O'Dougherty; but he knew the O'Regans very well in Ireland. There was a Pady O'Regan in the same class with him at St. Omer's, when he read Craike. That he was a good scholar, and understood Craike very well; and he would be glad if he was over in this country to tach Craike here; it appeared to be a very scarce language; but he had become a praste, and was now a missionary to Paraguay, in Sout-America. The Captain punning on his pronunciation of the word Greek; and willing to amuse himself a little with the professor, could not help observing, that he was under a mistake, as to the scarceness of the Craike language in these States. That there were whole tribes who spoke the Craike language; there was that of the heron, and the raven, and several other fowls. A German professor, who was present, apprehending the Captain to be under a mistake, and willing to correct him, observed—It is, said he, the Creek language, that the professor means. As to that, said the Captain, it is also spoken plentifully in America. There is a whole nation of Indians, on the borders of South Carolina and Georgia, that speak the Creek language; men, women, and children. The professor knowing more of the classics than of the geography of these United States, and of the heathen gods more than of the aborigines of this country, expressed astonishment. If what you tell me be a trut, said he, it is a crate discovery: perhaps dese may have de fragments o' de books o' de philosophers and poets that are lost, and de professors cannot come acrass in deir own countries; but I have tought dat de Craike language was spoke only in de Morea, and a little in Russia, and Constantinople. The Captain assured him, the principal favouring the mistake, by a grave face, and bowing as the Captain spoke, that it was absolutely the vernacular language of these people. Why den, said the other, do dey not get professors from amongst dese, to tache Craike in deir Colleges? Because, said the Captain, we have been heretofore on hostile terms with these Indians; and it is but of late that we have made a peace. But now, it is to be presumed, we shall have it in our power to procure from them able teachers. The professor was alarmed at this; as supposing it would supercede the necessity of his services; or, at least, much reduce the price of his tuition. He could have wished he had not come to this quarter of the world; and was almost ready, in his own mind, to bind up what he had, and go back to Clogher. So ended their visit to the University, and the Captain withdrew. CHAP. VII. Containing an Anecdote. IT may be thought a preposterous idea, that it could, for a moment, be supposed possible, that the pedeseque could have had the assurance to pass himself for a Grecian. But I had it from the Marquis de la Luzerne, that a friend of his, who was in some public capacity at Moscow; and was entertained by a principal inhabitant of the city, was asked by him, to visit an academy, where the French language was taught; and at which his son, a young lad, then was. What was the surprise of the gentleman, to find a Pady from Cork, who understood not a single word of French, or Latin, teaching an unknown gibberish, which most probably was Irish? Vol. II. I CHAP. VIII. OUR Chevalier was now at his wits end; not being able to conceive of any other place of amusement, in which Teague might be found; when all at once it came into his head, (led to it, perhaps, from the reference, in his late conversation, to the Indian tribes,) that probably he might have fallen in with the Indian treaty-man, and have been prevailed upon to personate a chief. It appeared to him therefore adviseable to go directly to the secretary at war, to know if any party of Indians had been lately there to negociate a treaty. Being introduced, and after some ceremony, accosting the secretary, he gave him to understand why it was that he had the honour to wait upon him, viz. that he had a servant of the name of Teague O'Regan, an Irishman, who had been absent some days, and that from a circumstance which happened in the way to the city, he had reason to suspect, he might have been picked up by a certain Indian treaty-man, to supply the place of a Welch blacksmith, who had died, and had passed for a chief of the Kickapoos. The secretary was a good deal chagrined, believing the Captain to be some wag that had come to make this enquiry by way of burlesque on the Indian treaties; and with some irritation of mind, gave him to understand, that there had been no Indian treaty-man, or Kickapoo chief there; that no treaty had been held with the Indians for above a month past, since the king of the Togamogans had drawn goods; but treaty or no treaty, it ill became him in the appearance of a gentleman, to throw a burlesque upon government, by insinuating that his Irishman could be imposed upon them for a chief. I mean no burlesque, said the Captain, a little irritated in his turn; I have had too much trouble to keep him from the Indian treaty-man that was coming here, to be disposed to jest with so serious an affair. The hair-breadth escape of going to Congress, or being licenced as a preacher, or being chosen as a member of the philosophical society, was nothing to this, as it was so difficult to guard against it, the Indian recruiters imitating savages, not only in their dress and painting, but in the dexterity to way-lay and surprise. I wish youto know, sir, said the secretary, that I comprehend your burlesque very well. But though you and others may misrepresent our policy in the Indian treaties, it is base irony and ridicule to insinuate that the Indians we treat with, are not chiefs. Chiefs, or no chiefs, said the Capain, I am not saying, nor care; but only wish to know if you have been instituting any treaty with my Teague, who has been absent some days. I will be much obliged to you to withdraw from my office, said the secretary. I shall withdraw, said the Captain; and not with that respect for your understanding and politeness, which I could have wished to entertain. I have addressed you with civility; and I was entitled to a civil answer; but I see the “insolence of office,” is well enumerated, by the poet, amongst the evils that make us sick of life. Your humble servant Monsieur Secretary; I shall trouble you no further. CHAP. IX. RETURNING to the Indian Queen, a play bill, for the evening, had announced the performance of the tragedy of Macbeth, and a farce called the Poor Solider. A party of the gentlemen, from the public house, had taken a box; and the Captain agreed to go with them to the play. Having delivered their tickets, and being admitted to the box, it struck the Captain to cast his eye upon the pit and galleries, and observe if he could any way descry the physiognomy of Teague. As before, when with the same view he surveyed the members of Congress, he could discover several that a good deal resembled him; but yet not the identical person. The curtain being now drawn the play began. Nothing material occured during the performance of the tragedy, save that when the witches came in, there was one in her cap and broomstick whose features a good deal resembled the Irishman's, and who, had she not been an old I 2 woman and a witch, might have passed for Teague. The Captain was struck with the resemblance of feature, and long frame of the bog-trotter, covered with a short gown and petticoat; and borrowing a glass from one that sat in the box with him, endeavoured to reconnoitre more perfectly, and could have sworn that it was the mother, or sister of Teague, that had just came from Ireland, and joined the company. The tragedy being ended, the farce began to be acted, and who should come forward in the character of Darby, but the long sought for Teague. The fact was, he had before appeared in the tragedy, in the character of an over-grown red-headed witch. It was more natural for him to appear in the character of Darby his own countryman; for he spake with the brogue naturally, and not by imitation. The managers had had him all the while of his absence from the Captain, under tuition, teaching him his part, which was not difficult to do; the manner and pronunciation being already his own. It was this had induced the managers to take him up, as a substitute; the person who actually played the part of Darby, being, at this time, out of the way. As the natural squal of a pig is superior to an imitation of it; so it was allowed by the audiance, that Teague exceeded the pseudo Irishman that usually performed this part. All were pleased but the Captain, whose sense of propriety could scarcely restrain him from throwing his cane at the begtrotter. Thought he with himself, what avails it that I prevented him from taking a seat in a legislative body, or from preaching, or being a philosopher; if after all, he has relinquished my service, and turned player; a thing, no doubt, fitter for him, than the being a senator, or clergyman, or philosopher; because he can appear in some low character in the farce or comedy, and come off tolerably enough. For though amongst the dramatis personæ of learned bodies, there are Tony Lumpkins, and Darby M`Faddins in abundance, yet there ought to be none; and Teague had better be on the stage than in such capacities, since he must be some where. But to leave me without notice, after all my civilities to him, is ungrateful, and deserves all that I can say bad concerning him. I shall give myself no farther trouble on this head; but let him take his course. I must endeavour to find another servant who can supply his place.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">BOOK VI. CHAP. I. THE foregoing had been the reflections of the Captain during the exhibition of the farce. But the play being ended, and having come home, the next day he began to put his resolution in practice; and to think how he could supply himself with another servant. It struck him to purchase a negro; and mentioning this to the company, at breakfast, at the Indian Queen, one of the people called Quakers, who was present, and overheard the conversation, made an apology for the liberty he took in making some objections. Friend, said he, thee appears to be a discreet man, from thy behaviour, and conversation; and if thee will not be offended, I would ask if thee canst reconcile it with thy principles, to keep a slave. As to that, said the Captain, I have thought upon the subject, and do not see any great harm in the matter. If we look to inanimate nature, we shall find, that the great law is Force. The Cartesians call it pressure and suction: The Newtonians call it attraction and gravitation. The sun, the largest body in the universe, endeavours to draw all towards it; while the lesser globes struggle to fly off at a tangent. The dense air takes place of the rare; and the heavier particles of water cause the lighter to recede. The tall oak overshades the under wood. There is a predominancy, and subordination in all things. In the animal creation, the weaker is always subject to the strong; who even devour them, when the flesh suits their appetite: and the very teeth and jaw-bone of carnivorous animals, shew the intention of nature, that they should make a prey of living creatures. Do you blame yourselves, when you subjugate elephants, or horses, or oxen of the plough, to your use? What right have you to invade the liberty of a playful young colt, more than of an African inhabitant? Or have you not as good a right to take up a negro, and put him to your work, as you have to cut a calf, and manufacture him for the draft? In this case, there is a difference, said the Quaker; a negro is a human creature, and possesses all the natural rights of man. That may be, said the Captain. But what are the natural rights of men? Are they not finally resolvable, as in the inanimate world, into power on the one hand, and weakness on the other. Who is it that abstains from dominion, when he has it in his power to assert it? Power is the great law of nature; and nothing but the pacts or conventions of society can contravene it. I should think myself justifiable in making any man a slave to answer my purposes, provided I treated him well while he was such. This I take to be the only condition which the law of reason annexes to the enjoyment of such property. I may be warranted in taking, and managing an animal of the horse kind; but it is my indisputable duty not to abuse him by causing him to suffer famine, or endure too much toil. The same with any other animal that I enslave; there is a tacit condition annexed to the grant which the law of nature gives, viz. That the service be exacted with moderation; and proper nourishment be provided. I admit also, that humanity would dictate that a slave ought to be consulted as much as is consistent with my convenience. For instance; if I had the Grand Turk in my power, as he has been accustomed to a soft and effeminate way of living, it would be hard to put him all at once to maul rails, or clearing out meadow ground, or the like; or if it should fall in my way to have Catherine of Russia in that capacity, as she is a women of an elevated mind, it would be inhumane to put her to the lowest drudgery, such as scrubing out rooms, and carrying water from the pump; but rather indulge her if I could afford it, with a more easy employment, especially as she is an old woman, of knitting stockings and carding wool. There is no man would be more disposed to treat a slave with tenderness than myself; but to deny me of my right altogether of making one, or of trafficking for one when made, is carrying the matter too far. So much for the right of enslaving. But if we put it on the principle of what will conduce to the aggregate happiness of mankind, we shall find it to be, that there should be master and servant, or in other words, owner and slave. The economy of nature illustrates this, in the subserviency of one thing to another: But, independent of any illustration, it must be known on reflection, and is felt in experience, that all are not competent to all things; and in the case of temporary servants, much time is taken up in contracting with them for their remanence; and it is a considerable time before they get into the habit of our service; and having it in their power to retire from us, when inclination may direct, there is an insecurity in the attachment. But as the slave has the master always to provide for him; so master has the slave always to subserve him: and thus, by a conjoint interest, the felicity of both is promoted, and the sum of human happiness increased. Hence it is, that most nations have made use of slaves. The patriarch Abraham, had threescore and ten servants born in his house. What were these but slaves? The Jews, his descendants, had bond-men, and bond-women: Were not these slaves? The Roman slaves were more in number than the citizens; and amongst the Greeks, the most virtuous of them, viz. the Spartans, kept in their service the most depressed of all slaves, the Helotes; who, when we consider the black broth, the food, and severe life of the masters, must have lived on poor fare, and in a laborious service indeed. But it may be said, that example of wrong never constitutes right. Grant it; but if you examine the capacities, and even inclinations of men, will you not find, that some are qualified only to be slaves. They have not understanding to act for themselves. Nor do all love freedom, even when they have it. Do not many surrender it; and prefer kissing a great man's backside, to being independent? It is not always, even from the views of advantage, that men are sycophants; but from an abstract pleasure in being drawn into the vortex of others. There is a pleasure in slavery, more than unenslaved men know. Why is it, that, even after the convulsion of a revolution in a government, in favour of liberty, there is a natural tendency to slavery; and it finally terminates in this point. The fact is, a state of liberty is an unnatural state. Like a bone out of place, the mind, in an individual, or political capacity, seeks the condition of a master or servant; avoiding, as the particular Vol. II. K propensity may be, the one or the other. There cannot be a greater proof that this is founded in nature, than the common moral observation, that the greatest tyrants, that is, the worst masters, make the most abject slaves: And, vice versa, that the most subservient of mankind, when you give them power, make the worst use of it: All this because, in these cases, the persons are misplaced, and not in their proper stations. Julius Cesar made a humane generous master; but he would have made a very intriguing, troublesome valet de chambre. It would have been impossible to have got any good of him. On the other hand, Tiberius would have made an excellent hostler, and taken a beating, with as much resignation, as a house beagle, who is used to it. So that it evidently is the provision of nature, that there are materials of slavery; and the fault of those, whom she intends for masters, if they do not make slaves. But as it is difficult to determine, a priori, who are intended for slavery or freedom, so as to make a judicious distribution, things must take their course; and the rule be, catch, catch can; and every man have a servant when he can get one. It is in vain to be squeamish, and stick at colour. It is true, I would rather have a white person, if such could be got; as I prefer white to black; especially in the summer season, as being a more light and airy colour. Thy reasoning, said the Quaker, is more rhetorical than logical; and thy analogies of nature, and historical proofs, cannot so far oppress the light within, as to make me think, that it is given to thee, or me, to make slaves of our species. As to that, said the Captain, I am not clear that a negro is of our species. You may claim kindred with him, if you please; but I shall not. I shall not dispute that with thee, said the Quaker: for I perceive thee does not give credit to what the book says of the first man, and his descendants: But will thee not grant me, that the African, though not of the same stock, is, at least a man; that is of the human genus, though the species of the white and the black may not be the same; if so, hast thou more right to enslave him, than he thee? Grant it, said the Captain; for my reasoning tends to that, and resolves the right into the power. If so, said the Quaker, thee may be the slave in thy turn. Doubtless, said the Captain; and it is not of so much consequence who is slave, as that there be one. It is better that the foot be foot, and the head be head; but if there is a conversion, nevertheless, let there be head and foot. It is necessary that there be domination and subjection, in order to produce a compound improvement and advantage. You could see by the Quaker's countenance, that he thought the reasoning sophistical; but as he did not know very well what he could say more, he was silent. CHAP. II. Containing Remarks. IT is thought by some, the Captain was not serious in thus advocating the cause of slavery. Be that as it may, he omitted some serious arguments, that naturally present themselves on that side on which he reasoned: For instance, it strikes me at first blush, that there can be no moral wrong in catching a young African, and bringing him away from his own happiness to pursue ours. For if there were, is it to be supposed, that humane and just persons, would promote and support the evil, by purchasing such negro, or retaining him, and his offspring, when purchased. For, on the principle that the receiver is the thief, or, to speak more strictly, a thief, the purchaser of the African takes the guilt along with the possession; and, in the language of the law, every act of retainer is a new trespass. For the evil K 2 of the original act, if there be evil in it, cannot be rendered pure by the filtration of purchase, and retaining. So that the holder of the negro, in the tenth transmission, is an aider, or abettor, of the original act of taking; if I may use the word aider, or abettor, in a case of trespass; where, by the definition of the law, all who any ways concur in the act, and further it, are principals. The holder of a negro must, therefore, look back to that act which first made him, or an ancestor, a slave; and if he cannot justify this, he cannot justify the retaining him in servitude:—What a consequence must this be! There is no man that pretends to humanity, much less to religion, would be safe in being the possessor of a slave. The only way therefore to get rid of the difficulty is to justify, ab origine, traffic in all such property. That it is justifiable I have no doubt. Is there any religious denomination, except the fanatical people called Quakers, that have made it a term of communion not to hold a slave. In admitting to church privileges, I have never heard, of the question asked, Have you any negroes, and do you keep slaves? If it was a matter of conscience, would not conscientious persons themselves make it. The assemblies or synods of the Presbyterian church, or conventions of the Episcopal, in America, have said nothing on this subject. Is an omission of this kind reconcilable with the idea, that it is a natural evil, or a moral wrong. In the phrenzy of the day, some weak minded powers, in Europe, begin to consider what is called the African trade as a moral wrong, and to provide for a gradual abolition of it. If they will abolish it, I approve of its being done gradually; because, numbers being embarked in this trade, it must ruin them all at once, to desist from it. On this principle, I have always thought it a defect in the criminal codes of most nations, not giving licence to the perpetrators of offences, to proceed, for a limited time, in larcenies, burglaries, &amp;c. until they get their hands out of use to these pursuits, and in use to others. For it must be greatly inconvenient to thieves and cut-throats, who have engaged in this way of life, and spent time, and expended money, and run great risks in acquiring skill in their employment, to be obliged all at once to withdraw their hands, and lay aside picking locks, and apply themselves to industry in other ways, for a livelihood. The law of Pennsylvania on this principle, has provided for the gradual abolition of the slavery of negroes. For those who have got them could not do without them, no more than a robber could do without the money that he takes, being pressed by some great necessity to make use of that expedient to recruit his purse. All those therefore who have been originally taken from the coast of Africa, and deprived of liberty, or descended from such, and inheriting slavery, when recorded agreeably to the act in question, continue slaves, and for life, and their offspring to a certain period. But were we to entramel the case with political or moral doubts respecting the original right of caption, and subjugation, the difficulty would exist of reconciling it with natural right to hold a slave for a moment, even whether the law sanctioned it or not; in which case we should find it necessary to go as far as the fanatics in religion, and set our slaves free altogether. It is from not duly attending to this circumstance, that abstract reasoners talk of abolition; a doctrine which, however absurd, is becoming the whim of the day; and the phrensy seems to gain such ground, that I would not wonder if they would next assert that it is unlawful to use the servitude of horses, or other beasts of burden, as having a natural right, to live in the fields, and be as free as mankind. The best way to avoid extremes, is to check the principle; I hold the right of absolute subjugation, of whites, blacks, and browns of all nations, against gradual abolition, or any abolition whatsoever. This being the only consistent principle, short of an absolute emancipation, made instantly; for in no mean is there reason, or a rest for conscience. That it is of importance to settle the consciences of sober minded persons in Pennsylvania, clergymen, and members of the Presbyterian church especially, who have negroes, must be well known from that tenderness of conscience, for which such are remarkable. Some, indeed, carry their ideas of the extent of duties so far, as not to omit grace to meat, or the formal worship of prayer, reading chapters, and singing psalms, on the set occasions, on any consideration whatsoever; what is more, will not shave a beard, on the Sabbath day, for a cow. Now, should they, by any means, come once to think of the wickedness of enslaving men, there would be no getting them to keep a negro. For those of this denomination; and, indeed, most, or all others of the Christian, hold, that the Africans, though of a sable race, is of their own species; being descended from Adam. This being the case, a slight matter, the bare directing their attention to the subject, would alarm pious people, and lead them to the favourite maxim of the gospel—“Do to others, as you would have others to do to you.” As opposed to the enfranchisement of negroes, generally, and in Pennsylvania in particular, I have been under apprehensions, that some of our young lawyers in the courts, might plead the constitution of the state, by which it is established that “all men are born equally free and independent.” Now admitting that a negro is a man, how shall any master retain him as a slave? On a habeus corpus, he must be set at liberty. At least I cannot conceive how the judge could remand him to his drudgery. The constitution is the law paramount, and framed by a convention of the people, recognizing the original right of freedom in a negro, allowing him to be a man; and caries us above the act of the legislature for the gradual abolition, &amp;c. which by implication seems to suppose that negroes may be slaves:— An implication inconsistent with the power exercised by the law. For if negroes were slaves, and so the property of those who claimed them, could the legislature affect that property, without indemnification to the masters? I shall say no more on this head, lest I should furnish hints to pettifoggers, who may make an ill use of their information. CHAP. III. JUST at this moment a waiter coming in, told him there was a person without, that is, in the bar room, who wished to speak with him. Going out, who should strike his optics, but Teague. The fact was, being elated with the success of his performance on the stage, attributing that to art which was nature itself, he had counted more upon his accomplishments than he ought to have done, and had made advances to the mistress of the manager, who was also an actress, and not greatly coveting an amour with the bog-trotter, made a merit of the circumstance, to induce an opinion of fidelity, and informed the manager of the presumption of the Irishman. The manager in the most unbecoming manner, without either citation, examination, trial, conviction, or judgment, but laying aside all forms of law, had instituted an original process of himself, and laying hold of a horse-whip, had applied this implement to the back and shoulders of Teague, and as the Irishman made an effort of resistance at the first onset, the manager had been under the necessity, by turning the but end of the whip, to knock him down, which he did by a stroke above the left eye-brow, which not only bereft him of senses for the present, but a discolouration of the eye for some days, and a scar probably his whole life after. It was this incident had induced him to leave the theatre, and brought him back to the Captain, whom he now accosted in the following manner: Dear master, for the love of shalvation, forgive a poor sharvant that has been killed this marning with a great cudgel, just for nothing at all, but not plasing a damned whore, that wanted me to stale the manager's cloathing, and go off wid her. This is all that a poor sharvant gets by being hanest; but by shant Patrick, and the holy crass, it is what I deserve for leaving the sarvice of a good master, as your anour, and taking up with bog-tratters, and stage players, that would sooner take a cup of wine than the holy sacrament, and get drunk every Vol. II. L night in de wake, and go to de devil head foremost; but if your honour, dear master, will forgive the past, and my running away, and laving you, I will come back again, and sarve you to the day of judgment, or any langer time that your honour plases, and clane your boots and spurs, and rub down the bay harse; the poor old crature, how aften I have tought of him when I was in my rambles and he was a slape, laste they should chare him of his oats, and give him nather hay nor straw to ate; for I always liked to take care of a good harse, and a good master; and aften tought of your honour, when I was among the bog-tratters of the stage, and gave you a good name, and was always talking of you and forgot my part, and put the managers in a passion, who fell upon me, and bate me like a dog. The Captain saw the inconsistency in the relation; one while alleging the tale bearing of the mistress, as the occasion of it; again, a deficiency in the recital of his part; but expecting no truth from the Irishman, cared very little how it came to pass. The principal thing that occupied his thoughts, was whether to receive the bog-trotter, or dismiss him. He reflected with himself on the trouble he had had with him, on his various pretensions to advancement; his uneasiness of mind, and fatigue of body, for several days past, in examining stews, methodistical conventicles, rumaging philosophical societies, attending elections, and listening to the debates of Congress, to see if he could any where observe his physiognomy, or distinguish his brogue. He could not think of subjecting himself to such uncertainty in the attendance of any servant, with such preposterous ideas, as being a legislator, philosopher, &amp;c. Again, he considered, that probably this last chastisement he had received, might have a good effect, in curing him of the freaks of his ambition; and a mind broken and reduced by disappointment, is in a mellow state, and more capable of receiving the seeds of good advice, than a mind full of vanity or pride, that has never yet received blows. Deliberating on these grounds, his humanity prevailed, and he determined to receive the raggamuffin into favour. This being settled, and learning from the Irishman in what manner he had been inveigled, and drawn away by the manager, to go upon the stage; and that it was only because Teague had made advances to a woman that was a whore already, that the manager had made such an attack upon his person, he wished to punish him, if it should appear to be within the province of the law to do it. Accordingly, inquiring what principal lawyer there was in that city, was informed of a certain counsellor Grab. Taking Teague with him, he set out to consult this gentleman. Counsellor Grab was in his office, amongst large shelves of books, or shelves of large books; not, as the Latins say, Co-opertus, aut obrutus, sed comitatus libris; that is, In the midst of his books. He had on a pair of spectacles, not so much on account of age, as to make the client believe that he laboured under a premature want of sight, from much reading; or, because a pair of lenses, magnifying the organs of vision, gives the appearance of a larger eye, which has a good effect on the person consulting, impressing the idea of a broader view of things that are before it. Entering, the Captain addressed himself to the counsellor, and gave him the outlines of the injury done to Teague; The counsellor, in the mean time, suspending his reading in a large book, which he had before him, printed in Saxon letter, and raising his head, until the glasses of his spectacles were brought to bear upon the physiognomy of the Captain. The Captain having finished his account, referred him to Teague, the subject of the battery, for a a more particular detail of the circumstances. Teague was glad of the opportunity of speaking before a learned lawyer, and was beginning to give a relation of the whole affair; but the Captain stopped him, bidding him wait until the lawyer should himself request him to begin. The lawyer was silent: after having reconnoitered with his glasses, one while the Captain, another while Teague, he dropped his optics, and began to read again. The Captain, thinking he had not been sufficiently understood, recommenced the narration, and gave an account of what he himself had suffered from the inveigling and detaining his servant, and the visible injury which the servant himself had sustained. The lawyer was still silent; and, though he had eyed him while speaking, as a Tuscan astronomer would the moon, yet he applyed himself again to the reading the black letter, that was before him. L 2 The Captain thought it strange treatment; and was, for some time, at a loss to know what to think of the matter. But recollecting, opportunely, that the circumstance of a fee had been omitted, he took out his purse, and threw down two dollars. The lawyer seemed a little moved, but cast his eye again upon the black letter. Finding the two dollars not sufficient, the Captain threw down two more. The counsellor raised his head from the book, and you might discern some dilitation of the muscles of the face, as bespeaking an approaching opening of the voice; but still there was silence; and might have been to this hour, had not the Captain recollected, at this moment, what he had all along forgot, that half a joe was the fee of a lawyer. Doubling, therefore, the four dollars that were already down, the lawyer came to his voice, the organs of his speech were loosed, and taking the glasses from his eyes, he gave his counsel as follows: Said he, You have a double remedy in this case; against the manager who inveigled, and against the servant himself: Against the servant, on the act of Assembly, if indented; at common law, on the contract to serve. For even a servant at will, and not engaged for any special time, is not at liberty to desert the service of his master, without reasonable notice first given. So that you may have your remedy against the servant, in the first instance, by bringing the matter before the court of quarter sessions; and having time put upon him, as the phrase is, for this dereliction of your service; or, an action on the contract, express or implied, as the case may be, wherein he shall repair, in damages, the loss sustained. The bog-trotter was alarmed at the idea of an action against him; and looking wistfully at his master, exclaimed; Dear master, will you trow de law upon me, dat am as innocent as a shild unborn; and would go to death and damnation for you. Dear master, I suffered enough by de cudgel of dat player, for all de running away I have done; and, God love your shoul, keep de law in its own place, and not let it come acrass a poor sharvant, that has nathing but as he works and trats about; but let dese grate big books of his honour de lawyer, spake to de manager, for his deceiving a poor sharvant, and putting it in his head to run away, and lave a good master; and his beating him with a grate cudgel into the bargain. I have no desire, said the Captain, to pursue the bog-trotter; as he has made acknowledgments for his fault; but would want the utmost rigour of the law to be put in force against the player. You have also in this case a double remedy, said the counsellor; by prosecution on the part of the servant, and on your part. Nay, the servant himself has a double remedy; for he may prosecute by indictment, or bring his action of assault and battery; or both. I would recommend the action only; because, where no indictment is prosecuted, and the civil action only brought, exemplary damages may be given, as well as reparatory. For in the civil action, it will affect the minds of a jury, that the party has already suffered all that is in the nature of punishment by a criminal proceeding; and nothing remains with them, but to give reparatory damages. On the part of the master, two kinds of action may be brought; either an action of trespass, vi et armis, laying a perquod servitium amisit; or simply an action on the case, for the consequential damage of inveigling the servant. As to the number of remedies said the Captain, or the kind of them, I care very little how many there are, or what they are; I want only a good remedy; give me a good swingeing one against the rascal, and I care very little what it is called. I shall then, said the counsellor, advise simply an action on the case; and count generally on the inveigling, and detaining, and rendering unfit for service while in his power. In this mode, the whole circumstances of the injury may be brought together, and summed up into one point of view; and enhancing the quantum of damages, can expatiate on the value of your servant, and the special occasion you had for his service, at this particular juncture; for I make no doubt he is a valuable servant; and that it has been an almost irreparable injury to you, to have been defrauded of his service at this time. As to his value, said the Captain, there can be no doubt, not only as a servant, but in other respects. I have been offered, or at least I suppose I could have got, an hundred pounds for him, to be a member of Congress, or to preach, or to go to the Philosophical Society, or to be an Indian treaty-man; but have refused every proposal made him, or me, for these purposes; and now to have him kidnapped, and taken off, without fee or reward, and employed as an actor, and beat, and rendered useless, at least for some time, into the bargain, is too much for any man to put up with. If there is law in the land, let it be put in force; and this man made an example. The counsellor had no need of spectacles, to give himself the appearance of a glaring and broad look, on this occasion; for the words of the Captain made him stare sufficiently, without the aid of a magnifying medium, to enlarge his optics. He began to take him for a madman; at least, in some degree, deranged in his brain; to talk of his servant being in request for a member of Congress, and the like. Yes, continued the Captain, he not only inveigled away a servant, that was thought fit to be a member of Congress, and a preacher, and an Indian treaty-maker, and a philosopher, and what not; but has kept me, these three days, trotting after him, and trying to find him, at election places, and in Congress boarding-houses, and the hall where they have their debates, and churches, and pulpits, and chambers of philosophical societies, and professorships, and where not; to see if I could find him; while this manager had him, in the mean time, at rehearsals, teaching him the art of mimickry, for the stage. The counsellor, in the mean time, had reflected with himself, that, whether madman, or no madman, the Captain had money, and might be a good client, let his cause be what it would; and so composing the muscles of his face, seemed to agree with him; and observe, that doubtless the quality and capacity of the servant would be taken into view, in estimating the damages: That, if it appeared he was not only fit stuff for a servant; but to be advanced to such eminent offices as these, not only the inveigling the embryo legislator, preacher, and philosopher; but the assaulting and beating him, and, by that means, disabling him from immediate service, must be viewed in the light of an atrocious injury, and insure a verdict accordingly. Very well, said the Captain; and I shall wish to have the matter determined as speedily as possible, as I may be but a few days in town; and, besides, as the marks are yet apparent on the face, and, I suppose, back, of the bog-trotter, it will appear to the judges, and jury, without the trouble of witnesses, what damage he has sustained. The process of law, said the counsellor, is tedious, but certain; you cannot expect a trial, in this case, until the 3d or 4th term; that is, nine months, or a year. How so, said the Captain? Because, said the counsellor, it is now two months, or upwards, before the court to which the writ will be returnable. Even if a declaration is then filed, the defendant may imparl until the succeeding term, which is three months; when if there is no demurer general or special, a rule to plead will be taken, which may not be put in until the succeeding term of three months again: At this term, if there is no replication, rejoinder, surrejoinder, rebutter, or surrebutter, to draw up and file, while the defendant may crave a term, issue will be joined, and at the next term trial. But even after a verdict, there may be the delay of a term, on a motion for a new trial depending; so that in the law there is delay; but this delay is the price of justice. It is a price, said the Captain, that I will not give for it. If you will bring it about in a short time to have this fellow flogged, even with half the stripes he has given my servant, I shall not think the half joe thrown away; but to be a year or half a year about the business, is putting the matter so far off, that it may as well be omitted altogether. If you could only get him sentenced to take a kick or two from my foot, or Teague's, before we leave the city, I should be satisfied. The lex talionis, said the counsellor, makes no part of our law. You can punish only in estate, not in person, for a simple assault and battery, as this is. Do you not hang a man for murder, said the Captain; and why not punish personally for an assault and battery? Because it is our law, said the counsellor; and, in a civil action, the object is damages. A civil action, and damages, are strange phrases, said the Captain; how can civility and damages, be reconciled. These are technical terms, said the counsellor, which persons, not of the prosession, are at loss to understand; but Vol. II. M have, in themselves, a distinct and sensible meaning. Let the terms mean what they will, said the Captain, it all comes to this at last— There is no getting at the manager, under a year, or two year's race for it; before which time, Teague will have forgot the abuse he has received, and I my trouble in running after a strayed Irishman, through this city; and, therefore, it may be as well to give the matter up, and sit down with the loss. That as you please, said the counsellor; and putting on his spectacles, cast his eye again upon the black letter. The Captain, without bidding him kiss his backside, beckoned to Teague to follow him, and withdrew from the chamber. Having retired; Teague, said the Captain, this thing of law has been well said to be a bottomless pit. The way to it is like that to the shades; —Facilis descensus averni; Sed reserre gradus, hic labor, hoc opus est. This pettifogger seemed to have a thousand remedies at his command, and yet none that would serve us; as the redress, if any, is to be postponed to such a distant day. I have heard a great deal of these cattle, and I believe they are best off that have least to do with them. They have so much jargon of technical terms, that the devil himself cannot understand them. Their whole object is to get money; and, provided they can pick the pocket of half a joe, they care little about the person that consults them. The first loss is the best; you had better put up with the currying you have got, than have my pocket picked, on pretence of redress a year or two hence, which may, perhaps, prove a century. Teague was contented to put up with the drubbing, and have no more said about it. CHAP. IV. THE Captain had consoled himself with the idea that Teague was now cured of his folly, and would no more be disposed to entertain notions of ambition, and unreasonable projects. He was disappointed in his hope; for that very evening, the Irishman washing down the recollection of his woes with some exhilerating drink, and though not intoxicated, but enlivened only, he came to the Captain: Said he, Dear master, what would your anour think, if a poor sharvant should turn lawyer; and get a half joe when a customer comes to consult him in the morning? would it not be better than currying a horse, and tratting about like a big dog; with no sense to live like a man of fartune, and have a big house over his head, and books about him, and take half joes from paple that come to him about their quarrels and batings, through de town, and sending dem aff as wise as if dey never had come to him, and de great spectacles, to look like a blind man, dat was blind before he was born, and could see more than two or three other paple, for all dat; and was a canjurer, and a wizzard, and could take money for nating. Would it not be better, master, than tratting like a fool, and disputing wid paple, and having nating to lay up; but be as poor as a church mouse, or a rat, all the days of our life, and paple laugh after us when we are gone. The Captain was thrown into a reverie of thought, by the speech of the bog-trotter; reflecting, that his presumption and folly was incurable; for, notwithstanding all that had been said to him, or suffered by him, his natural propensity remained the same; according to the maxim— Naturam expellas bufurca, usque recurret; You may toss out nature with a pitchfork, she will still come back upon you. Not so much from any further view of reclaiming him, as from indignation, and resentment, against his presumption, the Captain projected, in his mind, a farther means of chastising him. He had heard of a work-house, in this city, into M 2 which refractory servants are committed, and put to hard labour; such as pounding hemp, grinding plaister of Paris, and picking old ropes into oakum. He resolved to have the raggamuffin put into this a while. Counterfeiting, therefore, an approbation of his project of becoming lawyer, doubtless, said he, the profession of the law is a profitable business, where money is very easily got, by the bare breath of the mouth. Nevertheless, it requires time and study to qualify for this profession. Nay, the introduction to the study, by being put under an eminent lawyer, in full practice, is itself very expensive. An hundred pistoles is sometimes the fee. This I could not very well afford; but I have an acquaintance in this town, who, I am persuaded, would be willing to oblige me, and will take less. I will call upon him early to-morrow, and settle the contract. Accordingly the next day, calling on the keeper of the work-house, he gave him an account of his refractory servant, and with a gratuity of a couple of guineas, obtained his consent, to take the bog-trotter under his direction, and give him a few lessons in picking oakum, and grinding plaister of Paris, and pounding hemp, not withholding, in the mean time, a seasonable application of the cowskin, in the intervals of study of these several branches of the law. For the idea was to be imposed upon Teague, that this was an office, or as it were an inn of court, or chamber of the Inner Temple; and that the several flagellations, and grindings, and poundings, were so many lessons, and lectures, to qualify him for the practice of the law. It happened, fortunately, that the keeper of the work-house was well qualified for the task; for, in early years, he had been put an apprentice to an attorney, and had some opportunity of attending courts, and hearing the names of books to which the advocates referred in their pleadings; but having a turn for extravagance, and a dissolute manner of life, he had come to poverty, and, through various scenes, to jail. There, by address, he had gained the good will of the jailor's daughter, whom he married; and, by the interest of his new father-in-law, having obtained his liberation, he was, from acting as deputy jailor, in a series of time, at length promoted to be the keeper of this work-house. Indeed, from his employment, being acquainted with the prisoners, and finding himself sometimes interested in their fate, and being led to attend their trials, he had, even in his last capacity, been a good deal about courts, and heard law phrases and books mentioned. Accordingly, when Teague was introduced, which was that very afternoon, he had, at his command, the names of the abridgers, and reporters, and commentators of the law, and the technical terms in the commencement and process of a suit; so that, when the key was turned, and, after having stript him of the linen doublet that was upon him, he began to give him the first application of the cowskin, he told him this was reading Wood's Institutes; and when, after this, he was sentenced to an hour or two's hard labour, at grinding plaister of Paris, this was called Coke upon Littleton; and when the employment was varied, pounding hemp, or picking oakum, it was called Hawkin's Pleas of the crown, or Foster, or 4th Blackstone, &amp;c. When the poor bog-trotter, reduced to a skeleton, living on bread and water, complained of the hard usage, and offered himself a servant for life, to curry horses and brush boots, to any Christian creature that would take him out of that place; he was told, that, as he had begun the study of the law, he must go through with it; that that was but the commencement of the suit; that in a year's time he would learn to file a declaration; in another, to put in a plea; in a third, to join issue; and in a fourth, to conduct a trial; that unless a bill of exceptions had been filed, or there was a motion, in arrest of judgment, or a writ of error brought, he might be admitted the fifth, and begin to practice the sixth year: At all events, provided he would submit himself, with due application, to fasting, and cowskinning, and grinding plaister of Paris, pounding hemp, and picking oakum, he might be a lawyer the seventh year, and wear spectacles, like counsellor Grab, and take half a joe when he thought proper. I know not by what simile to represent the howl of the Irishman, at this prospect of the duration of his woes. It was like that of a wolf at the bottom of a well, or a dog that had lost his master, or a cow her comrade, or some forlorn wanderer that has missed the way, and given up all hopes of being extricated from the wilderness. At the various applications of the cowskin, he had jumped, and cursed, and swore, and prayed, and beseeched, and promised a thousand services, of currying horses, and brushing boots, and trotting where ever he was ordered, provided they would set him at liberty. When employed at the hard labour, before mentioned, he had groaned, and cursed the law, the counsellor, and the half joe. Ah, thought he, if my dear master, the Captain, knew how hard a ting it was to study law, and to fast widout ating or drinking, and be bate wid a cow-skin, he would not have given the hundred pistoles, nor the half of it, to have had me kicked and cuffed in dis manner: I would give body and shoul into the bargain, if I could see him once more at that iron gate there, to spake to him, and besache him to take me out of this purgatory. He was a good master; and when I was a fool, and wanted to be a member of Congress, and prache, and be a phalosophar, he told me, Teague, you are a fool; and what they would do wid me there; how they would bate me, and ate me, and take de skin aff my back, and make a cow or a shape od me; and now I am worse than a cow or a shape, or a horse in de tame; for I am cut, and curried, black and blue; till my flesh is raw, and a cholic in my belly, wid fasting; and all to stoody dis law. The devil take counsellor Grab, and de half joe. CHAP. V. THE Captain having been led to think so much of law, of late, was struck with the idea of visiting courts of justice, and hearing some of those cases argued, which come before them. Understanding that a court was then sitting, he resolved to take the opportunity of the interval of Teague's purgation, in the workhouse, to amuse himself with the pleading of the advocates. Accordingly, repairing to the court house, he took his place amongst the crowd, and listened to what was going forward. What came before the court was a motion in arrest of judgment. A Jonathan Mun had been indicted, and found guilty of “feloniously taking and carrying away water out of the well of Andrew Mab.” It was moved in arrest of judgment, that larceny could not be committed of water in a well, it being real property; for it was a distinction of the common law, that larceny could not be committed of things real, or savouring of the realty, Black. 232. 2 Ray. 470. Hawkins, &amp;c. So that taking away the soil was merely a trespass; and taking away the water could be no more. It was answered, that water being fluitans, et mobilis, could not be considered as real property; that an ejectment would not lie for water, but for so many acres of land covered with water, Yelv. 143. 1 Burr. 142. Because it was impossible to give execution of a thing which is always transient and running, Run. 36. quotes Cro. Jas. 150. Lev. 114. Sid. 151. Thence it is that in a grant of the soil it is necessary, as we see from old forms, to add the right of ways, woods, and water-courses, Lilly. Con. 132. and 179. Bridg. Con. 321. That whatever might be said of water in its natural bed on the soil, as water in a running stream; yet a well being dug by the labour of hands, the water thus acquired, must be counted as personal, not real property. Barbcray, Titius, and Locke. That at a well, the water being drawn up by the bucket, and thus by one act separated from the freehold, Vol. II. N and by another taken from the bucket, it becomes a subject of larceny; as in the law of corn, trees, or grass growing. For if these be severed at one time, and at another time taken away, it is larceny. Hawk. Pl. Cr. 93. It was replied, that an ejectment would lie of water in a well; for here the water is fixed in a certain place, within the bounds and compass of the well; and is considered as part of the soil. Run. 37. That, ex vi termini, in the indictment, “out of the well,” it must be considered as water ex, out of, or from the well; that is, water severed by the very act of taking; for otherwise it would have been expressed, by “water out of the bucket” of Andrew Mab; not out of the well; and so the taking could not be larceny, but trespass; as in the case of a tree that is cut down at one time, and taken away at another; or apples growing on a tree, or shaken down and gathered from the soil; the first being a trespass, the second larceny. Curia advisari vult. The Captain whispering to lawyer Grab, enquired what difference it made in the punishment, whether it was larceny or trespass? He was answered, that in the one case it was hanging by the common law, and in the other to pay the value of the property. A very material difference indeed, said the Captain, to depend on so nice a distinction.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">BOOK VI. CHAP. I. THE Captain had now leisure to reflect on the predicament in which he left Teague; and thinking he might have had what was sufficient to cure him of his folly, or at least restrain it, thought of making a visit to the house of employment, or sending to liberate the valet. This thought running in his head, he naturally suggested it to a gentleman with whom he was, at this time, in conversation, on indifferent subjects; the gentleman lodging at the same inn, or public house, and seeming to be a person of considerable shrewdness and discernment, not only of the affairs of men in general, but of the special spirit and character of these times. Said the gentleman; The folly of your man has certainly been very great, to suppose, that he could be qualified to sustain the profession of an advocate, and to practise law: For, though in this, as in most other professions, “the race is not always to the swift, nor the battle to the strong;” but the people that sheweth favour; that is, take up an opinion of abilities, where there are none; yet your servant, having so little, even of the semblance of qualification, it would be counting too much on the circumstance, to promise great success in his case. His prospect of advancement would be much more certain in the political career. You seem, by your account, to have discouraged him in taking a feat in the legislature; and would not wish now to contradict yourself: yet why not indulge him in taking a place in the executive of some government. As far as I see, with that ambition which is natural to him, you will find him but of little use, as a waiter; and you may as well let him do something for himself, as not. If appointed in the department of finance, he can use clerks; and, in a very short time, he may learn to write his name, so as to give his signature to any paper; and this, with the help of clerks to do the accountant business, would be sufficient: At least, there have been those in these departments, who have been approved, and yet could do little more. Should he even become a governor; furnished with a secretary, he can be at no loss to compose his messages, or other communications, to individuals, or public bodies. But what I would propose, and will suit him best, will be to go into the general government; and, under this, the diplomatic line will be eligible. He might be appointed consul to the port of Cork or Dublin; or the Barbary States; or other places: Or he might go as ambassador to the grand Mogul; or envoy extraordinary to the king of England; or other princes or potentates in Europe. If you should think of favouring him in this career, it will be necessary for him to appear at the levee of the president, that he may be introduced with a certain gradual etiquette of advancement. What! said the Captain; introduce a ragged bog-trotter to the president of the United States! Not ragged, said the gentleman; you can have a pair of breeches made for him; and put shoes upon his feet: a sword will be necessary; and some other articles of equipment. And when you bring this into view with his making his fortune, you will not consider it as advancing much for a person whom you wish to serve. The Captain began to think there was weight in the observations of this gentleman; and that it might be proper to let the bog-trotter have a chance of doing what he could: Accordingly, he wrote a note to the keeper of the house of employment, to liberate him for the present. The state of politics at this time, and the prospect of Teague's advancement, we shall leave to the Third Volume of this work.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">POSTSCRIPT. IT is well for men in office, that my pen has taken this turn; and that I employ myself in writing harmless nonsense, rather than strictures on their conduct In the case of the famous Gordon, who, with Trenchard, was an author of what were stiled Cato's Letters, it is well known that the shrewd minister of that day, Walpole, dreading the effects of these writings, wisely laid a plan to free his administration from them; by affecting to admire the stile; and saying, that it were a pity so noble a genius were not employed in giving a sample of good language, where there would be no occasion to invent, but merely to clothe ideas. For this reason, he would consider it as a great happiness, could he be induced to translate some work of merit; and give it in the beautiful garb of his expression. By this address, and the addition of a pension, the author was induced to undertake the translation of Tacitus. Now, what government, with great art, got Gordon to do, I have done of my own accord; that is, to amuse myself in abstract composition; regarding words only, and letting men of place alone. Nevertheless, as the sale of these is not certain; and if I should find it an expense, rather than a profit, to proceed in the work, I may quit it, and fall foul of the public measures, those who discharge the public trust, at the present time, may not be altogether safe. It were, therefore, wise policy in such, to assist the sale as much as possible; and it might not be amiss, in the first instance, to buy up, each of them, a number of copies I do not know that I have any thing to say of the president of the United States; or that I would say it, if I had; nevertheless, it might not be amiss for him, on the principle of preservation, and, agreeably to that universal prudence he has ever shewn, to take a few; perhaps 50 might suffice. The secretary of the treasury, and the secretary at war, might take, between them, about 500. As to the secretary of state, he is such a skin-dried philosopher, that an author would make as little out of him, as a fly would out of a weather-beaten bone; and so, it is of little consequence to him, whether he buys one at all; for I believe I shall not trouble my head about him. As to the Congress that have sat since the adoption of the federal constitution, they need not put themselves to the expence, individually or collectively, of purchasing one pamphlet; as I am determined not to be bought off by them; but in a work which I shall by and by publish, will canvass, freely, the respective demerit of their votes. I have not yet written any of this work; but I have it all in my mind; and if I had a ready amanuensis, to take it down, could give a volume in a short time. The whole gradation of officers and place-men, under government, are a good deal in my power. Not that I would descend to attack them; but I might affect the system by which they are supported. A pretty liberal purchase, therefore, on their part, might be money not ill laid out. The men that are upon the government of Pennsylvania, would find their account, in making it worth my while to let my fingers run in this way, a while longer. Peream ne scribam; I must write; and if I should break out upon them, I know not where I might end. The End of the Second Volume.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">INTRODUCTION. Proceeding with my object; the giving an example of a perfect stile in writing, I come now to the third volume of the work. I well know, that it will not all at once, and by all persons, be thought to be the model of a perfect stile, for it is only the perfectly instructed, and delicately discerning that can discover its beauties: and perhaps none will be more apt to pass them by than the learned of the academies, and the most versed in grammar rules of writing, for there is a greeness in the judgment of the school critics with respect to what is simple and natural in composition. To illustrate this by anology. Let a dancing master pass his judgment on the movements of the best bred man in life; and not finding in his position and attitudes, an evident conformity to the lessons of the salatory art, he will conclude that he has not been taught to move with propriety. He does not know that it is this very circumstance that constitutes the excellence of the movements of the easy and perfectly genteelman; to wit, that when you observe him, it will never once come into your mind that he thinks of his attitudes or positions in the least; but that every movement is just as it happens, and without any intention on his part. Ars est celare artem. To wit; It is the secret of good taste and perfection in behavior to conceal that you ever think of it at all. So it is the most perfect proof of a good stile, that when you read the composition, you think of nothing but the sense; and are never struck with the idea that it is any otherwise expressed than every body would express it. That stile, is not good, where it appears that you have not dared to use a word without thinking a long time whether you ought to use it; that, in the disposition of words, you have carefully studied which ought to go first and which last; and, that your sentence has a cadence which could not come by chance; but is the effect of design and art. I acknowledge that no man will ever write a good stile that has not well studied, and exercised himself in writing, selecting with a most perfect delicacy, in all cases; the proper term; but he must go beyond this, and be able to deceive the world, and never let it come into their heads that he hath spent a thought on the subject. But it is not one in five hundred that is born with that sensibility of nerve as to be able to attain with the help of great instruction and practice, a perfect judgment in the use of words. It is for this reason that I am ambitious of the praise of writing well so far as respects language. For it requires no uncommon structure of nerves, or organization of the brain to produce good sense; the mass of mankind is equal to this. Language, as it is the peculiar gift, so it is the highest glory of our species; and the philologist is to be considered as cultivating the most useful and ornamental of all arts. Pursuing therefore solely the use of words, I do not descend professedly to think of sense; nevertheless, if at any time there should be found ideas that have some consistency and meaning, they may deserve attention, as much as if it was the primary object of my work to express them; for it is not their fault if I set little store by them, and think more of the dress that I put upon them than I do of themselves. I am happy to find that in the review of this publication, given in Young's magazine, my ideas of the merit of the stile, is recognized, and fully justified. And as my work may be well supposed, to have a much more extensive circulation, and to live longer than that miscellaneous performance, I have thought it not amiss, for the honor of the critics to extract some part of the observations which have been made by them, and which are as follows: “The author of the work before us, is H. H. Brackenridge, well known in the literary world for his treatise on the œconomy of Rats, a satirical composition, in which under the veil of allegory, he designates the measures of the federal government; as also for his history of Weazles, in which the same strokes are given to those at the helm of our affairs, in a different fable, and narration. In the present work which he entitles Modern Chivalry, he disowns the idea of any moral or sentiment whatsoever, and proposes stile only as the object of the composition. And to this object, in our opinion, he scrupulously adheres; for though on some occasions, there would seem to be a semblance of idea, yet this we must attribute to the imagination of the reader, just as in looking upon a plaistered wall, attentively for a long time, you will conceive the inequality of the surface, or accidental scratchings, to be the shape of birds and beasts, or the letters of the alphabet. Yet as reason in this case will correct the fancy, and bring to mind that there is really no character or image there, there being none intended; so on a perusal of the work in question, looking a long time for sense, you may at last conceive that you observe some glimmerings of it, yet when you recollect that you have it from the author himself that he means none, you will be sensible that it is nothing more than the accidental combination of words which has given this picture to the mind. Stile, then, which is his object, must also be ours, in our view of the publication. For, to give a simile; if a manufacturer of cloth, or a taylor that forms it into vestments, should come forward, and produce each his work, to be considered merely as to the manufacture, or making up, without regard to the materials of the woof and warp in the one case, or the wearing in the other, it would be absurd to enquire of these when nothing was proposed to you respecting them, by the artists themselves. Confining ourselves therefore to the stile of this performance, we observe, that it has what is the first characteristic of excellence; viz. Simplicity. This consists in the choice of the plainest and most familiar words, and in the arrangement of the words in their natural order. There is a great difference between a vulgar term, or phrase, and that which is common, and comes first upon the tongue, in easy and familiar conversation. It is the mistake of this distinction which leads some writers to avoid the phrase that any one would use, and seek out what is uncommon. Hence there appears a variation in the words they put upon paper, from those which they themselves would use in conversation. And why this? Ought not language to be precisely the same whether spoken or written. Perspicuity is the natural result of simplicity, and needs not to be laid down as a different characteristic. For can there be obscurity in that composition where the most familiar word is used, and that word put in its proper place. This brings to mind the definition of stile by Swift; “proper words in proper places.” There can be nothing more easy than the composition of our author, His writing savours of the skill of an artificer who after many years exercitation in his art, acquires a power of accomplishing his work by a habit of the fingers, independent of any application of the mind. So that while in the stile of others there is an appearance of exertion, here there is what a superficial observer would call carelessness, but which the sound critic will discover to be the result of a perfect mastery of all that relates to language. It is pretty generally believed that our stile has been constantly degenerating from the time of queen Anne, in whose reign flourished those immortal penmen, Swift, Addison, Arbuthnot, Tillotson, Bolinbroke. &amp;c. If the stile of Mr. Brackenridge is examined, and compared with those models, it will be found to be in the same pure, simple attic taste. We shall therefore not hesitate to recommend it as a restorer of all that is correct and beautiful in writing.” So far the reviewers. I have said that I was happy to find that these have had the good taste to find out what I myself had thought of the composition. But as I wish at all times to let the reader, into a knowledge of my real sentiments, I will confess that these are merely words of course with me, and that I was not happy to find my work praised in any respect; because I wished to have a quarrel with the critics; and this not because I love war, abstractedly considered; but because in this case I should have had an opportunity of shewing my polemic talents. Nay, expecting an attack, I had prepared a number of good thoughts in my mind, to be used in my contest with them. What is more I had actually written a copy of verses in the Hudibrastic rhyme and manner, for their use, in which I considered them as Muskitoes, or flies of some kind, that were troublesome to men; and though the occasion fails, yet there can be no impropriety in giving to the public those strokes of satire which lay dormant in my mind. As these would apply more particularly to an attack upon me; yet the essay being in general terms, it may appear without a particular circumstance to call it forth; merely as a specimen of what I could do had there been occasion for it. And the insertion will be excuseable, when it is considered how painful it is to be frustrated in what we propose as our pleasure. I have known a good man wish to have bad news true, merely because he had related them: and we may conceive a saint vexed at not finding a man dead, when he had digested a funeral sermon in his mind, and was ready to bury him. On this principle, therefore, and in spite of the critics, I will have my verses published: they are as follows: THE critic first possess'd the earth, And by his rules gave authors birth. You may be ancient: critic, hark! Were you with Noah in the ark? In what compartment were you seen? 'Mongst creatures clean or the unclean? The critic, sir's, the natural father Of every snifling, snuffling author; And when you nod or snore or sleep, We shly on posteriors creep, And rouse you to a bright exertion, Of all your faculties; you whoreson. How can there be idea of beauties, Unless the critic genius shew't-us? The angle of the sight obtuse, Can see no more than doth a goose, Whilst we with microscopic eye, Examine as you would a fly, See through the crevices of fancy, As far as human eyesight can see, Tell where there is or is not Grammar; What phraseology wants hammer— Or file to make the verse run smoother, Where sound is harsh, or term uncouther. I grant you see defects and errors, Of those in genius your superiors: The skin however smoothly curried, To a flea's eye is deep and surrowed. His optics may perceive a wart, That grows upon the unseen part, But for the beauty of the frame, It is above the ken of them— Thus critics tell that bard divine Has a rough word in such a line, Or that the sacred poem scarce Can bear the trot of such a verse, That feeble author in such sentence Has not the vis, the spirit intense, That Pegasus was lame when he rode, Over this or that dull period: They tell, but never felt the force, Of genius in his rapid course. What? did not Quintilian fully, Develope all the praise of Tully? And 'mongst the Greeks, the great Longinus, Who may be justly stil'd his highness, With critic judgment join the fire, Of Heaven itself? who can go higher? From your vile accusation whose's safe? Not even the elder scaliger Joseph, Who had a mind as big's a mountain, Could all defects and beauties contain, And shew'd that Homer was inferior, And Virgil hit perfection nearer. Have you the assurance sir to speak, Against the Roman worth and Greek? So much we hear I believe that no man's, Tongue is still of Greeks and Romans; For if dispute should rise past curing, Which way 'tis best to make our urine, And each should argue stiffly his way, All must give up, the Greeks piss'd this way. But there in modern times is Bently, Who sung of Richard Blackmore daint'ly. I grant it, critic, there's a thousand; The list beginning has nor knows end. They swarm in millions from the flood— The Hebrew critics first drew blood; And this is what is meant by Babel Where all were critics that were able. The Rabbin and the Talmudist, Fought hand to hand and fist to fist, About the pentateuch of Moses; Their tales, the wildest stuff, God knows is. If there has been some Grecian critic, Above the offspring of a seed-tic; Yet where is one in modern days Who can deserve that share of praise? For metamorphos'd down to vermin, Who can the various shapes determine. And small and great are prone to mischief, And every clan and sect has his chief. They swarm like Caledonian cluster, When the Mac Neils and Camrons muster; Or as when house wife spreads her sugar, With water mix'd, each insect bugar, Relinquishes pots, tubs and pails, And for the booty spreads his sails. Thus all the race of critics gather, Around the footsteps of an author, Bite through his overalls and stocking, And biting shins, you know's no joking. Who now a days fits down to write Uninterrupted by a bite? Unless he takes good care and puts on, A pair of leggins or has boots on. They say of Reynard who loves geese, That when oppress'd with swarm of fleas He takes in's mouth a lock of wool, And gradually retires to pool; The fleas by secret instinct led, Fly from the tail and trunk to head, With speed each mother's son of them goes To seek the promontory of nose, And when no more remains abaft, Fox shakes his head and leaves the raft. Who could find out by book or sermon, An equal way t' allude the vermin, Would merit a rich premium more, Than vers'd in philosophic lore, The member who dissects a glow-worm, To see if 'tis a beast and no worm, I wish some virtuoso won'd, Who natural history understood, Dissect a critic, shew his jaw teeth, Whether they are quite smooth or saw-teeth, Resembling butterfly or asp, Or sharp and pointed like a wasp; And by the grinders edge determine, Corn-eating or carnivrous vermin. I'd give, myself, a golden medal, To know if't has a brown or red tail, And whether when it moves it goes on An hundred feet or half a dozen; But many glasses must be ground out, Before these mysteries can be found out. I leave it to some great Linæus, Who may by this be fam'd as he was. The reviewers in Young's Magazine, may see from hence how well it was for them, though unfortunate for me, that they have dealt in approbation solely. The prettiest part of the history of any author, is his war with the critics; and as that prince's reign, seems uninteresting where we are not amused with sieges and battles, so the life of an author is dull and monotonous where we hear of no litigations with a Bavius, or Mævius, a Dennis, or a Colly Cibber. It is true I have heard one observation made, viz. that though my stile is excellent of the kind; yet it is but of one kind, and as Swift said of himself that he could never rise to the stile of an oration or a sermon, so it would seem to be the case with me, that I am competent only to that humble species of diction which suits the dissertation, but rises not to the swell of lofty oratory. It is true this is the stile I have used in the memoirs of the Captain; because it is the stile which suits simple narrative. Nevertheless, it is not with me as it was with Swift; and in this respect, I am his superior; for I can rise to the swell of the highest pipe of diction. And to evince this, I will here produce an oration delivered by me about two years ago, when I officiated in the capacity of Chaplain to the light infantry company of Pittsburgh. I produce it only as a sample of stile; for as to other merit I will not answer for it; and if the learned should not think it, in point of sentiment, worthy of my fame, let it be my apology that the company at whose call I was, and military discipline being strict, I was obliged to obey at a short notice; the company I say, having given me but about two hours warning, the composition bears the marks of haste, not having that condensation of sentiment which deliberation gives But of this let the public judge. I give it as delivered. The Oration. “What is the object for which a soldier justifiably draws his sword? the protection of personal and social right. This is comprehended under one word, LIBERTY. By this we are to understand the natural liberty of man, independent of government; or liberty in a state of society, and government. The first being but ideal, it is the last to which our thoughts are directed in the use of this word. What then is liberty? It is the enjoying under some form of government, an equality of rights: an equal right to speak, and an equal right to act: where no one can or dare arrogate a superiority of power or privilege. Who would not risk a life for such a blessing? Who would not immolate a hecatomb of foes who should dare to invade it. Cæsar; I admire thy talents, I praise thy virtues; but in the face of nations, on the height of the world, thou daredst to usurp a superiority over brave men. The soul of Brutus, or of Casius could not brook it; the soul of Cato or of Casta could not brook it; every Roman felt the insult, and approved the act, that took away thy life. When understood and felt, what are the charms of Liberty? When possessed and enjoyed, what are its effects: greatness of thought, and greatness of conduct. Can the vassal think nobly? Can the dependent mind act boldly? No, “there is a lion in the way,” and cowardice benumbs the faculties. Are mankind sensible of this? There have been those who have borne honorable testimony of it. Shall I give you proofs? I recur not to the academies to bring thence the sentiments of philosophic men. I depict not those who have fought for liberty. I give you the sense of a people who had enjoyed it; who had lost it, and who had been restored to it. Stating the occasion, I shall give it in the words of Plutarch. “Philip and the Macedonians had subdued the Grecian states. These calling in the Romans, submitted to their authority, and received garrisons in all their cities. Titus Flaminius, who commanded the Roman forces, beat the Macedonians, and reduced them to their own territories. The Grecian states were still enslaved, but had changed their masters. The Ætolians had thence taken occasion to ask them, whether it were not matter of much consolation that, though their chains weighed heavier, yet they were now neater and better polished than formerly? Whether Titus were not deservedly admired by them as their benefactor who had unshackled the feet of Greece and tied her up by her neck? Titus vexed hereat, made it his request to the senate, and at last prevailed in it, that the garrisons in these cities should be discharged, that so the Grecians might be no longer debtors to him, for a partial but entire favor. The Isthmian games were now renewed, and multitudes sat crowded in the theatre to see the exercises; for Greece, who of late days not only found respite from war, and was in full possession of peace, but entertained farther hopes of regaining her liberty, made holiday for it. As these were celebrating, silence was commanded by sound of a trumpet, and the cryer, stepping from amidst the spectators; made proclamation, that Titus Quintus, the proconsular general, having vanquished king Philip and the Macedonians, restored the Corinthians, Locreans, Phoceans, Eubæans, Achæans, Pthiotæans, Magnitians, Thessalians, and Perribæans, to their own country, laws and liberty; took off all impositions upon them, and withdrew their garrisons thence.” At the first, many heard not at all, and others did not distinctly hear what was said; but an odd kind of bustle and stir there was in the theatre, some wondering, some asking, some crying out to the cryer, “Repeat that again, repeat that again.” When therefore fresh silence was made, the cryer raising his voice, his speech more easily reached the ears of the company. The shout, which in that extacy of joy they gave, was so incredibly great that it was heard to sea. The people all jumped upon their legs; there was no farther regard to the diversions they came for, but all fell a leaping and dancing, and hugging one another; and all salute Titus with the title of saviour and defender of Greece. The strength there is in voices, and the many relations we have of the wonderful effects of it, were seen verified upon this occasion: For the crows that were then accidentally flying over the stage, fell down dead upon the shout. For the voices being numerous, and the acclamations violent, and the parts of the air separated from each other, they could no longer give support to the birds, but let them tumble; unless we should rather imagine these crows to fall and die, shot through with the noise as with a dart.” Are the present inhabitants of that country sensible of the value of liberty? They are not. They are enslaved by the Ottoman power. Could they be resuscitated to a sense of this magic word; this extatic sentiment, what would be their sensation? What the acclamation? The Theban, the Achean country would hear it, all Attica and Sparta would resound. The Ægean and Corinthian seas would tremble. Mount Olympus and Helicon would triumph. The Gods on the one, and the Muses on the other, would celebrate the festival. But O! Poetic and philosophie country, where my mind ranges every day; whence I draw my best thoughts; where I converse with the schools of wise men, and solace myself with the company of heroes, thou art lost in servitude, and great must be the revolution that can extricate thee thence. Let me console myself with the prospect of a nation, who, after more than a thousand ages of barbarian conquest and feudal tyranny, have emerged to liberty. It is France I have in view. O glorious people? Liberty descended not to you. But it is your acquisition. You have broke the fetters that enslave you, and tyranny has been put under foot. The legislative and judicial authority of your government has been rendered independent of your monarch, and the monarch reduced to a simple executive power. Shall the sovereigns of Europe conspire to reinstate him in his absolute dominion? Shall they hope to subdue a nation of brave men contending for liberty: Why do the heathen rage and the people imagine vain things.” Sooner shall the clouds of the atmosphere restrain the electric fluid, or the object struck upon resist the electric shock: Sooner shall the height of hills and the weight of mountains repress the caverned air, and earthquakes cease to burst, than the generous flame of liberty in this enlightened nation, can be extinguished and lost. Noble nation, you do us too much honor in saying that you drew from us the inspiration of liberty. You drew it from yourselves. The Montesquieus, the Rousseaus, the Voltaires, the Abbe Raynalls of your country. We felt the like spirit; and resisted the British power, and were aided by you in the conflict. May you enjoy that liberty which you assisted us to possess; may your example give that liberty to surrounding kingdoms which you yourselves enjoy. The mind contemplating the subject is enlarged, and travels from state to state, and from kingdom to kingdom hailing the voice of liberty. It is not in the nature of things that such a renovation should take place at once. But the day may not be far distant when Spain and Sardinia, Sweden and Russia, Germany and Poland may hear the voice of liberty; when Turky in Europe, and the islands of the Archipelago may hear the sound, and with an acclaim surpassing the Isthmean voice, convulse the heavens with the impulse. Pursuing the thought, what would be the effect of such a resurrection of the dead? The expression which I have incidently used has given me a simile. It would resemble the resuscitation of the dead at the last day, when the inhabitants of the earth recovering limbs and new bodies, shall raise their voice. Great will be their exultation; great their acclaim. They will shout, and with an emulation not unpleasing to the Almighty, struggle to surpass his yet resounding trump itself.” A copy of the preceding oration was sent by me to the Abbe Gochin, with whom I have been in habits of intimacy these forty five years, and was by him translated into elegant French. It was the perusal of this that brought me acquainted with the Jacobin clubs of that kingdom, and induced Mr. Claviers to make honorable mention of me at the bar of the assembly. The fact is, as may be seen from the oration, I possess great versatility of stile, and vast compass of sentiment and imagination. Nature intended me for a writer, and it has always been my ambition. How often have I sighed for the garrets of London; where I have read histories, manners, and anecdotes of Otway, Dryden, and others, who have lived in the upper stories of buildings, writing paragraphs, or essays in prose or verse. I have lamented my hard fate that I was not one of these. Was I to go to London, of which I have sometimes thought, my first object would be to visit the aerial mansions of these divine inhabitants. There is not a garret where any of these have dwelt, or where any of their descendents now dwells, that I would not rummage to find papers, scraps and remains, of what may be still there. I would at any rate visit most of the present men who live by their wits, and converse with them, indulging that pleasure which one takes in a consimilarity of genius. It was on this principle that the last time I was in the city of Philadelphia, I made enquiry of the booksellers, if there did not begin to be in that city some of these garret people? I was told by Dobson of a certain M`Comas, a Scotchman, that had come over about two years ago, and was in that way: that he had written paragraphs for the gazettes, and occasionally essays for the magazines; and that he lived in such an alley, I forget the name of it, but that he had not seen him for several weeks; and supposed he was engaged in preparing some work for publication. With the advantage of this hint, setting out, I found the alley, and by description, the house; when knocking at the door, an old woman opened it, to whom addressing myself, I enquired if Mr. M`Comas, the author, did not live there? He did live here, said the old lady, but about two weeks ago he died, and left me a quarter's rent unpaid, This is all a poor woman gets by lousy authors and such truck that keep writing night and day, and biting their nails, and mumbling to themselves, like witches or warlocks, that I was frightened out of my wits many a night, as he was tramping about in the garret over my head and talking to himself. I was struck with the undervaluing manner in which this old lady spoke of the author, and being in some passion, you old jade said I, are you not sensible of the honor done you in having a genius for your tenant; a man that with a single stroke of his pen could make you immortal. Ay mortal, said she, I am a poor enough mortal to want my quarter's rent, with his writings and fangles; I would rather have a person that would sit still, and hold his tongue, and sleep in my house, than a raving crazy brained creature like him, that made more noise than the rats, and was behind with his rent when he died, not leaving a pair of breeches or an old coat that would sell for the expence of burying him. By this time I had a little composed my mind, and suppressed my resentment, and told her I would pay her the quarter's rent for the honor of the cloth, if she would give me leave to visit the celestial mansion where the bard had resided. Accordingly, depositing the rent, which was two shillings and seven pence, I was permitted to ascend or rather climb up a ladder with broad steps of plank, to the habitation which was the second story, for it was a low building, with two apartments, the one on the lower, and the other on the upper flooring. The roof was low, and did not permit a tail man as I am, to stand upright on my entrance. Looking about, by the help of an opening in the weather-boarding of the gable end, I discovered a few papers, which I took to be manuscripts, lying in a corner near a kind of stool, with a board before it, nailed to the gable end, on which he used to write, and making a perquisite of these in lieu of my two shillings and seven pence, I descended: nor have I any reason to repent of my visit, or the sum paid, for amongst these I have discovered some scraps of great merit, and particularly a finished poem, of considerable length, with the title of Cincinnatus, in Hudibrastic verse; a kind of rhyme of which I am fond. I shall not, therefore, scruple here to insert the poem in this introduction, as a specimen of what this man's manner was. I know it will immediately be surmised by some, that the whole is a fiction, and that I myself have written this poem, and that the story of an author, &amp;c. is an invention to make it the more interesting to the reader, and to keep myself out of sight and behind the curtain; in the same manner, as Cervantes, in his Don Quixotte, pretends that his history is a translation from a Moorish writer, Cid Hamed, if I forget not; and the author of the Adventures of a Guinea tells us of his tracing the work to its repository in manuscript, from a single sheet which he found, if I remember right, wrapt round a pound of pepper which he had bought at the shop of a grocer. At any rate, though I may not be accurate, as to the last circumstance, yet I mean to say in general, that, as many writers of fictitious works, in order to give them an air of truth and reality; or to delight the reader by relating some accidental manner of coming at what was nearly lost, invent tales of finding shreds and scraps of compositions, and thence tracing to the source; or that by taking lodgings that had been before occupied by some poet or philosopher, they discover in an old trunk, or elsewhere, the lucubrations which they now offer to the public, so I may be suspected of adopting a common mode of introducing what I myself have written; but the fact is as I have stated. Indeed, upon the least reflection, no one would suppose that I could be the author of the poem; because, though it is but a playful satire, and those of the Cincinnati who are men of sense, would only smile at the performance, yet there are weak brethren, who might be offended; and I should not wish to have a sword run through my body, for all the pleasure that a little mirth gives. But as to the man that is dead, nothing can hurt him; and therefore there can be no danger in publishing what he wrote. The scheme of the poem seems to be, that of a member of the Cincinnati Society with the badge at his breast coming into a village, and the people of different descriptions falling in with him occasionally, and altercating with him respecting the demerits of the institution, and the propriety of the emblem which he wore. The introduction is as follows. CINCINNATUS. A Poem. What time the States had settled peace With adversaries over seas, And troops disbanded, it seem'd good, To institute a brotherhood, Among the chieftains of the war, Of Cincinnati character, Who now laid by their arms and came, To seek an agricultural fame--- On territory they had sav'd; For as together they had brav'd, The toils of service, wish'd a tie, At least upon the memory, Of that companionship; hence 'twas, The institution came to pass, Of a society and badge. At first it did provoke the rage, Of several of the citizens, As being savouring of designs, Of a nobility of title; And chevaliering here a little; And hence, when one of these in's gate, Came to a village of the state, With badge dependant at his bosom, It seem'd a singular rosy crozum, And drew attention and surmise; And every one that seem'd more wise, Began discussion of th' affair. A certain pedagogue was there, Did first accost, and ask'd the rise, And the intendment of device, And why he wore a turkey there, Effigies of a bird of the air, And other such interrogatories. The Cincinnat who heard the queries, Explain'd the history of the club, And effigy upon the bob; Vidilicet, that having fought, And put the adversar's to trot, Retir'd from war, like Cincinnatus, And were about to plant potatoes; But first in memory of their warfare, And individuals did most care for, Had set up club and wore a badge. And what bird have you in the cage, Quoth pedagogue? is it a goose, That you have chosen for your use? Or a wild turkey or a swan? This hurt the Cincinnati man---- Quoth he, I will not say you mean, T' affront, and throw out with design, This sarcasm on the badge we wear; For 'tis an eagle of the air, And emblematical of power, As having dominion of the lower, The fowls of the stack-yard and the grove; And hence become the bird of Jove, And is device upon the badge, Which you and other fools with rage, Decry and vilify and abuse, As being without sense or use; Because your ignorance is such, You cannot comprehend it much, The meaning of the hieroglyphic, Or motto that is scientific, Devis'd by scholars that were good, And authors of similitude. Quoth pedagogue, I own I saw It had a bird's tail and a claw; But never did so far encroach, To look distinctly on the broach Whether a grey goose or a drake, That gives himself i' th' roost a shake, But what resemblance is there here, To him of Roman character; Who wore no brochet at his button; Or a remarkable escutcheon; But when he quit the war and battle; Return'd t' his harrow and draft cattle, Without a goose-resembling bauble; Or other bird or beast, could gabble, A word of Latin or of Greek. But what the phrase it seems to speak? Relinquit omnia, servare Rempublicam; by the lord Harry, The Roman had not much to leave, And would have laugh'd himself in's sleeve, T' have had these words applied to him. And you that are of modern time, Were in the same predicament, Before were to the warfare sent; So that the point is not in this, From whence eulogium takes its rise, The having left a steer or two, Or an old horse with which did plow; But your returning to your place, When armies had been sent to grass; So that 'twere better you had made it, Nunc victor ad aratrum redit: Or some such phraseology, Designating the eulogy, Which really did belong to such, As not ambitious over much, Return'd from victory and war, To till their ground, and take the care, Of stock upon their farms; but wore, No other ensign than before, With barbarous Latin such as this, Assum'd for their hypothesis. Quoth Cincinnat, a great Quintilian, You are, and have read books a million; Can give a Latin word to teach us, Which way the Romans pull'd up breeches; Or how tobacco quid in cheek, Was turn'd by the enlighten'd Greek; You cough and grunt by syntax rules Drawn from the prosody of schools; But though I know not Cincinnatus, Or other Roman that begat us, The club nam'd after him is good And I could shew it if I would; But easier to dissolve the knot By slitting nose or cutting throat; Than talking about book or classic, And reading till it makes the eyes ach; For that my business is; this, yours; Which sophistry, a hanger cures. So say no more about the matter. Meantime with ignorance and ill-nature, There was a certain clergyman, That took upon him to explain, The meaning of the badge and use, By reading history of the Jews; Conceiv'd was an idolater, That from the eastern climes came there With native sparrow at his breast; Or what else bird it was express'd; Egyptian ibis or a stork, That did among the sedges lurk, In face of dictate that was given, By decalogue that came from heaven, Inhibiting the worshiping, Of graven bird or beast or thing; Or otherwise a great magician, He was, and dangerous on the occasion; For had a trinket of his own, And abracadrabra writ thereon, With some infernal spell or force, Above a common Christian's powers. The Cincinnat enrag'd to hear Attack upon his character, Addressed himself to the populace, Were then assembled at the place. Quoth he, though no great orator Experience being more in war, Yet sense of injury and wrong, May loosen word-strings of my tongue; Enable me to tell my tale In way, perhaps, acceptable; Especially as candour hears, As is evinc'd by your drop'd ears. For well aware that public lies, Insinuation and surmise, Had got the start of me, I fear'd, I would not be with candour heard. But to begin----'tis gone abroad, That I have image of false god, Hung at my breast; the effigy Of bird, or beast, or fish or fly; Which idol grav'd in bit of gold, Like the idolaters of old, I worship, and put up a prayer, Tho' but a wild fowl of the air. The clergyman has given rise, To this religious prejudice, As natural to every mind, To breed according to its kind; But nothing more dissimilar, Than that a soldier in the war, Should worship God at all, or beast, In effigy or shape express'd; For seldom worship the true God, Save when some danger comes the road; Unless the swearing by the Lord, Or zounds or zucks, or some such word, May be accounted reverence, Express'd to the Omnipotence; And therefore much less probable T' adore the visual beak or bill Of this small eaglet that I wear. As to idolatry am clear; For though know nothing more about, Religions that are set on foot Than a grey goose; yet catholic, Let all men worship till they're sick; Nor interfere with church or psalm, But be plain soldier as I am. You that compose my audience, Are persons of superior sense, And can with others set that right Misrepresented by the wight, And save my hard earn'd character, And the good name I wish to bear. There was a citizen just by, Who listened to apology. Quoth he it may not be the shape Of bird or beast at which you gape, For sake of reverence or of prayer; But to distinguish what you are; The only saviours of the cause; It being not the truth; whereas Are many others that have fought, And taken the Hessians by the throat, And may deserve more solid praise, Than wearing that small thing of brass, Unworthy even of you that chuse, To have the ensign of the goose. Is't not ridiculous that one, Who in the service has been known, As champion of a sober cause, Which with it such advantage draws As to secure our liberty, And place the thirteen stripes on high In this severe and ruggid clime, Should turn his thoughts to such a whim As savours of a ruder age, When every light-head wore a badge; And is no trophy or a spoil The warrior earn'd, upon the soil, But arbitrary honor made, By some one of the brazier trade; And is no special proof of worth; There are so many to hold forth. Pretension to the same device; For the peculiar honor lies, In being distinguish'd in desert. Are you the only that merit, In revolution brought about? Or are there not amongst the croud, Some others that have just pretence, If not with sword, at least with brains, To patriotism in the cause? If not with arms they have withjaws In councils of the several states, Or by their writings in Gazettes, Rebuff'd the British power and force And militated with discourse; And many who have spoke and wrote, Have also on occasion fought. And there are victims of the cause, By operation of the laws; In favor of the general good. What think you of the multitude, Reduc'd by fluctuating paper, Estates vanishing like vapour, And brought to beggary and loss: For take the people in the gross, And all have suffer'd more or less; And so may claim by services, At least a bit of lead or pewter, As their deservings are minuter, And institute a club or so, For what they did against the foe, In their particular grades and places; So that the multitude increases, To an infinity of badges; The honorary rights and wages, Of the whole bulk of citizens. In this there was but little sense, To which the Cincinnat replied, As having more reason on his side. Quoth he, it is a small affair, If at the period of the war, We instituted this our club, To recreate us after rub, And wear a badge which some arraign As visionary toy, and vain; But is not fancy that supplies, One half of things which are our choice; And all beyond the dress and food, Is but imaginary good? The cut, the colour of the garb Distinguishing the Jew from Ar'b; And all kinds of appendages, Of different tribes and nations dress Have their foundation in caprice; Not from necessity take rise. The savages that are untaught Do wear their honors at the snout; And nature sanctions the pursuit By giving feathers to the brute. The badge we wear is not a charm Of Physical or moral harm; But forcibly doth operate, And in the human mind create A love of fame and dignity, By having this before the eye; As, in the British isle, a star And Garter, is reward of war; And the St, Louis cross in France, In other places like advance: It is a small thing if from toil, Of summers sun and winters soil, Deficient in the stipend due, We wear a thing distinct from you, A trifling signet of our own, Shall scarcely cost us half a crown, Is there a law against the usage, Proscribing it as a surplussage; So that a writ of capias corpus Can have the virtue to disturb us, If there is neither rule of nature, Or jurisprudence that can deter, Why not just let the things go on, In the same channel 'tis begun? For though not great the excellence, Yet have there not been men of sense Among the Romans and the Greeks, That wore such things about their necks? A bull or button at the breast; Or elsewhere, that has well express'd, The signal honor they had won, By keeping adversaries down; Or saving citizen at least; And yet the thing not made a jest, By persons that have talk'd like you? Quoth citizen, it may be true; And also in the modern days, There have been found out many ways, To tickle fancies of the fools. There scarcely is a king but gulls, His courtiers with appendages, (At least when he is moneyless) Of title, or some silly badge With which they dance like birds in cage, Proud of a feather that is red, Or blue, because they take't in head, It does them honor with the prince; But here we have a little sense, In these United States, and hate, Such phantasy of a wrong pate; And wish t' have merit of our own, And not a mark to make it known, Hung up like sign at tavern door, Or barber's pole your nose before, Evincing what there is within, You could not other ways divine. Besides why do you quote the Greeks, Or Romans that had like dogs tricks? There is a difference in the case; For there, the people's suffrages, Bestow'd the honor that was worn; But here it would not serve your turn, But you yourselves assum'd device. Quoth Cincinnat, 'tis all damn'd lies; We took it up, 'tis true, but yet, It may be said the gift of the state, Because the honor was our right, And by deserving we came by 't. Be that as't may the thing is safe, And well befitting to the brave; Quite innocent in name and nature; Nor works a harm to single creature, Is neither error, nor a sin, T' offend a layman or divine. At this the clergyman spoke out, Who still was standing in the croud. Quoth he, have said, and say it again The thing is heathenish and vain, And wearer an idolater, Of whom there is just cause to fear, Being some false prophet come to light As is laid down in sacred writ, That fell deceivers would arise, In latter times to blind our eyes, And draw us from the truth we hold; For as to that same bit of gold, What use? unless simbolical, Of something bad and magical, With rhyme that is engrav'd thereon? If the mythology was known, It might be found it was that gog,--- And magog that has lain incog, So long in the apocalypse; And now emerging from eclipse, Has risen in such shape to men. The Cincinnat to him again: Quoth he, it ill becomes a priest, To travel from his sphere, and jest, About this trinket that I wear; Against it roaring like a bear, Who should be reasoning with the jew, Wherever he can find a clue; Or with the infidel, about, The devil's horns and cloven foot. Is this the knowledge that you gather, From every old and half dead father, As Chrystostom or Poly-carp, Who on a different string did harp; From you, about our institutions, Instead of prayers and absolutions, And teaching from the catechism, The origin of faith and schism: Which is unnatural and absurd, Deserves to be chastis'd and cur'd? For have you not an ample scope; Or as we say, enough of rope, To vent your rage and crudities, Against the errors that arise, Of fools that are propense to evil, And lay the fault upon the devil, As if he were a Jack o' lantern, In every whole and corner sauntering, Who never yet was out of hell, Or knew a single syllable, About the matter laid t' his charge, In pulpit oratory at large? I'st not enough to split your text: (Till every hearer's heart is vex'd) In forks and branches multiple, And firstlies, and so-forths at ill, With heads and horns of Daniel's ram, That in the prophet's vision came; Or bring a sermon out of what Has scarce the semblance of a thought, By twisting, turning, proper phrase; Or cloathing pristine nakedness, With commentaries of the brain, Which no man else could find therein? And have you not interminable, Career to run as fast as able, Through all the systems of the faith, And variations that it hath, Drawn from theology of schools, Or self-born of the preachers skulls, And built upon the abstract base; Which was originally much less: For so extensive is the flood, Of knowledge that is bad or good, A man may souse therein and toss, Just as in ocean would a goose, And find no shore or bottom out Of doctrines that are set on foot? Why then necessity to stretch, Your legs upon us at a fetch, As if you had not room at home To canter on your hypodrome, But must inveigh against what is But a mere symbol and device, And has no moral turpitude; Or meaning that is bad or good, Save just to shew the club we're of? Quoth preacher, it is well enough To put that face upon the matter, To keep the world from knowing better, Lest it should do your club a damage. But is it not an molten image Which the commandment hath forbidden? Quoth Cincinnat, are so priest-ridden That common sense has little place. It may be molten, to use phrase, But what of that, if not the use Is a new god to introduce, And worship semblance of a beast, Or bird that is upon the crest? It cannot give offence to Moses, Or hurt the decalogu's-proboscis, Or you that are conservators, Of all that in religion stirs. So that it is unnecessary, To make our club your adversary By thus misconstruing the badge, By inuendoes that engage The rabble to have prejudice. Quoth clergyman the matter lies Just here; the pagan deities, False gods in Egypt or elsewhere Did under some such shape appear; And even we read amongst the Jews They fell sometimes to this abuse; But chiefly worship'd calves and stocks; For which were given them sore rebukes. But paganism worship'd fowls, Eagles and pigeons and vile owls, Which you would imitate by this A sample of idolatries, --- And whoredom people did commit, And sins of the flesh in holy writ; And hence were banish'd from the earth Which gave the several nations birth. Of Canaanites and after them, The Philistines that err'd the same; The Romans, Greeks, and other pagans, That had their astharoths, and dagons And worship'd bulls, and goats and heifers; And were your oracle believers; Whichbrought the curse of God upon them: And hence it is that there is no man, Who sees affection that you have For that which workmen did engrave, But fears a judgment for the sin, And wickedness that is there in; So that I preach and pray and fast--- Quoth Cincinat, not much of the last; At least may spare it, and take food, As prayers can do but little good; And all your exhortation, is A rhapsode of absurdities, To make the simple people stare, About this wild fowl of the air. But as you seem to be a fool, The best way is to crack your skull And let in light to give you sense And make your soul like other mens; Removing this enthusiasm, That turns your brain to Jewishism. With that he drew as if to strike; But one among the people, quick, Who was a great philosoper, Though yet had made but little stir, Put by the blow, and thus bespoke; Quoth he, your hot-born rage revoke, Nor draw your sword upon the cloth, Because you are a little wroth; And without reason or just cause, what has been thrown out; whereas, It is a general allegation, And turns upon the whole profession Of club, which has so broad a base It easily bears it, in this case, And is not personal alone, To you on whom the thing is thrown; And when a number are to bear The ignominy of the affair, It is as nothing to the whole. Have you Don Quixotte in your skull, And yet not recollect the speech, He made t' a town within his reach, Which had conceiv'd offence, because His Sancho braying like an ass; At which he was not any slouch; Did seem to say they were just such? He tells them that no words can strike Or hurt a body politic, Because the offence has no just base Of individual in the case. Are not the learn'd professions known To be just string to harp upon? We say that lawyers are all rogues, And preacher, that he but humbugs; And of physician, that he kills; More than he cures, with his damn'd pills, And yet we have not on our backs, The whole of these like pedlars packs; For the physician, lawyer, priest, I aughs at the matter, as a jest. Why, then enrag'd, at any one, For obloquy, that he has thrown, Just for a theme of his discourse, To raise a laugh among the boors' Do they who write your worst of satires, And ironies and all such matters, Possess a temper worse than others, Drawn from the nature of their mothers; Or just to shew their wit, at times, They scratch out paragraphs and rhymes; Attack the elergy, or the bar; Or with hypocrates make war; Or chuse a country, or a town To be the subject of lampoon; Who laugh and read the ridicule; And only but a natural fool, Would take in head to fight or fence; Or 'gainst the slander break his shins. But where there may be some just base, Of obloquy, in any case, It more behooves to bear, as here, Where though the matter may be clear, You have a right to wear what badge, You choose; yet, there are who alledge, It is a trespass to break heads; For though the man is pleas'd who reads, The history of atchievment, yet, Not him who feels the blow on's pate. Unseasonable chivalry, Does not with modern times agree; Where law takes place of ancient prow'ss, puts a stop to the abuse, Nor troubles knights to knock down cows; Or giants that have broke a house; So that it is unnecessary; To eudgel any adversary, Especially a clergyman, Who has his priviledge: again,---- Inglorious to make war with such, Not having honor very much, Of victory, when it is obtain'd.---- There was a corporal by, hot-brain'd; Who had been in the war, and fought; But no bald eagle, yet had got; Or was a partner of the club, Which military had set up; And took it much amiss that those, Who equally had fac'd the foes, Unworthily, were left i' the lurch, To stand the back side of the porch, And though, were also at the mustering; Yet had not at the breast, or postern, A thing, significant of this---- For his part, he was wounded thrice, While that same officer that spoke, Had scarcely ever seen the smoke. But since he was so hot to fight, With clergyman, no man of might, Had better turn to him a soldier, Would make his blood a little colder; And ease him of intemperate passion; Because the clergyman had reason, And others, to find fault, and blame, The Cincinnat that left no fame, To th' common soldier, and the sergeant, But of their own accord, took charge on't; And wore this honor as their own, Appropriate to themselves alone. The Cincinnat, who heard this, spoke. Quoth he, whether, in, or, out of smoke; Or where, the bullets flew, or fell; And men, and muskets, fought like hell; No matter, to an officer, Who only has a right to wear, The emblem of the victory; Because there must be low and high; And what is better born and bread, 'Tis reasonable should be the head. For what our nature makes the foot, Doth, in the inferior station trot. As, in this very body of ours, We do not go, upon all fours; So, it is reasonable, there should, Be a distinction of the brood; And those who have but little sense And lower quality of brains, Should occupy a sphere beneath. Is not the officer the head? When we gave orders you obey'd, So that 'tis proper you possess But the inferior grade and place; And have no badge or institution. The corporal felt his passion rushing.--- Quoth he, have just as good a right, As you, though thus you did come by't To take to ourselves and wear a badge. The Cincinnat felt greater rage. Quoth he, forsooth, because you fought, Where battle was a little hot, You claim the privilege with us, To be o' th' inside of the house, To have insignia at your breast! As well might an irrational beast, The horse that draws artillery gun, Or soldier had to ride upon, Put in for heraldry, because, Has sometimes been where dancer was. What would you think to see a ribbon Or badge, hung at his tail, or hipbone! A burlesque on your appetite, To have this matter made so light, Which were a proper ridicule When such a Teague O'Regan fool As you, would claim the establishment. The corporal's anger which was pent Broke out.---It was not proof of sense, Or other quality of brains, Quoth he, that fabricated one, An officer, and let alone, The other, that was just as good; But Congress, that was in the mood; For, had a comrade, in my hut, That would have made a perfect butt, Of many that were officers, Who had as little sense as bears--- And yet forsooth poor soldier dick, May wish for honor, till he's sick, And get no knob, or bit of ribbon, Hung at his bosom, or his hipbone, As many of the codheads have, Who did not shew themselves so brave, In any battle that was fought. At this, the Cincinnat, red hot, Drew out his hanger, to shed blood, And hew down corporal, as he stood: But thought it best, t' accost him first, Before the matter came to th' worst. As Homer, when he wages battle, Between two of heroic cattle, He has a parly, and a speech, To know each other, which is which; And, of what origin, they were; And, how the devil, they came there: Because, whoknows, but they were cousins? So should not cut each others weazons; But, turn to other combatants: And even in the time of giants, And champions, throughout christendom, Before they, hand to hand, did come, And actual clashing of the swords, 'Twas not unusual to have words; Though what was usual to be said, Have not at present in my head: But do, remember, very well,--- What from our Cincinnatus fell, “Quoth he, if, so preposterous, T' have also what they call a goose, Is your ambition, why not take, God's name, and hang it at your neck; Or at your breech, or back, or bosom; Or like a turkey-cock, at nose o' 'im? Some wooden peg, or pewter noggin, To wear it as you are a joging; Or copper ball, or piece of metal Inferior, for the common cattle; With something on it like a bird Or sign of poultry; whence infer'd, That you have rob'd hen-roosts, you rogue Or stole a duck or drake incog; When rations were a little scarce, This seem'd to make the thing a farce; And a militia man just by, Who listen'd t' him attentively, Was angry, and began to frown, To see the soldier so run down. Quoth he, though but a common rat, I am, and you a Cincinnat. Great captain, that have spoke so loud, In your haranguing to the croud; And, though I know the soldier would Much rather have a fowl for food, And eat the wing or rib of a goose, Than smell its picture at his nose; Yet take a part in his defence, Because he speaks the better sense; And undervaluing, you throughout Hits me, and others in the croud, Who being but militia persons, Who in the war have made exertions Yet have no right to wear the badge, As indirectly you alledge, By title and the club assum'd--- By this time common fame had drum'd The like ideas every where, Amongst the people that were there, With such exaggeration, as--- Is natural in the like case; Videlicet, that the prognatus Who then was there of Cincinnatus Had ridicul'd all common people; And blackguarded them like the devil, Calling them all scrubs and bodkins, And habberdashers, and such odd things: How, that they ran away at York, And left the regulars at the work; And fled at Germantown and broke, Whilst they were busy in the smoke: At other places turn'd about, And scarcely ever shew'd their snout, Where there was danger, or hot fire. One of the people that was nigher, Became the spokesman of the rest; And rage now boiling in his breast; Quoth he, no doubt, we are but goats And scarce above the beast that trots, Compar'd with you, in what was done, And services, you son of a gun; Tag-rag and bob-tail, doubtless, are Compar'd with vet'ran officer: Because we have not at our bosom That thing of yours, a rosy crozum; Are not embellish'd with a broach, At head or neck, or breast, or crotch; A Latin motto or an ensign, Our toils, or services evincing; Being but a vulgar sort of whigs, That in the marches danc'd our jigs; Nor help'd at Trenton to take Hessians; Or fought like you, on other occasions; Or at the Cowpens, made good battle; And so are but a common cattle; And you alone sustain'd the cause, While we like bears at home suck'd paws; And cannot now advance a claim, To hieroglyphic of your same. Quoth Cincinnat, the charge is false, And of the nature of all tales, Which contradict, and shew by proof, Intrinsical, what they are of. What? an American, by birth, Degrade the military worth, And lessen the applause, Of my compatriots, in the cause, Of those who fought, in front, or flank, In regular, or militia rank. My sentiments are the reverse; And never had in view t' asperse The signal honor you have won, In order to advance my own. These words had reason, but his voice Was wholly buried in the noise; And as the clamour was, to beat And chastise, this our Cincinnat, His words could not restrain the mob, Or check the violence of hubbub. For where a multitude convenes To carry on some hot designs, They must do something, or seem slack, Of skill and courage, for the attack. So rushing discompos'd, the throng, Brought violence, and blows along: Here one uprais'd a ponderous stone; Another got an old horse bone; Elsewhere, was seen, a block of wood, Portending to the knight no good; And all around, the face of war Appear'd, just gathering, in the air. Say, shall he wage an equal fight; And wound whole ranks, and kill outright; Like val'rous Hector, at the siege, Of Troy, compose a perfect bridge, Of bodies, upon which to tread, And swell the rivers with the dead; Or mow a whole battalion down, Like Ajax, son of Telamon; Construct a rampart of the slain; And strew with carcases the plain? Or shall I bid him jump among, The individuals of the throng; Like Alexander when half crazy He leapt the walls of Oxcydracy? Or shall I render him expert The various wiles of war t' exert; And now give way, and now advance, And spit a parcel on his lance? Shall I describe a various fray, And change the fortune of the day; Now on the verge of a defeat; And now, in turn, advantage get; One while broke down, like very stubble; Now rise, and give the foe more trouble? What wounds shall specify; what heart, Oppress with javelin or dart? What names relate, and characters Of those who rag'd this day like bears? I wave the arduous task of this; Because narration would be lies; For, just the naked truth express'd, In history, is always best. Hence shall relate what came to pass; And how the issue really was; Videlicet---but here again, I feel the rushing epic vein, To bring Minerva, from the clouds, Down sliding through aerial shrouds; To make her vet'ran champion wise, And teach him that no honor lies In waging battle, where the chance, Of war, between the combatants, Is so unequal, as this was; For, had no head piece, made of brass; Or iron, adamant, or wood; And let him do the best he could; Yet still, the number, and the weight, Of blows, that must assail the pate, Would overpower his best defence, And wound him, or knock out his brains. 'Twas no Minerva, or a God, From dome celestial, or abode, But, his own reason, play'd the part, And put discretion in his heart. For, seeing that the wild misrule, Of mob, as raging to the full, As pedlars at an Ulster fair, With their shilelahs, swung in air, Left him no hope of victory, He thought the best way was to fly, And without waiting for the blows, He turn'd the corner of a house; Escaping from the rioters: As when a morning shadow stirs, And hides itself behind a wood, Before the sun that would suck blood, Pursuing, with his rising heat, The thing that is not adequate, To give him battle, and withstand The numerous beams he has at hand: To overpower it on the plains, And maul it, and knock out its brains. Retir'd, and to a tavern got, Where such disturbance there was not; Fatigu'd with what had sung and said, Now on a sofa laid his head; Because he did not wish to trudge. God Morpheus who does not begrudge A dream, lent one to keep him quiet. He saw a plain, and there espied, The champions of the former period, And airy coursers, on which they rode: The cavalcade of ancient knight-hood? A shew would do the very sight good; Such, as the monsters, had knock'd down; And dwarfs, and giants, overthrown; And fiery dragons of the air; And pale-fac'd virgins that were there; Whom they had rescued from the grasp, Of ravishers that did enclasp Their snowy bodies, in their arms; And drank the lustre of their charms; Or knights themselves, who had been freed, From oaken durance, where were tree'd; Or bound in rocks, where by a spell, They had remained invisible, The Cincinnat approach'd the throng, Who beckon'd him to come along; As recognizing his advance, To be that of no common man's; But one who came to join the squad, By that same baublet that he had; With ensign of the eagle's beak, And motto in th' original Greek Or Latin, knew not which it was: For things had come to such a pass, When these knights flourish'd, devil a one, Had such a thing as learning known; But all depended on their slashing, For fame, and for diurnal ration; And cut and carv'd their sustenance, By force of vig'rous arm and lance. The Cincinnat address'd as ought, With chosen words and select thought. Quoth he, my seniors, in the art, Of chevalry's great master part; You see me, of a junior breed; A germ, sprung from the self same seed, Of predecessors in romance, And orders that did flourish once; Profession now degenerate, Reduc'd to the very lowest state; For even the Cincinnati club Which imitative is set up, Is much traduce'd, and badge do wear Is greatly undervalu'd here; Particularly a pedagogue, And clergyman that is in vogue, And other cavilers, just now I met with in a town came through; Do lead astray the populace, Who have no judgment in the case. A senior from the squad step'd forth, Of a superior mein, and worth: Quoth he, the more the degration, Of chivalry, the more occasion, For an exertion of the brain, To kindle up the thing again; And doubtless this same club of yours, Has, as't were added boots and spurs, To bring it to a trot once more And restorate the days of yore. And, if discouragements arise, In this the greater honor lies, To overcome and persevere. 'Tis true, no dragons of the air, Or fiery vultures do occur, T' encounter with, and make a stir; Or damsels ravish'd in a wood; Or giant to let out his blood: Or an inchanter with his spell; But yet there is the devil in hell To pay with other villainies, That in your modern days take rise Such as false notions of the right, Which it behooves a valourous knight T' arraign with free born thought and speech And tell the people which is which; And no less courage is requir'd, To speak the truth with which are fir'd; Than to knock down a cow at grass, Or monster that did come to pass. Meantime a message had been sent By Charlemagne to call from tent, By trumpeter, the several orders, That lay upon th' enchanted borders, Our hero look'd to see where was, Old Cincinnatus in the case. In vain, for, in elysium hous'd, His mettle had not yet be rous'd; But mixed, with the ignoble shades, Did wander, idly in the glades; And as in life, had been a plowman, And wore no badge, or dress uncommon; So now he troubles not his herd, With these; but walks among the dead, The Romans, or obscurer Greeks; That wore no pendle at their necks. At this the Cincinnat below, Awaking as some one came through, Saw nothing but the standing chairs, And landlord coming down the stairs. It would seem a little strange, what could have induced this bard, to have made choice of the preceding subject for his poem, as not being an American; or at least, long in America; and could not be much interested, one would think, in the institution of the Cincinnati Society. But it is to be observed, that poets, chuse a subject, and ridicule, or praise, not because they care any thing about the matter; but because there may be some novelty or originality in the subject; and, so, what they write, not altogether beaten and common. It may be also just to observe, that foreigners were more alarmed at the institution of the society than Americans, and for this reason, because, they saw at home the orders of nobility with stars, garters, crosses, &amp;c. and felt the weight of superior rank, of which these were sometimes the badges: and transferring the idea to the Cincinnati, they considered them in the same point of view. Hence, it was, that Mirabeau, in France, was led to compose a treatise against the institution, shewing it to be, as he conceived, unfavorable to equality, and dangerous to the liberty of these states. Burke has been the only American that has written, professedly, on the tendency of this club: but, as his name imports, I take it he must have been, originally, an Irishman; and had conceived, in that country, an unfavorable idea of titled persons, Sir this, and Sir that one, &amp;c. Probably he has been of the Hearts of Oak, or White Boys, who were of a levelling principle, and opposed to all elevation from the common mass. For my part, I could never see that it was of any consequence whether this institution existed or not. For it must naturally evaporate in a few years, the spirit of the times being wholly changed, from what it was in the days of chivalry, and not capable of supporting an excrescene which has no natural root, or foundation in the opinion of the people. The public may think what it will of this little work of the unfortunate Scotchman; but it appears to me, to have the vivida vis, animi, in a very great degree; and the versification, though careless, is spirited. The brokenness and disjointings of the verses, one line running into, and interlaced with another, carries it beyond the monotous, though perhaps, more musical imitators of Butler: amongst whom, Trumbull, of Connecticut, easily deserves the first place; yet though in his similies, and other excellencies of his composition, he may surpass the Cincinnatus of M`Comas; nevertheless I must give the Scotch bard the praise of greater variety in the structure of his verses. I should have been glad to have seen him before his exit. I have no doubt, that want of food, reducing him to great weakness, together with pain of mind from his desolate situation, in a new country, where there were but few in the same line with himself, with whom he could share his joys, or communicate his griefs, might hasten the dissolution of his frame, prematurely. For, from what I have collected of the mode of life and private history, in general, of bards, and those who live by their wits, in old countries, I can easily conceive the pleasure which they have with each other, when, after a fortunate paragraph with one, or a copy of verses with another, they collect a few shillings, and after starving several days in the garrets while they had been writing these, they now come together, in an evening, to break their fast, with a few tripes, and a little ale, to exhilirate their hearts. Peace to the manes of M`Comas. He lies buried in the Potter's-field; with a single stone at his head, which I myself, though I do not wish to boast of it, have put there, with this inscription on it, and nothing more, Sanders M`Comas. I hope there will be no mistake, in future times, reading it M`Comus, instead of M`Comas: because, it might be thought, to be a composition of the name of the god of wit among the Romans, which was Comus, with the word Mac, put to it, which is a Scoth adjective, which would puzzle antiquarians, and be unintelligible: for the fact is, he was a Scotchman, and his name spelled, as I have written it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">BOOK I. CHAPTER I. Having got through this long introduction which may resemble that species of pompion they call a quashaw, whose neck is longer than the whole body; I say resemble it, for it will not be altogether like it, as it will not be more at most, than a third of the work. However it has been long enough, in all conscience. We hasten to the sequel of the adventures of the Captain, and Teague his servant. It will be recollected, that pestered with the preposterous ambition of the bog-trotter; the Captain, by the advice of a gentleman, had consented to let him try his luck of getting into some employment under government. However; after reflecting with himself, a long time on the subject, he could not help expressing to the gentleman, with whom he was still in conversation, his doubt of the success of such pretensions. Said he, after all, I do not see, how it can be reasonable to suppose that he can come to any great height, in state affairs: He is totally illiterate and uncultivated. As to that, said the gentleman, it is no reason at all. Do we not read in history of persons of the lowest education who have risen to the greatest heights both in the civil, and military line. Butcher's sons, keepers of pigs, feeders of sheep, traffickers in small wares, have come to be Cardinals, Popes, and ministers of state. That impuse of mind which he discovers to be something, indicates a capacity of being so. We seldom find in men, a strong desire of obtaining any thing which depends on human power, who have not been able to obtain it. Hence it has been said, that let a man determine to be Lord Mayor of London, and he may arrive at that dignity. The Captain yielding to the reasons, began to think, in what manner, it might be proper, to give him an introduction, and bring him forward; whether to endeavor to cultivate an acquaintance with some members of Congress, or the heads of departments, such as the Secretary of the Treasury, of State, at War, &amp;c. or to begin with some of the subordinate clerks, and rise gradually to the knowledge of the principals. This, said the gentleman, would be beginning at the wrong end. These people must naturally be jealous, especially of such as appear to have talents; not knowing but that in time they may come to supercede them. The most adviseable way is to attack the head at once: Present him at the levee of the President, and make him known to the Chief Magistrate. This is going to the fountain, and not depending on the streams, that divide among themselves; and sometimes sink in the earth, and disappear. Having been once seen at court, he will acquire friends; and the President himself, can with more propriety take notice of him. But would it not be necessary, said the Captain, before we undertake to present him at the levee of the President, that I should have him rubbed down, and cloathed a little better than he is at present. Not at all, said the gentleman. It will be best to present him, puris naturalibus, just as he is, without brogues; in his over-alls, with that long coat and slouched hat, which you have given him to wear. The President seeing him as he is, will imagine what he may be, when he comes to be dressed off in a suitable manner; and imagination always out-goes the reality. Besides; unless he had been accustomed for some time to good cloathing, he will appear aukward in it, and move with pain to himself, and to others. Take a country girl that is neat enough in her short gown and petticoat, and put her in a fine silk with stays, and she will appear to much less advantage. A clown in his jacket and trowsers, is respectable; but in a broadcloth coat, with suitable habiliments, he would move ridicule. Governed by these observations, the Captain proposed to take Teague to the levee the next evening. CHAP. II. Containing Observations. The gentleman who thus advised the Captain, though a grave man, I do not think was serious. He has been what we call a wag, and wished to amuse himself with the extravagance of introducing Teague as a candidate for public offices, and taking him to the Levee. For the Irishman was certainly in no very decent apparel to appear at the court, even of a republic. The jacket and trowsers, or overalls, as some call them, that he had upon him, though of rough materials, being a coarse tow linen, that had not had but one boiling before it was made up, were not even whole; what is more, not clean, not that he had voluntarily on some great occasion, for a public or private calamity, as was the manner of the Jews, rent his garments, and put on sackcloth, and strewed ashes on his head; but what came to the same thing, by lying by the fire side at night, and wrestling in the day with the hostler, and servants at the tavern, he was reduced to the same raggedness and ash-powdered state. Nevertheless, though there might not have been time to have washed his duds; yet a patch or two might have been put upon his vestments; a considerable impression having been made upon his flank, by a sharp point; and his rear being uncovered, a hand's-breadth or more; unless indeed his breeches had been taken off altogether, and he had come forward, a real sans culotte, without any thing on his backside at all. CHAP. III. The Levee. Having waited with impatience for the evening, the Captain, with the candidate, set out for the levee. Arriving at the door, the Captain, entering first, and Teague just behind, he addressed the President: Said he, may it please your Excellency, here is a young man, whom I take the liberty to introduce, as a candidate for state employment. He has been offered a seat in Congress. But it appears to me that a place in the executive department would suit him better; his name is Teague O'Regan; and has been for some time a servant of mine, a bog-trotter; but I believe I could now spare him if your Excellency has occasion to make use of him. The Attorney General, and several others who were present, were a good deal confounded at the proposition. A little lean Frenchman in in the room, with a sword by his side, was astonished; and expressed above an hundred foutres to himself in the compass of a minute; I do not mean that he spoke out, but thought them to himself in a short space. A British consul present, who was a man of a philosophic turn of mind, could not but reflect on the nature of a republican government, and the extraordinary assurance of the lowest class to pretend to offices. The President, in the mean time, contemplating the object, made a pause. But after some time recollecting himself, bowed to the Captain, and to Teague, and signified that doubtless proper notice should be taken of the merits of the gentleman, and provision made for him. This he said, bowing at the same time in a circular manner, and turning round as if to converse with another person, to whom attention was in his turn, due. Teague in the mean time advancing with his mouth open, and both his arms stretched out, was about to harrangue in his own dialect, as plase your honor, &amp;c. But an aid of the President, or some one concerned in the ceremonial of the occasion, touching the Captain and Teague, and conversing with them towards the door, gave them to understand, that they might depart for the present; and that there was no manner of question, but that his Excellency had taken a note of the matter, and when any appointment was about to take place, the gentleman would be remembered. CHAP. IV. Containing Remarks &amp; Observations. I observe, from some scraps, in the public papers, that the holding a levee by the President of the United States, has given offence, to men of severe, and extreme republican ideas: For, as at the reformation from the Roman Catholic superstition, the puritans, and other thorough paced reformists, were offended with the Church of England, for retaining some particulars of the ancient ceremonies; such as the ring in marriage; the cross in baptism; the surplice; kneeling at the sacrament; bowing at the name of Jesus, &amp;c. so here; the more rigid revolutionists from monarchy, object to any vestige of its customs, and would lay aside totally all resemblance of it. On the other hand, it is suggested by those who would justify, or, apologize for the holding a levee, that it is in itself, no substance or essential of monarchy; it is, at the most, but a shadow of it, and can do little harm; that the institution was suggested by John Adams, who having just returned from his embassy in England, had no doubt good reason to suppose, that it would be pleasing to the English people who were accustomed to such things; and to the king especially, who, as far as we understand from Peter Pindar, is but a thick-headed prince: It would be pleasing to him, to reflect that though he had lost direct authority and jurisdiction in these states, yet we were still disposed to touch, as it were, the hem of his garment, and adopt some of the trappings of royalty. In this case he could with more propriety take notice of his brother George; having a levee like another prince, than if he remained but a bare republican, like a plucked fowl, without any plumage to decorate his dignity. It is also said, that it was on this principle that Citizen Adams, proposed introducing titles of nobility, such as, Duke and Dutchess, Marquiss and Marchioness, Count and Countess, Baronet and Baroness, &amp;c. For, that complying in these small matters with the stile of the English ranks, and the genius of their government, it would produce and preserve a greater amity between the nations; and with the court especially, and enable us to obtain greater advantages in our treaties of commerce. Whatever may have been the principle, I do not think the proposition bad. It could not be blameable; for Saint Paul himself, in matters of religion, a thing much more delicate in its nature, did not hesitate to shave the heads of four young men, to please the Jews; and what was worse, circumcised the poor boy Timothy. What then, if to humour a weak king, and a prejudiced people, we had received the appellations of nobility? Besides; the matter might have been so managed, as not to injure the stamina of our constitution; that is, not to confer the titles; but let the people take them. Carlisle, for instance, the constable in Philadelphia, might have called himself Lord Carlisle, and so on. The advocates for a levee, say, that it is useful in order to avoid the interruptions of persons calling on the President at his private hours, who have no other business than merely to be introduced and to see him; that setting a couple of hours aside, one day in the week, for the purpose of satisfying the curiosity of the people, is good œconomy; and is like throwing a barrel to a whale, in order to preserve the ship. For, that, if this was not indulged, little else could be done through the week, than attending to the formality of receiving visitants. To this it is answered that it must be impertient in any one to call upon the President who has no business with him, and if he has business, a levee is not the place to settle it; that the Roman Pretors, and Grecian Archons made out to discharge their offices, without this expedient; that it is not consistent with the honor of wise and modest republicans to have it supposed, that from idle, and light-headed curiosity, they would be troublesome to their chief magistrate; if any were so, calling once, they could be dismissed in such a manner, as to cure them of it; and the thing being once known to be improper, the idea would pervade the mass of the citizens, and the most uninstructed, would be taught not to transgress by so obvious an intrusion. Besides; the curiosity of seeing a man eminent in office, exists chiefly with weak minds; for the more solid know, that it is not the figure of a great man that has made him such; but a series of prudent and successful conduct. They are sensible that when they see the most distinguished in arts, in letters, or in arms, they will see a person that looks just like another man. Is it worth while then, say the anti-lee-vites, to consult the curiosity of gaping haubucks, by obliging the chief magistrate of a government, to shew himself to them once a week, when he has so much real business on his hands? For my part, lying at the back of a mountain here; the cool west wind blowing on me; I find myself little heated with the difference of opinions on this question. All I shall say, is, that the ceremony of a levee would not be agreeable to my mind; and if I should be chosen President at any time, with which my friends flatter me, I believe I shall not continue it, unless indeed, I should be allowed to discharge it by proxy. For I could not myself, submit to stand two hours, once a week, in a circle, like a bear at a stake, to be saluted by all comers and goers, and be obliged to say, some words of course, to get clear of them. It is possible, this declaration may affect my election, but such is my habit of candour, that being on the subject, I could not help making it. And I flatter myself, the most streneous lee-vites, may be reconciled to it, when I propose in its place to have myself taken off the more abundantly in portraits, and to have innumerable medals struck representing my physiognomy and features; and to assist this, I shall not be backward, to have discriptions given of my person, manners, and apparel, to satisfy the curiosity of strangers. This I hope will suffice. CHAP. V. From the reception at the levee, which the Captain thought favorable, he began to entertain more confidence in the advancement of Teague; and, under this impression, thought it now adviseable to begin to take some pains with his bodily appearance, and by the next interview, produce him to the best advantage. To conduct this by system, the first thing was to heave him down, as it were, and scrape off his barnacles. This was done by ordering into an apartment of the kitchen, at the Indian Queen, a tub of warm water. His overalls being stript off, and putting his feet and legs in this, with hickory ashes, and a pint of soft soap, the hostler was occupied an hour or two, in the necessary lotion and friction, until the upper skin began to come off, and the natural complexion of his flesh appear. After this being stript altogether, his whole body underwent the same operation, the Captain standing by, and ordering his joints to be stretched, in the manner of the Turks in their baths. After this, a clean shirt was put on him, and the usual attire of a common man. CHAP. VI. The next thing to be done towards forming the bog-trotter, to some degree of decency, was the teaching him some more easy movements of his person, so as not to lift his feet so high, or make such long strides; as not being necessary, where there were now no sloughs or ditches to leap over, but carpets, or plain floors to step upon. This, with the instructing him, in what manner, to turn his toes out, or at least to keep his feet parallel in walking; and turning round, to throw one heel into the hollow of the other foot; at the same time, in what manner to bear his arms and head; and to preserve, or, incline his body, in receiving or returning a salutation: considering by what means this was best attainable, the Captain thought to himself it might be adviseable, in the first instance, to employ a dancing master. For though the lessons of such a teacher, might not give ease of behavior, all at once, yet these might lay the foundation of it. For, no man ever came from the hands of a dancing master with a natural ease and flexibility of joint and limb; yet being taught to move by rule at first, in the course of mixing with good company, the wire edge of art would wear off, and an ease of demeanor be attained. For this reason he thought proper, the next morning, to send for Monsieur Douperie, and to address him as follows: Monsieur Douperie, said he, here is a young man of some talents, as the world supposes, though I never could find them in him; who, is in a fair way to be introduced into the political, and probably the gay world: and as he is but rustic and aukward in his movements, I would wish to have him polished; not that I expect he can attain to great perfection in the highest species of the dance, such as the minuet, or the cotilion, or even the manœuvres of a country dance; but simply in the position of his feet, and to step and move with propriety. For I do not think it necessary for a statesman, that he be a proficient in the saltatory art; but, simply, that he be able to bear himself upright, and to enter a room in an easy manner, and not take too long strides in walking across the floor. The Frenchman, eyeing Teague, thought with himself, that he was but a rough subject to work upon; nevertheless, concealing his sentiment, as the manner of the nation is polite and compliant, he replied. Monsieur Capitaine, said he, ver great sensible of de honneur, que vous me faites, de attitude of dourself be so ver natural, dat prove de high degree que vous acquis in de art dat I tashe; and trow un grand lustre, on de talents dat I possede. Such was the compliment to the Captain himself; though, by the bye, he was but a plain man, and had never been taught to dance. Monsieur Douperie continuing, turned his attention now to the bog-trotter. Dis Monsieur, said he, appear de best calcule of de vorld for de danse. Sa taille, ver good, his limb promettent, ver much en faveur of his talents futures. His muscle, et son apparance nerveuse, confirm me of his strense in de execution. His eye, be ver good, pour fixet son visavis, his partner. Tout me promet un grand expectation make Monsieur most egal myself, in de art of de danse. As to that, said the Captain, I would not have you too sanguine. You do not take into view the low state in which he is; and what pains will be necessary before you can bring him to that point where you begin with others. So low is my opinion of his present grade in point of manners, that I had thought of putting him a while under the care of a person skilled in breaking oxen, that he might be taught to move by rule in some rough way at first, before I would trouble you with giving him the nicer precepts that respect the locomotive art. Tres plaisant Capitaine, ver plaisant, said the dancing master, mais, j'me promet dat Monsieur make ver good proficiance, in ver short time. The Captain now thinking proper to withdraw, left Teague to his lessons. CHAP. VII. Monsieur Patrick, said Monsieur Douperie, for understanding that he was an Irishman, and thinking that all Irishmen were named Patrick, he gave him this appellation: Monsieur Patrick, said he, il faut commencer, par les principes; must begin by de principle. La primiere principe, de first lessong est placer les pieds; place de foot. Voyez; dis foot, cy; comme cela, (shewing him how to place his foot) and ce luy, dat foot, la; comme dis foot. (Shewing him by his own foot how to place it) Tournez les pieds; open de foot, quoi! vous ouvrez la bouche; vous open de mout, and not de foot. Vous keep vos foot in de same position, et vous baillez: you open de mout. La secon principe, is to keep de body droit; trait. Must sit firm sur ses membres, on de limb. Tenez votre body as dis (shewing him in what manner to keep his body) assieyez vous, sur vos membres, comme ce la; dis way Monsieur Quoi! encore la bouche ouverte, you open de mout again Monsieur Patrick. Fermez la bouche, shut de mout. I stop here to observe, that the opening the mouth when an exertion of the mind or body is required, is a habit very common with uninformed men, and not at all peculiar to Teague: you will observe, that men, who have not been long, or at least much in the habit of writing, when they put pen to paper, open the mouth, and protrude the tongue, moving it, as the pen turns to the right hand or to the left; or draws the stroke long or short; and, you will see a cordwainer of good skill in his trade, from mere habit, and not any defect of art, put out his tongue, and move it, as if it could guide his hand, when he is parcing nicely the margin of the soal of a shoe or boot: Having made this observation in justice to the bog-trotter, I return to my narration. The Captain coming in at this point of the business, made enquiry of Monsieur Douperie, what success he appeared to have with his pupil. Bien tolerable, Monsieur Capitaine, said Monsieur Douperie, ver tolerable: Monsieur es d'une tres bonne naturel; ver good disposition. A la commencement il ne faut pas nous flatter, must not flatter, wid de plus haut degre, du succes; at de first of de lessong. The Captain, not so much from the words of the dancing master, as from his countenance, and the tone of his voice, saw, that he was not so sanguine with regard to the proficiency of the bog-trotter as he had been at first: Nevertheless, he was not discouraged in suffering Monsieur Douperie to go on with his lessons; because he expected little more, as has been said, than some improvement of step and gait. Nor did he draw any conclusion unfavorable with respect to the attainments of the bog-trotter in a political career; because he well that auk wardness of manner is not at all inconsistent with the highest literary and political abilities; and that some of the greatest geniusess that the world has produced have never been able to attain the graces of behavior. The poet Horace, says of Virgil; magnum ingenium sub inculto corpore latet: and the anecdote of Harley, earl of Oxford, is well known; who, when Queen Anne made him Lord Treasurer, his dancing master expressed his astonishment, and wondered what the Queen could see in him; for he was the greatest dunce he ever had at his school. With these reflections withdrawing he left the Frenchman to go on with his lesson. La troisieme principe; de tird lessong, said Monsieur Douperie, is to lift de foot; you lift de foot, Monsieur Patrick, le pied droit, de right foot furs; here Teague raised the left, O! mon dieu, said the dancing master, le pied droit, et non pas le guache; de right foot, and not de left. Est il possible, you no disting de right foot from de left. Il faut lever le guache: a la bonne heure, you lift de left foot. Now, Monsieur Patrick; un pas avec le pied guache; lift de left foot. Here Teague lifted the right foot, thinking of the former lesson, and willing to please the dancing master by giving him that foot which had seemed to be so much in request with him. O! mon dieu, par blieu, said Monsieur Douperie, est il possible you no disting de right foot from de left? It is observable of the French character that while they preserve their temper, they are all complaisance, and have the sofest words imaginable; but when they break, it is all at once, and they pass to the opposite extreme of peevishness. It is not altogether owing to an irritability of nerve but to that system of politeness which they cultivate; because when the chord of civility is immoderately stretched by a concealment of the feelings, when it is let go, it flies the farther, and with the quicker vibration, beyond the medium of its tension. O! mon dieu, par blieu, said the Frenchman; and here he had almost said foutre, which is one of the worst epithets that is given, when great contempt is about to be expressed. However, composing his temper, and resuming his instructions; he continued; now Monsieur Patrick, said he, le pied droit, lift de right foot. Here Teague, as he had not pleased his instructor by what he had done last, viz. lifting the right foot, now lifted the left, being always at cross purposes, as it were, or still too far forward, or too far back in his motions, to correspond with the directions given. O! diable, diable, said the Frenchman, raising his voice, and almost vociferating; quoi ferai je? il est impossible d' instruire cet garcon: no possible make you understand fat I say, you do. Attendez vous, Monsieur Patrick; you look at me, and lift de foot dat I lift; now I lift de right foot; lift de right foot. Teague standing opposite the master, and lifting that foot which was on the same side with that of the instructor made the same blunder as before, and lifted the left foot. Monsieur Douperie enraged beyond all bearing, ran out of the room, and left his scholar for the present. The day after this, Monsieur Douperie, having composed his temper and attending, the Captain made enquiry, as usual, of the progress of his pupil. The Frenchman endeavoring to put the best face on the matter, said some things of course and complimentary; but could not help intimating that it was une grand difficulty en le commencement, in de beginning, to make Monsieur disting de difference of de right foot, and de left. As to that, said the Captain, it is a national incapacity; for which, as also for their propensity to make what they call bulls, it is difficult to account. There are not a people more brave than the aborigines of Ireland, and are far from being destitute of talents, and yet there is a certain liability to blunders, both in their words and actions, that is singular. Whether it is that a mind strong and vigorous, and of extensive range cannot attend to small things; or that a great flow and hurry of animal spirits, carries them too fast for reflection; or that there is a transposition of the brain, so that things present themselves by contraries to the imagination; I cannot tell: but the fact is so that in their own country, as I have been told, when they are taught to dance, which, by the bye, is a hint which I forgot to give you, they bind on the right and left foot different badges, on the one, a twisted wisp of straw, which they call a sugan and on the other a band of ozier twisted in like manner, which they call a gad: so that when the word is given to raise the one foot, and depress the other, it is rise upon sugan, and sink upon gad; so, that though the tiro may not all at once, and on the word given, be able to distinguish the right foot from the left, he may easily tell gad from sugan, as his eye can assist his ear in this case; the object being simple; whereas right and left are relative terms, and that which is on the right in one position, will be on the left in the contrary. Monsieur Douperie was willing to avail himself of this hint, for understanding that the bog-trotter was a candidate for state affairs, he was greatly anxious to have the honor of giving him some proficiency. Accordingly, though he did not procure a straw sugan, and an ozier gad, yet he made use of what he thought might be equivalent, viz. a red rag, and a blue; so that instead of bidding him move the right foot or the left, he could desire him to move the red rag or the blue. Having tied these upon his ancles next morning, he began his lesson. Now, Monsieur Patrick, said he, lift de foot dat hab de red ribbon: Teague obeyed with exactness and promptitude, and raised that foot. Now, said Monsieur Douperie, de foot dat hab de blue ribbon. Teague hit the direction, and raised the foot with the blue rag upon it. A la bonne heure, vous y voila, said the dancing master; ver glad Monsieur Patrick you make so good proficiance; en peu de tems, je vous presentera a l' assemble. You danse ver well, short time. La quatrieme principe, said the dancing master, de fort lessong est former une pas, to make de step. Voyez Monsieur Patrick, fat I do. You make step, ne pas long step, mais van little step. The Irishman attempting to obey the directions and to step, made a stride about an ell in length with his arms stretched out, and gaping at the same time. Foutre, said the dancing master; quoi! Vous baillez; you ope de mout yet. Oh, diable! diable! foutre! une bete! But composing himself, he proceeded. Rangez vous a quartier; step to de van side, comme ce la; shewing in what manner to step out with one foot at right angles to the other. The Irishman, endeavoring to confine his feet to rule, felt himself as much embarrassed as if chained by the heels; and attempting to make the step as requested, and making the usual exertions, with his eyes staring, his arms stretched, and his mouth open, lost the command of himself on the floor, and being thrown from the line of gravity, was about to fall, when to save himself, he made a catch at the dancing master, and drew him down with him. The dancing master supposing that he hand understood him, though in French, when he used the term foutre, and called him a beast, and resenting this, was about to take vengeance, and having heard of their mode of biting, gouging, &amp;c. in America, was much alarmed, and disposed to throw himself on the generosity of the Irishman, as not being able to contend with him in strength: He exclaimed, O! my lord Patrick, excusez moi, pardon, Monsieur Patrick, je demand pardon. Pauvre diable que je suis. I be van poor dible. Vous etes un honnete homme. Ver good man. Un homme brave, courageux, absolument un homme brave, gallant, tres brave, O! je suis un malheureux, I be van poor dible. Je demand pardon, my lord Patrick. These were the exclamations of the Frenchman, though, at the same time, he was uppermost, but entangled by the bog-trotter, who having still a hold of him, was endeavoring to rise; which the other was disposed to prevent, thinking it adviseable to retain the advantage he possessed, and to keep him down until he could appease him by his entreaties, or until help should arrive so continuing his expostulation, he exclaimed, O! my lord Patrick, faites moi, grace. I give you my money. J'ai beacoup d'argent. I give you an order sur mon intendant de cent Louis; one, two, tree hundred guinea. I forgive de compensation of de lessong, Teague, in the mean time, having understood that chastisement was usually given at school, for inattention or flowness in acquiring the elements, and not understanding broken French, conceived, that the dancing master was expressing his resentment, and about to inflict punishment; and therefore endeavoured to excuse himself by a speech on his part. God love your shoul, said he, dont be after bateing me, because I can't walk like a crippled coose, just at once. By Shaint Patrick, dis is like stoodying law in de workhouse, where de first ting is a good bateing; God love your shoul, let me up, and i'l step as strait as a lame shape, or a dog wid dis leg broke into de bargain. By this time struggling, they were both on their feet, the Frenchman, still calling out, voulez vous me tuer; O! ma femme, mes enfans, spare my life my lord Patrick, and the bog-trotter beginning to curse and swear, and to raise the Irish howl. Being disengaged, the dancing master made his escape, and waiting on the Captain, not wishing to be under the necessity of giving any more lessons, gave him to understand that Monsieur had made ver good proficiance, en ver short time; that he was capable to present himself in public wid all de success possible; that it was not necessary to give him any more lessons. The Captain did not suppose that the Irishman could have made such advances as the politeness of the Frenchman would lead him to believe, but he concluded he might have acquired what would be sufficient as a foundation for his obtaining some decency, though not elegance in his manner and deportment. Paying, therefore, Monsieur Douperie the sum he demanded, and thanking him for the pains he had taken, the Frenchman withdrew. CHAP. VIII. Having bestowed some pains to cultivate the personal movements of the bog-trotter, it now remained to endeavor to improve his manners. This the Captain undertook, himself, and though he had not read Chesterfield, yet he had some common ideas of decency, and delicacy in habits, and behaviour. On this point, addressing his pupil, he began. Teague, said he, you have now got, in literal terms your rough coat off; that is, you have some better dress, than what you used to wear; you have also had some lessons, in what manner, to stand, or move your feet, as there may be occasion; it now remains to instruct you with regard to habits of delicacy, in some matters. You must be careful to keep your hands and face clean; pair your nails, and let no black be under them. Wash the inside of your mouth, and brush your teeth; keep a handkerchief, and wipe your nose with this, not with your bare hand; when you cough, spit out, even should there be nothing to spit, lest the imagination of another, may suppose that there is; you must not belch, or break wind from your mouth, or from any other part. By the bye Teague, I have my fears of you in this last particular, for you know you have not been always careful in trotting with me to observe a delicacy in this respect; and, it would be the devil in hell, if in a company of ladies, an indiscretion of this kind should escape you. In the next place you will be careful to avoid scratching your head, or your backside, or putting your hand in the waistband of your breeches, or turning your back to the fire, and pulling up your coat behind, which is the way of the vulgar. Put but a small quid of tobacco in your mouth, not swell the cheeks as if you had robbed a weaver of a ball of yarn, and put it there. Do not spit on a floor, but in the fire, or in your handkerchief if you must spit. In eating, sit close to the table, do not put your nose too near the plate; put but a little in your mouth at once; do not speak while your mouth is full; or while you chew. If any one speaks to you in this predicament, bow; as much as to say I will answer you presently: drink healths sparingly, if at all. Do not blow in your cup to cool your tea. Keep your infirmities to yourself, and do not complain of costiveness, or laxativeness; of pains in the bowels, &amp;c. A gentleman should have no complaints, unless to his physician, of any thing, but the gout, or a fever, or the like. Give no information of a bad digestion; or food, being heavy, or light to your stomach; of your agreeing with this or that food, but its not agreeing with you, as the vulgar say; that is, as we shall understand you, it gives you the belly-ach. Take care not to value yourself, on your eating, as that will shew a gross mind; or on your drinking much, as that is but a low ambition. Sing no bawdy songs; especially amongst ladies; such as Brian O'Linn, and Arthur O'Bradley; or that about Tristram Shandy O. For though these were suitable enough to your former station, and such as you have been accustomed to sing among the girls at the taverns, yet they will not pass amongst more refined company. You must get some more fashionable airs, such as the Bird, or Guardian Angels, or the like. Even at clubs, amongst gentlemen, I would recommend it to you to avoid lewd and indecent songs; especially if they are of the gross and disgusting kind. As you are an Irishman, a verse or two of Lango Lee might be excuseable, perhaps. It is true, that in the higher ranks, among both males and females, the double entendre is sometimes used; but unless it is with great delicacy, and relieved by singular wit, it is not admissible. There are rules of good manners which you are to observe. Such as when you walk with any person, let them walk next the wall; if you are about to enter a room, with another, let him enter first. or if about to sit down, give way to another who is also about to sit down. Decline the higher seat. You must not talk too much; especially about yourself; boasting, as I have heard you do sometimes, of jumping and trotting, and how you could wrestler, and the like. I am afraid. Teague, that after all the pains I am taking with you, you will spoil the broth, by some out-breakings, of your old tricks, and habits in some way or other. However, since I have suffered myself to be persuaded to try the matter, let it go on, we shall see the issue of it. These are the outlines of some of the hints upon manners, given by the Captain.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">BOOK II. CHAP. I. The Beer House. Having thus far cultivated the bog-trotter by washing, and currying his person, forming his movements; refining his manners, and give him some ideas of delicacy of behavior, it now remained to indoctrinate him in a knowledge of politics: and for this purpose, as he could not read the Gazettes, or other publications, it became necessary, to give him the opportunity of oral information, on political questions: and as attending the debates of Congress, and hearing only, in the galleries, would not put it in his power to join occasionally in the debates, and exercise himself in speaking; the attending private clubs, or spending evenings, occasionally, at beer houses, seemed the more eligible means to be adopted. Accordingly an evening, after this, the Captain taking him to a beer house, and occupying a bench, called for a mug of ale, and bade Teague attend to the conversations that were going forward. The redemption of what are called certificates was at that time the subject of debate. It is well known to the readers of the present day in America, but which perhaps will not be so well understood when this work comes to be read an hundred years hence, that the United States, having incurred debts during the war with Great Britain, and being unable at that time to discharge them, could only give, certificates of the respective sums due to the several creditors; these they did give to the soldiers of their army, to those from whom they had purchased articles, or who had rendered any service: The prospect not being immediate of the public being in a condition of taking up these, and the necessity of many of the holders pressing, they had transferred their right in the certificates for a fourth, fifth, or sixth of their nominal value; in some cases, at a much lower rate. The question was, whether under these circumstances, the original holder should be bound by the contract, and the transferree ought to take the whole sum from the public. It was stated on one side, that it was the folly of the holder to make the contract. There was no fraud or imposition in the case; what he did was with his eyes open. There was no undue advantage on the part of the purchaser, for he took no more than the place of the holder; and the bargain was fair and equal on both sides. The one had a present certainty which he preferred: the other an uncertainty of a greater sum, of which he chose to run the risk. The purchaser who gave credit to the bills of the states, stood in a better point of view than the holder, who distrusting payment, had parted with them. On the other side it was contended, that the certificates being only the evidence of the debt, the receiving that was no payment; that real service was rendered, and real payment should be made; that the purchaser discovered a distrust of the credit of the government as well as the holder, in not giving the full value, and therefore stood on no better ground; that from the prevailing ideas under which these contracts were made, the holder did conceive himself parting with these securities at an under value, and the purchaser, as obtaining them at that rate, but neither had an idea that the loss on the one hand, or the advantage on the other, could be so great as on the principle of the provision made for the discharge of the public debt it had come to be; that for these and other reasons measures ought to have been adopted of a discrimination between the original holders and the transferrees. Teague had listened attentively, and, contrary to the injunction of the Captain, with his mouth open. He would willingly have taken a part in the debates, but the Captain, thinking the subject too abstruse to begin with, did not seem to approve of it, and shaking his head, repressed the disposition of the bog-trotter. The next topic of argument, was that of the assumption of the state debts. In order to understand this we must state; that, in carrying on the war against Great Britain, contracts were made, and debts incurred, on the faith of the confederated states, by their representatives in Congress, and this was called the continental debt. At the same time, contracts were made and debts incurred, on the faith of individual states, by their representatives in the state legislature, and this was called the state debt. This whole debt, continental and state, had been thrown into one mass, and the payment assumed by the Congress. The policy of this measure was now canvassed. On the one side, it was contended, that as the whole debt, continental or state, was payable by the United States, each state paying the quota apportioned by the resolves of the former Congress, and having credit for what state debt contracted on account of the war, was over or beyond this quota, the question was no more than this, whether the ways and means of raising money for the discharge of its proportion of the state debt, should remain with any state, as was before in the case of furnishing its quota; or whether the United States, assuming the debt in the first instance, should take upon themselves to discharge the whole; that it came to the same thing, as the debt was payable by the whole, and the only question, was with whom it should lie to devise ways and means, to discharge it; that the system of finance became more simple, when the United States, assumed the whole, and provided for the payment by ways and means of their own at once; that it would contribute to the energy and secure the establishment of the federal government, to have that government the immediate debtor of the whole amount. To this it was answered, that each state was a better judge of the ways and means, within itself, for the raising money to discharge its debt; and while the United States, now having command of the imposts should necessarily take upon them to collect and provide for the discharge of the continental debt, properly so called; yet it might be left with each state as before, to collect and pay over what was called the state debt; receiving credit from the United States, and having a right to draw from thence, any overplus of that proportion which by the resolves of the former Congress they ought to pay of the whole debt. The Captain thinking this subject also above the comprehension of the Irishman, was not willing that he should speak yet. The next topic was that of the incorportion of the bank of the United States, some contending that no power was given by the constitution to the general government to incorporate banks; others asserting that though not expressly, yet under the article of paying debts, &amp;c. and making laws necessary for that purpose, it was by implication given. The Captain thought this also above the reach of Teague, and obliged him to be silent. The next subject of argument was the policy of the war carrying on against the Indians. By some it was contended that an Indian was a good creature, simple and inoffensive, like a young child; that you might put your finger in his mouth, and he would not bite; that by speaking softly and kindly, and giving him victuals and drink, and leggins, and breech-clouts, and blankets, you might do what you please with him; that when you gave him ammunition and fire arms, he would go out and kill turkies, and shoot down squirrels, and bring you in a deer, now and then; that there was no such thing as an Indian stealing a horse, or burning a house, or taking a scalp, unless you had first stolen his horse, or burnt his house, or made a catch at his scalp; that when you made a treaty with these people, they had such a love of justice, such a sense of honor, such a perfect command of themselves, and their young men, that, there was no danger of their departing from the treaty. On the other hand it was advanced, that, as a savage differed little from a beast of prey; a wolf, or a panther of the woods; was rude; his passions violent, attached to no farm; cultivating no art; his only amusement, or sense of honour, war; or hunting, the image of war; his sense of justice, little; his sense of honour, none at all; no government in his state of society; no security for individual or national engagements; that fear pervading the mass, by reaching the feelings, and apprehensions of each individual was the only principle by which they could be governed; that instead of treaties and giving goods, as heretofore, it became us to retaliate by a heavy war against them, and to make known, by feeling, our superior strength. Such were the arguments on each side of this question; when the Captain looking at Teague, and observing that he was anxious to advance his opinion, assenting with a bow, or inclination of his head, he seemed to signify that he might speak. But before we hear him, it will be necessary to observe, that during the preceding arguments, the company had taken notice of him, as he sat beside the Captain with a mug of beer before them; and had wondered in their own minds, who he could be; for though he was a little brushed up by this time, as may be supposed, having been at the levee, and taught to dance, and received lessons of delicacy, and what not; nevertheless, there was still an uncoothness in his appearance that could not be all at once shaken off. “His form had yet not lost all her original roughness: nor appeared less than a paddy dressed; and the excess of rusticity removed.” He therefore the more easily engaged attention, when raising his voice, he addressed them as follows: Plase your honours, said he; I have heard of dese Indians, when I was trating with the Captain my master. I came acrass one o' dem, who affer'd a hundred dallars for my scoolp; he was going to a traty here abouts. But my good master the Captain took my part, and didn't let him take it aff; de vile savages! O! I have heard of dese Indians; plase your honours; they come out of de woods, and stale shape, like de rabbers in Ireland, and burn houses, and take scoolps; trate wid dese! I would trate wid dem, wid a good shelelah, or a tomahawk to break der heads. Give dem goods! by Shaint Patrick, I would give dem a good bullet hole in deir faces; or shoot dem trough de backside for deir pains. If I was in Cangress, and God love your shouls, I wish you would put me dere, I would make a law to coot dem aff, every one o' dem. O! if my uncle Phelim, and my cousins Dennis and Dermot, and my brother Murtock, and de oder boys was here, we would chase dem, as you would chase one of deir own shape; and keep dem aff de country, and send dem home to eat paratoes. God love your shouls, raise a good party and go out upon dem, and bring dem to de coort, and not let dem be staling shape, and taking scoolps from de poor people. You tink to plase dem, by spaking good words to dem. Spake a good cudgel upon der heads, and bid dem be asy dear honies, and keep at deir homes, and plant paratoes, and be hang'd in deir own country; plase your honours. Trate wid dem! Trate wid de woolves or de bears, dat roon troo de woods: I would trate wid a good knock in deir troat, and be doon wid dem. From the manner in which he spoke, of having been in danger of losing his scalp, and the Captain rescuing him, it was understood that he had been in a campaign against the Indians, and his fervour was excused, and thought natural. Those particularly who were for using force against the savages, thought the Irish gentleman had spoken very well. Encouraged with this success, the bog-trotter was confirmed in his opinion, that he was fit for any political appointment; and the Captain himself, began to entertain better hopes of his advances than he had yet done. CHAP. II. Though I am not employed in political affairs; or, meaning to make my book a treatise of finance; yet I may be indulged in a few remarks on the preceding subjects. I am far from being greatly confident that I am right; nevertheless I will acknowledge that in the case of the certificates, I always found myself inclined to have made a discrimination. It seems to me that even on the principles of the municipal law, it would have been justifiable. Let us apply the chancery decisions to the case of the contract between the original holders, and the transferrees. In a court of equity, a contract will be set aside on the principle of, 1st. Fraud. 2d. The unconscionableness of the bargain. 3d. The being against the public interest, and good policy. 1st. Fraud: And in this case, it is not necessary to prove express fraud: presumptive is sufficient. “This court, meaning the court of chancery, says lord chancellor Hardwicke, will relieve against presumptive fraud, so that equity goes farther than the rule of law; for there fraud must be proved, and not presumed only.” 1st Atkins 352. To apply this principle in our case. Is there not presumption of fraud, where the holder of a certificate parts with it for a little more than the tenth of what is really due upon it? But it is well known that actual and express fraud, did in general exist in the traffic in these securities, the purchasers, individually, or in combination with others, decrying the credit of the government, and depreciating as much as possible, the value of the certificates. But the same great chancellor, lays it down, that “To take an advantage of another man's necessity is equally bad as taking advantage of his weakness, and in such situation, as incapable of making a right use of his reason, as in the other. Fraud has been constantly presumed, or inferred from circumstances, and conditions of parties; weakness and necessity on the one side, and extortion and avarice, on the other; and merely from the intrinsic unconscionableness of the bargain. There are hard unconscionable bargains, which have been construed fraudulent, and there are instances, where even the common law hath relieved for this reason expressly.” 1st Atkins 352. 2d. But the bare unconscionableness of the bargain, all idea of fraud out of the question, would be sufficient to set aside the contract in a court of equity. Sir John Strange, the master of the rolls in the court of chancery lays it down; that “there may be cases where this court will interpose to prevent improvident persons from ruining themselves, before the expectancy falls into possession, though no express fraud or imposition appears.” 1st Atkins 346. But let it be supposed that the contract was equal, and conscionable at the time of making it; the one taking a small sum certain, and the other receiving the uncertainty of a large sun.; yet has it not become unconscionable by the event? Did any purchaser ever expect to be paid the whole nominal sum, in gold or silver? The ideas of the time must be yet fresh in every man's mind; and we well know that no man was so sanguine as to expect this. It was supposed that something might be done towards paying the interest at a future day, or lands in the western country, might be obtained for them. But whatever the purchaser might think, no seller did imagine that for one-third, or one-half of a dollar, he was transferring twenty or twenty five shillings. It was not in the contemplation of the parties to lose so much on the one side, or gain so much on the other. It is an unexpected event that has put it in the power of the public to do more in making a provision for the payment of the public debt, than could at that time be foreseen. What is more; it is an event brought about by the joint efforts of the original holder and the tranferree; I mean a new constitution of government, under which the legislature of the states having the command of all resources, was able to make a better provision for these debts. It is unreasonable, and unconscionable that the transferree should take all the advantage of this event? Let any man putting a thousand dollars in his pocket from the bank of the United States, look at the war-worn soldier, or the widow and fatherless who has parted with them, and say if his conscience is not touched with a sense of the unreasonable gain. If it is not, it ought to be. At any rate, on the principle of unreasonableness, a contract of such undue advantage, would not be sanctioned by the law. The 3d. Ground is that of the public interest, and good policy. Lord Hardwicke lays it down, “that political arguments, in the fullest sense of the word, as they concern the government of a nation must, and have always been of great weight in the consideration of this court (the court of chancery) and though there may be no dolus malus in the contract, as to other persons; yet, if the rest of mankind are concerned, as well as the parties, it may properly be said that it regards the public utility.” 1st Atkins 352. There can be nothing more hurtful to a people than sudden losses, and sudden gains to individuals. Happiness depends on a gradual accession of attainment. Perhaps a sudden loss inflicting with melancholy, is not more hurtful, than sudden great gains, hurrying into a situation for which the mind is not gradually qualified. But sudden gains out of the way of common industry, affect the sensations of others, who partake not; and feel chagrin and dissatisfaction with their state in life. Such gains sap the foundation of common industry. For what man will be equally content to labour in his vocation, and pursue the common means of a livelihood when he sees his neighbour all at once, by some fortunate cast, so far before him in his acquisitions. It is on this principle that our legislatures have prohibited gaming, lotteries, &amp;c. In the natural world there is a gradation in all things. Animals grow to their size in a course of years; trees and plants, have their progress; Jonah's ground might spring up in a night by a miracle; but in general all the productions of nature have a regular period of increase. The attainments of men are made to depend usually upon their industry. As ye sow, so shall ye reap. In well regulated societies this œconomy is imitated, and where one estate comes by accident, five hundred are acquired by common means. Such an institution of things constitutes the health of any people. On all or any of these grounds, therefore, fraud, unconscionableness, or sound policy, a contract of the nature in question, would have been set aside on a bill in the chancery of England, and in our courts, the contract would not be established against the original holder of a certificate: or on payment to the transferree, an action would lie to the original holder, counting for money had and received to his use, and demanding all above the sum originally paid, and with legal interest from the date. But it will occur, that there were in most cases a number of transferrees between the original holder, and the then possessor. The impracticability of making these answerable to the original holder, for their respective proportions of the undue gain, will put them out of the question. The case would then have stood between the original holder and the last transferree. Shall he be answerable to the original holder for all the intermediate gains? No. But let him take no more than the then selling price of the certificates. It became the legislature in the first instance to have ascertained the current value of the public securities, and to have made provision for the redemption of them in the hands of the transferrees, at that value and no more; but in the hands of the original holders, at the full specie value; and let the sum saved from transferrees go to the original holders who had transferred. Was it practicable that these could be ascertained? Let the proof lie on the original holders; and where it could not be made, let the public be the gainers. As to the assumption of the state debts, perhaps, it would be adviseable for me to be as silent as the bog-trotter; as it is possible, I may not have a perfect knowledge of the question. But from the knowledge I have on the subject, it has appeared to me I will not say an unjust, but an impolitic measure. If more were led to look to the general government, and to depend upon it, as being the general debtor; yet with this it took the odium of imposing duties to discharge the whole. It would have been as well perhaps, to have left the states themselves, to enact excise laws, or to devise whatever other ways and means, they thought proper while the imposts, which the United States had now got in their collective capacity, would have been sufficient to have answered the continental debt where they were the immediate contractors. There is that advantage in a public debt, that the fortunes of many are made to depend on the existence of the government; but as there, in the nature of things, can be but few, in proportion to the whole, there will be in that proportion, a greater number to be affected with the payment, and to be careless of the existence of the government, or to wish a dissolution of it. When that debt, as in the present instance, by the necessiries of the distressed, the distrust of the credulous, and opportunities of the knowing, has come to be in few hands; after having passed from the most deserving, at a small value it exists with an odium upon it in the public mind, which naturally transfers itself to all ways and means that can be devised for the discharge of it. At the same time that it is well to brace the government, and secure its strength, it is an object of equal moment to preserve it popular: affection, as well as power, are the bands of authority. As to the bank incorporation, I shall only say, that the doctrine of insering powers by implication, is extremely dangerous, and may easily be carried to overthrow all the boundaries of any constitution. I think it much the most adviseable, when the case is doubtful, to wait until the same authority by which the constitution is established, shall have declared its sense on the subject. For otherwise, except as to the form of a government, independent of its powers, a constitution will be of no use. A transgression of the constitution is the breach at which tyranny enters; and of all things it is the most difficult thing to preserve a constitution inviolate. The Council of Censors in Pennsylvania, was a means, and I think a good one. They did themselves honour in the report they made with respect to the violation of the constitution, though the spirit of party prevented them from going far enough. Under the United States there is but one means, and that is the decision of the judiciary. The judges have done themselves honour in a late case where they had the independence to declare a law void which they considered as unconstitutional. In the case of the bank, would not a writ of quo warranto lie. I can have no doubt of it; and, I may be mistaken, but I can have no doubt but that the judges would find themselves bound to declare the act in question not within the powers granted to the United States, and therefore void. As to Indian treaties, having occasionally in this work, insinuated my ideas, it may seem a repetition to say any thing more on the subject. Indeed the objection may lie in general against the work, that certain subjects, such as the Philosophical Society, Popular Preaching, Indian Treaties, &amp;c. have been too often introduced. To this, I have to answer, that it has been the system I proposed, not to exhaust a subject all at once, but to touch it for the present, and introduce it afterwards in a different point of view, where such things might be added, as would otherwise originally have been brought in; just as, in order to preserve a relish for the same food, we do not dine upon it in continuance, but having had veal to day, take pork to-morrow, and the third day return to veal again. Having certain ideas to inculcate, I bring them forward at various times, and in different shapes, with front, flank, rear, corps de reserve, &amp;c. As the human mind, from defect of attention, or incapacity, cannot be reached all at once, in the manner of the prophet, imitating his zeal, and knowledge of the heart, I give “line upon line; precept upon precept; here a little, and there a little.” This will be my apology, for touching the subject of Indian treaties again in this volume. On this subject I lay down these principles; that an Indian is a man, and you may bind him by kind words and good acts. But he is an ignorant, uninlightened man, and when you lose the affections of his heart, you have little hold upon his reason to recover it: Respect for you, in the first case, is the ground of his attachment; fear of you in the last, must be your means to reclaim him. Hence it depends upon circumstances when a treaty is expedient, and when a war is necessary. Apply this to our present situation with the Indians. At the conclusion of the war with the British, we were thought to be conquerors: though the savages were kept in the dark with respect to the stipulated surrender of the posts on the lakes, and the cession of the Indian country by their allies, yet it had transpired among them that we had been successful against the great king; hence a fear of us was impressed, and it was expedient to treat. We did treat, and after some interval, as will always be the case, war, again took place. They have have had the advantage. This is not, therefore, the crisis to treat. Amongst ourselves, do we not find, that if you yield to the imposition of an ignorant man, he will attribute it to your want of discernment to observe it; whereas, on your part, it was to avoid all contention with a low person. If you are insulted by an ignorant man, he will attribute it to your cowardice, that you do not challenge him, whereas, it is an unwillingness to have your name mentioned with his, as having had a dispute at all. If you attempt to negociate a contract with an ignorant man, and ask him just what you ought to ask, he proposes less than he otherwise would have done; and not until you convince him, that you are at a world, in these matters, will you induce him to agree to what is reasonable. A small success with an ignorant man, against an adversary, will give him hopes, which the occasion does not justify; because he does not comprehend the principles, and see how much accident, or causes that may not exist again, had to do in the business. It is therefore like selling a fowl in a rainy day, to attempt negociating with an ignorant man, when his imagination is not corrected by an experience of facts against him. It is on the principles of human nature, that I found my ideas of managing the Indians. I would deprecate a treaty at present, because it could not be permanent. We are in a fair way, to bring things to a state in which it might be adviseable to treat. Let the event be what it may, I am one of those who not only approve of the present war against the Indians, but also of the principle on which it is carried on, viz. by a body of regular and well disciplined troops. It is suggested by some, that the militia would be adequate. What? Because in the course of the war against the British, when we had not disciplined troops at all times, and in sufficient numbers to oppose to the enemy, the militia of necessity were obliged to act, and sometimes acted well, will it be said that they were preferable to the disciplined troops? we know they were not, though occasionally they discovered bravery, and were obedient to orders. But supposing them equal; what is more, supposing them preferable; are the inhabitants of the western country, to be perpetually harrassed with militia duty? To be subject to the necessity of quiting their occupations, and to be occasionally soldiers? Did not the militia during the war with Britain, groan under the necessity of being obliged to act? And shall this grievance exist to the western country, ten years after that war has been terminated; and when it is in the power of the government, knowing the seat of war with the savages, to have regular troops to oppose them; not as in the case of the British, where by means of their flects, the war was suddenly transferable from place to place, and the militia were obliged to act, in order to assist the parts of our army, until a greater force should arrive. Militia! That is, let every man do his own fighting. Why not every man his smithing, masoning, weaving, and tayloring, as well? Because it will be better to have persons who will make a business of each particular branch, and stick to it. It does not do to be a Jack of all trades. Well, and why plow a spell, and then fight? But the riflemen of the western country, are the best calculated to fight the Indians. Well: enlist such, and give them rifles, and make an abiding body of them, that the country may have a permanent force to depend upon. But they will not enlist. I engage it, if you pay them well. When militia are called upon they are not those that are drafted that go; they are substitutes. They cost high to those that employ them; and being the refuse of the country, they are good for nothing when they are employed. But let those that are drafted go. Well; draft them from the inland parts of the government, that have not families to defend on the frontiers, and see what will then be said. Volunteers are the thing, making a sudden incursion. If they make a sudden incursion, they will make a sudden recursion, and leave the matter as they found it. A large army cannot find the Indians. They will run away. Well, stay till they come back. Occupy the country; and occupying it, then prepare to treat. Treating at their own towns you will not be imposed upon by raggamuffins passing for chiefs; or tribes treating who are at peace already, and are so situated that they dare not go to war. But the western country is not worth defending at the expence of a standing army. Give it up then; absolve us from our allegiance, and let us make terms with the British who have the command of the Indians. For an army at least equal to the present establishment must be kept up; otherwise all the treaties that can be made, will be of no avail; for a present visible force is the only sanction of engagements, with the savages; more especially in their present situation, impelled, and supported by the traders of Britain. I will not say how far the government takes a part, as there are different opinions on this subject. But it is not the western country only that you are defending. It is the very sea coast settlements. For if we give way, and return to the east of the mountains, will not the enemy come to the east after us? If he finds no horses or blankets, on the one side, will he not pursue his rout to the other? If he misses a scalp short of the Schuylkill, will it not do to take it there? The fact is, that the command of lake Erie, by posts established upon it, and from thence to the Wabash, are the only means of repressing the Indians; not so much from the actual force of these establishments as from the effect upon the imagination of the enemy; for seeing the boldness of the step, they will count more upon our force than they ought; as at present they count less; and it will refute the British traders, who deny the cession of the country made by that government. But more especially, by encouraging our traders under the protection of our posts, a commerce will be established with the savages, under the nose of the British, and we may equally have the direction of them. Surely any man of the smallest reflection must know, that a treaty and giving goods, is but a transitory act, and can have but a transitory effect; whereas the means that will reduce, and the interests that will conciliate, ought to be permanent to be of any use.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">BOOK III. CHAP. I. The circumstance of having been at the levee, and having made a speech in the beer-house, which had been much approved, and above all, it being announced that he was a candidate for state employment, had made the bog-trotter a pretty general theme of conversation. Sundry persons who were expectants upon government, had procured themselves to be introduced to him, as supposing that when in office, by and bye, he might have it in his power to do them service. Even by those that were in government, in the legislative, executive, or diplomatic line, he was not neglected. Several members of Congress had left cards. Assistants, and deputy assistants in offices, foreign consuls, two or three directors and cashiers of banks, had waited upon him and paid him their compliments. His name became known in the gay world, and by a gradual introduction, he had become acquainted in some of the best families of the city. The ladies, in general, were much taken with him. They thought him a plain, frank, blunt spoken Irish gentleman; not harrassing them with deep observations, drawn from books, or an ostentation of learning; but always saying something gallant, and complimentary of their persons, or accomplishments; such as God love your shoul, my dear cratur, but you are de beauty of de world. Sleeping or waking, I could take you to my heart, and ate you wid de very love o' d' my shoul dat I have for you. De look o' d' dur face, like de sun or de moon, run trugh me, and burn up like a coal o' d' de fire; dat I am shick and fainting to take du to my arms, my dear cratur. Declarations of this nature, made without any ambiguity, and warm and violent in their nature, had rendered him, as I have said, pretty generally a favorite of the ladies: far indeed beyond any thing which the Captain, simple and ignorant of the world, had ever imagined: his astonishment therefore was not small, a day or two after this, when walking the street, he saw a carriage, pass by, with a gentleman and lady; and on asking whose carriage that was, and who the gentleman that was in it; for he was struck with some resemblance of the bog-trotter; it was answered, that it was the carriage of Mr. Haberdasher, a merchant of the city, whose lady was taking an airing it would seem with Major O'Regan, a member of Congress, or Ambassador, or something that was just come to town. God Almighty! thought the Captain; is it possible. I see that I have been a fool, all my life, and though just going out of the world, am but beginning to get experience to live in it. I had been led by his own confidence, and by the opinion of others, though with great doubts, on my part, to suppose it possible that he might have come to be of some respect in government, the discharge of an office, requiring rather solid, than brilliant parts; but that in so short a time, or indeed, after any period, he should become a favorite of females of taste and fashion, never entered into my head at all: and forsooth they have given him the appellation of Major, though he is about as much a Major as my horse. Such were the ideas which the circumstance of Teague in a carriage with a fine lady, naturally produced in his mind. Nor indeed should we think them unreasonable, were it not that we know there was nothing extraordinary in the case. For though abstractedly considered, it would seem improbable that the female mind of great delicacy, and refinement, should be captivated by a rough and gross object; yet we know that the fact is in nature, and we must leave it to the philosophers to account for it. Nor will this be any difficult task, when we consider the powers of imagination. Here was a new object, unknown as to its origin, and high as to its pretensions; and what is novel, and not fully comprehended, and lofty in its nature, has a supereminent dominion over the human mind. Hence the proverb, “far fetched, and dear bought, is good for ladies.” But on the present occasion, a particular principle operated in favour of the bog-trotter: viz. the taste and fashion of the day. For, as, in the age of chivalry, a knight was the only object in request, and at the beginning of the revolution in America, a Baron, or a Count from France or Germany was the ton, so now, since the adoption of the federal constitution, the appurtenant officers of government are the only characters in vogue. And as in the first instance, mere squires had been taken for knights, and passed very well, and in the second case, taylors and barbers, had slurred themselves for gentry or nobility, what could hinder the bog-trotter from availing himself of the whim of the day, and be taken for a person qualified to fill any place in government, from the bare pretending to it? And being once taken for such, what prodigy was there in his being in request with the females, and all the first families of the city, who might be ambitious, and vie with each other, in having him married to a niece or a daughter, that so being raised above plebians by the connection, they might be considered as of a pratrician degree? Let the principle be what it would, whether taste, or ambition, the fact was, that the bog-trotter was courted and carressed by all the first people: there could be no card party without Major O'Regan. A young lady sitting by a gentleman in any house, and seeing him pass by, would start up, and run to the window and say, O, there is Major O'Regan. When he was in company, and would laugh, and put out his tongue, as if he was about to sing, Lilibullero, the young ladies would laugh too; not that there was any jest, in what he or they said, but just because the Major had laughed. When he would put out his great paw to touch the hand of any of them, O, la! Major, one would say, O, now! Major, another would say; don't now Major, a third would exclaim, rather to attract his attention, than to repress his advances. The fact was, there seemed to be a kind of Teagueomania, amongst the females, so that all idea of excellence, personal, or mental was centered in him, and all common lovers, were neglected, or repulsed on his account. A melancholy instance of this kind occured to the Captain the following day, when walking by the margin of the river on which the city stood, and towards a grove of wood, which skirted it on the south, he observed a man sitting on a tuft of the bank, with his head reclining forward, in a melancholy position, and looking down upon the wave beneath him, in the manner in which Achilles is described by the poet Homer, as looking on the purple ocean, and complaining to the goddess Thetis of the injury done to him, when the maid Brisfeis had been taken from his arms by the order of Agamemnon. Sensibly touched with an appearance of woe in any case, the Captain could not avoid advancing, and accosting him: Sir, said he,----but what need I take up the time of the reader with stating particularly the words of the address: it is sufficient to say, that with all the necessary delicacy, the captain gave him to understand that he took a part in his misfortune, if there was any upon his mind, and would think himself extremely fortunate if by language, or acts, he could alleviate his griefs. Sir, said the other, it is impossible. I am an unhappy man, who have been for some months in love with a young lady of this city, and whose affections I had conceived myself to have engaged by the most unremitting attention. I had counted upon her, as my wife, and in all my industry in business, which is that of a merchant, I had my thoughts directed to the provision, I hoped, to have it in my power, to make, in order to support her with dignity and affluence. Yet within these few days, her attention is engaged, and her affections alienated by a certain Major O'Regan, that is, or, is about to be engaged in some public employment. Major O'Regan, said the Captain, laughing; is it possible! Do you know him, said the gentleman? Know him, said the Captain; he is my bog-trotter; he has been my valet de chambre this three years; and of late my hostler and boot cleaner, in my travels to this city. I believe I could prevail with him for a pair of breeches, or so, to resign his pretensions to the lady. At this, the eye of the inamorato began to resume its lustre; and the paleness of his countenance to give way to some freshness of complexion. Give me your name, and the name of the lady, said the Captain, and call upon me to morrow, at the Indian Queen, about nine o'clock, and I will endeavor to make such terms on your behalf with this same Major O'Regan, that he will give you no farther trouble, on the score of the lady. The inamorato expressed his thankfulness with great animation and fervour; and accepted the invitation to wait upon him at the time and place proposed, informing him, at the same time, that his name was Williams, and that of the lady, was M`Cracken, a daughter of an alderman of the city of that name. The Captain coming home, addressed the bog-trotter as follows: Major O'Regan, said he, for that I find is the title which they have given you, there is a young lady of this town of the name of M`Cracken, whom you have by some means engaged to think favorably of you, to the neglect of a former admirer, a Mr. Williams, a merchant, of this city. This gentleman had a claim upon her from a prior attention, and though there is no municipal law that constitutes it a wrong in you to interfere; yet humanity will dictate that it is a wrong. Because it is a small thing to a man whose affections are not engaged; and who has yet wasted no time upon an object, to decline attention to it, or relinquish it. But to him who has set his mind upon this or that lady, it is death to be repulfed, and a man of honor and delicacy of feeling, who sees the advances of another which are well received, will not interfere, even though the object might be agreeable to him. Much less will he amuse himself at the expence of another, by paying attention when it is his own vanity alone that he consults, in shewing in what point of view he could stand if he should think proper to persist. I hope better things of you Teague, and that you will conduct yourself on the principles of honour and humanity; you will resign this flirt, for such I deem her, who ---- he was going to say, who could be tickled with you; but having a point to carry with Teague, he chose to use soft words; who, continued he, could so readily change one lover for another. What security have you of the affections of one of so versatile a mind, Mr. Williams is a merchant, and has cloths in his store: he will give you the pattern of a pair of breeches to decline your pretensions, and resign the jade to him who had first cast his eye upon her. Teague, much more from this last part of the argument, than from the fine sentiments of delicacy, &amp;c. which were laid down in the first of it, consented to relinquish the dulcinea; and so when Mr. Williams called at the hour proposed, an order for the making of a pair of breeches was given and the bog-trotter pledged his word, that he neither would laugh, talk, walk, or ogle with her any more. Shortly after this, while reading a newspaper, the Captain heard two men conversing at the opposite end of the saloon in which they sat, one of them expressing his concern that having a cause to be tried before the court then sitting, his lawyer Mr. Hardicknute could not attend, being indisposed, and as it was alledged, from a disappointment in love, by a Miss Thimbleton, who was of late, as it appeared, taken with a certain Major O'Regan, an Irish gentleman of some note, who had paid attention to her. Enquiring the residence of the gentleman, and being informed, the Captain ever prompt to do offices of humanity, immediately calling for Teague, who was in the bar room with the waiter getting him to write a love letter for him, set out on a visit to lawyer Hardicknute, and being admitted to his chamber, where he lay languishing in bed, accosted him, giving him to understand that he knew the cause of his complaint, not by feeling his pulse as did the physician of Demetrius, who was in love with Stratonice: nor by any power of conjuring; but simply by hearing it from a client who was interested in his recovery; and that in consequence of this information he had come to relieve him, and had brought the identical Major O'Regan along with him, who for half a johannes was ready to resign all pretensions to the lady. This the Captain presumed, from his influence with the Irishman, and from his succeeding on the former occasion. The sick lawyer at this sat up; and having put on on his gown and slippers, expressed great thanks to the Captain and the Major, and very readily handed a half johannes from his bureau, and calling for pen, ink and paper, for he was not sufficiently restored to go to his office, he signified that it would be proper the Major should give him some instrument of writing as evidence of the contract. It was agreed on the part of the Captain and the bog-trotter; and the lawyer wrote as follows: “Know all men by these presents, that I Teague O'Regan, Major, am held and firmly bound unto John Hardicknute, in the sum of one hundred pounds, money of the United States, well and truly to be paid to him the said John, his heirs, executors, administators, or assigns. Given under my hand and seal this second day of June, in the year of our Lord one thousand seven hundred and ninety-one. The condition of the above obligation is such, That if I the said Teague O'Regan, shall withdraw all attention, courtship, or wooing on my behalf from a certain Martha Thimbleton, lady, then the said obligation to be void, otherwise to remain in full force and virtue. his TEAGUE O'REGAN mark. Signed, sealed and delivered in the presence of JOHN FARRAGO. This matter being fully settled, the Captain and the bog-trotter took their leave and departed. On their way home, a man was seen to run across the street, dressed in black, but without hat, coat, or breeches on. The Captain conceived it must be some mad sans culotte, or unbreeched person that had come over from Paris, and was running through the streets here in order to bring about a revolution; but on enquiry, he was informed, that it was the Revd. Mr. M`Whorter, a young clergyman, who had been deranged in his understanding on account of a preference given by Miss Fiddle to a certain Major O'Regan, who had seemed to have engaged her affections; that it was first discovered on the preceding Sunday, when in his prayer, instead of saying “give us this day our daily bread,” he repeated, give us this day our daily Miss Fiddle, and instead of saying, “deliver us from evil,” as he ought to have done, he said, deliver us from Major O'Regan; that ever since he had been getting worse, and now had thrown off a part of his garments, and exposing himself in public, appeared to be mad altogether. The Captain thinking on the subject, was about to parody that line of the poet and to say; Ye Gods what havock does O'Regan make Amongst your works. But repressing all poetical flights, he wished to lose no time, but as speedily as possible to wait upon the unfortunate ecclesiastic, and by satisfying his mind, remove his derangement. Accordingly pursuing the clergyman, and having had him seized and conveyed to a chamber; he endeavored to make him sensible that Major O'Regan, the cause of his misfortune, who was there present, was ready to quit claim to Miss Fiddle, and give him no cause of uneasiness any farther. For this, on their way, the bog-trotter, in consideration of an interest in the clergyman's prayers, had promised to do. But poor Mr. M`Whorter was too far gone. He could talk of nothing, but some incoherent jargon consisting of a mixture of scripture and profane language, one while about Miss Fiddle and Major O'Regan; another while of Daniel in the Lion's den, and Jonas in the whale's belly, and the Devil running into swine. He would imagine sometimes that the devil was in himself, and would squeel like a pig. The matter being thus hopeless, they set off to come home. On their way they fell in with a man who called himself a doctor, and had a blistering plaister in his hand, and a gallipot, and a clyster pipe tyed with a string about his neck, and hanging down his back, and had alarmed two or three ladies just before, offering his services in the way of his profession. On enquiry, it was found, that it was the celebrated doctor Cataplasm that had lost his senses, within three days past, on account of a Major O'Regan, that was likely to carry off Miss Blasm, to whom the doctor had been a suitor for several years, and with whom he had been just on the point of marriage. Despairing from the late experiment of doing any thing with mad people, the Captain waved any trouble with the doctor, but looking sternly at Teague; this will never do, said he: I cannot reconcile it to myself to be in the most distant way accessary to so much mischief; and as, from a deference to the judgment of others, and to your importunity, I have suffered myself to be the means of introducing you to this sphere, I must take care to repair the injury as far as may be in my power, or at least prevent any increase of it as much as possible. If there is some talismanic charm, God knows what it is, in your person or appearance, that makes you thus formidable to the peace and happiness of others in giving this success amongst the females, and if you have not generosity, or moral sense of duty, to use your advantage consistent with humanity, it is full time you should be checked and drawn from this sphere altogether, and sent to your former bog-trotting, or put into the state if you can get there, that honest men may marry their wenches, whose affections they had previously engaged. The bog-trotter was somewhat obstreperous; or as the vulgar say, obstrapalous, on the occasion; and seemed to signify that he would not desist; but would pay attention to whom he thought proper. The Captain saw that it was a difficult matter to lay the devil he had raised; and his hopes rested in this, that he was but the bubble of a day, and that though light-headed young women in the unfortunate cases mentioned, had given him a visible preference, yet it was rather to torture their former lovers with a view to try the strength of their passion than with any intention seriously to make choice of him, and finally accept him for a husband. For he could not think it possible that a woman of fashion, and education, would ultimately be willing to give her hand to such a raggamussin. If indeed, he could come to be a judge, or a governor, such a thing might take place; but as it was, it seemed to outrage all credibility. In this he was mistaken; for but the very next day, he was waited on by Mr. Mutchkin, a merchant of the city, who was in the wholesale and retail way as a grocer, and who had an only daughter, Miss Mutchkin, to whom the Irishman had made his most serious proposals. It was to her, by the assistance of the waiter, that he had been writing love letters: Mr. Mutchkin, a cautious man, before he would give his consent to the match, thought proper to call upon the Captain, whom he understood to be the uncle, or guardian of the young gentleman, with a view of enquiring into his expectations. Expectations! said the Captain, why just this; that if he should chance to get into office, it is well, and if not he must return to his bog-trotting. Bog-trotting! said the merchant. Aye; bog-trotting, said the Captain: what else would he do. It is but ten days, or thereabouts, since he quitted it; and since, by taking him to levees, and beer-houses, and rubbing and scrubbing him, and teaching him to dance, and giving him some lessons of manners, he has been made fit to appear in the gay world. He has but that pair of breeches that you see to his backside, and a pattern not made up yet, that merchant Williams gave him; and for my part I have done all for him that I can do: There is just the truth Mr. Mutchkin; and if you chuse to take him for a son-in-law, you are welcome; but as, thank God, I have preserved a principle of candour and honesty all my life, I will not deceive on this occasion; and if the match should prove unfortunate, you will not have me to blame, Mr. Mutchkin, expressed by the staring of his eye, his astonishment; and as soon as he could speak, thanked the Captain for his candour, and declared his resolution that if Major O'Regan as he had the assurance to call himself, should again come to his house, he would turn him out of doors; and that if his daughter should give him the least countenance for the future, he would disown her entirely: He had taken the greatest pains with her in her education; she had been taught all the polite accomplishments that could become a lady; dancing, music, painting, reading French, the Belles Lettres, geography, &amp;c. and if, after all this, she would throw herself away on a raggamuffin to the discredit of the family, he would no longer take notice of her. Fair, and softly, said the Captain; I have a word of advice to give on the subject. It is true, I have not travelled much through the world; so as to visit France, Italy, Spain, or Portugal; nevertheless, I have some general knowledge of the principles of human nature; not only from books, but from my own observations, of the small circumstances that have fallen in my way, and reflection upon them; and have found, that in the intellectual province, as well as in material works, art accomplishes more than force; nay, as in mechanism, the arch is strengthened by the very weight you put upon it, so, where the imagination is concerned, the attachment is fixed by an opposition to it. Hence, it is, that the dissuasion of parents, guardians, or friends is often so ineffectual, with their daughters or wards, in matters of love. It will behoove you, on this occasion, in order to accomplish your object, to conceal your knowledge of the circumstances communicated; to allow the bog-trotter free ingress and egress as usual, and to affect to speak of him with respect. Leave it to me to say such things to the young lady, as under pretence of recommending her lover, will be effectual to disgust her, and remove her attachment, Mr. Mutchkin impressed with the sincerity and good sense of the Captain, consented to be guided by him in this business, and accordingly going home was silent to the mother and daughter with respect to the conversation he had with the old gentleman, who was considered as the uncle of Teague: and the following day when the Captain waited upon the family, and was introduced by Mr. Mutchkin, who retiring under pretence of business, left him alone with the daughter and mother to make use of the means he had proposed. For Mr. Mutchkin well knew that O'Regan was a great favorite with the mother; and that it would be as difficult to convince her as the daughter, of the imposition in his character. Nay, as she had promoted the match, her pride, unless she herself was the first to detect the imposture, would hinder her from seeing it, or at least acknowledging it at all. Being seated, conversation ensued, and Mrs. Mutchkin, paid the Captain many compliments on the fine figure and address of his nephew. Miss Mutchkin, hung down her head, and blushed, as being in the presence of the uncle of her lover and hearing the name of Major O'Regan mentioned. Why madam, said the Captain, I understand that the bog-trotter, has been well received in your family. It is true I am not his uncle, nor is he a Major; nevertheless many uncles have had worse nephews; and there have been Majors that did not perhaps ever see so much service: for I have understood from himself that he was inlisted once when he was drunk, and was a while in the barracks in Dublin; but got off when the matter came to be examined, and it was found that advantage had been taken of him. For the Lord Lieutenant had given strict orders, that in the enlistments the utmost fairness should be used; nor, indeed was it necessary in time of peace, to take advantage; because there were men enough to be got voluntarily, and deliberately to enter the service. Nor indeed had Teague himself any objections to be a soldier, but that his constitution had not given him that courage which is necessary to enable a man to face an enemy with fire arms: He could cudgel at a fair, or the like, where he was supported by others that would take the weight of the battle off his hands; but except to wrestle at carnish hug, as he calls it, with a hostler, now and then, I never knew him fond of any contention whatsoever. I understand that he has been fortunate enough to render himself agreeable to the young lady your daughter, and I congratulate myself on the prospect of having so accomplished a young woman to be the wife of my domestic. I have had him now these three years. I bought him out a ship of Irish servants. He has been always faithful to me in the offices in which I employed him, such as brushing boots, and rubbing down my horse. It is true his manners were a little rude at first, but I have taken a good deal of pains to teach him some of the outlines of a decent behaviour, such as to blow his nose with a handkerchief, and keep from breaking wind in company, a practice to which he was a good deal addicted at his first setting out; and though he takes long strides as you may see, from wearing brogues, and bog-trotting; yet in the course of time, this and other habits may be broke, by being in good company. He has made considerable improvement in the short time, I have taken pains with him. Though but ten days since he was heaved down, and curried and brushed up for a gentleman, he has learned to chew food, without greasing his chin and cheeks. If he should fall into the hands of a lady of taste, as he is like to do, she may improve him still more. It will be of particular advantage to him to get a woman that can write and read; as I understand Miss Mutchkin can do very well; for as he can neither read nor write himself, it is necessary that there should be one of a family that can. He has been fortunate at the taverns where we lodged to get the waiters to write and read billets to ladies; but such cannot be always at hand for these things; but a wife may. It is true his hopes in government are uncertain, as to being an ambassador or consul, but he may get to be a valet de chambre to one of these: and though the ambition of Miss Mutchkin may not be so much flattered, as to be the lady of a minister, yet true happiness is to be found in contentment; and the love she has for his person, may make amends for the want of rank and honor; much more for the want of fortune; for riches are but dross, and the maid of a kitchen may be as happy as the mistress in the parlour. His fortune indeed is not much. He has nothing of his own, but what dress he wears, and a pattern of a pair of breeches, not yet made up. My estate is but small, consisting in a farm, and implements of husbandry, with a couple of horses, one of which I have rode from home, while he bog-trotted by my side. Nevertheless, if he marries Miss Mutchkin I will endeavor to do something for him, and for two or three years to come will engage to find him in breeches and waistcoats. The young lady was confounded and withdrew. The mother was silent, and with all her heart wished the Captain gone, that she might digest her mortification in private. The Captain saw all this; but without seeming to see it, preserved a grave countenance, and with some apology of having an engagement so that he could not have the honor of a longer conversation, he took his leave. The dialogue that took place after this between the mother and the daughter, may be more easily imagined than expressed. It was concluded that when O'Regan came next to the house, the porter should be ready with a cowskin to give him a suitable reception. Mr. Mutchkin coming in was made acquainted with the discovery of Major O'Regan's history. Affecting to be as much astonished as themselves, he observed, that it would be however proper to dismiss him with civility, as he had been received in the capacity of a suitor. Here Miss Mutchkin again blushed, not as at first, with an affected blush of modesty, when Major O'Regan was at any time mentioned, but with the blush of confusion and shame. The mother discovering in her countenance all the emotions of wounded pride, and ungovernable resentment, avowed her determination to have him received with a cowskin by the porter. Mr. Mutchkin, affecting to acquiesce, as these were matters in which he did not wish to concern, did but confirm the resolution. Accordingly, that evening, when the bog-trotter being on the point of marriage as he thought, came to take tea with Miss Mutchkin, ringing the bell, and being admitted, a stout fellow, an Englishman, who served in the capacity of Porter, being prepared with a very heavy cowskin, made an attack upon him. The Irishman exclaimed, and called out for Miss Mutchkin. O! God love your dear ladyship, Miss Mutchkin; by shaint Patrick; by de holy apostles, I shall be kilt and murdered into de bargain! O! I shall be kilt and murdered. God love your shoul stop wid your cowskin, till I say may prayers; and spare my life; O! I shall be kilt and murdered, O! dis night, in de house here. Miss Mutchkin, where is your dear ladyship, to look upon me wid your eyes, and save me from dis bateing? O! I am kilt and murdered. Saying these words the porter had kicked him out of the house, and shutting the door, left him to his exclamations in the street. Coming home, to the Captain, he made a woeful complaint of the disaster that had befallen him; which the Captain took care not to alleviate, but increase, alledging, that it must have been some former lover of the lady, who was exasperated at the preference given, and took this method of revenge; that he now saw how dangerous it was to interfere with men of spirit in their courtships, and he ought to be more careful for the future. CHAP. II Containing Observations. HAVING given the preceding history, and put my name to it, there is no man that knows me, will doubt of the truth of it. For I have always considered the first character of an historian to be veracity; and in all my former compositions, have endeavored to preserve that character. There being therefore no doubt of the facts, it will remain only to account for them, and indeed, though we have partly done it already, in some observations we have made, yet this, and the like circumstances which occur every day in life, of Teague O'Regans and bog-trotters, being the favorites of ladies in preference to the most accomplished men, is so contrary to what we would expect, that it may deserve a more minute developement of the causes and principles. In early times, and even yet amongst simple and uninformed people, the effect has been attributed to love potions, or witchcraft; that is, either to some drug, or draught affecting the nerves, and deranging the brain; or to some supernatural power operating on the faculties. But exploding these, we shall endeavor to explain the phenomenon upon the common principles of the affections of the heart, and the power of the imagination. But it must be presumed that in general, advantage of person, good sense, and virtue prevail with the females, and where the opposite is the case, it is to be considered as out of the common course of choice. Why it ever should be so, may depend on this; that a Teague O'Regan having little sensibility of nerve, has all that apathy from nature which the man of address has from habit, and more steadily, because the one is nature, the other art: and coolness in love, is a great secret of success. Sensibility is irritable, unpersevering, desponding, extravagant; and hence it is that no man who is deeply enamoured of a lady before she has conceived some attachment on her part, has an equal chance to be acceptable. The fond love of a refined mind, produces silliness, in proportion to the delicacy of the feelings; and the contrast being more observable, the wise man becomes, or appears to be the greater fool. The Teague O'Regan makes love without any heart at all; he attends upon a lady as he would tread mortar: flatters her as he would speak to a parrot, or stroke a cat, without a single sensation to disturb him. The appearance of security on the part of the lover, gives the lady to suppose that he is conscious of advantages, and of course that there must be such which she does not yet discover: or conceiving that she has not yet absolutely engaged him, she makes it an object to inspire his attachment, and the very exercise of her own passions kindles a flame; for hopes and fears are the aliments of love. A Teague O'Regan has no sentiment of his own, and therefore he approves all the reason, and laughs at all the wit of the lady; so that putting her in love with herself, she becomes in love with him. A man of sense, expresses it; but if contrary to the lady's sense, she thinks it nonsense, and he becomes the Teague O'Regan in her judgment. Again, a Teague O'Regan is repressed by no sense of honour, or regard to a permanent happiness, from passing himself for what he is not, and practising imposition, he imposes; talking of his great relations when he has none, and of an estate when the right owner, as the Irish phrase is, keeps him out of it, and provided he can obtain the lady, he never thinks of the catastrophe when the deception is discovered. A Teague O'Regan is less opposed by his rivals; because no one supposes that he can prevail. He is assisted by the female acquaintance of the lady, because they wish her mortified by making a bad choice. In affairs of love there is no lady has a friend except a father, an uncle, or a brother; not always a mother, seldom a sister, but never any one else. Because the pride of a mother may be hurt by the defect of attention to herself; the jealousy of a sister is roused, even tho' provided for, lest it should appear she had not married equally well; and therefore the greater the fool, the more friends he has with all the world, in his advances. But setting all these principles aside, a particular circumstance, as in the late case of the bog-trotter may operate for the season, and make it an object to be addressed by him. I shall conclude these strictures, by laying down some rules, for a prudent father, or guardian to correct the imagination of a young lady, who appears to be facinated with a bog-trotter; and in doing this, I conceive I shall render essential service to humanity. It is a painful thing, having accumulated property, for the sake of a child; and having taken pains to improve and polish, to have her thrown away upon a beast; for according to the expression of the poet, some men are beasts, compared with others. Man differs more from man, Than man from beast. Wilmot. As love then is the offspring of the imagination, reason has nothing to do with it. Ridicule is the only remedy. Never let the Teague O'Regan be opposed, or excluded from the house; but invited, and laughed at; in the mean time giving the young lady no reason to suppose that it is suspected she could possibly have any fancy for such a person. The father or guardian may engage some persons of both sexes, in confidence, to join in the ridicule, and relate or invent incidents of his absurdities; for as the bog-trotter is making an attack upon the honour and happiness of the family, it is self-defence, and justifiable to counteract him by stratagem, when open force will not avail. No object that is made ridiculous can appear amiable; and as to what is respectable, we depend much more upon the opinion of others, than our own. If a lover is opposed, the lady attributes it to an old musty taste in the father, or to envy and jealousy in others, and out of pride she will support him; whereas if he is ridiculed, she becomes ashamed of him, and gives him up. I have thought it worth while to give this hint; because the greater part of our romances and comedies in the English language are calculated to depreciate the respect which a young lady ought to have for the opinion of aged and grave persons; and to confirm her in taking the Teague O'Regan of her own choice. For all such are usually represented as old humdrum curmudgeons, or grany's whose judgment is not worth regarding, and whose taste, in affairs of love, as in their dress, is antiquated, unfashionable, and absurd; but the adventurers, and fortune hunters, are all possessed of taste, and spirit, and gallantry, and carry off the damsel and make her happy. They stop just at the marriage, and give no view of the disgust, repentance, and unhappiness that ensues.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">BOOK IV. CHAP. I. Taking advantage of the humiliated state of mind in which the bog-trotter now was, from the late cowskining, he had received, the Captain thought he could be drawn off from an extreme attention to the ladies, and engaged to apply to the qualifying himself for state affairs. Accordingly continuing his address to him, he observed, that though gallantry and waiting upon ladies, was very agreeable, yet prudence ought to be observed not to create enemies, by seeming to engross their attachment, so as to put a man in danger of duels, and cowskinings: at the same time it behooved a man not to suffer his gallantry to interfere with business; and more especially in the early stages when he was about qualifying himself for any occupation, or appointment; that, as he (Teague O'Regan) was a candidate for state affairs, he ought to check his career, and withdraw himself for some time from the gay circles, in order to acquire some small things which were necessary to the creditable and convenient discharge of a public function; such as learning to write his name if possible. As to learning to read, or write generally that would be a thing of years, if at all acquirable at his period of life; but he might be taught to imitate the few characters that composed his name, in such a manner as to pass for it; so that when he had to sign dispatches or commissions, or the like, he need not be under the necessity of making his mark, like an Indian at a treaty; but might do something that would pass for a signature in letters of the alphabet. So providing him with a room, and placing a table before him with an inkstand, and strewing some papers, and furnishing him with spectacles, as if he was already making out dispatches, he began to instruct him in making the letters, T, E, A, G, U, E, &amp;c. But he had scarcely begun, when the waiter coming in, delivered a parcel of cards, and billets for Major O'Regan. The Captain instantly reflecting that this correspondence with the gay world would undo all that he was doing, and draw off the bog-trotter from his lessons, as soon as the smart of the cowskining had worn off, saw it necessary to read the billets as from different persons, and containing language different from what was in them. The cards being chiefly from men in public employment, he read as they really were. Opening one of the largest of the billets, aye, said he, there is more of it. Do you know this Johnston that seems so much enraged about Miss Muslin to whom you have paid some attention? by the bye, it was a billet from Miss Muslin, to whose acquaintance it would seem he had been introduced; but the Captain read Johnston. By de holy fathers, said Teague, I know no Johnston. He sends you a challenge, said the Captain, to meet him on the commons this evening at six o'clock, with a brace of pistols and a second to determine whether you or he has the best right to pay attention to this lady. We shall give the billet as written by the lady, and as read by the Captain. As written by the Lady. Would wish to have the pleasure of Major O'Regan's company this evening at tea. Lawyer Crabtree and Doctor Drug will be here; and you know we shall split our sides laughing at the ninnies. You're so full of your jokes that I want you here. Dear Major, don't be engaged; but come. Yours sincerely, Patty Muslin. Wedne?day Morning. As read by the Captain. SIR, You will instantly do one of two things, either relinquish your attention to Miss Muslin, and be no more in her company; or meet me this evening precisely at six o'clock, on the commons the back of the Potter's-field, with a brace of pistols, and a second, to take a shot. I shall have a coffin ready, and a grave dug, for which ever of us shall have occasion to make use of it. Your humble servant, Benjamin Johnston. Major Teague O'Regan. In the same manner, he read the other billets, converting them from love letters into challenges to fight with mortal weapons, or into declarations of cudgeling, and cowskining if he interfered any farther in his attentions to such and such ladies. The bog-trotter began to think the devil was broke loose upon him, and very readily gave the Captain leave to write answers, declining all combats, and declaring his compliance with all that was requested of him. The waiter was the only person who by receiving the billets, and handing them in the absence of the Captain, and reading them to Teague, might inflame his mind with the thoughts of the fine ladies, and gay circles, from which he seemed to be just recovered: taking him aside, therefore, and accosting him, Mathew, said he, for that was the name of the waiter, I do not know that I ought to find any fault with your giving your service for some time past, to my Teague, in reading the billets directed to him, and in writing his answers; but I desire that there may be nothing more of this. As he is about to be closely engaged for some time to come, in acquiring some scholarship, and preparing to enter on some state appointment, I do not chuse that his mind should be taken off by affairs of compliment or love. All billets therefore directed to him, you will for the future hand to me. The waiter promised compliance, and said it was all the same thing to him, as all he had done, was to oblige the bog-trotter, and if it was disagreeable to him (the Captain) he should do no more of it. However, Teague continuing still to have some hankering after the company of the ladies, so as not to have his mind so much upon learning to write the characters of his name as the Captain could have wished, he found it necessary to engage the bar-keeper to assist him in personating now and then, some one who had come to demand satisfaction for the interference of the bog-trotter in affairs of love, that by keeping up the alarm on his mind, he might the better confine him to his studies. According to the plan agreed upon the bar-keeper knocking at the door, and the Captain opening it a little, and demanding his business; is there not a Major O'Regan here, he would say (with a counterfeited voice) who has pretensions to Miss Nubbin? (one of those who had sent billets) I wish to see the gentleman, and try if I can put this sword in his body; (by the bye he had a long sword) God love your shoul, would O'Regan say, dear Captain, don't let him in. I shall die wid fear upon de spot here; for I never fought a man in cold blood in my life. Here the bar-keeper as recognizing the voice of O'Regan; yes, would he say, I find he is here, let me in, that I may put this through him; I had paid my addresses to Miss Nubbin, and was just about to espouse her, when, unlike a gentleman, he has interferred, and turned her head with his attention. By the New Jerusalem I shall be through his wind pipe in a second. Teague hearing this and raising the Irish howl, would redouble his entreaties to the Captain not to let him in. The Captain would say, Sir, if you mean to make a pass at him, you must make it through me; for I shall not stand to see a domestic run through the body, and his guts out, while mine are in. You may therefore desist, or I shall have you taken into custody, as a breaker of the peace, With this he would shut the door, and the bar-keeper would go off cursing and swearing that he would have revenge for the insult that had been offered him, by the Irishman. By these artifices, certainly innocent as the object was good; for it can be no injury to deceive a man to his own advantage; by these artifices, the Captain succeeded, in preventing a correspondence with the gay world, and detaching the mind of his pupil, from the gallantries of love. But when any member of Congress or officer of state called upon him, he was admitted. Traddle called frequently, and declared that he had no resentment on account of Teague's proposing to be his competitor, at the election in the country; but wished him success in obtaining some appointment where his talents might be useful.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">As written by the Lady. Would wish to have the pleasure of Major O'Regan's company this evening at tea. Lawyer Crabtree and Doctor Drug will be here; and you know we shall split our sides laughing at the ninnies. You're so full of your jokes that I want you here. Dear Major, don't be engaged; but come. Yours sincerely, Patty Muslin. Wedne?day Morning.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">As read by the Captain. SIR, You will instantly do one of two things, either relinquish your attention to Miss Muslin, and be no more in her company; or meet me this evening precisely at six o'clock, on the commons the back of the Potter's-field, with a brace of pistols, and a second, to take a shot. I shall have a coffin ready, and a grave dug, for which ever of us shall have occasion to make use of it. Your humble servant, Benjamin Johnston. Major Teague O'Regan.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">APPENDIX. Containing Thoughts on some preceding Subjects. In looking over this volume, it strikes me that by introducing Teague to the levee, I may be thought to mean a burlesque on the President. It is not so; I meant a burlesque on Teague. As to levee-holding, I do not know whether it is right or wrong; nor do I care. Because, be it as it may, I believe it can do little harm, and is one of those insipidities in the affairs of men which are of no account. Universal prudence is a characteristic of the President, with a capacity of attending to substantial business, and being able at the same time to accommodate himself to forms and ceremonies. As all mankind are not philosophers, perhaps it is well to possess this talent, in order to please them: As to what I have said on the subject of certificates, it may be asked what the induction of shewing that by the municipal law the transfer might be set aside in equity? Just this; that if a court of equity could act with such latitude, the people themselves, in a national capacity, might with as much. I never had an idea that after these securities, became the subject of traffic, and had acquired a fixed value, for this was nearly the case through all the states, that any means would have been adopted to disturb them. If any means had been adopted, I had expected that at least a scale would have been formed to ascertain their value; as in the case of the continental money; and I would have wanted nothing more than the letter of John Adams to the Count de Vergennes, in the case of the continental money, to justify the like step in the case of the certificates. At any rate the transferees would have been contented, nay, thought themselves very happy with a French crown in the pound, certain payment, or with less; and if it should be said that the original holders had no claim, having parted with their right, let the mass of the people be the gainers, in which case the originalholders would gain something, not having so much of the very debt to discharge which was originally due to themselves. But at the same time that I arraign the policy of the system, I do not call in question the integrity or patriotism of the authors of it. I consider it as an error in judgment, and as I have already hinted, flowing from the excess of integrity itself: doing too much, from a fear of falling short of doing enough. But as the system now exists, it must be supported; all retreat is impracticable, and we must advance. As to peace with the Indians; in order to effect it, my first step would be, to establish a post at Presqu'isle; build and equip vessels on the lake; transport troops, and establish a second post at the rapids of the Miami river: from this last post, make an advance to the Miami towns. It will doubtless be necessary to fight the Indians once; but only once, if beaten; for seeing themselves thus cut off from the British, their resolution will as certainly die, as a plant cut from the root, and left to wither in the mid-day sun. A step of this nature will convince the British that we mean to hold the western country, and will hold it; and losing the hope which they entertain of possessing it themselves, they will be checked in their instigation of the savages against us. It is a strange thing that ideas of treating under present circumstances, cannot possibly be eradicated from the minds of the public. I have conversed abundantly with men who know the Indians, and have been much amongst them since the conclusion of the war with the British. I do not draw my inferences as men in government do, from persons interested in having treaties brought about: I have conversed with traders that have been in the woods, and not at the seat of government, that have as much sense, and more truth, than Indian negociators who, unless treaties are set on foot, are of no use. What has been the result of my information? I will give the very language of the Indians. “You are learned, (speaking of us) you think yourselves wise; and can get our land by giving your goods. Our chiess are not learned, but are more wise; for they can take your goods, and keep our land too.” They are positively astonished at our simplicity; for they have no idea of faith and honour in the case. The greater fraud, the more honour, if it can be committed with impunity. They must be made to dread us: that is the truth of it. Is this practicable? Easily. Discard treaties; increase, or at least fill up, the establishment of troops, under the command of General Wayne. Let him have an opportunity of giving them at least one blow. This will do more good than a thousand fires kindled, and ten thousand bales of goods given. We are now in a fair way to be able to beat them. Our troops, not the best materials it is true, the best men not always enlisting as soldiers, at the low pay stipulated; but from the great exertions of the Commander in Chief, in the course of the last summer, and the present winter, they are certainly in a good state of discipline. It would be a pity that all this expence in raising troops, and exertions in training them, should evaporate in the smoke of a treaty.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CONCLUSION OF THE THIRD VOLUME. Looking over the preceding sheets, and observing several errors of the press, I had thoughts of giving a table of them. But I recollect that in other books, a table of this kind has appeared to me unnecessary.— Because the intelligent reader could in general himself see what were errors, and as to the unintelligent, it made no great odds, whether he did or not. But in justice to the printer, it may be necessary to advertise the reader, that I have been the corrector of the press myself, and therefore with respect to these errors he is not in fault. The truth is, though I am an excellent writer, I mean as to authorship, yet I am, perhaps the worst corrector of a press in the world. I have not patience in what is in the least degree mechan nical. It is impossible for me to examine literatim and verbatim; not even indeed lineatim and paginatim. I cast a quick glance upon the sheet, and unless something very glaring strikes my eye, I let it pass. As to the fate of the bog-trotter, I must leave the matter in suspence until the fourth volume, when I shall dispose of him to as much advantage as possible. I have only farther to say at present, that I wish I could get this work to make a little more noise. Will no body attack it, and prove that it is insipid, libellous, treasonable, immoral, or irreligious? If they will not do this, let them do something else, praise it, call it excellent, say it contains wit, erudition, genius, and the Lord knows what? Will no body speak? What? Ho! are ye all asleep in the hold there down at Philadelphia? Will none of you abuse, praise, reprobate, or commend this performance? It is ill usage; that is all I can say; and I will take my revenge in a short time unless the matter mends, by dropping my pen altogether, as I now do for the present.</field>
