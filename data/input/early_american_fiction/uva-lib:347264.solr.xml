      <field name="fulltext">ANTE-PREFACE. 526EAF. Ante-Preface, with a head-piece depicting two men and two women, in medieval dress, holding hands and walking through a corn field. D'israeli, the elder, in his Chapter on Prefaces, says that “the way to entertain the reader and “soothe him into good humor, will be best obtained “by making the preface (like a symphony to an “opera) to contain something analogous to the work “itself, to attune the mind into a harmony of tone.” The writer of the preface to a former edition of this work had endeavored to follow the advice of this elegant writer, but, alas! Old Dizzy has no advice to give as to ante-prefaces; so, not having the fear of precedents before his eyes, the editor can be as dull as he pleases. If the reader is offended, all that he has to do is to turn over a few pages, and get into the very marrow of the book itself, and when he has exhausted that, turn back to preface and ante-preface if he chooses, in hopes to extract some benefit from them, just as children, when they have extracted the juice out of a ripe orange, fall to and chew the skin with unsatisfied desire. For my part I do not see what right a preface has in the beginning of a book at all. I am not averse to innovation myself, but I do not like to be the pioneer in this kind of business; and if I could change matters, I would soon alter the title of all “prefaces” to “appenda,” and hang them on the tail of each work, like bobs on a kite. In furnishing the preface to “Father Tom and the Pope,” the writer had adopted the common belief among literary men here, that William Maginn was the author. It is very true that in Dr. Mackenzie's excellent edition of this author's collected works, “Father Tom” does not appear. But that goes for very little. I have also the collected works of Jonathan Swift, D.D., published by Charles Bathurst, London, 1742, in twelve volumes, 12mo., in which Gulliver's Travels do not appear! And in the collected works of the true author of “Father Tom and the Pope,” this admirable sketch is carefully omitted. In a letter to me he says: “My friend “Dr. Smith has informed you correctly as to the “authorship of `Father Tom and the Pope.' It was “written by me in the summer of 1838, just about “the time of my call to the Irish Bar. No one “else had any hand in it, and like the `Forging of “ `the Anchor,' it underwent a rejection before its “appearance in Blackwood. I am flattered by its “having been ascribed to Maginn, for whose genius “I entertain a high admiration. I have never “made any secret of the authorship, but as I have “constantly endeavored in any literary work I have “been able to do for many years back to elevate the “Irish subject out of the burlesque, I have an indis “position to place my name on the title-page of so “very rollicking a piece as Father Tom.” In another part of the letter he says, “Anything that I “have done in the higher walk of my literary vo “cation has become very slowly known, owing “probably to a not unnatural repugnance toward “the Irish subject, when presented in any other “than a droll aspect.” It is scarcely courteous for me to take such a liberty as to place the name of the author upon the title-page of this book, but I have no reason to withhold the information which I derived from other sources as to its paternity. A dear friend, whose memory is familiar to every lover of literature in this country,* * Hon. Gulian C. Verplanck. soon after the first edition of this book appeared, told me that I was all wrong in my surmises; that Thackeray, when he was here, had said that “Father Tom and the Pope” was written by a gentleman from Wexford, Ireland, (the author is really a native of Belfast,) who, like Single-Speech Hamilton, had never distinguished himself in any other way; and who, although a writer of very great genius, seemed content to rest his fame upon this first-born child of his brain. Soon after I received a letter from one of the most learned fathers of the Roman Catholic Church, who corrects me in some particulars in the preface. He says, “You say Maginn was a good “Catholic. He never was a Catholic. He was a “Protestant of the Church of England, `so-called,' “and so was his father before him. Maginn was a “man of extraordinary genius. But like many “others of that ilk, he was unfortunate. His bro “ther, Rev. Charles Maginn, is I believe living still, “and a clergyman of the Church of England, `so“called.' With regard to the discussion between “Father Tom and Rev. Mr. Pope, you seem very “injudiciously to have prejudged the case. In so “ber truth, Father Tom overcame Pope. This was “confessed by many Protestant clergymen of the “Church of England, `so-called;' among the many, “two well known to myself, Rev. Stephen Ratcliff, “of Lisnadell, and Rev. Mr. Olpherts, of Armagh. “You say that Father Tom by some legerdemain “drove Pope to the Fathers, and that Pope having “thus been driven from the dear Bible and unac “quainted with the Fathers, was used up by Fa “ther Tom, etc. Now this is not so; neither is it “at all true that Pope, having commenced to study “the Fathers, found Father Tom's quotations false, “etc. Now, my dear friend, please call on Donegan “&amp; Brother's publishing house, N. Y., where you “can get the controversy of `Pope and Maguire,' and “you will find that the Provost of Trinity College, “Dublin, refused to translate the extract from a “Greek Father, and it remains untranslated in the “published controversy. Maguire was willing to “leave the translation to the Provost when his own “had been disputed. But the Provost would not, “so that there is no use talking about the Fathers “in that way. “I will give you an opinion from St. Augustine, “one of the most philosophical and logical men that “ever existed. `I would not believe the Scriptures “were it not for the testimony of the Church.' Now “what do you say to that? St. Augustine is right. “How would we know it to be Scripture were it not “for the testimony of the Church? My dear sir, I “need not pursue the argument any further, for to “one of your natural and acquired ability it must be “self-evident. Father Maguire boldly asserted in “a speech in public in the city of Dublin, that he “had been offered a `nate' church, with a living “worth £800 per annum. The Protestants called on “him for the proof. Father Tom offered to give the “proof in presence of men he named at any day and “date they pleased. It is needless to say that the “men he named were Protestants, but high-minded “gents, and he was never troubled more about it. “With respect to Heffernan, whom you call a hedge “priest, he is represented as a hedge-schoolmaster; “as you will see through all the narrative of `Fa “`ther Tom and the Pope.' “Again, I do not believe that Maginn was the “author. I think, if I rightly recollect, it appeared “in the `Dublin University Magazine,' author un “known.” Nearly at the same time that this letter from my amiable Roman Catholic friend was received, another one had reached me, written by a personal friend of the author of “Father Tom and the Pope.” As liberty has been given me to make use of it, I quote a brief extract. “I regretted to see,” says “the writer, (David S.

      <field name="fulltext">1 PREFACE. 526EAF. Preface. Head-piece consisting of a diptych; the left side shows monks and knights gathered around the bed of an ill man who holds a large crucifix. The right side shows a church scholar reading a book that is on a book-stand. He is also holding a rolled-up parchment. THERE are several questions which at this present time remainn unsettled. One of them is, “who invented gunpowder?” Another is, “which of them was it, Faust or Guttemberg, that invented print ing?” Another is, “whether the Deity created nature, or nature created itself?” That is a poser. Another is, “whether the original egg was the parent of the chicken, or the egg was the original ancestor of that celebrated feathered fowl?” “De novum ovum,” says Xinctillios, “inseperatum primero, cum possibilitas et credentia, in meo judicio, quam supra calcis phosphas, qui est, in the bones of the chicken.” In other words, and to make it plain to the reader, he, Xinctillios, cannot understand how it is possible for human comprehension to see a new laid egg, without permitting in his judgment the idea of phosphate of lime existing in the osseous structure of the bones of the original hen. St. Bardolphus entertains a contrary opinion, “Anam, aname, mona mike,” says he, “Barcelona bona strike,” says he, “harum scarum, wy frone whack!” (I give you the original Coptic) “harrico barrico, we won frac!” Between these two contending opinions I have nothing to say. The dogmas of the Roman Catholic Church, and the folatreries of the philosophers of the high school of nature, differ so widely, that it is impossible for common sense to adopt either the one or the other—and the Greek Church on these points has given no decided opinion! Such a dilemma presents itself when we come to consider the contents of this volume. Who wrote it? Some say, Lord Brougham; and some attribute it to the Duke of Wellington, who understood the Irish vernacular to a dot. I have a shrewd suspicion that Maginn, a high tory, although a good Roman Catholic, and one of the prominent contributors to Blackwood, lent his helping hand to it, if he were not the real author of it all. “Howandiver,” to use a phrase of the author, let us look into the history of it. Father Tom Maguire, a prominent Roman Catholic priest in Killeshandra, Ireland, of the parish of Innismagrath, was one of the most celebrated men of his time. He was a splendid orator, trained at Maynooth; he was a high liver—everything consisting of meat and drink on his table was of the best; his wines were excellent; and he kept the best stable and the finest greyhounds in Ireland. He was a bold fox-hunter; rode over ditch, hedge and five-barred gate; and when his good Bishop interdicted these sports of the Irish clergy, says he, “I will give up my hunting,” says he; “but if I must give up my greyhounds, there is a little Protestant parish church hard by waiting for me.” Whether this threat had the desired effect is not known. It is said that he adjured his church and died a heretic. How much of this we can believe depends altogether upon the amount of our credulity. It may be true, and, alas! it may not! Father Tom, as the great Roman Catholic controversalist, was challenged to decide by argument the superiority of the Romish Church over that of the Established Church of England, by the Rev. Richard T. P. Pope, a clergyman of the latter persuasion. The controversy took place in the Rotunda, at Dublin, about forty years ago.* * In 1827. Crowds of spectators assembled to witness the religious contest. Of course the ladies, who always take a great interest in religious disputations, were present in great numbers. The beauty and the fashion, the graceful, the wise and the witty of Dublin assembled to hear these knotty points discussed. The Rev. Mr. Pope, who was a very learned scholar, but unfortunately a timid man, based his great argument upon the Bible itself. So long as he stood upon this ground his arguments were unassailable. But Father Tom, by one of those dexterous twists so well known in polemics, managed to get Pope to shift his ground from the Bible to the Fathers. The dispute, which had occupied several days, up to this time had been in favor of Pope, but when Father Maguire got him entangled in the Fathers, and hurled at him quotation after quotation from St. Austin, St. Chrysostom, and others—poor Pope, who knew very little of the Fathers, became so dumb-foundered that he was incapable of making a reply, and the victory rested with Father Tom. But after the controversy was over the Rev. Mr. Pope took up the Fathers, and to his surprise could not find any of the quotations that Father Tom had cited! Like a true scholar, he published a book, exposing the fallacies of his antagonist. But the time had gone by. Few people cared to read it, fewer still had patience to wade through laborious denials of the smart sayings of Father Tom in the Rotunda; the sparkle was off— the champagne had ceased to effervesce—and Mr. Pope never recovered the ground he had lost. Some years elapsed, and the Rev. Tresham D. Gregg, of the Established Church, took up the polemical cudgels to demolish the redoubtable champion of the Romish Church. He was just such a man as his antagonist, vehement, loud-voiced —of the ad captandum, knock-down-and-drag-out school. Although not acknowledged by the Church of England as the Goliath of its faith, yet there is no doubt of the secret exultation of its clergy at his success. The challenge was accepted, and for a fortnight the Rotunda of Dublin rang with the verbal blows of these doughty combatants. Victory poised her scales; the contest hung in the balance. At last, one afternoon, after the battle of the day was over, Gregg raised his mighty arm high in the air, and said “that on the next day, the secrets of the confessional would be the subject of the discourse,” and warned the ladies, “that no modest woman would appear, or could appear, while he revealed the secrets of that powerful instrument of the Romish Church.” The consequences may be imagined. The hall was packed to overflowing by the gentler sex. Ladies of the Catholic persuasion, conscious of the inability of the orator to make his words good, flocked to hear his discomfiture. Those of the other persuasion were induced to come from a laudable curiosity. The argument, if argument it might be called, consisted on Gregg's part of that style which Poe has properly denominated “the awkward left arm of satire—invective.” He had caught Father Tom at single-stick and paid him off in his own way. There was of course no little allusion to indelicate matters. After the argument the Rev. Mr. Gregg had to be escorted to his lodgings by a troop of dragoons. At the close of the debate he announced, that on the morrow the subject would be continued; but on the following day Father Tom did not appear. The victorious Gregg was cock of the walk; the judgment went by default. Whether any one among the speakers or listeners became better Christians after the controversy, is a question. It is doubtful whether Gregg or Father Tom made or lost a single convert to either faith. “Father Tom and the Pope” first saw the light in Blackwood, ten years after these controversies. It may have been written by Maginn, who was a good Catholic, but it may truly be said of him, that although he “loved the Church much, he loved fun more.” As a work of mere wit it must take its place with some of the brightest efforts of Rabelais, of Montaigue, or of Pascal. The ingenuity with which the conversation between the Pope and Father Tom is developed to the reader, forms no little part of its felicitousness. A hedge priest, one Michael Heffernan, of the National School of Ballymacktaggart, is the interlocutor. This keeper of a ragged school, under the shadow of an Irish hedge, is the exponent of theological controversies that have shaken the world! Happy satire! which like summer lightning, clears up the atmosphere, and makes even the skies bright, blue, beautiful and buoyant. To us! poor mortals! to whom a touch of nature shakes the laughter out of us, or brings the tears into our eyes, such books are the treasures of our language. If out of the sorrow and misery of this world, wit has managed to alleviate one shade of human suffering; if it has lifted up its hand against 526EAF. Preface. Page 013.

There are groups of hunting dogs gathered around the cornered stag, with the lead hunter pressing his sword to its neck. There are other hunters gathered in the periphery. WHEN his Riv'rence was in Room, ov coorse the Pope axed him to take pot-look wid him. More be token, it was on a Friday; but, for all that, there was plenty of mate; for the Pope gev himself an absolution from the fast on account ov the great company that was in it—at laste so I'm tould. Howandiver, there's no fast on the dhrink, anyhow —glory be to God!—and so, as they wor sitting, afther dinner, taking their sup together, says the Pope, says he, “Thomaus”—for the Pope, you know, spakes that way, all as one as one ov uz— “Thomaus a lanna,” says he, “I'm tould you welt them English heretics out ov the face.” “You may say that,” says his Riv'rence to him again. “Be my sowl,” says he, “if I put your Holiness undher the table, you won't be the first Pope I floored.” Well, his Holiness laughed like to split; for, you know, Pope was the great Prodesan that Father Tom put down upon Purgathory; and ov coorse they knewn all the ins and outs of the conthravarsy at Room. “Faix, Thomaus,” says he, smiling across the table at him mighty agreeable—“it's no lie what they tell me, that yourself is the pleasant man over the dhrop ov good liquor.” “Would you like to thry?” says his Riv'rence. “Sure, and amn't I thrying all I can?” says the Pope. “Sorra betther bottle ov wine's betuxt this and Salamancha, nor's there fornenst you on the table; its raal Lachrymalchrystal, every spudh of it.” “It's mortial could,” says Father Tom. “Well, man alive,” says the Pope, “sure and here's the best of good claret in the cut decanther.” “Not maning to make little ov the claret, your Holiness,” says his Riv'rence, “I would prefir some hot wather and sugar, wid a glass of spirits through it, if convanient.” “Hand me over the bottle ov brandy,” says the Pope to his head butler, “and fetch up the materi'ls,” says he. “Ah, then, your Holiness,” says his Riv'rence mighty eager, “maybe you'd have a dhrop ov the native in your cellar? Sure it's all one throuble,” says he, “and, throth, I dunna how it is, but brandy always plays the puck wid my inthrails.” “'Pon my conscience, then,” says the Pope, “it's very sorry I am, Misther Maguire,” says he, “that it isn't in my power to plase you; for I'm sure and certaint that there's not as much whiskey in Room this blessed minit as 'ud blind the eye ov a midge.” “Well, in troth, your Holiness,” says Father Tom, “I knewn there was no use in axing; only,” says he, “I didn't know how else to exqueeze the liberty I tuck,” says he, “ov bringing a small taste,” says he, “ov the raal stuff,” says he, hauling out an imperi'l quart bottle out of his coat-pocket, “that never seen the face ov a gauger,” says he, setting it down on the table fornenst the Pope: “and if you'll jist thry the full ov a thimble ov it, and it doesn't rise the cockles ov your Holiness's heart, why, then, my name,” says he, “isn't Tom Maguire!” and wid that he outs wid the cork. Well, the Pope at first was going to get vexed at Father Tom for fetching dhrink thataway in his pocket, as if there wasn't lashins in the house: so says he, “Misther Maguire,” says he, “I'd have you to comprehind the differ betuxt an invitation to dinner from the succissor of Saint Pether, and from a common mayur or a Prodesan squireen that may be hasn't liquor enough in his cupboard to wet more nor his own heretical whistle. That may be the way wid them that you visit in Leithrim,” says he, “and in Roscommon; and I'd let you know the differ in the prisint case,” says he, “only that you're a champion of the Church and entitled to laniency. So,” says he, “as the liquor's come, let it stay. And in troth I'm curis myself,” says he, getting mighty soft when he found the delightful smell ov the putteen, “in invistigating the composition ov distilled liquors; it's a branch of natural philosophy,” says he, taking up the bottle and putting it to his blessed nose. Ah! my dear, the very first snuff he got ov it, he cried out, the dear man: “Blessed Vargin, but it has the divine smell!” and crossed himself and the bottle half-a-dozen times running. “Well, sure enough, it's the blessed liquor now,” says his Riv'rence, “and so there can be no harm any way in mixing a dandy of punch; and,” says he, stirring up the materi'ls with his goolden muddler—for everything at the Pope's table, to the very schrew for drawing the corks, was ov vergin goold—“if I might make bould,” says he, “to spake on so deep a subjic afore your Holiness, I think it 'ud considherably facilitate the invistigation ov its chemisthry and phwarmaceutics, if you'd jist thry the laste sup in life ov it inwardly.” “Well, then, suppose I do make the same expiriment,” says the Pope, in a much more condescinding way nor you'd have expected—and wid that he mixes himself a real stiff facer. “Now, your Holiness,” says Father Tom, “this bein' the first time you ever dispinsed them chymicals,” says he, “I'll just make bould to lay down one rule of orthography,” says he, “for conwhounding them, secundum mortem.” “What's that?” says the Pope. “Put in the sperits first,” says his Riv'rence; “and then put in the sugar; and remember, every dhrop ov wather you put in after that spoils the punch.” “Glory be to God!” says the Pope, not minding a word Father Tom was saying. “Glory be to God!” says he, smacking his lips. “I never knewn what dhrink was afore,” says he. “It bates the Lachrymalchrystal out ov the face!” says he—“it's Necthar itself, it is, so it is!” says he, wiping his epistolical mouth wid the cuff ov his coat. “'Pon my secret honor,” says his Riv'rence, “I'm raally glad to see your Holiness set so much to your satisfaction; especially,” says he, “as, for fear ov accidents, I tuck the liberty of fetching the fellow ov that small vesshel,” says he, “in my other coat pocket. So divil a fear ov our running dhry till the but-end of the evening, anyhow,” says he. “Dhraw your stool in to the fire, Misther Maguire,” says the Pope, “for faix,” says he, “I'm bent on analyzing the metaphwysics ov this phinomenon. Come, man alive, clear off,” says he, “you're not dhrinking at all.” “Is it dhrink?” says his Riv'rence; “by Gorra, your Holiness,” says he, “I'd dhrink wid you till the cows'ud be coming home in the morning.” So wid that they tackled to, to the second fugee a piece, and fell into larned discourse.

Howandiver, wishing I was like them, in regard ov the sup of dhrink, anyhow, I must brake off my norration for the prisint; but when I see you again, I'll tell you how Father Tom made a hare ov the Pope that evening, both in theology and the cube root.</field>

Head-piece depicting two men and two women, in medieval dress, holding hands and walking through a corn field. WELL, the lecthir's over, and I'm kilt out and out. My bitther curse upon the man that invinted the same Boord! I thought ons't I'd fadomed the say ov throuble; and that was when I got through fractions at ould Mat Kavanagh's school, in Firdra-more—God be good to poor Mat's sowl, though he did deny the cause the day he suffered! but it's fluxions itself we're set to bottom now, sink or shwim! May I never die if my head isn't as throughother as anything wid their ordinals and cardinals—and, begob, it's all nothing to the econimy lecthir that I have got to go to at two o'clock. Howandiver, I mustn't forget that we left his Riv'rence and his Holiness sitting fornenst one another in the parlor ov the Vatican, jist afther mixing their second tumbler. When they had got well down into the same, they fell, as I was telling you, into larned discourse. For, you see, the Pope was curious to find out whether Father Tom was the great theologinall that people said; and says he, “Misther Maguire,” says he, “what answer do you make to the heretics when they quote them passidges agin thransubstantiation out ov the Fathers?” says he. “Why,” says his Riv'rence, “as there should be no sich passidges I make myself mighty aisy about them; but if you want to know how I dispose ov them,” says he, “just repate one ov them,” says he, “and I'll show you how to catapomphericate it in two shakes.” “Why, then,” says the Pope, “myself disremimbers the particlar passidges they allege out ov them old felleys,” says he, “though sure enough they're more numerous nor edifying; so we'll jist suppose that a heretic was to find sich a saying as this in Austin, `Every sinsible man knows that thransubstantiation is a lie,' or this out of Tartullian or Plutarch, `the Bishop ov Room is a common imposther,' now tell me, could you answer him?” “As easy as kiss,” says his Riv'rence. “In the first, we're to understand that the exprission, `Every sinsible man,' signifies simply, `Every man that judges by his nath'ral sinses;' and we all know that nobody folleying them seven deludhers could ever find out the mysthery that's in it, if somebody didn't come in to his assistance wid an eighth sinse, which is the only sinse to be depended on, being the sinse ov the Church. So that, regarding the first quotation which your Holiness has supposed, it makes clane for us, and tee-totally agin the heretics.” “That's the explanation sure enough,” says his Holiness; “and now what div you say to my being a common imposther?” “Faix, I think,” says his Riv'rence, “wid all submission to the betther judgment ov the learned father that your Holiness has quoted, he'd have been a thrifle nearer the truth, if he had said that the Bishop ov Room is the grand imposther and top-sawyer in that line over us all.” “What do you mane?” says the Pope, getting quite red in the face. “What would I mane,” says his Riv'rence, as composed as a docther of physic, “but that your Holiness is at the head ov all them—troth I had a'most forgot I wasn't a bishop myself,” says he, (the deludher was going to say, at the head ov all us,)—“that has the gift ov laying on hands. For sure,” says he, “imposther and imposithir is all one, so you're only to undherstand manuum, and the job is done. Awouich!” says he, “if any heretic'ud go for to cast up sich a passidge as that agin me, I'd soon give him a lesson in the p'lite art ov cutting a stick to welt his own back wid.” “Pon my epostolical word,” says the Pope, you've cleared up them two pints in a most satisfacthery manner.” “You see,” says his Riv'rence—by this time they wor mixing their third tumbler—“the writings ov them Fathers is to be thrated wid great veneration; and it 'ud be the height of presumption in any one to sit down to interpret them widout providing himself wid a genteel assortment ov the best figures ov rhetoric, sich as mettonymy, hyperbol, cattychraysis, prolipsis, mettylipsis, superbaton, pollysyndreton, hustheronprotheron, prosodypeia, and the like, in ordher that he may never be at a loss for shuitable sintiments when he comes to their high-flown passidges. For unless we thrate them Fathers liberally to a handsome allowance ov thropes and figures, they'd set up heresy at ons't, so they would.” “It's thrue for you,” says the Pope; “the figures ov spache is the pillars of the Church.” “Bedad,” says his Riv'rence, “I dunna what we'd do widout them at all.” “Which one do you prefir?” says the Pope; “that is,” says he, “which figure ov spache do you find most usefullest when you're hard set?” “Metaphour's very good,” says his Riv'rence, “and so's mettonymy; and I've known prosodypeia stand to me at a pinch mighty well; but for a constancy, superbaton's the figure for my money. Divil be in me,” says he, “but I'd prove black white as fast as a horse 'ud throt wid only a good stock of superbaton.” “Faix,” says the Pope, wid a sly look, “you'd need to have it backed, I judge, wid a small taste ov assurance.” “Well now, jist for that word,” says his Riv'rence, “I'll prove it widout aither one or other. Black,” says he, “is one thing, and white is another thing. You don't conthravene that? But every thing is aither one thing or another thing; I defy the apostle Paul to get over that dilemma. Well! If any thing be one thing, well and good; but if it be another thing, then it's plain it isn't both things, and so can't be two things—nobody can deny that. But what can't be two things must be one thing— Ergo, whether it's one thing or another thing it's all one. But black is one thing and white is another thing—Ergo, black and white is all one. Quod erat demonsthrandum.” “Stop a bit,” says the Pope, “I can't althegither give in to your second minor—no—your second major,” says he, and he stopped. “Faix, then,” says he, getting confused, “I don't rightly remimber where it was exactly that I thought I seen the flaw in your premises. Howsomdiver,” says he, “I don't deny that it's a good conclusion, and one that 'ud be ov materi'l service to the Church if it was dhrawn wid a little more distinctiveness.” “I'll make it as plain as the nose on your Holiness's face, by superbaton,” says his Riv'rence. “My adversary says, black is not another color, that is, white! Now, that's jist a parallel passidge wid the one out ov Tartullian that me and Hayes smashed the heretics on in Clarendon sthreet, `This is my body—that is, the figure ov my body.' That's a superbaton, and we showed that it oughtn't to be read that way at all, but this way, `This figure ov my body is my body.' Jist so wid my adversary's proposition, it mustn't be undherstood the way it reads, by no manner ov manes; but it's to be taken this way: `Black, that is, white, is not another color;' green, if you like, or orange, by dad, for anything I care, for my case is proved. `Black, that is, white,' lave-out the `that,' by sinnalayphy, and you have the orthodox conclusion, `Black is white,' or by convarsion, `White is black.” “It's as clear as mud,” says the Pope. “Begad,” says his Riv'rence, “I'm in great humor for disputin' to-night. I wisht your Holiness was a heretic jist for two minutes,” says he, “till you'd see the flaking I'd give you!” “Well, then, for the fun o' the thing, suppose me my namesake, if you like,” says the Pope, laughing, “though, by Jayminy,” says he, “he's not one that I take much pride out ov.” “Very good—divil a betther joke ever I had,” says his Riv'rence. “Come, then, Misther Pope,” says he, “hould up that purty face ov yours, and answer me this question. Which 'ud be the biggest lie, if I said I seen a turkey-cock lying on the broad of his back, and picking the stars out ov the sky, or if I was to say that I seen a gandher in the same intherestin' posture, raycreating himself wid similar asthronomical expiriments? Answer me that, you ould swaddler!” says he. “How durst you call me a swaddler, sir?” says the Pope, forgetting, the dear man, the part that he was acting. “Don't think for to bully me!” says his Riv'rence, “I always daar to spake the truth, and it's well known that you're nothing but a swaddling ould sinner of a saint,” says he, never letting on to persave that his Holiness had forgot what they were agreed on. “By all that's good,” says the Pope, “I often hard ov the imperance ov you Irish afore,” says he “but I never expected to be called a saint in my own house either by Irishman or Hottentot. I'll till you what, Misther Maguire,” says he, “if you can't keep a civil tongue in your head, you had betther be walking off wid yourself; for I beg lave to give you to undherstand, that it won't be for the good ov your health if you call me by sich an out-probrious epithet again,” says he. “Oh, indeed! then things is come to a purty pass,” says his Riv'rence (the dear funny soul that he ever was!) “when the likes of you compares one of the Maguires ov Tempo wid a wild Ingine! Why, man alive, the Maguires was kings of Fermanagh three thousand years afore your grandfather, that was the first of your breed that ever wore shoes and stockings,” (I'm bound to say, in justice to the poor Prodesan, that this was all spoken by his Riv'rence by way ov a figure ov spache,) “was sint his Majesty's arrand to cultivate the friendship of Prince Lee Boo in Botteney Bay! Oh Bryan dear,” says he, letting on to cry, “if you were alive to hear a boddagh Sassenagh like this casting up his counthry to one ov the name ov Maguire!” “In the name ov God,” says the Pope, very solemniously, “what is the maning of all this at all at all?” says he. “Sure,” says his Riv'rence, whispering to him across the table, “sure you know we're acting a conthravarsy, and you tuck the part of the Prodesan champion. You wouldn't be angry wid me, I'm sure, for sarving out the heretic to the best ov my ability.” “Oh begad, I had forgot,” says the Pope, the good-natured ould crethur; “sure enough you were only taking your part, as a good Milesian Catholic ought, agin the heretic Sassenagh. Well,” says he, “fire away now, and I'll put up wid as many conthrovarsial compliments as you plase to pay me.” “Well, then, answer me my question, you sanctimonious ould dandy,” says his Riv'rence. “In troth, then,” says the Pope, “I dunna which 'ud be the biggest lie: to my mind,” says he, “the one appears to be about as big a bounce as the other.” “Why, then, you poor simpleton,” says his Riv'rence, “don't you persave that, forbye the advantage the gandher 'ud have in the length ov his neck, it 'ud be next to onpossible for the turkey-cock lying thataway to see what he was about, by rason ov his djollars and other accouthrements hanging back over his eyes? The one about as big a bounce as the other! Oh, you misforthunate crethur! if you had ever larned your A B C in theology, you'd have known that there's a differ betuxt them two lies so great, that, begad, I would'nt wondher if it 'ud make a balance ov five years in purgathory to the sowl that 'ud be in it. Ay, and if it wasn't that the Church is too liberal entirely, so she is, it 'ud cost his heirs and succissors betther nor ten pounds to have him out as soon as the other. Get along, man, and take half a year at dogmatical theology: go and read your Dens, you poor dunce, you!” “Raaly,” says the Pope, “you're making the heretic's shoes too hot to hold me. I wondher how the Prodesans can stand afore you at all.” “Don't think to delude me,” says his Riv'rence, “don't think to back out ov your challenge now,” says he, “but come to the scratch like a man, if you are a man, and answer me my question. What's the rason, now, that Julius Cæsar and the Vargin Mary was born upon the one day?—answer me that, if you wouldn't be hissed off the platform!” Well, my dear, the Pope couldn't answer it, and he had to acknowledge himself sacked. Then he axed his Riv'rence to tell him the rason himself; and Father Tom communicated it to him in Latin. But as that is a very deep question, I never hard what the answer was, except that I'm tould it was so mysterious, it made the Pope's hair stand on end. But there's two o'clock, and I'll be late for the lecthir.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER III. HOW FATHER TOM MADE A HARE OF HIS HOLINESS IN LATIN. 526EAF. [Page 033]. Head-piece that depicts three infants fleeing through undergrowth while being chased by a two-headed beast. OH! Docther Whately, Docther Whately, I'm sure I'll never die another death if I don't die aither of consumption or production! I ever and always thought that asthronomy was the hardest science that was till now—and it's no lie I'm telling you, the same asthronomy is a tough enough morsel to break a man's fast upon—and geolidgy is middling and hard too—and hydherastatics is no joke; but ov all the books ov science that ever was opened and shut, that book upon Pilitical Econimy lifts the pins! Well, well, if they wait till they persuade me that taking a man's rints out ov the counthry, and spinding them in forrain parts, isn't doing us out ov the same, they'll wait a long time in troth. But you're waiting, I see, to hear how his Riv'rence and his Holiness got on after finishing the disputation I was telling you ov. Well, you see, my dear, when the Pope found he couldn't hould a candle to Father Tom in theology and logic, he thought he'd take the shine out ov him in Latin anyhow; so says he, “Misther Maguire,” says he, “I quite agree wid you that it's not lucky for us to be spaking on them deep subjects in sich langidges as the evil spirits is acquainted wid; and,” says he, “I think it 'ud be no harm for us to spake from this out in Latin,” says he, “for fraid the devil 'ud undherstand what we are saying.” “Not a hair I care,” says Father Tom, “whether he undherstands what we're saying or not, so long as we keep off that last pint we wor discussing, and one or two others. List'ners never hard good ov themselves,” says he; “and if Belzhebub takes anything amiss that aither you or me says in regard ov himself or his faction, let him stand forrid like a man, and, never fear, I'll give him his answer. Howandiver, if it's for a taste ov classic conversation you are, just to put us in mind ov ould Cordarius,” says he, “here's at you;” and wid that he lets fly at his Holiness wid his health in Latin. “Vesthræ Sanctitatis salutem volo!” says he. “Vesthræ Revirintiæ salubritati bibo!” says the Pope to him again (faith, it's no joke, I tell you, to remimber sich a power ov larning). “Here's to you wid the same,” says the Pope, in the raal Ciceronian. “Nunc poculum alterhum imple,” says he. “Cum omni jucunditate in vita,” says his Riv'rence. “Cum summâ concupiscintiâ et animositate,” says he; as much as to say: “Wid all the veins ov my heart, I'll do that same;” and so, wid that, they mixed their fourth gun apiece. “Aqua vitæ vesthra sane est liquor admirabilis,” says the Pope. “Verum est pro te—it's thrue for you,” says his Riv'rence, forgetting the idyim ov the Latin phrawseology, in a manner. “Prava est tua Latinitas, domine,” says the Pope, finding fault like wid his etymology. “Parva culpa mihi,” “small blame to me, that is,” says his Riv'rence; “nam multum laboro in partibus interioribus,” says he—the dear man! that never was at a loss for an excuse! “Quid tibi incommodi?” says the Pope, axing him what ailed him. “Habesne id quod Anglice vocamus, a looking-glass,” says his Riv'rence. “Immo, habeo speculum splendidissimum subther operculum pyxidis hujus starnutatoriæ,” says the Pope, pulling out a beautiful goold snuff-box, wid a looking-glass in under the lid; “Subther operculum pyxidis hujus starnutatorii—no—starnutatoriæ—quam dono accepi ab Archi-duce Austhriaco sipthuagisima prætheritâ,” says he; as much as to say that he got the box in a prisint from the Queen of Spain last Lint, if I rightly remimber. Well, Father Tom laughed like to burst. At last, says he, “Pather Sancte,” says he, “sub errore jaces. `Looking-glass' apud nos habet significationem quamdam peculiarem ex tempore diei dependentem” —there was a sthring ov accusatives for yez!— “nam mane speculum sonat,” says he, “post prandium vero mat—mat—mat”—sorra be in me but I disremimber the classic appellivation ov the same article. Howandiver, his Riv'rence went on explaining himself in such a way as no scholar could mistake. “Vesica mea,” says he, “ab illo ultimo eversore distenditur, donec similis est rumpere. 3 Verbis apertis,” says he, “Vesthræ Sanctitatis præsentia salvata, aquam facere valde desidhero.” “Ho, ho, ho!” says the Pope, grabbing up his box; “si inquinavisses meam pyxidem, excommunicari debuisses. Hillo, Anthony,” says he to his head butler, “fetch Misther Maguire a—” “You spoke first!” says his Riv'rence, jumping off his sate: “You spoke first in the vernacular. I take Misther Anthony to witness,” says he. “What else would you have me to do?” says the Pope, quite dogged like to see himself bate that-away at his own waypons. “Sure,” says he, “Anthony wouldn't understand a B from a bull's foot, if I spoke to him any other way.” “Well, then,” says his Riv'rence, “in considheration ov the needcessity,” says he, “I'll let you off for this time; but mind, now, afther I say proestho, the first of us that spakes a word of English is the hare—proestho!” Neither ov them spoke for near a minit, considhering wid themselves how they wor to begin sich a great thrial ov shkill. At last says the Pope—the blessed man! only think how 'cute it was ov him! —“Domine Maguire,” says he, “valde desidhero, certiorem fieri de significatione istius verbi eversor quo jam jam usus es”—(well, surely I am the boy for the Latin!) “Eversor, id est cyathus,” says his Riv'rence, “nam apud nos tumbleri, seu eversores, dicti sunt ab evertendo ceremoniam inter amicos; non, ut Temperantiæ Societatis frigidis fautoribus placet, ab evertendis ipsis potatoribus.” (It's not every masther undher the Boord, I tell you, could carry such a carload ov the dead langidges.) “In agro vero Louthiano et Midensi,” says he, “nomine gaudent quodam secundum linguam Anglicanam significante bombardam seu tormentum; quia ex eis tanquam ex telis jaculatoriis liquorem faucibus immitere solent. Etiam inter hæreticos illos melanostomos” (that was a touch of Greek) “Presbyterianos Septentrionales, qui sunt terribiles potatores, Cyathi dicti sunt faceres, et dimidium Cyathi hæf-a-glessus. Dimidium Cyathi verò apud Metropolitanos Hibernicos dicitur dandy—” “En verbum Anglicanum!” says the Pope, clapping his hands; “leporem te fecisti;” as much as to say that he had made a hare ov himself. “Dandoeus, dandoeus verbum erat,” says his Riv'rence—oh, the dear man, but it's himself that was handy ever and always at getting out ov a hobble— “dandoeus verbum erat,” says he, “quod dicturus eram, cum me intherpillavisti.” “Ast ego dico,” says the Pope, very sharp, “quod verbum erat dandy.” “Per tibicinem qui coram Mose modulatus est,” says his Riv'rence, “id flagellat mundum! Dan dœus dixi, et tu dicis dandy; ergo tu es lepus, non ego—Ah, ha! Saccavi vesthram Sanctitatem!” “Mendacium est!” says the Pope, quite forgetting himself, he was so mad at being sacked before the sarvints. Well, if it hadn't been that his Holiness was in it, Father Tom 'ud have given him the contints of his tumbler betuxt the two eyes, for calling him a liar; and, in troth, it's very well it was in Latin the offince was conveyed, for if it had been in the vernacular, there's no saying what 'ud ha' been the consequence. His Riv'rence was mighty angry anyhow. “Tu senex lathro,” says he, “quomodo audes me mendacem prædicare!” “Et tu, sacrilege nebulo,” says the Pope, “quomodo audacitatem habeas, me Dei in terris vicarium, lathronem conviciari?” “Interroga circumcirca,” says his Riv'rence. “Abi ex ædibus meis,” says the Pope. “Abi tu in malem crucem,” says his Riv'rence. “Excommunicabo te,” says the Pope. “Diabolus curat,” says his Riv'rence. “Anathema sis,” says the Pope. “Oscula meum pod—” says his Riv'rence—but, my dear, afore he could finish what he was going to say, the Pope broke out into the vernacular, “Get out o'my house, you reprobate!” says he, in such a rage that he could contain himself widin the Latin no longer. “Ha, ha, ha!—ho, ho, ho!” says his Riv'rence. “Who's the hare now, your Holiness? Oh, by this and by that, I've sacked you clane! Clane and clever I've done it, and no mistake! You see what a bit of desate will do wid the wisest, your Holiness— sure it was joking I was, on purpose to aggravate you—all's fair, you know, in love, law, and conthravarsy. In troth if I'd thought you'd have taken it so much to heart, I'd have put my head into the fire afore I'd have said a word to offind you,” says he, for he seen that the Pope was very vexed. “Sure God forbid that I'd say anything agin your Holiness, barring it was in fun: for aren't you the father ov the faithful, and the thrue vicar ov God upon earth? And amn't I ready to go down on my two knees this blessed minit and beg your epostolical pardon for every word that I said to your displasement?” “Are you in arnest that it is in fun you wor?” says the Pope. “May I never die if I amn't,” says his Riv'rence. “It was all to provoke your Holiness to commit a brache ov the Latin that I tuck the small liberties I did,” says he. “I'd have you to take care,” says the Pope, “how you take sich small liberties again, or may be you'll provoke me to commit a brache ov the pace.” “Well, and if I did,” said his Riv'rence, “I know a sartan preparation ov chymicals that's very good for curing a brache either in Latinity or frindship.” “What's that?” says the Pope, quite mollified, and sitting down again at the table that he had ris from in the first pluff of his indignation. “What's that?” says he, “for, 'pon my Epostolical 'davy, I think it 'udn't be asy to bate this miraclous mixthir that we've been thrying to anilize this two hours back,” says he, taking a mighty scientifical swig out ov the bottom of his tumbler. “It's good for a beginning,” says his Riv'rence: “it lays a very nate foundation for more sarious operation; but we're now arrived at a pariod ov the evening when it's time to proceed wid our shuperstructhure by compass and square, like free and excipted masons as we both are.” My time's up for the present; but I'll tell you the rest in the evening at home.</field>

Head-piece that is a diptych; the left side shows monks and knights gathered around the bed of an ill man who holds a large crucifix. The right side shows a church scholar reading a book that is on a book-stand. He is also holding a rolled-up parchment. God be wid the time when I went to the classical seminary of Firdramore! when I'd bring my sod o'turf undher my arm, and sit down on my shnug boss o'straw, wid my back to the masther and my shins to the fire, and score my sum in Dives's denominations or the double rule o'three, or play fox-and-geese wid purty Jane Cruise that sat next me, as plisantly as the day was long, widout anyone so much as saying “Mikey Heffernan, what's that you're about?”—for ever since I was in the one lodge wid poor ould Mat I had my own way in his school as free as ever I had in my mother's shebeen. God be wid them days, I say again, for it's althered times wid me, I judge, since I got under Carlisle and Whately. Sich sthrictness! sich ordher! sich dhrilling, and lecthiring, and tuthoring as they do get on wid! I wisht to gracious the one half ov their rules and rigilations was sunk in the say. And they're getting so sthrict, too, about having fair play for the heretic childher! We've to have no more schools in the chapels, nor masses in the schools. Oh, by this and by that it'll never do at all! The ould plan was twenty times betther; and, for my own part, if it wasn't that the clargy supports them in a manner, and the grant's a thing not easily done widout these hard times, I'd see if I couldn't get a sheltered spot nigh-hand the chapel, and set up again on the good ould principle: and faix, I think our Metropolitan 'ud stand to me, for I know that his Grace's motto was ever and always, that “Ignorance is the thrue mother of piety.” But I'm running away from my norration entirely, so I am. “You'll plase to ordher up the housekeeper, then,” says Father Tom to the Pope, “wid a pint ov sweet milk in a skillet, and the bulk ov her fist ov butter, along wid a dust ov soft sugar in a saucer, and I'll show you the way ov producing a decoction that, I'll be bound, will hunt the thirst out ov every nook and corner in your Holiness's blessed carcidge.” The Pope ordhered up the ingredients, and they were brought in by the head butler. “That'll not do at all,” says his Riv'rence, “the ingredients won't combine in due proportion unless ye do as I bid yez. Send up the housekeeper,” says he, “for a faymale hand is ondispinsably necessary to produce the adaptation ov the particles and the concurrence ov the corpuscles, widout which you might boil till morning, and never fetch the cruds off ov it.” Well, the Pope whispered to his head butler, and by-and-by up there comes an ould faggot ov a Caillean, that was enough to frighten a horse from his oats. “Don't thry for to desave me,” says his Riv'rence, “for it's no use, I tell yez. Send up the housekeeper, I bid yez: I seen her presarving gooseberries in the panthry as I came up: she has eyes as black as a sloe,” says he, “and cheeks like the rose in June; and sorra taste ov this celestial mixthir shall crass the lips of man or mortial this blessed night till she stirs the same up wid her own delicate little finger.” “Misther Maguire,” says the Pope, “it's very unproper ov you to spake that way ov my housekeeper: I won't allow it, sir.” “Honor bright, your Holiness,” says his Riv'rence, laying his hand on his heart. “Oh, by this and by that, Misther Maguire,” says the Pope, “I'll have none ov your insinivations: I don't care who sees my whole household,” says he; “I don't care if all the faymales undher my roof was paraded down the High Street ov Room,” says he. “Oh, it's plain to be seen how little you care who sees them,” says his Riv'rence. “You're afeared, now, if I was to see your housekeper, that I'd say she was too handsome.” “No, I'm not!” says the Pope; “I don't care who sees her,” says he. “Anthony,” says he to the head butler, “bid Eliza throw her apron over her head, and come up here.” Wasn't that stout in the blessed man? Well, my dear, up she came, stepping like a three-year-old, and blushing like the brake o' day: for though her apron was thrown over her head as she came forrid, till you could barely see the tip ov her chin— more be token there was a lovely dimple in it, as I've been tould—yet she let it shlip a bit to one side, by chance like, jist as she got forninst the fire, and if she would'nt have given his Riv'rence a shot, if he had'nt been a priest, it's no matther. “Now, my dear,” says he, “you must take that skillet, and hould it over the fire till the milk comes to a blood-hate; and the way you'll know that will be by stirring it ons't or twice wid the little finger ov your right hand, afore you put in the butther: not that I misdoubt,” says he, “but that the same finger's fairer nor the whitest milk that ever came from the tit.” “None ov your deludhering talk to the young woman, sir,” says the Pope, mighty stren. “Stir the posset as he bids you, Eliza, and then be off wid yourself,” says he. “I beg your Holiness's pardon ten thousand times,” says his Riv'rence; “I'm sure I meant nothing onproper; I hope I'm uncapable ov any sich dereliction ov my duty,” says he. “But, marciful Saver!” he cried out, jumping up on a suddent, “look behind you, your Holiness—I'm blest but the room's on fire!” Sure enough the candle fell down that minit, and was near setting fire to the windy-curtains, and there was some bustle, as you may suppose, getting things put to rights. And now I have to tell you ov a raaly onpleasant occurrence. If it was a Prodesan that was in it, I'd say that while the Pope's back was turned, Father Tom made free wid the two lips ov Miss Eliza; but, upon my conscience, I believe it was a mere mistake that his Holiness fell into on account of his being an ould man, and not having aither his eyesight or his hearing very parfect. At any rate it can't be denied but that he had a sthrong imprission that sich was the case; for he wheeled about as quick as thought, jist as his Riv'rence was sitting down, and charged him wid the offince plain and plump. “Is it kissing my housekeeper before my face you are, you villain?” says he. “Go down out o' this,” says he to Miss Eliza; “and do you be packing off wid you,” he says to Father Tom, “for it's not safe, so it isn't, to have the likes ov you in a house where there's temptation in your way.” “Is it me?” says his Riv'rence; “why, what would your Holiness be at, at all? Sure I wasn't doing no sich thing.” “Would you have me doubt the evidence ov my sinses?” says the Pope; “would you have me doubt the testimony ov my eyes and ears?” says he. Indeed I would so,” says his Riv'rence, “if they pretind to have informed your Holiness of any sich foolishness.” “Why,” says the Pope; “I seen you afther kissing Eliza as plain as I see the nose on your face; I heard the smack you gave her as plain as ever I heard thundher.” “And how do you know whether you see the nose on my face or not?” says his Riv'rence; “and how do you know whether what you thought was thundher, was thundher at all? Them operations of the sinses,” says he, “comprises only particular corporayal emotions, connected wid sartin confused perciptions called sinsations, and isn't to be depended upon at all. If we were to follow them blind guides, we might jist as well turn heretics at ons't. 'Pon my secret word, your Holiness, it's naither charitable nor orthodox ov you to set up the testimony ov your eyes and ears agin the character ov a clergyman. And now, see how aisy it is to explain all them phwenomena that perplexed you. I ris and went over beside the young woman because the skillet was boiling over, to help her to save the dhrop ov liquor that was in it; and as for the noise you heard, my dear man, it was neither more nor less nor myself dhrawing the cork out ov this blessed bottle.” “Don't offer to thrape that upon me!” says the Pope; “here's the cork in the bottle still, as tight as a wedge.” “I beg your pardon,” says his Riv'rence, “that's not the cork at all,” says he; “I dhrew the cork a good two minits ago, and it's very purtily spitted on the end of this blessed corkshcrew at this prisint moment; howandiver you can't see it, because it's only its raal prisence that's in it. But that appearance that you call a cork,” says he, “is nothing but the outward spacies and external qualities of the cortical nathur. Them's nothing but the accidents ov the cork that you're looking at and handling; but, as I tould you afore, the real cork's dhrew, and is here prisint on the end ov this nate little insthrument, and it was the noise I made in dhrawing it, and nothing else, that you mistook for the sound ov the pogue.” You know there was no conthravening what he said; and the Pope couldn't openly deny it. Howandiver he thried to pick a hole in it this way. “Granting,” says he, “that there is the differ you say betuxt the reality ov the cork and them cortical accidents, and that it's quite possible, as you allidge, that the thrue cork is really prisint on the end of the shcrew, while the accidents keep the mouth of the bottle stopped—still,” says he, “I can't undherstand, though willing to acquit you, how the dhrawing of the real cork, that's onpalpable and widout accidents, could produce the accident ov that sinsible explosion I heard jist now.” “All I can say,” says his Riv'rence, “is, that I'm sinsible it was a raal accident, anyhow.” “Ay,” says the Pope, “the kiss you gev Eliza, you mane.” “No,” says his Riv'rence, “but the report I made.” “I don't doubt you,” says the Pope. “No cork could be dhrew with less noise,” says his Riv'rence. “It would be hard for anything to be less nor nothing, barring algebra,” says the Pope. “I can prove to the conthrary,” says his Riv'rence. “This glass ov whiskey is less nor that tumbler ov punch, and that tumbler ov punch is nothing to this jug ov scaltheen.” “Do you judge by superficial misure or by the liquid contents?” says the Pope. “Don't stop me betuxt my premisses and my conclusion,” says his Riv'rence; “Ergo, this glass ov whiskey is less nor nothing; and for that raison I see no harm in life in adding it to the contents ov the same jug, just by way ov a frost-nail.” “Adding what's less nor nothing,” says the Pope, “is subthraction according to algebra; so here goes to make the rule good,” says he, filling his tumbler wid the blessed stuff, and sitting down again at the table, for the anger didn't stay two minits on him, the good-hearted ould sowl. “Two minuses makes one plus,” says his Riv'rence, as ready as you plase, “and that'll account for the increased daycrement I mane to take the liberty ov producing in the same mixed quantity,” says he, follying his Holiness's epistolical example. “By all that's good,” says the Pope, “that's the best stuff I ever tasted; you call it a mixed quantity, but I say it's prime.” “Since it's ov the first ordher, then,” says his Riv'rence, “we'll have the less deffeequilty in reducing it to a simple equation.” “You'll have no fractions at my side, anyhow,” says the Pope. “Faix, I'm afeard,” says he, “it's only too aisy ov solution our sum is like to be.” “Never fear for that,” says his Riv'rence, “I've a good stock ov surds here in the bottle; for I tell you it will take us a long time to exthract the root ov it, at the rate we're going on.” “What makes you call the blessed quart an irrational quantity?” says the Pope. “Becase it's too much for one, and too little for two,” says his Riv'rence. “Clear it ov its co-efficient, and we'll thry,” says the Pope. “Hand me over the exponent, then,” says his Riv'rence. “What's that?” says the Pope. “The shcrew, to be sure,” says his Riv'rence. “What for?” says the Pope. “To dhraw the cork,” says his Riv'rence. “Sure the cork's dhrew,” says the Pope. “But the sperits can't get out on account of the accidents that's stuck in the neck ov the bottle,” says his Riv'rence. “Accident ought to be passable to sperit,” says the Pope, “and that makes me suspect that the reality ov the cork's in it afther all.” “That's a barony-masia,” says his Riv'rence, “and I'm not bound to answer it. But the fact is, that it's the accidents ov the sperits too that's in it, and the reality's passed out through the cortical 4 spacies as you say; for, you may have observed, we've both been in raal good sperits ever since the cork was dhrawn, and where else would the raal sperits come from if they wouldn't come out ov the bottle?” “Well, then,” says the Pope, “since we've got the reality, there's no use throubling ourselves wid the accidents.” “Oh, begad,” says his Riv'rence, “the accidents is very essential too; for a man may be in the best of good sperits, as far as his immaterial part goes, and yet need the accidental qualities ov good liquor to hunt the sinsible thrist out ov him.” So he dhraws the cork in earnest, and sets about brewing the other skillet ov scaltheen; but, faix, he had to get up the ingredients this time by the hands ov ould Molly; though devil a taste ov her little finger he'd let widin a yard ov the same decoction. But, my dear, here's the Freeman's Journal, and we'll see what's the news afore we finish the residuary proceedings ov their two Holinesses.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER V. THE REASON WHY FATHER TOM WAS NOT MADE A CARDINAL. 526EAF. [Page 054]. Head-piece that depicts a royal hunt for the white stag. There are groups of hunting dogs gathered around the cornered stag, with the lead hunter pressing his sword to its neck. There are other hunters gathered in the periphery. Hurroo! my darlings!—didn't I tell you it 'ud never do? Success to bould John Tuam and the old siminary of Firdramore! Oh, more power to your Grace every day you rise, 'tis you that has broken their Boord into shivers undher your feet! Sure, and isn't it a proud day for Ireland, this blessed feast ov the chair ov Saint Pether? Isn't Carlisle and Whately smashed to pieces, and their whole college ov swaddling teachers knocked into smidhereens? John Tuam, your sowl, has tuck his pasthoral staff in his hand and beathen them out o' Connaught as fast as ever Pathrick druve the sarpints into Clew Bay. Poor ould Mat Kavanagh, if he was alive this day, 'tis he would be the happy man. “My curse upon their g'ographies and Bibles,” he used to say; “where's the use ov perplexing the poor childher wid what we don't undherstand ourselves?” no use at all, in troth, and so I said from the first myself. Well, thank God and his Grace, we'll have no more thrigonomethry nor scripther in Connaught. We'll hould our lodges every Saturday night, as we used to do, wid our chairman behind the masther's desk, and we'll hear our mass every Sunday morning wid the blessed priest standing afore the same. I wisht to goodness I hadn't parted wid my Seven Champions of Christendom and Freney the Robber; they're books that'll be in great requist in Leithrim as soon as the pasthoral gets wind. Glory be to God! I've done with their lecthirs—they may all go and be d—d wid their consumption and production. I'm off to Tullymactaggart before daylight in the morning, where I'll thry whether a sod or two o' turf can't consume a cartload ov heresy, and whether a weekly meeting ov the lodge can't produce a new thayory ov rints. But afore I take my lave ov you, I may as well finish my story about poor Father Tom that I hear is coming up to whale the heretics in Adam and Eve during the Lint. The Pope—and indeed it ill becomes a good Catholic to say anything agin him—no more would I, only that his Riv'rence was in it—but you see that the fact ov it is, that the Pope was as envious as ever he could be at seeing himself sacked right and left by Father Tom, and bate out o' the face, the way he was, on every science and subjec' that was started. So, not to be outdone altogether, he says to his Riv'rence, “You're a man that's fond ov the brute crayation, I hear, Misther Maguire?” “I don't deny it,” says his Riv'rence; “I've dogs that I'm willing to run agin any man's, ay, or to match them agin any other dogs in the world for genteel edication and polite manners,” says he. “I'll hould you a pound,” says the Pope, “that I've a quadhruped in my possession that's a wiser baste nor any dog in your kennel.” “Done,” says his Riv'rence, and they staked the money. “What can this larned quadhruped o' yours do?” says his Riv'rence. “It's my mule,” says the Pope, “and if you were to offer her goolden oats and clover off the meadows o' Paradise, sorra taste ov aither she'd let pass her teeth till the first mass is over every Sunday or holiday in the year.” “Well, and what 'ud you say if I showed you a baste of mine,” says his Riv'rence, “that instead ov fasting till the first mass is over only, fasts out the whole four-and-twenty hours ov every Wednesday and Friday in the week as reg'lar as a Christian?” “Oh, be aisy, Misther Maguire,” says the Pope. “You don't b'lieve me, don't you?” says his Riv'rence; “very well, I'll soon show you whether or no,” and he puts his knuckles in his mouth, and gev a whistle that made the Pope stop his fingers in his ears. The aycho, my dear, was hardly done playing wid the cobwebs in the cornish, when the door flies open, and in jumps Spring. The Pope happened to be sitting next the door, betuxt him and his Riv'rence, and may I never die if he did'nt clear him, thriple crown and all, at one spang. “God's presence be about us!” says the Pope, thinking it was an evil spirit come to fly away wid him for the lie that he had tould in regard ov his mule (for it was nothing more nor a thrick that consisted in grasing the brute's teeth): but, seeing it was only one ov the greatest beauties ov a greyhound that he'd ever laid his epistolical eyes on, he soon recovered ov his fright, and began to pat him, while Father Tom ris and went to the sideboord, where he cut a slice ov pork, a slice ov beef, a slice ov mutton, and a slice ov salmon, and put them all on a plate thegither. “Here, Spring, my man,” says he, setting the plate down afore him on the hearthstone, “here's your supper for you this blessed Friday night.” Not a word more he said nor what I tell you; and, you may believe it or not, but it's the blessed truth that the dog, afther jist tasting the salmon, and spitting it out again, lifted his nose out o' the plate, and stood wid his jaws wathering, and his tail wagging, looking up in his Riv'rence's face, as much as to say, “Give me your absolution, till I hide them temptations out o' my sight.” “There's a dog that knows his duty,” says his Riv'rence; “there's a baste that knows how to conduct himself aither in the parlor or the field. You think him a good dog, looking at him here; but I wisht you seen him on the side ov Slievean-Eirin! Be my soul, you'd say the hill was running away from undher him. Oh I wisht you had been wid me,” says he, never letting on to see the dog at all, “one day, last Lint, that I was coming from mass. Spring was near a quarther ov a mile behind me, for the childher was delaying him wid bread and butther at the chapel door; when a lump ov a hare jumped out ov the plantations ov Grouse Lodge and ran acrass the road; so I gev the whilloo, and knowing that she'd take the rise ov the hill, I made over the ditch, and up through Mullaghcashel as hard as I could pelt, still keeping her in view, but afore I had gone a perch, Spring seen her, and away the two went like the wind, up Drumrewey, and down Clooneen, and over the river, widout his being able ons't to turn her. Well, I run on till I come to the Diffagher, and through it I went, for the wather was low and I didn't mind being wet shod, and out on the other side, where I got up on a ditch, and seen sich a coorse as I'll be bound to say was never seen afore or since. If Spring turned that hare ons't that day, he turned her fifty times, up and down, back and for'ard, throughout and about. At last he run her right into the big quarryhole in Mullaghbawn, and when I went up to look for her fud, there I found him sthretched on his side, not able to stir a foot, and the hare lying about an inch afore his nose as dead as a door-nail, and divil a mark ov a tooth upon her. Eh, Spring, isn't that thrue?” says he. Jist at that minit the clock sthruck twelve, and, before you could say thrap-sticks, Spring had the plateful ov mate consaled. “Now,” says his Riv'rence, “hand me over my pound, for I've won my bate fairly.” “You'll excuse me,” says the Pope, pocketing his money, “for we put the clock half an hour back, out ov compliment to your Riv'rence,” says he, “and it was Sathurday morning afore he came up at all.” “Well, it's no matther,” says his Riv'rence, putting back his pound-note in his pocket-book, “only,” says he, “it's hardly fair to expect a brute baste to be so well skilled in the science ov chronology.” In troth his Riv'rence was badly used in the same bate, for he won it clever; and, indeed, I'm afeard the shabby way he was thrated had some effect in putting it into his mind to do what he did. “Will your Holiness take a blast ov the pipe?” says he, dhrawing out his dhudeen. “I never smoke,” says the Pope, “but I haven't the laste objection to the smell ov the tobaccay.” “Oh, you had better take a dhraw,” says his Riv'rence, “it'll relish the dhrink, that 'ud be too luscious entirely, widout something to flavor it.” “I had thoughts,” said the Pope, wid the laste sign ov a hiccup on him, “of getting up a broiled bone for the same purpose.” “Well,” says his Riv'rence, “a broiled bone 'ud do no manner ov harm at this present time; but a smoke,” says he, “'ud flavor both the devil and the dhrink.” “What sort o' tobaccay is it that's in it?” says the Pope. “Raal nagur-head,” says his Riv'rence; “a very mild and salubrious spacies ov the philosophic weed.” “Then I don't care if I do take a dhraw,” says the Pope. Then Father Tom held the coal himself till his Holiness had the pipe lit; and they sat widout saying anything worth mentioning for about five minutes. At last the Pope says to his Riv'rence, “I dunna what gev me this plaguy hiccup,” says he. “Dhrink about,” says he; “Begorra,” he says, “I think I'm getting merrier nor's good for me. Sing us a song, your Riv'rence,” says he. Father Tom then sung him Mortagrenoge and the Bunch o' Rushes, and he was mighty well pleased wid both, keeping time wid his hands, and joining in in the choruses, when his hiccup 'ud let him. At last, my dear, he opens the lower buttons ov his waistcoat, and the top one ov his waistband, and calls to Masther Anthony to lift up one ov the windys. “I dunna what's wrong wid me, at all at all,” says he, “I'm mortial sick.” “I thrust,” says his Riv'rence, “the pasthry that you ate at dinner hasn't disagreed wid your Holiness's stomach.” “Oh my! oh!” says the Pope, “what's this at all?” gasping for breath, and as pale as a sheet, wid a could swate bursting out over his forehead, and the palms ov his hands spread out to catch the air. “Oh my!—oh my!” says he, “fetch me a basin!—Don't spake to me! Oh!—oh!—blood alive!—Oh, my head, my head, hould my head!— oh!—ubh!—I'm poisoned!—ach!” “It was them plaguy pasthries,” says his Riv'-rence. “Hould his head hard,” says he, “and clap a wet cloth over his timples. If you could only thry another dhraw o' the pipe, your Holiness, it 'ud set you to rights in no time.” “Carry me to bed,” says the Pope, “and never let me see that wild Irish priest again. I'm poisoned by his manes—upblsch!—ach!—ach!—He dined with Cardinal Wayld yesterday,” says he, “and he's bribed him to take me off. Send for a confissor,” says he, “for my latther end's approaching. My head's like to split—so it is!—Oh my! oh my! —upblsch!—ach! Well, his Riv'rence never thought it worth his while to make him an answer; but, when he seen how ungratefully he was used, afther all his throuble in making the evening agreeable to the ould man, he called Spring, and put the but-end ov the second bottle into his pocket, and left the house widout once wishing “Good-night, an' plaisant dhrames to you;” and in troth, not one of them axed him to lave them a lock ov his hair. That's the story as I heard it tould; but myself doesn't b'lieve over one half ov it. Howandiver, when all's done, it's a shame, so it is, that he's not a bishop this blessed day and hour; for, next to the goiant ov St. Jarlath's, he's out and out the cleverest fellow ov the whole jing-bang.
