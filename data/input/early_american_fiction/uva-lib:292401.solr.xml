      <field name="fulltext">KATE, THE ACCOMPLICE. CHAPTER I. The Burglar's Home. Midway between Cross and Blackstone streets, and nearly parallel to them, is a short, narrow, disagreeable avenue, connecting Hanover street with Ann. It is but a minute's walk from one end of this alley to the other, but there are many objects within its narrow limits to attract the notice of the most careless passenger. To say nothing of the stores and shops of various descriptions huddled together there, the dwelling houses offer much food for curiosity and study. Some of these appear to be making sickly attempts at respectability, but for the most part they are dirty, miserable abodes, fit only for the very dregs of society. The most remarkable of the latter class of dwelling houses, and, in fact, the most prominent object in the whole street, is a small, oblong block of three story wooden buildings, quite isolated from the other structures in the vicinity. One end of this row fronts on the street, while entrance is gained to the houses in the rear by threading an open space which surrounds the entire block. Nothing can be more uninviting than the outward appearance of these miserable houses, unless it be the scene that usually presents itself within. The exterior was evidently once painted yellow, but the clapboards have been so worn by the winds and rains of half a century, that their color at present appears to be in a very unsettled state. At the period of the opening of our tale, the block in question was crowded with tenants of various descriptions. Some were the families of sailors, others were poor laborers, others were dissolute and vicious occupants, who existed in a mysterious manner, but in one respect all seemed alike, whatever difference there might be in their characters and pursuits. All were poor. Let us view the interior of one of these houses. Entering a dilapidated doorway, and mounting a dark, dingy creaking staircase, we find our nostrils saluted by odors, and our ears by sounds, which, to those unaccustomed to them, would at first be rather disagreeable. The walls are smoky and the wood-work worn and broken in numerous places. Grotesque figures have been drawn by wanton hands upon the doors, and erased in a careless, slovenly manner. Let us mount two flights of stairs, and enter one of the rooms to visit its inmates. It was night, and there was but a dim light in the chamber. It was a narrow, miserable apartment, with a small stove near the centre, a low bed in one corner, and a cupboard on the side opposite the door.— The floor and walls stood much in need of washing, and the old and scanty furniture in the room showed a great lack of neatness and order. There was but one individual in the chamber, and he was sitting near the stove, in which there was a small fire. He sat leaning over the glowing coals, gazing intently through the black grate, and listening to the ncessant singing of an iron kettle on the stove, like one who is either overcome by drowsiness, or occupied with deep thought. But Isaac Gordon was evidently far from sleeping, if we may judge from the lustre of his keen black eye, as the fire shone upon it. That eye twinkled with deep cunning, and indicated the shrewd, daring, avaricious character of its possessor. Isaac Gordon was about forty years of age, dark complexioned, well formed, and athletic. His coarse features denoted a predominance of the baser passions in his nature, while they were still marked with intelligence and firmness. His dress was of coarse material, and somewhat worn, but after all it seemed too good to correspond with the surrounding objects in the room. He had been sitting in the position in which we have described him for near half an hour, when with a muttered curse he arose impatiently, and walked across the room. `What in h—can keep her away so long?' he growled, looking at a heavy, old fashioned silver watch he drew from his waistcoat pocket. `It is now near eight o'clock, and she said she would be back at seven. The lying hag! She knew that Kate would be gone to-night, and that I'd rather starve than cook my own supper.' Gordon was about to give way to his impatience in divers expressions we need not repeat, when he heard a sound of footsteps on the stairs. `Her at last!' he exclaimed, his quick eye lighting up with eager curiosity. `I wonder what luck she has had.' The door opened and an old woman appeared upon the threshold. She was very tall and strong for one of her sex, and her features were bold and irregular. She was, perhaps, no older than the man, but her hair was thin and gray, her brow wrinkled, and her complexion sallow, which made her appear at least a dozen years older than she really was. Yet her form was erect, and she had lost none of the strength or activity of her younger days. Throwing off her rude bonnet and coarse shawl, this being advanced to the fire and began rubbing her long bony hands over the coals, without deigning a single answer to the questions Gordon asked on the moment she entered. At last, having sat down and motioned him to a chair, she appeared ready to speak. `I have had some success,' she said, in a low, guttural tone, raising her small twinkling eyes to the face of her companion. `Well you might!' retorted Gordon, with a sneer; `for you have been gone an age.— What kept you so long?' `Your business more than mine,' replied the old woman, sullenly. `Well, I don't mean to find fault; only, I want to hear how you made out. Is there such a man living anywhere in the place?' `There is one Henry P. Acton there— and I have reason to believe—' `That he is my man,' interrupted Gordon, eagerly. `Well.' `I have seen him,' said the woman. `His appearance corresponds with your description of him.' `Then it is him!' exclaimed Gordon, clapping his hands with delight. `Henry P. Acton—not a very common name—Maggy,' he cried, suddenly interrupting himself, `this discovery is worth a thousand dollars to us!' `It is worth something, at least,' returned his companion, in a significant whisper— 'For, even though you are building castles in the air, I have a scheme which will—' `Never mind your schemes,' interrupted Gordon, impatently, `for I am sure of mine —and that is enough. I tell you I am in possession of some secret knowledge about this Action, which will command his dollars as long as he has any, or I am alive. But tell me how he looks.' `As you described him, nearly. He is tall, of a delicate constitution, thin in flesh, but handsome—and a little gray, though he can't be more than five and thirty years of age.' `The natural color of his hair—' `Is jet black.' `And the scar?' `As you said, there is a scar on the left cheek, near the ear.' `He is my man!' exclaimed Gordon, unable to conceal his delight. `Oh! I tell you, Maggy, if he is as rich as I have heard he is, or as he once was, our fortune is made!' `And he is rich, or there is no such thing as riches!' returned the old woman. `He lives in a beautiful house, has a fine garden and an orchard, and keeps a carriage. His family—' `Ah! yes—his family!' `He has an angel for a wife, and a son— a proud, handsome little boy, about eight years old. There is a girl about eighteen living with him; she is either his or his wife's sister.' `How did you learn all this?' `Of one of the domestics, whom I managed to get into conversation with. By the way, let me tell you of the scheme I have formed. To-morrow, one of Mr. Action's servant girls goes away, as she is to be married in a week; we must get Kate to fill the vacant situation.' `Nonsense!' sneered Gordon. `Why so?' demanded his companion, sharply; `I tell you we can take advantage of the circumstance, so that whether your plans fail or not, we will be bettered by it. Let Kate once get into the family, and we shall have a spy over there that'll be worth the while. If there is money or plate in the house, she can find it out, and without being herself suspected, she can manage to help you break the nut and get the meat.' Having made this proposition in a bold, confident manner, the old woman fixed her keen eyes intently upon her companion, who seemed absorbed in deep thought. `What do you say?' she demanded, after a pause. Gordon raised his eyes to hers, and asked in a cool, significant tone— `Will Kate go?' `If I say so, she will!' replied the old woman, with a haughty toss of the head. She has always obeyed me.' `To her remorse and shame,' added a low, reproachful voice at the door. The two turned, and beheld the object of their remarks standing upon the threshold. She was a girl about twenty years of age, tall and slender, but well proportioned, and beautiful, notwithstanding her cheek was pale and care-worn. Her features were regular and delicately chiseled, her hair of a beautiful auburn, and her eyes of a soft deep blue, large and full of expression. She was thinly clad, and the faded plaid shawl, dirty calico dress, and old-fashioned straw bonnet she wore, indicated a carelessness in regard to her appearance which ill accorded with her natural charms. Such was Kate Munson: and before we proceed farther with our narrative, it would be well for us to say a few words in explanation of her present situation, and of her relationship with the two individuals with whom the reader has already become acquainted. Kate's parents were dead, and she had lived for several years with the woman we have already introduced, who was her aunt by marriage. Her history we shall dwell upon on some future occasion, but suffice it to say, at present, that it resembled that of too many of her sex. She was once virtuous— but being exposed to temptation, which her aunt assisted in laying before her, she fell, and sunk into the wretched thing we now behold her. Her aunt had been married, but her husband having died some years before, and she being naturally prone to evil, a relationship had been established between her and Gordon, of the most intimate, though of no very moral, nature. As the reader ha probably divined, Gordon was one of those individuals who look upon the world as owing them a living, which they are determined to have in spite of both law and justice. He was a gambler and house-breaker; but having been most unfortunate in pursuing the former profession, he chiefly devoted his time and talents to the latter. The old woman assisted him, and Kate occasionally lent her hand; for having fallen, and become an associate with the vicious, she experienced few scruples of conscience when called upon to do as the vicious did. These three individuals lived together in the house in Centre street we have described, and occupied two rooms, one of which was the apartment where the foregoing scene took place. The other room was Kate's, it being quite small and uncomfortable for more than one; while the other was of sufficient dimensions to serve both as a bed room for Gordon and Margaret, and a kitchen for the three, to say nothing of other uses to which it was occasionally put. `I have been influenced by you and obeyed you to my shame and sorrow,' repeated Kate, entering the room abruptly. She fixed her reproachful eyes upon her aunt, who looked up to her with a sneer upon her lips. `What now?' asked Margaret, contemptuously. `Has the conscientious creature suddenly been struck with the magnitude of her sins?' `No more than I have always been,' replied Kate, sullenly; `I am bad enough, you know as well as I—and I delight in being so —but I can't help thinking, sometimes, how good and happy I might now be had you not prevented me, and helped to bring about my ruin.' Kate spoke bitterly, and her aunt replied not for some seconds, as if she feared to rouse the spirit she knew the girl possessed. It was her policy to humor her on the present occasion, in order to prevail upon her to act according to her wishes, for Mag had formed almost a romantic idea of the advantages to be gained by establishing her as a domestic, or rather as a spy and an accomplice, in the family of Mr. Acton. She made the proposition in a kind way, and represented it in its most attractive point of view, endeavoring to make Kate believe it was more for her interest than for her own that she should comply. Leaving the girl to reflect and conclude, Mag set about preparing supper—a rude meal which consisted of roasted potatoes, fried pork, and baker's bread. Gordon seemed to care little whether Kate went or not, for he sat by the fire, his head upon his hands, a smile of triumph on his features, and an expression of eager avarice and deep determination in his eye. CHAPTER II. The Deception. MAG MUNSON was busily engaged preparing the evening meal, Kate was sitting by the stove, with her bonnet in her hand, looking sadly and drowsily into the fire, and Gordon's brain was teeming with bright dreams of the golden fruits he was to gather by the secret knowledge he possessed of Mr. Acton, when the door was opened and a fourth individual entered the room. A young man about three and twenty years of age, straight, well-made, strong and active; his complexion dark, his features bold, intelligent, and handsome, though marked by dissipation, and his bearing reckless. He wore a cloth cap, which sat carelessly on his finely shaped head, a checkered shirt, the collar of which was turned loosely over a black cravat, a coat of fine cloth that was getting somewhat threadbare, and pantaloons of a corresponding quality. Such was the appearance of Joseph Jenks, better known to his associates by the name of Light Joe. Young as he was, he was old in iniquity, and gloried in the same profession as Gordon. He was on the most intimate terms with the characters we have introduced; especially with Kate, whose accepted lover he was. Joseph advanced into the room in the most familiar manner, and kicking Gordon's shins as he passed him, went directly up to Kate. `Come, my chick,' said he, playfully, without noticing the curse Gordon bestowed upon him for his impudence; `what the devil ails you that you look so down in the mouth? What are you dreaming about?' `About you,' replied Kate, smiling sadly. `The deuce you are!' exclaimed Light Joe, kissing her. `I must say you are a good girl, and you like me, I am sure,' he added, in an under tone; `but cheer up now, and talk with me, Kate. In the first place, what is the matter?' To avoid giving any other answer, Kate replied that she was going away; and when he expressed his surprise, she explained to him her aunt's reasons for placing her in a situation, without telling what private reasons she might have for complying with Mag's wishes. Notwithstanding the depravity of Kate and her lover, there was something like true affection in their feelings towards each other, and it was accordingly with regret that Joseph thought of her going away, even for a limited time. `How far is it,' he asked, `to where this Acton lives?' `Five miles, I should say, at least,' replied Mag. `It may be more.' `The devil it is!' exclaimed Joe. `Why, Kate, do you suppose I'd care enough about seeing you to go that distance, even though there was no difficulty in having an interview with you?' `I hope so,' said Kate, `for I have concluded to go, provided I can get the situation.' `Which isn't very probable,' returned Joe. `These people always want good recommendations, and I'm sure nobody'd take you without.' `I leave that to Mag.' `And Mag will get you the situation; see if she don't,' put in the old woman, confidently. `I have my own ideas of things, and my own plans, and I don't often fail, you all know.' `You're shrewd, the devil knows,' retorted Joe, contemptuously, `but you may as well not try your cunning in this, for you'll be sure to lose character.' Old Mag deigned no reply to this remark, but continued about her work, leaving Joseph and Kate to have a season of private conversation undisturbed. `This is a new start,' said Joe, in a whisper, `and I can't understand it. Are you determined to go?' `Yes,' replied Kate, firmly. `Yes! and you never consulted me about the matter, at all! I have given up every girl for you, and I have thought I would marry you some day, and this is the way you treat me!' `Joseph,' said Kate, candidly, `I did wrong to say I would go without asking you —and now, if you `say no, why, I'll stay here.' `And do you think I'll say so? No, Kate; go, if you think best, but—don't forget me,' added Joe, seriously. `You are not a changing creature, I know, Kate, but when I think that you loved Dick Marvin once, and hate him now—' `Marvin deceived me—lied to me and betrayed my innocence!' interrupted Kate, vehemently, `and that is why I hate him!— You have always used me well and been frank with me, Joseph, and, although you have done nothing to restore me to virtue, I cannot blame you for anything. I became yours deliberately—you have not deceived me—and now, whether you marry me or not, I cannot complain. With Marvin it is different—' `I saw him to-night,' interrupted Joseph, anxious to change the conversation. `He's as proud, daring, and dissipated as ever.— He has been unfortunate in play, lately, and has contracted some debts, which have caused his creditors to look around to find where he lives. How strange, Kate, that as long as we have known him, we have never been able to learn his place of residence!' Kate made no reply, but sat musing in her chair until the old woman called her to supper. Joe whispered a few words of privacy in her ear, and soon after departed, leaving the three gathered around a low miserable table, partaking of their humble meal in silence. It was near ten o'clock when Gordon went out, to join the society of some of his vicious companions, and pursue his secret midnight occupations. Left alone together, Mag Munson and her niece busied themselves in preparing a few articles of decent clothing for the latter, that she might appear as respectable as possible at her first interview with the family of the Actons. The sun had but just risen on the following morning, when Kate and her aunt, both dressed in their most respectable clothing, left their miserable abode in Centre street, and pursued their way at a quick pace towards Ann street. It was a beautiful October morning, but the air was cold and biting, and only the roofs of the houses were warmed by the rays of the sun. Men were abroad in their overcoats, and the shop girls that hurried along the street were, for the most part, warmly clad. Kate was quite comfortably dressed, and Margaret was accustomed to such weather, so that neither suffered very severely from the cold. The two women were soon in Washington street, pursuing their way, on foot, towards Roxbury. As they passed along, Margaret was continually talking to Kate in low, hurried accents of their plans, and teaching her how she should act on the occasion of her appearance before the Actons. She endeavored to impress her niece with the importance of her playing the hypocrite in the most subtle and cautious manner, and of keeping her eye continually upon her own interest, and that of her friends. Kate promised every thing her aunt required, although her mind was far from being on the subject nearest to Margaret's heart. It is a long walk to Roxbury, but the two were soon beyond the Neck, for they traveled rapidly, and were accustomed to fatigue. But they had not yet reached their journey's end. Striking out boldly into the country, they pursued an uneven, winding road, which conducted them into the midst of beautiful scenery, and offered a cheering contrast to the crowded streets of the town. The air was still cold, but the sun's rays fell warmly on the earth, and added fresh charms to the country through which they passed. Kate delighted in such scenery, but it made her melancholy by the reflections it called up, for she could not forget the difference between her lot and that of the young girls she there saw so happy. They passed by several beautiful residences, until they came to one that pleased Kate more than all the rest. The house itself was not very large, but it was built in the most tasteful style of architecture, and every thing about it bore the appearance of care, neatness, and taste. The grounds were well laid out and extensive, and the whole was situated in the most romantic portion of the country. `This is the place,' said Margaret, opening the gate; `how do you like it?' Kate sighed, and without replying to the old woman's question, followed her in silence along the path that led to the house. Margaret did not enter at the front door, but like one already acquainted with the locality, sought out a back passage, which gave her admittance to the kitchen. A middle aged, plainly dressed, good natured looking woman met our adventurers on the threshold, and took Margaret cordially by the hand. She was the domestic the old woman had conversed with on the day before, and by her cautious deceit had succeeded in interesting in her favor. `I am glad to see you again,' said Mrs. Barnes, leading them into the kitchen; `is this the girl you was speaking about?' `Yes, this is my niece,' replied Margaret, looking at Kate with a well feigned appearance of affection; `ever since you first spoke of there being a vacant situation here, I have become every time I thought of it more and more anxious the poor girl should fill it. Her health is poor, and a residence in the country is the very thing she needs.' `Poor girl!' exclaimed Mrs. Barnes, casting a pitying glance at Kate, who dropped her eyes, looking confused. Poor girl, indeed; for, depraved as she had become, she could not give countenance to a lie without feeling abashed. `Are you used to house work?' asked Mrs. Barnes, addressing Kate. `Yes, ma'am,' faltered the girl. She said so, however, without lying, for when young she had learned to do every description of work in a dwelling house. `Then I think you would suit us,' pursued the domestic, `for I like your looks very well. I will speak to Mrs. Acton.' Kate and her aunt could not but look at each other and smile, after Mrs. Barnes had left the room; but their countenances resumed their serious expression when that respectable matron returned in company with the mistress of the house. Mrs. Acton was near thirty years of age, but time had destroyed none of her youthful beauty. Her complexion was as fair and brilliant, her brow as smooth, and her eye as bright and full of expression, as they had ever been; and that was saying much. She was in every respect a lovely woman, and as amiable and intelligent as she was beautiful. In disposition she was benevolent, mild, and kind; yet there was a spirit of dignity and noble pride within her, which gave her greater strength of character than one would have supposed, from her appearance, she possessed. Nothing could be more winning than her smile, although she was never gay. Mrs. Barnes used to say she had never seen her otherwise than mild and pleasant, but that there was always a melancholy expression in her countenance, which she could not understand, it was so sweet and winning. Such was the lady who accompanied the housekeeper to the kitchen, where Kate and her companion sat waiting. She looked at Kate kindly, and seemed pleased with her appearance, for the girl never looked more beautiful than on that occasion. Her walk in the cold air had given a rosy tint to her delicate cheek which it rarely possessed, and her dress, although very plain, was tastefully arranged, and displayed her form to the best advantage. She had an appearance of modesty, too, which was not feigned, for she could not look upon the pure and beautiful lady before her without feeling a confusing sense of her own depravity. After speaking a few words to Kate, Mrs. Acton turned to Mrs. Barnes and asked her if she thought the girl could supply the place of the domestic who was about going away, and on being answered in the affirmative, inquired of Kate if she had brought recommendations of character and ability. `Her last employer,' put in Margaret, readily, `gave her no recommendations, because there was some difficulty between them.' `Indeed!' exclaimed Mrs. Acton. `I dislike to mention it,' pursued Margaret, `but he was a bad man, and insulted the poor girl; which drove her away before her time was up. He was offended, and would neither pay her her just dues, nor give her a recommendation. However, if it is necessary, I think I can get a satisfactory character for her of a former employer, who was every way pleased with her.' This lie was uttered with such profound dissimulation, and with such apparent truthfulness, that Mrs. Acton was thrown entirely off her guard. She looked at the blushing Kate with more of pity than distrust, and to the great delight of Margaret, said the girl's appearance was sufficient recommendation, and that she did not hesitate to take her on trial. `Can she commence to-day?' asked Mrs. Barnes. `As well as any time,' replied Margaret. `I will bring her her clothes, or send them, in a day or two, for I've no doubt but she'll suit you.' `I hope she will,' said Mrs. Acton, leaving the room, `for I like her already.' Margaret soon after took her leave, and Kate was duly installed in the household of the Acton family, under the supervision of the excellent Mrs. Barnes. CHAPTER III. Acton Hall. TO a young girl accustomed to household duties, the situation Kate had engaged to occupy was all that could be desired. The family was small and pleasant, and her labors light; and the excellent housekeeper, Mrs. Barnes, she found to be a most agreeable companion. Kate was naturally intelligent and active, and having been accustomed, some years before, to housework, she was soon able to perform any duties that devolved upon her; so ready, indeed, did Mrs Barnes find her, that, scrupulous and particular as she was in domestic matters, she did not hesitate to give her her unqualified approbation. Kate, too, found her duties less tedious than she had dared expect. She liked the country air, its freshness and purity contrasted so advantageously with the stagnant atmosphere of her residence in town. She even began to feel an exhilarating joy, occasioned by the active, innocent course of life she was leading, and the calm pleasures of a country residence, when the reflection that she had introduced herself into that happy family for a most unrighteous purpose, turned all her joyful sensations into feelings of remorse and bitterness. Kate could not but love the family it was her design to rob, or assist in robbing. Mrs. Acton won her affections at the first interview, and she was no less pleased with Edith Irving, Mrs. Acton's sister. This young lady was scarcely eighteen, and her appearance was very much as one would have imagined her sister's to have been at that age. In disposition, too, they were alike, although Edith was, perhaps, more impetuous than Mrs. Acton had ever been, and united more power of will with the excellent qualities she possessed in common with her sister.— To a mere admirer of beauty, the heart having nothing to do with the question, it is difficult to say which would have appeared to the best advantage, Edith or Mrs. Acton; for, although much alike, the soft beauty and pleasing melancholy of the latter contrasted strangely with her sister's more brilliant charms, her innocent gayety and freshness of spirits. Having said thus much of the family in question, it would be unpardonable in us were we to pass on without bestowing a moment's attention upon its head, who, by right, should have been mentioned first. Mr. Acton, who may be considered one of the principal characters in this history, was a gentleman of the most agreeable manners, although cold and distant when it was not his humor to be civil. He was seldom influenced by the generous impulses which governed his wife, yet he had the reputation of being a benevolent man. Although wealthy, it could never be laid to his charge that he had horded up or made a bad use of his riches, for his selfishness consisted in other things. He had never been taught to deny himself aught that could administer to his individual happiness, and it may be seen in the course of this history, that he sometimes gratified his desires at the peril of some occasional pangs of conscience. Mr. Acton loved his wife devotedly, and perhaps she was the only being on earth who possessed any influence over his disposition; for, although independent, cold, and severe before the world, he was quite the contrary whenever he came in contact with her. In fact, he valued her love and esteem more than he would have done the homages of the world. Kate could not but respect Mr. Acton, although she dreaded his presence, and did not like him. She saw at once that he was not altogether happy, surrounded as he was by all that can make life agreeable, and judged that there must be some secret family trouble which caused both him and his wife to appear so melancholy. Kate, the reader will observe, was not so depraved as to be dead to the finer feelings of our nature. She had sympathies which could be aroused, and affections that she could not govern. She had resolved, before hand, to dislike the whole family, so that when the time came for her to wrong them, she could do so without a pang; but before she had been with them a day, she found that she felt something like love for them all, Mr. Acton excepted. In the whole family there was none, perhaps, she felt stronger affection for than little Robert Acton— her employer's only child. He was a pale, delicate boy of four years, but spirited and intelligent beyond his age. Kate had been three days in this family, and no suspicions on the part of her employers, or fears of discovery on her own part, had been awakened. An incident, however, came near deranging all her schemes on the fourth day of her residence in the country. There was a young clergyman of talent and respectability paying his addresses to Edith Irving, and he was looked upon as a favored suitor. His features were bold and irregular, yet handsome; his eye quick and full of expression; his forehead broad and lofty; and his form possessed of manly proportions. He was an Englishman by birth, and nothing was known of him except what he himself had given out; but he had been placed at the head of a respectable congregation, and had always conducted himself with propriety before the world, thus gaining a reputation for sobriety and piety, which it grieves us to say, young, unmarried clergyman do not always possess. One day the young clergyman had been conversing with Mrs. Acton and her sister, in the parlor, when Kate, in obedience to Mrs. Barnes' directions, entered to put some wood on the fire. She did not look up until she had disposed of the fuel, when she turned to listen to Mrs. Acton, who wished to give her some directions. For the first time her eye fell on the young clergyman, and with a shriek, turning as pale as death, she sank fainting to the floor. `What is the meaning of this?' asked Mrs. Acton, alarmed. `Edith, call Mrs. Barnes—the poor girl has fainted!' She lifted Kate in her arms, and applied to her lips and brow the contents of a small vial, which revived her immediately. `Where is — oh, God!—' murmured Kate, incoherently, opening her eyes in alarm. They rested on the young clergyman, and she closed them again, shuddering. `What can be the matter?' asked he, betraying no emotion save that of curiosity. `Did she ever see you before?' asked Mrs. Acton. `Not to my knowledge,' replied the clergyman, coolly; `I have not the least recollection of having seen her anywhere.' `It was at sight of you she fainted,' said Edith—`at least, it appeared so to me.' `Ask her if she ever saw me before,' returned the clergyman, self-possessed as ever. `I am curious to know.' Mrs. Acton put the question, but Kate made no reply. Mrs. Barnes had now arrived, and the girl was taken out of the room. If she had thought Everett—the young clergyman—knew her, and would expose her, she was quite mistaken; for he denied all knowledge of her, and convinced Mrs. Acton and Edith that her fainting could not have been caused by his presence —or, at least, that he knew nothing of the matter. Kate, on being questioned afterwards, said that her fainting was quite accidental, she being subject to such fits on the most trifling occasions. Thus the incident passed off unnoticed. But it had a strange effect on Kate. She was agitated during the whole day, and when night came she could not sleep. `He here!' she said to herself. `My God! who would have thought it?' On the following day a young man called at Acton Hall, and enquired for Kate. `I have a message from her aunt,' said the visitor; `can I see her?' As the young man had a bundle of clothes for Kate, Mrs. Barnes called her, and told her a person at the hall door wished to see her. `Ha! my bird, cried Light Joe; `what's the best word? How do you like your situation, eh?' Kate looked around to see that there was nobody listening, then placing her arm upon his shoulder, whispered in his ear. `No!' exclaimed Joseph, starting and turning pale. `True!' whispered Kate. `I saw him yesterday—and it was so sudden—you can't imagine what an effect it had upon me.' `He will not expose you to the Actons, will he?' asked Light Joe. `He dares not!' `Right! he dares not! But where does he live?' `You can learn that easily.' Joe's features brightened. `This is good news,' he resumed, after a moment's reflection. `Now is the time for revenge! Have you reflected, Kate, that we have him in our power? The Reverend Mr. Everett! ha! ha!' `Hush!' exclaimed Kate in an agitated whisper—`there he comes!' In effect, the Reverend Mr. Everett was approaching the house, and Kate had discovered him through the half-opened door. `The devil will be to pay if he sees me!' exclaimed Joseph, grasping the arm of the trembling Kate. `Where can you hide me?' A happy thought struck him, and before Kate could reply, he dodged into the corner and opened the hall door, which swinging around concealed him from the view of any person in the hall. Kate, pale and agitated, endeavored to escape to the kitchen, but the clergyman overtook her before she had traversed half the hall. `The villain!' muttered Joe, peeping out from his hiding place; `the damnable hypocrite!' The preacher held Kate by the arm, and his keen, piercing eyes were fixed with a look of terrible meaning upon the girl's pale features. `Kate Munson!' he exclaimed, in a passionate whisper; `we know each other— but let there be an end to our acquaintance! You know my character—it is revengeful! Need I say more?' Kate made no reply, but trembled, and shrunk from his touch with a look of terror. `Hear me!' pursued the preacher. `If you dare even hint at what you know of me, before the Actons—if you give me the slightest cause to suspect that you will expose me, you shall repent it to the last hour of your existence!' So saying, with a flushed cheek and flashing eye, the clergyman pushed Kate from him rudely, and composing his features with great self-control, walked leisurely into the presence of Edith Irving. `Ha! ha!' laughed Joe, nervously darting from his hiding place. `The Reverend Mr. Everett, Kate,' he continued, rubbing his hands, `is cool; devilish cool. But I'll warm him one of these days—see if I don't! ha! ha!' `Go, Joe—go!' whispered the agitated girl. `I have much to say to you—but not now! Meet me this evening, at dusk, in the corner of the orchard. I shall be at liberty then. But leave me now—you must!' The next moment the hall-door was closed, and Light Joe was walking rapidly down the road. CHAPTER IV. The Rendezvous. AT sundown, on the same day, Joseph Jenks stepped out of one of the Boston and Roxbury omnibuses, at the latter place, and took the road that led to the residence of the Actons. Arrived there, he found Kate already at the place of rendezvous, agreeably to their plan, she having excused herself to Mrs. Barnes, and stolen into the orchard unobserved. It was a secluded spot, but a short distance from the road, and one in which the two could meet without fear of being surprised. It was already dark when Light Joe arrived, but the moon arising, gave promise of a beautiful and brilliant night. `What more of the Rev. Mr. Everett?' asked Joe, after having greeted his mistress with becoming tenderness. `The villain!' exclaimed Kate, `I am afraid he has won the affections of Miss Irving—for she knows nothing of him whatever. If she should marry him, and learn afterwards what a man he is, it would kill her —break her heart!' `That is none of our business,' said Joe. `Let him work. We will not forget him— revenge will yet be ours. I have just learned where he lives, and I shall be down upon him soon. But how is the business I came to speak with you about? Have you found where they keep the plate?' `Yes,' replied Kate, stifling her conscience and strengthening her heart to carry out her original design against the Actons. `It is a rich haul for you, Joe, I assure you.' And the girl proceeded to name over certain articles of silver ware, at which Light Joe could not conceal his interest and delight. `But the money—have you found where he keeps it?' asked the young burglar, eagerly. `Not yet. I have my eye on a place which I suspect contains a treasure, but I ain't certain. It was chiefly on this account that I wanted to see you to-night. You must give me the keys you mentioned, and I will try them on the bureaus and chests I can get access to, and if they fit I'll soon be able to tell you where you'll find the money.' `I come prepared,' returned Joe; `Here is a good assortment I've brought on purpose for you. Be cautious, Kate, and shrewd— be devilish shrewd—for recollect your interests are mine and mine are yours. Gordon and I are to divide the spoils between us— old Meg shares with him, and you with me. Find out where the money is—get keys to fit all the doors, drawers and safes that contain any thing valuable; then lend a hand to help Gordon and me off with it, and— What the devil is that?' This sudden interruption, and rough remark were occasioned by a rustling movement in the leaves close by, and a deep growl scarce a dozen feet from the spot where Joseph stood. By the light of the newly risen moon, the startled couple beheld a large, black, ferocious looking dog ready to spring upon them. `By —!' muttered Joe, snatching a dirk-knife from his pocket and opening it in an instant. Stand away, Kate, and let him come.' `Instead of complying, the girl, without losing her presence of mind, advanced boldly towards the dog, spoke to him, and patted him on the neck. The fierce animal was tame and peaceable as a lamb. `It's Pluto, Joe,' said Kate. `I forgot to mention him. He is a faithful friend, but a terrible enemy—not one of the barking breed, but one that is not afraid to bite.— Mr. Acton keeps him shut up by day, and let's him out nights. He knows me, you see, for I feed him, and do all I can to make him like me. He's a good fellow.' `Good fellow, and be d—!' exclaimed Joe, who had not yet recovered from his excitement. `It wouldn't be a very pious notion to have him about our ears when we come for the plate and money. The devil take the black imp! he would just knock our plans all in the head if we should attempt to break into the house when he was loose.— Kate, you must manage some way to get rid of him.' Pluto was beginning to smell of Joe, as if glad to make his acquaintance, and Joe was caressing him, while, Judas like, he was at the same time plotting against his life, when suddenly the dog pricked up his ears, as if he heard some suspicious noise, and uttered a deep growl. `Hush, Pluto!' said Kate. And the animal was silent. It was well for Joe and his mistress, however, that the dog was with them, for his quick ears had discovered the approach of two persons, and given the couple timely warning which enabled them to couceal themselves before the new comers suspected their presence. They withdrew at once to the shadow of a fence, which hid them effectually from the view of the two strangers. Kate called the obedient Pluto with her, and made him lie down by her side. `Now speak,' said one of the new comers, `we are alone. What business have you with me?' `If you knew me, you could guess,' replied the other, significantly. `If I knew you? I have never seen you before!' retorted the first speaker. `You are mistaken, Mr. Acton. You know me well. Look at me now!' And the speaker removed his cap from his brow, and by the light of the moon, which cast its bright silvery rays upon his face, discovered to the eyes of the astonished listeners, the features of Isaac Gordon. Yet Mr. Acton did not seem to know him. He looked full into his face, and scrutinized his features closely, still failing to recognize them. `I know you not,' said he. `Who are you?' `Would you know my name?' asked Gordon with a malicious grin. `Speak!' Gordon looked cautiously around him, as fearing lest his secret should be overheard, then placing his hand on Acton's arm, and looking him full in the face, whispered a single word in his ear. Mr. Acton started back, and staggered as if smitten by a deadly blow. `Do you know me now?' demanded Gordon, still holding him by the arm. And he continued to gaze at him with a look of malicious triumph. Mr. Acton was pale as death, but in a moment he recovered his self possession, and shook off the hold of the burglar with disgust.' `Yes, I know you!' he muttered through his teeth—`I know you too well, curse of my existence! what would you with me now?' `That your wife—' `Silence, villaiu!' interrupted Acton, fiercely. `Can I not see her?' demanded Gordon, nothing moved. `I would cut your throat first!' exclaimed Acton in a tone of terrible meaning. `I don't doubt it,' said Gordon, coolly. `I believe you love her—and if so, you would not have her detest you as you deserve' Before Gordon could finish his sentence, Acton, wrought to desperation, seized him by the throat and shook him fiercely. `Fiend!' he muttered, `you will tempt me to destroy you!' Gordon became black in the face before he could shake off his grasp; then pale as a corpse his eye flashed with suppressed rage, and his ashy lips quivered with passion. `Serpent!' he hissed through his set teeth, `I will be revenged on you for this! do you consider that I could make you detested of her?' `By —!' exclaimed Acton, `if you goad me thus, I shall be sure to kill you! Beware!' `Do you think I fear you? No, for I have you in my power! And it is to tell you this, that I am come—to torment you with fears lest Maria should discover—' Gordon knew not the desperation of the man he had to deal with, else he was foolishly rash. Acton's spirit was roused, he felt that the wretch before him had him in his power; that his character—his honor and his happiness were at his mercy. Could he —should he suffer such a man to live and be his curse? A terrible thought—a desperate purpose took possession of his soul. `By —, Kate,' whispered Joe, who had heard and seen all—`Murder will come of this—but keep back the dog!' Even as Joe spoke, Acton snatched a pistol from his pocket, and quick as thought presented it to Gordon's breast and fired. Gordon dashed it aside the moment it was discharged, and threw himself upon Acton, as if he would have crushed him. Down, they went, falling heavily to the ground; and the next moment Pluto, whom Kate could no longer control, burst away and `Like Mountain Cat that guards her young,' darted fiercely at his master's antagonist. His fangs were already at Gordon's throat, when Acton shouted to him to desist. The animal obeyed, and the two antagonists arose to their feet. Kate had taken advantage of the confu sion to fly to the house, but Joe still remained in his hiding place. `You would murder me, eh?' said Gordon, with a ghostly attempt at a laugh. `Ha! ha! that is a rich joke—but you shall pay for it, Acton, true as there is a devil in hell!' `A rich joke, indeed!' thought Joe, who was getting exceedingly nervous; `a devilish rich joke!' `Think you,' said Acton, that I can tamely submit to your insults, and that I can suffer to be tormented by you at your pleasure? By heavens! you do not know me!' `Nor do you know me;' retorted Gordon, `if you think that while you are rolling in riches and I am crushed by poverty—' `Ha?' cried Acton, his features brightening, `It is money you want!' `It is money I must have!' exclaimed Gordon. `How much, wretch! will buy you to secrecy?' demanded Acton, in a contemptuous tone. `Had you treated me as you would have treated an old friend,' replied Gordon, `I would have said five hundred—' `Five hundred!' `But as it is,' pursued Gordon, `I shall double that amount. One thousand dollars —not a penny less—will save you from dishonor.' `A rich joke indeed!' muttered Joe. `A cool thousand! Bravo, Gordon!' `Exorbitant!' exclaimed Mr. Acton. `Think of it!' said the burglar. `What is one thousand dollars to you? It will purchase you what nothing else can—security! The moment the money is in my hands, I promise never to trouble you again. Think of it!' `I will,' said Acton, `Come here day after to-morrow evening at ten o'clock, and I will give you an answer. Not before.' And before Gordon could arrest him, Mr. Acton followed by Pluto, hastened away in the direction of his house. CHAPTER V. Highway Robbery. GORDON watched the shadow of the retreating Acton for a moment, then, when it had disappeared with a light chuckle he himself turned to leave the spot. `There's a good seed planted,' he muttered to himself, rubbing his hands, `and if it don't grow to something handsome, it'll be owing to some accident; that's all. Ha, ha! a thousand dollars! To-morrow evening— no—the evening after, he said,—well, I shall be here, and be prepared too, for all his tricks and traps. A thousand! ha, ha!' `Ha, ha!' echoed a cautious laugh behind him; and at the same time there was a light touch upon his shoulder. `A cool thousand! ha. ha, ha!' Gordon wheeled about with a start, instinctively carrying his hand to his breast pocket—for what purpose the reader can imagine—and throwing himself into attitude of self-defence. `Light, Joe!' he exclaimed in surprise, `the devil!' “Light Joe and the devil!' exclaimed his companion,—`that is to say, you and I—for damme, Gordon, if you ain't a most accomplished child of Satan! A cool thousand! ha, ha! A rich joke, by my soul!' `Not bad, is it?' returned Gordon with a chuckle. `But how the devil does it happen that you are here?' Joe explained. `And you have overheard —' began Gordon. `Every word,' said Joe, `every word— seen the whole of the play from the first to the last.' `I hope not,' returned Gordon, with a grin. `You've only seen the second act. The first act was played a long time ago, and the best is yet to come.' `It's a deep tragedy, eh!' suggested Joe. `Very deep,' said Gordon. `Joe looked inquiringly at his companion, who shook his head significantly—as much as to say—`Deeper than you imagine.' `Tell me the first act,' said Joe, `I'll be secret, and perhaps can help you on your benefit night,' added he with a laugh. `My benefit night,—a good word! exclaimed Gordon. `You shall come in for a share then, Joe—but I declare I durst n't let you into the plot, and I be d— if I will!' Finding persuasion vain, Light Joe willingly changed the topic of conversation. He told Gordon of his interview with Kate, and they proceeded to mature their plans for the robbery of Mr. Acton's house as soon as they were sure of success. They had soon reached a retired spot on the road, when they paused. `It may be some time before these golden dreams are realized,' said Joe. `True, it may,' replied Gordon. `And we both want money.' `True, still!' `We ought to have some to-night.' `I'd be devilish glad of an opportunity to get some,' said Gordon. `Supposing then we try our hand—' `At what?' `At robbery!' Gordon looked at Joe, and Joe looked at Gordon again, as if they understood each other perfectly. `You're a rum chap, Joe!' exclaimed the old burglar; `bold as a tiger! I was just thinking of such a thing myself, but I was afraid you would decline, for it is ticklish business, robbing is—and we ain`t so much used to it as to another sort. But what do you say?' Joe made no reply, but producing a pistol went through with a little pantomime, which appeared quite picturesque in the moonlight, and pleased Gordon infinitely. It was a silent way of expressing the significant sentence—`Money or blood!' The two friends took another road, and proceeded still farther into the country. They chose a spot at a distance from any 2 house, where they could lie concealed in the shadow of a woody hill-side, and discover the approach of travellers in good season. It was a chilly night, but the robbers were warm-blooded and hardy to endure. They waited patiently for the approach of some traveller worthy their attention. Several passed them unmolested, for they were either too poor in appearance or too well attended to please the two adventurers. At last, a gentleman, alone on horseback, came riding by. The moonlight streamed full upon the face and person of the traveller, at sight of whom the robbers promised themselves a rich if not an easy prey. His dress was plain but costly; and this, to the adventurers, was a surer indication that he carried money in his pocket, than the most extravagant foppery and display. In appearance the traveller was dignified, easy, deliberate and firm. A dark complexion, handsome features—the most remarkable of which was his black, piercing eye—a strong, well-proportioned frame, a well trimmed but heavy mustache of the same color, and a profusion of raven locks that shaded his broad, intellectual forehead, made up the striking exterior of the traveller's person. Such was the individual who was riding deliberately along towards Boston, when suddenly two men sprang up before him, like two tigers eager for their prey. The horse was a powerful animal, and he reared violently, but Light Joe seized him by the bridle and held him fast. The traveller, calm and self-possessed, put spurs to his horse, at the same time levelling a pistol at Joe's head. The young robber would probably have then met with a most tragical end, had not Gordon, springing to the other side of the horse, seized the traveller unawares, and dragged him forcibly to the ground. `A word and you die!' muttered Gordon, planting his knee upon the traveller's breast. `Give us your money, and you can go your way. Be quick!' The fallen man made no reply, but with a sudden and most powerful effort, turned upon his side, and threw the robber, who was wholly unprepared for such a movement, directly over his head. At that moment Light Joe loosed his hold of the frightened horse, then, as the traveller's hand was raised to deal Gordon a blow with the stock of his pistol, he leaped upon him from behind, striking him with a slung shot. The blow did little execution, and before the young robber could repeat it, he was thrown violently to the ground, and the traveller's fingers were at his throat and his knees upon his breast. As if careless of his own life while he took vengeance on Joe, the traveller struck him twice on the head, regardless of Gordon who came to the rescue. There was a flash of bright steel in the moonlight, and Gordon's knife was buried in the traveller's side. It was the work of desperation, for there was a fourth individual hastening to the scene of the struggle. The traveller's hold relaxed, and Joe rose heavily to his feet while his companion kept the new comer at bay. This last individual was unarmed, but with a strong hand he seized Gordon's wrist and pushed him backwards. Seeing that Joe was fairly on his feet and recovered from the shock he had suffered, Gordon suddenly wrenched away the grasp of the fresh comer, and escaped with his companion. `Tear open my vest,' said the wounded man to his deliverer. `I have a cut in my side which bleeds profusely.' The traveller was seriously wounded, but his voice was as calm as if he had merely received a rent in his dress, or a scratch upon his hand. He sat upon the ground while the other hastened to stanch the blood that flowed from his side, with his handkerchief. `Shall I cry for assistance?' asked the young man; `or do you think you could walk a short distance with my help alone I live not more than sixty rods farther on— and there is where you must go, or be taken, added the youth. `I can walk,' said the traveller, gaining his feet. `Give me your arm and I will try to get along. You are very kind.' `Did the robber strike you more than once?' asked the young man. `Thanks to you, I got but one stab,' replied the traveller. `Did you see what became of my horse?' `He dashed by me like the wind,' said the other. `I thought there was foul play somewhere, and ran on to have a share in it.' Thus the two continued to converse as they proceeded on their way. The traveller leaned heavily on the young man's arm, but he uttered not a word of complaint, although ready to faint at every step. They arrived in the course of a few minutes in front of a small, neat white cottage, which the young man said was his home. He assisted the wounded traveller along the gravelled walk by which it was approached, and led, or rather carried him to the door. The traveller fainted on the threshold. `Quick with a light, mother!' cried the young man. Startled by her son's agitated tones, a middle aged lady flew to the door. `What is the matter, Frederic?' she cried in alarm. The light fell upon the form of the traveller, whom the young man held in his arms, and she started back with a suppressed cry. `What have you there? `A traveller,' replied Frederic, `who had been wounded by robbers. Throw open the door.' The woman complied, and lifting the stranger in his arms, the young man carried him to an apartment in the house and placed him n a bed. In a short time they succeeded in restoring him to consciousness, and Fred ric, who happened to be a young practitioner of the medical art, proceeded at once to dress his wounds. Frederic Farley was a pale, noble looking young man, with light blue eyes, light hair, handsome and finely moulded features, and a slight but athletic form. He was naturally excitable and impulsive, but possessed of sufficient self-command to govern his feelings on most occasions. Although scarce five-and-twenty years of age, he had already graduated at two colleges, and commenced the practice of his profession. Yet he was poor, his new business being barely sufficient to support himself and mother in their humble country residence. Mrs. Farley was a widow, whose greatest fault was her pride; not pride in worldly goods, not pride in her own qualities, not pride of rank or faith, but pride in the only being she loved on earth—her son. In her blind devotion to him, she could not see a fault in his character, nor believe but that he approached as near perfection as it is possible for mortals to do. Yet maternal tenderness did not banish other feelings from her nature, for she had the reputation of being one of the most benevolent, kind, simple-hearted creatures that heaven ever placed on earth as a contrast to its coldness, selfishness and deceit. It was into such hands that the wounded traveller had fortunately fallen; and such were the two individuals who devoted their cares and labors to relieve a stranger's pain and to promote a stranger's comfort, as if he had been an old and dearly beloved friend. CHAPTER VI. Who is the Stranger? THE traveller was dangerously wounded, yet Frederic Farley had no doubts of his recovery. `You must be quiet,' said the young practitioner, `else the consequence of your misfortune may be more serious than we imagine.' `I put myself under your charge,' said the traveller; `do with me as you like.' He had seen enough of Frederic to be convinced of his skill and judgment, and to feel perfectly safe in his hands. The young man colored slightly at the compliment, and warned the stranger not to place such reliance in his science as to think no care was to be taken on his own part, during his confinement from his wound. After Frederic had made every necessary arrangement for the comfort of his guest, the latter begged of him one more favor. `If it is not asking too much'—said the traveller. `Do not fear,' returned Frederic, `I am ready to do anything for you in my power.' `I reside for the present in Boston,' said the traveller, `and would like to send there to-night. Will you allow me to write a letter?' he asked with a smile. `Indeed!' `Only three lines,' pursued the traveller. Frederic brought a desk to the stranger's bedside, and placed paper, pens and ink before him. With an effort so strong that the young doctor was alarmed, the wounded man laid his right hand upon the desk and took the pen. He wrote no more than a dozen words, then, having signed his name he requested Frederic to fold the latter. `You can look at the signature,' said the traveller. Frederic glanced at the page, which he perceived was written in French, and ran his eye along to the signature.— `Gustavus Burnam.' It was the name of one Frederic already knew by reputation, but whom he had never seen before; and he could scarcely realize that the fortunate adventurer who had lately arrived at Boston, and was creating such a sensation in the first society of that sober town, was the inmate of his humble cottage. `Gustavus Barnum!' he repeated, glancing in surprise at his guest then turning his eye upon the name again, `Am I mistaken? You are the Barnum who has excited the curiosity and wonder of the Yankees to a degree—' `You flatter me,' interrupted the stranger. `There was some talk about me, it is true, when I first arrived, but it was only because the good people of Boston wanted something to talk about. But that is all over with now.' `Not quite, I should judge,' returned Frederic, smiling, `for it was only yesterday that I saw an article in one of the papers which dwelt upon the originality and independence of character of the princely Gustavus Barnum.' `All folly,' said Barnum with a smile. `Because I am not like most people—but a little eccentric perhaps—there are those foolish enough to speculate about me, and look upon my plain, straight forward course of life as mysterious. It's all folly. Will you have the goodness to pass me a pen?' And Barnum with the greatest sang froid imaginable, superscribed the letter. Frederic had folded and handed it him again. `If you can find a man to carry that to its address to night,' said he, `I will reward him handsomely and be obliged to you.” Frederic, after calling his mother and giving her a formal introduction to his guest, left the house to send the letter to its address. Mrs. Farley felt highly gratified to think that her humble cottage was honored with the presence of so remarkable an individual, and her motherly pride was flattered to have that individual an acquaintance and a patient of her, son. Then how her eye sparkled with delight, when she heard Burnam speak of Frederick in terms of commendation and respect! `Oh! you do not know him yet!' she exclaimed. `I am his mother, and may be deceived,'—she had not the least idea that she was, however—`but I am sure you must like him better as you become acquainted with him. He is too generous; that's his greatest fault.' `An amiable fault,' said Burnam, `if it is one.' `He will never allow that he is so himself,' pursued Mrs. Farley; and she added, with a smile of pride, `but you shall judge for yourself, Mr. Burnam.' At a glance Burnam read the character of the lady before him, and saw her in all her motherly vanity, simplicity, and kindness of heart, as plainly as if he had known her for years. In a short time Frederick returned, and his mother left the room. `Mr. Farley,' said Burnam, `if I have been rightly informed, there is a Mr. Acton living at no great distance from here.' `Henry P. Acton—' `The same. I have heard of him, and would like to know him. Although I don't want it to get noised about that I am here, if you could manage to induce Mr. Acton— with whom you are acquainted, of course—' `Certainly' `If you can induce him to call here and see a wounded traveler—you understand— you would do me a great favor.' `There would not be the least difficulty in doing so—or even in getting the whole neighborhood to flock here, if I were to mention your name.' `That would be the trouble—the whole neighborhood! You see, I want nobody but Mr. Acton, and him at all hazards. I hear he has a beautiful wife?' The features of the wounded man, usually so stoical and firm, expressed uncommon interest as Frederick was about to reply, and his keen eye was fixed upon the young man's face as if it would have read his heart. `His wife is a most amiable woman,' said Frederick. `Did you ever hear her maiden name?' pursued Burnam. `Maria Irving, I believe,' replied the other. Burnam's features betrayed no emotion— but his heart beat quicker than usual. `Has she children?' `A son—an only child.' `Or other relations?' `A sister, named Edith.' `She is young, is she not?' `About eighteen.' `And beautiful?' Frederick blushed as he replied, that she was very fair. He seemed to know that his patient could read his thoughts, and blushed more deeply still. Upon which, he warned Burnam not to over-exert himself talking, and politely declined answering more questions. `You should go to sleep,' said he. `As I am to follow your directions scrupulously, I shall do so,' said his patient. He closed his eyes, and in less than two minutes, Frederick had reason to believe he was sleeping soundly. Early on the following morning, a young man appeared at the cottage, and inquired for Mr. Burnam. He was a shrewd, active, intelligent individual, who spoke with a French accent, and with a plentiful sprinkling of French words and idioms in his imperfect English. `I be his valet de chambre,' said he to Frederick. `He send for me last night, and I come for see him.' Frederick spoke to his patient, and told him of his visitor. `Ah! it is Louis, my man,' said Burnam. `Show him in.' Louis entered the house, but never removed his hat until he came into the presence of his master. Their conversation was brief, and in the French tongue, which Burnam spoke fluently. Louis heard his master's orders with the most respectful attention, and bowing low as when he entered, took his leave. Shortly after this, Frederick left home, and did not return again until noon. But Burnam, during this time, was not alone.— Mrs. Farley had been with him a portion of the time, and about eleven o'clock he received a visitor. This was Mr. Acton. Burnam, who was sitting in an easy chair, at a window, when he entered, raised his black, piercing eyes to his face, and in a moment had scanned him from head to foot. Mrs. Farley gave the two individuals an introduction to each other, and mutual compliments passed between them. Burnam was very pale—more so, indeed, than before his visitor entered—but he betrayed no agitation. `I am sorry for your misfortune,' said Mr. Acton, `although it is owing to it that I have the pleasure of making your acquaintance. How many robbers attacked you?' `Two,' replied Burnam. And at Mr. Acton's request, he went on to describe the robbers so minutely, that his visitor, while he was astonished at his powers of observation, was satisfied that one of the highwayman was Gordon. `Would the wretch had been killed!' tho't he. `It would be one adder removed from my path; but as it is, there is not only danger of being robbed by him myself, but of having my character ruined through his treachery. One, you say, was quite young?' he added, speaking aloud. `I should judge him to be but little more than twenty.' `An accomplice!' thought Mr. Acton.— `Heaven grant that he knows nothing of the secret!' Mr. Acton spent nearly an hour with his new acquaintance, who exerted himself to his utmost, without appearing to do so, however, to please his visitor. In this, Burnam succeeded so well that Mr. Acton was quite fascinated, deeming him the most extraordinary man he ever knew, and feeling much flattered by the attentions and familiarity of so remarkable an individual. When they parted, Mr. Burnam urged his visitor to call on him again that day, if possible; which Mr. Acton promised to do. No less than three times during the day, was the sick man waited on by Louis, his valet de chambre, who never remained with him more than ten minutes at a visit. Towards evening, Mr. Acton again appeared, and once more gave himself up to the fascinating conversation of his new acquaintance. Burnam seemed to have read him thoroughly, and to know precisely how to interest, flatter, and please him. In the course of their conversation, the sick man skilfully alluded to Mr. Acton's family, and without appearing at all anxious or interested in learning particulars about them, induced his visitor to dwell upon his domestic affairs until he had discovered all he wished to know. Little, indeed, did Mr. Acton imagine that every word he uttered—aye, his every look and action—was listened to, and watched, with eager interest by his new acquaintance, and weighed and noted down in his heart among the things to be remembered. Truly, that Burnam was a strange and extraordinary man! CHAPTER VII. Discoveries. IT WAS natural that Mr. Acton should converse with his wife about the distinguished stranger whose acquaintance he had made, and it is by no means to be wondered at that, knowing her husband's character as she did, she should be surprised at the influence Burnam already began to exert over him, and should feel a lively curiosity to see that remarkable individual. Both she and her sister Edith were deeply interested in his account of Mr. Burnam, and compared it with sketches of him which they had seen in the Boston papers. Mrs. Acton had observed that her husband, since his interview with Gordon, of which she had not the slightest suspicion, had been frequently lost in thought, and wholly absorbed by dark reflections; and, hoping to restore his spirits, she encouraged his acquaintance with Mr. Burnam, whose society was so fascinating and enlivening. On the following day Mr. Acton visited his new friend, but he spent a greater part of it in Boston. In the evening, true to his appointment with Gordon, he was early at the place of rendezvous, awaiting the burglar's arrival. It was a pleasant night, although frequent clouds obscured the moon, and cast their dark shadows along the earth. Mr. Acton walked impatiently to and fro, for Gordon did not appear at the hour.— Soon, however, a dark figure might have been seen among the trees, stealing towards the spot; and the next moment Acton and his evil genius stood face to face. `You've come at last,' said Acton, gruffly' `When you play such stupendous games as that, one would suppose you would be more prompt.' `Are you in a hurry to hand over that snug little bribe?' asked Gordon, with a sneer. `I had a good will not to come here at all,' said Acton, abruptly. `Do you know what I would have done if you hadn't?' asked Gordon, with a grin. `Well?' `I should have presented myself to your wife!' Mr. Acton turned upon his tormentor so fiercely, and with a look of such terrible passion, that the villain instinctivey started back and raised his hand, as if to ward an expected blow. `Fear not,' said Acton, through his teeth, and in a tone of bitter irony; `I can bear your taunts—anything! I cannot resent them! Oh! go on—there is no danger!' Gordon did not go on, however, for the strange manner of his companion made him shiver with fear and dread. He saw how desperate he had made his victim, and felt sure that he would as soon take his life as bear another taunt. `Why should we be enemies?' he asked. `We were once friends.' `Friends! friends!' echoed the other, with a scornful, bitter laugh; `ha! ha!' `At least,' pursued Gordon, `we were not at open enmity, and interest kept us together.' `That time,' said Acton, `is at an end.— We both profited by our former connection, and you now come down on me as if I alone had been benefited, and that at your expense.' `Did you not gain by it more than I?' demanded Gordon. `Was it not through me that you won—' The burglar checked himself, for Mr. Acton turned upon him again so fiercely, that he dare not utter the word that trembled on his tongue. `You think,' said Mr. Acton; `indeed you said, that you have me in your power, and that I dare not resent your insults. I tell you I dare, and that you are in my power rather than I in yours. How easy would it be for me to shut you up in prison!' `You!' `For the affair of night before last. There was a robbery—or, rather, an attempt—' `Where?' interrupted Gordon, turning pale. `You need not pretend ignorance, for I have proof you have no suspicion of. You are the man who wounded Mr. Burnam.— Don't attempt to deny it, for I know it. But deal honorably with me and I will not expose you. Answer me this question: are you not a robber by profession?' `A devil, perhaps,' replied Gordon; `but that is nothing here nor there. You dare not expose me, for you know my spirit.— But let us be friends; the world has dealt better by you than by me, and now that I am poor, it is no more than right that you should help me. Give me one thousand dollars, and you shall never hear from me, or be troubled by me again.' `So you said twelve years ago,' returned Mr. Acton. `But you have spent the money I gave you then, and now you must have more; and so it will be in ten years hence if I give you money now. How do I know when I am safe? What reliance can I place on your word?' `I swear that I will never ask you for money again; and I never even promised you this before. I pledged myself never to return to you where you then lived, and that was all. Now I swear never to demand anything of you again, provided you grant me this.' Mr. Acton looked the robber full in the face, as if with those keen, flashing eyes of his, he would have pierced his soul. `Can I trust you?' he demanded, looking as if he would murder him if he lied. `Yes,' answered Gordon, firmly. `Then take this,' said Mr. Acton, putting a package into his hand, `and remember well what I tell you. If you ever cross my path again in any way like this, I will kill you as if you were a serpent or a dog!' The two parted; not with friendly adieus, but with curses on each other. Gordon clutched the package with a grin of triumph, and slunk away, glancing behind him, as if he feared Acton would anticipate his perjury, and carry his last words into execution. With a heart filled with bitterness and self-reproach, Acton strode back towards his house, his hands clenched, and his teeth pressed angrily against his bloody lips. He was goaded to desperation. Gordon, fearing lest Acton was not alone in being convinced of his guilt, and nervously anxious to get off with his prize, hastened back to Boston. Not a little excited by imaginary fears, he did not take a stage, deeming it unsafe to come in contact with more than one man at a time, but walked or ran the whole distance to his house in Centre street. A dark figure had followed Gordon all the way from Acton's house to his own miserable abode, sometimes near, and sometimes at a distance, but always keeping him in sight; and now, while the burglar was eagerly tearing open the package he had received of Acton, anxious to know that there was no deception, that dark figure turned upon its heel and hurried back by the road it came. Once more in the country, it passed by Acton's house again, and by the very spot where the interview we have described took place, then hurrying onward still, arrived at the door of Frederick Farley's house. A minute after, that figure was alone with Gustavus Burnam in his apartment. `Louis!' exclaimed Mr. Burnam, his eye brightening; `you have brought good news —let me hear it quickly.' In the dark, mysterious visage that was revealed to Burnam in the light of a lamp that burned dimly upon the table, no stranger could have read a single thought, or divined from the expression there whether it had feelings of triumph or despair; but Burnam's penetrating eye discovered at a glance that his servant was the bearer of good tidings. `I have seen a strange sight,' said Louis, speaking in French—which we give in our own English, not such as he would have used. `A strange sight, eh?' said Burnam, in the same tongue. `What was it?' `Le diable m'importe si je sais,' replied the valet de chambre—`the devil may take me if I know—but I will describe it to you. Monsieur, and perhaps you can understand it. I kept watch as you ordered—' `Yes—' `And followed Acton after I saw him go out. He met another man in the orchard and I overheard what was said, and saw all that passed. I have found out who robbed you night before last, and have learned where one of the villains lives.' And at the request of his master, who listened to him with deep interest, Louis went on to relate all he had seen and heard, comprising nearly all that passed between Mr. Acton and the burglar. The intelligence was of more importance even than Louis had anticipated. It mattered very little with Burnam that he knew who had attempted to rob him, but having learned that there was some mysterious connection between that individual and Mr. Acton, he could not conceal his satisfaction. `Tu as bien fait, Louis,' said he. `You have done well. And now, if you will find out who this robber is—for it is probable Acton was right in charging him with being such—if you will find out who he is, and bring him in contact with me at some convenient time, you will complete your good work. If he is the man I suspect him to be, judging from his conversation with Acton, your discovery will be worth more to me than any gold. Now leave me, for it is getting late. Take good care of my apartments in Boston, for I shall return to them soon. I do not say this because I have ever found you neglectful, but because your zeal in my private business might cause you to neglect matters of less importance. You have done well, Louis, you can go.' The valet de chambre bowed and withdrew. There was no smile upon his face, nor look of triumph in his dark eye; but in his heart he felt more joy at the praise bestowed upon him by the master whom he loved, than the adulations of thousands could have caused. After he was gone, Gustavus Burnam sat for half an hour in his easy chair, his hands crossed upon his breast, his eyes closed, and his whole frame as motionless as if he was enwrapped in a deep sleep. At the end of that time he started up, exclaiming with more impatience than was his wont:— `Would this wound were cured, for I long to fathom this mystery! Yet it is owing to the wound that I have discovered what I have, and I ought rather to bless the accident than curse my fortune. Henry Acton —Maria Irving—the day of retribution is at hand!' CHAPTER VIII. The Test. The following day was warm and pleasant, and Gustavus Burnam, for the first time since his wound, walked out into the open air, leaning upon Frederick's arm. Without any previously expressed intention, both, as if with one accord, directed their steps towards Mr. Acton's house. Burnam had already learned that Frederick loved Edith Irving, and Mrs. Farley had informed him that that lady was so blind to exellence as to show a preference for the Rev. Mr. Everett. Burnam saw how matters stood at once; both the clergyman and doctor would gladly have won Miss Edith, but the former having been first and longest at the siege, had made the greatest impression on the citadel of her affections. She liked them both, but if either had her love, it was the preacher. It so happened that Burnam and the young physician met Everett at the house of Mr. Acton. Edith and these three gentlemen were at first alone together, and Burnam had an opportunity of studying the characters of the young lady and the two suitors, and of comparing those of the young men. He was not mistaken in the high opinion he had formed of Edith, but found her an admirable woman in every sense of the term. With regard to Frederick, he liked him the better the more he saw of him, and never had he seen him to better advantage than in the presence of her he loved. The clergyman was intellectual, brilliant in conversation, and easy in address; but Burnam, after contemplating him long, set it down in his mind that learned though he was, and good though he appeared, he wanted the noble qualities of his rival, and was less worthy than he to be her accepted suitor. In a short time Mr. Acton entered with his wife, and introduced her to the distinguished stranger. Why was Burnam, who possessed such self-command, so agitated then?' None remarked his emotion, for, although he was very pale, that fact was attributed to his recent wound. In a short time Burnam had recovered his self-possession, and then he became the life of the company. His conversation was varied and easy, his wit brilliant, and his reflection deep. He was near thirty-five years of age, and a good portion of his life had been spent in foreign lands, where he had gathered a rich store of useful and entertaining knowledge. Mrs. Acton and her sister listened to his words enraptured; Mr. Acton and Frederick, as they had always done since they had made his acquaintance; and even the Rev. Mr. Everett was obliged to acknowledge the superior intellect and extraordinary powers of the fascinating stranger. Burnam and Frederick Farley remained only an hour at Mr. Acton's, but during that short space of time the former had seen more and reflected more than most men would have done in years! On the following morning Burnam visited the Actons again, unaccompanied by Frederick, and in the afternoon Louis, his valet de chambre, came for him in a carriage, and he returned to Boston. At his hotel, he found his apartments in order, Louis having made sumptuous arrangements for the comfort of his master.— The faithful servant was again rewarded by the brief but cheering words which sounded so sweetly to his ears when uttered by Mr. Burnam— `Tu as bien fait—you have done well!' Burnam's apartments were of an extraordinary character. In his library were books of every description; grave and gay; scientific and polite; historical and fictitious; in many languages. And Burnam understood them all. In his cabinet were curiosities from almost every quarter of the globe; natural and artificial; rude creations of savages— together with the most exquisite works of art; old swords of curious workmanship, and slender rapiers; delicate silettoes and rude bowie-knives; rifles, pistols, and other weapons of defence. During his master's absence Louis had neglected nothing, but had kept his wardrobe as free from dust, the ottomans as scrupulously clean, and every piece of silver or steel as bright as if Burnam had been ever there to overlook his work. `You have done well,' repeated Burnam, reclining amid the luxuries of his apartments. `And now for the private matters I have entrusted to your charge. I must know whether this Gordon is indeed the man I suspect him to be. There is one way of ascertaining; can you be my agent in this also?' `I will try to serve you,' said Louis. `One word,' pursued Burnam, `spoken in the hearing of this Gordon, will give the information I desire. It is a single name.— If he starts at it, or betrays any emotion, he is the individual I suspect. If, on the other hand, he hears it as he would any other name, with no emotion, I am wrong.— You must repeat it in his hearing, Louis, and report to me the effect it produces.' The valet bowed, and waited for his master to proceed. Burnam then taught him to pronounce a single word—a name—which the Frenchman soon learned to speak as distinctly as any in his own tongue. `Now go, Louis,' said his master, `and be cautious.' From the luxury and splendor of Burnam's residence we must now descend to one of the lowest haunts in Boston—a grog-shop in Ann street. It was evening, and there was a goodly company assembled in a low but spacious room, which offered convenience for drinking, dancing, and carousing. The walls were smoky and disfigured, the windows covered with dust which supplied the want of curtains, and the floor exceedingly rough and dirty, except in such places as had been worn smooth by `hornpipes,' `pigeon-wings,' and `double shuffles.' The proprietor of this respectable establishment was the fat, red faced, coarse looking gentleman who stood in the bar dealing out `drinks,' and eyeing his customers with his bloodshot orbs of vision as the serpent watches its prey. The principal man in the room, the venerable landlord excepted, was an old acquaintance of the reader. Gordon had money, and felt its value. Instead of using the sum he had extorted from Mr. Acton to some good purpose, or reforming and engaging in some respectable business, the grovelling wretch only became the more degraded by its possession. He was not miserly, yet he had ever concealed from Mag Munson the fact that he had money, and kept it carefully hid in a snug corner at home. He used it freely, however, to the glory of himself, and the infinite gratification of his low companions. On the evening in question he had been drinking with his old associates, and treating them until there were but few individuals in the room who could conscientiously be called sober. Joe was Gordon's favored friend, for he had kept his secret, and had not asked to share his money; yet Joe was cautious, and although repeatedly urged to drink, he scrupulously kept within the bounds of sobriety. He, too, had a part to play. There were two other sober individuals in that gay company, who deserve the attention of the reader. The most remarkable of these was a young man who seemed made for better society. There were no marks of dissipation on his countenance, and his dress was in some measure superior to that of his companions. He wore heavy black whiskers, and hair that quite conccaled his intellectual brow; and his keen eyes were disguised by green glasses. This individual had the reputation of being a `good fellow,' although a `hard nut,' and of having `seen a thing or two' in the world. His name was Marvin, and he it was who had the satisfaction of knowing that he had been the means of Kate Munson's ruin. He had evidently seen good society, but had either been expelled from respectable circles, or sought the company of the vicious for variety, and from choice. The other individual we mentioned as being sober, was none other than Louis, Burnam's valet de chambre. He was sitting on a low bench by the stove, looking about with an air of reckless listlessness, as if he were one of the company; but he was in fact disgusted with the scene, and instead of gazing around him with no object, he was watching with a penetrating eye the actions of Gordon and his associates. Louis had been sitting on the bench alone for some minutes, when Light Joe and Marvin, the man in the green glasses, came and sat down immedtately in front of him. `Where is Kate, now?' asked Marvin.— `Have you seen her lately?' `Why do you ask about her?' returned Joe, sullenly. `You care nothing about her.' `Oh, of course not,' said the other; `I have given up my claims to you. Only, as an old friend, I'd like to know where she is.' `Well,' said Joe, `I suppose there can be no harm in telling you. You won't mention it, I'm sure.' Joe said something in a low tone, of which Louis could distinguish only one word—`Acton'—at which he started, and leaned forward, in order to hear more distinctly. `The fact of it is,' said Joe, `Kate is going to reform;' and as he spoke he looked Marvin full in the face, watching the expression of his features with an eagle eye; `she is really going to reform. Then you see, when she gets to be a good respectable girl, I shall adopt some sober profession— the pulpit, perhaps—and marry her. What d'ye think of that, eh? How would it sound —the Rev. Joe Jenks and lady? or, perhaps, I'd change my name, and be called—' The next word Joe whispered in Marvin's ear. What it was Louis could not tell, but it was doubtless something potent, for the man in the green glasses started as if a dagger had pierced him, giving Joe a look like that of a wounded snake. That look was full of surprise, hatred, and revenge. `What do you mean?' he asked in a moment, having recovered his self-possession. `Nothing in particular, of course,' replied Joe, whittling a stick with his knife. `Wouldn't that sound well? What do you think?' `I must postpone my answer until another time,' replied Marvin, looking meaningly at Joe. `I shall see you soon and have a talk with you. Meanwhile, let me say if you do get to be a minister, don't forget me, your old friend.' This was uttered in such a light tone that Louis was thrown off his guard, and felt that his first suspicions must have been without foundation. At that moment Gordon came that way, to the great relief of Joe, who felt that he was getting in deep water, and urged the whole company to `step up and drink.' `Plenty of money!' he exclaimed, jingling some silver in his pockets—`good liquor—good company—hurrah!' Thus the inebriated fellow ran on, wild with artificial joy, until, above his own voice and the confused sounds about him, there arose a full, deep ominous voice, that pronounced a single word. In an instant Gordon's joy was turned to terror. He looked about him, shivering with dread, his eyes starting from their sockets, and his countenance deathly pale.— Nobody seemed to have heard that voice except himself, and none present to have given utterance to that terrible word. Yet he heard it plainly as if he himself had spoken it, and could not be deceived. Could it be that there was something supernatural in it—that it was a warning, which Heaven intended should recal to his startled soul all his dark career of crime and its fearful close? CHAPTER IX. `The Root of all Evil.' GORDON sank upon the bench by the side of Louis, who alone of the entire company knew the cause of the sudden change in the drunken man. Half an hour afterwards, Louis was in the presence of his master. `I have succeeded,' said he, bluntly, without the slightest expression of triumph on his face. `You spoke the word?' cried Burnam, eagerly. `Yes.' `And the effect?' `One would have thought,' said Louis, `that poison was mixed with the liquor he had quaffed, and that the consequences were sudden and fatal.' `Louis!' `Monsieur, he staggered like an ox that the butcher strikes suddenly dead,' pursued the valet. `I left him on the bench which received his weight as he fell.' `Louis!' said Burnam, his eyes flashing with joy, `you have served me well. This knowledge, which I owe to you, affords me greater satisfaction than untold sums of gold could do. Now all that remains for you to accomplish, is to bring about an interview between me and this Gordon, whom I must see face to face.' `That I will endeavor to do, Monsieur.' `Then success is certain, Louis,' said his master. `You are a host.' When the valet had retired, Burnam paced his room with rapid strides. `Oh! I will clear up this mystery!' he said—`then let the guilty beware!' Let us return to Gordon and his companions. For a moment the burglar lay upon the low bench upon which he had fallen, in a state of bewilderment, for the voice which pronounced the fatal word seemed to have come from Heaven. He was aroused by the landlord—if the proprietor of such a grog-shop merits the appellation—who struck him rudely upon the shoulder. `Come Gordon, what ails ye?' said the red faced man. `You're as white as a toadstool! and I'll be d—d if you doesn't tremble! You hain't seen a ghost, hey?' Gordon grasped his arm, and pulling him eagerly towards him, whispered in his ear: `You haven't seen one?' `Ha! ha! no! I doesn't deal in them animals.' `Nor heard one?' pursued Gordon, eagerly. `What the devil d'ye mean?' cried the bloated man, contemptuously. `Do you mean to insult my honor by hintin' that I keeps ghosts? D—n me if this hain't too respectable an establishment for them 'ere critters to ha'nt. But you're gassin' old cock.' `No,' said Gordon, `I feel sick.' `Wall, that sounds better—that does.— D'ye know what'll cure ye? A horn of brandy, Gordon; a horn—a good stiff horn —nothin' better.' Gordon, now thinking the terrible word he had heard was in his own imagination, concluded to follow the red faced man's advice, and stepped up to the bar to drink. Meanwhile, in a retired corner of the establishment, two individuals were conver sing in a low tone. They were Marvin and Light Joe. `It is not for myself I ask it,' said Joe, `but for her. You have been her ruin, and it is no more than just that you should make some amends. And this you must do! I have taken her under my protection, and I shall see that you do right by her. Give me two hundred dollars for her, or give it to her yourself, and we will never trouble you more. Refuse at your peril!' `But I have not that sum with me,' said the man in green glasses. `Only give me time—' `You can get the money easy enough,' interrupted Joe, `and you must.' `When?' `Before to-morrow night.' `True as Heaven, I cannot!' `So much the worse for you then!' exclaimed Joe, `for mine is no idle threat!' Marvin bit his lips in perplexity. `One word more,' pursued Joe, buttoning his coat and pulling his cap over his face. `Well.' `I want you to understand that she has nothing to do with this; and that if you attempt to injure her in any way, it will be ten times worse for you.' So saying, Joe left the house. `The devil is against me!' exclaimed the man in green glasses. `Would I had killed the girl a month ago! That would have saved me from—ruin! That d—d Joe will be sure to keep his word, unless I get him the money. How shall I raise it? Ah! I have it! Gordon has gold, and he is just drunk enough to be desperate. I must win of him.' Gordon was talking with the bloated proprietor of the establishment, across the greasy counter. Marvin touched him on the shoulder, and whispered in his ear. `To be sure I will!' exclaimed Gordon. `Ninepence the stake, did you say? I can play higher than that, if you like.' `Come on then,' said Marvin. Five minutes after, the two were seated at a small table in one corner, placed there expressly for the accommodation of those who chose to play at cards for small stakes, or shake the dice-box. `What will you play for?' asked Marvin, shuffling the cards. `For what you please,' replied Gordon, with an air of recklessness. Marvin laid down twenty-five cents. The cards were dealt, they played, and Gordon won. Upon which, the latter proposed to double the stakes, to which his opponent agreed. This time Marvin won, and offered to bet a dollar on the next game. At the end of half an hour the two stood precisely as they did at the commencement, but Marvin had succeeded in exciting his opponent, and the stake had been raised to five dollars. That being rather higher playing than the frequenters of this respectable establishment were accustomed to witnessing, the whole company crowded eagerly about the players, watching the game with interest, and casting avaricious glances at the money. For some time the play went on with nearly equal success, but at last Marvin began to win, and in playing six games took fifty dollars. Gordon's face was flushed, his eyes twinkled with excitement, and his fingers trembled. He laid down ten dollars—it was the last he had about him—and Marvin placed ten beside it. The cards ran even, and the players held nearly equal hands. The stake depended upon the last trick that was taken. Gordon played the king of trumps, and from the way his opponent had played, he made sure that he would not go above it, but he was mistaken; Marvin threw down the ace. With an oath Gordon sprang from his seat. `Stop here till I come back,' he whis pered in Marvin's ear. `I will win back what I have lost, or I will lose more!' `Very well.' And Marvin quietly gathered up his money, while Gordon rushed from the room. It took the burglar but a minute to reach his residence on Centre street, where he found Mag Munson alone. He threw down twelve and a half cents upon the table, and ordered her to go out and buy a bottle of whiskey. She saw that all was not right with him, and at first refused to go, but he uttered such a terrible threat, and appeared so desperate and resolved, that she took the bottle and left the room. This was all Gordon wanted. He hastily moved the cupboard from its place against the wall, pried off with the shovel a portion of the wainscoting, and took from behind it a compact bundle. This he undid, put about half the contents in his pocket, and returning the remainder to the crevice from which he had taken it, nailed up the wainscot again, and put the cupboard in its place. All this time there was a pair of glaring eyes in the dark passage beyond the door, watching eagerly the movements of the burglar. No sooner had Gordon replaced the wainscot and the cupboard than those red eyes disappeared, and a dark figure glided down the stairs. It was Mag Munson. Gordon hastened back to the spot where he had left Marvin. He found his opponent waiting, and soon the play went on again as before. And once more the burglar's brain was lost in a whirlwind of excitement, of eager hope and nervous fear, of alternate triumph and despair; and once more the spectators crowded about him, watching the game as closely as if they too were concerned in the result. Gordon lost—lost—lost! `Shall we go on, or stop?' Marvin would occasionally say, as he coolly added his winnings to his increasing pile of money. `Go on! go on!' the infatuated man would exclaim. `It is all luck—every bit of it—it will be my turn soon!' But his turn never came! In an hour the man in green glasses had won from him more than three hundred dollars. Gordon had but fifteen dollars remaining in his pocket, and this he dashed upon the table in a fit of desperation. He dealt the cards himself, and caught them up eagerly to see if his luck had changed. A quiet smile passed over the features of the man in the green glasses as he looked at his cards, while Gordon dashed his upon the table with an oath of rage. `The money is yours,' said he, `but you have cheated.' `I have played fair,' said his opponent, coolly. `You lie!' thundered Gordon with a fierce oath, shaking his fist at Marvin. No sooner had he spoken than the man in glasses was upon his feet, and laid Gordon prostrate on the floor. He struck him down as easily as if he had been a tottering child. Stung to madness by the pain occasioned by the blow, the burglar got up as soon as he conveniently could in the scattered state of his senses, and reeled towards his opponent. The latter, having secured the money so that the spectators could not easily snatch it from him, in case there should be a row, coolly folded his arms awaiting his approach. `For shame!' cried the gentlemanly proprietor of the shop. `This is too bad!— What! a fight in my respectable establishment! Who'd ha' tho't it? No, no! 'twon't do, no how!' With these words, the red faced man caught Gordon's arms, and restrained him from doing further damage to the reputation of his house—and the person of the man in glasses. The burglar saw his error in a moment, and instead of making any hostile demonstration towards his opponent, defied him to await his return and play with him again— adding fiercely that he would lose all, or win all back once more. Once more he entered his abode in Centre street, and found Mag there again alone. He cared not now if she did discover the place where his money was concealed, for it was his intention to take the last dollar. Mag was sitting by the cupboard. `Get away!' he muttered, fiercely. His brow was black, his face flushed, his eyes swollen and bloodshot, and his demeanor throughout was that of a desperate villain. Mag dared not disobey. The burglar removed the cupboard and once more wrenched away the wainscot.— He thrust his hand into the cavity— The money was not there! With an oath he bounded upon Mag— struck her to the floor—and grasped her throat. `You've got the money!' he thundered, shaking her fiercely, and choking her till her face was black. `Tell me where it is, or you die!' `The cupboard—the top shelf—' gasped Mag. The burglar bounded to the cupboard and ransacked it, searching eagerly for the money; then with a howl of disappointment and rage, he turned fiercely about, and would have struck the woman dead that instant. But she was gone! 3 CHAPTER X. The Sequel. DURING Gordon's absence, the man in glasses treated the whole company, and drank himself, though with great moderation. He waited long for the burglar, but that individual not making his appearance, he began to think he should not have the pleasure of winning any more money from him that night, and proposed to take his leave. `You doesn't go I hope without giving the company all one more nipper,' observed the red-faced proprietor of the establishment.— `Gen'lemen should be gen'rous, when they makes sich winnins as you have here to-night.' And the speaker began to set glasses and liquor upon the counter, taking it for granted Marvin would act in accordance with his friendly and disinterested suggestion. At that moment, even the red-faced proprietor himself, who prided himself on his coolness, was startled by an unexpected incident. Gordon burst into the room, pale, haggard and perfectly desperate. He fixed his eyes at first on Marvin, and did not look aside as he advanced, but gazing at him with a look of determined revenge, approached and grasped his arm. `I have lost all!' he whispered fiercely; `not by you, but it has been stolen! You must lend me now fifty dollars, to give me a chance to win back what I have lost; and if I lose that, I will repay you within a week.' `I am sorry for you,' said the man in glasses, coolly lighting a cigar and giving the landlord change, `but I am no Jew—I never lend money. I should be happy to win another fifty from you, it is true, but I could not think of lending it to you for the purpose. So you will have to wait till some other time, my good fellow—when you get that fifty, for instance.' Gordon, deathly pale, fairly trembled with rage, but Marvin kept his keen, dark eye upon him, which awed him and kept him quiet. Marvin stepped boldly towards the door, regardless of the dark looks not only of Gordon, but of the whole avaricious, desperate crew that coveted the money they knew that he possessed. Marvin passed down Ann street, until he came to a long, narrow court, formed by a mass of low, old fashioned, disagreeable houses, which seemed ashamed to front the street. Approaching one of these, and using his knuckles as a knocker on the door, he aroused an old woman, who appeared with a light. She was a little, dried up, sharp-featured specimen of humanity, that had passed, by considerable, the middle age, and appeared to have tallied her years upon her face in wrinkles. `Who now?' she cried, sharply. `There's somebody always disturbin' us quiet, harmless people, just at this time o' night—and who is it this time, I'd like to know?' `Hold your clatterer, old one,' returned the man in glasses with an oath. `I am no policeman; so don't try to appear needlessly respectable, for I know you, hag—is Joe at home—Joe Jenks?' `He ought to be at this time of night, I hope!' snarled the old woman. `Very good; I want to see him.' `It's too late—you can't come in—' At that moment Marvin slipped a small piece of silver in the woman's hand. `Oh! it is you, is it?' she pursued, quite pleasantly. I didn't know you afore. Come in, do. Don't stumble over them chunks of wood.' And she held the light with the kindest condescension to facilitate Marvin's entrance. `Joe! Joe!' she screamed in the passage. `Who the devil wants Joe, cried a sharp voice from above, where all was dark and gloomy. `A gentleman what wants to see you!' answered the old woman in a shrill key.— `So open your door and show a light, or he will break his neck gittin' up stairs.' Shortly after, at the head of a dilapidated staircase, there appeared a dim lamp, and then the face and shoulders of Light Joe protruded from a hole in the wall. `Come up if you want to see me!' cried Joe, `for it isn't convenient for me to come down. Who are you? what the devil are you after?' Without answering, Marvin stumbled up the creaking staircase. `Good!' exclaimed Joe, recognizing him. `Come in.' To obey this last injunction, the man in glasses had to stoop very low and make his body very small, in order to accommodate his dimensions to those of a cramped and narrow passage, that must be passed by those who would enter Joe's apartments.— With some difficulty he succeeded in crowding his body through, and was soon in the sanctum sanctorum of the young burglar. The room was much more comfortable than one could have expected before enterit; Joe having overlooked the inconvenience of getting access to it, in view of the accommodations of the interior. It was somewhat dirty and contracted, it is true; and the walls were very much worn; the floor rough and bare; but, as Joe remarked to his visitor, `what better could be expected on such reasonable terms?' There was but one chair in the room.— This Joe shoved along the floor to Marvin; he himself sitting on the bed. `I have got some money for you,' said the visitor. `The d— you have!' exclaimed Light Joe, starting to his feet. `How much?' `One hundred dollars. That's all I could raise.' `It ain't enough!' `I can't help it. If that don't suit you, I'll not give you a cent.' `Very well,' said Joe, with a toss of the head. `If that's the case, you can crawl through that hole again as quick as you like. I must have two hundred, or you are a ruined man before two days are over.' `D— you!' exclaimed Marvin, impatiently. `You are a snake—a blood-sucker —a pest! But you shall have no more than one hundred from me, I swear!' Joe was firm. Marvin was at last obliged to come to his terms. He gave the young burglar two hundred dollars, for which Joe gave a receipt, pledging himself to pay it over to Kate, and never to trouble Marvin again. This gentleman knew Joe to be an honorable rogue, and a man of his word; and felt in consequence much more at his ease than before he paid him the money. `Now,' said Joe, clutching the money eagerly, `I'd like to know by what miracle you came by this to-night.' `Cards!' `From whom?' `Your particular friend, Gordon.' `The deuce you did!' exclaimed the young burglar in surprise. `You gulled him then straight! I knew he had money, and thought he'd keep it, but the poor devil can't, it seems. Did you take all he had?' Marvin gave Joe a full account of the game, and repeated what Gordon had said about a part of his money being stolen. `I hope not,' said Joe; `that would be too bad. He was so smart in getting it.— But if he has lost it all, what a rich joke it is all round; the cream of which is, I have a couple of hundred for Kate, whom I shall marry some day!' Joe's mind was occupied with these agreeable reflections as his visitor once more crowded his body through the hole and groped his way down stairs into the street. Scarce had Marvin left the court when a man closely muffled about the face issued from the shadow of a house where he had lain in wait, and stepping softly and cautiously behind him, followed him along the street. It was near midnight, and the streets were for the most part deserted; yet the spy followed Marvin so carefully, and at such a respectful distance, that although they were frequently the only two passing, the man in glasses did not suspect that he was the object of pursuit. They passed through several streets, and still the spy came no nearer Marvin; but at last the latter entered a dark, narrow, and deserted alley, and in an instant the other bounded to his side. Marvin had keen ears, and was on his guard. He wheeled about at the moment the robber aimed a blow at his head with a `slung shot,' and grasped his arm. A struggle ensued, in which the robber drew his knife, but before he could make use of it, Marvin struck him senseless to the ground. `I expected something like this,' said the man in glasses, and he coolly dragged the robber back to the entrance of the alley.— `The fool might have known I would be on guard, and that it would take more than one to rob me. But who have we here?' he continued, as he pulled the man towards the light. Just as I thought—Gordon!' The burglar staggered to his feet, Marvin still holding him by the throat. `Kill me and done with it!' muttered Gordon. `I meant to have done the same by you. I am mad to night, and would as lief die as live.' `I should think so!' returned Marvin.— `You must be insane. What the devil do you mean by coming upon me in this manner?' `You have got all my money!' replied Gordon, sullenly. `I meant to take back at least a part of it, for I haven't a penny in the world. I have lost a thousand dollars this night—and all by foul means! You cheated me and another robbed me!' `Wretched simpleton!' exclaimed Marvin, `you scruple not to rob others, and are driven mad when robbed yourself. You win giadly from others, but when you lose, you attribute it to foul play. Now let me advise you to go your way and be quiet, and to bear your losses like a philosopher. In the morning you will be sober, and be ashamed of this. Good night.' With these words, Marvin disappeared in the dark passage, leaving Gordon rooted to the spot. The burglar ground his teeth with rage, and shook his clenched hand at the retreating figure, but dared not follow the powerful man again. After a pause of some minutes, he turned sullenly away and stalked back to his home in Centre street. Arrived there, he found the door of his apartments locked and bolted on the inside, and he could not enter. He struck the clattering pannels with his fist, and with a savage oath called upon whoever might be within to open. No voice replied. `By —!' thundered Gordon, stamping the floor till the house jarred; `it is you. Meg, in there; and if you don't open. I'll break down the door, and crush you to atoms!' Still there was no answer. With all the force hatred and determined rage supplied, the burglar threw himself against the door. The lock was burst away —the bolts cracked—the door swung upon its hinges—but a strong chain clanked across the entrance, preventing the door from opening more than just sufficient to allow him to look through the crack into the room. By the light of a lamp burning within, he saw Meg Munson, standing erect in the centre of the apartment, a smile of triumph on her grim features, and a glittering knife in her strong right hand. In her left she held a small bundle over the hot coals in the uncovered stove. With a yell of rage Gordon saw that it was a bundle of bank-notes. `Back!' screamed the woman, glaring at the red eyes that gleamed through the crevice of the door, and brandishing the knife. `If you break through I'll drop these bills into the fire and stab you with this knife!' Gordon ground his teeth with rage, but dared not force the door, knowing as he did the terrible temper of the woman within. `Here,' pursued Meg, shaking the bank-notes over the coals, is your half of the money. I have taken my share because you did not offer it to me willingly; and it is where you will never find it unless I point out the spot where it is hidden. Promise not to harm me, and you shall come in and have your money; and if you behave yourself, you may have the rest some day. For some minutes Gordon made no reply, but Meg could see a pair of fiery eyes in the dark passage without the door, and she could hear him grind his teeth and foam at the mouth. His rage was terrible, and she knew it well, but she knew too that when he saw her firm it would subside. She was not mistaken. In a short time Gordon spoke to her again, asking her to let him in, and soon, promising all she required, he entreated her to put up the knife and undo the chain that barred his entrance. She then spoke kindly yet friendly to him in return, and handed him the money through the crevice, which he clutched as the hungry lion does his prey. When she saw him perfectly sober she took away the chain and let him in, still holding in her strong hand her keen weapon of defence, and warning him not to break his promise. Gordon threw himself heavily upon a chair, and with his money grasped in his brawny hands, and his brow gathered into a frown, sat for half an hour gazing fiercely and silently at the dying embers in the stove. Meg, meanwhile, leaving him alone, went into Kate's room, and threw herself upon the bed to sleep, with the knife still clutched in her hand. CHAPTER XI. The Housebreaker. IT WAS towards noon of the day succeeding the night on which the incidents we have related took place, that Light Joe boldly made his appearance at Acton Hall, and inquired for Kate. The girl came forward on hearing his voice, and conducted him into the kitchen, where they were alone. The young burglar gave her a full account of the incidents of the preceding night, and dwelt at length on his interview with Marvin. He had seen Gordon who had related to him all his troubles, and consulted about making an immediate attack upon the hidden treasures at Acton Hall. It was on this important business, chiefly, that Joe had come to visit Kate, that final arrangements might be made for the robbery; and it was also to bring the girl the glad intelligence that Marvin had given her two hundred dollars, which he, Joe, had put in the bank in her name. Kate was in good spirits, and the presence of the reckless youth she loved inspired her to be as reckless as himself. Her better feelings were smothered in her heart as she coolly plotted with the young burglar for the robbery of her master. She put into his hands the keys she had found to fit certain locks, and giving him concise directions where to find money, plate and other valuables, let him fully into the plan of the house. `Recollect, Kate,' said Joe, `that you must know nothing about the affair. You will, of course, be asleep while we break into the house without any of your assistance. Lock and bar the doors carefully before going to bed, so that none can suspect that you have anything to do with the robbery. We must enter the kitchen first, for that window will be easily raised, there being only a spring and a button to fasten it. But the dog?' `I was just going to speak to you about Pluto,' said Kate, `and ask if you could send me some sure poison this afternoon.' `I always come prepared for such emergencies,' replied Light Joe, producing a small package from his vest pocket. `One quarter of this is sure—if Pluto takes it, he will go to the shades of his namesake instanter.' `I feed him,' said Kate, `and I will see that he takes the dose. But won't I be suspected?' `By no means. He'll die suddenly, and nobody will mistrust that he was poisoned till after the robbery takes place; then it will be said that the burglars managed to dose the dog and get rid of him before-hand.' `Very well,' said Kate; `the dog shan't trouble you. What time have you set for the work?' `We shall probably be here at one or two o'clock to-night. I hope the family will enjoy a good night's rest!' Soon after Light Joe took his leave, having every thing prepared for the burglary. Kate did not allow her conscience to trouble her for her black-hearted treachery, but stifling it when it would have chidden, determined boldly to carry out the work she had commenced. At three o'clock in the afternoon, Mr. Acton's coachman came to the house in great haste, informing the family that Pluto was acting strangely, appearing to be in great pain. Mr. Acton went to the kennel with the man, and found the dog just in the agonies of death. Ten minutes after, Edith, Irving and Mrs. Acton went out to look at the faithful animal, that had just breathed his last. Kate and Mrs. Barnes also stole into the yard to get a glance at him. `What can have been the matter with him?' Kate heard Edith ask of Mr. Acton. `He has been poisoned!' replied his master. `Who could do such a deed?' exclaimed Mr. Acton with a shudder. Kate became pale as death, and would have fled, but Mrs. Barnes drew her along towards the dead animal, and she dared not resist. `It is impossible to say,' replied Mr. Acton; `some secret enemy perhaps—or rather,' he added quickly, `villains who mediate a robbery, and would have the dog out of their way.' Kate trembled violently. `What is the matter, Catherine?' asked Mrs. Acton, glancing at her as she came up. `Poor Pluto!' she murmured. `Ah! you are a kind-hearted girl,' said Edith, `and I knew you loved the dog. But you are pale.' `Mr. Acton spoke about robbers,' put in Mrs. Barnes, coming to the girl's relief. `It makes me shudder to think of them, myself.' `I shall be prepared for them to-night, and for several nights to come,' said Mr. Acton, turning away. `You will look well to the doors and windows, Mrs. Barnes.' Kate was agitated, fearing no longer her own detection, but the failure of the enterprise of her accomplices, and their arrest. There was no way to send them word to warn them of their danger, and no way she could devise to throw Mr. Acton off his guard. Towards night she saw Mr. Acton give a pair of pistols to Stevens, the coachman, telling him to scour them and make them ready for use. She began to fear not only the arrest of her friends, but she trembled to think Joe might lose his life. And still she could think of no way to warn him of the danger! At a late hour the anxious girl retired— not to sleep, but to pass a night, of terror and suspense, expecting, as she did, to bear at every moment the report of pistols, and the noise of bloody combat. The family had all retired save Mr. Acton, who now went about the house, carefully examining all the locks and bolts, and window springs, to see that all was fast.— Having done this, and satisfied himself that it would be no easy task for robbers to enter the house, he placed his pistols on a stand within his reach, and threw himself in an easy chair by his wife's bedside. Meanwhile, true to their purpose, Gordon and Joe Jenks were pushing forward to perpetrate the contemplated robbery. It was a night well suited to their purpose —dark, cold and windy. Although they imagined that the roughness of the night would drown in its continual clamor all lesser sounds occasioned by their work, they were not the less cautious or silent on that account. It was past two when they arrived at Mr. Acton's house, and Joe conducted his companion at once to the kitchen window in the rear, upon which they intended to make the first attack. `Be devilish sly,' whispered Joe, as he turned to his accomplice, after pointing out the window in question; `and be ready with your knife—for if the dog should'nt be dead—' `I'll manage him,' muttered Gordon. The window was very low, and the burglars had an excellent opportunity of effecting an entrance in that quarter. Gordon took from a bag he carried with him several instruments, and handed them to Light Joe, who being the more skillful of the two, naturally took the lead. In a hasty, yet in the most delicate and noiseless manner, Joe removed a pane of glass, and gave it to Gordon to dispose of. The moment after the young burglar inserted his hand terough the vacant square, and with the same despatch and stealth, took away the fastenings and raised the window. `Wait for me here,' he whispered to Gordon, `until I can explore the premises.— This would be a tight place to leap through in a hurry, and we must have a front door open, in readiness, in case of alarm.' So saying, the young burglar crept cautiously through the window, and placed his feet upon the floor. He wore India-rubbers, and his step was as noiseless as that of a cat, as in the midst of the impenetrable darkness, he groped his way to the interior of the house. He was soon in the hall; no longer erect, but creeping like a serpent along the floor; and then his hand was upon the door.— With the utmost caution he withdrew the bolts, turned the key which had been left in the lock, and noiselessly essayed to ascertain if the door would open. The next moment the cold night air breathed through the narrow crevice into the Hall. Leaving the door so that it could be easily opened, Joe crept back to the kitchen to inform Gordon of his success. `Come on now with the bag,' he whispered. `Softly! or our plans are knocked in the head at once! Follow me!' `Joe!' whispered Gordon, pulling him by the sleeve. `What?' `Remember what I told you about your pocket light. Don't spring it if you can get along without. Now go on.' A minute after both burglars were in the hall. It was pitchy dark, and Gordon felt as much lost as if he had been in the catacombs of Egypt. Joe having led him to hall door, however, and back again to the door which opened into the rooms it was his intention to visit, he began to feel quite at home, and anxious to go about his work. He now knew about as much of the house as his young companion, Joe's knowledge of the apartments having been obtained entirely from the explanations of Kate; yet the most delicate part of the work was left to the young burglar. Leaving Gordon near the hall door, Joe once more set out to explore the ground of his proposed operations. Gordon knew that Joe entered another room, and that the door through which he passed was open. Yet so silent was every thing throughout the house that he doubted whether his companion had stirred half a dozen feet from the door. He waited for him full ten minutes, hearing no sound save that of the hoarse winds without, and the monotonous tickings of a clock in one of the inner apartments. Once he heard, or fancied he heard, the grating of a lock, but it might have been anything else but that— the cocking of a pistol he thought. At last, when Gordon was little thinking his companion was moving near him, there was a light touch upon his knee, and he heard a suppressed whisper. `Here is a bag of gold—it must be gold —I found in the chest Kate spoke of. I could find no money in the drawers. Put this lump in your bag, and I'll search for the plate. Then if we're prospered, I'll venture into Acton's bed-room, and rifle his pockets.' `Go on,' said Gordon, `I leave it all to you.' Once more Joe crept along the carpeted floor, noiselessly and slow, and Gordon was left alone in the hall. Five minutes more passed, and he returned with his hands full of silver-ware—salvers, vases, plates and spoons. `This is not all,' he whispered, as Gordon slipped it into his bag. `Kate said it was a good haul, and she was right.' And he returned again to his work. Acton! watchful man! art thou sleeping now, whilst the villains thou didst prepare thyself to meet are robbing thee of thy riches? Joe's last expedition was as successful as the other, and he had the pleasure of putting into the hands of Gordon a load of silver no less valuable than the first. `This is the last,' said Joe. `Now we must venture on more dangerous ground— Acton's private apartments. Leave your bag at the door, Gordon, when you can catch it up as you pass out—for I charge you with that—and follow me. If Acton should awake, both of us could master him in an instant, and dash out of the house with our booty; while one alone would stand a fair chance of meeting with unpleasant opposition. Gordon obeyed, and was soon groping his way behind Joe, towards the sleeping chamber of Mr. Acton. Arrived at the door, Joe arose slowly to his feet, and cautiously tried the latch. The door was not locked, and Joe pushed it slowly open. In an instant he started back in surprise on seeing a light burning in the room. It gleamed through the doorway upon him, and by its dim rays the burglars looked at each other, but too bold to retreat, they resolved to see what dangers lay in their way. Joe pushed the door open still farther, and gazed within. Thore sat Mr. Acton in his arm-chair, sleeping, and upon the table by his side lay his pistols, ready for use.— Upon the bed lay a beautiful woman, at sight of whom Gordon's features lit up with a diabolical smile. He had seen that fair countenance before, and strange associations were called up by the view. She was sleeping, like her husband. Gordon glanced at her for a moment, then turned to Light Joe, beckoning him to go on. Creeping close to the carpet once more, the young burglar entered the bed chamber, and approached the table. The lamp burned dimply, and with a wave of his hand he made the flickering flame leap up, and fall, and quiver, as if it scarce could cling to its parent wick. He touched it, and the room was in total darkness. It was Joe's intention to break open a strong chest in the room, before doing which he thought it best to remove the pistols from Acton's reach. He touched one—he laid it carefully on the floor under Acton's chair— he felt for the other to put it in his own pocket, when, with a sudden spring, Acton bounded to his feet. Joe darted towards the door, and Acton, firing at random in that direction, made the whole house ring with the sharp report, and saw by the pistol's flash the retreating forms of the two burglars. He rushed upon them. With the lightness of a cat Joe darted through a side door; then, in order to divert the pursuit towards himself and enable Gordon to escape with the booty, he stumbled along towards the kitchen, where all was dark and silent. He heard no sound in all the house, for the flying footsteps of Gordon and their pursuer had suddenly ceased. The young burglar leaped through the window and escaped alone. CHAPTER XII. The Spectre. For several minutes, Light Joe prowled about the house, waiting for his accomplice to appear. He waited in vain. The burglar had either got off before him, else he was detained by unaccountable circumstances in the house. Still, all within was silent and dark; and Joe was on the point of entering the hall to carry off the booty, which Gordon, even had he escaped, could not have taken with him, when, glimmering through the curtains in various parts of the house, he saw lights, several in number, moving to and fro. Still there was no sound; and hoping Gordon had got off before him, the young burglar hastened from the spot. His accomplice was less fortunate. Instead of finding his way safely into the hall, and thence into the open air, confused by Joe's escape towards the kitchen, Gordon attempted to follow him, trusting to his young companion to lead him safely to the hall door. In the darkness he neither found the kitchen nor the hall, but rushed blindly on, until, reaching a back doorway, he took a terrific leap, and went whirling over and over—down—down—striking against jagged walls, projecting timbers, and rough-hewn planks, and falling with a heavy jar upon a cold, solid, earthy floor. For more than a minute, he lay like a corpse upon the ground, motionless as if every bone in his body had been crushed by the fearful fall. At last, with a groan, he lifted his hand to his bursting forehead, then slowly raising himself to a sitting posture, rolled his strained eye-balls in their aching sockets, and stared at the rayless gloom of the black chaos into which he had fallen.— All was dark and noiseless as the tomb. Where was he? A faint recollection of stepping blindly upon a floorless space, and of being hurled headlong down, broke upon his mind, and then came the startling remembrance of the manner in which he had met with the terrible fall. The truth flashed upon him. He had fallen into a deep, dark, dismal cellar. Fortunately no bones were broken, and in a few minutes he began to recover from the shock. Feeling for his pocket lantern, he was rejoiced to find that it had not been crushed. He hesitated before he opened it; then he let a ray of bright light stream into the surrounding blackness, pointing out the horrors of his situation, and closed the lantern again in a moment. He was in the midst of barrels, bins and boxes, stone jars and iron bound casks, all of which were surrounded by cold and mouldy walls, that showed, as the beam of light quivered around upon them, innumerable pearls of sparkling frost upon their jagged sides. Above him, arose a steep flight of stairs, down which he had been precipitated; and on either side, cut in the top of the wall, were narrow grated windows. At the right was a ponderous plank, locked and defended by heavy bars of iron. Gordon was debating in his mind which of three things he should do; endeavor to escape into the open air through the plank door; to dash boldly up the stairs, and striking down all opposition, rush from the house; or to lie secreted among the boxes and casks until a more convenient time;— when a circumstance caused him to decide on adopting the latter course. A light appeared at the head of the stairs, then there was a sound of footsteps on the topmost plank. Gordon crouched down behind a group of barrels, awaiting the approach of the nocturnal visitor. Slowly down he came into the dismal cellar; a glaring light in his left hand, and a pistol grasped in his right; his features deathly pale, yet his lips compressed, and his eyes flashing with determined courage. It was Mr. Acton! Scarce had he reached the foot of the stairs, and taken three steps upon the cold earthy floor, looking cautiously about him, when, suddenly starting from the shadows which the flickering light failed to penetrate, there arose before him the grim and ghastly features of the burglar. For an instant those two men, between whom there was such a mysterious connection, stood gazing at each other, motionless, pale and speechless as two marble statues. Then with a deadly fire flashing in his eye, Acton leveled his pistol at Gordon's breast, his features working with an expression of determined hatred: yet he did not fire. Gordon stood proudly up before him, his arms folded upon his broad chest, and a scowl of defiance darkening his brow. `Fire—and be d—d forever!' muttered the burglar, without moving a muscle. `You dare not! for, look you, she would surely have a curiosity to behold the corpse of the daring robber—and think you she would not recognize me? Fire—if you dare do such a murder!' Acton dropped the weapon by his side, biting his lips with rage. `It is well you spoke of her,' he whispered hoarsely, `else I had blown your heart out, as I once threatened to do if you ever crossed my path again. Damnable villain! was it not enough that you extorted a thousand dollars from me by treachery? But you shall suffer for this!' `How so?' sneered the robber. `Will you keep me a prisoner now that you have me in your power? Ha! ha! I'd laugh to see you attempt a thing like that. A prisoner! Know that prisoners have influence in their way, and that mine would be a terrible one, should I exert it against you. Could I no contrive to communicate with her? Ha! ha!' It was a hoarse laugh and a ghastly smile that shocked the senses of Mr. Acton, for the burglar, not yet recovered from his fall, was feeble and pale as a corpse The light trembled in Acton's clenched hand, and the muscles of his face worked with the conflicting emotions of his breast, as the dauntless robber thus hurled defiance in his teeth with the assurance that he durst not resent the insult. `Have done with your foolish boasting!' muttered Acton, with fierce impatience.— `Tell me what you would have.' The robber smiled disdainfully. `Since, instead of getting off with my booty, I have tumbled into this hellish pit, all I can ask is, that you conduct me safely into the open air, and promise to do your utmost to get me free, should I unfortunately be arrested.' Acton ground his teeth with rage at the thought that he could do no less than favor the escape of a villain who, having already done so much to injure him, would on the present occasion have robbed his house.— He felt forced to let him go. `Come,' growled the burglar, `if you act, act quickly. Go up and see that the way is clear, then when all is ready, come down and let me know, and I'll make my exit.' Acton returned up the stairs with the light, and finding nobody in the room above save Stevens, who had sprung out of bed the moment there was a pistol fired, he managed to send him away, and returned to the cellar. `Now, begone!' he exclaimed, grasping the robber by the shoulder; `begone! and never,' he added in a hoarse whisper, shaking him fiercely; `never, if you value your life, cross my path again. I'd rather kill you, and suffer the worst that could happen, than be thus maddened by suspense. Remember my words and begone!' With a grim smile of triumph, Gordon turned away, and reeling from the stunning effects of his fall, staggered to the staircase which he climbed, watched by Acton, who held the light to assist his escape. The burglar had disappeared above, and Acton was beginning to breathe quite easily, when a shriek and a fall on the floor above awakened his worst fears. With headlong haste he mounted the stairs, and rushed into the room from whence the shriek had come. His wife lay senseless on the floor, with a broken lamp beside her on the carpet. Acton raised her in his arms, calling loudly for help. In a moment Edith Irving was by her side, and Mrs. Barnes, Kate and the coachman soon crowded into the room. Mrs. Acton, restored to consciousness, cast a wild and haggard look about her, shuddering at the sight of her terrified friends, and clasped her husband's hand conclusively. They placed her in an easy chair, and she soon recovered her faculties sufficiently to speak. `Stay with me,' she whispered to her husband. `Let the rest go.' Edith and the servants left the room. `Did you see it?' asked Mrs. Acton, eagerly, with a wild stare at her husband's face. `No—what was it?' asked Mr. Acton, pale and agitated. `A ghost!' whispered his wife, shuddering. `A ghost!' `If ever there was a ghost—which I begin to believe. How it terrified me!' `Speak! Explain yourself!' `Oh! would that you had seen that form —those features!' exclaimed Mrs. Acton.— `So white! so ghastly! and so like—' `Like whom?' interrupted Acton. She whispered a word in his ear. `Impossible!' he exclaimed in a voice he intended to be firm, but which trembled in spite of himself. `You must have been dreaming.' `No—no! I am sure—I know a being— whether earthly or unearthly, I cannot say —arose before me as I entered the room.— The features were his! though so deathly pale that they looked unnatural! You may deem it weakness in me to faint as I did at sight of him, but his countenance was so grim and horrid, and bore such a resemblance to—' `I understand—' `That I believe if you had seen him, you too would have been terrified. Then he looked at me with such a savage grin! oh! 'twas terrible!' `Which way did he go?' `He arose as if from the cellar, and glided away—I know not whither, for I fainted.' `Do not mention this, my dear,' said Mr. Acton. `That man was probably a robber who had remained hidden in the house; and his resemblance to one who is dead was all in your imagination.' `It must be so,' assented his wife, `but I must confess I had the weakness to fancy it was a ghost at first sight. How foolish! do not mention it!' Mr. Acton was no less agitated than his wife, but from a different cause. He knew too well that the resemblance she had mentioned was no production of the fancy! The alarm caused by the robbers had so disturbed the household that sleep, for the remainder of the night, was out of the question. While Mr. Acton and his wife, together with Edith, were conversing upon the subject that had so excited them all, Mrs. Barnes, Kate, and the coachman, assembled in the kitchen, were talking in whispers about the daring robbery. They were sorely tormented by a curiosity to know the cause of Mrs. Acton's fainting, not being altogether satisfied with the explanation that one of the robbers, having remained in the house, passed through the room she was in. Kate, who had already a knowledge of the connection existing between Gordon and Mr. Acton, although she did not understand the nature of it, came nearer than the others in her surmises, yet she wisely kept her opinions to herself. While Kate felt greatly rejoiced that her friends had escaped from the house, she could not but feel disappointed in the failure of their plot. Yet, as she reflected on the circumstances of the case, and thought of all the Actons had done for her, she shuddered at her own black ingratitude, and felt a secret joy—something she could not explain even to herself—at the ill success of her treachery. The fact of the case was, Mrs. Acton and her sister Edith, had both talked to her frequently, endeavoring in a kindly manner to instil lessons of virtue into her mind; and often, when free from the influence of her evil associates, all the better feelings of her nature had been awakened, and she had resolved to try to become as good as they. CHAPTER XIII. An important Link in the Chain. The failure of the attempted robbery of Mr. Acton's house was a great disappointment to Gordon and his accomplices. Not an article of value was taken away, and the burglars had the satisfaction of knowing that all their deep laid plans and golden hopes had been in vain. Of them all, Mag Munson was, perhaps, the greatest sufferer from the ill success of the plot. This had been projected by her, and she had fondly trusted in the skill of Gordon and Light Joe to reap the harvest of her schemes. When the failure was made known to her, she was at first in a great rage, but at last another plan of making money out of the Actons, and of having a sort of revenge on them, entered her head. She mentioned it to Gordon, who, ready to grasp at anything, approved of it, and on the morning following the incidents related in our last chapter, she set out to have a conference with Kate. This wretched girl, in whose heart the balance of Good and Evil was in such a precarious, varying state, forgot the good resolutions she had made when there were no bad influences to lead her astray, and once more promised to lend her assistance to do a work of evil. Mag Munson then left her, their plans having been completed, and a time set for carrying them out. In the afternoon there was a visitor at Acton Hall. Mr. Acton and Edith Irving had gone to Boston, and Mrs. Acton received him alone. It was Gustavus Burnam. It was on this occasion that the talents of that distinguished gentleman shone in all their brilliancy. Had there been hundreds listening to him, he could not have displayed the powers of his intellect to greater advantage. Yet there was no effort—at least, there appeared to be none—in his conversation or his manners. He seemed at once the perfect gentleman, the accomplished scholar, the man of observation, and the profound thinker. He had been conversing for some time on the subject his friends most loved to have him dwell upon—viz: his travels—when Mrs. Acton remarked in a careless manner: `I believe there is not a quarter of the globe worth visiting that you have not visited, and of which I have not heard you relate some interesting incident; but I think I have never heard you say in what part of the world you were born.' `I am an American,' returned Gustavus, briefly. `I supposed so, but what part of—' Burnam knew she was about to inquire the place of his birth, and anxious to avoid giving an answer to such a question, interrupted her as if he had not heard her. `I am an American,' said he, `and I glory in the name. In all my travels I have never seen a land I would more gladly own as that of my nativity, than this. There are no institutions like ours, no laws superior to our own in the wide world. I speak this from conviction, for, had I cause of prejudice, it would probably be against that code by which I myself have been made a sufferer—that is, the American code of laws.' Mrs. Acton started and looked at her visitor earnestly, as if eager to hear an explanation of his words. `Start not,' pursued Gustavus, `when I tell you that years ago, I suffered injustice from the laws of my own country. An innocent man, I was charged with murder, convicted, and sentenced to be hung!' Mrs. Acton sank back in her chair, and became pale as if Death had that moment breathed a pestilence upon her, marking her for the tomb. Her frame became rigid, her lips ashy, and a cold perspiration started from her ghastly brow; and then she sat motionless and dumb, her eyes fixed, as if never to be removed thence, upon her visitor's face. Burnam, meanwhile, appeared as if nothing had happened, and went on with the same reserved coolness as before. `I was condemned to be hung for a crime of which I had not dreamed until it was announced to me, and I was charged with it. I was tried; circumstances were strong against me; I was judged guilty. Before the day set for my execution arrived, however, I escaped from prison, and fled my native land. `I fled my native land, America, because I had nothing to keep me here. I was in despair, for I was not only deemed guilty by the world at large, but—which was worse by far!—by a lady whom I loved. She thought me a criminal; she spurned me— changed her love—for once she loved me well—to bitter hatred; and I left her, keeping as a sole remembrance of her inconstancy and distrust, a jewel she had given me as a memento of her love—THAT RING!' And Burnam, having placed, unobserved, a diamond of peculiar brilliancy, set in a ring of purest gold, upon his hand, now held it out before Mrs. Acton's eyes. `That ring!' she shrieked—`I gave it to you—I know it well—and you are—' `The man you spurned as a criminal!' interrupted Burnam with a bitter smile. It was no time then for triumph or reproach, for Mrs. Acton had fainted. Gustavus took from his pocket a small flask, the contents of which, the moment it was applied to Mrs. Acton's lips, restored her to consciousness. In an instant she sprang to her feet and flew across the room, as if to escape from the presence of a monster. Burnam stood with folded arms and composed features, following her with his stern and steady gaze. `Be seated,' said he, calmly, `I do not intend to injure you in any way, but only to convince you that I am not the guilty man you have believed me to be till now. Had you visited me in prison, and conversed with me after my arrest, I might have convinced you long ago; but you shunned me as if I had been a reptile, and with admirable dispatch united yourself to my rival, Mr. Acton. Now I have the proofs of my innocence within my reach, as well as the proofs of another's guilt.' Mrs. Acton quailed before the magic influence of Burnam's stern black eye, and sat down upon the sofa, burying her face in her hands. Burnam sat down by her side, and in winning tones and eloquent language, endeavored to soothe her, and calm her perturbed spirit. His efforts were not in vain. Soon she forgot that she had ever deemed him guilty, and hung upon his words with the same interest and delight as before she was aware of his identity with him, who, years before, was sentenced to suffer death. She did not look upon him as her former lover, nor as the despised criminal, nor as the accomplished stranger whose acquaintance she had recently made; but rather as a man of a noble nature that had been foully wronged, of deep feelings that had been deeply wrung, and of a superior soul, that, when the world would have depressed it, soared beyond the scope of common mind, grasping at all knowledge, and waxing but the brighter from the clouds by which it had been oppressed. If once she loved him, she now regarded him with admiration and awe. She could not pity him for what he had suffered, for we have no such feeling for those we consider superior to ourselves, but she felt forced to respect him the more highly for all he had endured. At times she could not realize the identity between Burnam and her old lover, and then again, the truth would flash upon her mind, startling her with the thought of the connection existing between him and that strange man. `Had you never,' asked Gustavus, at last, `suspected who I was before to-day?' `Your features, I often thought, resembled some one I had seen before,' replied Mrs. Acton, `but they are greatly altered — as much so as I ever saw features alter in the space of twelve years. The expression — except of the eye alone, perhaps — is changed entirely. Yet, now I think of it, your countenance is the same, with the exception of the sternness and dignified authority time has added to it, and the dark hue it has caught from the ardor of torrid climates.' `And have you ever thought you recognized me?' asked Burnam. `I should have thought so sometimes,' answered Mrs. Acton, `had not your assumed name, and other circumstances, rendered such a thing out of the question.' `And Mr. Acton —' `I never heard him speak of you except as a new acquaintance, and do not think he has any suspicions of who you are.' `That is well,' replied Gustavus, `and for the present I would not have him know me. The time is not yet come for me to bring forward proofs of my innocence, and until that time comes, none but you must be entrusted with the secret.' Burnam's influence over Mrs. Acton was almost supernatural, and she was readily brought to promise that her husband should know nothing of what had happened that afafternoon. It was evening before the interview between Mrs. Acton and Gustavus Burnam was ended and the latter took his leave. Meanwhile important events were taking place in another quarter, to which we will now turn our attention. At dusk Kate went out to walk, and to amuse Robert, Mr. Acton's only child.— She played with him and ran with him until they had got some distance from the house, when they sat down together upon a rock by the road near a rugged hill-side covered with thickets. `What noise is that?' asked Robert, hearing a peculiar whistle in the bushes a short way up the hill. Kate was agitated, and as she made no reply, the boy asked her if she was frightened. `No,' she answered, `but what noise was it? Sit here, Robert, and I will go and see.' `Go quick, dear Kate,' said he, `and I'll wait for you here.' Kate disappeared. Following the sound which was again repeated, the girl soon came in sight of an object crouched down in the thicket. She approached it and it advanced to meet her. It was not so dark but that one could have seen plainly that it was the form of a large and powerful woman. `The child is there,' said Kate, `but I beg of you not to take it. The more I think of it—' `Hush, your nonsense!' exclaimed Mag Munson—for it was she—`you are always prating about your conscientious scruples, which you ought to be above. You've done well to keep your promise, and now don't spoil it all by feeling bad about it. Stop here till I can get off with the boy, and then make your way back to the house and tell the best story you can.' So saying, Mag Munson shook off the girl rudely, and hastened down the hill.— Kate covered her eyes with her hands, and sobbed violently. Bitterly did she repent having lent her hand to mischief, but it was too late to atone for the error. She heard a struggle and a cry, and heard Robert call her by name for help, and then there was a sound of rapid footsteps that died away in the distance. With a bursting heart she descended the hill, to find that both Margaret and the boy had disappeared. All about her was silence and deep gloom, that filled her guilty soul with terror. She would have fled, whither she cared not—any where to avoid the presence of those who had treated her so kindly, and had been so foully wronged by her in return—but the appearance of a carriage caused her to return to Mr. Acton's house. CHAPTER XIV. The Stolen Child. MR. ACTON and Edith Irving had just returned home, and it was upon their ears that first fell the cries of Mrs. Barnes— `Robert is lost! Robert is lost!' In a minute the whole house was in alarm Mrs. Acton, pale from the effects of her recent agitation, rushed forward to know the truth of the report. `Who says Robert is lost?' she cried. `I say so,' replied Mrs. Barnes, dragging the trembling Kate into the room. `This poor girl has been hunting for him, she says, for the last half hour, thinking he had gone but a little way, and not wishing to give you any needless alarm. But the boy ain't to be found, she says; and she is frightened to death about it, poor thing! Robert! poor Robert! he is lost!' Inquiries and immediate search were made, but Robert was no where to be found, and none could throw any light upon his fate. Leaving his friends maddened with anxiety to know what had become of him, and harassed by forebodings that something terrible had happened to him, let us follow the boy himself, and watch him in the dangers through which he may pass. The child screamed lustily when he saw a strange dark female approaching, issuing from the bushes among which Kate had disappeared. He ran but a step when she caught him up, and placing her hand upon his mouth, hurried away. Margaret kept in by-places, where none would observe her, until it was quite dark, when she sought the open road, and hurried on towards Boston. Robert struggled at first with all his might, but he was soon worn out and exhausted, and lay like an infant at repose in the arms of the old woman. At last she set him upon his feet, and told him gruffly that he must walk; for she was tired of carrying him, she said. `I'm glad of it,' said Robert, `I didn't want you carry me at all.' `But you must walk now!' `Who are you to talk to me so?' he asked proudly. `Never mind who I am,' replied Mag, `but take my hand and come along.' `I want to go home!' said the child suddenly; `and I won't stir a step unless you take me there. You had no right to carry me away; indeed, it was very wrong, and mother will tell you so.' `Let us go to your mother, and see what she will say.' `I'll go to her, but I'll walk alone,' said Robert. `I won't be seen taking your hand!' `You won't? Why, you little imp?' `Because I don't like you.' `And why not?' `Because you don't look good. You was n't kind to me either when you put your hand over my mouth and squeezed me so!' Seeing that he was determined not to walk, Mag Munson dragged the child along by the wrist; and then when he screamed with pain, she caught him up angrily in her arms, and struck him on the cheek. `I'll teach you, you saucy imp!' she muttered, stopping his cries with her brawny hand. `Now, be still, or I'll kill you!' `You may,' screamed the boy, `but I won't be still!' Once more the heavy hand was upon his mouth, and he was borne powerless away. In a little while they came to where the houses stood more closely together, and carriages were more frequent, and the way was thronged by many men on foot. Here Robert screamed and struggled again, but nobody noticed him, and Margaret still carried him on. Several times the old woman tried, by promises and threats to induce him to walk, but he obstinately refused, telling her she might kill him if she liked, but that he would not take one step to please her. So she was obliged to carry him in her arms through the town which she did putting him down to rest but four times before she reached her home in the centre of the city. `Put me down! I want to go home!' screamed Robert, terrified at the sight of the filthy localities through which he was carried. `This is your home,' said Mag, as she dragged him up the dilapidated stair case to her abode in Centre street. `This is your home now.' `This ain't my home!' retorted Robert, `I never lived in such a nasty place as this, and never will.' `Not with me?' sneered Mag. `With you!' exclaimed the child contemptuously. `I wouldn't live with you in a palace, you ugly old monster!' Mag laughed disdainfully, and dragged the child into her room on the second floor. Gordon was there, and by the flickering light of a dim lamp, the boy could take a fair survey of his new home, and of those who were to be his tyrants. `It's too bad!' he muttered, bursting into tears of rage. `To take me away from my pretty home and all kindred friends, and to bring me here to shut me up in this ugly hole! You old monster!' he continued, his eyes flashing through his tears at Mag, `I wish I was a man, big enough to tear you into pieces!' And he stamped the floor with his little foot, spitefully, as if he imagined he had the old woman beneath his heel, and was crushing her to atoms. But as yet he had suffered only the commencement of the indignities that were to be heaped upon him. After sitting down and laughing heartily at the child's rage, Mag dragged him towards her, and began to take off his clothes. Resistance would have been vain, so Robert suffered the indignity in sullen silence. His embroidered collar, his pretty velvet coat and figured vest were taken away, and then the remainder of his clothing even to his stockings and shoes. Spitefully then did he clench his little fists and grind his teeth as he saw his garments rolled together in a heap, tossed upon a pile of dirty rags in one corner of the room. But this was not all! Oh! that such an indignity should be thrust upon a proud spirited fiery boy like Master Robert Acton! he was not allowed even the common habiliments of the male sex, of which he flattered himself he was no mean specimen; but a ragged, faded calico frock that had been worn out by some ugly, dirty faced girl; a clumsy pair of shoes that gaped open at the toes as if they were laughing at his sorry plight; and a colorless, tattered cotton bonnet, were the only garments in which he, his father's only son, was shamefully attired. `This is your home, and these are your clothes,' said Mag, when she had finished dressing him. Robert made no reply, but having cast one angry glance at the unseemly rags that hung so loosely about his slender, delicate limbs, clutched his little fingers in the unworthy dress, and rent it asunder as if it had been made of paper. `Very good, said Mag, laughing. `You shall wear it now as it is.' In a fit of passion Robert threw himself upon the floor, where, except that his bitter frowns at long intervals convulsed with heart breaking sobs, he lay as motionless as a corpse Meanwhile Gordon and Mag disputed with each other, about what should be done with the child until a convenient time arrived for claiming the reward that would be offered for his restoration; which dispute—as was often the case with disputes between that amiable pair—ended in a quarrel. Gordon, who had contended that it was dangerous to keep the boy in the house that night, owing to the possibility of his being traced thither, suddenly snatched him up as he lay upon the floor, and without informing Mag what he intended doing with him, rushed with him from the house. `Oh!' exclaimed Robert, gratefully, `you will carry me home, won't you?' `I'll carry you away from her,' muttered Gordon. `Thank you!' said Robert. `She is a monster! I hate her; don't you?' Gordon didn't know what to say, nor hardly what he said; but answered— `Yes!' `I thought you must. But what do you live with her for?' This time Gordon didn't see fit to answer him at all, but hurried along. `I'll walk now, if you want me to,' said the boy. `I wouldn't walk for her, because she wasn't kind to me, but since you are going to take me home, I'll do as you say.' Gordon put down his burden, and Robert trotted along by his side as fast as he could in the awakward dress he wore. `You are very good to me,' said the child, as Gordon led him along a brilliantly lighted street. `I wish you'd tell me what that monster is going to do with my clothes.' `Sell them, of course,' replied Gordon. `That is what she carried you off for: To get your clothes.' `And you will take me home now?' `I don't know where your home is. I'll take you to a house where you can stop to-night and in the morning I'll find out where your father lives and take you to him.' Thus the burglar went on to fill the heart of the poor child with vain hopes, as he conducted him along many different streets, until he came to a disagreeable court, leading out of Purchase street, near the Sailor's Home. This place is known to the citizens in that quarter of the town as Spear's Alley, and it is one of those by-places in the midst of a great city, where poor families huddled together on account of the cheapness of the rents. 3 `You ain't going to leave me in any of these houses?' said the boy, shuddering. `For a day or two, perhaps,' replied Gordon, leading him into a small yard, through which he was obliged to pass to gain entrance to the house it was his purpose to visit. Mrs. Craft was a widow woman, residing at No. 5, who managed to support herself and children—she had two—by doing any little jobs, it mattered little what, that fell in her way. Professionally, she was a washerwoman, but we have no hesitation in saying she did a better business by dealing with such men as Gordon, than at her legitimate trade. She was a small, crooked, sharp featured woman, with a cast in her eye that gave to her the appearance of looking at you and your shadow at the same time. Gordon took Mrs. Craft aside and talked to her confidentially for some time, when, returning to Robert, he said to him:— `This is a good woman who has promised to take care of you until I can find where your father lives and carry you to him.' Robert looked first at Gorden, then at the woman, and finally glancing, at his torn and faded garments burst into tears. `I hope you'll find him soon,' he said, `but I'd thank you to bring my own clothes first, for I'm ashamed to be seen in such a mean, nasty dress as this! Will you bring my own clothes soon?' Gordon made no reply, but hurried away, leaving Robert alone with his new acquaintance. CHAPTER XV. The Stratagem. From the residence of Mrs. Craft, No. 5 Spear's Alley, Gordon hastened back to his own quarter of the town. Instead of returning to his abode in Centre street, however, with a pious dread of Margaret Munson's angry tongue, he resolved to visit his boon companions at the grog-shop in Ann street, into which we have already introduced the reader. At that good natured and respectable establishment he found many of his gay acquaintances assembled, several of whom were present on the night he lost such sums of money to the man in green glasses. These he had not seen since the time when they witnessed his ill-luck at play, and the remembrance of the passion he had showed on the occasion caused him to enter their presence with a sort of shame. `Ha! ha!' laughed the worthy proprietor of the place, as Gordon, to keep up appearances, offered to treat one of his particular friends.—`Here is one of our monied men; one of our golden 'ristocrats. I don't believe there's any bottom to his purse at all. Do you want to try your hand at cards again to-night?' `I'll play with anybody but the devil,' muttered Gordon. I tell you, that Marvin is a very fiend to gamble with. I do believe there is some magic in the way he cuts or deals the cards; for you may hold ever so good a hand, he's sure to hold a better, and you may spot ever so high on a trick, he'll be sure to spot a little higher and take it up. I'm willing to play with anybody but him— or the devil himself.' `By dam!' exclaimed a smooth voice close to his ear, `I will play wiz you and I care no more devil as youself. You come wiz me, Monsieur, and I give you ye shance of to win one, two, three hundred dollar.' `And who the devil are you?' demanded Gordon, gruffly. `Zat is my own affair Monsieur,' replied the Frenchman; `but you come wiz me, and you shall learn zat I am one zhontleman ver' honorabl'. Do you come? bien?' `Yes, by —!' replied Gordon, fiercely. `But look you, Monsheer, if this is a trap for me of any kind, I'll cut your heart out, sure as there's a devil in hell. Now, lead on, and I'll follow to the house you want to play in, if it is any reasonable place. But mind what I told you.' `Certainemong, Monsieur,' returned Louis, with the same calm, sober expression of countenance he always wore. And forthwith, accompanied by the burglar, he issued into the street. `Now, where the devil are you going?' demanded Gordon. `I show you,' replied Louis, `quicker you I can explain.' And this was all Gordon could get from him on the subject. However, he resolved to follow him,and learn the end of the adventure feeling perfectly safe, and in no danger from traps. Still, as Louis continued to conduct him toward the most respectable quarter of the city, the burglar began to feel like getting beyond his depth, and more than once reminded Louis of his threat. The only an swer he received on such occasions were simply, `Very good,' or `certainemong, Monsieur,' which afforded him but little satisfaction on the point in question. Thus the two kept on, Louis leading the way, until they arrived in front of Burnam's hotel. The valet de chambre would have entered without hesitation, but Gordon paused, shrugging his shoulders. `What 'ave you?' asked Louis. `That!' answered Gordon briefly, showing the hilt of a dirk he carried with him. `Now go on and—remember!' The look of terrible meaning the burglar cast at the valet de chambre would have startled any man of weaker nerves than Louis, who was altogether immovable by threats. He went on, and introduced Gordon into one of the apartments of his master. It was a richly furnished room, the splendor of which caused the burglar's eye to sparkle with avarice. `I must lock you in here,' said Louis, coolly. In an instant the right hand of Gordon clutched the handle of his dirk, and he glared revengefully at his stranger guide. `You see,' continued the valet de chambre, cool as if nothing had happened, `I must go out a minute for some money to play; and I must lock you in here zat you may not run off—' `Call somebody to stay with me then, if you're afraid of that,' growled the burglar; `I'll not be locked up by any body.' `Very good,' said Louis. `We will not play you.' Gordon reflected a moment. `Go on then,' he muttered sullenly.— `Lock me up, but mind that you come back soon.' Louis quietly left the apartment, turning the key upon the burglar. During the absence of the valet de chambre, Gordon busied himself in staring about the room, and making professional observations on the situation of the apartments, and on the dimensions of divers keys belonging to locks he longed to open. Upon the table was a small box of rosewood, of curious workwanship, which looked so tempting that he could not resist the desire he had to open it. The key was in the lock, and Gordon, quick as thought, gave it a professional turn, which placed the contents of the box at his mercy. He listened to see if there were footsteps approaching, then carefully raised the lid. A deafening explosion followed, and flame and smoke burst from the box. Gordon was unhurt, but he started back aghast. Before the burglar could recover from the amazement into which the unlooked for explosion threw him, the door was opened, and there entered—not Louis, but a stranger. Gordon clutched the handle of his knife, and threw himself into a posture of defence, while Burnam—for he it was—fixed his stern eye upon him as he advanced into the room. `What is the meaning of this?' demanded Gustavus. `Who are you?' `What right have you to question me?' retorted Gordon. `Do you know that you are in my apartments?' asked the other, sternly. `I care little whether I am or not,' answered the burglar, smiling. `I was conducted here by one d—d Frenchman, who shall suffer for this if I find it to be a trap.' `Did he give you liberty to be prying into boxes?' `I took that liberty.' `Very well; and I take the liberty now of saying to you that the Frenchman you have mentioned is a man in my employ; that he has acted in accordance with my orders; and that if you offer him the shadow of an injury, you shall dearly repent it.' Gordon could not but quail before the stern look of Gustavus, but yet he had the audacity to attempt to laugh at his threat. It was a ghostly laugh, however, and the hand of Gordon, that griped the hilt of his dirk, trembled in spite of his boasted strength of nerve. `You do not know that you are in my power?' pursued Burnam. Gordon answered with the same ghostly attempt at a laugh. `You have no idea, I suppose, that I could throw you into prison to-morrow!' `No!' muttered the burglar, a shade paler than before, `nor can you.' `You do not know me then?' `I'm sure I do not.' `Well, I'm the man you attempted to rob a short time since, in the vicinity of a gentleman's house of the name of Acton.' `Burnam!' `That is my name?' Gordon shuddered, but soon regained in part his self-possession, and armed himself with his accustomed audacity. `I heard of your robbery,' he said, `but you are mistaken in the man.' `I have the proofs of your guilt,' returned Burnam with a smile of cool contempt;— `and that is not the only crime you have committed to my knowledge, Mr. Gordon.' `Impossible!' exclaimed the startled burglar. `Who attempted to rob Mr. Acton's house!' asked Burnam. Gordon became paler still, and more agitated even than before. `I can prove those crimes against you, and others of greater magnitude. Can you inform who stole Mr. Acton's child this very night—' `I did not!' exclaimed Gordon in a husky voice. `Nor do you know the villain I suppose, who led the boy, dressed in rags, to a miserable house, in a place called Spear's Alley?' Gordon looked at Burnam as if he had been the arch-fiend himself. `What more do you know about me?' he demanded, after a pause. `Much—more, I believe than any other man alive, one excepted. I know who you are, what you have been, and what there is great danger of your becoming. You will understand me when I say I know the mystery of the power you have over Mr. Acton—' `Liar!' hissed the excited barglar; `you know nothing—you—' `Silence!' exclaimed Burnam, as if he were talking to a dog that had disobeyed him. `Another such word as that, and I make use of the knowledge I possess. On the contrary, if you would escare punishment for certain crimes I need not mention, let me advise you to be frank with me, and submit without a word to my orders. It is not probable Mr. Acton will be foolish enough to let you extort any more thousands from him, so the best thing you can do is to accept my offer of friendship.' `First,' said Gordon, leaning against the wall for support—such was his agitation— `first tell me who you are, and prove to me that what you say is true.' `Very good,' said Burnam, `you shall know who I am. You may perhaps have heard of a person who, some years ago, was charged with the murder of one Caleb Crowl—' The blood rushed back upon Gordon's heart, as if Burnam had spoken his doom He stared at Gustavus with eyes starting from their sockets, and features as pale as death. `You recollect the circumstance, I see,' continued Burnam with a bitter smile.— `Well, I am the man condemned to be hung for the murder of that Crowl.' `You—that man—you—' gasped the burglar. `I am Charles Chivers!' said Gustavus, calmly. Gordon stared at him fixedly. `Charles Chivers!' he repeated in a whisper. `I see—I know you now—' `And fear me, too,' I see!' added Gustavus—for we shall continue to call him by his assumed name — `why, you tremble as if you were the escaped convict—the man accused of murder! I wonder,' he added with a bitter smile, `if you had anything to do with putting that wretch, Crowl, out of the way!' `Have done with this raillery!' exclaimed the burglar, gruffly. `You know me, and there is no need of dallying thus with me. You need not speak to tell me how I have wronged you either,' he added, `for I confess all; but tell me quickly what you want of me, and I will serve you if it is in my power.' The burglar spoke with courage and resolution, for having recovered from the consternation into which Burnam's revelations had thrown him, the thought of his own guilt, and the power of the man he had wronged, made him desperate. `You have spoken wisely,' said Gustavus, `You have been instrumental in causing me much misery—nay, you have, in one sense, changed my destiny—but I promise now that all shall be forgiven, and pass unpunished, provided you make a full confession of your guilt, under oath, and remain with me, subject to my orders, for one week more or less, as circumstances may require. What say you?' Gordon reflected but a moment, then answered firmly— `I will serve you for two reasons. One is, I have done you wrong enough; then, again, it is for my interest to stand by you now. Charles Chivers, I am your man!' CHAPTER XVI. The Search and the Reward. HE CAN do what he likes with the brat!' exclaimed Meg Munson, sullenly, as Gordon left the house bearing Robert in his arms. `I've done my part, and shan't trouble myself any more about the matter.' In the course of half an hour, however, the old woman changed her mind; and as Gordon did not return, she began to think it would be full as well for her to know what had become of the stolen child. Another hour passed, and still Gordon did not appear. Meg was beginning to grow impatient. At last there was a sound of footsteps on the stairs. Meg had her mind made up to give Gordon a severe lecture, but it chanced that the comer was not Gordon. The man in green glasses entered. The old woman knew him and asked him what he wanted; at the same time shoving a chair towards the spot where he remained standing. `Where's Gordon?' he asked. `The devil knows better than I do,' returned Meg. `What do you want of him?' `I want to see him on my own business,' answered Marvin. `Ha! ha!' laughed the old woman. `You want to win the rest of his money, I suppose. Very well. Hunt him up, and you are welcome to every penny you can get out of him.' `There he comes,' returned Marvin, with a smile of cool satisfaction, as he heard footsteps mounting the stairs. `That is not his step,' said Meg, not a little startled. `Who can it be?' Marvin hastily concealed himself in the corner occasioned by the cupboard and the wall, where the dim lamp failed to penetrate with its dismal light, and drew the folds of an old dress, that hang upon a nail, over his face and chest. The visitor entered. It is impossible to say which was the most startled at sight of the pale features of the new comer, the old woman, who looked him full in the face as she sat with her back to the light, or Marvin, who looked cautiously through his green glasses from the dark nook in which he was concealed, until the ashy countenance of the visitor met his view. With a start Marvin drew the dress over his eyes, and shrunk back into the shadowy corner, while Meg, confused and alarmed, sprang to her feet. The visitor was Mr. Acton. Having learned where Gordon lived, and firmly believing that the villain had been instrumental in stealing his child, Mr. Acton had ventured to go alone in the night directly to the residence of the burglar, in hopes of finding his son. Meg recognized him at once, and trembled at the possibility of his recognizing her. Thanks to her dress, and the imperfect light in the room, Acton was not aware that he had ever seen her before. `One Gordon lives here I believe,' said he, after casting his eye about the room. His voice was low but earnest, and Meg felt compelled to make answer in the affirmative. `Can I see him?' `He is not at home.' `Has he been out long?' `It is about two hours since he left,' replied the old woman. She saw that Mr. Acton had no suspicions of her, and satisfied that the child had been traced to her house, she thought she might as well tell the truth about Gordon, as to make up a story for the occasion. `Do you expect him soon?' continued Mr. Acton. `He may not be here to-night,' replied Meg, anxious to drive him away. Having removed towards the centre of the room, Mr. Acton once more cast his eyes about him, and perceived in the exact spot where Marvin was concealed, what struck him forcibly as being the outlines of a man's lower extremities. Marvin, meanwhile, saw with no little trepidation, as he looked through a rent in the garment before his face, the visitor approaching him, and riveting his searching eyes upon his uncovered feet. There was but one way to escape discovery, and that Marvin resolved boldly to adopt. As Acton's hand was extended to lift the garment that concealed his features, Marvin burst from his hiding place, tore down the old dress and threw it over Mr. Acton's eyes, and dashing across the room, extinguished the light before Mr. Acton could cast a single glance at his face. The room was in total darkness. Mr. Acton sprang forward to grasp the fugitive, but Marvin was upon the stairs before his pursuer reached the door. `Strike a light, quick!' cried Mr. Acton, as he dashed against the wall in the darkness, and went staggering across the room. Meg fumbled about the room for some time, and at last succeeded in lighting the lamp. `Was that Gordon?' demanded Mr. Acton, grasping her arm. `No,' answered Meg, sharply. Mr. Acton, anxious to clear up the mystery, and to find his child, pressed the old woman to speak frankly, and tell him all she knew of Gordon's late transactions, but finding her obstinate in her refusal to tell him more than he already knew, he reluctantly left the house. It was late when Mr. Acton reached home. His wife, agitated by the events of that afternoon, was alone in her room, awaiting his return. Mr. Acton entered; their eyes met; and in the look of both was the anxious inquiry, `Has the child been found?' And the expression of hopeless grief, anxiety and fear that followed, was the only reply. `Our friends,' said Mrs. Acton, `have made thorough search in every direction, far and near, but the poor boy is no where to be found. God grant that the morning may bring some intelligence of what has become of him!' But the morning came, and still there was no news of the absent Robert. In the forenoon the search was continued with the same success as on the night before. There was now no longer any room to hope that the child had not been stolen. Before the night again set in it was known that Mr. Acton had offered a reward of one thousand dollars for the restoration of his son. It was not until the day following that Meg Munson saw the announcement, in print, of the boy's disappearance, and of the sum that would be paid to any one who would bring him back safely to his parents; and that announcement served only to fire her avaricious heart with uncontrollable passions. Like the hungry wild beast that is allowed the sight and smell of flesh he cannot reach, she was wrought into a fury. That golden reward she could not claim. `Ye fiends!' she muttered through her teeth set with rage, `assist me to find the child! Bring Gordon back to me, if it is with a rope around his neck!' She had not heard from the burglar since the hour of his disappearance, when he car ried Robert away in his arms; and what he had done with the boy Meg Munson could not divine. She raved like a maniac. After originating the plot himself, and stealing the child, to have him stolen from her, and the reward withheld from her hands, was maddening in the highest degree to an avaricious nature like hers. In the midst of her trouble she knew not whom to apply to for assistance. As she was considering the practicability of letting some of her associates in crime into the secret and requiring their aid, she was visited by an old acquaintance of the reader. It was three o'clock in the afternoon that Light Joe came swaggering up the stairs. `Where's Gordon?' he asked. `Bless us!' exclaimed Meg, `I was just going to you to see if you couldn't tell me what has become of him. If you don't know—' `I know? Lor'! I havn't seen him in an age!' `Then he is gone to the devil; that's all!' `Very probable.' `I wish I had him beneath my feet!' growled the old woman striking her hand with her brawny fists. `Why, my dear Meg, what's the matter?' asked Joe. The old woman fixed her basilisk eyes upon his face, and grasping his arm, said in a passionate whisper, `I formed the plan—I stole the child myself—I brought him here—and now Gordon has carried him off, and will he get the reward.' `The reward!' echoed Joe. `Mr. Acton,' pursued the old woman, slowly and distinctly, `has offered one thousand dollars—' `For the child?' `Yes; for as worthless a thing as that;— and now that the reward is to be had,' added Meg in the bitterness of her anger,— `neither Gordon nor the child can I find!' `What can I do for you?' asked Joe. `Find Gordon!' `Where shall I look for him?' This was a question the old woman could not answer. She at last told him to go to Kate, and learn if she had heard from either Gordon or the child. `Why don't you go yourself?' asked Light Joe. Meg related the events of the evening when Mr. Acton visited her, and replied that she feared being recognized. Under such circumstances, Joe promised to go himself to visit Kate. It was not without some scruples that the young burglar ventured upon ground he had trod in the capacity of house-breaker, being impressed with the possibility of such a thing as detection; but he was a brave youth, and shaking off all foolish fears, he boldly called for Kate at Acton Hall. He found her very pale and very sad. `What ails you?' asked Joe, when they were alone. `I know you'll think me very weak, dear Joe,' she replied, brushing away a tear, `and you will laugh at me perhaps when I tell you.' `Let's hear it,' said the young burglar, kindly. `Had it been a mere robbery,' pursued Kate, `I shouldn't have cared; but to think I have helped rob them of a child—a dear and only child!' And the poor girl sobbed aloud. `Fie, fie!' exclaimed Light Joe, with an attempt at a laugh; (he brushed away a tear, however, as he spoke,)—it ain't all your fault. Besides, they'll get the boy again soon.' `That is possible; but to see such an agony of grief and suspense they are in now,' sobbed Kate; and to think I was the cause of it, after they have been so kind to me!' It seemed that the poor girl's heart would break beneath its load of sorrow and self-reproach. `Do they suspect you?' asked Joe. `Suspect me? no!' replied Kate, `I wish they did, for it would not make me feel so bad as it does to have them think my sadness now all arises from pure sympathy with them. `Kate,' said Joe, with more feeling than was his wont, `you are a better girl than I believed you once. You are too good for the life you lead, by far. You have a kind heart, and I love you far better for it. I swear never to tempt you to do wrong again as I live, and I will reform myself, if I can conveniently. Then, dear Kate, we will be married, and try to live honestly. Mine is a ticklish profession, and I hate it.' `Dear Joe,' said the girl, `dont you think people are happier when they are honest and virtuous? I do—in fact, I know they are happier. Oh! I would give worlds of wealth if I was as innocent and happy as I once was!' Kate covered her face with her hands, weeping bitterly; Joe brushed away a second tear that glistened in his eye, as if half ashamed to be seen there, and drawing Kate gently to his bosom imprinted a fond kiss upon her lips. Then, with a strange feeling in his heart, such as he had seldom experienced before, he hastened back to town, to inform Meg that he could hear nothing of Gordon. CHAPTER XVII. The two Suitors. THAT evening Mr. Acton received a note from Gustavus Burnam, in which that gentleman apologized for not having called on his family or written to him before, saying that he had been prevented by circumstances he could not well explain; he also spoke very feelingly concerning the recent loss of their child, and ended by extending an invitation to Mr. Acton and his lady to take dinner with him on the following day. Mr. Acton would have accepted the invitation without hesitation, but Maria, knowing now with whom they had to deal, and fearing some terrible outbreak when Burnam should make himself known to her husband as Charles Chivers, did all in her power to dissuade him from his purpose. However, as she could not advance any tangible reason for not accepting the invitation, and feared awaking her husband's suspicions, she yielded at last, and it was resolved that on the following day they should take dinner with Mr. Burnam in town. As Gustavus merely wished Mr. Acton to remember him to Edith Irving, and did not extend the invitation to her, she was left alone on the afternoon in question. Her sister and Mr. Acton went to Boston at an early hour, and she had all the afternoon before her, which looked long and tedious in the prospect, as she thought of the enjoyment they would experience in the fascinating society of Gustavus Burnam. Edith Irving had much to occupy her mind besides that which related to the whole family. True, her personal anxieties had been wholly absorbed of late in her sympathy with Mr. Acton, and Maria for the loss of their only child, but yet on the afternoon in question, when she was alone, her thoughts would revert to her private perplexities. Two young men of equal standing in society, of equal talents as near as she could judge, and of apparently equal worth, bestowed upon her attentions of too marked a character, for her to consider them as merely on the ground of friendship. They were both very agreeable to her, but before she allowed her affections to centre on either of them, she candidly weighed the question in her own mind— `Which is the worthier?' Dr. Frederick Farley—the Rev. Mr. Everett—which should she choose? She had known the clergyman the longest, and his claims had been presented first. She felt that she could love him passionately did she but allow her affections to go out to him, and this decided her in his favor. She had given neither of her suitors a final answer as yet, and she was debating in her mind how she could do this with the most delicacy, when a visitor was announced. It was no other than Frederick Farley, whom she had resolved to reject. The young doctor called, he said, to learn if anything had been heard of Robert; to see how Mrs. Acton's health withstood the shock of his loss; and to perform many other little neighborly duties, which was very natural and very kind in him to do; but any person with half an eye would have seen at once, by a certain confusion in his appearance, that he was thinking more of Edith than of her sister, or of her sister's child. In fact, Frederick, who had desired an opportunity of speaking with Edith alone, on a subject we need not name, was glad to find her, on the present occasion, disengaged, yet he suffered not a little embarrassment on finding himself subject to the full fire of those eyes he so much admired. We need not weary the reader with details of the manner in which Frederick introduced the subject he longed to speak with her upon, nor depict the embarrassment of both parties when he asked her to pronounce the significant monosyllable on which his destiny hung. `Could she love him?' `No.' Kindly and feelingly; but it was not the less a decisive answer—`no!'—she could not love him except as a highly respected friend; and what consolation was that to an impassioned nature like his own?' Frederick had recovered his self-possession when Edith gave him her final answer, and great as was the effect it had upon him, he succeeded in preserving his calmness to an admirable degree, and thanking her for her frankness, he expsessed a wish that the circumstance might be forgotten, and that they might be friends to each other as they had been before. She said it should be as he desired; but are such circumstances easily forgotten. After Frederick had gone, Edith, remembering how very pale he was when he took his leave, and how agitated by emotions he endeavored to suppress, knew that he must love her well, and half regretted her refusal. It was a sad half hour Edith Irving spent —that immediately following Frederick's departure. Alone, she now longed for some friend with whom to converse, that her mind might be diverted from its gloomy reflections. Whilst her feelings were in this state, Kate had occasion to enter the room. She was going out again directly, when Edith, remarking how pale and sad she looked, called her back. `What has happened to cause you sorrow?' she enquired, taking the girl kindly by the hand. `Nothing—not much—' stammered Kate, turning away. `And yet you are very sad. Ever since the night Robert disappeared—' Kate's pale features suddenly became crimson. `Can it be,' pursued Edith, `that his loss alone makes you so melancholy?' Kate made no answer, for she could not lie, and she dared not tell the truth. Edith urged her; kindly, yet with firmness. `Oh!' sobbed Kate, unable longer to restrain her feelings—`I am such a bad girl!' And she wept like a child. `My dear Catherine,'—Edith spoke with much feeling, her own tears flowing the while—`something troubles you of late.— Why not confide in me? Tell me your griefs, and I doubt not but I can do something for you—console and comfort you at least. Speak freely now, Catherine, let what will be the matter. I know you are not bad by nature, and if you have been guilty of faults, I can forgive them in one like you.' `You don't know how bad I have been— how bad I am!' murmured Kate, still sobbing. `Oh! you would despise me as I deserve.' `Not if you are repentant, surely,' said Edith, in tones so kind that, while they made Kate weep more violently than before, caused her heart to yearn towards her companion, and to love her as if she had been her guardian angel. `Think rather that I would give you the advice and consolation of a friend,' added Miss Irving. Kate raised her head, and brushing away the hot tears that streamed down her cheeks, looked for a moment full in the face of her companion; it was a look full of earnest entreaty, gratitude and timid hope—one that seemed to read the soul of Edith, to learn if she could indeed confide to her the secrets of her heart. `Tell me your history,' urged Edith, as Kate once more bowed her face upon her hands. `Let me know who you are and what you have been?' `I have been virtuous as you,' sobbed Kate. `I don't doubt it.' `But I was thrown in the way of temptation—' `Well.' `Oh! it is a sad tale,' murmured Kate. `Go on,' said Edith, kindly. `I am an orphan—' `Poor girl!' thought Edith, but strongly pressed Kate's hand to encourage her to go on.' `I have lived with my aunt since I was quite young. She is a bad woman, for it is through her that I was ruined.' `Ruined! through her influence!' `Yes, alas! I was earning my bread by honest labor, and we were very poor, when one evening I received a letter.' `A letter?' `Yes—and I have kept it till now, in remembrance of him who wronged me. I always carry it here.' And Kate drew from her bosom a worn and faded letter, which she gave to Edith. It read as follows: `Dearest girl— `Although we are unknown to each other, I love you. When and where I have seen you, I need not explain, but I have beheld you often, and never without longing to speak with you, and to make known to you the sentiments of my heart. Excuse this mode of addressing you, and grant me an interview to-night at your own house. Richard Marvin. `And you received him by request?' said Edith. `Yes—but not from my own choice,' replied Kate. `I should not have noticed the letter, but my aunt said I ought to know who Mr. Marvin was before I passed judgment upon him, and absolutely commanded me to receive him that night. I did so—I found him agreeable—more of a gentleman than any man I ever knew. I suspected nothing, but invited him to call again. He came to see me frequently for a long time making both my aunt and me rich presents My aunt believed him wealthy. She was avaricious, intriguing and unprincipled.— Her influence over me was fatal. I had learned to love Mr. Marvin, and to confide in him. I believed his fair promises. I could not think he would even desert me. Oh! then I had a double temptation to overcome—nay, the temptation was three-fold. When he was away my aunt poisoned my soul with her own immoral principles; and he, with the cunning of the serpent, let no opportunity pass of inspiring me with voluptuous dreams of guilty pleasure. Added to this was the natural sinfulness of my own nature to be resisted—my own selfishness and my own passions.' `No wonder that you fell!' exclaimed Edith, in a tone of pity Kate bid her face in her hands, and for a moment neither spoke nor moved. `Go on,' said Edith, kindly as before. `Would you believe me?' murmured Kate. `That man who professed to love me so, betrayed me, and deserted me!' `As men too often do!' exclaimed Edith. `You are one of thousands—but you are better than many unfortunate ones, for there is much goodness still remaining in your heart, while the greater part of those who fall, are plunged into ruin inevitable, and instead of repenting and reforming, became more depraved than ever.' `It was so with me, alas!' sighed Kate. `I became as bad as it is possible for a creature to become. I associated with the worst of my own sex, and with the criminal and guilty of the other.' `But now you regret it?' `How bitterly do I!' `And would become virtuous once more?' said Edith. `Miss Irving,' replied Kate, earnestly; `if I had all the wealth of this world at my command, I would give it to blot out the past from my memory, and become as pure in heart and happy as I once was!' `And what hinders you?' asked Edith. You have been frank with me, and have put confidence in my friendship, and you shall not be disappointed in your trust. I will assist you, Catherine; you shall live with me, and I will be your friend rather than your mistress. I promise you, if you are virtuous, you shall be happy. Associate with the vicious no more, but live a life of innocence and peace.' Thus Edith went on to pour sweet words of consolation into Catherine's ears, and by her sympathy and kindness, to awaken in her heart stronger sensations of joy she had never felt before. `One thing,' said Kate, after a long pause, `I now feel compelled to confess to you. If I die for telling it to you, you shall know a secret that may save you much sorrow and regret. This Marvin—I should have told you that he is one of those who delight in vice for its own sake; who, while they are able to move in the first society, often seek out the company of the low and degraded out of choice.' `Well?' `You know him!' Edith started. `I know no one by that name,' she said, after a pause. `But he has another name.' `What is it?' `It is a name you respect,' said Kate; a name that will startle you when you hear it.' `Speak!' `It is the Reverend Mr. Everett. CHAPTER XVIII. Revenge. MEANWHILE, Mr. Acton and Maria were in the company of Gustavus Burnam. The dinner, which was served up in the most sumptuous style, had been partaken of by Mr. Burnam and his two visitors, and the three had withdrawn to an apartment furnished with the greatest elegance and simplicity of taste. Thus far Gustavus had succeeded in entertaining his guests in the most agreeable manner. His brilliant conversational powers, and his polite and fascinating manners were never better appreciated than by Mr. Acton and his lady on the present occasion. To Maria, Gustavus was very attentive, and she appeared so sensitive in his presence, and so to admire the man, that Mr. Acton, little dreaming what was the true cause of her visible confusion, and to feel not a little jealous of Mr. Burnam's fascinations. `I have chosen this occasion, Mr. Acton,' said Gustavus, after the conversation had run for some time on general subjects, to make known to you a secret that will surprise you not a little.' Mrs. Acton anticipated what was coming, and shrank back in her chair, pale with agitation, while her husband regarded Burnam with a look expressive of interest alone. `The secret relates to my own history,' pursued Gustavus, `a portion of which I have a desire to relate to you.' `You do me an honor,' remarked his guest. Burnam smiled as he went on. `You have no idea perhaps of ever having seen me before?' `No,' replied Mr. Acton, astonished at the question. `My features, then, have undergone a surprising change,' said Burnam, `else your memory of persons is poor.' Mr. Acton looked at him earnestly. His color changed, for memory began to recall the image of one, who bore, he thought, a slight resemblance to Gustavus, and whom he would not have met for the world. `You do not remember me?' asked Burnam, with a strange smile. `Look again!' Acton looked again, and recognized him then! It was with fearful agitation that, with forced calmness, and in a low, husky whisper, he murmured— `You are—Charles Chivers!' `The same,' said Burnam, coolly.— `Charles Chivers, whom you know before he was condemned to be hung for the murder of Caleb Crowl.' Mr. Acton glanced at his wife, whom he beheld pale and motionless as if suddenly changed to marble, then fixed his eyes once more on his host, who was smiling at the consternation he had caused. `Is it possible!' exclaimed Mr. Acton, recovering a portion of his self-possession.— `I was not prepared for this!' He turned away to avoid the piercing look Gustavus gave him, and in a moment he had resolved on the course to pursue. `Maria,' said he to his wife, `let us begone. We have been deceived in this man. Recollect he's an escaped convict—that he is a murderer!' `You will not go yet,' said Burnam, with the same calm, strange smile. `When old acquaintances met like this, they should not part so suddenly. Be seated, and hear what I have to say.' Trembling with agitation, Mr. Acton continued standing, with his arms folded on his breast, in the centre of the room. `Speak quickly,' he said in the tone of one impatient to know the worst. `Yes, and briefly,' replied Gustavus.— `You may remember the circumstances on which my destiny has turned, but I will review them briefly, to refresh your memory. `Twelve years ago, Maria Irving had two suitors. One was rich and the other was poor; but the richer of the rivals was not the favored one. `The rich suitor was yourself, Mr. Acton; and you she refused. I, the poorer one in this world's goods, enjoyed her love, and was accepted. Well do I understand your rage, Mr. Acton, on finding yourself supplanted by one like me! `I was to be married to Miss Irving, when a strange and terrible event snatched her from me and gave her to you. `In the town where we lived, there also resided one Caleb Crowl. He was a rough, selfish, unfeeling man, who had done me some wrong, and whom I detested and hated with my whole soul. We were frequently thrown in each other's way, and once or twice we quarreled, and I had been heard to threaten him. Thus, I had two bitter enemies in the persons of Caleb Crowl and Henry Acton. `One day I met Crowl on the banks of the rapid stream which runs through the town. It was towards evening, and I did not recognize him until he accosted me, and then I should have passed him, had he not offered me a deliberate insult. Angry words passed between us, which were overheard by persons who were passing by all the time. We did not come to blows, but it was dark before we parted. I returned home, and thought no more of the matter until I was arrested for the murder of Crowl. `He had been killed, it was said, and I alone could have done the deed. I was seen with him last, near the very spot where there was found blood, and where his body had evidently been dragged on the grass to be thrown into the river. `Other circumstances, which I need not repeat, formed, together with this, sufficient grounds on which to arrest me and commit me for trial. `While I lay in prison, Maria Irving either could not or would not visit me; and before my trial came on, such efforts had been made by my rival, Mr Acton, to prejudice her against me, that it seemed she was firmly convinced that I was guilty of the horrid crime of which I was accused. `My trial came on; you remember that I was found guilty and sentenced to be hung. The belief in my guilt was general, and few pitied me. Yet I had friends who knew that I was innocent, and who felt it their duty to assist me to escape. I was bold and ingenious, and soon contrived a plan of effecting my escape, which required no open aid from any one. You remember, perhaps, the astonishment occasioned by the intelligence spread one morning that the cell of the convict, Chivers, was empty. `I was concealed by my friends in town for some time, when I made good my escape by flying to foreign lands. I changed my name; I have become wealthy; and now I am returned to seek vengeance for the wrong I have suffered.' `Or to be hung?' muttered Acton. `And for what?' demanded Gustavus, with a smile of cool contempt. `For the murder of Caleb Crowl!' `Which you know that I never committed! Out upon you!' `I will not dispute with you,' said Mr. Acton, turning away. `It is enough for me to say it was proved against you.' `And it is sufficient for me, then, to bring forward a stronger proof than any—a proof which the evidence of all the fiends combined could not set aside!' `What is it?' demanded Acton, fearfully agitated. Gustavus regarded him with a smile of withering contempt. `The proof,' said he, `that I did not murder Crowl is—that Crowl is still alive!' Mrs. Acton clasped her hands and started up, while her husband appeared for the moment ready to sink into the earth. Desperation often supplies us with cour age and presence of mind. Thus it was with Mr. Acton. `It is false,' said he, advancing boldly towards Gustavus. `Crowl is not alive.' Burnam smiled, but made no reply, as he threw open the door of an adjoining room, and revealed to the astonished eyes of Mr. Acton and Maria, the form and dark features of the so called Isaac Gordon. `Caleb Crowl stands before you!' said Burnam, as the burglar stalked into the room. `Caleb Crowl!' echoed Maria—`it is he! the man—the robber who terrified me so one night, because I thought him dead!' `I am that man!' said Gordon, with a grim smile. `The wretch!' muttered Mr. Acton, his ashy features distorted with rage. `This is a foul plot against me; but I will suffer it to trouble me no longer. Maria, come away.' `Not so fast,' replied Burnam. `Let us see if there is a plot; and if there is, let us know about it. Speak Caleb Crowl—or Isaac Gordon, if you prefer that name— speak and tell us if you know of any plot.' `I know of but one,' answered Gordon, as we shall continue to call him, `and that you and Henry Acton know as well as myself.' `But Mrs. Acton does not,' said Burnam. `Clear up this mystery to her, that she may know the true character of the man she has for a husband!' Mrs. Acton listened with intense interest, while her husband, unable to utter a word, stood apart, biting his lips and grinding his teeth with rage. `I may as well speak out now,' said Gordon, bluntly. `It is of no use to say I was never murdered, for people don't come to life again after that little ceremony has been performed on them once. But you'd like to know, perhaps, what became of me when it was given out that I had been killed and thrown into the river. There was blood found on the bank of the stream, it is true, but that was'nt my blood; and if my hat was found washed ashore farther down, it was no sign that I had gone to the bottom.' `Come to the point,' interrupted Burnam. `You see,' pursued Gordon, `all this had been contrived in order that Charles Chivers might be accused of the murder!' `What villainy!' murmured Mrs. Acton. `I know it—but it was done, on my part, for revenge. Yet I was not alone in it.— There was another eager to see the ruin and disgrace of Chivers.' `Who?' Gordon pointed to Mr. Acton. `It was to destroy a rival that Henry Acton offered me fifteen hundred dollars to disappear in the mysterious manner I did, and never to return to that part of the country again. I gained a double object in accepting the offer—the revenge and the reward. Having arranged everything in such a way that suspicions would fall upon Chivers without fail, I escaped from the country in the right time, and was far away when the report of any death was spread through the town.' `This is enough,' said Burnam. `My revenge is now complete, for Maria knows the character of the man, who won her by plotting to ruin me. I shall take no legal steps against you, Mr. Acton; I am satisfied with the assurance that I could have no sweeter vengeance than this:—HENCEFORTH YOU ARE DESPISED BY YOUR WIFE!' CHAPTER XIX. The Wounded Spirit. MR. ACTON had not the face to deny the assertions of Burnam and Gordon. He felt that he could not make his wife believe him innocent of the villainy she was charged with, and he knew how she despised everything of that description. Yet he had a hope that she would some day forgive him, and love and respect him as before. Without appearing to notice Gordon or Gustavus, more than as though they had not been there, he advanced and took Maria's hand. She withdrew it coldly, and turned to Burnam, who regarded her with a look of interest and pity. `I may never see you again, Charles,' she said in tones of deep earnestness, `so before we part, let me hear you say that you forgive me for ever suspecting your innocence, and for uniting myself with the man by whom you have been so foully wronged. Believe me, I was deceived. You know that I loved you onca and must know that my heart too was wrung by the villainy of which you were the victim. Oh! say that you forgive me!' Unable to restrain her feelings, Maria sank upon her knees before Gustavus, and covered her face with her hands. `I forgive you freely,' said Burnam, raising her gently from the floor. `We have been alike the victims of a villainous plot. But for him we might have been happy together, but as it is we must bid each other farewell. May Heaven bless you!' So saying, he drew her arm through his and conducted her to her carriage. `Adieu!' said he, as she took her seat within. `Adieu, Charles!' she murmured, `adieu!' And throwing herself back into the carriage, she burst into tears. Mr. Acton brushed by Gustavus without uttering a word, and getting into the carriage and taking his seat by Maria's side, ordered the coachman to drive away. Meanwhile Gordon was endeavoring to make out some half a dozen words Mr. Acton had taken an opportunity to write, with a trembling hand, upon a piece of paper, which he slipped into the burglar's hand as he passed out to his carriage. The words were as follows: `To-night—at nine o'clock—in the orchard—for your interest and mine—' Gordon had scarcely read this laconic but significant epistle, and put the paper in his pocket, when Gustavus entered. `I have no more use for you, Crowl,' said he. `As I promised you shall not be punished, through my influence, for any of your past offences, but you are at liberty to go where you please. Yet listen to a word of advice. Give up your dishonest profession, and earn your living lawfully, else you will meet with worse fortunes than heretofore. If I find you ready to reform, you may count upon my assistance; but if otherwise, I shall be the worst enemy you can have, for I shall have an eye upon you.' Gustavus rang for Louis, who appeared immediately. `Conduis cet homme a la porte,' he said to the valet de chambre; and to Gordon— `Good bye. When I hear from you again, let it be as an honest man. Gordon stammered something, but Gustavus waved his hand and Louis hurried him out of the room. Meanwhile, Mr. Acton's carriage was rolling along Washington street. Mr. Acton was seated by Maria's side, but as yet neither had spoken since they left Burnam's house. Their feelings we leave to the imagination of the reader, who cannot but picture to himself something of the agony by which their souls were racked. `Maria,' said Mr. Acton at length. Until now she had not looked at him nor noticed him in any way, more than as if he had not been there; but when he spoke, she raised her head, and turned her eyes, from which she had dried the tears, full upon his face. `Maria,' repeated Mr. Acton, shuddering at the look of icy coldness which she gave him, `why do you appear thus to me?' Mrs. Acton's pale features exhibited not the least emotion, and not a muscle moved as she answered in a tone of startling calmness. `I leave that question for your own heart to answer.' She turned away her eyes, so cold and so full of the silent eloquence of that sorrow which hath no hope, and not another word was spoken by her until she reached home. Mr. Acton made no reply to her last remark, but sat there by her side with his hands clenched together, his teeth set, and his features wrought into an expression of rage, hatred and angry disappointment. Truly had Burnam had his revenge, for Mr. Acton could have endured any thing better than the scornful indignation of her he loved so devotedly. And she despised him, and she felt that she must hate him! He dared make no attempt at an apology, for he knew her firm and lofty spirit too well to think she would forgive him easily. Arrived at his own house, Mr. Acton waited on his wife with the tenderest attention, for which she thanked him coldly, as she entered her own apartment. Mr. Acton was left alone. For an hour he paced hurriedly to and fro in his solitary chamber, muttering deep curses on Barnum, on Gordon, and on himself. Thus do our evil deeds, designed for the injury of others, turn in time against ourselves; and sin its own punishment. With angry impatience Mr. Acton waited for the hour of nine. Evening at length came on. He was still alone, pacing to and fro, and biting his lips in the bitterness of remorse and rage. Every five minutes he looked at his watch, cursing the slow-paced moments that dragged so wearily along. Scarce had the clock tolled nine when Mr. Acton was in the orchard, waiting for Gordon. It was a cold night, and billows of black clouds rolled across the sky, heaving in the gale, like the billows of the deep. Gordon appeared at length. The burglar was well armed, for knowing Acton's revengeful nature, he had good cause to fear his rage. The two men, facing each other, could see, by the uncertain light, the expression of each other's countenances. The one was of remorse, vengeance and despair, the other was of avarice, triumph and deceit. `Crowl,' said Mr. Acton, passionately; you are a damnable villain! After all your promises you have betrayed me!' `Not willingly,' said Gordon. That devil of a Chivers was too much for me. He got me into his power, and then I had the satisfaction of being told that he knew who I was, and had proofs of every piece of sly work I ever did. I was obliged to do as I do, or he would have sent me to rot in prison. As it was, he had me shut up in his own house until he had occasion to make use of me, which was to day.' `You have done me wrong, Crowl,' returned Mr. Acton, `but as you are a professed villain, I must let it pass. You would do almost anything for money, I believe!' `And you are not far out of the way! added Gordon with a grim smile. `Then we may still make it our interest to be friends,' said Mr. Acton. You know what cause I have to hate that Chivers?' `I think I do.' `And can probably guess what I want of you. I must have vengeance on him, and you are the man to serve me.' `I understand you,' replied Gordon; and he added in a whisper—`That Chivers must be put out of the way, eh?' `Whether by poison, powder or steel, I care not,' said Mr. Acton; `I leave that to you. Recollect, I have nothing to do with the deed—you and I don't even know each other; but when I hear of Chivers' death, the sum of twelve hundred dollars is yours.' `I understand you.' `Then begone, and let me not see your face again until I hear that you have earned your money!' Five minutes after, Gordon was hurrying back to Boston, and Mr. Acton was in the presence of his wife. His proud spirit was crushed, but yet he was not sufficiently humble to ask her to forgive him the wrong he had committed, She was civil to him, but very cold. `Maria,' said he, `it is not becoming in a wife to treat her husband in this manner.' `Once for all, let me say to you.' she answered in calm, firm tones, `that it is better for us to drop the subject which has occupied our minds this afternoon. We understand each other better now than we ever did before; and you must know my feelings. You are my husband, and as such I shall always endeavor to obey you, and to do nothing to cause you displeasure; and after what has passed, you can expect nothing more. I beg of you now to let this subject rest.' Acton bit his lips, but remained silent.— At last he said— `I am not sure, I understand you, madam; but if you mean to say that it is your intention to treat me henceforth as you do now, we cannot live together.' `That will be as you desire, answered Maria with the greatest indifference `I am anxious to do everything to please you, and you will find me ready to obey, whatever may be your commands.' `Shall we separate then?' demanded Mr. Acton in a tone of suppressed passion. Maria answered with the same imperturbable calmness as before— `That will be as you desire.' Mr. Acton looked at her fixedly for a moment; then with a smile—the first that had curled his lip that evening; and it was a 5 smile of bitter hate—he turned and left the room Mr. Acton did not close his eyes once, that night, to sleep, but all the time his brain was racked by indescribable torments occasioned by the various passions that possessed his soul. In the morning he threw himself upon a sofa, and enjoyed—if we may use the term—a short slumber, which was broken by hideous dreams. CHAPTER XX. Sorrows come not singly. Let us return to Edith When Kate made known to her that the man to whom she had resolved to give her entire heart—on whom she had determined to bestow her hand, as upon one she deemed worthy of all respect and love—when Kate told her that he, the Rev. Mr. Everett, a professed follower of Christ and a preacher of his word, was a black hearted hypocrite and a practiced villain, she was thunderstruck, stupified by the startling news. She dropped Kate's hand, which she had held in hers, and gazed at her so strangely with her piercing eye, that the poor girl shuddered with fear. `Oh, Miss Irving!' sobbed Kate, `forgive me for telling you—or for not telling you before—about Mr. Everett.' `You have done right,' said Edith, after a long silence. `But you are not deceiving me?' `How could I?' cried Kate. `You speak the truth, then?' `If ever I spake truth in my life! This Everett is the same man who ruined my innocence—the same who disguises himself so that many would not recognize him, and visits the haunts of vice, where he is known as Richard Marvin.' `I believe you now, for I recollect some circumstances which go to prove the truth of what you say,' returned Edith; but why have you not told me of this before?' `Because,' murmured Kate, `I met him one day in the hall, when he threatened to take my life if I exposed him. I was afraid to tell you.' `And have you no fears now?' `Yes—but if I knew he would strangle me for it, I could n't help telling you—you have been so kind to me.' `I thank you,' said Edith. `You shall not suffer for having done your duty. I expect this Everett here shortly. Stand by me then, and I shall be under great obligations to you.' Edith was calm—but oh! how much she felt! Her love and pride had received a terrible wound, but she had sufficient self-command to shut her sorrow up in her own breast. To think she had reposed confidence and centred her affections in a villain, turned all her love and joy to bitterness. Mr. Everett had promised to visit her that afternoon, and she expected him every minute. He kept his word; and when he arrived Edith had everything prepared for his reception. Edith was polite, though somewhat cold, while he on the other hand was more tender towards her than he had ever appeared before. `I am glad to see you,' said Edith. `Have the goodness to look at this paper, and tell me if you know that hand-writing.' She gave him the letter Kate had left in her possession. The characters were greatly faded, but at a glance Everett recognized his own hand-writing, and the truth flashed upon his mind. His villainy was discovered! Edith's piercing eye observed a momentary and almost imperceptible change in the countenance of the preacher, but in an instant the wonted color returned, and he raised his eyes to Edith with an expression of perfect coolness and unconcern. `This appears to be a love-letter,' said he, carelessly. `Nobody, I hope, has had the impudence to send such to you?' `I asked if you knew the hand-writing?' said Edith. `I am sure I do not.' `You never knew then an individual named Marvin—Richard Marvin?' pursued Edith with a searching look. She could perceive that Everett was a little disconcerted. However, he answered firmly and calmly that he knew no such man. `Who is he?' he asked. `I am told,' replied Miss Irving, `that he is a preacher like yourself, who bears a respectable character in high society, but who, in disguise, often visits the haunts of vice from the mere love of vice itself.' `I never heard of him before.' `Come this way,' said Edith. She approached a door leading into another apartment, threw it open, and discovered to the eyes of the clergyman the poor girl whom he had betrayed. `Did you ever hear of her?' asked Edith. `Never till I came here,' answered Everett, still unmoved. `It is false!' sobbed Kate. `Heaven knows you speak an infamous lie!' `What is the meaning of this?' asked the clergyman, turning to Edith. `This,' replied Edith; `that she has told a deliberate falsehood, which can avail her nothing, or that you are the man who penned this letter, which was sent to her by you.— You can deny the charge she brings against you, but if it is true, it will be readily proved; if false you can make your innocence appear. Until I am satisfied, let me not see your face again.' She left the room. The clergyman was alone with Kate. He looked cautiously about him at first, then approached the girl. `Shameless wretch!' he muttered through his teeth; have you forgotten my threat—or what I am? Did I not swear to be revenged if you exposed me? Now, by the Almighty! if you don't unsay all that you have said, and convince Miss Irving that I am not the man, you die within a week!' So saying, he shook her rudely, while she did nothing but sob and struggle to get free. His rage against her was so furious that he was tempted to tear her in pieces. Now I am satisfied!' Everet started at the sound of that voice and turned quickly about. Edith Irving stood before him, pale with indignation, and his dark eyes flashing with scorn. `Now I am satisfied,' she repeated, `that you are a villain. I need no stronger proof than this, Mr. Marvin. Heartless hypocrite! after ruining this poor girl, you threaten to destroy her bodily because she has had the courage to expose your villainy to me! But hear me before you take a single step. Promise never to enter this house again, and to leave this vicinity as soon as possible, and I give you my word that as far as I am concerned, there shall be no hindrance to your doing so honorably—to all appearances. I will not expose you publicly. On the other hand, if you seek my presence again, or if you linger near here, making dupes of a whole congregation of Christians who put confidence in you, or if you offer an injury, whether serious or slight, to this girl whom you have ruined, the world shall know of your villainy, and you shall be branded wherever you go. Remember my words and leave the house at once.' Everett would have spoken, but Edith was gone in an instant, and Kate had already disappeared. The clergyman's eyes flashed with revenge, but he opened not his lips. His whole scheme of marrying a wealthy and respectable lady had fallen to the ground, and he found himself exposed, and in danger of being publicly disgraced His anger knew no bounds, yet he dared not give it vent.— With a quick step he left the house. It was shortly after this event that Mr. Acton and Maria returned from Boston. It was not Edith's intention to whisper her discovery to even her sister, nor did she mean that her look should betray that any secret sorrow preyed upon her mind. If she did not look so cheerful as usual—her disposition was naturally gay—yet her brow was unclouded as she went to meet her sister. `Are you ill, Maria?' she asked. `You are very pale.' `I am not ill,' replied Mrs. Acton. `How did you enjoy yourself at Mr. Burnam's?' pursued Edith. `Do not question me now, sister,' returned Maria. `It was a fatal visit—you will never see Mr. Burnam in this house again.' `Indeed! why not?' `Because, Edith, henceforth he and Mr. Acton are mortal enemies.' Edith started with surprise. `What has happened?' `To-morrow you shall know the whole history,' replied Mrs. Acton. `But leave me alone to-night. I have need of repose to restore calmness to my mind, and to meditate on the course I ought to pursue.' Edith urged her no longer, but left her as she desired. On the following morning Mrs. Acton and her sister sat down to the breakfast table alone, not to partake of the food set before them, but to review the history of the past, and to advise with each other on what the future and the present required of them.— Maria told the secret of who Burnam was, and of her own husband's guilt, and Edith listened to the narration with all the interest and sympathy of a sister. Meanwhile Mr. Acton breakfasted alone, and set out for Boston at an early hour, without having spoken to his wife since the day before. The little sleep he had enjoyed had wrought a wonderful change in his appearance and feelings. All hope had passed, and he was sunk into the depths of despair. He felt weary of an existence which had no longer a charm for him. Every tie that bound him to earth was severed. He had lost his child and worse than lost his wife; and his self-respect was changed to remorse and self-contempt. He scarcely knew what he said—he was half insane. At noon he returned home. For three hours he was shut up in his room, where he occupied himself in writing. He had not eaten a morsel since the morning, when his breakfast consisted of a cup of coffee and a morsel of biscuit. The sun was going down, and his golden rays, melting richly on the dark brown woodland and hill-side of faded gray, penetrated the smoky October air and streamed through the window of his room. Mr. Acton sat gazing out upon the melancholy scene presented to his view, and the expression of his features became more calm than they had been before since his last interview with Burnam. And as the soft sunlight faded in the red October sky, he seemed looking his last farewell to the great luminary of the world. The day had gone out in the west, but its light still lingered on the earth. Mr. Acton then calmly arose, took a small neatly folded paper from his pocket-book, and emptied a powder it contained into a glass. Having burned the paper, he added a few spoonsfull of water to the powder, and without hesitation drank the whole. He then carefully washed the glass, and scrupulously destroying every trace of the fatal powder, drew a heavy sigh and threw himself upon a sofa, groaning under the weight of his despair. CHAPTER XXI. Crime's Recompense. After his last interview with Mr. Acton, Isaac Gordon—or Caleb Crowl, as the reader pleases—hastened back to Boston. Since the night on which he consigned little Robert to the safe keeping of Mrs. Crabb in Spear's Alley, he had been, until that afternoon, a sort of prisoner in the house of Gustavus Burnam, and he had not ventured near his agreeable companion, Meg Munson, after his release. Now, however, he was resolved to return home to cheer the heart of that respectable lady. It was late in the evening when he arrived in Centre street, and groped his way up the dark staircase leading to his beloved home. He found the door locked, but a dim light glimmered through divers crevices, proceeding from within. He shook the door, which hung loosely in its place, and shouted to Meg to give him admittance: `Who's there?' cried the shrill voice of that individual. `I—Gordon—don't you know me?' — shouted the burglar. `Come! let me in!' `You don't deserve to be let in at all,' muttered Meg, as she sullenly unfastened the door. `Where have you been?' `I've been where I couldn't help myself to get away,' replied Gordon; `it was a sort of prison.' `What have you done with the child?' demanded Meg. `I left him with mother Crabb, in Spear's Alley,' said the burglar. She promised to take good care of him until I called for him.' `And have you seen him since?' `No.' `You knew that a reward had been offered?' `Yes,' replied Gordon, rubbing his hands. It's a thumper, ain't it? We are sure of that Meg. I'll arrange things in the morning, so that the reward can be got without our being suspected of the theft.' Gordon could not sleep that night on account of two important projects that occupied his brain. Said he to himself— `First of all, I'll get the reward for the child, through some confidential friend who can steal it from Mrs. Crabb, and restore it to its friends without being suspected of having had anything to do with stealing it in the beginning. Afterwards, I'll put that devil of a Chivers out of the way, and get the twelve hundred Acton has promised me for doing that dirty piece of work.' After spending the greater part of the night in maturing his plans, Gordon dropped asleep, and did not awake until broad daylight on the following morning. Meg was still asleep. Without awakening her, he stole out of the house and directed his footsteps towards the residence of Mrs. Crabb. The citizens residing in Spear's Alley were already astir, and divers ragged children were gathering about the doors in that quarter. Gordon hastened on to No. 5, when he had the pleasure of meeting Mrs. Crabb upon the threshold. `What's the news?' said he. `How's the child I left with you?' Mrs. Crabb beeame very pale. The child—you left—' she stammered, `I am sorry to say—' `What?' demanded Gordon, fiercely; `he is not dead—' `No—but—' `Speak!' `He has run away!' Gordon uttered a curse of angry disappointment, and laid his hand roughly on Mrs. Crabb's shoulder, looking at her with an expression so full of revenge and hate that she trembled with fear. `You lie!' muttered the burglar, fiercely. `You have sold the child, or—' `As true as I stand here—' (as Mrs. C. spoke she was on the point of falling with affright)—as true as I stand here I don't know what has become of the child. He run away, and I can't find him no where!' `When was that?' demanded Gordon. `The very day after you left him here.' `But you promised to keep him in sight.' `I did, I know; but he slipped away; I can't tell how; but all at once, when I looked for him, he was gone.' After some farther parley, Gordon bestowing all sorts of maledictions on his old friend, Mrs. Crabb, left her and returned to Centre street. If he had been enraged at Mrs. Crabb, for the loss of the child, Meg was in turn furious in her imprecations against him.— He silenced her, however, by showing the handle of his dirk, accompanying the action with a dark, revengeful look, the meaning of which she could not but understand. After partaking of a hasty breakfast, the burglar left the house. Half an hour after, he was at the residence of Gustavus Burnam. `He is engaged,' said a servant; `you must call again.' Gordon went away, and three hours after made his appearance again. This time Burnam was not at home, and the burglar was told he would net return before evening. `Call at seven,' said the servant. Gordon was there again at the hour, and had the satisfaction of finding the gentleman of whom he was in search. He was shown into Burnam's apartment. `How now, Crowl?' said Gustavus, showing him a chair? You wished to see me. What can I do for you?' `Much,' said the burglar. `You can tell me, I suppose, what has become of the child I left at No. 5, Spear's Alley.' `Mr. Acton's boy, Robert?' `Yes.' `What should I know about him?' `He has disappeared,' said Gordon, soberly. `You are the only person that knew he was there, besides myself, and I mistrust you know what has become of him now.— You heard he was stolen from his parents an hour after that event took place, and then your servant watching for me to bring me here, saw me carry the boy to Spear's Alley. You promised that night that you would no betray me, nor give information where the child was; and now, if you have been the means of carrying him away, I ask it as a particular favor (Gordon laid great stress on these two words) that you should deliver the child into my hands once more.' `What object would it be for me to carry off the child?' asked Burnam with a smile. `That's it,' replied Gordon; `it can't be for your interest to have the boy, while the reward is an object for me; that's why I was so bold as to ask of you to give him to me again, if you had carried him off.' `Why should I carry him off?' asked Burnam; `do I want anything of the child myself? do I want the reward? or do I hold myself under obligations to do Mr. Acton a favor?' What could I do with the boy?' `Then you have not got him?' asked the burglar. `Nq.' Gordon's features wore an expression of disappointment and perplexity. `Yours is a thankless profession,' said Burnam with a smile. `You meet with many disappointments, no doubt, and are never safe.' `True—true!' `Why don't you try something better— something more worthy of a man?' `It is not in my power.' `Have I not offered to assist you?' `Yes; but you did not tell me how.' `Why,' said Burnam, `if you would only become an honest man, I would do more for you than you dream of. Promise me to reform, and I will begin to-night.' `I do mean to reform,' replied Gordon. `Then come with me this evening,' said Gustavus, `and I will introduce you to a man, who, if he finds you honest, will put you into the way of making your fortune.' `To-night?' said Gordon; and his heart bounded with joy when Gustavus answered in the affirmative, and added that he would go out with him in half an hour. They were to walk, and no one was to accompany them. `Now, then, for my work!' muttered Gordon. It was about eight o'clock in the evening when Gordon followed Burnam along some of the principal streets of Boston, and proceeded at length to a more retired portion of the city. There were no carriages passing, and their footsteps alone fell upon the pavement. The street lamps were not lighted, for there was a moon which shed its mellow light upon the city, when unobscured by the clouds that swept over the sky. Gordon walked on the left hand of Burnam, and close to his side, though a little behind. The right hand of the burglar grasped a dirk which he had concealed under his coat. Half a dozen times, with his mind made up to do the foul deed he meditated, had he clutched his weapon, ready to plunge it into the bosom of his companion, but each time, some movement on the part of Gustavus, or some trifling occurrence in the street, turned him from his purpose. At last Burnam, suspecting his design, suddenly tore open the burglar's coat, and discovered the weapon clutched by his brawny hand. `Ha!' laughed Gustavus, scornfully; `you would assassinate me, I see!' `Yes!' muttered Gordon. And in despair at finding himself detected, the burglar aimed a blow at Burnam's breast with a fierce and deadly purpose. Quick as thought Gustavus grasped his arm with his left hand, and with his right struck the ungrateful monster to the ground. Gordon was but an infant in the grasp of that powerful man. In an instant the dirk was wrenched from his hand, and his throat was beneath the heel of his adversary. `Arise!' exclaimed Gustavus. Slowly and painfully Gordon regained his feet. `I did not think you such a villain,' pursued his companion. `But I am prepared for you now. It is a dangerous undertaking te do good to man like you, for like an ungrateful cur you bite the hand that feeds you. Now follow me, as before; and know that an attempt to escape me, or to injure me, will be your death.' Without saying a word, the burglar followed Gustavus, in obedience to his own commands, like a crest-fallen slave. Soon they were passing along Commercial street, Burnam leading the way, yet keeping his keen, watchful eye upon the burglar. `You must go with me on board yonder vessel,' said Gustavus, as he conducted his companion across the street, towards a ship which lay alongside one of the long, broad wharves in that quarter of the town. `I think I will find a place for you where you will be compelled to be honest for a little while. Come along.' The two were passing along the wharf towards the ship, so near the water that they could hear the hoarse waves dashing against the stones and planks beneath them. All else was still around them, save the panting of the engine of a ferry boat that was crossing the river before them, and the voices of a crew of carousing sailors in the street near by. Gordon glanced into the dark water, and stepped still closer to Burnam's side. `He is off his guard now,' thought he. `If I could only push him off I might escape before he could get out of the water. Springing at Gustavus with all his might, he seized him and dragged him to the edge of the wharf, before he could bring his strength to bear against the burglar, who had him to a great advantage. But Burnam was quick and athletic. He planted his foot firmly in the ground, wheeled suddenly about, unclasping Gordon's hold at the same time, and hurled him from him with all his force. Gordon's foot tripped, and he was thrown headlong from the wharf. There was a heavy splash in the water beneath, and the burglar had disappeared. In a short time, however, he arose again to the surface, and east a look of agony at Burnam, who stood watching him from above. He could not swim, but flung his arms wildly about him, calling out for help, while the waves dashed over him and bore him down. At last he touched something— he grasped it with the eagerness of despair; but his efforts were vain. His hand touched nothing save the slippery side of a tall, dark vessel, under the bows of which he lay.— He gasped, shrieked, and beat the water in agony, but the waves sucked him down, and he sank to rise no more! CHAPTER XXII. A Change. IT IS MIDNIGHT. There are strange movements in Mr. Acton's house at this late hour. Pale faces, trembling hands and hurrying footsteps. What means it all? Upon a bed in a darkened room, lay the form of Henry Acton. He had been taken suddenly ill in the evening, and Frederick Farley had been sent for by his wife, without his knowledge. The young doctor arrived. He found Mr. Acton in great pain and growing rapidly worse. He was at a loss to know what ailed him, for Mr. Acton purposely deceived him, that he might not suspect the true cause of his sudden illness. Maria gave her husband her undivided attention, administering to his wants with the greatest care. Mr. Acton sometimes raised his eyes in agony to her face, to see if she looked tenderly upon him, and seeing her cold, pale features gliding by, or fixed by his side, he would clasp his hands and turn upon his pillow with a groan. Frederick, Maria and Edith were by his bedside. Mrs. Acton asked him if he was willing that other physicians should be sent for. `No,' said he, `I have reasons for saying no. You will understand them soon.' Shortly after he called his wife to his side. They were alone. `Maria,' said he, `I have not an hour to live. Nay, do not interrupt me, but hear me out. I have but a few words to say—I can say but few—and these will be briet.' `You are discouraged,' said Maria.— `This pain will last but a little longer, I trust, and then you will be better. `No,' said Henry. `Nothing can save me now. I am going fast. Give me your hand.' Maria put her hand in his. He pressed it convulsively. `You are the only person I ever really loved,' he murmured. `My parents—even my child, who is lost—possessed but little of my affection. But for you I should have been the most cold, selfish, miserable wretch on earth. I have always loved you devotedly, and to possess your affection and esteem has always been my chief aim in life. You can judge, then, of my despair on finding that you loathed and despised me!' `Henry—' `Don't interrupt me. Let me speak while I may. I confess that I have been guilty of a dark villainy, and that I have done you grievous wrong. But consider the cause of my treachery. What prompted me to deal with Chivers as I did? It was my love for you, which was so strong that I would have made any sacrifice—nay, have committed almost any crime to win you. It was a selfish love, but it was a true, compulsive and eternal love as well!' Mr. Acton looked up and saw the cold, pale features of his companion relax and quiver with emotion, and he felt the hand he held in his own tremble. `I do not blame you,' he went on to say, `for despising my crime and me; but oh! judge me not too severely. Consider my motive—' He murmured something more, but in such low tones that Maria heard them not. There was a long pause, when at last Mr. Acton drew his wife towards him, still holding her hand in his, and whispered— `Can you forgive me?' There was another pause—a long silence broken only by the stifled sobs of Mrs. Acton, and Henry's deep drawn sighs! Sympathy for her husband overcame every other feeling, and Maria bowed her head upon his bosom, while the hot tears coursing down her cheeks fell thick and fast upon his hand. `Oh! I forgive you all!' she sobbed.— But do not die—I shall feel as if I had killed you!' Henry smiled faintly. `It is too late,' he murmured. `Yet I die with the satisfaction of being assured of your forgiveness!' Death entered the house that night before the hour of one. When daylight appeared, the form of Henry Acton lay cold and stiff and senseless in a dark, still, solemn chamber. His soul had gone to its eternal resting place, freed from its natural tenement by its own will and power. The sudden death of Mr. Acton created quite a sensation in the county at that time, for he was a man of considerable influence, such as wealth will always command. Inquiries were made, reports were spread— grave surmises were whispered—but none divined the true cause of his decease. None, except Frederick Farley, Maria and her sister, who knew but too well that his death was occasioned by poison! Mrs. Acton was crushed by sorrow. Notwithstanding the late events in her husband's life, there was never a woman that mourned more seriously for a husband than she. She was now, as it were, alone in the world. Her husband and her child had been snatched from her as if by Fate, and she had no bosom friend, save her sister Edith, left. Mr. Acton left a large property behind him, which was willed to his wife and child alone. Many were the friends that came to visit Mrs. Acton in her affliction, but all failed to restore her mind to peace. It was on the second day after her husband's funeral that Mrs. Acton received a stranger, an unexpected visitor. It was Louis, the valet de chambre of Gustavus Burnam. Strange emotions crowded Maria's heart as she recognized Burnam's confidential servant. She grasped a letter he handed her and eagerly tore it open. It was couched in these terms: `Respected Lady— Pardon me for addressing you at this time, and overlook the impropriety of the step, in consideration of the motive by which I am actuated. It is to make known to you that your son Robert has been found. He was stolen by Cabel Crowl, or an accomplice of his; and that villain carried him, the same night on which he was taken, to the house of an old woman, living in a miserable quarter of the town. I kept the villain in custody from that time until the day on which you saw him. On the next day evening he came to me again, and said, that having gone to the woman with whom he left your son, he had learned that the child was lost again. Through the vigilance of Louis, I discovered that Crowl had carried off Robert, and learned where he had concealed him, on the very night the event took place; and directed Louis to see that the child was restored to you directly. `Before he could do so, however, Robert tired probably of the company of the woman under whose charge he was, ran away from her and was lost in the streets of Boston.— As soon as I learned this, I ordered Louis to spare no pains or expense in tracing him out, which he has at last succeeded in doing. `You may have seen an announcement of Crowl's death in the papers. If not it will be news to inform you that he was drowned the night on which he made known to me that Robert had been lost from the woman with whom he left him. `I leave Boston to-morrow, to spend the winter in the south. Remember me to your sister, and to Dr. Farley, to whom I feel under lasting obligations. Adieu, Your friend, Gustavus Burnam.' Mrs. Acton did not stop to read the whole of this letter at once, but as soon as she saw the intelligence that Robert was found, she started up, calling upon Louis to tell her what had been done with the child. Mrs. Barnes had him in the hall, and the next minute he was clasped to his mother's breast. `My dear, dear boy!' she exclaimed, covering his face with kisses; `I thank God that you have been restored to me—I thank God!' `That ugly woman carried me off!' said the boy, looking up into his mother's face. `She took away my clothes too; but a good man gave me some new ones and sent me home! He was a good man, wasn't he, mother?' `Yes, yes!' answered Maria, hastily. And now, when Edith came to embrace the happy boy, Maria caught up the letter she had dropped, and brushing away the tears of joy that bedimmed her eyes, read it through, stopping from time to time to glance around upon her child, as if to make sure that it was not all a dream. Meanwhile Louis stood waiting. Maria sat down at the table, and with a trembling hand, penned a brief note of thanks, which ran thus: `Would I could express my joy and gratitude for the restoration of my dear child! My heart is too full! I can only say that to the last day of my life you will be remembered with the warmest sensations of thankfulness, friendship and respect, by Maria.' She folded this note, superscribed it with the name of Gustavus Burnam, and gave it to the valet de chambre, saying to him in French,— `Dites a Monsieur q'une autre fois j'aurais mieux exprimé ma reconnaisance. A present c'est la joie qu'il m'a causee qui me fait folle!' Louis bowed and disappeared. `Voici une reponse,' he said, as, half an hour after, he gave Maria's letter to his master—`here is her reply; and she told me to say to you that another time she could have expressed her gratitude in better terms than now, when frantic with the joy she owes entirely to you.' Burnam's features betrayed more excitement than was his wont, as he eagerly tore open Maria's letter, and cast his eye over the characters which her own hand had traced and her own tears had blotted. In a moment, however, all emotion had faded from his eye; and with his wonted coolness he folded the note, and proceeded to give Lewis further orders concerning their departure on the morrow for the south as if nothing had happened. On the following day Gustavus took leave of Boston, to the great disappointment of divers managing mothers, among the upper classes, who regarded him as a desirable match for the wealthiest and fairest of maidens, and who now, seeing that he withstood all the charms of youth and beauty, whispered among themselves— `What a strange, incomprehensible being!' CHAPTER XXIII. On an Important Subject. SORROW, anxiety and continued excitement, proved too much for the delicate constitution of Mrs. Acton. Shortly after her husband's death, she was taken suddenly ill, and her life was at one time despaired of. Edith was her constant nurse. Frederick Farley was her medical attendant, and he did all in his power to conquer the fever by which she was consumed. Thus were Frederick and Edith thrown together. Seeing each other every day, they had a better opportunity than ever before of studying each other's minds and dispositions. Frederick avoided Edith frequently, for loving her as he did and feeling that his love was vain, he could not bear her presence. His appearance towards her was studied, yet sometimes strange, and incomprehensible to any save Edith herself. She felt that he loved her still! The more she saw of him, the more she felt herself drawn, towards him by the ties of sympathy, and the more she wondered that she could ever have preferred the Rev. Mr. Everett to him. She felt that he loved her still. Yet he was so cold, so distant that he pained her. Already her heart beat with love for him, and his very address served to fan the flame. How much would she then have given had he never proposed and never been refused, for she knew he was too proud to sue a second time, and she could not make known to him the change in her affections. Meanwhile, Edith devoted all her cares to her sister, who was slowly recovering. Kate still remained with the Actons, having become so attached to Edith, who had taught her to love virtue and loathe the course of life she had before pursued, that she could not think of returning to the city, in the midst of her vicious acquaintances. There was but one of her old associates she could remember without a shudder, and that was Light Joe. He had always been kind to her; his faults were the result of necessity or habit, rather than of a naturally vicious nature; he was not brutal like the most of his class, but generous, and alive to the best feelings of the human heart. It was for this Kate loved him, and prayed Heaven that he might abjure his evil inclinations to give his good ones growth. The young burglar had not visited her in some time, and as she heard nothing from any of her old friends, she began to fear they had found the inside of certain thick and gloomy walls. It might be, however,—she thought— through the fear of such an unpleasant termination to his schemes that Mr. Joseph Jenks avoided approaching the residence of the Actons. One morning, however, while Maria was still dangerously ill, Joe came boldly around to the back entrance, and knocked at the kitchen door. It happened that Kate came herself to admit him. She knew not who it was until the door was opened, and the young man caught her by the hand. `Oh, Joseph!' she exclaimed, warmly; `how glad I am you have come! I have so wanted to see you! Do come in—there is nobody here but myself.' `Glad to see me, eh?' said Joe, kissing her with a hearty good will. `I was afraid you had forgotten me.' `You know that's what I couldn't do,' replied Kate. `But what is the news, Joseph?' `The news—ah! yes! I forgot to tell you—though perhaps you have heard of it already.' `Of what?' `Of Gordon's death.' `Gordon dead?' `Yes. He was drowned several nights ago. A man who saw him fall off the wharf into the water—it was one Barnum, or Burnham, or Burnam, or some such name—he saw him fall into the water, and called for assistance; but before the poor devil could be got out, he had drank salt water enough to finish him. So there 's an end of him—his accounts are all settled. Kate was shocked by this intelligence, for little as she had ever liked Gordon, the suddenness of his death affected her in no slight degree. `I've more news,' said Joe. `Last week I had the honor of a visit from the Reverend Mr. Everett—your old friend, Marvin. He talked of shooting me because somebody else had exposed his villainy; and of strangling you, because you told how he had wronged you; and all such nonsense as that. I laughed at him and sent him to the devil as politely as I knew how, reminding him by the way that he would make nothing by attempting to injure you.' `How is Aunt Margaret?' asked Kate. `As bad as ever. She wants you to come home immediately.' `I have no home,' said Kate, sadly. `Where she lives—' `I would not return there for all the world!' I would not, indeed!' she replied, earnestly. Joe looked at her inquiringly. `To be plain,' pursued Kate, `I am happier here than I have ever been before since my acquaintance with Marvin began. I'll die—starve before I will become as bad again as I have been since you have known me.' `You like work, then, better than idleness and crime,' said Joe, and he added in a tone of deep earnestness, `I am glad of it!' `I love peace,' said Kate, `and a clear conscience. Oh! how I should like a neat little house in the country, away from the confusion, misery and filth we meet with in the city! How delightful it would be to get up at sunrise every morning, and go skipping over the dewy hills in the fresh and bracing air!' `I believe it would be pleasant,' added Joe, `provided we were with those we loved.' `To be sure—with those we loved,' repeated Kate. `But I would n't ask for many friends. Indeed, I think that with nobody but you, I could be happy. We could work, Joe, during the day—and that would be pleasant, I think, in the country—and in the evening we could sit down together and enjoy ourselves a great deal better than we ever did where there was drinking, fighting and swearing.' `I believe you,' said Joe, pressing her hand and looking very thoughtful. Then Kate went on to paint the pleasures of the little home she had imagined, in such vivid colors, that Joe was completely carried away, and burned with impatience to leave the city and fly to the country with the girl he loved. He was checked by a thought of the difficulties to be overcome. `It will be easily done,' said Kate. `We have already two hundred dollars in the bank—' `So we have!' exclaimed Joe; `and I've got a little besides.' `It will take but a small sum to carry us to the West.' `To the West?' `To the great prairies of Illinois, or to the beautiful woodlands of Wisconsin! There, it is easy to get a living; and a poor man, if he is only industrious, can soon buy a farm. Land, you know, is cheap, and you have a long time allowed you to pay for it in.' `Well thought of, Kate, I must confess!' exclaimed Light Joe, enraptured. `We will be married to-morrow, if you will just say so.' `Don't hurry matters too fast,' interrupted Kate, smiling. `Only be careful not to change your mind, and wait patiently until we can get fairly ready, and then we will soon lay the foundation of lasting happiness.' `And I will have a wife, a home, and children of my own!' exclaimed Joe, pressing Kate tenderly to his bosom. It was a dark day, late in the month of November; not cold, although there was a fitful, biting wind; but damp, unpleasant and gloomy. The sky was hung with black clouds, and the day was farther obscured by the particles of snow that filled the air and melted as they fell. Mrs. Acton, just recovering from her illness, was sitting by the window of her room, gazing out upon the dreary scenery presented to her view, when Frederick Farley called in to enquire concerning the state of her health. `You must not indulge in low spirits,' said he. `You look altogether too melancholy to day,' he added, endeavoring to arouse him—`indeed the dismal image of the weather is mirrored in your face.' `I was meditating,' she said, `on the change which has taken place during the past few weeks. I cannot but be sad when I think of it.' `There have been many changes,' replied Frederick, anxious to divert her mind from gloomy meditations, `some of which I cannot understand.' `What do you allude to?' `One thing—I never see Mr. Everett here of late; and I believe he was once a frequent visitor of yours.' `That change I cannot understand myself,' replied Maria. `Edith knows why he avoids us, I think, but she has never told me the cause of her own accord, and I have never questioned her.' At that moment Edith entered. She was pale and appeared worn out by long watching, but Frederick thought her more beautiful than ever. Mrs. Acton mentioned the subject of conversation to her sister, and asked her if she had seen Mr. Everett of late, or if he had called since she was taken ill. Edith answered in the negative, and added— `I have reason to think he will never call on us again.' This was spoken in a tone of peculiar meaning which made Frederick start. Having long regarded Mr. Everett as his more successful rival, it was with joyful surprise that he learned his error. As he bent an earnest look at Edith's sad countenance, she raised her eyes to his, but dropped them immediately, fer they were filled with tears. She hurried from the room, and entered the parlor, where she brushed away her tears, chiding herself for her weakness.— She sat down by the window, where she remained for some minutes, gazing with moist eyes upon the dreary scene without. Suddenly there was a light step upon the carpet, and a well known voice, that made her start, pronounced her name. Turning, she beheld Frederick Farley standing by her side. She arose immediately in some confusion, but the young man bade her keep her seat, and drew a chair to her side. `You will excuse me, I trust,' he said in tones that quivered with deep feeling, for approaching a subject which should have been dropped forever, did I not flatter myself with the hope that you have changed your mind.' He paused, earnestly watching the expression of her features. She knew what was coming, and trembled with a sort of nervous hope and joy which suddenly possessed her. `—That you have changed your mind,' he resumed, `in relation to myself. It may be vanity in me to think such a thing possible; and I cannot explain even to myself why I hope; but something tells me that should I offer you my hand again—' He paused once more; her eyes were downcast, and glistening drops trembled on her long dark lashes; her features were alternately pale and glowing red; and as he drew her hand in his, he felt that it quivered. He resumed: `—That should I offer you my hand again you would hesitate before you refused.— Speak frankly—may I hope?' She did not speak, however; yet she cast on him a look full of confidence, and love, and happiness, that sent a thrill of joy to his heart; and the lovely hand he pressed so ardently to his lips, she yielded to his possession without a struggle. CHAPTER XXIV. Conclusion. TOWARDS the close of a lovely day in the month of September, following the events we have recorded, a single horseman —to use the expression of a well-known modern writer—might have been seen riding slowly along the borders of a pleasant wood but a few miles from Boston. Were this history purely fictitious we should beware of imitating the `cavalier' style of the author alluded to above; but it being an indisputable fact that there was a horseman on the occasion and in the circumstances mentioned, we record the truth boldly and without hesitation. So, there was a horseman; and he was alone, and his horse paced leisurely the dry, well-beaten wood; and the traveller cast a delighted eye about him, like the true admirer of Nature, who takes pleasure in `holding communion with her visible forms.' The September sun was declining in the cloudless western sky, and the meadows, woodlands, cottages and sloping hill-sides, which surrounded the traveller, lay basking like creatures of life and feeling, in the golden, mellow sunlight. And the traveller passed on, until he arrived in the shadow of a large spreading oak that stood on the road-side. Here, a little retired from the highway, stood a beautiful white cottage, in a romantic situation, half hidden from the traveller's view by thick shade trees by which it was surrounded. The horseman dismounted, and tying his animal to a staple driven in the oak by the road, threw open the gate, and took the path leading to the cottage door. Having rung the bell, he stood contemplating the objects presented to his view, as he waited for the inmates to give him admittance. The walks, he observed, were laid out with the greatest neatness and taste —flower-beds and vines were beneath and about the windows; and in the panelling of the door was set a silver plate, on which was engraved, in fanciful characters, the name— `Dr. F. Farley.' The house-keeper appeared. It was the old acquaintance of the reader, — Mrs. Barnes. `Is Doctor Farley in?' enquired the visitor. `He will be at home in an hour,' replied Mrs. Barnes. `Is his family at home?' `There are none of them at home; but I expect them shortly. Will you walk in and wait?' The visitor was shown into the sitting room. Mrs. Barnes was about to retire, when he checked her by a question. `Mr. Farley is married, I believe?' `Oh, yes; the doctor has been married several months,' replied the housekeeper. `I used to be acquainted with his wife, I think. Did he marry a lady named Irving, a sister of Mrs. Acton?' `That's the lady; and a better matched pair you never saw. They love each other now, I believe, as well as on the day they were married. He idolizes her, and she thinks there is nobody like her husband.' `Was there not a clergyman paying attention to Miss Irving—or Mrs. Farley—about three years ago?' `Yes, sir—the Rev. Mr. Everett. It was thought she would marry him at one time, but she finally made choice of the doctor. It was said there were some suspicions concerning Mr. Everett's moral character, but they were hushed up by his friends, because he was the pastor of a congregation. He left the place suddenly and rather mysteriously, and nobody knows what has become of him. There was a servant girl living with us about that time, who, I believe knew something of Mr. Everett that was not altogether in his favor. She hinted as much to me one day, and she was as honest a girl as ever lived.' `Her name—' `Her name was Catherine Munson. She was a dear good creature; she had the best little heart that ever beat in any girl's bosom. I was sorry to lose her, but she married a young man named Jenks, and they have both gone to the west. I had a letter from her a few days ago, in which she writes that she was never so happy in her life as she is now. It is enough to make one fly to read her description of her little cottage, and the grove behind it, and the stream close by, and the prairie beyond, which she says blooms with the most beautiful flowers she ever saw during the greater part of the year. But I am telling about that which you can have no interest in.' `By no means. I love to hear of the happiness of young people, especially if they are in the humbler ranks of life. But with regard to Mrs. Acton—' `Oh! Mrs. Acton, since Edith's marriage, has made it her home with Dr. Farley. She is with us now, together with her little boy, Robert.' `Does she enjoy good health?' enquired the stranger. `I believe she does; but she looks paler than she used to, and is more subject to melancholy. There were some circumstances connected with her husband's death which has had a lasting effect upon her mind.' At that moment a carriage drove up before the house, and Mrs. Acton and Robert, together with Frederick's wife and mother, descended with the assistance of Dr. Farley. Mrs. Barnes hastened to meet them, and the visitor was left alone when Frederick entered. Ten minutes after, the young doctor knocked at the door of Mrs. Acton's apartment. Being admitted he said to her that he had an old friend in the parlor to whom he wished to give her an introduction. She followed him, leaning on his arm.— The visitor arose as they entered, and Frederick pronounced his name— `Mr. Gustavus Burnam!' There was a wild confusion in Mrs. Acton's brain at this moment. Her senses reeled—her heart throbbed with emotions of surprise and delight mingled with a sort of indefinable dread; and she scarce knew what she did. When she recovered her presence of mind, she found herself alone with Gustavus. `This visit is so unexpected,' she murmured, `that you will excuse me for betraying such surprise. I am very glad to see you. I was afraid you would never visit me again.' `It was the recollection of the past which brought me here,' replied Gustavus. `When we parted, I thought we should never meet again; for to do so, I thought, would be productive of unhappiness to us both. You were married then, and, after what had passed, I deemed it impossible for us to continue on terms of simple friendship. If you had loved me once, you had given your hand to another since, and I felt that you would gladly have me avoid you. Since that time, however, I have never ceased to think of you, and now, no longer unable to keep away, I have returned—' `Mr. Burnam,' interrupted Maria, `you surprise me—I had thought that my unworthy treatment of you would alienate you from me forever!' `I have returned to you,' pursued Gustavus, without noticing the interruption, to see if by doing so, I could not fill a void in my heart—an aching void which time and the incidents of life cannot make me forget; a void which has been there since the day on which I deemed you lost to me forever. You are single now; the love you once professed for me may still warm your heart; and as for myself, I believe that I can never be truly happy without you. Excuse me for coming to the point thus abruptly, for I am anxious to know your mind and my destiny at once. I offer you my hand: will you accept it?' Maria was agitated and very pale; and when she spoke there was a tremor in her voice which betrayed the depths of her emotion. `I will be candid—it is my duty to be frank with you,' she said, without raising her eyes from the carpet. `If you can forget that I was once betrothed to you, and suffered myself to believe an infamous lie; that I deserted you when afflictions came upon you, and shuddering at your supposed crime, conscientiously avoided listening to your explanations, which I thought no offset against the evidence which was brought forward to prove your guilt; if you can forget that, after this, I gave my hand to the man who did more than any other to work your ruin; and if you can forgive all this in one so weak and foolish as myself, and love me still—I give you my hand, with the heart which none ever truly possessed but yourself.' And she extended her hand to Gustavus; timidly, as if she felt that he must shudder at the thought of accepting it; but he pressed it to his lips with passionate eagerness, thanking her with heartfelt gratitude for the gift. `You are too good—too ready to forgive!' sobbed Maria, in the fullness of her heart. `But I will endeavor to repay you with all the strength of woman's love, and all the fidelity of her devotion. Only, forget the past!' `All is forgotten and forgiven,' whispered Gustavus, as he drew her gently to his heart, and called his own forever. That evening there was a happy circle in Edith's parlor. She and her husband were there, and Frederick's mother, and Maria, and Gustavus Burnam, who was as fascinating and brilliant in conversation as ever.— And little Robert, too, was there, and he talked of the time, that appeared to his young heart so long ago, when he was restored to his mother by Gustavus, after having seen some strange adventures among strange people, and in places equally strange. Late in the evening, Gustavus arose to take his leave, In vain did his friends endeavor to prevail on him to pass the night with them; riding horseback was his favorite exercise, and he loved to travel alone in the still and solemn night; and besides, he had business, he said, which required his presence in Boston. He accordingly took leave of them, and mounting his horse, spurred at a rapid pace along the road by which he came. Arrived at his hotel, late in the night—or rather early in the morning—he found the faithful Louis, who had concluded to devote his life to his service, in his apartments, awaiting his return. `I have news for you,' said he to the valet de chambre. `Merci, monsieur. `I am to de married soon.' `C'est bien,' replied Louis, without betraying the least emotion. `But I hope you will grant me one favor.' Speak.' `It is that when you have a wife to love and cherish, you will not forget Louis, nor turn him off like a useless animal, because you have less need of him. I'd rather be the servant of a man like you, than the possessor of all your riches.' `I'll not forget you!' exclaimed Gustavus, grasping his hand. How proud Louis felt of that honor!— his master had deigned to touch his hand. In the course of three months Mrs. Acton had made preparations for her approaching marriage, and at the end of that time there was a splendid wedding party given in Dr. Farley's house. Gustavus and Maria were united, and the wrongs they had both endured at the hands of others, were in a measure recompensed by the happiness of their union. `Although we have been long separated,' said Gustavus to his bride on the evening of their marriage, `it was fated, dear Maria, that we should be brought together again before the prime of life was passed; and now, with the assurance that we were created for each other, let us be happy in each other's love, and forgetting the past, make the present and the future ours!' `We will—we will!' murmured Maria, while her eyes filled with tears of love and happiness. `I am sure of it—for this is the happiest moment of my life, and something whispers me that ours is no transient bliss. THE END.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">6 THE CHILD OF DESTINY. BY PAUL CREYTON. CHAPTER I. THE TWO FRIENDS. It was late at night. The good bourgeoisie of the city of Paris had retired to rest, and the strets were deserted and silent, save that at intervals a fiacre or a carrosse rattled over the pavements, and the quick footsteps of an occasional passenger fell upon the ear. The theatres and other places of amusement were closed for the night, and the swarms of pleasure-seekers which they poured forth had time to reach their homes. The soirce of the beautiful Mademoiselle Marie Duval had passed pleasantly away, and the select few, who had been admitted to her society, were now taking leave of her, one by one, and sauntering into the streets. Two alone lingered after the rest were gone, and these were among the most favored of the guests of M. Duval and his daughter. Maurice Lambert had long been intimate with the family, to which he had some time before introduced Ernest Clairet, his bosom friend; and as Maurice was held in high esteem by both Marie and her father, Ernest was, for his friend's sake, regarded rather as an acquaintance, than one whom the family Duval scarcely knew. The two friends, we said, lingered after the other guests were gone, but they, too, at last, took their leave, and, arm in arm, sauntered along the street. To have seen them, one would scarcely have recognized in their thoughtful features the two gay young men who, an hour before, attracted the attention of the entire party by their elegant address and ready wit. Their gayety had passed away, and a sort of pleasing seriousness had taken possession of their hearts. For some time neither spoke, but they walked on in silence, absorbed in their own reflections. `What ails you, Ernest?' cried Maurice Lambert, breaking in upon his friend's meditations. `I was thinking,' said Clairet, with a smile. `Very probable,' returned his friend; `for I believe that every rational being thinks. But may I ask what weighs upon your mind, giving to your every look and action a tinge of melancholy?' `Diable! I do not know, myself, Maurice. But somehow the look which our good friend Duval gave me, as I took my leave, calls up early associations, and it seems to me that I have seen his face before.' `Indeed?' `Yes, Maurice, it is even so; although where or when I cannot tell. It must have been many years ago, however—perhaps when I was a poor, forsaken orphan.' `Dame, Ernest! tell me about that—when you were the orphan you have so often mentioned in my presence.' `Not to-night, Maurice,' said Ernest, shaking his head sadly, `for the recollections Duval's strange look called up, are sad enough without recurring to the details of my early history. You know that I am an orphan, that I was adopted at an early age by the excellent M. Clairet, whose name I have borne ever since, and that I have every reason to consider myself a fortunate man. But the wrongs I endured—the wrongs which killed my mother, which I have since sworn to revenge, if Heaven has not saved me the task,—you know nothing of them, my dear Maurice, and I hope you never will!' `Pardon me, Ernest, for questioning you: I was not aware of the deep wounds in your bosom, and am sorry to make you sadder than before.' `Parbleu!' exclaimed Ernest Clairet, vehemently. `I am sad, and unless I seek some stirring scene—some powerful excitement, the melancholy of this night will stay with me for days. It is what I cannot shake off without assistance.' `Then I will remain with you, Ernest; we will seek some diversion together, and I will help you to get rid of your melancholy thoughts.' `Thanks, thanks, dear Maurice; but what do you propose?' asked Clairet. `You are fond of play?' `It is an amusement although I never play for money, except through courtesy.' `I know it is, Ernest. But the game alone excites you. If you would forget your own thoughts, you could do no better than spend the remainder of the night—or at least a part of it—at Jean Louis' saloons. The company there is always of the first class, the players generous, and the wine superb. What do you say?' `Sacrebleu! I accept your proposition,' replied Ernest Clairet, quickening his pace. CHAPTER II. THE GAMESTERS. Half an hour after, the two friends were stationed in one of the most fashienable gaming saloons in the great metropolis of France. Foreigners from almost every country were present. Russian counts, Italian amateurs, English sportsmen, and German speculators, were mingled with dandies, blacklegs, artists, and even the nobility of Paris. All appeared upon the same footing there—all seemed moved by one common impulse—the passion for gaming. Ernest Clairet was engaged with an experienced Parisian player, while Maurice, together, with several strangers, stood by, watching the progress of the game. Although a moderate player, and what is termed an amateur, for want of better or more suitable phrase, Ernest was unusually skillful at cards, being quick at observation, and accustomed to all the games and tricks of the day. On the present occasion, however, he had his match. His adversary played with great coolness and precision, turning his whole attention to the game. Ernest, at first, played carelessly; but when louis after louis had passed from his purse, over to the side of his adversary, he began to pay greater attention to the game, although he played with the same coolness as before. His fortune, however, did not change. Vibert—for such was his adversary's name—continued to win from him until he had but a single bill of fifty francs remaining in his pocket. This Ernest staked, played for—and lost. `Morbleu, M. Vibert!' he exclaimed, `you are in luck to-night! You have won from me more than eight hundred francs, and I havn't time to stop and recover my losses. Another time, however—' `It is not late, Mousieur,' interrupted Vibert, politely. `Not late, I know, but you will excuse me for to-night,' began Ernest; but a murmur of disapprobation among the spectators checked him, and he cast a meaning glance at Maurice Lambert. Maurice understood him, and knowing that the adopted son of M. Clairet was not always flush with ready money, slipped a billet de banque into his hands, unobserved by the spectators. Ernest glanced at it hastily, and a strange smile played upon his lips—he saw that it was equal in value to all that he had lost that night. `If then I am to be revenged on you, to-night, M. Vibert,' said Ernest, gaily, `I must do it at one stroke. There is my stake.' `Good!' exclaimed Vibert, and the cards were again arranged. The game was short, but played with the greatest coolness and attention. `You have lost, Monsieur,' observed Ernest, carelessly. `Are you satisfied now?' `Ah, Monsieur, you are very kind!' returned Vibert. `But you will not surely leave me so—' `A votre service,' said Ernest, shuffling the cards. `The stake?' suggested Vibert. `That billet de banque seems to be a lucky one,' observed the other, with a smile. `If you have no objection—' `Not the least,' interrupted Vibert. Once more they played, and once more the billet de banque won. `Sacrebleu!' muttered Vibert; `que fe suis bete! Had I not played a diamond when it should have been a trump;—but never mind; we will try the game once more.' Vibert studied the game until the perspiration stood upon his brow; played with the utmost caution: watched every move of his adversary as the tiger watches his prey: but all in vain. A third time Ernest was in luck. Vibert said not a word, but wiping the sweat from his forehead, proceeded to shuffle the cards. `The billet de banque again?' asked Ernest. Vibert made no reply, save a gesture of affirmation, and again the play went on. `Pardieu!' the devil is in your fingers!' muttered Vibert, forcing a smile as still another thousand francs pased over to Ernest's side. `Only a momentary change of fortune,' said Ernest; `you will recover in a short time.' Again they played, and again Vibert lost. He became agitated at last, and played like an insane man, clutching the cards with desperate energy, and keeping his blood-shot eyes fixed upon the game. Ernest, on the other hand, was cool and self-possessed; he appeared to regard his astonishing successes with the utmost indifference. A group of admiring spectators soon gathered around them, greatly interested in the progress of the play. `My dear sir,' said Ernest, at length, frightened by the desperate manner in which his adversary played—`my dear sir, is it not time to finish for to-night? Another time—' `Play on—play on!' interrupted Vibert, in a husky voice. And they did play on; and in half an hour Ernest had reduced his opponent to the last franc. A death-like silence prevailed for a moment, as Vibert, with his ashy lips compressed, and his pale brow resting upon his hands, stared fixedly at the cards upon the table. `Let us away,' whispered Maurice, touching Ernest upon the shoulder. Ernest glanced at his friend, then at Vibert, and finally at the pile of money ne had won. `Diable, Maurice, what shall I do?' he murmured, passing his hand across his brow. `Here have I been playing for more than two hours without knowing what I was about. I played for amusement, never once thinking that I was ruining this poor devil, in fact, when I look at the money here, it seems that I have been dreaming. Tell me if I have won it all in fair play—' These last words alone reached the ear of Vibert. He started up, as if a sudden thought had flashed across his brain. `Fair play!' he echoed, with a ghastly smile. `Sacre dieu! I never lost like that with an honest player!' `Sir?' said Ernest, in a whisper, while the hot blood mounted to his brow. Vibert was desperate. While all the spectators started back with a sort of savage delight, he sprang forward, and glancing fiercely at Ernest, exclaimed: `You heard my words—all present heard them too!' Ernest had become perfectly calm. One would not have observed the least emotion in him, had not his features been a shade paler than usual. `Yes, Monsieur!' he said, politely, but with a sarcastic smile, `I heard your words, and beg to know when you deign to explain them to me.' `Morbleu! at any time—the sooner the better!' replied Vibert, fiercely. `Here is my address,' began Ernest— `I care not for your address,' interrupted Vibert. `It is better that our differences should be settled on the spot—here—at this very moment!' Cela m'est egal,' returned the other coolly. `It only remains for you to choose your weapons.' `They are chosen,' said the Parisian, pointing with a ghastly smile, at a pair of short swords that hung against the wall. `Be it so!' said Ernest. `Dame!' whispered Maurice, `you are not going to fight the fellow?' `Why not?' `Why not?' He is beside himself—he is desperate. Return him the money you have won, and let us begone.' `Maurice!' exclaimed Ernest, reproachfully, `you, too, are beside yourself, are you not? Consider that he insulted me before a crowd of spectators, and that I could not retreat if I would. I pity him, for in the state you see him, I am confident he will lose not only his money but his sword.' `Be not too confident,' whispered Maurice, `for I am told that Vibert is one of the ablest swordsmen in Paris.' `Tant mieux! tant mieux!' exclaimed Ernest, gaily. CHAPTER III. THE DUEL. As Maurice had said, Vibert was considered one of the first lames in the French capital. But Ernest was nothing daunted by the intelligence. Confident of his own skill—he having devoted much time to perfecting himself in the practice of all weapons used by duellists at that period—he was even glad to learn that he had no undue advantage over his adversary. They crossed their swords. Ernest was as cool as if merely going through with the exercises with a companion. Vibert, although heated with passion, and desperate, also appeared self-possessed; but he began the combat with an energy that contrasted strangely with the careless defence of his antagonist. An anxious group was collected around them, not the least interested of whom was Maurice Lambert. For some time the weapons of the combatants crossed, and wound about each other so to speak, with that grace and dexterity which bespeak the accomplished swordsman. At first Ernest confined himself to observing his adversary's mode of attack, and to defending his own person, without seriously returning his thrusts; but, at length, as Vibert pressed him more closely his weapon moved with greater rapidity and force, and his eye flashed with a strange and terrible meaning. The two blades clashed and grated against each other in quick succession, when Vibert made a masterly thrust and grazed his antagonist's side. `A hit!' murmured the spectators. `A scratch,' said Ernest, with a fiendish smile, `but there will be something worse in a moment!' He now changed his mode of defence into a furious and skilful attack, thrusting with such precision and rapidity that Vibert was obliged to fall back. Ernest darted forward, and with a skilful movement wrenched his antagonist's weapon from his grasp. `Finish me!' said Vibert. `Resume your sword,' returned young Clairet, with a smile. Vibert did so. Again the two were opposed to each other in deadly strife. Twice the cold steel touched the breast of Ernest. Vibert was bleeding at half-a-dozen wounds. feeling his strength failing fast, he thrust fiercely at Ernest, regardless of the wounds he himself received, and at last succeeded in planting his blade directly beneath his ribs, on the left side. No sooner did Ernest feel the pang shoot through him, than summoning all his remaining strength, he plunged his sword into the bosom of his antagonist, and fell with him to the ground. Maurice sprang forward to assist his friend. He had already fainted, and the blood was gushing from his wound. Two surgeons were at hand; one of them hastened to Ernest's side; and while the other was occupied with Vibert, proceeded to examine the gash in his side. The blood was staunched, and Ernest was conveyed to a couch. `The wound!' whispered Maurice, in an agony of doubt. `Is dangerous, if not mortal,' replied the surgeon. In a few moments the young man recovered his consciousness. `And Vibert?' he murmured: `have I killed him?' `Ernest!' exclaimed Maurice, `do not speak—' `But tell me if he is dead!' `I do not know. But you must be quiet.' `Quiet! how can I be quiet? Impossible, until I know if he is dead.' An attendant was sent to ascertain the truth. When he returned, Ernest had fainted a second time. On recovering, his first words were concerning Vibert. `He is not yet dead,' said Maurice. `Thank God!' murmured the young man. `I am the one to blame; and if he should die, I am a murderer!' `Hush, Ernest,' said Maurice. `Remember it was in a duel—' `A duel—yes! but it is unpleasant to think of leaving the world responsible for the death of a fellow-being, even though that fellow-being at the same time caused your own.' `Ernest—what do you mean?' `I mean that I feel what the surgeon would conceal from me—that my wound is mortal, and—' `No, no!' interrupted Maurice, in broken accents, `it is only a slight hurt.' `Do not attempt to deceive me, my dear Maurice,' replied Ernest, with a sad smile, `for I feel that I am going fast. Is my father, M. Clairet, sent for?' `Yes.' `Well, but if I die before his arrival, you will say to him that I thought of him with gratitude, until the last. And, Maurice—' Then the voice of the young man became so faint that his friend was obliged to incline his ear to his lips to hear him. `Go on,' said Maurice. `Send the attendants away.' `They are gone.' `My dear friend,' pursued Ernest, pressing his companion's hand, `I have but two requests to make, which, if you love me, you will fulfil.' `Ernest!' exclaimed the other, in a voice choked by sobs. `In the first place, if you ever meet a man named Laurence Belfont—a man of about fifty years—ask him if he remembers Virginie Lordilliere; and if he betrays the least emotion, it is he!' `Who?' `The man whom I have sought since I was able to wield a sword—the man I have sworn to punish—the man whom you must kill as you would kill the betrayer of your sister!' `But, Ernest—' `Do not question me, but swear to fulfil my request.' `I swear,' said Maurice, firmly. `It is well!' murmured his dying friend; `and now, Maurice, I have a secret for your heart alone. Take the locket you will find upon my heart—if it has not been removed, and I need say no more.' Maurice took the locket, opened it, and beheld the portrait of her he had long loved in secret—Marie Duval! He turned pale and started back. `You love her?' he murmured. `Do I love her?' sighed Ernest; `ah! better than life itself!' `And she—she loves you?' gasped Maurice. `Alas! I fear not! She does not even know of the passion that has consumed me —consumes me still!' Maurice breathed more easily. A feeling of jealousy had, for a moment, rankled in his bosom, but full of noble devotion to his dying friend, he banished all unworthy thoughts, and forgot that Ernest might have been his rival. `This portrait,' said Ernest, `you will keep.' Maurice raised the miniature to his lips, at the same time pressing the hand of his friend. `Keep it,' continued Ernest, faintly, `as the choicest jewel your friend ever possessed. When you look at it you will remember me, and for my sake you will regard Marie as a sister. I can say no more—do not forget Belfont—Maurice—Marie—' At that moment M. Clairet entered, and found his adopted son fainting in the arms of his friend. CHAPTER IV. A FRIEND'S DEVOTION. Contrary to the expectations of all, Ernest survived his wounds. For several days he lay, so to speak, on the brink of the grave; but at last, thanks to the surgeon's skill, youth, and a naturally strong constitution, he began slowly to recover. Several weeks after the events related in our last chapter, when Ernest had nearly regained his strength, Maurice Lambert was seated one day alone with Marie Duval. Little did the young girl suspect the feelings she had inspired in the hearts of the two young men, and still less did she dream of the struggle in Maurice's breast between love for her and devotion to his friend. Had Ernest never confided to him his passion, Maurice might have used every means to win the hand of Marie for himself, even in opposition to his friend; but, as it was, he felt that to do so would be not only dishonorable, but perfidious in the extreme. Nobly did he oppose the dictates of his passion; generously did he resolve to sacrifice his own happiness to that of his friend; firmly did he determine to conceal his love from all. Any less noble than he might have regretted that Ernest did not die; but Maurice, far above such unworthy thoughts, was the first to rejoice in the recovery of his friend. The young man, we said, was alone with Marie Duval He had determined to do all in his power to favor Ernest's interests, and had resolved to speak with Marie upon the subject. The young girl had just been reading in the works of the immortal Chateaubriand, the description of Atala upon her death-bed; and the passionate breathings of tenderness which that fair and virtuous being addressed to her afflicted lover, had sunk deep into her heart. Tears of sympathy were still glistening in her eyes; as, turning to Maurice Lambert, she said in a voice tremulous with emotion: `How deep and holy must be that passion which is triumphant even in death—which can inspire the heart to struggle against dissolution, and to feel itself immortal by the strength of love alone![1] [1] The words in the original are as follows: `Quand je songe que je te quitto pour toujours, mon eœur fait un bel effort pour revivre, que je me sens presque le pourvoir de me rendre immortelle a d'aimer.'—Chateaubriand's Atala. But I can scarce believe in the existence of such love.' `Indeed!' said Maurice. `No—for it is too heavenly—' `But I have witnessed it in a degree.' `You!' `Yes; only a few weeks ago, I was at the death-bed of a friend, whose last thoughts were of one whom he loved in secret, but deeply—perhaps hopelessly.' `A friend, do you say?' asked Marie, interested. `Yes, and it is a friend of mine too whom he loved.' `And she never knew his sentiments towards her?' `No, for he feared lest she might despise the poor offering of his heart.' `Ah!' said Marie, `little did he know of woman, if he judged her thus. She may reject, but she cannot despise man's love, though she may appear to do so to the world.' `But perhaps she whom he loved was an exception—she might be more cruel than her sex in general. But yet she is fair and gentle.' `Do I know her?' asked Marie. `You have seen her, perhaps,' replied Maurice with a smile. `And between us, I will say that my friend, feeling himself about to die, put into my hands the portrait of his mistress, which he had procured unknown to her, and worn next to his heart as a secret treasure.' `Have you it now?' `It is this,' replied Maurice, producing a locket. `Would you like to look at it?' `Ah!' sighed Marie, affected by the reality of the story her companion was relating; if it should prove the miniature of one I know, I fear that I could never look on her again without regarding her as unnatural and cruel.' `But you forget that she knew not the sentiments she inspired.' `True. But the portrait.' Maurice handed the locket to his companion, who opened it and beheld—a likeness of herself! She turned pale at first, and then a tinge of crimson mounted to her brow. `How is this?' she murmured, `explain.' `In the first place,' said Maurice, `you must know that my friend, although dangerously wounded, did not die.' `And what you have said is true?' `Every word,' except that he lives and loves you still.' Marie blushed, but it was not with shame nor offence. Marie was a woman; and none can deny that the thought of being the object of sincere and pure affection, is dear to woman's heart. But a pang shot through her bosom, for she cherished a hidden affection for another who she knew had not been dangerously ill. But Maurice, when he revealed to her the name of her lover, judged by her appearance, that Ernest was the object of her choice, and although his own heart received a wound, hastened to impart the intelligence to his friend. CHAPTER V. THE SECRET. `She loves you!' cried Maurice, breaking abruptly into the apartment of Ernest Clairet—`she loves you!' `Who?' demanded Ernest, his eyes sparkling with joy—`you cannot mean—' `Marie Duval—none other, I assure you, dear Ernest.' `But how is it possible—dear Maurice!' murmured Ernest, clasping his friend warmly by the hand; and he added, after a pause `are you sure of what you say?' `I have not a doubt.' `But how did you learn such joyful news?' `I beg your pardon, Ernest,' said Maurice, `for having been guilty of an indiscretion; and I am sure you will forgive me when I tell you all—my motives and my success.' `What do you mean?' cried Ernest turning pale. Maurice took his friend's hand, and related all that had passed between him and Marie Duval. Ernest listened eagerly, but the intelligence seemed to cause him less pleasure than pain. As his friend concluded, his brows gathered darkly, and his features became pale with agitation. `Maurice,' he said in broken accents, `you have done wrong—but you thought to do me a service, and I forgive you—thank you!' `Morbleu!' exclaimed Manrice, astonished; `are you mad? Explain yourself.' `Not mad!' returned Ernest with a melancholy smile, `but unfortunate. The thought of being beloved by Marie Duval would make my heart leap for joy, did I not look upon our union as next to impossible. As it is, the thrill of pleasure is accompanied with a thrill of pain!' Maurice was more astonished than before. `Explain, for heaven's sake, Ernest!' he exclaimed. `What mystery is this?— Marie loves you—you love her—you are on an equal footing in society—what is there to prevent your union?' `Prejudice!' replied Ernest. `How prejudice?' `Maurice,' said the adopted son of M. Clairet, sadly. `I can never possess the hand of Marie Duval without first revealing the secret of my birth; and that once known to her father, he is too proud to accept me as a member of his family. True I might perhaps marry her without revealing the secret, but it would be a dishonorable act. Alas! I feel that it were better had Marie never known of my unhappy passion, which I have long regarded as hopeless, while yet I have allowed it to prey upon my heart!' As Ernest spoke strange thoughts crowded the bosom of his friend. Curiosity to know the mystery to which Ernest alluded, pity for his unfortunate position, and bitter reflections with regard to his own hopeless passion for Marie, were mingled confusedly in his breast. `Ernest,' he said, after a pause, `may I ask as a friend and adviser, the secret which you say prevents your union with Marie?' `Have you not divined it?' `How could I?' `Do you not remember hearing me speak of one Laurence Belfont?' `Of him you have sworn to punish—' `The same.' `And who is he?' asked Maurice. `My father!' answered Ernest, covering his face with his hands. Maurice started back with a shudder of horror. `Your father—and you have sworn to take his life—' `I have sworn to be revenged on him!' said Ernest, firmly; for betraying Virginie Lordilliere, my mother, and for abandoning her, and me, the offspring of her shame!' Maurice regarded his friend with astonishment. He had never suspected the secret of his birth, and now the news came like a clap of thunder. `You are surprised,' said Ernest with a sad smile, `and perhaps you hate me now that you know my life began in infamy.' `Ernest!' exclaimed the other, reproachfully, grasping his hand; `you wrong me with such suspicions. I know the generosity of your heart—the nobility of your nature, and care not for the rest.' `You are above prejudice, Maurice,' exclaimed Ernest, warmly, tears of gratitude glistening in his eyes; `but they—Marie and her father—' His voice was choked with emotion, and he was unable to proceed. `Despair not,' said his companion. `If you deem it your duty to reveal the secret to them, do it boldly, as it is your custom to do every thing else, and I doubt not but they will be ready to overlook the circumstances of your birth.' `Ah! if I could only hope that M. Duval would prove as noble-hearted as you!' exclaimed Ernest. `But you must consider that I scarcely know him; and how can I except that he will regard me with favor?' `Then we will leave it to time to teach him the generosity of your nature; and then if he be a man of reason, he will put aside all prejudice. Only do not despair.' So saying, Maurice embraced his friend, and they parted. CHAPTER VI. M. DUVAL. The father of Mademoiselle Marie Duval was a man who had seen perhaps fifty winters—proud, passionate, and headstrong. During his youth he had been guilty of nearly all the follies which are but too frequent at that period of life; but, after giving way to his passions for a season, he finally married, and becoming attached to the fire-side of home, led an irreproachable life, which caused his youthful follies to be forgotten. His domestic happiness, however, was not destined to flow on without interruption, for scarcely had he tasted of its delights, when the partner of his bosom died, leaving him, as a pledge of departed pleasures, Marie, an only child. M. Duval did not marry again, nor did he fall back into his former course of life, but concentrating his entire affections in his daughter, devoted his fortune and his leisure to give her a finished education, and to afford her all the happiness in his power. It had been his chief delight to see her grow up under his personal care, and to watch the development of her mental and physical powers; and now that she had become a woman, all his happiness was concentrated in her, as before it had been concentrated in her mother, whose image was so like her own. It was several weeks after the interview between Ernest and Maurice Lambert, which we have just related, that the two friends made their appearance at the residence of M. Duval. Ernest, who had at last resolved to ask the hand of Marie of her father, was shown into the library of that gentlemen, while Maurice remained in the parlor with Marie. M. Duval was not a little surprised at the demand of Ernest, but yet he was not yet displeased. The fortune the young man would inherit from his adopted father, was by no means inconsiderable; and moreover, he knew Ernest to be every way qualified to make his daughter happy. In effect, he was on the point of giving his consent when the young man interrupted him `Before deciding,' said he, `you should know something of my history.' `What difference can that make?' `None, perhaps, but yet it may. At all events I deem it right for you to know who I am before you accept me as a son.' `What do you mean?' asked M. Duval surprised. `Perhaps you have not heard that I am only the adopted son of of M. Clairet?' `Indeed, I had not.' `So it is. I was received under his roof when I was seven years old.' `Well?' `Before that, I had suffered privation and sorrow. `To be frank, M. Duval, I am the son of a poor young girl, who loved, sacrificed all to the man of her choice, and was betrayed. In short, Monsieur, I am a natural child.' Having uttered this in a calm, low voice Ernest remained with his arms folded upon his breast watching the effect of his words on his companion. M. Duval started and turned pale. Perhaps the recollection of his youthful vices crossed his brain; or it may be that his regard for Ernest was changed to contempt. The two glanced at each other in silence Duval was the first to speak. `Your mother is dead?' `My mother committed suicide?' `Suicide!' echoed Duval. `Ah!' exclaimed Ernest, `you are pale, agitated—you are horror-struck, I see. But if you knew my poor mother's history, you could excuse her crimes, which heaven has forgiven.' `Go on,' murmured Duval. `My mother was the daughter of respectable parents, who brought her up in the patn of virtue and rectitude. But she had a woman's heart, and woman's weakness. The temper came, and having made her his own in heart, took advantage of her devotion and love, to steal away the jewel of honor. To hide her shame, she forsook her home in the country, and fled hither with her betrayer. A few months passed away, and her lovers attention and kindness half repaid her for the sacrifice she had made. But he became tired of her at last, and visited her only at long intervals. When I was born into the world, his visits had ceased altogether. `I have never learned how or where she lived during the first year after she left her father's house. I only knew that her betrayer supported her elegantly, for he was a man of wealth. When he deserted her, he sent her a purse of gold, with a note, informing her that he should never come to her again, and requesting that she should never seek him out. `Thus much of her history my mother related to me when I was old enough to comprehend the peculiarity of our situation, and to have the curiosity to learn who she was and if I had a father. `After being abandoned by her betrayer, my mother, ashamed to return to her father's house, supported herself and me with her needle. Soon the money he had left her was gone, and she was obliged to labor day and night to pay the rent of the little chamber into which she had removed, and to procure the necessaries of life. `Although this was long ago, I have a distinct recollection of seeing her sitting over her work, which she plied with tears of sorrow on her eyes. Her face was pale, and when she looked at me, it wore an expression of such hopeless woe, that, young as I was, I could not refrain from throwing my arms about her neck, and shedding tears of sympathy upon her bosom, while I resolved in my heart to take vengeance some day on the author of her misfortunes. `One day when I was about six years old, she took me with her into the streets. At no great distance from the house in which she lived, we met a gentleman and a lady, leading a little girl between them. I should not have noticed them had not my mother clasped my hand conclusively, trembled violently, and sank fainting upon the pavement. `Alarmed, I fell by her side, and supported her drooping head. In a moment she recovered, and casting her eyes about her saw the gentleman, at sight of whom she had fainted, and who had drawn near to learn the cause of her sudden illness. Their eyes met. My mother uttered a faint shriek; the gentleman started back. Dicu! I was in the presence of my father! And it was, doubtless his wife and daughter by whom he was accompanied.' At this portion of his recital, Ernest paused and buried his face in his hands, lost in gloomy reflection. Had he not done so he would have heheld his companion agitated and fearfully pale. The young man continued. `After this event, my mother became more melancholy than she had ever been before. I saw her so, and with painful solicitude sought to drive away her sadness. Alas! little did I dream that her reason, having suffered so many and such terrible shocks, was tottering from its throne! `About two weeks after the day we met my father in the street, I went one afternoon to play with the children of a poor woman with whom my mother had become acquainted. After three or four hours' absence from home, I returned, ran joyfully up the stairs to meet my mother. I opened the door: she was lying upon our miserable bed, and I stepped softly, in order not to awaken her. I was greatly surprised at finding the window closed tightly, and a suffocating smell of charcoal in the room. There was a furnace in the corner; but the coal had burned away to embers. I was alarm ed, but knew not the terrible meaning what I saw! `As I had often done before, I crept noiselessly to the bed in order to kiss my mother as she slept. Heavens! how I back with terror! Her features were —distorted with agony! I touched som—it was so cold that it sent horror through my frame! `How wildly then did I call her name, and strive to awaken her! did not answer me—she did not move did not even breathe. She was dead! `Wild with terror, I fled from the room. A man was passing by the outer door threw myself upon my knees before him. told him that my mother was dying, and besought him to come to her assistance. I raised me up; spoke to me kindly: I knew not what I said; but when I ran back to my mother's room he followed me up the stairs. `We reached our little chamber. `Here she is,' I said, throwing myself upon the corpse, and covering its blackened face with kisses. `For several minutes I remained in state of insensibility; I was half dead with grief and terror. On recovering my consciousness I looked up and saw the stranger bending over the dead body of my mother and gazing upon her livid features with a glassy stare. God! why had I not noticed his face before? It was he who caused my mother to faint in the street—it was her betrayer, and my father! `With an exclamation of horror he rushed from the room. I started after him shook my little hand angrily to call him back, ran to overtake him—but my strength failed—he escaped, and I have never seen him since! `I returned to my mother's room; gazed calmly upon the corpse, and, in the bitterness of my grief and rage, swore to spare no efforts to seek out my father—not to claim him as such, but to take revenge on him for my own and my mother's wrongs, when I become a man! `This is my history, M. Duval,' contin Ernest, walking to and fro, excited, I ask you frankly, if you can your daughter's hand in mar made no reply, but, like a per with horror, remained gazing man in . `,' cried Ernest, anxiously. `Can mine?' M. Duval pressed his trembling hands upon his brow, answered, in a husky voice: `Impossible! for she is your sister!' `My sister,' echoed Ernest, pale as death. `Yes—for I am Belfont—your father!' CHAPTER VII. FATHER AND SON. For a moment Ernest was stupified and speechless, and his glaring eyes were fixed upon M. Duval his father. `Did I hear correctly?' he muttered, stepping abruptly forward. `You say you are my father?' `I am, said Duval firmly. `Then hear me!' pursued the young man, in a passionate whisper. `I have sworn to punish the betrayer of my mother; for he acted basely, cowardly: and, Monsieur, if you are he, I insult and defy you on the spot!' `How?' cried Duval, starting to his feet. `You are a coward!' exclaimed Ernest, fiercely. The fiery blood of rage mounted to the brow of M. Duval; he trembled with passion, strode furiously towards Ernest, but restrained himself because he was his son! `Young man,' he said, calmly, after a pause. `I see that you would seek a quarrel with me, but insult me as you will, I cannot forget that I am your father.' `By heavens!' exclaimed Ernest bitterly, `the memory of the relationship returns upon your mind at a most happy moment, since you can use it as a smooth excuse for your cowardice. But why, may I ask, did you never think of this when I was starving with my mother in a miserable garret— when your son, as you call me, was in want of the necessaries of life?' Your son!' continued the young man, striking the table fiercely; `yes! and for that very reason, your mortal enemy! now that I have found you out, my mother's wrongs shall not go unavenged!' 'Calm yourself, young man,' said Duval recovering his self-possession. `This is a subject which should not be handled rashly. In the first place, consider that, in spite of all your taunts and insults, I will never raise my hand against you.' `Because I am your son and because you regard me with paternal tenderness!' said Ernest, with a sneer. `I repeat it: I will never fight with you,' pursued Duval. `I will not take your life, neither shall you take mine. Nay, do not start, but hear me. I acknowledge that I have done wrong, and that you have a right to hate me—to punish me; but my blood shall not be on your head. If heaven wills it, I will die, but not by the hands of a son.' `If heaven wills it—' `Yes; if heaven wills it, I will terminate my own existence—punish myself. Here is a chess-board; let us play a game. If you win, in less than twenty four-hours I shall be no more; if you lose, swear to pursue me no farther with your vengeance.' Ernest hesitated for a moment.' `It is well!' he exclaimed, at length; `let us play.' The chess-men were soon arranged. Both were excellent players, and now they exerted all their skill, for it was a fearful game— a game of life and death! Intensely did Ernest study the position of the blocks, for he thought of his mother's wrongs; but he was less calm than Duval, and therefore Duval won! `Lost!' muttered the young man, after contemplating the last and decisive move of his adversary—`lost! and it is well, for now that I think of it, I could not kill you, for you are Marie's father!' 'Beware!' cried Ernest: 'for if you seek thus to remind me of your relationship, I may yet forget myself, and break my word. The game is played. Adieu!' CHAPTER III. SUICIDE. It was evening when Ernest reached home. He spoke not to one of the family, out hastened to lock himself up in his room. `So I have found my father!' he murmured to himself, `and he is the father of my Marie, too! God! is it possible that she whom I love so madly is my sister! Then our love itself is sinful—our bliss impossible! Oh! would that we had never met!' The unhappy young man paced rapidly to and fro, nearly maddened by the dark thoughts which crowded upon his brain. He was interrupted by a knocking at the door. A servant came to put a letter into his hands. He recognised Maurice's handwriting and breaking it hastily open, read as follows: `My dear Ernest:—Shame prevents me from coming to you to-night, for I cannot but feel that I have acted treacherously towards you. Whilst you were with M. Duval, I was alone with Marie. The conversation as of you, dear Ernest. Judge of my surprise when she told me that she could not be yours—that she loved another. Then I forgot my duty to you, and instead of pleading for you, fell upon my knees before her, and pleaded for myself; for you must know that I too had loved her—long loved her in secret. I told her how I had concealed my passion for your sake—how I had resolved to sacrifice my own happiness to promote your bliss. `But if you love him not,' said I, not say that you love another! To could yield, but with another I will until the last. For I love you as ever will or can.' `Do not curse me, Ernest, for do not hate me when I say that her lovely hand upon my own, and tears of joy chased each other down her lovely cheek, confessed that, although she loved another beside you, that other was myself! `Heavens! how can I describe my joy— intoxication! But then, dear Ernest, I thought of you! Joy is no longer my lot—I am miserable—dying with remorse. `Write immediately, and say that you forgive me. `Your devoted friend, `Maurice.' Ernest read the letter twice, then sat down and wrote an answer. `Dearest Friend:—Accept my forgiveness, my benediction, my love! You have acted nobly—worthily of yourself. `When you read this I shall be no more: but do not think that either you or Marie caused my death. Far from it! I wish you happiness, and should have been content to live for you, had not a circumstance happened this afternoon, which drives me to put an end to my existence. `In my desk my friends will find the inscription I desire to have engraved upon my tombstone. You will see to it, my dear Maurice—you, who have served me so faithfully until now. `I have but a word more to say. Marie loves you, you say; her affection is worth more than countless treasures. You will, therefore, live for her, and make her happy. `Farewell—forever! `Ernest.' With a steady hand the unhappy young folded this farewell epistle; after wrote a short note to his adopted father. he burned a great number of use- and letters, arranged those he leave behind him, and wrote an his tombstone. carefully loaded a small pair closed the window-blinds, bolted door, and finally sat down to , with his face buried in his hands, on his past life, and on eternity. Five minutes after, the report of a pistol echoed through the house. Ernest was no more! CONCLUSION. Thus ended the life of the unhappy Ernest. But few knew the cause of his despair, his fatal resolution, and his death. M. Du val, his father, concealed the truth from his laughter, and vainly strove to banish it from his own bosom. But remorse and repentance were his portion during the remainder of his life. The memory of Virginie Lordilliere, of the fruit of her dishonor, and of their wrongs, was destined to rest like an incubus upon his soul. But the punishment of the father descended not to his daughter. She was happy with the man of her choice, never dreaming that the unhappy Ernest was her brother. Long did Maurice mourn for his friend; and even after the first burst of grief was passed, he went frequently with his young and beautiful wife to shed tears of sorrow over his grave. The inscription Ernest requested should be carved upon his tombstone was as follows: 'IL FIT LE MALHEUR DES SIENS; LE DESESPOIR LUI DONNA CONSEIL, IL SE SUICIDA.' THE END.</field>
