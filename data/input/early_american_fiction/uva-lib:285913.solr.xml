      <field name="fulltext">ADVERTISEMENT. The papers which follow appeared during the last summer, in the columns of the Charleston Mercury. Frequent applications to the writer, have persuaded him to consent to their republication in the present form. They may be allowed to speak for themselves without preface. I beg leave to inscribe them to the Hopeful, the Believing, and the Working Spirits among us, as designed, in part, to inculcate a faith in place, as necessary to a just performance of appointed duties. The Author.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A I. The members of the Monastery—our merry Monks of the Moon—had accomplished a third rubber of whist, when it was perceptible that a general cloud of gravity—it would be irreverent to call it dulness—had fallen upon the assembly. Our excellent Father Abbot himself was detected in a most expansive yawn, showing an extremity of condition such as had never befallen him before. We had our Jester, but he failed, in a laboured effort, to provoke the merriment of the order at the expense of our venerable head; and we were fast sinking into that state of collapse, which betokens dissolution and departure in social as in human bodies, when our excellent Father Abbot startled the brotherhood into sudden vitality, by an exclamation as unnatural in his case as it was uncongenial with the faith professed by the fraternity. Abbot.—I am weary of this life, my brethren, weary of this life! The Editor.—Does our Reverend Father design to commit suicide? Abbot.—Get thee behind me, Sathanas!— Would'st thou make a wanton paragraph? Do thy wits wander? Do'st thou deem me a fool, an absolute ninny, to suppose me capable of thinking that one may fling off the consciousness of life as if it were a garment—a thing of wool or linen—such as thou wearest in the vulgar form of the sack—a habit, which I take leave to say, is as unbecoming to thy person as it is ungracious in my eyes? Life is not to be flung off, or its consciousness. It is a thing to last forever. Change of condition is not death, whether wrought by the inevitable will, or by the rash and ridiculous madness of the poor and imbecile discontent. Of this I had no notion. I was meditating upon the unprofitableness and weariness of the present life we lead; of the lack of variety in our enjoyments; of the eternal same faces, and of the vexing monotony of thy newspapers, of which the shame and reproach are particularly at thy doors; lending thyself and press to this disgusting scramble after loaves and fishes, on the part of those who only fill their mouths with patriotism in the hope of filling them with bread. Editor.—Verily, Father, thou art right. Our papers have been but too much filled with this politician brawling. Abbot.—To loathing, sir—to utter sickness of heart and stomach! Thou hast thy lesson, let it be amended hereafter. With the cares of heat upon us—the apprehensions of disease—the pestiferous perseverance of mosquitoes—the newspapers should be filled only with soothing and grateful matters. It is then, especially, the duty of the A2 Editor to put forth all his strength, summon all his recruits to his assistance, and win the thoughts of men from present cares and troubles by the magic play of wit—the summer flashes of a joyous lightning that illumines the cloud without shattering the house top. Editor.—Ah! would our holy Father but assist us in this goodly performance. Abbot.—Hath he ever withheld himself from those who were in the condition to need and to receive his service? But, with the city deafened by the eternal and intolerable clang of contending factions, each of which cries with a tongue, the roots of which are in his abdomen, shall the singing birds of poesy or philosophy be heard? Preposterous! Purge ye of that. Let there be a calm, and smooth waters, that the dove may go forth on her mission, and proclaim the greenness and the beauty in that land which ye have but too much labored to defile. Editor.—We repent, Father. We have already made the confession of our sins. Assolvi; assolvi! Abbot.—If thy repentance be sincere, thy sin is forgiven thee! But for the future, our future as well as thine, beware how thou offendest after this fashion. The press is a trust confided to thy hands. It is not merely that thou should'st furnish intelligence of passing events, and advertise the wants of customers. It is for thee to exercise an overruling control even of the advertisements tendered thee, so that neither vice nor error shall expose itself for traffic in thy columns. Thou shalt even make grammar of thy advertisements, no less than of thy paragraphs, and suffer no scaramouch to play his antics in thy pages, unconscious of his own sootiness of aspect, to the annoyance of more modest neighbors. Verb. sat! And now for more personal matters. As I have said, this life hath become passing tedious. Even the Monastery lacks of its usual attractions. Beauclerk.—Alas! it is even so! Abbot.—It takes its aspect from the city, and from the depressed humors of the system, which are humbled by these excessive heats. The heart longs for change. Change is the life of nature. We must vary the prospect. Many a sick man dies from the monotonous aspects of his chamber. Give him another room, show him gleams of green and sunshine from any quarter of the heavens and the earth, and you give him hope—hope, sir, which lives ever on the refreshing resources of change. We must seek this change for ourselves. We are all sick;—thou no less than the rest. There is a greenness about thine eyes which tends to jaundice mine. The tongues of the Club are drowsy. Thou hast written no pleasant paragraph for a week or more, and Pictor has abandoned his easel. I mark ye, all, that ye drink more deeply of your claret, and your voices and brains seem to thicken accordingly. We must go abroad: we must wander— all who may—that our winter evenings may be made pleasant by draughts upon the grateful memory of our summer rambles. Pictor.—But whither, father? Abbot.—Ah! Pictor, already thy fancy rises; thy imagination begins to spread her wings. Thou A3 art thinking of the mountains of Saluda, of the Apalachian ranges, of the stupendous glories of the Tzelica, which the vulgar persist in calling the French Broad, because of the rude hunter, French, who, looking after “Bear and other varmint,” crossed the great back bone of the country, and stumbled upon its surpassing waters. Thou would'st fly, now, to Cæsar's Head, and to the Hickory Nut Gap; to tbe Table Mountain; to Tallulah, and to Toccoah! “Season thy patience for awhile,” my son. Thou shalt visit these favorite realms of sun and shadow, of temple and devotion, at the proper opportunity, but our present purpose contemplates not the interior. I would conduct thee to views along the great plain of ocean, rather than the wild ranges of rock and mountain. I would conduct ye to the finest watering place in all America—to one of the most glorious beach-drives that we may boast; where thou may'st daily behold the worshipping waters of the Atlantic, either subdued and sleeping at thy feet, or rising, rolling, revelling, or raging, in the wildest antics, for the surprise of thy fancy, or the excitement of thy imagination. All.—Where? Holy Father! Where is the delicious spot from whence we may behold these things? Long Island, Rockaway, Nahant! Abbot.—Pshaw! Yankee Humbugs, all!— with which our poor nincompoops, who find nothing good or beautiful but the foreign, have been deluding themselves for the last hundred years. Something nearer home, my children; more easy of access—more worthy, as well of our love, as our admiration. There, with the ocean opening its wide gates of foam, for a thousand leagues before us on the one hand, shall we turn upon the other to behold green islets, whose grassy slopes and wooded crests stoop to the brink of the sunny billows. We shall see smiling villages crowning the modest heights, the smooth waters of a bay scarcely less lovely than any we may name, its entrance strongly watched by frowning fortresses, which lie grimly waiting for the enemy, in a vigilance which never shuts the eye; and, beyond, a gay city with her daily rising spires, which seem to spring out from the ample bosom of the great sea itself. What would you more? Is not this a subject for your pencil, Pictor? Is not this a theme better fitted for your columns, Master Editor, than the cry of young and old ravens, equally clamorous with the chorus of the daughter of the horse leech—“Give! Give! Beauclerk.—But whither, Father; where is this scene of which you speak? Where do you mean to take us? Abbot.—Ah! you are all agog with curiosity. The charm works. The drowsiness hath left your eyelids, and the claret remains untasted in the goblets of Pictor and Beauclerk. Drink, children, that ye may have strength for the revelation. It will surprise you yet more. Io so che avete sete, perciò bevete! You will feel better after it. All.—We obey—and now. Abbot.—Can you not guess? All.—We have tried: No. Abbot, (solemnly.)—My children, such of ye as may, will leave with me in the last boat to-morrow afternoon for Sullivan's Island.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A4 II. Omnes.—To Sull—Sulli—Sullivan's Island, Father? Abbot.—Ye seem confounded, my children! Beauclerk.—And well we may be, Father. Who, till now, ever heard that Sullivan's Island was a place of so many attractions? Here have we been living, man and boy, for a matter of near two hundred years, and it is now, for the first time, that we hear the place spoken of as one possessing such superlative beauties. Abbot.—You mistake, Beauclerk! When we were a people of simple pursuits, and of a more manly and less dependent nature, it was greatly valued because of these very beauties. The grant which confers upon every citizen the right to build his wigwam upon Sullivan's Island, free of charge for land, was based upon its notorious attractions to the City, to which, indeed, it was conceived a place of prime necessity. Beauclerk.—For health, I grant you. Abbot.—“Dost grant me, hedgehog?” Well, and what is health, but the great essential of happiness; and upon what plea do our people fly northward with the summer, but that they seek for the securities of health? But the enjoyment of health necessarily implies comfort, though I am not satisfied to base my argument in behalf of Sullivan's Island upon its salubrity alone. I repeat the challenge, that ye will name to me a nobler beuch, a broader empire of sea prospect, upon which the eye may wander, sweeter, cooler, or more cherishing breezes, or a prospect within the harbor, of more becoming loveliness? Editor.—But, Father, the unmitigated heat, the blazing sun at noon-day—no trees, no shade! Abbot.—It is because ye live like vegetables rather than like men, when ye get there, that ye suffer from the heat! Do ye feel the sun when fishing, under an ample awning, with your anchor dropt just on the edge of Drunken Dick, and the billows lifting your bark, with a swell of breezes that come all the way from Cuba to fan your cheeks? Pictor.—Warmed moderately, and gratefully perfumed, with the sighs of the Cuban damsels. Abbot.—Precisely! The imagination of Pictor begins to glow. But, in truth, it is the stagnation, and not the heat, from which you suffer on Sullivan's Island. The heat is not a whit greater there than I have found it at noon-day, in the same season, at Saratoga and Long-Island; and the evenings are far lovelier and more refreshing. But, remember, I am not now speaking of what art has done, or may do, to make Sullivan's Island perfect as a place of summer resort. The houses are calculated rather against sudden tempest, than with regard to human comfort. Their plans, if indeed they ever were planned, are as wretchedly unsuited to the scene and situation, as if they had been tumbled out of rolling clouds. We should borrow for such a situation, the plans of the people of Bagdad. The oriental style of courts, should be coupled with our verandahs, securing us shade always. A5 Light moresco wings should enclose a central space, where we may rear shade and shrub trees, and find fragrance and shelter from the same sources. There is some talk of a fine hotel for the Island. Make it as fine as you please, but, above all, let it be suitable to the place and the season. Give it a noble court. Cover with it three sides of an open square, with a colonnade compassing the entire front, and a basement which would be cool always, spanned by ample arches. The buildings within the Fort are somewhat on this plan:—let the architect improve upon them. Editor.—All this is very good, Reverend Father; and no one doubts that art can so perform its offices, with nature, as to supply many of her defects. But I confess to a surprise, with the rest of the brotherhood, that, all on a sudden, our Island should be discovered to be a place of such admirable natural superiority. Now, I may claim to be tolerably familiar with it. Abbot.—Pshaw!—shooting curlews when you had nothing but the birds in eye and mind; or going down to a dinner party, when the great essential object of thought was C—'s wit, and C—'s champagne! On such occasions, let me tell you, men never look out for the beauties of a region. In fact, no man looks to make a discovery, unless first satisfied that a discovery is to be made. We undertake the search after neither a truth nor a beauty, unless first assured that they are in existence. This is a law of nature, requiring that the medium of search should first be in the mind, before the object ever grows up before the eye. Now, the very fact that you have never heard of the resources of Sullivan's Island, except as a place of health, is conclusive with you that it possesses none. It is thus that a man too frequently lives only in his great grandmother, and if she died without having known the virtues in a melon, he will be apt to grow up in the perfect conviction that a melon is nothing better than a squash. Editor.—Your zeal, Father, may make you eloquent, but not conclusive. Your sarcasm applies too generally, to fall with force upon any. Unhappily, the opinions which I have expressed, are universal with the brotherhood. Abbot.—Why not add—with the whole City? Editor.—And so I may! Abbot.—Ay, and so you may, and with propriety. A people who have done nothing but look abroad, and live abroad, all their lives, will be the last people to see anything worth looking at in their own provinces. Indeed, their justification for absenteeism depends entirely upon their assertion touching the deficiencies of home. What Irish nobleman or landowner, living in Italy, will admit any attractions in Ireland, except his rents? But, in arguing from our previous refusal to acknowledge the home attractions, in point of place and climate, you must go further. We happen not only to refuse our faith to the place, but to the persons. We do not believe in one another, my children. Pictor.—Fie, Father! Has our brotherhood done nothing to repair this evil? Was not our blessed and beloved order, the “Monks of the Moon,” created especially to teach this faith in one another. Abbot.—And what if we have done something towards it? Does this make against my argument? Enough, that the want of faith in the virtues of the race, was the pregnant deficiency of the community. It is still so to a most lamentable degree; and your questioning in regard to what has been alleged in behalf of the attractions of our Island, is simply illustrative of our pernicious local habit in every respect. You all persist in refusing to see the thing as it is. You refer me perpetually to the past. When I say, look at the loveliness of this harborage—look at at the green shores which gird it in—behold the proud fortresses which dignify and defend it—see the noble City, with its spires, rising, almost like another Venice, from the bosom of the deep; and see, where, at the very entrance to this beautiful region, lies an Islet by the sea, its broad, hard, sandy beach, glittering in the moonlight, and the glad waters subsiding to a musical rest upon its gently sloping shores:— when I have said and shown all this, what do you answer? Why—that your grandmothers lived here a thousand years, and never, in all that time, thought these things worth looking at. Beauclerk.—Ahem! Father, my grandmother was an honest woman. Abbot.—God bless her! Let her rest! We have not summoned her. Be not offended, my children. Ye are still in the shadows and depths of the valley of ignorance—ye are still steeped to the lips in the waters of prejudice and a narrow vanity—ye labor still under certain infirmities common to our city. Let us cure these infirmities if we can—let us couch this blindness if it be possible—and let us first begin, by dismissing from our lips those stereotyped laws of a very dull and purposeless convention, which have been ruling us too long. Our infirmity has grown out of too rapidly acquired affluence, under circumstance which can scarcely happen again, unless perhaps, in California. It may be, that, sixty years from the present time, there shall be on the waters of the Gila, a pet community. These shall constitute what will be called there the aristocracy. They will dine from plates of gold—they will revel in halls of marble—they will marry only among one another; and they will be acknowledged as the lords of the land. Your grandson will probably discover, among these people, the grandchildren of persons, who, in the old States, were not held worthy to unloose the latchets of your shoes. Yet, on the Gila, what airs will they take on! How they will swagger! They will realise a common history; they will despise the region where their fathers made their fortunes, and from which they still draw their resources: they will curse it by absenteeism; they will see nothing of its attractions; and will turn up their puppy noses at every argument which goes to show the treasures of their own homes. My children, we cannot well cure this disease in persons who are far gone with it. But, if possible, let us keep these people, the younger generations, from being inoculated. Now, I give you too propositions to chew upon. They involve the horns of a dilemma. A region will always represent its race: they will take their tone and coloring from its elemental aspects; they will be fashioned morally and mentally by its climate and its necessities; they will suit no other half so well. The other is like unto it. No individual is superior to his race. He is, perhaps, never more distinguished than when he represents the highest condition of its character and intellect. Very few do this. He, therefore, who believes neither in his place, nor in his race, is the worst of infidels—a besotted one—an ass that never sees his own ears— which I take to be the worst sign in the condition of such a beast. But is Pictor asleep? Pictor.—Only absorbed, father! —“Qual ne' tuoi dètti Magia s' asconde.” Abbot.—No blarney, Belial! Enough, that we both know who talks well. Why need we advertise unnecessary knowledge? Editor, (suddenly waking.)—Advertise, did you say? Eh! Ah! Proceed, good Father, I hear—I listen. Abbot.—What a heathen Greek it is! But I will not be confounded. I will proceed; for, in truth, I have something more to say. Beauclerk, (aside.)—When had he not? Abbot.—And now, my children, let me remind you of what the Germans tell us of “the open secret.” It is that secret which lies at the feet of every man; but which, by reason of his own blind follies, vanities, or prejudices, he can never be made to see. The bounty of God leaves no man without his treasure, would he only stoop to pick it up. Every land, in turn, has its own resources of wealth and beauty; nay, of enchantments; fairy climes, weird wonders, and spoils of magic, precisely as it hath resources of soil and fruitage. These, indeed, are its moral fruitage, which a race possesses only in degree with the exercise of its faith and courage. In the resources of the race, there is no stint of the individual. There is a wealth for each, in turn; but it can belong to him only who seeks to find it. The successful search naturally depends upon the conviction that we feel that the thing sought for is in existence. To him who searches with this proper faith, there are discoveries at every footstep. Hills that seem barren on the outside, have wondrous metals and minerals within. Rocks that frown in granitic grandeur, but strike them with the right hand and hammer, and they open straightway, and reveal beneath, the wondrous loveliness of articulate and living marble. Trees that bear no fruit to the eye, have yet strange, sweet singing birds, that harbor in their branches; and the dull clod, the seemingly unconscious plain of prairie, under the proper stroke of the wand, discovers the secret currents of pure and refreshing waters. But there must be a divining rod for the revelation of treasures. They belong only to those whom the slaves of the lamp and ring declare themselves willing to obey.— These find avenues among the hills, paths through the interminable thickets, forms of beauty in the cavernous rocks, and voices of rare melody in otherwise silent birds. These are your magicians. They possess what we may call, “The Home Secret.” These are the Genii of Art and Labor, who consecrate themselves to place; and unless these discover “The Home Secret” for a people, the race, after a certain period of gestation, must die out, failing their mission, like herbage that never reaches seed time. Such men constitute the genius of the nation. They are the first to discover what a people are, what they need, and what they may become. In short, they lay hands upon and develope the secrets of a country;—and every country has certain secrets peculiar to itself. For them, only, does Isis, the great Mother of Mysteries, remove her veil, and without falsifying the inscription on her shrine. They are not mortal. They sound the fathomless, they trace the pathless, they gather from all systems the blessings and the light, and preserve them for the benefit of one. And all this, my children, only because they look at home! It is in the very humbleness of their seach that they make their discoveries. Tell the vulgar man of morbid self-esteem, of some great wonder passing before him, and he elevates his eyes, and pitches his vision to the farthest possible point within his horizon; and all the while the great spectacle is passing at his very feet. The difference between the great and the little man is in nothing more remarkable than this. The former makes himself the master of his provinces; the latter seeks for servitude in the provinces of other masters. The mental forage of the one, can only be furnished in foreign pastures. He turns up his nose, with a nice antipathy, at the thing which grows beside his own doors. It is the noble duty of the other, which springs from an unselfish love —perhaps, in some degree, from an inevitable destiny—to labor ever in its proper cultivation. It is his pleasure to draw the novel from the familiar, the precious from the cheap, the rare from the common, the ideal from the actual. And these, by the way, are the greatest of all studies—the studies of the great in every age. Editor.—How little does the common mind understand this, particularly in the development of home treasures. Mere egotism and vanity, certainly, never find anything at home but themselves. How often have I heard the small author, in America, disparaging native art. Pictor.—Ay, and how often have I heard the native artist aver that he could never tolerate an American book. Abbot.—This is the weakness of persons, who, having acquired some position themselves, respectively, in their professions, presume in judgment, and claim a right to preside, as oracles, before they have earned the right, which sympathy alone can impart, to ask an audience. Their self-esteem blinds them to the fact, that such avowals of opinion are fatal to none more than to themselves. If the race is competent in one department, why not in another? If wanting in a literature or an art, why not in all? If not unendowed in one, demanding the same requisites of taste, fancy, imagination and thought, why should they be wanting in any province, which demands the exercise of B these agents? But the notion is an impertinence, as surely as it is an absurdity. The Providence of God leaves no nation utterly without the means, not only of its extrication and deliverance, but of its high moral and intellectual triumphs. The seeds of glory as well as life, are thickset in every land. There might have been poets, and artists, and philosophers, among the savage tribes of Apalachy and the Rocky Mountains, great as ever were produced among the fairest of the Caucasian tribes, had they taken the first step in the discovery of “The Home Secret.” But here was their difficulty, at their very threshhold—they had no homes. The history of a national progress to civilization may be comprised in few words. The first step is to make a people stationary. Slavery seems to be the only process for effecting this.— To be stationary, labor becomes inevitable, as the habitual law of life. Labor begets thought, training, method, morality and art, finally. These, in turn, beget the spiritual tendencies. From these come all the higher aims of the intellectual and religious nature. Editor.—Ah! but that first step! What a courage is implied in the voluntary assumption of the tasks of labor. One would think it necessary that a race should first be favored with an inspired man—a prophet as well as a master. Abbot.—And such is the master. The master of the Lamp and Ring, is endowed, no doubt, for his mission, if he be not false, like Balaam, to his duty. He must show to the nation what is lying at its feet, declare the uses of its own hands, unscale the domestic vision. There is a moral, no less than a physical near-sightedness, which is one of the prime sources of a national genius. There is nothing so sectional, so exclusive, as genius.— How Homer subjected the possessions of the world, to illustrate and make glorious his own tribes of island fishermen. How Shakspeare makes English every thing that he touches! What tributes have Burns and Scott drawn from the surrounding nations, with which to crown with verdure the bald, bleak hills of their own petty domain! And how natural that this should be so! Our affections and sympathies are of little use, scattered over all the dominions of mankind. We better prove our sympathies with the rest, when we attach ourselves to one of its sections, and expend our strength, our art, our affection upon that. Let the Genius Loci do thus always, and what region will remain without its tutelary god and crowning altars! It is in this very moral near-sightedness that we find the seeds of all true patriotism; all other is counterfeit and hollow. Without the representative genius which possesses it, and which asserts the right of a people to position, one race is simply the shadow of another. It is servile because purposeless—the creature of a foreign enemy, feeble with all it numbers, and flinging its misdirected arms in air, while its head is down, muffled, beneath the arms of a superior. Pictor.—Beauclerk sleeps, Father. Abbot.—Ah! I see! You have my benediction! Remember, we depart to-morrow by the last boat. Au revoir!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">B2 III. Omnes.—Welcome, Father, you are just in season. It is the last bell which you hear. Abbot.—As it should be, my children. I am never late, but love not to be too soon. Ha! who is this? our Poet, our Lopez de Vega? Whence come you, my son? Whither have you been? Poet.—To Georgia, Father. Abbot.—What, Rowland Springs? Poet.—No, indeed! I remembered too well your favorite maxim, never to go where all the world goes; in particular, to those places where we see little besides our own people. I have been on a visit to the wild places—the mountains, the rocks, the waterfalls, the Currahee, Tallulah, Toccoah. Abbot.—Ah, dog! But there rests against your name, in the records of the Monastery, a fine of a dozen of Champagne. You went without leave, after your usual fashion: without beat of drum; selfishly seeking pleasures which you were not disposed to share with your brethren. For my part, I can enjoy no pleasure unless I share it. I see but a small part of the beauties of the landscape, unless some dear one is nigh to partake my delight. Poet.—And it was with this very feeling, Father, that I went alone. I shall report their beauties and delights hereafter. Too much company spoils for me the charms of the prospect. There will be always some blockhead to cry aloud, at the moment when you are bathing in rapture— “What a glorious prospect!” Such people distress and sicken me. I seek to feed, and in silence—to feed the soul through the medium of the eye—and, at such periods, I care not to listen to the buz of human voices. I would hear no sounds save those which are properly kindred with the scene: the voice of the torrent, or perhaps of some grey eagle or lordly vulture, as he sweeps in mighty circles, and screams in unison with the hoarse roar of shrieking waters. Feeding thus alone, my digestion is always good.— The thoughts and fancies which I then enjoy are taken into the system, and become fused, as it were, with all the natural faculties. In after days they find utterance as a part, not simply of the scenery, but of myself. It is thus, and then, that I share all my delights with my brethren. I give them no crude exclamations. I give them the symmetrical conception—the full conclusion---the perfect wholeness of the prospect—with enough of myself, to enable them to determine to whom they should be grateful. To have them with me when I am studying my picture, is to endanger its propriety and symmetry. Their exclamations at such moments are as ungracious and intrusive as the interruptions, by the vulgar and pretending, of the favorite strain of music, breaking the symmetry of its finest parts, under the impudent plea of declaring their delight, and applauding the performer. Abbot.—You are ingenious and subtle, as usual contriving to rebuke your neighbor in defending B3 yourself. But do you class your fellows of the Monastery with the vulgar who are guilty of such monstrosities as those you describe? Do you hold us to be people of that order, who perpetually demand your opinions of what you see, and challenge your admiration of the things they affect to admire? Do we not all know what a fine and unusual prospect demands? Do we not know that nothing is more gradual in growth than the capacity for judging of the new and unfamiliar? Who sees all the charms of a picture, where the picture has anything in it, at a first glance? We must wait until our standards grow, as they do always if we give them time, from the survey of the scene itself; and nothing is more vexing or impertinent than the vulgar challenge: “Is'nt that beautiful?” from people who can scarcely tell an eagle from a cow, and know no more of poetry than a donkey. Verily, my son, your offence is great, if you confound the children of our beloved order with such miserable cattle. Poet.—It were a great sin, Father, were I guilty of this offence. I spoke in generals only. I have had the brotherhood gratefully in mind, during all my journey. It was to prepare the way for them, to make myself familiar with the terra incognita, that I might be useful in their guidance, that I went first alone. It was the first suggestion to our Brother, the Editor, upon my return last evening, that we should all visit together, the scenes which I have been compassing; for verily, Father, they well deserve the regards of our blessed order. In particular, Father, they appeal to thee! They will refresh thy fancies, they will stimulate thy imagination, they will fill thy mouth with good things, and thy youth will be renewed like that of an eagle, when he has bathed his pinions in the fountains of the Sun! Abbot.—Thou amendest thy error, child! We will think of this tour of survey which thou counsellest. It may meetly follow after our return from Sullivan's. They tell me much of these wild regions of our sister State. They speak of Tallulah as being a scene of great magnificence. Poet.—Equal, in most respects, to Niagara, Father. Abbot.—Ha! Poet.—More various and wild, full of beauties which Niagara does not possess, and of a grandeur little short of the awful glory, which is the charm and wonder of that great world-cataract. Abbot.—Toccoah? Poet.—Beautiful as a virgin's first dream of love. Beautiful as a nymph gazing into the maternal fountain. Abbot.—Son, we shall go thither on our return. But our boat is underweigh. Let us get to the bows. I like ever the forward prospect. Editor.—We owe much, Father, to Master Hillard, by whose enterprise frequent boats ply between the city, the island, and other places. He hath opened the way to Haddrell's Point. Abbot.—Drop the Point, I prithee! Why cumber the language unnecessarily? The place should be called “Haddrell” only. It is a good name,—sounding, without being affected or petty, and needs no addition. We have a most atrocious habit of finding bad names for good places, and spoiling them when they are excellent. We must clap on a ville or a ton, when there is no sort of necessity for it. How much do we improve Rutherford, as the name of a village, or Clinton, by mounting it with a rider? I abominate these terminations! How much better were Charleston, as Ashley, and Georgetown, as Winyah, instead of perpetuating clumsily, the memory of a Scotch-French profligate, or a Dutch-English-Hottentot! Hereafter, say Haddrell—the Point will be understood. Editor.—Ita lex. Beauclerk.—Certainly, for such a pretty city, Charleston should have a more appropriate uame. Abbot.—It is a pretty City! With a thousand deficiencies, it has yet a thousand attractions. Our egotism has led us to insist upon our moral qualities only; our graces of society, our frank hospitality; the elegance of our women, the high character of our gentlemen. These are things, certainly, of which we may be proud. But we have regarded these too exclusively, and have accorded nothing, or but little, to the physical beauties of our home. Certainly, no city could have been more happily seated. Two tributary rivers enclose her in their ample embrace. The ocean sweeps up to her very doors, making a grateful murmur at her portals, and bringing her the odors from a thousand islets of the deep. If she lacks a back ground. such as high mountains alone can bestow, she has a compensative beauty, thus rising nymph-like, from the very bosom of the waters. Had our architecture corresponded more with our situation, there would have been few cities along our Atlantic border to surpass, or even equal her, in beauty to the eye. But our buildings are generally very wretchedly conceived. Our architecture has been sui generis. It has borne no likeness to anything in heaven or in earth, or in the waters that surround the earth. Editor.—There is an improvement, Father. Abbot.—So there is! We have now some clever native architects, and they have done something already, and will do yet more. But a great deal is yet necessary. There is one important preliminary to be taught and felt, before we can do any thing successfully in this department,—namely, that every climate has its own requisites for building, and its necessities must determine the character of its structures. Now, instead of looking to Venice for our models in Charleston, we have been going back to the Greeks. The Yankees first fell foul of the Greeks, and made sad havoc of their mighty fabrics. A retired shopkeeper in Manhattan will build his kitchen after the plan of the temple at Icomium, and the model of the temple of Theseus, is the humblest that he could choose after which to plan the little structure at the extremity of his half acre lot, which, considering its uses, need not be seen at all. The passion for Greek models, for a season, spread here and there, and every where among us. And it was all a monstrous absurdity. We can admire the glorious fabric of Minerva, kissing the clouds from a lofty elevation of a thousand feet above the sea; but the same building, squatting down in the streets of a squat city like Philadelphia, is a manifest absurdity. These ambitious imitators over-looked the fact, that the Greeks planned their buildings for mountain elevations. They were made low and bulky accordingly, the mountain being, in fact, a great foundation pile for the edifice. To relieve the weight of the buildings they were surrounded by colonnades. If these colonnades were necessary to the relief of a building when on a mountain, how much more necessary on a plain? Yet, among us, the side columns, which were thus employed for the purpose of lightness and relief, have been knocked away entirely, and the density and dulness of the structure have been correspondingly increased. Our models should be found among the old states and cities, the sites and climates of which have some correspondence with our own. As I have already said, some good ideas might be got from the architecture of Venice —we might look also among the Byzantines,— and something quite as good might be gleaned from the abandoned stores of the Moors of Grenada—an elegant people; the atmosphere of their region resembling that of Charleston, if the scenery does not. I have no doubt that our best models would be found among the Saracens of the time of Abderrahman. They were a people accustomed to warm climates, of exquisite tastes, and a rare appreciation of all the luxuries of life. How they would have adorned that Battery!— What glorious courts, what delicately wrought columns, what umbrageous verandahs, what minarets and porches, with what a happy distribution of light and shadow, sparkling fountains and Mosaic avenues and pavements, to say nothing of the green relief from vines and festooning shrubberies, would they have made to crown that promontory, so beautifully placed at once for ostentation and enjoyment. There is a corner lot, one of the best, still remaining at the point of the Battery. I know not who owns it, or whether it remains in the hands of the city or not. If it does, let them sell it at any price, to some man of equal taste and wealth. Let him employ one of our excellent young architects, and let the space be crowned with a couple of light Moorish towers, connected with a court of columns opening on the south. The towers should be quite lofty. Indeed, to be light, they must be so. The basement should be sufficiently high to enable the architect to begin the real building at a point sufficiently above the line of the Battery, as to be distinguished—base no less than apex—from the sea. It was a sad error in those who built, having any part of the building below this line. This basement, given up to the offices, to kitchen, and even carriage house, would leave the lot, otherwise a small one, large enough for all purposes. Such a structure, judicionsly adapted, would give that finish to the Battery, which is at present its great deficiency. There is a new Custom House to be built. What a glorious chance here for a fine structure, looking loftily out upon the sea! And a model adapted from the architecture of the Saracens, would be of the very best sort, inasmuch as their style is susceptible of the most various application. Every requisite vault, office, court, or chamber, essential to such a building could be had; while the structure at the same time, would accord with and relieve the flatness of the sight, and could be adapted to soothe and disarm the oppressive languors of the climate. Editor.—We are passing Castle Pinckney. Do you remember, Father, whether that Fort existed in the Revolution? Abbot.—It did not. It was simply a marshflat, with very little soil, such as you see its unoccupied extremity now. I believe that its chief uses were as a place of execution. Remind me to ask our venerable friend, Dr. Johnson, if it was not there that Tweed and Ground water were hung. It was there, certainly, or at White Point. I believe that many of the Pirates, by whom our coast was haunted in ante-revolutionary periods, were justified at the spot now covered by the Castle.— What a pity that Government does not enclose and build upon the whole of this flat, making an ample Citadel, which, even if Charleston were in the hands of an enemy, could, if well provisioned, be held by five hundred men. Editor.—But its health is said to be doubtful. Abbot.—Would not enclosure, with a wall of stone, and filling up, render it healthy? Would it not have the effect also of contributing to deepen the channel and the harbor, by circumscribing the river, and preventing the wash from the shoals? Fort Johnson in the Revolution, was then employed to do the duty of Castle Pinckney; but it answered the purpose very imperfectly. Its guns failed to cover the ships of the British lying in Rebellion Roads.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">IV. Abbot.—You spoke justly when you bestowed a passing compliment upon Master Hillard, to whom our public owes much in the way of improvements. His “Line” is a good and useful one. The boats are sufficiently large, and, under existing circumstances, run sufficiently often, with a single exception, to the Island. There should be a night boat from the Island to the City, leaving at ten, and running while the weather is fine, and on moonlight evenings. The sweetest period of our day is from the approach of sunset, until the small hours of the night. Those who take a prolonged siesta, before or after dinner, will always remain bright and vigorous till midnight. Let me counsel this improvement, which must be equally grateful to monks, as to “maids who love the moon.” Editor.—He shall hear of it. Abbot.—Master Hillard hath done other things which deserve our countenance. He hath erred only in stopping just at the point where his greater exertions should have begun. I have no sort of question that Haddrell, with its groves opened fairly, and proper pathways smoothed along the sea, with ample grounds for exercise and sport, would, in these gloomy and perilous days, when cant and cholera assail us every where at the North, become quite as attractive and grateful to our people, as any of the thousand watering places which they rush abroad to visit. But money must be spent, and largely too, before the scene can be made what it should be. At the North, nobody thinks that nature can prove the sole attraction, without the help of art. They furnish her with all manner of assistants, and we must do the same, if we hope to rival the Yankees. It is enough if nature gives us the susceptibilities; we must do the rest. Our people have been spoiled with luxuries. They require easy carriages, fine steamboats, pleasant lounges, rich parlors, gay pictures, and the best of feeding. See how the small wits, who set out for our interior, professedly to see nature in her fastnesses, complain of their landlords, and the excess of lard in their gravies! We must provide for all this sort of people. To make Haddrell what it should to be, requires money. But I am free to say that, with money properly laid out, there would be few places better calculated to persuade the summer wanderer. Certainly it might be made a sort of Hoboken for us; a place where, of an afternoon, you might see hundreds from the city, young and old, taking the air along the shores, and sheltered from the sun, at the same time, by overhanging forests. Editor.—For an afternoon's exercise, or even for a day, the thing might answer. But there would be no stopping there at night. The Village of Mount Pleasant is healthy enough; but even at Shell Hall the case is very doubtful. Abbot.—I have heard so; but these statements rest generally on tradition. All newly opened places, in the low latitudes, are of doubtful health at first. But drainage, and free ventilage, by opening avenues through the forests, and clearing up the undergrowth, repairs the evil; and the children of the soil are as healthy as any others. We are too well disposed to believe these traditions in regard to the dreadful sickliness of places among us, which should be fostered rather than deserted, since this belief furnishes us with an excuse, which we desire, to get away. We find very poor people, who cannot leave the swamp neighborhoods, enjoying comparatively good health,—while their children flourish and fatten in spite of malaria. Charleston, itself, now one of the healthiest seaports in the Union, was, at one period, known as the American Batavia! What has wrought the change? What but drainage, ventilage, and a denser population, sufficiently numerous to work these improvements? So of many of our country villages. Orangeburg, for example, one of our oldest country towns, had the worst of reputations for its unhealthiness. It is now known as a summer retreat, equally healthful and agreeable. Haddrell is so situated that, with proper clearing and drainage, it cannot but be healthful. There are few influences from which malaria should arise. The winds, in summer, prevail generally from the South and Southwest; and all the places that are open as this is to the breezes from these quarters, are usually the healthiest among us. These winds sweep towards it from the open bay. The soil is little more than sand; the vegetation no where in the neighborhood, seems to acquire much rankness; and, all things considered, I fancy the tradition of its sickliness rests upon very doubtful authority. At all events, a little pains-taking ought to render it unequivocally safe and salubrious. What glorious bathing regions might be had all along these shores— Beauclerk.—But for the sharks! Abbot.—Confound the sharks! Do I tell you to rush into their jaws? I say might be had. Pillars made of our Charleston Cement, (Bowman's Concrete,) with stakes driven between, might be made to take in a vast extent of level beach. From this line of pillars and stakes, which effectually shuts out the sea attorney, you have only to stretch out awnings or tents of canvass: each family might have its own; and here Beauty might take her bath, in the embrace of Neptune, without even the eye of Apollo to disturb her security or compel her blushes. Editor.—Are you aware, Reverend Father, that you have been somewhat anticipated in your cogitations, touching the susceptibility of Haddrell as a place of afternoon resort for the goodly people of the City? Abbot.—Most likely! Great wits jump together you know. But what have you on this subject? Editor.—Some one of our hundred City Poets has touched upon the theme in one of the newspapers. I happened upon a fragment in an old sheet the other day. The writer describes the drives of some heroine, of whom the scrap which I happened upon could afford me no other information. But that need not affect us. The portions in point are these. You will see that the Poet has caught your idea with the most perfect accuracy. Abbot.—By anticipation. Proceed! Editor.—(Reads.) “She made the round of the Battery, twice or thrice, In this triumphant manner;—gazed about, And thought James' Island look'd exceeding nice, With its great crown of pines, so tall and stout; And wonder'd why we had no such device In Charleston, for its people to go out, In summer,—seeking still such pleasant places As Gotham keeps to cheer her mingling races. “There were the sister-islands, just at hand, Over that arm of Ashley and the bay; The drives are excellent along each strand, And sweet the beach where rolling breakers play; Between, are groves by ocean breezes fanned; Beyond, it must be very sweet to stray, To fields Elysian,—such as in New Jersey, Invite alike the folk in cloth and kersey. “We too might have—I speak it without joking— As sweet retreats for summer as the best; We might command our Brooklyn and Hoboken, Though no Wehawken crowns the Ashley's breast; Yet nature has for us some joys bespoken. Bright flowers, and forest shades our clime have bless'd, Deep Groves invite us, which, with little trimming, We might make precious for our babes and women. C “There's Haddrell, for example! Some slight clearing, The underwood removed from the old trees, And you might ramble onward, nothing fearing; Still looking out from Sullivan's to the seas; While birds above, and boats beneath you, steering, The languid spirits cheer, the fancies please; And, wanting rocks, instead of sybil cavern, Some Druid grot might answer for a tavern. “There Hillard might provide you with your ices, As well as Marion and Petit;—and there, He might contrive the prettiest of devices For tempting languid folks to take the air; Swings for the children—games at moderate prices, To keep the young from ill, the old from care; And show our Southern folks they need not wander, Northward, their joys to seek, their sixpences to squander.” Abbot.—Well read, Mr. Editor, a good song and well sung. The unknown rhymester hath anticipated all my philosophy. May our mutual counsels find their way to the thoughts of men of action, and persuade Mr. Hillard to do the thing handsomely. I am satisfied it will be done in process of time. Perhaps not many years will elapse, when we shall behold all these headlands, these green skirts of shore, crowned with beautiful villas, smiling through noble avenues of oaks, or decorated with drooping willows and redolent of myrtle and orange. It needs but an increase of manufacturing establishments near the city, and a large body of operatives who require to live free of the heavy burdens of city taxation, to make all these favored spots of nature flourish under the auspices of art;— and how lovely will be the coup d' æil when these shores are all handsomely studded with nice white boxes, with green blinds, and fancy pailings, even down to where the billows kiss the beach. Look about you, and behold! The tout ensemble, even now, is, to my eye, singularly beautiful. The expanse of bay is admitted to be a magnificent one. Before you lies the smaller space, crowned, on the one hand, by Castle Pinckney, on the other by Mount Pleasant; while, beyond, like a fairy empire, rises up Sullivan Island, sweeping round like a crescent, and circumscribing the area of water in its rear, so that it seems fitted, by its snugness and security, to be the proper abode of some such Lady of the Lake as beguiled the King of Scotland into the lowlier garments of the Knight Fitz James. To the right, as you gaze, how beautifully does the scene expand, smooth and blue, to the white beaches of James and Morris islands, upon which you behold, soft and slightly curling, a lengthened line of foam. The fortresses, Pinckney and Sumter, relieve the expanse of water of all monotony; and as the eye passes beyond, it rests with a sense of pleasure, natural to every such scene of quiet and delicacy, upon the lowly rising, but conspicuous cottages upon James Island, nor turns away dissatisfied from the undulating sand-hills that stretch outward to the sea. Back, you see where the Ashley opens—rounding the Battery, and sentinelled in its progress by that crest of pines directly opposite, which forms a peculiar feature of the scene. There the eye rests for awhile, reverting finally to the city, over which—her spires, smitten by the soft flush of a glorious sunset, beauty seems to hang, hushed and happy in the arms of peace. Turn we now to Cooper River, the Etiwan of the C1 aboriginal possessors---what a sweet and prolonged avenue of water, girdled by greenest slopes, by gentle headlands, its great trees stooping to the stream, and following all its sinuosities, as if guarding the shores with suspicious care against all intrusion. But we need not travel in this direction. Is it not all written in the Book of Irving?[1] [1] A Day on Cooper River. Poet.—It seems strange to me, venerable Father, that you have omitted to notice one peculiar and very pleasing feature in this landscape: I allude to the skirts of green marsh which relieve the eye on almost every hand, which contrast most lovelily with the waters, and soften, with the most delicate effect, the otherwise too bright glare of the sands beyond. There is an islet with a single oak, a mere hillock, rising from yonder bed of marsh, How pretty and pleasing the appearance. Follow the creek, now opening beneath the eye, and see where a troop of cranes are fishing in the shallows, their tall white forms showing brilliantly amidst their spaaious empire of waving green. We, perhaps, disparage the effect produced by these tracts of marsh, in consequence of ideas that belong to their supposed agency in promoting disease. I am satisfied that their noxious influences are much exaggerated. At all events, they add greatly to the picture—they seem absolutely necessary to its beauty, relieving its uniformity, and making it picturesque by the exquisite delicacy of the contrast. Abbot.—It is true that I had forborne the subject, but I had not overlooked it. It occurs to me as it does to you. You have so well expressed the thoughts proper to the additional effect, as to spare me the necessity of further remark. Something, however, in this connection, might be urged in regard to our low country scenery generally. But here we are at Haddrell. Do you know anything of the tavern kept here? Editor.—I spent a day not long ago at Shell Hall. It is kept by a worthy German, whose name I forget. He gave me an excellent dinner, very well dressed and served, and his demand was moderate. What with books and billiards, and delightful breezes, I spent the day most delightfully. Abbot.—We will visit him hereafter. Poet.—You were about to speak of low country scenery. It is the common practice to disparage it. Abbot.—Unjustly. Every thing in the prospect depends upon the mind of him who surveys it. The mind, and the sort of preparation and training through which it has gone, is the usual medium for making the survey. To the eye that looks only for its attractions in form, our scenery must always be unimpressive. But it is full of character, requires nice observation, and will reward close study. It depends for its effect upon the exquisite gradations of shade and color, the nice blending of tints, the harmony of its transitions, and, if I may so phrase it, a certain delicate intensity of life. It does not impose upon you, at a glance, like the scenery of the North, or our own back country. Its great deficiency is in form.---There C3 are no stupendous eminences—no frowning heights, that, rising up like giants, stretch themselves with their grey heads into the clouds, compelling the admiration of men, and seeming to challenge that of the gods. Our rivers run not through ledges of bald rock, that threaten momently to tumble headlong upon the hissing steamboat as it glides beneath. Our hills do not cluster together, bald and desolate looking groups, as if seeking alliance against the assaults of winter. Our outlines are neither startling nor imposing, but they are persuasive and grateful. They do not strike you at a glance, but it will please you in time to study them. Nay, they will reward study, when the object which depends for its effect upon mere outline, will provoke none. After all, your vast rocky or mountain pictures are very cold and cheerless. They strike you with awe, but they invite no sympathies. They demand your wonder, but they yield and expect no love. You see all their possessions at a glance—you feel that there is nothing in reserve. Beyond the grand, bold outline, they have no treasures. They move you at the first sight, but seldom reward a second; and the mind at length becomes discouraged and becomes discouraged and sad in their contemplation, and turns from them to the crowded city, as if seeking human association and relief. But the effect is far otherwise of our Southern slopes, our woods and waters. They do not strike you at first, and seldom startle, but, at the same time, they never offend. They rather woo and invite you by their soft attractions. You wander among their groves as you would among the enchanted bowers of an Armida. They tempt you to look out for enchantments. The brightness of their green, the wondrous luxuriance of their growth, the rich glow and glory of their flowers, the songs in profusion, and of every note, of their profligate birds—arouse the fancy, until the spiritual nature feels a flush of expectation, which gradually peoples the scene with fairy and imaginative creations. You are won away, unconsciously, into thoughts and musings which give a strange and sweet vitality to all that you behold. A thousand delightful meditations inform the mind, and you wander onward, soothed and satisfied with attractive fancies that give you the most appropriate companionship.— Nor is it the soft and gentle alone that is awakened in your nature by these scenes. They can impress with equal awe and solemnity. What more imposing spectacle than the dense pine forest, stretching away for leagues, a monotonous waste, like that of sea or desert, of unvarying forms—a realm of equal shadow and silence, gloom and deep, in which all the dwellers are crowned sovereigns— sovereigns without subjects,—voiceless, hopeless, heirless—without speech, without communion— waving to and fro their inexpressive heads, with one unbroken swing of solemn idiocy! What more wondrous and awful, than the very waste fertility of our mighty swamps—shrined in flowers, wrapped in beauty, gorgeous in natural wealth, rich in all shapes and colors, wondrous in vine, and wreath, and jewel—terrible in the startling beauty of their reptiles, in the scream of their C4 mighty birds, in the awful majesty of their deep recesses? Their buds press your cheek as you go forward—their vines stretch forward with a thousand fingers to wind you in their grasp—your footsteps crush perfume from their leaves—your fingers are crimsoned with the delicious juices of the wild grape—and life, in forms the most magical—and loveliness, in gleams the most musical— are ever rising to the senses, as if to persuade the faith into those ancient fancies, which never left such regions without their elves and fairies. The deep impenetrable thickets skirting the narrow river or oozy lake, seem the very regions of ambush and surprise; and you look momently to see the feather-cinctured warrior darting out from the shad, in all the panoply of forest warfare. A gloom, which is not painful, gives a mysterious tone and character to this peculiar realm of loveliness and life, and the very droplets of sunlight that fall and trickle through the tree tops and shrubbery upon the earth below, seem so many wandering shadows—shapes of spiritual life—that come only to declare that, however little sought or beloved by man, the region is not yet utterly abandoned of Heaven. Editor.—Take my arm, Father: we are at the Island.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">V. Abbot.—My children, the day is over, and all things are quiet now. The Island sleeps—the people—all but ourselves. Bring your chairs out upon the beach. We will sit upon the solid gray sands, at the very edge of the waters. Let us have a table, and bring out a bottle of Champagne, that our spirits may be refreshed. Editor.—But, Father, what will people say? Abbot.—Let them say! So long as we offend none of God's ordinances, and violate none of the laws of the land, let the fools's tongue wag as it pleases. It is one of the curses of the community that we perpetually ask what our neighbors think of us. Vanity forever asks the question, and, in doing so, shackles human freedom. Commend yourselves to your own consciences, my children, and be at peace. It is surely something wonderfully distressing to our little world, that we, the Children of the Moon, venture to pitch our tents upon the beach, and sit beneath the blue arch of. Heaven, instead of the rude rafters of Mrs. Cheney or Mrs. Stevens. Editor.—Not that exactly, Father; though that is something new in this region. But the Champagne! Abbot.—My son, drink you none of the beverage if you fear it, or your neighbors. It is a proper prudence that children should not play with edged tools. But we who know the uses and C5 the virtues of the thing, need not be so scrupulous. Editor.—But your example, Father. Abbot.—Would be bad, perhaps, if we drank more than a bottle, or more than our heads could bear. But such is not the case. If men never trespassed beyond our limits, there would be no sorrow from intemperance in the land. At my age, with the habits perfectly formed—and these are among the best securities of character—I may surely be presumed to be safe in my indulgencies. Editor.—But the world will doubt. They will suspect us of excesses. They will know nothing of our limits. Abbot.—Then is the world a transgressor. The good Christian is bound to presume favorably of the practices of men, when he knows nothing against them. If he does not, his Christianity is at fault. Editor.—Public opinion, Father. Abbot.—Is too frequently insolent, under the pretext of virtue. Be at ease, my son; or if thy doubts trouble thee, retire to the dwelling and refresh thee, by way of quieting them, by drinking a few goblets of cool ice water. Meanwhile, thou shalt have our prayers. I tell thee, my children, there is something petty and peevish in the habits of this little community of ours, whenever it comes to sit in judgment upon its neighbors. Every departure from the beaten track, receives its condemnation from some upstart fool, no matter whether the innovation be a virtue or a vice. We are such miserable slaves of convention, that we crush all individuality as a crime; though, in the exercise of this very individuality, we find the source of all great virtues. What are great heroism, great self-sacrifice, world-blessing charity, but depantures from the common practices? We have got into a world of humdrum here in Charleston, from the uniform monotony of our habits. You cannot change the style of your dress in any respect, but you see stupid wonder opening its great eyes, and silly conceit stretching wide its broad grinning jaws, as if something enormous had taken place. The old gentlemen begin to fancy some revolution at hand, as did the Usher in the time of Louis the Fourteenth, when he saw a nobleman enter the royal presence with strings instead of buckles to his shoes. A summer ago, I went into one of the manufacturing establishments of the North, and groped through a great collection of hats. I desired one, which should be light and soft—which should not bind the head, or be burdensome to the brain. I got me something which answered my purpose exactly. It was fashioned somewhat like the old Cavalier's hat, of the time of the Stuarts, high crowned and slouch brimmed. But you have seen the hat, my children. Beauclerk.—Did not the brotherhood adopt it, Father? Abbot.—Well, what was the consequence? All Charleston was aghast when they beheld it.— `What!' said one of our habitues to me, the day after my arrival, `do you expect to force such a hat upon the people of Charleston?' I fear me that I answered somewhat irreverently, with regard to the good people of Charleston. `Let them wear what they please,' was my answer, `but pray you suffer me to do the same.' It is, perhaps, the most striking symptom of feebleness, a regard for petty objects only, and an incapacity to rise to the consideration of more important concerns, that people should waste breath upon costume at all. I can respect the Turk who has a national dress, which, once established, and suited to his climate and his occupations, becomes a thing unchangeable by fashion, and is no longer a subject of speculation. When Mahmoud, in his blind zeal for reformation among his people, beginning at the tail, rather than the head, proceeded to clothe his troops after the manner of the Franks, I was prepared to believe that he was not the man to effect any good for his people. And he did not. His whole labors were a miserable failure. My sons, I pledge you in this generous beverage. It commands itself gratefully to the veins of an old man. Beauclerk.—An old man, Father. Abbot.—Seventy, at least, my son. Beauclerk.—Impossible! Abbot.—To those who count life by years, my children, quite impossible. But you will not have forgotten the line of our gentle Latin poet—`Actis ævum implet, non segnibus annis! Change the deeds to events, and the reading is admissible, and the application is correct. A man lives in his experiences. If to have seen, in a single year, most of the sorrows that range through a life of seventy; if to have broken all the ties that bind to friends and kindred, in that short space of time; if to have seen one's graves growing around him—the graves of several generations at once—while he is yet in the green of life, and ere his sinews have well hardened into manhood; if, in addition to this, to have seen the wreck of all one's earthly fortunes, almost of his hopes;—be the usual experience of seventy years, why should I not count mine at this number? For such has been my experience. Editor.—But scarcely one among us, Father, wears more the aspect of youth than yourself. Abbot.—Many a great oak waves a massive coronet of green, my children, into whose core the worm has eaten, and upon which it preys ever more, without ceasing. It is pride—possibly, a nobler feeling—that stifles the pain of its secret hurts, and makes no outward confession of its malady. But some one walks along the breakwater. He stops, as if to muse upon the prospect. He drinks in its beauty, in loneliness. There is a something in the scene which is refreshing to the soul, and most men who think, need to refer often to the refreshing influences of nature. There are some men who have pleasure in no other communion. I often meet with such men. I have one in my mind's eye at this moment. You must all have seen the man. He is known to us for large and various endowments, classical acquirements, excellent taste, and a spirited and glowing style in composition; but you meet him nowhere in society. When you see him he generally walks alone, and then not often in the public thoroughfares. He goes abroad towards nightfall, and his eyes are cast upon the ground as he walks, or his vision pierces into space; but he looks not about him for his fellow, and he asks no man's communion. What is the secret sorrow of this man: what his troubled dream; what his defrauded hope? Who shall tell? Is it a peculiar nature, an idiosyncracy, that wraps itself up in loneliness, as in a garment, brooding upon its own heart, and not attuned for the communion of any other; or is it the result of a life-disappointment, the overthrow of a great and generous ambition, which makes him feel, possessed as he is of the best treasures of literature and of a world-sufficing mind, scornful of the very possessions which are the envy of other men? My children, most men who seek for solitude have great sorrows which they are doomed to nurse in secret. Yonder stranger may be one of this description. But for this doubt, we should ask him here among us. Abbot.—And such is not our custom, Father. Abbot.—Here again starts up the shadow of that conceited convention, which chills humanity and denies sympathy to our neighbor. It has always struck me as a delightful characteristic on the Continent of Europe, particularly among the Germans, that, sitting beneath their shade trees, dancing at evening, or quaffing the generous juices of their grape, they entreat the passing stranger to their festivities, and make him one of them at once. What should they fear? Beauclerk.—The contact with the vulgar. Abbot.—True superiority has no such fears. Vulgarity never shows itself on such occasions. The rude man takes his tone from the social circle which admits him, and adopts his new standard with a wonderful instinct. He is charmed by the complacency of the superior, and he never trespasses upon the proprieties, which stand like so many guardian watchers around the happy company. We gain nothing by our coldness. We may lose much by our reserves. In this way, we are told, by the highest authority, that the host has frequently entertained an angel. For my part, travelling as I have done, among the wildest regions of the South and West, at periods when they were a thousand times, wilder than now, I have never encountered anything but kindness and hospitality. I seldom took with me any other weapon than that which best suits the traveller— good humor. I have met roughness which springs from ignorance, and not from ill-nature; simplicity, but that which never vexed either a taste or a judgment, regulated by a just sense of the circumstance or the situation; and a frankness that requires only to be met with a corresponding spirit, to become a lasting and pleasant, if not a profitable, friendship. Yet, ordinarily, the city-bred gentleman, full of his conventional laws, and not able to overcome old habits, or perhaps not capable of perceiving their unsuitableness to his present condition, seldom succeeds in winning the confidence and sympathy of the forest-bred inhabitant, or the rugged mountaineer. He will cherish his old strut, and his new waistcoat, and be at particular pains, always to remind the peasant, that he is a citizen; the very thing he should avoid. Poet.—Father, the City makes a very lovely picture now. The moon touches those steeples with the prettiest frost-work; and the metallic shaft of the new Church in Wentworth-street, flashes out at intervals with the happiest effect. Abbot.—Yes, there are subjects all around us for the pencil of Pictor. He is meditating some of them now. Fort Sumter, by moonlight, would make a conspicuous object; with the foreground spreading from the beach at our feet, while in the background sweet fairy-like glimpses might be had of the village on James Island; a point further west might enable him to bring into a corner of the picture the crest of pines of which we have spoken already, and of which Trouche made an excellent portrait. His error was in reducing the extent of water stretching from the Battery to the Island. A glimpse of the Battery might also be included in a wing of such a landscape. I confess that I nowhere have seen prospects more lovely than such as are afforded from the spot where we sit, in a moonlight view. Mind you, I do not say grand or even impressive, though in a storm the same prospect would have its grandeur. But sweetness, the charm of delicate repose, a fairy-like vale of shining sands, green glimpses and shores, that seem to steal upon you, relieved by occasional objects, such as Fort Sumter and Castle Pinckney—these are all present, and actively appeal to the fancy for the moral adjuncts. Besides, there is the aid of ship and steamer, now looming up white with bellying canvass, or lazily rocking at anchor, as if lulled into repose by the seductive calm of winds and ocean. Poet.—What a glorious spectacle in a storm must these seas present—the great billows rolling in upon the beach, threatening destruction—sworn, as it would seem, to overwhelm the crouching, shuddering houses, yet subsiding, smoothing down their haughty crests, as they encounter with the steadfast sands. Abbot.—I have witnessed just such a spectacle. It was in the summer of 18—, I forget the year. I can never remember dates. The Island was fairly flooded. People fled to the upper stories of their dwellings, or to the Fort, for shelter. I had my fears; for winds and seas seemed both to have conspired for our destruction. The Gulf appeared to have risen in fierce hostility, and was pouring in upon us with its thousand squadrons of blue and foam. Never did I behold such great and threatening billows. As you beheld them rolling forward, you involuntarily crouched, expecting them upon you. Mountain after mountain, far higher than any dwelling upon the Island, came tumbling headlong forward; and just when it seemed inevitable that we were to be engulfed, they would encounter with the shoal, and with a hoarse groan would part, scatter, subside, and roll upward upon the shore, covering it with their waters, but no longer embodied in mighty and overwhelming masses. The change of wind only saved us. Terrible was the evening and the night of that fearful day. I shall never forget the spectacle, which a painful sort of fascination made me eagerly contemplate, in spite of all my apprehensions. Poet.—I remember to have heard just such a description. There were lives lost on that occasion, Father. One fair creature. D Abbot.—Yes! Yes! The event haunted me for long seasons after. It troubled my dreams, and furnished the materials of one of them, which so impressed my imagination that, for a moment, I ventured to usurp your lyre, my son, and shape the oppressive fancies into verse. Poet.—Let us have it, Father. Abbot.—Surely! I have no affectations; and there is something classical, you know, in declaiming by the shores of the sea to the music of the billows. Homer, on the Chian Strand, must have experienced a joy in doing so, apart from his audience, in hearing the murmur of the waters which he could not see. Editor.—And Demosthenes. Abbot.—I doubt if Demosthenes felt any of the poetry of the situation. Softness, or the sense of beauty, was not his province. But we need not these or any examples to justify us here. If there were any scruples, it might be that a diseased self-esteem, trembling at your conventional usages, might suggest that some of the lodgers at Cheney's are awake. In their charity, they would suppose us mad, or drunk, to hear our recitations. They certainly would never be liberal enough to suspect that the spirit of Homer or Demosthenes had been the source of our inspiration. And now, children, remember that these are boyish verses, written twenty years ago. Poet.—We listen, Father. Abbot—(Recites.) I dream'd that I was walking by the sea, Whose billows, forced by winds of Mexico, Brought in the dark blue waters of the Gulf Close to my feet. The breaking surges dash'd In white foam round me; and a solemn song Rose from the gathering ocean, which, at hand, Hung threat'ning, as if challenging for prey, The shores on which I stood. A narrow ledge— A low frail barrier 'gainst a foe so strong— Its own bright tribute, from the heaving deep, Laid at the city's foot—as if to check, The wild, free progress of its reckless mood,— Offer'd but feeble foothold, to the crowd, Now crouching in their terrors. Soon, the waves Come rushing upward; while the shores grew faint, And buried their gray heads. A bird of wo, Scream'd overhead in warning,—then flew off, In dread,—and, with example, counsell'd me To my own safety. On each hand, the seas Rear'd their green crests, and, backward as I fled, Their tongues pursued me with a gushing hiss That threaten'd fiercer speed. The summer homes Of the affrighted Islanders were gain'd, And the wild waters, rushing in with roar, Drove them to upper chambers, or the sands, That sunk beneath them. Death was in the wrath Of those wild torrents! Death upon the winds, That gave the torrent wings;—and sights, and sounds— If sight were in the blackness of that night, Or sounds in that one thunder of the wave— Spoke only, and spoke equally, for death! Thus seem'd his empire certain—and we fled, A mixed despairing multitude! The weak, Shrieking, unnoted, in the ocean's roar, Vainly, for succor from that human strength, Which then was strength no more! There was a pile, A stern, strong fortress, that, beside the deep, Stood guardian of the City. It had borne The storm of iron in the perilous hour, Rearing its brows in conquest, and with pride, D2 When the long day was ended. Thither, then, We fled in safety. We had fled in vain, But for the victim! There was one, devote That hour, to destiny!—and the wild seas Rush'd still insatiate on, with outstretch'd jaws, And had not been appeased—we had been lost— But quickly, from the crowd, a sheeted form, Sprang out to ocean! Suddenly, a light, Flash'd from the sated Heavens—and we beheld Each feature of the victim. Young and fair— A maiden in her budding. Pale, but bright, Her cheeks were whiter than the drifting foam That broke around us. In her lovely eyes The light seem'd holy, and bestow'd on all A delicate lustre. But a moment more, Its lambent beauty cheer'd us, while she sprang, Tossing in air her slender and white arms, That soon embraced the billows. Down she sank; And there was from the shore and from the seas, A mutual cry—the one of a deep wo, The one of triumph! And the storm was hush'd In that same instant! Sullen from the shores The waves went backward with a murmuring song, And slept upon the deep. The ravenous sea, Having its prey, grew calm; and all was peace, Where all awhile was fright. But in my dreams I yet behold that maiden, with her arms So white and slender, tossing in the waves, That sucked her down forever in their gulfs. And now, my children, shall we walk? Leave chairs and table, they are safe, and let us take the beach till twelve.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">VI. Abbot.—Here we are at the beginning, the present terminous rather, of the Breakwater. The rocks afford us a pleasant range of seats. The point is a good one for affording grateful glimpses of the prospect. Behind us lies the fortress, Moultrie, in still and beautiful repose. Before us rises Fort Sumter, looming us gracefully in the moonlight. To the left you behold the uniform revolutions of our Light House Star, shining, like the smile of Hope, to the lonely wanderer, over the multitudinous waters. The South line is beautifully bounded by the shores of James's Island, and the eye, bending upon the West, loses itself happily among the infrequent lights of the distant City. Let us sit, my children, and enjoy the delicious charm of a prospect, which unites sweetness with solitude, and the breathing hush of nature with her tenderest beauties. Editor.—The Breakwater seems to have admirably answered the purpose for which it was designed. For this part of the Island it has certainly done wonders. Our beach had been nearly swept away in this quarter. I have seen the billows breaking against Fort Moultrie itself; and, it is said that a portion of the wall was undermined by the ocean. Yet now, what a wide interval stretches between the fortress and the sea, and the sands are hourly accumulating. The old line of rocks, laid down originally from the Fort, when the effort was first made to arrest the ravages of D3 the sea, is now nearly obliterated by the sands; and the beach, from this point at least, to the extremity of the Island, is, it strikes me, even increased in breadth, infinitely beyond what it was twenty years ago, when I remember the drives along the whole front of the Island, as in admirable perfection. Abbot.—Such is my impression also. The loss is on the inner quarter of the southern exposure. Is this loss final? The breakwater precludes the hope of again enjoying a beach drive in this direction; yet is it so certain that the deposits from the sea will not form a new beach without the breakwater? Is not the shoal increasing at the point of junction between the back beach and the front, and will it not continue to accumulate when the stone work is completed? The channel seems to me to be destined to be circumscribed in width, while it gains in depth. The mole on which Fort Sumter is raised, will tend necessarily to throw from it the press of water, on the one hand; while, on the other, the stone line, stretching from Fort Moultrie along the southern shore of the Island, to its extremity, must serve, in like manner, to break and defeat the action of the billows on the opposite side. The agitated waters will leave their deposits, which must gradually accumulate against the breakwater, and, in process of time, the beach may be renewed along the entire southern front of the Island. Beauclerk.—It is doubtful, Father, whether this will be desirable. The result might be productive of other consequences, not the most agreeable. The formation of a new beach without the breakwater, might prove an obstruction to the departure of the waters which now accumulate within. These now afford the most admirable bathing places to the inhabitants. Nothing, indeed, could be more admirable. The ground floor of the bathing place is the most natural slope in the world. You pass, inch by inch, from a depth not over the latchet of your shoe, to your armpits. The child of two years old may bathe in security, while the athletic swimmer may wanton in the most vigorous wrestlings with the billows. The effect of any accumulation of the sands without, would, probably, turn this inner body of water into a lake, which might become a marsh. It is a question what contribution of its sands is made by the higher portions of the Island towards filling up this basin; and whether this filling up within, will keep pace with the accumulations without. Abbot.—Sufficient for the day is the evil thereof. The progress of events must be watched, and openings made in the stone at proper intervals, for the free intercourse of the fresh billows with the waters which remain within. It may be necessary, a hundred years hence, to carry the breakwater out a hundred yards farther. In that event, my son, the subject is one which we may commend safely to the consideration of our great-grand-children. Editor.—I could have wished that the plan of the breakwater had contemplated the enclosure of the shoal at the Point. An obtuse angle, thrown out, and returning, at this quarter, would have D4 given a good finish to the work; would have increased the territory somewhat; and the proprietor at the Point might have thrown above the stone reservoirs, thus created, some such light and graceful specimen of Moresco architecture, in the shape of a bathing house, as you have previously described. If Sullivan's Island is to continue to increase in popularity and population, as it has done— bringing from the interior, with each returning summer, the elite of our Middle and Up-Country Planters and Professors—we shall need all the bathing places we can find. These must be covered also, since it will be impossible to enjoy the tides during the day without such exposure to the sun and eye, as few persons, properly educated, are willing to incur. Besides, sea bathing in perfection should be taken in puris naturalibus. We should strip to it as to any other pleasure. This bathing in the obstructions of breeches and petticoat, shroud and wrapper, is not only a very unnatural, but a very uncomfortable way of doing the business. Beauclerk.—I like the idea of tents for each family pitched within the breakwater. Editor.—Why not neat, light, graceful fabrics of wood, with ornamental roofs, Saracen or Chinese. Beauclerk.—Pagoda fashion? Editor.—Yes! Just showing above the line of stone, like so many nice little turrets. Abbot.—No doubt something will be done to meet the wants of the community, and satisfy the requisitions of propriety and taste. The subject, I am told, is in good working hands. A working man is almost inevitably an improving one. The erection of this Hotel is the first step; and a first step is usually half the journey, as a first blow is half the battle. Let the virtues of the Island be once made known to the interior, and you will find that they will be acknowledged by our own citizens. Men who plodded annually to that vulgarest of all social places, Saratoga—whither every poor devil was sure to go, who could raise a couple of hundred dollars—will then begin to discover that Sullivan's is a much more famous place than Saratoga. That it is a thousand times finer place, any one who is capable of judging must readily acknowledge. Besides, it has advantages of a much higher social tone than is to be found at any of the summering places at the North, unless perhaps Newport; whither our Southern gentlemen have been so much in the habit of going, as, necessarily, to have carried with them the delicacies and refinements of good society. Here, the intercourse with a large city is hourly—the voyage short between the two places—the expense of transit a trifle, which, with competition—which I am told is threatened—and an increase of population on the Island,—must be made still lower. There are the markets of the city at your service; all the resources of the city—books, society, amusements; and you may even see, in process of time, the theatrical entertainments of the city, during the winter, transferred to a summer theatre upon the Island. In brief, you may command all the pleasures and advantages of a large city, with all the quiet, repose D5 and health of a country seat, and place of summer refuge. You shall escape the cares of the town— its anxieties, heat and dust, without forfeiting any of its pleasures. Beauclerk.—What is the length of the Island? Editor.—From three to four miles. The width seldom quite half a mile, and frequently little more than a quarter. The beach drive is estimated at two miles and a half in length, and, in width, at low water, from fifty to an hundred yards. As you see, from the Fort to the end of the Island, it is such a beach as you find nowhere surpassed on the whole Atlantic coast. Beauclerk.—Shall we walk it to-night, Father? Abbot.—I think not, my son. We may try it to-morrow. For the present, I prefer that we should meditate, rather than explore. We may drink in pleasure enough from the scene, by simply unfolding ourselves to it. You see our Poet and Painter, as they lie there, stretched out on the very brink of the breakwater. The ocean breaks beneath them, sending the cool spray, glittering like diamond dust in the moonlight, on their cheeks and bosoms. Yet they heed it not. They seem to feel it not. They are brooding, almost unconscious, it would seem, in emotions which they cannot now express. Some of these days, it may be a year hence, you will see a painting, or hearken to a poem, which will bring all this scene before your eyes. Beauclerk.—Certainly, Father, there is much that is strangely beautiful in the scene, but much that is cheerless also. Those heavy white hills of sand have the ghostliest appearance, and there is something saddening to my sight, even in the grouped palmettoes which stand up, knee deep, in the great grey hillocks. Abbot.—What would you have, my son? Would you have the season always winter, or always spring; the scene always green with grass and shrubbery, and crowded with forest trees! This is only one of the thousand aspects of the various Nature. She puts on new forms and features, accommodating herself to all the tastes, and all the necessities of men. Here, you behold her, in one of the earliest processes by which she shapes a habitation for the race. Where we stand, was once the empire of ocean. She hath plucked this lovely place from his domain; she hath reared it above his head, as a barrier to more valuable empires; and thus roling his billows, forever restless, against its modest shores, he seems to assert his possessions, and to seek their rescue from the usurper. You must look upon this scene with feelings accommodated to the season of the year, the temperature, the circumstances of the city, your own exhaustion in its daily toils, and the desire which you feel to escape to places of refuge in the enjoyment of novelties. The Island is sterile, but who comes here to plant? It is treeless, but cool nevertheless. These breezes, and such nights, compensate for all deficiences of shade and forest. The music of these solemn sounding billows, the beauty of this silent and spell-imploring spectacle of sky and sea, and this verdureless domain of sand, furnish the sensibilities and the imagination with an empire no less grateful than unique. One sleeps with a rare sense of pleasure, having in his ears, in the last moment of consciousness, the rolling murmur of these waters breaking heavily upon the shore. Editor.—But it is a mistake to speak of the Island as verdureless. There are farms and gardens above, which show equally the taste and skill of the cultivator, and the susceptibilities of the soil. Clumps of cedar, of oak, and of laurel, gay shrubs and fragrant myrtles, rise up among the sand hills, giving you the oase amidst the desert, and affording, on a small scale, some idea of that which is so gateful to the traveller in the mighty empires of the desert in the East. Truesdell, of oyster excellence and memory, has acquired high renown as an island farmer. He makes sea and shore equally tributary to his objects. One foot he plants in a field of okra, another in a field of oysters. The ocean breaks between his legs without disturbing his securities. He looks on the right hand and on the left, and feels that he is monarch of all he surveys. He has been a patriarch to the oyster family. It is wonderful how they have flourished under his auspices. He has shown the wonderful powers of education, for the development of dormant faculties. He has taken the unsophisticated muscle from his native bed, where he crouched and lived, rather than grew and flourished, and has given him a knowledge of the world. His proteges, under his benignant care, have grown to enormous sizes. That he should require that they should yield of their annual growth for the reward of their benefactor, is but a reasonable appeal to their gratitude. How little do the gourmands at Columbia, during the Legislative session, conjecture the toil, the care, the watchful anxiety with which he has reared these young and artless creatures, that they may minister to the delights and appetites of the Statesman and the Politician, exhausted by the toils of office and the constant draughts, upon their wisdom and patience, of a not easily satisfied constituency. Truesdell deserves well of the Legislature, Father. Abbot.—They tell me his Oyster Beds are no more safe than those of New Jersey. Report says that he has had to watch them nightly, at low water, with a loaded blunderbuss. Editor.—Very probably. It is difficult to teach a negro that a property can be had in an oyster before he is gathered; and, assuming that Truesdell planted his oysters, benevolently, and with no other object than the good of the oyster itself, Sambo and others of his tribe, conceived that his sole object was reached when the young creature had attained a marketable size. It cost the excellent proprietor, I am told, a matter of ninety dollars in advertisements against trespassers—announcing and setting forth his rights; sixty in blunderbusses and pistols, and some thirty more in shot and powder—to say nothing of the anxiety and loss of rest—in keeping his proteges from abduction. Statutes have not saved him always. Abbot.—Truesdell is a benefactor my brethren. If the man may be considered so who makes two blades of grass occupy the spot which originally could rear but one, he certainly deserves as much who can convert a racoon oyster into a Blue Pointer, or a Shrewsbury. We owe something of gratitude to Truesdell. Something is due also to the oysters. They have done the State some service. Monuments have been built to thousands whom we could have much more readily spared, and who have been far less gratefully swallowed. Beauclerk.—Talking of monuments, Father, reminds me to ask whether the name of the man from whom the Island takes its name was not O'Sullivan. Abbot.—It was—Captain Florence O'Sullivan. He seems to have been for a time a sort of Alexander Selkirk. His title to the Island must have come from simple occupancy. The first account of him, given in the history, is that which occurs in Hewat. It appears that, during the administration of Sir John Yeamans (who succeeded to Sayle, the first Governor,) the colonists were on the eve of civil war. The Government was feeble, and the colonists quite unequal to their own defence against the Indians. Their supplies from Europe had failed them, and they became seditious. The settlement at Charleston was about to be involved in bloodshed. At this juncture, it appears that Florence O'Sullivan had charge of a post upon the Island which mounted a single gun. This was probably mounted in a block house rather than a Fort; and the block house was probably framed of Palmetto logs, affording the suggestion, in after times, for the construction of the fort, made famous by the battle with the British fleet. It may have occupied the self-same spot. Capt. O'Sullivan's command may have consisted of half a dozen or a dozen men. He was stationed here, rather to give notice to the town of the approach of suspicious vessels, than expected to offer any very serious defence. At this period, it must be remembered, that the coasts were covered with the pirate craft of all European countries. Capt. O'Sullivan became impatient of the inferior duties which had been assigned him. He shared in the discontents of the people; and, being, as we infer from the name, a son of Green Erin, he was not to be kept from the fun when a fray was in progress. He deserted his post upon the Island, hurried up to the town, and took the command and direction of the insurgents. But O'Sullivan was premature. The fruit was not quite ripe. The Governor maintained his ascendancy, and the worthy Captain was arrested on a charge of sedition, and compelled to give security for his future good behaviour. The history tells us no more of Florence O'Sullivan. Our provincial records might supply the deficiency, and we recommend to some of our young lawyers, who have not yet found the business of an approaching term too oppressive, to look through the documents of the State Department. I confess to only a vague notion of the tenure by which he conveyed the Island to the good people of Charleston. Editor.—The inquiry deserves to be made. We owe something to O'Sullivan, which we have doubtfully acknowledged by stripping his name of its Hibernian prefix. Still it is doubtful if we could well avoid it. Something is due to euphony, and the “O!” would scarcely help the name at present. I wish we could restore the aboriginal name of the Island. What will they call the new Hotel, I wonder? It will not do to say “Sullivan's Island Hotel.” nor is it altogether complimentary to a hero to call a Hotel after him. Besides, the Fort already bears the name of Moultrie. Abbot.—The subject is a nice one. Beauclerk.—“What's in a name?” Abbot.—Much: in spite of Shakspeare, names are things. The christening is one calculated to give trouble, and leave some parties still dissatisfied. I could wish to see the old Indian names restored. They were eminently musical and suitable; and if their meanings are not so obvious at this day, they would certainly labor under no worse disadvantage than attends half the names that we employ. For the settlements here, the names of Moultrie and Pinckney have been appropriately chosen. They are words of meaning in association with the scenes which they honored by their valor. I could also wish that the name of Col. Thomson, who had charge of the defences at the eastern end of the Island, on the famous 28th of June, could be also, in some way, distinguished by a local appropriation. But I abominate the absurdity which persists in tagging the names of Moultrie and Pinckney with the French ville. What use? Why not simply Moultrie and Pinckney? the village is understood. Should another village spring up in this wide waste tract between the two villages, I trust that our Colonel from St. Mathews and his sharp-shooters, will be remembered, and the new settlement be called St. Mathews or Saint Thomson.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">VII. Editor.—It is mentioned, Father, that the present Fort does not occupy the site of that of Revolutionary memory. Abbot.—I suppose not. It is understood to be recessed; probably in consequence of that gradual gain of the sea upon the land, which, of late days, grew so imminent a danger. How many fortresses preceded the present, it is scarcely possible to say. I myself have seen the debris of an older structure, of brick, which we know did not constitute the material of the original fort which Moultrie defended. It is probable that, when the successful defence was made in 1775, the fort rose greatly in public opinion, and money was expended upon it. It was finished, and possibly enlarged in plan, and improved in other respects. When, in 1780, the Island fell into the possession of the British, it is not unlikely that they attached sufficient importance to it, to add still farther to the strength of the works. These opinions must rest wholly upon conjecture. No details have been preserved. As a place of summer resort, I have my doubts whether the British made much use of it, while they were in possession of the State. It may have been used as a sort of Lazaretto or Hospital, or Quarantine refuge, as was Haddrell's— perhaps, like Haddrell's, as a deposit for prisoners;—but being in possession of a good Cavalry, their favorite places of evening resort, ride, and recreation, were “Up the Road”—the “Quarter E House,” below Izard's camp, being the usual terminus of their wanderings. It was rather unsafe to venture beyond this point, and even here, towards the conclusion of the war, they were frequently picked up by the Partizans. Editor.—Have you ever been within the present structure, Father? Abbot.—A thousand times, my son, while under different commands. Recently, I had much pleasure in mounting the ramparts, and looking abroad upon the glorious prospect. Editor.—The place is admirably kept, Father. Abbot.—It is; the Garrison orderly, civil, and wearing those looks of brightness and intelligence, which show great subordination, without despotism. This is highly creditable to their officers, none of whom have I the pleasure to know. Editor—You should know, them, Father.— They are all fine gentlemen—intelligent and graceful; soldiers who have served honorably in Mexico, and wear their laurels modestly at home. Abbot.—The school is a good one, my son, for social as well as soldier-training. A military man, where the service is an honorable one, must always be a gentleman. The prestige of the service compels it, and society recognizes him. Where the great body of a people are fighting men—valor being the common property, and cowardice the melancholy exception—high refinement, the result of intelligence and polish, must inevitably belong to the officer, since, otherwise, there would be nothing to elevate or distinguish him above his men. He who does not feel this and act upon it, becomes rapidly degraded, and passes out of sight, if not out of the service. The day is gone by, when a rough and surly monster—a drinking, swearing, strutting animal, who had nothing but brute courage and his epaulettes to mark him as a soldier—could pass muster in society. We undoubtedly owe a great deal to the Military School at West Point. I am free to say that the South should have such an institution also. I would plant it somewhere, looking down at once on the Gulf and Atlantic, among the mountain ranges of North Carolina or Tennessee. Beauclerk.—I can conceive of no greater injustice, Father, than that which, in our popular histories, gives so much credit to Charles Lee, for his share in the action of Fort Moultrie. Abbot.—There could be no greater. Lee's share in the defence was really none at all; or what there was, was discreditable to his judgment, if not his manhood. The credit is due to John Rutledge, William Moultrie, and his brave companions—the sons of the soil all of them—who took their stations at the guns with but one feeling—the conviction that they had to fight. Lee was not willing to fight, steadily opposed the defence, and, being an Englishman, with the most perfect faith in a British fleet, swore bloody oaths, that the fortress was a mere slaughter pen, which the British broadsides would `knock about the heads of the garrison in half an hour. He would have abandoned it had the Governor permitted. Rutledge swore, that before he would write such an order, his right hand should be stricken from his body. E2 Moultrie's temper, on the occasion, was not a whit more yielding: “If they knock the Fort about our ears, we can still fight them behind the ruins,” was his language. Subsequently he said: “I never imagined that the enemy could force the post. I always considered myself able to defend it.” Editor.—And he did! Abbot.—Admirably; it was one of the greatest actions of the war, and preceded the Declaration of Independence, which was made six days afterwards. We do not know the fact, but where was the impossibility of having the news of this event expressed in five or six days to Philadelphia? If the fact was known by Congress, it doubtless contributed to the firmness of that body on that memorable anniversary. We know that the express, bringing the news of the battle of Lexington, took a much longer time in compassing the same distance; but, at that period, no previous arrangements had been made for expressing intelligence. Routes had not been opened, nor emisaries employed before hand; and these were the most substantial difficulties in such a performance. But we have no reason to suppose that, with the whole seaboard anxious in regard to events in daily progress, the public authorities would have neglected the necessary organization of expresses. Besides, it was known that a powerful British fleet had left New-York, as it was supposed, for South-Carolina or Georgia. How natural that the American Congress should employ all its agencies to ascertain its destination and the result. I repeat, it is not impossible that something of the battle of Fort Moultrie was known in Philadelphia on the 4th July ensuing; and the effect must have been sensibly felt. It was, in truth, a most bloody battle. It has been shown that, for the number of troops which they had engaged, the British loss was greater, by far, than it was in the terrible victory at Trafalgar. Editor.—Yet how the account of this affair is slurred over in our Northern histories. Abbot.—How every thing Southern is slurred over in Northern histories. We hear, for example, in never ending declamations, of the Tea which was emptied into the harbor of Boston. It is scarcely known, even to our own people, that the same thing was done in the harbor of Charleston. New England claims to have done every thing, first to last, in the Revolution! yet she did very little. Her writers may well begrudge us the great battles fought within our borders. Recently, a most impudent attempt has been made to show that these battles were fought by New England troops; but the absurdity of the claim defeats itself; and, fortunately, they have not been able to destroy the records. It is curious that, even before the Revolution, this tendency of New England to usurpation (a characteristic always of the Puritans) was emphatically dwelt upon by persons in Carolina, to discourage the progress to union of the several colonies against the mother country. They distinctly predicted the pretensions of our Yankee brethren. Josiah Quincy, who was sent from Boston to Charleston, as an emisary to foment the E3 occasion for quarrel, states that one of a dinner party, at the residence of Miles Brewton, urged that “the Massachusetts were aiming at sovereignty over the other provinces; that they now took the lead; were assuming dictatorial authority, &amp;c.” To this Mr. Josiah Quincy put in a modest disclaimer, as a matter of course. The other replied, however: “You may depend upon it, if the Colonies shake themselves free of Britain, you will have your Governor from Boston. When it comes to the test, Boston will give the other provinces the shell and the shadow, and keep the substance. Take away the power and superintendence of Britain, and the Colonies must submit to the next power.” If New England did not succeed in this desire, or design, it was not because of the infirmity of her ambition. She got the better part of the Major Generals and Brigadiers at the beginning of the war, and cursed the military of the country with a most incompetent crew of Captains, Deacons, and others fit only to be Deacons. How much of the prediction might have been verified, subsequently, had not New-York been more favorably situated, not simply for commerce, but for connection with the South? Let the South once set up for herself, and where will be New-York? Editor.—I heard it stated some time ago, Father, that, when the battle was actually in progress at Fort Moultrie, the Priest at St. Michael's prayed for the success of the assailants, to the wives and daughters of the garrison; who left the Church in a body, accordingly. Abbot.—The story, I suppose, is true. I have not only heard it repeatedly, from old persons, but I have seen it somewhere in print. I don't know but what you may find it in Dalcho, together with the name of the officiating minister. It must not be forgotten, however, that the Church was a State establishment, under the control of the Church of England, and most of the Divines of that period were sent to us from abroad. These matters deserve the attention of our antiqueries. I wish we could persuade some of them into giving us a series of walks about Charleston. I do not know any city in the Union, which might be found more abundantly rich in antiquities. How many trials by storm and fire hath she undergone—by siege and battle! how many adventurous enterprises hath she undertaken! Her people were always military. She carried her arms to the banks of the Mississippi, and fought the French in their own colonies. Her troops traversed the waters of the St. John's, and the Mauvilla, (Mobile) and her harbor has been penetrated by French, Spanish, and piratical assailants. Thrice has she been besieged, and in no instance hath she been dishonored, even when overthrown. Editor.—The chronicle is a beautiful and extensive one, which records the patriotism of our women of Charleston. There is one item, however, Father, which comes from good authority— that of one of the oldest inhabitants—which has never been in print. When Charleston was in possession of the British, the women of the place would frequently procure passes to go to their E4 farms or plantations in the country. They seized these occasions for carrying forth supplies of cloth, linen, and even gunpowder and shot, to their countrymen in the Brigade of Marion. These commodities were concealed beneath their garments; and, in preparation for their departure, the dimensions of the good women were observed sensibly to increase. At length it was noticed by the officers on guard, that the lady, who, when she left the city, was of enormous bulk—of absolute dropsical physique—would return reduced to a shadow. Strange suspicions naturally ran in their heads as to the causes of a change so surprising; and these suspicions were not always creditable to the fair fame of the lady. But other notions, less unfavorable to her virtue, began to prevail, and at the expense of her safety; and it was arranged accordingly to subject the emigrating parties, hereafter, to a test, which should infallibly exhibit the nature of a disease which had such curious results. Accordingly a jury of spinsters was provided, and the fat ladies were taken into custody. The discovery was awful in the last degree—bales of blue broadcloth were unrolled from about the slenderists waists; and swan and duck shot, and gunpowder and ball, rolls of duck and cotton flannels, and Heaven knows what besides, appeared from beneath the ample petticoats, attesting the patriotism of the sex. This put a stop to their growth, as well as their peregrinations. Abbot.—No doubt a world of anecdote is yet forthcoming, My venerable friend, Dr. Johnson, has a great variety of stores of this sort, which should make their way to the public. A Stranger's Guide Book through the city—and this might include the Parishes—which, at that period were in singular and close connection with the city—would be as full of interest as a popular novel. The habits, manners, customs, sports, trials, troubles, adventures, anecdotes of life in peculiar forms, and society under the most various circumstances, are still to be gathered and described, in regard to Charleston, if the subject is seized upon now, and before the present generation passes. Another race will know nothing of these things. Editor.—Such a book would need be published by subscription, otherwise it would scarcely pay. Abbot.—True, we are exceedingly patriotic, but don't like to pay for it. True patriotism would say, that such a volume—every volume, indeed, which illustrates the deeds and virtues of our people—should be a family book. It should be in every library; and yet — but the subject is an ungracious one. Editor.—Will it ever be any better? Abbot.—Yes, when our individuality stops short of mere egötism, and, in the development of a peculiar nature, is yet modest enough to remember all its debt of gratitude—equally to the past and the present. Hearken, my son. We have been discoursing of Moultrie and his public services. His is one of those names by which we swear. He constitutes a portion of that sectional capital of character, of which we may boast to our neighbors, and to foreign nations. He is ours, E5 and, therefore, we boast. Now, listen. It is now fully a year, since I read in the columns of the Charleston Mercury, a communication, from an anonymous source, which pointed out to our public the fact, that this same Moultrie was reported, annually to the Legislature, as a bankrupt debtor to the State, to the amount of some five hundred dollars! The writer of the article proffered to join with others in a subscription to efface this offensive and ungracious record from the books!— In vain! I am glad the suggestion was not adopted. It is an act which the Legislature itself should perform, for its own credit, and to save the State from shame. As it is, the only monument to Moultrie's memory, which we keep in repair, is one to his reproach and shame! Moultrie was poor, and died so. His virtues and honesty have never been impeached. Let our people boast no more of the memory of this man, until the State shall have written against his name, in the language of Loredano, “L'ha pagata!” He has more than paid her. Something will be always due to him, which the future can only acknowledge! Beauclerk.—Our Poet and Painter seem asleep, Father. Abbot.—Not they! I never rouse them when they dream. I know that we shall get the benefit of all their dreaming hereafter. Editor.—See, they bestir themselves. Abbot.—We will join them. Ho! Son of Apollo, arouse you! We are in our moment of exstase, and you have doubtless passed through yours.— Give us the fruits of your inspirations. I see that the Muse has been with you. You would else have never been so quiet. Come, my son, the Poem. Let us taste the quality of your fruits. Beauclerk.—A sentence! a sentence! Poet.—But, Father! extemporaneous verse, as you well know — Abbot.—Is no verse at all, you would say. No matter. We are indulgent. “Leave off your damnable faces and begin.” Is this a time for affectations? Speak, sir, the Poem! It is a decree of the Brotherhood. Poet.—I obey. (Recites.) Soft is the veil of moonlight o'er the waters, Softly the swell, upon the shore, of billows, Soft in the distance, the great city's spires, And soft the breeze. Peace is upon the land and on the ocean, Peaceful the slumbers of this ocean hamlet, And the blue concave, by a cloud unshadow'd, Speaks still for peace! Before us sleeps a mound, whose solemn shadow, Beseems the red man's tumulus of ages, As keeping in its deep and vaulted chambers, A realm of dead. With gentle light, the moon stoops down to hallow, The deep repose that wakes not to sweet voices. She leaves her smiles, where sad, in seasons' vanish'd, Man left but tears. No sleepless bird disturbs, with cry or music, Unsuited to the quiet, deep and sacred, Where silence, in her own primeval temple, Still rules supreme. Who that beholds that ocean wrapt in brightness, Who, that enjoys embrace with these soft zephyrs, That feels the beauty and the calm about him— Would dream of strife? Would dream of tempests raging o'er this ocean, Clouds in that azure vault, its charm effacing, And for this breeze, so meek, yet full of fondness, Would look for storm! Yet will the tempest, with a wild transition, Stifle these gentle breathings of the zephr, While great toruados sweep the face of Heaven, With all its charms! Yet will the seas, in beauty now reposing, Boil up in madness, and o'erthrow their barriers, Defacing lawny shore and verdant meadow, Now blest with peace. Thus, in a moment, let the foe but threaten, That silent mound becomes a fiery fortress, Whose flashing death-bolts, hurtling o'er the waters, Ring out his doom! Such awful change, of old, this shore hath witness'd, When first our young Republic, bold but feeble, Claim'd, though at peril of all wreck of fortune, Her place of pride. Thus calm the seas, when o'er the waters raging, Rush'd, swollen with wrath, the giant form of Britain, Her thunders hurling on our peaceful hamlets, With hate of hell! Thus silent lay our bulwarks of Palmetto, Behind them, little groups of youthful heroes, Waiting the signal, when, with answering thunders, To meet her wrath. How patient was their watch beneath that banner, The slight blue streamer, lighted by one crescent, That show'd the modest hope that warm'd their courage, In that dark hour. How doubtful, yet how fearless of the struggle, When, in the strength assured, of thousand battles, Britain, in armour, 'gainst the youthful shepherd, Came fiercely on! Doubtful our young men stood, but undespairing, Not blind to all the fearful odds against them, But sworn, in faith, that finds it better falling In fight, than fear! How beautiful—as serpents fang'd with venom, Glided the swans of battle to the conflict, Their streamers flaunting with Britannia's Lion, Rampant in red! How silently they moor'd beneath our fortress, Unmuzzled their grim ministers of vengeance, And waited but the signal, to send terror Among our sons. One awful pause preceded the wild tempest, Then roar'd the storm, and fell the hail of battle, A thousand fires were lighted, in a moment, At Moloch's shrine! One look of yearning to the distant city, Where hung in tears and fondness, wives and mothers, Forms of most fond delight, and dear devotion, Weeping in prayer! And then, the brave hearts of our youthful warriors, Nerved with new courage by those sweet spectators, Conscious what hopes and eyes were set upon them, Rush'd to the strife. Thunder for thunder, and defiant voices, Bore witness to the love that faced that conflict— How the brave spirits, battling for their homesteads, Defied the Fates! Through the long day of summer, still unshaken, They stood beside their cannon, while each broadside, Shook their frail rugged bastions of Palmetto, But shook no hearts. There Moultrie coolly stands, the scene surveying, Ranging his muzzles on each mighty frigate, Speeding each fearful missile on its mission Of blood and wreck! There Marion ministers, his young Lieutenant, Wheels the swift piece, and sights the flaming cannon— Or, when the bullet rends the reeling vessel, Shouts loud with cheer! There, stout McDonald, slain upon the rampart, The first brave martyr in the fearful battle, Shrieks, as he falls: “I die, my gallant comrades, But not our cause!” Down sinks the crescent streamer of the fortress, While o'er the city sudden darkness lower'd, As if a star, the only one in Heaven, Had sunk in night. But, lo! it rises from the cloud, and waving, Reveals the lithe and active form of Jasper— He plucks it from the beach, and rears it proudly Through all the storm! If then one heart had trembled in its terror, It gathers hope and pride from that glad omen, And hears the whisper'd cry from each fond mother, “Be strong, my son!” And they were strong, as for the rock, the eagle, Who hears the cry of young ones in his eyrie, Assail'd by subtlest foes; and bends his pinion To guard his nest. Day wanes, and night hangs out her starry banner, Blue spread the curtains of the sky for slumber, Peace soars aloft, as if in pray'r imploring, For peace below! But still the cannon thundered with its mission, Still spoke fierce music to the hearts of valor, Still shouted high the brave, and shriek'd the dying, 'Till midnight fell! The Lion-banner sunk, at length, in darkness; The crescent soar'd, in every eye triumphant; While in the distant city rose the shoutings From hearts made glad. With dawn, the shatter'd hulks to sea were drifting; Upon the shores the gentle waves were breaking; And, with the triumph of our virgin valor, Came peace once more!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">VIII. Editor.—(rapping at the Abbot's window)— Father, you bade me call you at daylight. It is now dawning, and the tide is pouring in magnificently. Abbot.—Son, I will be with you in an instant. I have but to slip into my drawers, since I understand that bathing here is conducted selon les regles. Editor.—I fancy you need not be so scrupulous. It is so early that objects are scarcely visible at any distance. You see but the vast spread of the waters; and the breakwater, though contrasted with them, seems but a remote and indefinite line upon the horizon. Beauclerk has presumed upon the doubtful light, and is in that primitive condition which suggested to Eve the uses of the fig leaf. Abbot.—The irreverent dog! But I will not follow his example. I am ready: and now, my son, remember that you have more than Cæsar's fortunes to take care of. I have been modestly reluctant, all my life, to venture out of my depth. Should you see me floundering confusedly, kicking away with amazing rapidity, and yawing about like a vessel in the hands of a tipsy helmsman, remember to come to the rescue. I fancy I am one of the few Charleston boys that cannot swim. I tried it when a boy, but could never work the vessel and keep her afloat at the same time. My head had always a leaden-like proclivity downwards, and I could never learn. I believe that some men are denied the faculty altogether. You are aware that this is the case with some horses, who will rather lie down in the water, or wade along upon the bottom, than make the attempt. No practice, no frequency of experiment, ever changes the result. The vulgar superstition in the country is, that all May colts have this disposition to lie down in the water, though it is not said that all May colts refuse to swim. I was once nearly drowned crossing an arm of Pearl River, in Mississippi, by the mulish tendency of my steed in this matter. The stream though a frequent ford, was swollen beyond its bounds. The atrocious beast went down and down, the waters rising higher and higher at each moment. They were soon at the saddle skirts; soon over my own skirts; and, finally, I was nearly lifted off by the current. I had only to stick to the animal, to thrust my legs down, and cling to his sides, taking it coolly (as you may suppose,) while I saw the beast's head fairly go under. It was but a moment, however, and in the next he scrambled up a bank. Powerful and precious was the long breath which we both drew in the same instant, though from different emotions. Editor—A narrow escape, Father. But here you are in no danger. The water deepens gradually, and at no ordinary tide is it above the head within the breakwater. But I am with you, and all the rest of us swim like ducks. Abbot.—Or tadpoles! Beauclerk, I see, is already in. What a floundering and plunging he keeps. I can see his white form as he leaps and wantons in the glorious element. What a delightful faculty. What pride to realize the painted picture of Shakspeare: “To beat the surges under you, To ride upon their backs; to tread the water, And fling aside its enmity; still breasting The surge most swollen, that meets you—your bold head 'Bove the contentious waves still kept, and oaring Yourself, with your good arms in lusty stroke!” This is, indeed, a power and a grace to be desired—to F be toiled after; and I envy few accomplishments to my neighbors so much as that of being an adroit and skilful swimmer. Editor.—It seems strange, Father, that, with such feelings, you never acquired the art. Abbot.—Perhaps it is not so strange. My education in all things was greatly neglected in my childhood. I need not say that most physical acquisitions, to be well made, must be made in early youth. Riding, for example, running, boxing, and even shooting. Now, it so happens, that I was a sickly child. My infancy was marvellously feeble. I was half the time in the hands of the doctor, drugged and dieted. I lived in spite of him, but my opportunities were lost; for years I remained feeble, and timid accordingly. I shared not in their exercises with the athletes of the school; and books, from my close confinement, soon superseded field and water sports, and studies; and now, it is too late to learn, my son. I now see that swimming should form a part of one's education, as becoming as dancing, and far more necessary. What a place here for a swimming school. I trust that our new Hotel will keep this matter in mind, and keep a competent person always, and convenient places assigned, in which “to teach the youthful athlete how to swim.” The practice is common in England. The art is taught like boxing. Editor.—A good suggestion. Franklin's counsels may be well enough; but physical accomplishments are not to be learned from essays or books. Practice is the only school; and the first experiments in swimming ought always to carry the urchin beyond his depth: always taking care that succor is at hand. This throws him upon his resources, and brings out all his energies. It is thus that he acquires confidence and courage. Now, these are the first essentials, and these acquired, all the rest is easy. A good swimmer is the most audacious being in the world when in the element he loves. The billows seem to be as conscious when they have to deal with one who fears them, as the horse, when crossed by a timid rider. Horse and water equally take advantage of such persons. They must equally be taught to feel, that he who rides, is their master, and is determined to remain so. Let him learn to slap saucily the billow on the chops, and clap fearless spurs to the steed, and the empire is his own. Abbot.—A truth! The moral of the steed is in the spur of the rider! I have heard with some surprise that large numbers of sailors are ignorant of the art of swimming. It is said that some of them have refused to acquire it, and have given as a reason that swimming is of no service at sea, but a real misfortune; that it frequently prompts the courage to experiments of extreme recklessness; that in the event of danger, the good swimmer is usually despatched on the perilous performance— made to swim on shore with a rope, for example— and if he falls overboard, at sea, the possession of the faculty would only prolong his tortures and his dangers. He prefers to sink outright rather than protract a struggle, which will most probably be useless—since few are saved who fall overboard at sea—and be exposed to the agony of a piecemeal F2 death in the jaws of the ravening shark. There would seem to be some reasoning in the argument, though it is difficult to persuade ourselves that the acquisition of any power, by which we increase our manhood, should be at any time an evil. Editor.—The sailor who argues thus, argues rather to excuse his deficiencies, I fancy, than to prove their advantages. He probably belongs to that class who swim stone-fashion, as you described yourself to do. He has found the acquisition difficult or impossible. Abbot.—But why take to the sea? Editor.—From necessity—the world's ill usage, vice, fugitive moods, and a thousand other occasional impulses. I suspect that most of those who go to sea, from erratic desires, are good swimmers. Boating and swimming are likely to have prompted their choice of vocation. Are you fairly in, Father? Abbot.—Up to the middle. Editor.—Good! Let us wade some ten yards further now, throw your hands thus, above your head, and bury yourself in the waters. Abbot.—It is done! Editor.—That first shock reconciles you to a bath of twenty minutes: only keep moving. It may be well to make an effort, old as you are, to float and swim. Use equal movements of arms and feet, at the same time, occupying as much surface as you can. Abbot.—That is, spreading myself out? Editor.—That will keep you afloat; and to do this will not be difficult, if you will only be cool— be not impatient—be not flurried. Be deliberate; and this ought to be easy, when you remember that you are within your depth, and may, at any moment, lift your head above the waters. Timid persons find their difficulty in this. They do not give themselves time, get flurried, and having swallowed a pint of sea-water, lose all stomach for the experiment. There! that will do! I see you understand me. Abbot—I certainly contrive to float. How delicious is the temperature! How refreshing! The morning, just after sleep, is always the best time for the bath, from head to foot. The system is relaxed from sleep. The nerves need the restoration of tone. The whole body demands the refreshing influences of water, precisely as the face and hands. But for the languor induced by our habits, quite as much as our climate, such would be the common practice. Editor.—Look at Beauclerk, Father. Abbot.—How the dog rollicks! What antics does he play with the billows! He frolics like a young colt, just escaped from the stables to the common. What's he after now? Whither does he go? Editor.—Towards the stone wall. He is after a dive, I fancy. Yes, there he clambers up. Our Poet is there before him. Do you see their forms together on the breakwater? They mean to dive together. Both swim well, and I suppose they design a match for the shore. You see them? Abbot.—Yes, by Saint Jupiter, and both naked as innocence. They are off. The plunge was a F3 fine one; but, between us, Mr. Editor, there is a little too much light, methinks, for such bold experiments. The day thickens. Those bright grey streaks, “the sudden arrows from the eastern bow,” give us warning to depart. Editor.—Not so, Father! Our Islanders are reluctant risers. They will keep their pillows for an hour yet. Abbot.—I hope so: for, in truth, though no swimmer, I find the bath a rare luxury. What a generous glow! The sea is a buoyant couch. It sustains me, though not its master. How sadly sweet is the mysterious chiding of the waves against that barrier of stone; and how softly, with what velvet steps, did the tide creep in this morning. I rose and looked forth some time before you knocked at the window. In the dim light of stars, I could discern the breakwater, and the flashing billows beyond it. But within the basin there was no sign of water. All was dull grey sands, and that seemed only an hour ago. How noiselessly it stole upward to the very porches of the dwelling. What a wondrous and beautiful mystery in the decree that moves these glorious elements, in an order so matchless and unerring, and all, as it would seem, in a service tributary to the tastes and the fancies, no less than the common wants of man! See you, in the east, where a little drift of white clouds, a sort of rippled muslin, puts on a delicate carnation tinge. The day is making progress. The sun will not be slow to follow. We must hurry our bath. Editor.—Not yet, Father; not yet! How I wish that you could swim. I must take my plunge from the breakwater also. I am half tempted to do it on the outside. There can surely be no sharks at this early hour. There is no proof that the sharks rise with the fowls. Abbot.—If fowls were their common diet, I should presume that there could be no question of their habits; but unless you can show that the fish, which are their food, retire with the sun, and keep perdu until he re-appears again, it is mere madness to risk anything upon the habits of the sea-wolf. No! no! my son, veto! I forego none of the functions of the Father Abbot, even though “half seas over;” and I positively forbid you trying any foolish experiment. Editor.—I submit, Father. Yet you little dream of the delights of breasting the more vigorous billows. It is then that the swimmer feels himself, and exults in his possessions. You remember the line of Pollock, describing Byron's passion for the sea. They seem, to me, among the noblest and smothest of our heroic blank: “He laid his hand upon old ocean's mane, And play'd familiar with his hoary locks.” Abbot.—They are fine, but borrowed from Byron himself, who borrowed, in turn, from the Bible: “Once more upon the waters—yet once more, And the waves bound beneath me, as a steed, That knows his rider.” F4 Pollock, I am half disposed to think, has improved upon the original. But, turn your eyes from the sea, my son. Look back upon our ocean hamlet, as our poet properly calls it. How sweetly does it sleep in the cold light of the dawn. The outline of the settlement seen in the imperfect light, actually looms up nobly and picturesquely. The rudeness of the exterior is not perceptible; and one might fancy that a proper architecture had been at work to address the most elaborate appeals to the eye. But, hark! What is that? It sounds like a regular war whoop! Editor.—It is, and it is from the throat of Pictor. He learned the war whoop among the Choctaws. Abbot.—But why does he gives it to us now. It is surely a signal. It must mean something. Where is he? Editor.—Down, close under the shadow of the breakwater. Abbot.—I see! and hark, again! Look! he waves his hand toward the shore. What can he mean? Editor.—By Jove, Father, we are not alone. There is another party within the basin. They do not see us. Should they be ladies now. Abbot.—I see! Three tall forms, muffled up like the witches in Macbeth. They wave their hands also. “Thrice to thine!” Editor.—“And thrice to mine!” Abbot.—“And thrice again to make up nine.” Can they be women? Or only of that breed, Desinit in piscem, mulier formosa superne?” Should they be women, that fellow Beauclerk is in a pretty fix. Editor.—They may be mermaids, in sooth. They are too tall for women. Abbot.----They only seem tall in this light, and standing up, as they do, in shallow water. They are women, I am certain!—and there go Beauclerk and the Poet, in full plunge, toward them. In their trial of skill and speed, they see nothing but one another. See what tremendous splurges that fellow, Beauclerk, makes. Little does he dream who sees his antics. How wantonly he darts, and skims, and wallows—half the time out of water:—and, now, only look at the blind, the utterly besotted, mortals. They have actually begun to splash away, like overgrown urchins, at each other's faces, making every thing foam about them. Editor.—Beauclerk is beaten, and the Poet pursues him. Abbot.—And there they rush, by all that's gracious, directly among the strangers. We shall soon see whether they are women or not. Ha! We have it! what a shriek! Push for the shore, my son. Keep within the shadow of the break-water, and let us make away toward the Point House. We may yet escape unseen. Pictor is ahead of us, moving in the same direction. See, how the strangers scamper. They tumble headlong, one over the other, toward the beach; while our naked athletes push, equally headlong, in the opposite quarter. Editor.—The Poet has his drawers on, Father. F5 Abbot.—A fig for his drawers! He might as well be as naked as a Pict. His drawers stick to him like a pitch plaister, shewing the beauties of his form in all its absolute perfection. Ho! there, you runagates! What a mischief have you done! Beauclerk.—All your fault, Father. Abbot.—My fault, monster! Beauclerk.—Yes, Father, the ambition to show off before you, led us into this misfortune. Abbot.—Hence, infidel! To the house with all despatch, and into your breeches. We shall steal away, and take our breakfast at the East end of the island. There is a friend who keeps good cheer in that quarter, who will gladly welcome us. The storm will blow ever in our absence. In flight alone is safety. `Sauve qui pent,' is the cry. Editor.—We breakfast then with —? Abbot.—Yes! And see his farm and dairy. His cows, his calves, his pigs, his poultry, his ox, his ass, and every thing that is his. He affords a happy instance of a man, brought up to business cares in a city, who has a taste for nature, and whose humanity has never been corrupted by a selfish occupation. Beauclerk.—Do we ride, Father? Abbot.—Get yourself into your garments! Ask no questions! Join us on the back-beach. We walk! It will help digestion. A long walk after the bath, and a good breakfast after that, and a wise man is a happy one for the day. He is then more apt to realize that condition of sound mind in sound body—means sana in corpore sano—which is the very perfection of humanity—in its capacity for enjoyment, at least. Editor.—Beauclerk, you should never have gone in without your drawers and shirt. Abbot.—A grave truth, just one hour too late. But we must enforce and make the caution a permanent one in his mind by a proper penalty. Let the decree be registered against him;—a basket of champagne. Beauclerk.—A hard case, Father. But is it understood that we invite our mermaids to sup with us? Abbot.—Out Polyphemus, out! before I couch thy sight for thee with a staff as potent as that of Ulysses. Away, Centaur, and get thyself clad. Editor.—This is a mischance, Father. [ Abbot.—Yes, if it chance that there shall have been a miss among these strangers; but between us, son, you may make your mind easy. These are no women, but our own brethren, Beaurevoir, Bienami, and Beauregard, who came down in a sail boat late last night, and came to my chamber as I was about to retire. I wished to give Beauclerk a scare, in order to curb his tendency to excess. The thing was arranged with our brethren who will join us, on the way to breakfast. Editor.—I breathe, Father. I am relieved. Had they been women! Abbot.—Pshaw!—had they been ladies, the affair would have been a little annoying, but nothing more. To the pure, all things are pure, and keeping in mind the phrase of the King in regard to the Countess—of whom, by the way, nothing need be said—we must, in all such cases, find our security in the motto,----“Honi soit qui mal y pense.” But let us away, and leave the boys to follow.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">IX. Abbot.—There comes the sun! He is just struggling above the waters. How like a struggle it appears! The effect, at this moment, conducts irresistibly to this impression. The waves seem to rise about him, laboring to keep him down.— They have lashed themselves into foam in the endeavor, and though they fail in their object, yet it would seem that his victory has not been won without loss. His wounds seem to have dyed the torrents with his blood. The crimson and the white foam mingle together; and we fancy that were we near enough to hear, we should be stunned by the howls of disappointment on the one hand, and the shouts of victory on the other. We hear the murmur of billows even here; and it seems to be allied to the conflict, and to have been occasioned by it. The coulds have shared somewhat in the affair. They wear the hues of blood also. One great and reptured mass hangs directly above the head of the conqueror. It is the smoke reeking up from the field of fight, rising above, and forming its appropriate canopy. The sun employs it as a trophy. It becomes his banner; and its torn and tattered edges are spread out, and rise with him, as if borne aloft by the tallest of his angel legions—some Azazel of the imperial host! Other banners now appear along the horizon, as if rising with him from the deep; forming a grand procession to accompany his onward march. And see, those pale white groups of cloud, flitting fast away, right and left, as remotely as possible from his line of march—a wild and capricious disarray. May we not suppose them to be the scattered camps of some auxiliary host, flying confusedly to escape destruction or captivity. The whole broad expanse of heaven exhibits as many contrasts and varieties of shape and shadow, in the advance of the morning splendor, as any field of various conflict, or any country under the march of a dreaded conqueror. It would seem as if the hosts of night and ocean, assembled under the cover of darkness for the conquest of the earth, had been dispersed by a single glance from some glorious messenger of heaven. Editor.—You make quite a picture, Father. Abbot.—It makes itself. This is one of those spectacles that convert all men, more or less, into painters. The mind catches from the prospect, a thousand suggestions for the fancy, and the eye looks forth for pictures. But the sunrise is not simply a spectacle. It is a moral emblem. We see the great invisible work of creation performed anew with the return of every day. We see the results of the Almighty working, as at the dawn of all mortal being, though the process is wholly hidden from our eyes. We see in the glorious spectacle the moral that is designed to excite our emulation. The day of man is a march in light. It is a constant progress forward. It rises in night, to have its setting in other regions, which it is to enliven and illumine also. We pass on from world to world; with an active duty assigned to us in each. He only is the true Christian, who goes on working and marching to the close. In this way only can he unfold his possessions, and bless other eyes with that trust of light, which is conferred upon him for this very purpose.— Happy he who obeys the law of his nature as implicitly as the sun! Who rises regularly to his duties, and, heedless of storm, and strife, and temporary obscuration by cloud, vapor, and interposing and envious bodies, still keeps in his old path, “the ordered course pursuing.” Editor.—Is not that last member a quotation, Father? I think I have heard the phrase before. Abbot.---Doubtlessly. It is a quotation from a version which I made twenty years ago of Goethe's famous Hymn of the Archangels, at the opening of the Faust. It suits the scene, and you shall have it all. HYMN OF THE ARCHANGELS. RAPHAEL. And still the sun as ever, Chimes with his brother spheres, His order'd path pursuing, With the thunder's solemn roll— Though him we may not fathom, He yet gives strength to us— Glorious, oh! mighty Father, Thy works, as at the first! GABRIEL. And with a mighty fleetness, The pomp of earth revolves; The glorious blaze of Heaven, Now chang'd for fearful night; The broad waves of the ocean Foam up against the rocks, While whirling on, both rock and sea Chime with the ever rolling spheres. MICHAEL. And roaring as in rivalry, From sea to land, from land to sea, The storms erect around a chain Of deepest elemental rage; And flashing desolation there Glares in the thunder's rushing path— But, Lord! thy messengers revere The milder goings of thy day. THE THREE. Though Thee we may not fathom, Thy look gives strength to us— Glorious, oh! mighty Father, Thy works, as at the first! Editor.—I wished you had rhymed it, Father. Abbot.—So do I. I shall rhyme it some day when I am in the mood, and have the leisure; but there are some subjects for verse which rhyme does not seem to improve. Sacred poetry, for example, always appears to me to lose something of dignity and solemnity, by the petty tagging of the rhyme. To pursue our moral analogies: it matters not to man, keeping his natural symbols in his sight, that his light may sometimes, nay, frequently, fail to be seen, by those for whom it is designed, and who are supposed to look for it. Enough that he can reply with the magician in the mysterious cave of the Visigoth: “I do mine office!” It is quite sufficient that he wilfully withholds no portion of his precious beams. It is the misfortune and the error of those who wilfully refuse to see. Editor.—Yet unless they see, Father, where is his recompense; where their acknowledgments? Abbot.—His ample recompense lies in his own exercise, if his ambition be the right one: looking to the only proper source of reward. Shall man look ever and only to his brother; and what shall be the virtue in his charity, if he is perpetually groaning for the quid pro quo? Genius is the world's great benefactor. Shall it cease to be genius because the world is ungrateful; and shall the benefactor look to the pauper for his pay. What is it to the noble----which is always the giving and the performing mind----that his petty puling race, each cursing himself and his neighbor with his miserable little two-and-sixpence vanities, his small conceit of place and position, and the strut which is always laboring, not to be high, but to seem high----stubbornly refuses to acknowledge the benefits of the benefactor----in the powerful phrase of Milton, “crams and blasphemes the feeder,” and decries the claim, which it feels that it can never satisfy? Nay, what were the real value of the tribute of acknowledgment, were the world to make free and full confession of the benefits received? Would that be sufficiently compensative for the performance, which still strives, and serves, and saves? It is not intended that it should be! The essence of compensation to man, for good and great works upon earth, is to be found in the performance itself. This is the principle of vitality in the moral system. It is in the feeling that he does, is doing, and has done, that the worker finds his reward, in all moral and intellectual labors. This, indeed, constitutes the secret of his dignity. He is the master of a world-wide charity. The sense of a gratified obedience, in the heart of man, is the source, not only of the mens conscia recti, but of the higher rewards of a justifiable ambition. Milton alludes to this, when he says in Lycidas: “`But not the praise,' Phœbus replied, and touch'd my trembling ear; `Fame is no plant that grows in mortal soil.”' No! we fulfil a destiny, my son. The duty must be performed; and it is not to man that we are to look ever, for the reward of the worker. The sense of duty done, and grief endured, without complaint and in a cheerful, sanguine spirit, naturally directs the eye of the laborer to the great Giver of all endowments, and assures him of ultimate acknowledgment, in the shape of continued and higher employment hereafter. In other words, though the Prophet toils for man, he toils in the employ of God. To which ought he to look for reward? Editor.—What new and hopeful prospects does such a view open to those who seem to toil in vain. G How it unfolds the vista of hope to labor and art. Abbot.—Necessarily! Man belongs to a system, even as the sun, the moon and stars. With greater discretion allowed him, he is subject to laws which are quite as exacting in degree. His simple duty is obedience. In obedience lies the whole secret of his usefulness; and usefulness, understood in its enlarged and proper sense, covers the entire tract of Christian obligation. Editor.—Is there not some danger, Father, from such a doctrine? Does it not tend greatly to narrow the province of humanity? What will become of our friends, Poet and Painter, if we establish the utilitarian principle on such an eminence? Abbot.—You do not give due value to the words I use. I am not arguing for the vulgar doctrine of utilitarianism. I said usefulness, in its enlarged and proper sense, in which the Poet, in all probability, occupies the highest position as a social benefactor. He is the father of the profoundest philosophy. He speaks for our noblest nature. His very language belongs to a condition which humanity may understand and feel, but cannot ordinarily use. As one of the tribe has described it—“is the large utterance of the early gods!” It is a divine speech, worthy of prophecy and inspiration—in which true inspiration has usually—nay always—spoken. Editor.—But all the studies and labors of the great body of mankind, will fail to endow them with this utterance—Poeta nascitur non fit! What then becomes of its usefulness? Abbot.—It lies partly in this very particular. It is at once desirable and unattainable. It is not intended that the world at large should speak this language. It is enough if the world is content to hear and take it to their hearts. If men were all poets and prophets there would be no men. Humanity would be advanced, at a bound, to one of those higher conditions, which it may be supposed to be designed to reach, only through long ages of probation—toils ceaseless, and humiliations that purge pride of all its grossnesses. We are permitted to hear and comprehend this language of the poet, and this is all. Enough if we acknowledge its diviner impulses; if, freeing our souls, at moments, from the miserable toils and vulgar anxieties which form the clogs to the soul's progress upon earth, we occasionally give ear to the pure harmonies of the poet, while he soothes the stormy ocean around us, and subdues to repose the vexed and vexing billows of passion in our hearts. Our merit will be quite sufficient, if we incline our ears to the poet without seeking to emulate his song; enough if we comprehend the divine utterance which we cannot hope to imitate. Still we may yearn to employ this speech. It is desirable that we should. It is desirable as a motive to honorable ambition— “Fame is the spur which the clear spirit doth raise To scorn delights,” that we should seek to speak this language; and, for another reason—that, as it is unattainable by G2 the unendowed, it should leave us always discontents. Editor.—And is discontent, Father, a desirable condition for humanity? Abbot.----The most desirable of all! The very condition which constitutes the lot of man on earth. It is through this condition only that he finds the usual stimulus to performance. Were it not for this he would do nothing and be nothing. We prattle a great deal very absurdly about content; and what is hope itself but a happy sort of discontent? It tells us of unattained objects and conditions, and so paints their attractions to our mind, that we naturally yearn and strive for their acquisition; and hence our best performances. Man, as an inhabitant of earth—as man—was never meant to be satisfied with his condition. He is still evermore afflicted with aspirations after the possible—the vague—the, perhaps, unattainable! In this yearning he establishes his ideal; and the pursuit of his ideal affords the clue to his existence. It is thus that he works out his deliverance. It is thus that he finds out and exercises his powers; and shows what are his highest conceptions of the Deity, as well as of his own nature. The Mahometan's dream of Heaven, for example, is one of sensual delights and physical repose. He dreams that he shall sleep in Heaven, on couches of amaranth, tended by houri's—beings of celestial origin, but meant as ministers to the faithful among the sons of earth. He is not tasked with cares, nor required to serve. He does not even engage in hosannas to a common sovereign. All his being lapses away in dream and reverie, and the gratification of simply voluptuous fancies, without physical effort. At most, he amuses himself with archery, which the Prophet seems to have exulted in as a practice of delight almost too good for earth! But, with the Christian philosopher, the future is a world for struggle and conquest, the same as this; for exercise and continual achievement, for which the present is a mere ordeal and preparation. I say Christian philosopher, mark you, and not Christian simply. I am afraid that too many professing Christians look forward to a Heaven, in which, if the delights be not sensual exactly, they are yet designed to minister to the desire of ease, and repose from struggles, which always made them groan and grumble under their fardels, throughout the preliminary state, as a very much ill-used people. This was certainly the Puritan philosophy, with a difference. They were too much given to insist upon themselves as the suffering Saints, having title to, if not tenure of, the Lord's possessions upon the earth, to forego, at any time, the free use of its fruits in their season. We all seek our ideals, and, in so doing, declare the degree of elevation in our thoughts and sensibilities. The world knows no higher ideals than those of the poet. If we give him our ear, he invariably conducts us out of the present. That is something. He lifts us from the earth. That is something more. He thus weans us from the pleasures of the sense, and raises us up from the wallow into which the brutal parts G3 of our nature would constantly conduct us. In this lies one secret, and not the largest of his usefulness. This is enough for us; and, in the employment of this influence the poet shares with us his nature and his gifts. The natural tendency, struggling as we do, with petty daily necessities, and against special social vanities, is continually downward. The fine arts, of which poetry is the most supreme, are perpetually interposing to arrest or to modify this tendency. In this office they are potent handmaids of religion, which has at heart this object only; and even when serving us simply through the tastes, they operate wonderful results in behalf of the higher objects of the soul. You are passing now two of the churches upon the Island. Is religion aided in her objects, think you, when the passer by smiles, or sneers, at the dwelling to which we implore the presence of Jehovah? Our tastes should no more be allowed to contemn, in religious matters, than our philosophy. We can understand why a temple of God, in a small community like this, need not be a massive, or of immense structure. But surely, society should not allow itself to be in possession of any arts superior to those with which she builds to her Creator. If you lack the material for building, the money, or the architect, why, then, the excuse for a wretched temple is legitimate. But where you possess the means, and where you have the necessary arts, such structures as these are not only discreditable to our tastes, but to our religion. In other words, we employ a superior art in the erection of a stable or a kitchen, to that which we summon to our service in rearing the temples of the Lord. You require Him to occupy a dwelling in which you would not deign to reside yourself. I have alluded to the expense of a good structure. I need not to have done so. It is just as cheap to build a good, as a bad structure. The same money which has been expended on these buildings, with the usual expense of repairs upon them, for ten years past, would have put up pleasing and graceful edifices, to which the eye of taste would incline, as well as religion. To build symmetrically, and according to the laws of art, is not necessarily to build expensively. To make a fine house, seldom costs more than to make an atrocious one! This is the secret of art! She builds economically because she wastes nothing. She builds securely and durably, because she builds symmetrically. The secret of strength is quite as much in the symmetry of the structure as in its materials. It is to this that we owe the wonderful preservation of so many monuments of ancient art, which have been preyed upon by storm, siege, fire —the wilful assaults of man, and the corroding and sapping influences of time. The building gains nothing in strength, from the enormous bulk of the mass. A well sprung arch will tie the granite together in bonds which neither storm nor fire can rend asunder, but it must be the hands of art which must forge the bolts for their union.— We have been accustomed to leave these matters to the mechanic. But the mechanic seldom aims, or pretends to be an architect. He has quite enough to do in carrying out the plans of the architect. G4 We have buildings among us—churches —which contain unnecessary brick enough to wall the city! Some of our towers were made so massive with brick, as to split and crack, and sink, and cave in, and yawn—leaving the proprietors doubtful whether the foundation would endure its own weight, to say nothing of that of the spire which it was designed to sustain! It was very easy to respect such a doubt, and to forbear all further experiments, when it was found that the money, raised for the steeple, was all consumed in the foundation. You perhaps recall the doggrel which sang of a “Christian people, Who built a Church in Meeting-street, But could'nt raise the steeple.” The Church alluded to, has, of late years, repaired its short comings. But we still see others about the city—crude, unfinished monstrosities of architecture—discrediting equally taste and religion— without plan or purpose—symmetry or strength— great barn-like fabrics, with porches and pediments that seemed to have been fashioned after an awkward squad of revolutionary officers, six portly legs and pursy bodies, with one great sharp cock'd hat upon the heads of the entire line. I repeat, it is just as easy and cheap to build a fine fabric, in good style, according to proper laws of taste, as to build a mean one; and that the secret of durableness consists much more in the symmetry and just proportions of the structure, than in the materials which you employ. A house, for example, of soft and inferior brick, well planned, well covered, with ample eaves and cornice, and plaistered or stuccoed, will last just as long as the same building made of the best brick, and finished in the same manner. Nay, it will last much longer, indeed, if while the proportions of the former be in accordance with the laws of art, the latter issues from the hands of a hodman in the business. Editor.—I am curious, Father, about the new Hotel on the Island. I confess to great anxiety as to its establishment. Abbot.—Be at ease on the subject. It will be built. It will be done effectually, and in proper manner. I have enjoyed an hour of prevision, my son—a peculiar faculty, you are aware, which I possess—which enables me to satisfy all your doubts, and to soothe all your anxieties. I can give you the whole particulars relating to the Island House, though nothing has yet been resolved upon. But all will happen as I tell you. We will wait till our scape-graces come up—I see them now approaching—when you shall have the full history of the Hotel, its site, its style, its extent, and all that belongs to the subject. In the meantime, before I forget, let me remind you of something which was said in a previous conversation, in regard to the tenure by which lots are held on the Island. It was then assumed that the grant was from O'Sullivan. This may be so; yet, in the absence of proof, it is well to know what old Jack Drayton says on the subject. You will find at page 206 of his “View,” a paragraph which states that the first settlement of Moultrieville “was about the year 1791, when the Legislature passed a resolution permitting people to build there on half acre lots; subject, however, to the condition of being removed whenever demanded by the Governor or Commander-in-Chief. Of course, this contemplates nothing more than the exigencies which might follow from invasion; when it might be necessary to convert the whole island into a fortress. The eastern extremity, which was threatened when Sir Peter Parker assailed Fort Moultrie, should certainly have its defences also.— Drayton mentions further, that the island was at one time well wooded, and continued so till the year 1700, when, by an act of Assembly, the trees were cut down; a few prominent ones excepted, which were left standing as marks for pilots.— What motive could have prompted this proceeding, seemingly so barbarous, is not said. Drayton refers to Trott's Laws, p. 81, where probably the preamble of the act affords the motive. Invasions from French and Spaniards were common about that period, and Pirates frequently made the coast, its inlets, creeks, and marshes, their secret places of resort. They might well have sheltered the masts and spars of their little crafts, behind a clump of forest trees, invisible from the city, whence, were there presence suspected, they might have been pursued, or signals given to the unsuspecting merchantmen, approaching the shore, for whom they lay in wait. The commerce of Charleston suffered dreadfully from these marauders, whom, under irresponsible administrations, her people had rather encouraged. You are aware, perhaps, that the Pirates walked the streets of that good city with impunity, not only tolerated, but in favor with the people. Editor.—Is it possible? Abbot.—The secret was this. The Pirates were good Britons. They preyed only on the Spanish galleons, and filled their beakers only from the wines of the French Islands. They were, therefore, our natural allies. The French and Spaniards were, in that day, our natural enemies. Charleston encouraged the pirates, as Queen Elizabeth did; and for the same reason. Her mariners held the doctrine, that there was no peace beyond the Line; and the cavaliers of Carolina esteemed this doctrine to be not a bad one, in a period when an English Monarch knighted Morgan, the Buccaneer. Subsequently, however, when the British Government, threatened equally by France and Spain, was compelled to frown down the piracies practised in her name in the seas of America, South-Carolina was made to pay the penalty of the eccentricities in morals of the mother country. The Pirates who were denied to enter the port which once received them graciously, became its bitter assailants—watched its entrances day and night, carried off its rich merchandizes, and more than once laid the city itself under contribution. Remind me at a moment of greater leisure of this matter, and I will tell you some curious pirate traditions of these very islands.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">X. Mine Host.—Venerable Father, and you, Reverend Brethren, I pray ye consider yourselves at home. Hold me as a serving brother only, and command accordingly. These fish are the very best that swim—at least to my notion. They are the Cavalli. Here is butter, fresh from my own poor dairy; and these eggs were laid, according to instructions, the moment I heard of your coming. My hens have had their training. I find them as docile as my neighbor, Truesdell, finds his oysters. Here, also, are some cream cheeses, the receipt for preparing which is peculiar. I procured it from a traveller who brought it from Bagdad. It had there the traditional reputation of having been the favorite dish of the famous Caliph, Haroun Al-Raschid. Of course, I have not omitted hominy. That dish I hold to be the sine quá non in a Carolina breakfast. But this is prepared of no common corn. It is from a peculiar grain called the silver eye. I beg that you will say nothing of it to John Michel, or h'll be for crossing and improving it. Now, I have a weakness in regard to this grain. I do not wish its virtues perilled by any experiments. It may undergo change, indeed, and that change may be improvement; but my taste is now so admirably accommodated to the commodity, as it is, that I fear I should suffer some loss of appetite, were I conscious of any variation in its flavor. These rice waffles I can commend to you, and the flappers and griddle cakes. Estifania, my housekeeper, has a rare capacity in breadstuffs. She is the very flower of my household. Abbot.—Blessed is the woman that hath the approbation of her master! Such a being is not to be carved out of common wood. I can believe all her merits. My nostrils agreeably confirm all the impressions of mine eyes. You have made princely provision for us, Mine Host, and you have our blessings. The gods keep your larder always full, your fowls always prolific, and your wine always ripe, cool, and abundant. Receive from my paternal hands the badge of our order. Mine Host.—Holy Father! This is too much. It is overwhelming! I had never dreamed of such proud distinction. Abbot—Modesty is the jewel of youth. Look up, my son, and take heart. It is well to feel humility, but not to sink under it. Henceforth, be known to the order as Brother Bonhommie! Our tenets and faith shall be opened to you at the first solemn chapter which we hold hereafter. For the present, Brother, do thine office. The Cavalli, if you please. You do no less than justice to this hominy, which you are right in assuming to be the essential on a Southern breakfast table. Maize is one of the noblest of the breadstuffs. We owe something to the red men for that which we inherit from them. That you have improved upon it, by judicious culture and selection, is to your own honor. It is the curse of too many of our planters, of the Low Country, that they do not attend to their own farmsteads. What can the overseer know where the master knows nothing? This absenteeism—this wandering off into distant and ungrateful States—wasting profligately, in foreign expenditure, the substance drawn ruthlessly from the bowels of our own—is a crime no less than a folly! Our misfortunes are almost wholly due to this single cause; for the practice not only involves us in a waste of substance, but a waste of time, which is more valuable still. The waste of time involves all sorts of wastes, not the least of which is the waste of intellect. No man's mind can possibly improve, who has no habitual occupation. All progress fails in the community, or with the class which devolves its duties wholly on subordinates. Editor.—But, Father, the climate of our Low Country,—so fatal to the white race. Abbot.—I have not lost sight of this matter, my son. There is something in it, but not every thing. Many need not leave their homesteads at all; and many need not go far. Settlements are to be found within ten miles of almost every rice plantation in the Low Country, where the summer might be passed in healthy security. But look at those who come to Charleston—and the Island. Need they be idle because they leave their plantations? Could they not do as has been done here, by our worthy brother, Bonhommie? Surely, there is nothing in the native character of this soil, but sterility; yet, what has art and industry already achieved for this isolated spot! Here has he snatched from the desert a pretty little cantle. He hath made the wilderness to blossom as the rose. With honest pride, and parental pleasure, doth he behold his pigs and his poultry. See how his peafowls, and his turkies, his ducks and his chickens throng about his footsteps as he approaches. Even those chickens, which, in the earliest stages of their growth, exhibit but downy and unfeathered extremities, they have a chirp of welcome and affection for the hand that scatters forth the pea and grist to them at night, and noon, and morning. Verily, Brother Bonhommie hath reason to be happy. He is a benefactor to the inferior. But his boast is larger still, when he casts his eye over his little territory and sees its increase. With what pride doth he behold his fields smiling in green and grain—his mammoth pumpkins, of a rich golden yellow, rolling about among his hillocks, like so many great turtles on the beach, turned over by the captors, and showing their yellow bellies to the sun. See him, as we did this morning on our arrival, thrusting his fingers into his potato beds, to assure himself of the dimensions of his yams! Hear him discourse of the cabbage and cauliflower, in his own domain, as of treasures which, some day, should emulate those of Dr. Bachman and Captain, Paine; and while he points out his cornfield, his eye glistens with the secret hope which inspires him to persevere in the laudable ambition to rivel Michel, in making his hundred and five bushels of flint to the acre! Bonhommie.—Oh! Father, such praise! Abbot.—Nay, blush not, my son. Thou hast done much in thy day and generation. Thy brethren will be careful of thy fame—it is a common property. Suppose, now, that our worthy planters, who have left their plantations on the plea of malaria, had gotten themselves little farmsteads on the Neck, or in St. Andrew's, to which they could have gone daily, and there perfected themselves in the knowledge of their vocation by daily and diligent toils and studies, trying all manner of easy experiments under the guidance of thought and science, how different would have been their fortunes, and how much more beautiful and prosperous the country! Look at the scene now between Line-street and the Four Mile House: what a garden has it become within the last ten years. Twenty years ago the greater part of it was a common, the farms mostly abandoned as worn out and exhausted. What blathering stupidity is in such a phrase. It is not possible for us to exhaust the earth's resources, even should we try. It is true, that a culture the most wretched, and a system the most wasteful and improvident, did all that could be done towards this unhappy consummation. But the thing was impossible. The earth cannot fail us. To the industrious man it was given for an eternal heritage. It has sustained a thousand generations which have gone before him—it will sustain thousands of generations which are to follow after him. The long tract of ages, countless and unfathomable, behind and before us, dazzles the imagination and defeats the judgment. We are bewildered with the vain attempt to enumerate the various races which have risen from and sunk into that almighty bosom; which have fed at its exhaustless granaries, and which will continue to find ample provision upon its surface to the very crack of doom. There is no such thing as exhausting the earth. You may impoverish it by barbarous cultivation, and profligate waste; but leave it to itself, fly from it, surrender it once more to its Creator, and lo! the event of a single season. The grass comes forth from the eternal principle of germination which is everywhere intact and indestructible. The trees re-appear, and cover and beautify its surface. The work of decay which goes on annually among their leaves, suffices to refresh and reinvigorate the soil upon which they perish; and the new forest which once more protects it from the sun, proves the munificence of God, which thus wondrously repairs the wastefulness of man. These few truths prove every thing. It is enough for us that they prove one thing: that he will reap who sows, and reap only as he sows; that labor, governed by thought, will effectually keep the earth from exhaustion; and that cultivation, so far from impoverishing, if judiciously managed, must always improve the soil. Bonhommie.—I believe it: I know it, Father. See to the mountain of sedge which I have gathered for manure. The late gale brought me in, to the very edge of my enclosure, as much as I can haul and gather in the next six weeks. I feel sure that a man who makes manure of good quality, in abundance, may make a soil what he pleases, and raise every thing upon it. Abbot.—No doubt of it, my son; and the process is comparatively an easy one. In fact, I regard agriculture as really the simplest and most obvious of all arts—as really teaching its own processes, H inevitably—if the heart of the cultivator goes with his occupation, as it should in every business. There was surely nothing either very mysterious or very intricate, in the labors which were required by the Deity at the hands of man. In the sweat of his brow—such was the simple form of that decree which was to be the elementary law of his existence—he was to earn his bread. Whether easy of compliance, or not, no law could have been more obvious and simple; and even now, perverted by evil counsellors, and misled, as we have been, by false lights and vitiating habits, it appears to me that a prompt return to its provisions will bring back the fertility to our fields, and prosperity to our homesteads. No books are needed for the tuition of those who obey this law. No recondite sciences need to be explored. That degree of observation and thought, which are the inevitable fruit of industry, will bring us more knowledge in a single season, than can be gleaned from all the heavy volumes ever yet written by grave and scholastic self-sufficiency. “Experience,” says the Roman poet, whose moral maxims for the agriculturist should be got by heart by every planter,— “Experience best forelearns Where best to sow, where best to reap, discerns.” In the earth itself, the teacher and the treasure lie buried together. The ancients did not vainly fable, when they proclaimed Plutus to be the god of the subterranean regions. There, in truth, he sits, enthroned amid the equal splendors of his metalic, his mineral and his vegetable worlds. We have only to dig for his possessions. Editor.—But, Father, you would not exclude book learning in agriculture? Abbot.—I exclude no learning in anything, where learning would be useful. But first assure me that it is learning, and not the vain speculations of those who do all their planting in their writings, and never in their fields;—who undertake to teach others, without being successful themselves. I say to the planter, as I say to all the arts and professions—get knowledge wherever you can find it. But how much knowledge, of a truly valuable kind, can you get by the common course among us of asking questions. You concur with a man who complains of hard times and an unprofitable staple, and he straightway calls upon you to tell him what he shall do. How unmanly and unbecoming it is that people should be running hither and thither from their fields, asking counsel, in their own professions, from those who are no older than themselves. A man who has been brought up a planter, should know his own business surely. Let him put his questions honestly and manfully to the soil itself, and I guarantee that he will never want an answer long. It is not denied that a good farmer may occasionally receive information from his neighbor; but a good farmer is one who will seldom need to inquire; and the principle which we would inculcate, is the one equally broad and simple, that a devout and undivided attention to one's own interests, will be the best mode of learning how to conduct them. It is H2 so, not in planting, simply; but in every thing—in all the trades, professions and occupations of life. Agriculture is one of many arts, all of which, so far as they relate to their professors, have the same governing laws. The planter must be prepared by a continual study of the plant itself; he must first learn the nature of the soil which it loves; the temperature which delights it; the degree of shadow or sunlight which it needs, or can endure; and adapt the soil to the plant, and both, as well as he may, to the fluctuations of the seasons. Virgil teaches this doctrine in more elevated language: “Ere virgin earth first feels th' invading share, The genius of the place demands thy care; The culture, clime, the winds and changeful skies, And what each region bears and what denies.” How little of this knowledge can one obtain from his neighbors. How much by a patient and dutiful attention to his own fields, and by a constant exercise of his thoughts upon the result of his observations. This course alone can teach him what it is necessary for him to know. No man ever yet became a good planter, or a good anything, from asking questions; for, indeed, such a person, like Pontius Pilate, though he asks for the truth, is seldom willing to wait for the answer. Our oracle must arise from the earth, like all other oracles; and let no man fear, if he knocks with a strong arm, and with proper courage, at the door of that ancient temple, that he will knock vainly, and without profit. The answer will be such, we warrant him, as will amply satisfy any reasonable mortal. Pass me those waffles, if you please. Bonhommie.—Father, we have a bushel of fine oysters, which Truesdell, hearing of your arrival, has sent over with his compliments. Shall we have a few of them roasted? Abbot.—No, I pray you; so far as I am concerned, let them be kept for dinner. Our brethren must answer for themselves. Omnes.—For dinner, surely. Abbot.—You have celery, Brother Bonhommie, in your garden? Bonhommie.—An abundance, Father. Abbot.—Good! Celery seems the natural adjunct of the oyster. I fancy, if he could choose his vegetable, he would decide on that. By the way, speaking of oysters, Brother Bonhommie, is any use made of those great banks which rise out of the water between the extremity of Haddrell's and your Island? They seem as regularly ranged, as if laid down by art—the moles apparently of some ancient bridge, and on the side of Haddrell's there seems an artificial causeway, as if meant to facilitate a communication from shore to shore. Bonhommie.—You are right, Father; that line of oaks which seems striding down from Haddrell's to the sea, indicates the line of causeway. The tradition is, that it was raised by Gen. Gadsden, who built a bridge across, during the time of the Revolution, in order to facilitate the escape of the garrison from Fort Moultrie, should it so happen that they were overpowered by the British. I have no doubt that the bridge did exist; for, on this side, H3 we have a wharf to correspond with the causeway opposite; but my faith in the other part of the tradition is somewhat shaken. I have not the histories at hand, but I believe, that, in the fight of the 28th of June, the bridge provided for the escape of the garrison, was one entirely of boats. Abbot.—So I think also. But the tradition may be reconciled with the history, if you will remember that the Fort sustained two actions. I have no doubt that the bridge was really built, as you describe it, to meet the exigencies of the second assault in 1780. But was it not General Pinckney, rather than General Gadsden, who built the bridge? Bonhommie.—No, Sir; it was Gadsden: and there is still extant, a lively letter of Col. Barry, the British wit, in regard to, and ridiculing it. I have also in my possession the extract of a letter to Hon. George Bryan, of Pennsylvania, dated 14th March 1778, which confirms it. The writer says, “This harbour is well fortified, and their bridge from Sullivan's Island is an amazing work —nöthing like it on the continent. It is called Gadsden' bridge, from General Gadsden, who had the direction of it.” Abbot.—That should be conclusive. It is greatly to be regretted, that we have not a bridge there now. It would increase the securities of the settlement, and afford the means for some delightful drives at Haddrell's, giving variety to the amusements of those who find time hang heavily on their hands at all watering places. Let us hope when the new Hotel is built, and the Island thronged with the wealthy and elite of our middle and mountain country, that the old connection between the two places will be re-established. The work would neither be unsafe nor expensive. The distance is not great, and the water is comparatively shallow, almost too shallow for steamboats.— But let us not forget the oysters. They belong, on those banks, to the raccoon tribe, a small long pointed oyster, growing in immense clusters, and sticking together with all their heads upwards, like a close knit family of ancient Hunkers. Beauclerk.—I am told, Father, that the raccoon has an appetite for them, and goes out oytering for himself, and hence their name. It is said that he has the cunning to provide himself with a number of dry sticks, which he slyly slips into each open mouth, and the oyster perishes; the sun bursts its valves, and the raccoon feeds at his pleasure. They say also, that the oyster knows his enemy; and sometimes, while the raccoon is busy thrusting his stick into the jaws of one of the family, another pair will open, and take in his foot or tail. He will then be kept fast until the tide rises and drowns him, or the sharks snatch him away. Abbot.—Invention has been bnsy for our benefit in these stories. What does Brother Bonhommie have to say? Bonhommie.—I have heard these stories and many others. One of them occurs in connection with the question of the holy Father, touching the uses of the raccoon oyster. Until a comparatively recent period, they were as much eaten as any other in our harbor. Half that were sold in our H4 market belonged to this family. They were gathered chiefly by old negro women, who fished for them in dug-outs. But since the Yankees took up the business, they have driven Sally, and Sukey, and Mimy, and Ba'sheba, pretty much out of sight. But a succession of mighty bad scares, contributed something towards directing the old ladies to a safer occupation. On one occasion, a devil-fish received the anchor, or grapnel, of one of the boats, within the capricious vortex of his antennæ, and made off with it. It was the first time that any of the African race had seen iron swim. But a more serious fright was in reserve for an old negro wench belonging to a widow lady of Charleston. It appears that she landed at low water on one of these oyster banks, and soon filled her dug-out. Finding the interval short and shallow between that and another bank, she fastened her boat, as she thought, securely, and waded across the intervening space. She loitered from one to the other; at length fell asleep upon one of them, and was only awakened by hearing the murmur of the waters, and feeling the surf break over her. The space between her and the point where she had left the dug-out, was widened to a chasm quite impassable to one who could not swim. The bank itself was covered; and soon the fastening of the boat became unloosed, and it was seen floating high up into the marsh. The poor wretch was in despair. The tide was still rising. The spot of bare rock which she occupied was soon reduced to a smple ring, which her person nearly covered; and in a little while, the waters were over her ancles. They continued to rise some six inches higher; and there she stood, momently expecting the billows to sweep and carry her off.— They did not, however; but a new horror, as she told it herself, shortly assailed her. Looking forth she discovered, steadily approaching, the dorsal fin of a shark. The voracious beast himself, was soon visible through the water. He had seen or scented his prey, and she watched him with all the agonies that predict a most terrible death, as he quietly encircled her narrow territory. She could see his gigantic form gleaming through the waters; and she imagined she beheld his fiery eye, gazing with all a serpent's power of fascination, directly into her own. She could neither scream nor speak, nor indeed would the effort have saved her. She could only follow his movement, wheeling as upon a pivot, as he circled the bank. The water was too shallow where she stood to suffer him to approach her in that manner which alone enables him to seize his prey. But, desperate with inflamed appetite, he dashed at her with a fearful plunge, which brought his head quite out of the water, and within a foot of her person.— Then she screamed, and, in receding from his jaws, had nearly fallen backwards into the deep. But she recovered herself; and, shivering with dread, continued to confront him. Again did he slowly move about her narrow eminence—twice, thrice—with his terrible eye watching hers.— Again, desperate as before, did he rush upwards almost to her person, his great head quite out of the water, and his long, double range of sharp H5 white teeth, broadly opening to snatch her into his jaws. But he failed a second time, and drew off, without making a third attempt, as if he had suffered some hurts, probably from scraping upon the sharp oyster-beds, in those which he had made already, But he did not abandon the spot. Still, round and round the bank, did he perform his constant evolutions, until the poor negro was almost ready to resign herself to fate, and fling herself into his jaws in despair. But, at this juncture, some oyster hunters, like herself, discovered her predicament, and came to her relief. I have heard that she gave, in a single sentence, the whole terrible agony of that fearful trisl: “God a'massy, I bin dead tousand times dat day!” Editor.—When did this happen? Bonhommie.—Oh! it was long ago! I forget when I heard it. Abbot.—Quite a scene, my son; and, I think, in all probability true. The shark has been known to rush clean out of the water, assailing a man in a boat. It is curious he prefers white to black meat. He will pass a negro in the water to get at a white man. This might be in consequence of his seeing the white skin more readily than the black. It is one of the admirable advantages of Sullivan's Island, that bathing here is so easily rendered safe. The power of the surf itself, secures you from his assaults; and the surf line gives you security against the retiring floods. On the back beach you have no surf;—but, higher up,— here, where you abide, my son—the marsh tracts interpose for your safety, and these creeks are at once noble and secure bathing places. Where do you propose to plant your oysters? Bonhommie.—In the basin, Father, from which you see the carts now hauling. I shall make ample provision, in future, for the reception of the brotherhood. In another year, I hope to be the father of a thriving family, which, in comeliness of outline, plumpness of form, and sweetness of flavor, shall equal those of Truesdell. But come, Father, if you have finished. I will conduct you through the myrtles, where we find a shady horse-back ride to the end of the island. Abbot.—A moment, my son, while give thanks and invoke a blessing.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">XI. Bonhommie.—Our horses are ready, Father, for the canter. Abbot.—Boots and saddles! I am ready also. Let us mount. Bonhommie.—We commence our ascent here, at the foot of Prospect Hill. We have a pleasant ride from this point, all the way to the eastern end of the Island, through a grove of myrtles, which affords us shade, and through which, with a little grading and trimming up, we might have a path-way for a carriage The ascents are easy—the undulations, though frequent, are slight, and the breezes of the sea gratefully fan us throughout the progress. Abbot.—These are hills. Your foreign tourist might smile at such a designation for them; but all things are relative; and, once familiar with the general dead level of the Island, but little above the sea, the eye acknowledges the dignity and importance of these sandy hammocks. What a curious spectacle do they present! Here, on one hand, the south and southeast lie spread out, a vast stretch of sand and sea. The plain of earth, I suppose, extends for nearly half a mile, before it touches the billows. Of this stretch, more than a hundred yards at low water, is the firm and sounding beach. Beyond that is the great blue ocean, spreading away into the infinite distance, beguiling the imagination into unknown realms and regions. In all the space of sandy tract, on this hand, there is not a shrub large enough to make a toothpick. But, on the left, north and northeast, the woods almost accumulate to a forest. The myrtle and oak, hidden from the sea by this line of hills, flourish in unsuspected size and numbers, and accordingly, in security. What a deep dell is immediately beneath our feet, in this region! How thick the growth, how grateful is the shade! Some of these great oaks were here long before the battle of Fort Moultrie; coeval, probably, with the first European knowledge of the Island. Here the Pirates may have frequently harbored— here they may have buried their treasure in secret. You are aware in what manner they usually guarded their buried treasure, and to what terrible superstitions they appealed to make it safe? Bonhommie.—I cannot say that I am, Father. Abbot.—They led some wretched captive to the spot in the depths of midnight. They chose the place of safe-keeping by the gloomy light of glaring torches. The hole was dug, not only large enough for their treasure, but for the captive. The treasure was deposited; and the sudden shot or axe, or sabre stroke, slew the victim upon it. If they had no captive, some one of their own number—some incompetent, timid, or offensive member—was butchered in his place. The victim was sometimes an unsuspecting boy—a youth, eager to win their favor, and totally ignorant of the bloody treacheries which distinguished the infernal brotherhood. The question was put in vague language: “Who is willing to stay and watch the treasure?” When the poor simpleton replied by a profession of readiness to do so, the answer was immediately accompanied with the sudden stab or shot: “Stay then, till we call for it, and see that you watch it well!” He was tumbled into the receptacle, and his sleepless ghost became the keeper of the treasure. It was the presence of this watchful spectre, that, in all the attempts of which we read, to recover the buried treasure of the Pirates, opposed his supernatural authority to the labors of the seeker; and defeated his operations, seemingly, in the very moment when he was about to obtain his wishes. His oath bound him to yield to nobody but tee Pirate crew; not even to suffer a single one of their number, without the concurrence of the rest, to pluck it from his custody. Bonhommie.—What a terrible superstition! Abbot.—It was, indeed. And the whole coast of the Atlantic, from Passamaquody to Pensacola, is full of legends derived from such superstitions, and from the character of these deadly wretches. Kidd, Teach, or Blackbeard, Steed Bonnet, and a thousand others, have left their fearful memories impressed upon these shores in every form of crime, and every character of blood. But let us descend one of these gorges into into the burial place among the myrtles. I have heard of the place, but have never beheld it. Even here, it seems, death has found his victims—here, where salubrity speaks in the ever murmuring breezes, and in the incessant rolling of these surges on the shores. Bonhommie.—The graves are not numerous, Father, and most of them are of very ancient date, probably even beyond the revolution. Abbot.—The place is very still and solemn!— How well chosen! How peaceful is the hush which prevails above the scene! How much does that line of hills conceal from the passing world without. The billows break not here.— Their loudest murmurs subside here into faint, sad harmonies that suit the quiet purposes of death. Here are some noble oaks sheltering the repose of unknown inmates. The names, none of them appeal to my memory. How lightly, in such cases, do we pass over such memorials—as if man recognized no kindred, no sympathy, at least, with any of the race, his own family or his own associates excepted. Yet these sleepers had friends and kindred. They were nursed by dear affections. They inspired hopes of the future—vague, beautiful, perhaps magnificent hopes—in the bosom of fond and generous parents. What if we could follow each of them, from the beginning to the close of his career? It is, perhaps, a mercy that we may not. The shroud of death is a mantle also. We should be grateful for what it conceals, satisfied that the judgments of Heaven, tempered by the mercies of a common Father, can never be more severe than those of man. Doubtless, most of these sleepers were poor, struggling daily for the bitter bread of labor, too frequently prosecuted without any adequate reward. Their friends were likely to have been of the same class. Yet, a true affection has gleaned from its little means, to rear the headboard of stone or wood, to the object of its sympathy. Here and there, an unintelligible initial appears. To us, its says nothing; but there were some from whose eyes it compelled instant overflow. Others are obliterated quite; and here are the outlines of the grave upon the earth, without any other memorial. No doubt, the inmate slheps quite as soundly, as those for whom an ostentatious memory would raise the temple. What an absurdity, it seems, that we should fondly desire to enjoy the memories of those we leave behind us; since they so soon must follow also. How much more grateful, could we be sure of the fond sympathies of those who have gone before; could we be sure that our faults and offences have all been sweetly forgiven, by those whom we are sure to meet, and who are equally sure to know the full extent of our offences! Oh, brother, what a living monitor is the grave! How it speaks to pride; to vanity; to the oppressor and his victim; with what terrible threatening to the one; with what consoling promise to the other! And how much more impressive seems its voice, here, by the side of the great ocean, sounding forever in one's ears, as if an awful chaunt of eternity itself. It seems ever more to cry aloud—that dirge of winds and waters—“thus still shall our voices prevail at last over all others!” Brother, those billows will continue to speak to myriads of ages and generations, long after we, and those whom we love, are wrapt in a silence deep as that of these sleepers at our feet! Let us ride, my brother. Bonhommie.—Pursuing this grove for a while, we shall reach the foot of another gorge, by which to ascend the hills. Here, Father, you perceive, we may enjoy all the seclusion of a forest, without its interminable depths. Here is shade, quiet, and the whispering silence of the woods. Here are spots which the sun's rays never penetrate. Here one may sit and meditate over favorite hopes and studies. Here love may bring his favorite to enjoy the transport and security, of which Campbell sings so sweetly in his Gertrude. And this region is here at our feet on the one hand, while on the other is the sandy desert and the great blue ocean sea. Abbot.—Some of these gorges should be deepened, conducting, by an easy carriage ride, from the sandy tract of the southern side of the Island, to the woody ranges opposite. A brick or stone work, with a broad solid arch passing through these hills, would afford a picturesque and cavernous opening to the interior. Groves might be trimmed up among these woods, and a grotto might be established for supplying refreshments and rest to the rambler. Bonhommie.—You now catch glimpses, Father, of the farmstead of Truesdell. From that point he is monarch of all he surveys. There lie his corn, potato, peas and oyster beds. A noble creek, which, elsewhere, would be called a river, passes before his door with a free and joyous rush. You see his oyster flood-gates yonder, distinguished by the brick abutments? Do you see a group of negroes emerging from the boat, their baskets full of fish? They never cast their nets in vain. They have only to throw out the line, and they draw in whiting, cavalli, yellow tail, trout, crocus, and blackfish, in never ceasing abundance. Abbot.—What glorious and endless sport, all this, to our friends from the interior. Here, with fine boats, well covered from the sun, with ample bays, broad reserves, friths, great arms of the sea, and beautiful creeks, winding through broad green meadows, they might consume a summer in delights, conscious never of the flight of time. How gloriously comes up the breezes of the ocean. The tide is now pouring in; and, almost with the same glance, we behold the sea in all its wild and imperious life, in front, and the sweet repose which pervades the sheltered tracts of meadow, and wood, and water, in the rear. I Bonhommie.—Hold up, Father. We are now at the eastern extremity of the Island. We can go no further, except to descend upon the beach. Abbot.—Let us stop here, to look about us!— here, amidst this little clump of myrtles. What a wild and beautiful prospect. What a tract of tumultuous billows grow up before the sight! How the breakers roll up, and roar upon the shore!— How they bound, and rush, and curl over each others back, scattering themselves abroad in foam. See, they come on, like a charging host, a thousand wild steeds of the sea, champing their bits, breaking through all restraints, and dashing headlong over the shoals, as if resolute to trample them down forever. Is it an islet that rises up between us and Long-Island? It seems so, from this point of view. Bonhommie.—I frankly confess, I cannot answer your question. It certainly has the appearance. Yet I was always of the impression, that Long-Island was the next shore to the east. Abbot.—It should be explored. If we had a boat now! Yet there would be no easy crossing that breach. How the seas boil there, as if in a whirlpool. At low water it would not be so hazardous, and I should love to explore all these places—to paddle from islet to islet—to climb the sandy heights and ascertain their hollows; and to drowse away the hours with the sound of those tumbling billows always in mine ears. One might realise the charms of Robinson Crusoe, in perfecfection, along these solitudes. These islands and islets, which skirt our Southern shores, all along the Atlantic, from North-Carolina to the Bay of Pascagoula, are among the most curious and lovely features of our country. To sail among them of a rich moonlight evening, affords you continual prospects of fairy lands. They rise out of the ocean like little gems; and, with a smooth sea, the charm is rare and inexpressible—the harmony of relation between the object —the peace and beauty of the scene—the billows slightly curling upon the white sands, as if in homage, rather than hostility! The inland navigation which is thus afforded, is a singular advantage, particularly in seasons of war, to the interests of commerce. Bonhommie.—And when art and industry have converted these grey sands into green and golden gardens, such as Edisto Island, for example, how much lovelier becomes the scene. Abbot.—Our children, brother, will see a progress in this respect which has not blessed our eyes. The green spots of cultivation will be made pleasingly to alternate with these barren, but lovely wastes. Do you know any thing of the occupation and uses of Long Island? Bonhommie.—Nothing, Father. Abbot.—How pleasant would its exploration be by occasional trips from Sullivan's in midsummer. One might fish along the coasts, and spread the sail for different points with each returning day. You are aware that Clinton occupied Long-Island with his troops, when Sir Peter Parker attacked the Fort with his fleet. The attack was designed to be a combined one by land and water. I2 That frith was to be crossed by Clinton with the land forces; but we can see that the passage was no easy one, particularly at a flood tide, which was probably the period chosen for the fleet to arrange itself before Fort Moultrie. It would have been difficult for boats to have made their way through that gulph of waters, and still more difficult to have effected a landing under the fire of the Riflemen by whom this part of the Island was defended. Here Col. Thompson, of St. Matthew's, was posted with seven hundred men. He was provided with an eighteen-pounder and a field piece, which probably occupied the headland upon which we stand. His force consisted of the third South-Carolina Regiment, all superb sharp-shooters. Clinton must certainly have attempted the passage, but the effort was not a serious one. If it had been made his boats must have been swamped. His men could not have waded it without being swept away. We are told, they got entangled among the shoals. That entangleness saved them. Had they forced their way through the surges, under the mouths of the cannon, their landing must have been effected under such a terrible fire from our people, as would have doubled to the British the disasters of that sanguinary day.— The question is, had Thompson any battery, any bulwarks at all, except those afforded by nature? Another question—can this Island be held to be properly defended, unless there be a fortress at this point? Steam affords facilities now for conquest which were then unknown. It would require, no doubt, but a small fortress and a moderate garrison; since the wild force of the sea in this quarter, certainly at high water, would always contribute greatly to the strength of the place. It is probable that the Island here was once connected with Long-Island. The waves have cut for themselves an avenue. With what fury do they plunge through the gorge. Whether Sullivan's Island was not once connected with the main— whether the tract of creek, bayou and ledge, lying between Haddrell's and this strip was not once solid ground, is a question. It appears to me that such must have been the case. May we not suppose that the range of heights upon which we stand, once indicated the general elevation of the Island, reduced by the constant assaults of the sea, front and rear, until, as we know, the coean at length, in some fearful tempest, the waters of the Gulph pouring in upon us, made a clean sweep over the whole western half of the Island. I cannot persuade myself that these heights are structures reared by the sands and soil of descending rivers, or the heaped up tributes of the sea. And how reasonable to suppose that the clearing the Island partly of its timber, as Drayton tells us was the case, has been one of the causes of its depression and the subsequent encroachment of the seas. I have discovered the roots of large trees, laid perfectly bare, and lying upon the surface, along the outer margin of the southern beach. Bonhommie.—The conjecture is certainly not an unreasonable one. It should be our policy to restore the foliage to the Island, with an equal eye to comfort and protection. I3 Abbot.—Trees, the seeds of which are windsown, should be introduced for this purpose.— Such trees are generally of hardy and quick growth, requiring little soil, and spreading themselves about with amazing fecundity. They seem designed for these very situations. The Ailanthus or Tree of Heaven, is one, in particular, which might be recommended for introduction upon the Island. Bonhommie.—I shall introduce it myself, Father. Abbot.—To the people of the interior, Sullivan's Island ought to be a spot of qute as much attraction and interest, as to the people of Charleston.— Hither may they come in midsumer, and remain till frost, in perfect security, and realizing that luxury—that of salting themselves, which is a regular habit with a large portion of the Northern people. They may come and refresh themselves upon shrimps, fish and oysters, bathe in Neptune's own bath, and enjoy a thousand sports at once novel and attractive. They could visit the city daily, and attend to business; and should the city be unhealthy, could retire, in half an hour, to a scene of equal salubrity and sweetness, nor would they be without frequent spectacles of rare interest and grandeur. The broad ocean spread out before them with all his billows, ever more rolling, and ever more pouring forth a wild chaunt, whose harmonies appeal more deeply than to the ear of man—which sink deeply into the soul, and stir up the sublimer thoughts and more spiritual fancies, —is, alone, a spectacle which forever feeds the mind with pleasure. Here may the idler behold the porpoise, in vast schools, rolling and plunging with an obvious joy and luxury; and sometimes he may chance to see the mighty liviathan of our seas, the Devil Fish, famous in Beaufort annals, flinging out his gigantic but slender flippers, above the billows, as if he would embrace the passing ships. At our feet lies a proof of powers in the great ocean, the display of which, to the man accustomed only to the forest and the mountain, would be such a spectacle as his thought would brood upon for long seasons after. Here, safe, himself, might he behold the storm-spirit rioting in his native element, and the great ship, cowering and stifled in his wild embrace, lifted up, as an infant in the grasp of a giant, and flung scornfully upon the shores, as if to mock the builder and the owner, with the folly and the feebleness of his creation. It is a sloop which lies below us, half buried in the sand? Bonhommie.—A sloop, I reckon. Abbot.—Mast and spar were torn out of her in the fearful struggle, when she rushed headlong on the shores! What did mast, and spar, and bolt, and cable, avail against such an enemy? She had some fair feminine name, perhaps—a tribute of admiration to birth or beauty. She was called the “Polly Whitesides,” perhaps—the “Fanny Folsom,” or “Lucy Laidler.” But no invocation to the fair spirit, who presided at her christening could relieve her then. The skipper Hopkins— Bonhomme.—I think, Father, it was not Hopkins. I4 Abbot.—Jenkins, then, or Thompson, it matters not. He felt the gale coming on, and he knew the qualities of his clinker built clipper. He had his little son with him, Tom, I think, but we may call him Dick, or Peter, and the tender years of the boy made him thoughtful of the mother. She scarcely knew the child was out. The skipper knew she looked for them at home that night to supper, and that she felt anxious enough at the approach of the gale. Thompson had no reason to doubt the anxieties of his wife. and he was man enough to respect them. “Tom,” says he, “there's old Harry getting up, there in the southeast. Up hellum, my lad, and push for home.” Tom looked out, having never seen old Harry before. But the power of which they spoke in phrase so familiar, seemed not disposed to give them any chance; and the doubt arose, which to peril, old Thompson and his son Tom, or the fair beauties of the “Polly Whitesides.” It was a long struggle. But necessity and the storm prevailed. It was God's blessing, Thompson's working, and perhaps Tom's peculiar destiny, that enabled the father and son, to beach her here, and make their escape to the myrtles. They laid the aching ribs of “Polly Whitesides,” high and dry, upon the beach, and here she lies. But how little like the beautiful thing she was. She reminds us, Brother Bonhomme, of the cruel wreck of other beauties. But you weep.— The remembrance is a painful one, I see. Let us depart.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">XII. Bonhommie.—We are safe at home, again, Father; and see, the Brotherhood are descending from the piazza, to give us welcome. Abbot.—Something has happened. They wear faces of unwonted pleasure. They have been made happy by some peculiar event. Let us see; we have been long enough absent for a variety of events. I can conjecture the occasion. Well! my children, you seem in great spirits? Editor.—We have been honored, Father, in your absence, and chiefly on your account. The honorable Council of the Island, have been to wait upon you and us. They came in state, as is their custom, when waiting upon distinguished strangers; in a splendid barge. They have bestowed upon us the freedom of the island, and compelled us to accompany them on a fishing expedition, in which we have had a great time and caught multitudes of fish; more than seven hundred among the party, trout and whiting, sheephead and cavalli, in the space of three hours. We have enjoyed a glorious swim in the public Gondola, a glorious repast among the Island Fathers, and as much wit and humor as might suffice an ordinary brain during the summer solstice. Abbot.—My children you have been blessed and honored. I do not regret that I was not with you, for I have been sufficiently refreshed and gratified in my canter through the myrtles. But I can fancy your satisfaction; such distinctions do not wait upon ordinary men. I have heard of the wit and humor of the Council. I am told that these, along with wisdom, are among the requisites of office on the Island. Beauclerk.—Beauty also, Father. It is understood that no man becomes a candidate whose pretensions to personal beauty are not considerable. The ladies vote here, and they insist upon this quality. They assume that gentlemen of great personal attractions, are never willing to hide their light under the bushel; and take for granted that an administration of handsome men, will give them numerous balls throughout the season. They are seldom disappointed. Abbot.—Pshaw! Get thee behind me, Sathanas! Am I fit subject for thy quizzing, and at this time of day? Beauclerk.—Nay, Father, believe as much of it as you please. It might as well be true as not. It is certain that the Council of the Island has always been remarkable for the beauty of face and person among them; for their wit and wisdom; and for the number of balls which they give during the season. They reason justly, after the manner of the Government of France, and take public amusements under the patronage of Government. Editor.—We have certainly had a most delightful time of it. As a stranger, Father, you would have found yourself in the full enjoyment of the degree of love and attention which you deserve. Abbot.—As a stranger, perhaps. But say no more of it, my son. Of course, the funds of the Island justify these liberal expenditures. Beauclerk.—The receipts are not more than half a million, chiefly derived from imposts on the oyster and shrimp business. The licenses to fish in these waters are in great demand; and since the Yankees have taken to manufacture sardines out of silver fish, a new and prolific source of income has arisen from this commodity. Shrimps, too, are now put up for export to California and Patagonia, in oil, after the manner of the sardines; and there is a trembling anxiety to increase the revenue, from the anticipated uses, in the same way, of the forests of young crabs and fiddlers, which literally swarm in these diggins. It is calculated, that, from fiddlers alone, should they be found to answer expectation, the revenues will be increased to a million. The Council have it in contemplation to memorialise Congress in behalf the utter abolition of the duty on foreign oils, and, failing in this, to offer bounties to those who shall first make a profitable business of expressing the oil from the bene plant, the sunflower, and the cotton seed. The intelligence, the vigor, the liberality, with which the Government of the Island pursues its course of public policy, shows that wisdom is very far from being inconsistent with personal beauty, and the freest exercise of wit; as some grey beards were pleased, in former times, to imagine. Abbot.—Beware, son, lest thine own humors do not find thee a place in the new Calaboose, (which is to be a Penitentiary also,) which, it is said, is to be established on the Island. Here, perchance, you may find employment in preparing sardines, shrimps, and fidlers for the markets of California. Editor.—The Council did us the honor, Father, to invite us to a public dinner, which they propose to give in compliment to us to-morrow. Here is a written invitation, under the broad seal of the Island, to yourself. We excused ourselves from any immediate answer, inasmuch as we knew not what might be your purpose in respect to the future proceedings of the fraternity. Abbot.—Your caution was a proper one, my son. It will not be in our power to accept. We must decline, though we shall do so with proper respect and regret. Our time expires to-morrow. We must return to the city in the first morning boat. Bonhommie.—Alas! Father, how shall I survive your departure? Abbot.—By the consoling hope that you will live till our return, my son—that you will then be properly prepared to welcome us, by reason of the wonderful improvements which you shall have made upon your farm—in the introduction of new vegetables and fruits, and in your improvements upon the old. Your oyster reserves will then be crowded with sleek citizens, eager to open their bosoms to your friends; and your juvenile poultry will then have assumed that degree of maturity which will enable them to assist in entertaining us. We shall have more satisfaction, Brother Bonhommie, when partaking of the luxuries and comforts of your household, in knowing that they are all the products of your own ground and genius. Bonhomme.—You overwhelm me, Father.— You are too good. I have a motive to live for, if it be only to deserve your praises. Shall we sit in the piazza, Father? Abbot.—It is a sweet air, and the prospect of the sea never stales upon my sight. It is a moral prospect. It appeals to all a man's energies. It is a spectacle to stimulate courage, enterprize, progress; to brace the thought, as well as the bosom; to chasten and purify, as well as freshen and excite. There is an analogy of a very striking sort, between mountain life, and life beside the sea. In both cases, the objects of contemplation lead to elevation of thought and purpose. The natural aspects presented to the eye, are those which at once lift and depress the soul. We are raised in the contemplation of vastness; a world of distance; sublime and towering forms; vast heights that seem to stretch away to the cloud and sun; vast tracts which seem to bury cloud and sun within their bosom! The same prospects depress and humble, because they awe. They tell us at every breath, of our inferiority and insignificance. They rebuke the pertness of self-conceit, and compel the respect of vanity. And these lessons lead to reverence; to acknowledgments, which, as they teach us of a Superior, moderate our own assumptions, and force us to a recognition of the Divine Master of worlds, suns and systems. The social advantages of veneration are also incomputable. Perhaps it may be safely asserted that no man, without this quality, can ever have a proper respect for genius, art, virtue, or any great human endowment; any, and can never have any just respect for humanity itself! Editor.—You were remarking, some nights ago, Father, upon the growing deficiency of this virtue among us, when you were interrupted by that grinning and chattering mime, Chiffinch. Abbot.—The beast! I think if I were a potentate, I should make an express edict against your professional jokers—poor inflated devils, who fancy that it is a sort of duty with them to be funny. Now, nobody likes a good jest better than myself; but the first requisite of a good jest is, that it should be in season. It should be accommodated to the moods of the hearer, and not conflict with the necessities of the occasion. The jest, no less than the sermon, requires propriety for its accoucheur. Now, this is what that foolish fellow, Chiffinch, cannot understand. He thrust himself in among a knot of us the other day, when the occasion was one of deep gravity to all, and of great sorrow to one of the company;—a serious and ruinous involvement of his affairs, which might beggar a large and lovely family. We were discussing this necessity, when Chiffinch approached. Had he possessed the slightest capacity to look out from himself, he would have seen, from our faces, that we had a cause of anxiety among us which left us incapable of fun. But, espying us at a distance, he began instantly to prepare his joke,— such as it was;—and with him to conceive, implies as, a matter of course, the necessity for being delivered. He was inflated with a straw, and would have burst with it, could he have found no hearers. So he kept us for half an hour, while he drew out his slender circumstances of humour. On another occasion, he stopped a gentleman, who had just buried an only daughter, with a story of a goat and a pumpkin, and I have heard that a sack of sour meal, kept his wit sweet through the dog-days. He is a man to die of croup, in a state of second infancy. Editor.—And yet, Father, Chiffinch is, at times, exceedingly funny. Abbot.—So is Mumbo Jumbo, the African monkey, when he has his red breeches on, a feather in his hat, and has not yet danced that day. But Mumbo Jumbo, always, is a poor devil. Chiffinch needs only to know his time to be a very clever companion. If he would believe more in Solomon, and less in himself, we might almost fancy him a Solomon. Certainly, Shakspeare's counsel, properly valued, might enable wit frequently to pass for wisdom. “A jest's prosperity lies in the ear Of him that hears it; never in the tongue Of him that makes it.” But this brings us back to the subject of veneration. Veneration is necessary to wit, if the claims of the latter are to be respected. Wit, in proper hands, is the sharp and always polished rapier of wisdom. Its purpose is never wantonness. It is never drawn unadvisedly, and never works injustice. It does no wrong to a gentle and innocent nature. It assails no becoming sentiment or affection. It is legitimate only in such hands as need every sort of instrument to punish brutality, presumption and offence. In other hands, it is the sharp razor which the monkey shaves with; a weapon that most commonly cuts the shaver's throat. Veneration and wit should always harmonize; and must, for their mutual safety. The legitimacy of wit depends upon its willingness to be the subordinate. Some things are every where sacred. An earnest purpose, an honest though erring faith, and above all a manly enthusiasm! Enthusiasm, perhaps, is one of the most sovereign of the virtues. It is essential to the perfection of all the rest. It stimulates the others to performance; it sustains them during the trial and the struggle; and it soothes and cheers them in defeat. Without this virtue, socity languishes everywhere; the energies lie prostrate; the more generous tendencies of the race suffer neglect and scorn; the community lacks courage; trade and commerce wither; industry is at an end; the arts abandon the soil in loathing, or bury themselves from sight in dread and silence; while cold-blooded and soulless self-conceit sniggers and sneers at every appeal to patriotism, and every sentiment which seeks to encourage the resurrection of the nobler virtues. We have been laboring under this very curse in Charleston for twenty years. Enthusiasm has been crushed out of us by frivolity. Life was a mere drowse in the lap of vanity. Men had no high purposes, or they were frowned upon; society degenerated into a miserable pageant, in which the only struggle was, which could show himself most conspicuously in the front ranks, and with the greatest amount of tinsel. If a man rose up and spoke of a new hope, with zeal and earnestness, he was set upon as a common enemy, whose very nature was at hostility with that stagnation of social energy, which was foolishly mistaken for calm and peace. “They made a solitude and called it peace!” They had no faith in any enterprise which rebuked their incapacity; which seemed to insinuate a doubt that all was not perfect in their condition. And this condition, how joyless, how soulless, how unperforming! Society was not without its refinements, but these were of a sort that rendered it feeble and effeminate. Our polish was gained at the expense of our energies and there was no heart in it. When I was a boy, the custom was, with the close of the day's employment, to seek some friendly fireside. Here, the young of both sexes met each other. The sweetness and grace of the damsel, subdued and refined the rough vigor of the youth; the manly energy and performing thought of the youth, stimulated the mental activity, and compelled the studies of the damsel. They acted upon each other, and the result of this attrition was a calm, strong, dignified intellect on the part of both; accommodated, in each, to the proper characteristics of the sex. It is all altered now. We have become fashionable and foolish. We have the smoking and the swearing boy, the flashy and K the giggling girl. You no longer drop in, at evening, at the friendly fireside. You call in the afternoon, when you know that all are out, and leave your card; and, during the season, the cards thus left, bring you an invitation to a grand ball, and you dance and sup, and there an end. And this is society! We have exchanged a thing of simplicity and heart, for a thing of affectation, which is utterly without feeling. In the language of Wordsworth— “Altar, sword and pen, Fireside, the heroic wealth of hall and bower, Have forfeited their ancient English dower, Of inward happiness. We are selfish men.” And again: “I am opprest, To think that now our life is only drest For show: mean handiwork of craftsman, cook, Or groom! We must run glittering, like a brook In the open sunshine, or we are unblest; The wealthiest man among us is the best: No grandeur now, in nature, or in book, Delights us. Rapine, avarice, expense— This is idolatry—and these we adore. Plain living and high thinking are no more; The homely beauty of the good old cause, Is gone: our peace our fearful innocence, And pure religion, breathing household laws.” These are the evils that have got too much sway among us, and we must amend them. Editor.—We are beginning to amend them, Father. Abbot.—Not too soon, or too actively. We are doing something, I believe. But much is yet to be done. We must bring back to society its very noblest element—the one which perfects all the rest—without which all the rest is insecure— I mean veneration. There were, perhaps, but three States of the old thirteen—and these have been the chief maternal States of the Union, that ever impressed their characteristics deeply upon the character of the nation. These were Virginia, Massachusetts and Carolina. Their power lay in one great virtue, veneration. They had each of them a living and a working faith. They were earnest in their purposes. They were not to be deluded by vanities. They had pride, such as the Englishman possesses—and this led them to achievement. Their pride and faith, joined with earnestness and enthusiasm, made that great virtue which constitutes the social religion. Home was in their faith, and this conviction led them to do justice to all the constituents of the sectional character. They might be emulous of one another, but they always believed in one another. Envy did not blind them to the merits of a brother; nor vanity delude them in respect to their own. And thus they wrought honestly, to a common end, and made their country famous. Who among us is likely now to make our country famous? Honest zeal is rebuked by a sneer the moment it rises. Generous enthusiasm feels ever the curb of sceptical and denying society. Your wits, who claim to be your wise men also, are those who put their fingers to their noses, and cry “ha! ha!” whenever they behold an unselfish virtue that says: “Brethren, let us work, together for the common cause.” They say to themselves, K2 first: “What office are we to have?” Would you speak of serious topics, such as belong to the common necessity, lo you;—Senator Smirk appears, or Counsellor Quiz. They have been laboring all the morning at a joke; they have toiled all day and manufactured a pun, and they thrust themselves upon you with all your enthusiasm working in your soul—deep in your project for a common good, or to meet a threatening emergency; and, with a snigger—for a drowsy self-esteem seldom laughs quite out—they lay the little, wriggling, wormy thing before you, in the hope to make you snigger also. And this when your City is struggling to sustain position; when your great men are perishing from among you, when open and secret enemies are busy to destroy your liberties and securities! Verily, are not these, on a small scale, the Neroes that fiddled when Rome was burning? Editor.—Father, this is very terrible! Abbot.—Son, is it not very true! If it be a truth, however terrible, it is the only hope for us that there be some who will speak, and others who will see the truth. Were the disease incurable, incurable, my son, it would be only folly so to speak, or so to see. But, thank God, I see in my eye daily, troops of goodly and generous youth rising into the ranks of performance; full of soul and energy; loving their country, and anxious to achieve something in its behalf. We shall soon need all their strengh and enthusiasm; and now is the time, if ever, to cast down the false idols of society, and to show the true Gods. Now is the time to set up in high places, as models, Labor and Thought, as the only true sources of manhood and character; to teach simplicity of manners, earnestness of purpose, and that hearty courage which grapples with difficulty as with a mistress; with a love for the wrestle, and proportioned to the vigor of each youthful Sampson. My Sons, my appeal is to Young Carolina! To the veneration and the will, linked with enthusiasm, which made old Carolina famous! Omnes.—They will answer to the call. Three cheers for young Carolina! Abbot.—What a grateful augury, my children! Behold, even as you shout, that noble ship heaving in sight, and, with every sail set, pressing forward to her port. Let her be your emblem. See how she flings and scatters from her bows, the assailing billows. She how she cuts her way through the yawning deep. She compels the service of the winds. She loses no time in her progress. She puts on all her energies, and is winged for the attainment of her goal. Only fancy some of our mountain friends, here, at this moment;—men who have never beheld the ocean, nor seen those great swans of commerce, speeding over the waves with the grace and dignity of Queens. They would feel, as should we, beholding a mountain for the first time, and upon it the great world-Behemoth, about to realize the Indian tradition, and leap from pinnacle to pinnacle, onward and downward, until, at last, he buries his mighty and smoking flanks in the waters of the sea.—But where is our Poet? K3 Poet.—Here, Father. Abbot.—You improvised the other day, my son, on seeing just such a goodly vessel. I am not sure that the moral of your verse was not somewhat tinged with an unwise cynicism. I did not feel the justice of your sarcasms on Love and Friendship, for I believe in both. It is a faith that wrong and folly shall never beat out of me. Man is a better animal than we think him, and few are utterly without some redeeming virtues. You Poets are apt to mistake weaknesses for vices, and to be terrible when you should be tolerant. Nevertheless, let us have your verses. Let our brothers hear them. The picture of the ship, if I recollect rightly, exactly suits that which stretches away before our eyes. Poet.—(Recites.) How proudly o'er these swelling seas, Yon gallant vessel holds her way, Borne on the bosom of the breeze, With maiden-grace and Queenly sway; The sunlight basks upon her sails, The billows bear her gladly on, And meekly fond, the obedient gales, Attend her till her port is won. Thus, in the hour of man's success, The cringing slave becomes the tool, And Pride will stoop, though not to bless, And cringes where he still would rule; Yet let the sun but cease to glow, And falser still than wind or wave, The servile friend becomes the foe, And Pride the tyrant, late the slave! The sycophant who bow'd of yore, And lick'd the foot, nor felt the shame, Polutes the shrine he sought before, And speaks, instead of praise, in blame. Nor is it Friendship that, alone. Thus false to every faith can prove; The guilt assails a nobler one, And men have said the same of Love! Abbot.—Some truth, no doubt; but the conclusions are false, if they go to justify our want of confidence in the race; of worldly goods we may save something by our scepticism; but not to confide is to lose ourselves. Faith is the great secret for society. Believe in the family if you would prosper. You may be defrauded freqently; but it is a greater misfortune, by your own doubts, to defraud yourself of human sympathy. Bonhommie.—Pardon me, Father, but “roast beef waits for no man.” Abbot.—It seldom has need, my Son. Let us begin with Truesdell's oysters by way of appetizer.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">XIII. Abbot.—Brother Bonhommie, the lofty but, deserted dwelling house in front, reminds me of a duty. Fill your glasses, my children:—We will drink—“the Pinckney's—the noble and courteous gentlemen,—the fearless and honored statesmen, —the pure, polished and incorruptible citizens.” K4 Omnes.—Standing! Bonhommie.—There is another dwelling in sight, Holy Father, which counsels me to a similar duty:—that of Bond I'on. Father, with your permission, we will drink,—“the fine old gentleman of a better day and school: the good and benevolent man; one who has served his country faithfully, and who still serves society gratefully.” Abbot.—We drink with pleasure, my children pleased to perceive that we still possess the power of discriminating and appreciating those virtues which are not sufficiently esteemed as models.— And now, my son, let us rise. That is the true temperance which knows how to employ God's blessings without profligacy or wantonness. Let us adjourn to the piazza. It is the Wilmington steamer that goes out, I think, and there is another that comes in—see, our ship has nearly reached the city; a brig and a schooner are also in motion, and so are our Island steamers. These are the human adjuncts and agents, that animate the scene. What a picture of life is in that sea, that sunshine, those sweeping swanlike creatures, the gay and glittering hamlet of the Island, and the illuminated spires of the distant city. But the sea itself suffices me. Editor.—It would be a noble study to most persons but for its annoyances. Abbot.—These are greatly exaggerated; and are felt chiefly during the first three days of a voyage. Our coasting navigation, which seldom now keeps you out three days, does not suffice for experiment. In that period you can have only the desagremens of the sea, without its excitements.— It requires a longer time to recover the tone equally of the body and the mind, and to acquire that sort of “sea change,” of which we are told in the “Tempest,” which alone can possibly make you at home as a voyager. Then your thoughts and stomach come back to you together. Then you see the wonders of the great deep and rejoice with the rejoicing elements. Editor.—I am afraid, Father, that the sea soon loses its freshness to all but the poetical temperament. I have frequently remarked, with surprise, how little there is visible, in the progress over the great deep, to those who go down frequently in the ships upon the waters. Abbot.—It was ever thus, my son, with this class of people, even when they made their very first voyage. They never did conceive the wonders and beauties of the sea. It requires the creative and endowing faculty—the imagination for this. But the ordinary traveller does not possess much of this faculty. He fancies neither marvels nor mysteries, and solves none, unless they be those of trade. His philosophies seldom go deeper than his appetite, and if he loves the sea at all, it is because of the potent influence which it possesses in sharpening the desires of the abdomen. It is quite a study to watch this class of persons on board ship. You will find them always, either peering into the larder, or dreaming about it. The Steward, (whom they always call stewart—the vulgarians!) and cook, aboard-ship, are the persons whose acquaintance they are first to make. These they contrive to bribe with shillings and civilities. You will scarcely open your eyes, in the morning, ere you will see these “hail fellows,” with toast and tankard in their clutches. A bowl of coffee and a cracker is the initial appetizer, with probably a toss of brandy in the puple beverage, as a lacer. Then you see them hanging about the breakfast table, where they take care to plant themselves in the near neighborhood of certain of the choicest dishes. All their little arrangements are made before you can get to the table, and there will be a clever accumulation of good things about their plates, in the shape of roll and egg, etc., which would seem destined to remind the proprietor, in the language of warning, which was spoken daily (though with a far different object) to the monarch of the Medes and Persians—“Remember, thou art mortal.” This is a fact which our veterans of the high seas never forget. They carry within them a sufficient monitor which ever cries in their ears, like the daughter of the horseleech, “Give, Give!” They have no qualms of conscience or of bowels; and it seems to do them rare good to behold the qualms of others. It would appear that they rejoiced in these exhibitions, simply as embodying the assurance that the larder was destined to no premature invasion, on the part of the sufferers. I have often looked upon this class of travellers—not with envy—Heaven forefend!—though it would have rejoiced me frequently, at sea, to have possessed some of their immunities—that rare insensibility, for example, in the regions of diaphragm and abdomen, which, if unexercised for appetite, might at least suffer other sensibilities to be free for exercise. But it has provoked my wonder, if not my admiration, at that inflexible stolidity of nature, which enabled the mere mortal so entirely to obtain the ascendancy over the spiritual man. He sees no ocean waste around him—follows no tumbling billows with his eye—watches not with straining eagerness, where the clouds and the waters, descend and rise, as it were in an embrace of passion.— Sunrise only tells him of his coffee and cracker— noon of lunch,—sunset of his tea,—and the rarely sublimed fires of the moonlight, gleaming from a thousand waves, suggest only a period of repose, in which digestion goes on without any consciousness of that great engine which he has all day been packing with fuel. Tell him of porpoise and shark, and his prayer is that they may be taken. He has no scruples to try a steak from the ribs of the shark, though it may have swallowed his own grandmother. Of the porpoise he has heard, as the sea-hog, and the idea of a roast of it, is quite sufficient to justify the pains-taking with which he urges upon the foremast man to take his place at the prow, in waiting, with his harpoon. Nay, let a school of dolphins be seen beneath the bows, darting along with graceful and playful sweep, in gold and purple,—glancing through the billows, like so many rainbows of the deep,—he thinks of them only as a fry—an apology for whiting and cavalli, for which he sighs with the tenderest recollections. Such is very apt to be the character of your veteran voyager; and, with him, let me assure you, the novelties of the sea never had a charm. In losing its sense of freshness, he never lost a single fancy. Editor.—Steam has robbed the sea pretty equally of its terrors and its charms—I mean to the great mass of persons, Father. To a certain class of persons—“a thing of beauty is a joy forever.”— You now scarcely make the acquaintance of the deep before you leave it; you are not sufficiently long upon the waves to feel the caprices of the winds; you are hardly ever out of sight of land. Even when crossing the “great pond,” you travel in such mighty vessels, and carry with you such a various community, that you scarcely feel conscious of any change, restraint, or inconvenience.— You have society in abundance, books, sports, balls, and dinner parties, to say nothing of tableaux vivants, and ocean theatricals. In our short voyages along the coast, from town to town, upon the sea—as in the route from Charleston to Wilmington—you are out but a single night, and have seen nothing. You fling yourself into your birth in the one city, to awaken in the other. Few persons care to look abroad in this interval. Few care to traverse the ship's deck in the face of smoke and steam, to catch glimpses of mysterious forms, wrapped up, but not concealed, in the billows rolling by—that recall to you as they pass, strange but sweet reminiscences of friends left, or friends lost; friends whom you are about to visit, and friends whom you are never more to see. You see now-a-days nothing of the wonders of the deep. You hearken to none of its voices. The spell has been taken from its fountains—the trident is broken in the grasp of its Triton. The old fables have been driven away by that inveterate smoker which the world has agreed to call by the name of Steam! Mighty world, before which— “The sea— Its deep green mansions, and it sparry caves, Its shells, its naiads, and its warring waves; Its stirring dangers, its great terrible things, Monstrous and savage, that, from secret springs Course in pursuit of prey—” are puffed away, as by a breath—disarmed of all but its tributary and subservient attributes, and rendered as patient as the wild horse under the lasso—subdued, from a condition more wild than his, to the will and domination of man. Beauclerk.—How happy was that prediction of Darwin with regard to the future uses of steam. Abbot.—Repeat, my son. The poets are the only prophets. Beauclerk.— “Soon shall thy arm, unconquered steam, afar Drag the slow barge, or drive the rapid car; Or on wide waving wings expanded bear The flying chariot through the fields of air. Fair crews triumphant, leaning from above, Shall wave their fluttering 'kerchiefs as they move; Or warrior bands alarm the gaping crowd, And armies shrink beneath the shadow cloud.” Abbot.—Darwin wrote—I speak from memory —about 1790. The railroad and steamboat have realised his predictions in regard to them. It remains that the balloon shall come into general use for the purposes of war and travel. I see, recently, that it was gravely proposed to employ balloons in the bombardment of Venice. Certainly, the idea must be a terrible one to a city: that of having paixhan shot tumbled in upon them from the clouds! By the way, are you aware, my children, that the Spaniards have put in a claim, on behalf of one of their mariners, as the first inventor of steamboats? It precedes all others— Fitch, Fulton—Scotchman, Englishman, American. It depends upon the authenticity of the documents which have been brought to establish the claim. The allegations and dates would seem to be conclusive. Editor.—You have been a great reader, Father. Abbot.—And not always a profitable one. My memory begins to fail me, from the simple fact that it never received good training. I was desultory as a reader. But that was not an error or a misfortune. It is a vulgar mistake to object to desultory reading. The more desultory the better. This has been the sort of reading which has distinguished most great men. It is, perhaps, the very reading to bring the individual judgment into full play. Read but one order of writings, and you are very apt to imbibe your opinions tacitly— to accept them—and without investigation. But reading variously, by compelling you to decide between adverse authorities, brings your own thoughts into exercise. You are required then to think as you read, not gulph and swallow merely. Read everything, my children. But, mark you, I do not counsel desultory studies—study the one thing, which is your peculiar vocation, and you may read every thing besides. It is my misfortune that my youthful habits were not studious. I confess my boyhood to have been a truant one. Grammar was my abomination, and I know nothing about it now; Arithmetic, a terrible torture that kept me sleepless, unless I skulked it, which I was very apt to do. Certainly, I thought that no Christian soul could reproach me for endeavoring to escape such cruel persecutions. What I might have been, or become, with proper training, is scarcely proper for discussion. It suffices that, though I do a great deal of what the world calls “work,” I regard myself as really but an idler.— The habits of my boyhood were the fruits of a neglect which, considering the present happy indolence of my life, it would not become me to deplore. My irregularities in youth brought me no punishment. I had no parents to be troubled at my absence, or to chide and chasten me at my return. My guardian was very much a person after my own heart. He partook largely of my nature, and craved nothing more earnestly than repose. So that I trespassed not upon his leisure, I might do as I pleased with my own. My school-master was one of those trading professors who come from abroad, for no better purpose than money-making. He was not only dishonest, but incompetent; and I now look back with absolute surprise to the fact, that, with so slender a capital of sense and acquirement, he should have been suffered so long to defraud the community, and defeat the purposes of nature in the sixty children committed to his care. He knew nothing of the minds or of the temperaments of his pupils. He taught us very much as a drill sergeant would have done, but without his rigor. The boys were ranged in classes according to their sizes. The tallest formed his upper, the smallest, his lower classes. Certain tasks in memory were set them, which they acquired or not, at pleasure. He did not punish, for that would have irritated all parties—the children, the parents and himself. The former were pleased with him, as they were neither tasked nor punished; the parents were content, since their sons were so, and since they always received an admirable account of their progress from the master; and he was satisfied, as he grew wealthy upon a rare repose. Editor.—Here were the seeds then planted of all your Epicureanism, Father. I do not use the word, of course, in its vulgar sense. Abbot.—Truly; I understand you. My philosophy, which has commended me to my present dignities, was a simple one. It had its seeds sown, as you say, under that scoundrelly school-master. To economize and cherish the pleasant associations of life, and fly from those which are humiliating and painful, was my school boy instinct, long before my reason taught me to adopt it as a philosphy. It was the instinct, probably that made the philosophy reasonable. It came in admirable conflict with the duties of the school boy. Accordingly, the sixth day in the week did not prove sufficient for my necessities. I made a holiday of sundry more. Monday frequently found me upon the highways, and Tuesday upon the sea-shore; Wednesday was a famous day in our almanac of plasure, and Saint Thor, as we all know, confers special privileges on the succeeding day, upon every young Goth who remembers his Teuton original. Friday we are apt to surrender as an act of grace to the pedagogue and birch. And one day in the week seemed to give ample penance for all sins of the rest. It is surprising how easy it was in those days to repent. We had no long rebukes of conscience to contend with. A sin was forgotten in its successors, almost as soon as committed, and accumulated offences did not seem to add materially to the burdens of conscience. Happy days of childhood, which really know nothing of the nakedness which a whole life after is consumed in the endeavor to hide from other eyes. Beauclerk.—You are not half so indulgent, Father, to your flock, as you have been to yourself. Abbot.—My son, we learn the right way, because we have once stumbled into the wrong one. It were sorry wisdom, with me, having seen the error of my own ways, to wink at yours. I am too faithfully the father of my flock to suffer you to run wild in your indulgencies. My policy is to economize your passions, by their seasonable restraint. This checks their excessive growth, which would only be to their own cost and peril, and your suffering. I thus keep your minds and modes in perfect balance, and, by due restraint of the animal tendencies—and all boyish tendencies are animal, when they are very decided— L maintain the superiority of the moral and intellectual nature. On this subject but too little is understood among us. Our affections, our sympathies and passions, receive too little training. We address ourselves wholly to the instruction of the head. The mind, the mind, the mind— receives all our care. We give too little to the heart—too little to the moods, the impulses, and those more exquisite sensibilities with which we are originally endowed, which are so many antennæ of the soul—delicate feelers of love, and reverence, and faith—without the due employment of which, we neither preserve our own better affections, nor give heed to those of our neighbor. There was much more in the old conventual custom of penance than we are apt to acknowledge. The mortification of the flesh is a prime requisite for maintaining a spiritual ascendancy and control over the more humiliating tendencies of the animal. I would not recommend the rod, the laceration of the limbs, the cruel self-torture of cord and steel. But simplicity of food, the total absence of stimulating drinks, the cold and solitary chamber, and temporary privation of books, music and conversation, are admirable means for subduing self-discord, for elevating and feeding thought, for schooling irregular and evil impulses, for framing the mind to devotional and better moods. In the training of children, let no worthy parent apprehend, through excess of tenderness, that privation will prove hurtful. It is surprising how litle nature craves. Satisfy the absolute wants of life—see that health suffers nothing— and the food cannot well be too poor, the clothing too thin, the indulgencies too few, the tasks too many. There must be a time for rest and for sport: but work and denial are perhaps more necessary to strength, health, happiness and virtue, in the case of childhood, than all your gifts. Wonderful, indeed, to see how a proper degree of privation and toil expands the frame, enlarges the limbs, elevates the soul, informs the mind. Our error is, that nothing of this kind is now permitted. Our sons have no training. They are neither worked nor whipped, and without the burdens of the one, and the chastenings of the other, they are not likely to arrive at perfect manhood. Editor.—You do not seem, Father to confide much to moral suasion Abbot.—Moral fiddlestick! If you could confine the pupil to one exclusive community, which was not only pure in its morals, but perfect in its wisdom,—moral suasion would be a thing of course. But do not undersand me as arguing in behalf of harsh treatment and violence, as absolutely necessary in subduing a stubborn nature. I prefer privation; the denial of those things upon which the boy has set his heart. I insist upon seclusion, cold food, sparingly given, cold water,—and if the urchin be very fat, a hair shirt. But I contend that he must be made to obey. That is the inevitable necessity, and if the privation, and the starvation, and the hair shirt, will not bring him to his senses, then clothe him with birch as with a garment. L2 Beauclerk.—You were certainly born for your office, Father. You were born to be a disciplinarian—a monk of the Ascetic School—a— Abbot.—Avaunt thee, pagan! This is the gratitude for all my indulgence. For this have I suffered thee to take champagne with me upon the beach, to the great consternation of the rigidly righteous. Beauclerk.—But a single bottle, Father! Abbot.—The allowance was small, I grant ye, but in full proportion to your merits. Still, you are half right, with all your impertinence. I have often fancied that the mode of life pursued by those old Monks would be the very sort of life for me;—the life of contemplation rather than of action. I envy the luxuries of their long life repose, in the embrace of a thought that never lacked its ideal. I frequently catch myself thinking and dreaming of the pleasant in their lives— their secluded cells—their brooding devotions— their sublime and spiritualizing fancies. I imagine to myself the venerable abbey on the hillside, or in the hollow, or over-grown with ivy, the drowsy porter at the gates, and the aged sacristian among the tombs, spelling out the inscription, the self-chidden man prostrate before the altar, with muttered `miserere' deprecating the wrath of Heaven by humbling himself in the face of Earth. I seem to drink of the dim, religious light which streams through the groined and painted window, like some spiritual effusion rather than like ordinary sunlight; and crouching beside the gigantic column, whose capital is lost in the various tracery of the lofty roof, I feel myself annihilated in the immense space which there seems pregnant with Deity. The very idea of such security, expands the soul. The exclusion of daily cares, of crowding man, of ordinary hopes and yearnings, brings us visibly and momentarily nigher to Heaven. In proportion as we shut out the struggles of our fellows, and their communion, the soul feels the necessity of turning to some influence by which its solitude can be peopled. And thought peoples the solitude always with the spiritual. To the good man confident in virtue, the forms which gather about the hermit, are fresh from the crystal hills of Paradise; the murmurs which musically fill his ears, are echoes from the thousand stringed harp that sounds ever at the portals of Heaven; and how subdued become his passions, and how sweet his fancies, and how full of strength and richness are his thoughts. If he trembles or falls— if he is hurt or apprehensive—it is because his struggle is like that of Jacob in the valley of Penuel—a struggle with an angel in which he prevails at last—in the very failure of which he is endowed with the strength of Princes. The great benefit of solitude is in the self-communion which it brings. God is always a party where man communes with himself. Whispers salute the mortal ear which mortal tongue offends not. High counsels informs the spirit in its solitude. Self studies alone unveil the strength as well as the weaknesses of the inquirer. Man can only know himself in this fashion, through this medium, under L3 the sacred influences of solitude. It is the error and the misfortune of our world and day, that we all of us live too much abroad. We have no homes. There are no places sacred to the thought and self-communion. We deliver ourselves to the multitude. We ask them to examine us. We dwell out of doors. Our thoughts are uttered for the press; our virtues for show. “The world is too much with us;” and, in its communion, we utterly forget our own. No man knows what an empire he has—how well peopled—how rich in all sort of possessions—all in his own soul. What pregnant fancies that are never let to fly; what abundant resources which are never put to interest; what ingenuity that is never made to spin or weave; what art that is never suffered to build or to create. And, thus endowed, we travel to the mart, and in the monotonous under song of our neighbor, we grow blind and deaf to the exquisite musical keys which lie open and yearning for the appointed pressure of our own fingers. We lack courage for our own world, and rely too much upon that over which we can seldom acquire any, or only a very brief control. Editor.—And singing for one's neighbor, one is constantly called upon to stoop, to make concessions which mock the truth of the soul, and all the pride of the sensibilities. Abbot.—As Byron said of the Laureate's song of homage—“which dare not aught prolong,” save the “Eulogy” of his sovereign. The servile desire to please simply, is as little consistent with the vocation of the Poet, as with that of the Prophet or the Priest. His mission is a nobler one. He is himself a Prophet. He is decreed to be a leader—a guide—a discoverer. He does not, and must not, confine himself to the language of the pesent, since his special duty is the future. He cannot hope for the love of his generation, since he is sent only for that succeeding. The genius that lowers his standard to the time, cannot survive his time, for the sufficient reason that the time itself is not stationary. The age hurries on with sensible rapidity. We are daily making new blazes in new forests. The old land-marks are abandoned—swept away in the fast rushing floods of an enlarging civilization. To plant his banner in advance of this mighty coming—to hew out the first path-way—to say, “in this route shalt thou travel, and upon mountains and oceans yet unseen, but which, from my eminence, are visible to me, shalt thou fix thy future eyes”—this has always been the business of the prophetic genius— the master spirit of the time. Editor.—Could we be persuaded of the truth of this, Father, and enter the solitude, in search of thought, at the frequent and needful season! Abbot.—We are not quite ripe for it, my son. We are in the enjoyment of the first gush, of an unexpected power. The great mass is rushing on, eager in acquisitions which another age will abandon as worthless. Some master spirits may behold this even now—may see the coming discoveries—may look out upon the Canaan which their own footsteps may never tread. In the literature of the age, we may possibly even now, L4 read dim prophecies of this future. No age is left utterly unattended to by its seers. They share the usual fate of those who tell imperfect or unwelcome truths. Like her Troy, “blasted by Phœbus with prophetic fire,” they win no faith from those upon whom they bestow the very secrets of the deity. Vainly they cry from their solitudes. The voice is lost in the storming of the billows, that rock to and fro in the struggle of the highway, wave succeeding wave, and crest after crest swept forward in the continual flow of the capricious waters. Happy he who goes aside from this multitude—who can detach himself from the mass, and, in the independence of the forest, appeal to his own individual nature and bring the internal man out of the depths and retreats of his own heart. Less happy, but far happier he, than the million whom he leaves. He will gather none of their spoils but he will grow richer in the knowledge of his own. He will not flourish in their eyes, but he will be conscious of himself—which they are not. He will live. Every emotion will have its proper utterance— the hope its fruition, the fancy its flowers, the imagination its wing—the man will know his God feel himself made after his glorious image. Editor.—Alas, Father! the great difficulty seems to be in determining one's status. What is our rank; what is our trust; the duty specially confided to our hands? Abbot.—It is the study of a life, my son; and the end of it may leave us still in doubt whether we have pursued the true vocation. But there can be no doubt that the search is still decreed. Know thyself! Ascertain thy use, and work according to what thou knowest, and according to the strength that is in thy sinews. We may work as thoroughly in repose as in action. Some men are made for action, others take a humbler place in the business of human performance. But they work together, though they work apart. Here is a new truth—the world has got possession of it—no matter how. It prefers not to ask who discovered it, least its gratitude may be taxed. It would be easy, perhaps, to show whence, by whose researches, and how long it lay imploring man to behold, before he deigned to set his eyes upon it. But, once found, and seen, the truth is set in motion. It is to perform. It has a working destiny before it; for every new truth is God's agent, for a time, or for all times, in the proper training of the race. It is delivered to us only when the race is prepared for its reception. For its transmission certain fiery spirits are employed, who carry it aloft above the crowd, but in their sight, as one carries a torch, which, thus lifted high, the winds cannot extinguish. These men go by various names. In one land they are called Moseses, in another Mahomets, in a third, Luthers, and so on—every land being in some degree provided with its working spirit according to its progress and its necessity. Glorious they are and great, and needful—but, behind these, and quite out of sight, are the greater but more shadowy forms, by whom the torch was first enkindled—the sacred fire preserved in secret places—and finally given into the hands of these fiery-working spirits. These were the men who wrought in solitude—who communed with God in the wilderness—who went up to the struggle, in the solitary mountains, while the million strove together with loud cries below, and wasted life in vain tumults, whether of danger or delight. The world is thus made up. There are many classes, it is true, but these need not all be considered. Two of them stand apart, which are the true mental leaders. The one finds the truth, the other carries it forward. The one sees the present deity, the other lifts his image before the multitude. Contemplation is the life of the one—action of the other. Of these, the last is the true offspring of the first. No child was ever born more legitimate. But they frequently come in conflict—sire and offspring. The genius which conceives the truth passes on to other discoveries. The true worker never rests. The seeker is never satisfied with the found,—for the forms of truth are infinite, and the tasks of search are strictly set for each succeeding generation. It happens that, while the discoverer toils in new developments, he comes in conflict with the zealot whom he has himself employed to carry forward the preceding. A blind worker is the latter, if a strong. It is perhaps well that he should be so, else where would he procure his courage—where find that confidence in his mission which makes him hurry in its prosecution, though he sees and feels that his goal must be the stake. It is this faith in the light that he carries before men's eyes that makes him war against other lights. Error, he knows, has its lights also —shining and burning lights for a season—comet-like effulgences that show a glorious train which satisfies myriads of gazers who ask not after the body from which it is supposed to flow. Natural it is that the should war with every light but his own. Thus comes the conflict even between the professors of truth itself. They do not see that all human truth is partial—that it is the divine truth alone which is perfect. They cannot be taught that the several fragments which they bear are capable of union—that they are parts of each other, and all parts of the perfect form after which the successive races are destined to struggle. It is only in the new revelations that they give up their issues upon the old. It is only in the broader blaze of a yet more perfect light, which absorbs all the scattered gleams which have preceded it, that they discover how frequently, in their zeal for the truth, they have labored in deadly hostility against the true. Bonhommie.—Your segar is out, Father. Abbot.—No more. I am for a siesta. Pray, brother, waken me when I have slept seven minutes. The siesta never sheuld exceed ten. We take supper on Prospect Hill to-night.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">XIV. Beauclerk.—You have heard, boys. We have but seven minutes. The old man will probably take ten for his siesta. We have no time to lose. I am for the other bottle. Bonhommie.—The motion is a good one. Is it the Champagne or the Perry that you prefer?— There is a bottle of each upon the table. Beauclerk.—The Perry is good, brother, but it has not the virtue of the Champagne. We will keep it in reserve, until our tastes become less nice. Allow me, and you shall see how I shall persuade that cork out of coventry. Ha! smack! —With what a burst of delight it bounds for the ceiling, like a noisy boy just let out from school. Let it play. It shall never again be put in bonds by us. A good creature is Champagne.—Ha! my Bard of the Isles—you do not drink! What's the matter? Poet.—I am troubled. Our venerable Father seems sad. Beauclerk.—Pshaw! only sleepy! He took too many of the oysters. Poet.—No! He was sad before dinner. Something touches him. His conversations, of late, seem to me to lack their customary buoyancy.— They sound in my ears like melancholy notes of warning. Beauclerk.—Pooh! pooh! That's because he preaches so much. He will neither be happy himself, nor suffer us to be so, In the language of Mose: “He won't give the b'hoys a chance!” I confess, I'm restive under his asceticism, and I am not the only one of the fraternity. The truth is, the Abbot gets old apace. He is on the decline, and the sooner we let him know that we have found a proper successor the better. Bonhommie.—Brother Beauclerk, how can you dream of such a thing? Poet.—Monstrous! Talk of decline; talk of deposing our venerable Father; talk of his asceticism; his severity; his restraints; when we all feel them to be our best securities. We enjoy, now, Brother Beauclerk, the right sort of freedom—that which, while it encourages pleasantry and happiness, is not inconsistent with propriety. It is the curse of most clubs that their freedom soon degenerates into mere license. This is not the case with us; yet we are permitted all social enjoyments. Beauclerk.—He has forbidden brag, vingt'un, poker, and other games, which I like. Pictor.—Those only which derive their chief interest from the gains which they yield. Games of mere chance are forbidden. He encourages whist, chess, billiards, backgammon, and many others. Beauclerk.—Yes, but only as moral exercises! Poet.—You know his philosophy on that subject. He approves of games, which exercise the thoughts of the mind, or the muscles of the body; which promote intellect and memory; agility, strength and grace. He only discountenances those which provoke dangerous appetites, and exercise selfishness and cunning. Talk of his age and asceticism, when it was only a week ago that he beat us all at goff. Beauclerk.—He has a sort of good humor, but it don't suit me exactly, and as for keeping us leashed as it were, denied to engage in the sports we desire, and forcing upon us those only which he approves, I frankly tell you, I don't relish it at all. The Abbot's a good man enough, but he's quite too much a puritan for me; and I tell you that's the opinion of more than half the fraternity. Pictor.—I don't believe a word of it. Beauclerk.—You'll see! He will have to give place to another. Poet.—Who! indeed! I'd like to see the brother of the fraternity bold enough to take the seat which he abdicates. His own consciousness of presumption will sink him through the chair. No! no! brother Beauclerk, these are damnable heresies which you utter, for which no penance can be too severe. Beauclerk.—You will find that I shall be absolved. He will walk, you'll see! I wouldn't give the old man pain, and we shall vote him a service of plate when he retires; but his day's done: he's passée. Your health, Bonhommie. Pictor, (aside)—'Tis the wine that speaks. Poet, (aside)—Not altogether. In vino veritas! Where there's so much smoke, there's some fire. Something's wrong. Beauclerk's got into bad company. He has been a little surly for some time past. But say nothing to the Abbot. Let our brother have time to feel his follies, by privately meditating them. Beauclerk.—What do you whisper? Come! glass all round. Brethren, don't suppose me hostile to the holy Father Abbot. I love the old cock: 'pon my soul I do! But I would spare his age the trouble of keeping in check such troublesome sparks as myself. Bonhommie.—What say you, my brothers for a siesta all round? I confess to a certain sort of drowsiness. Beauclerk.—Not a bit of it—not certainly till we finish the bottle. I'm for a song my boys. “'Twas a monkey that danc'd on the top,”— Eh! the Abbot! Enter Father Abbot. Abbot.—Continue your song, my son. Beauclerk.—Beshrew me, Father, if I can! Your sudden appearance has exorcised the spirit of song within me. Have you enjoyed your siesta? Abbot.—My seven minutes are eleven. Poet.—But you have not slept, Father? Abbot.—Yes, slept and dreamed; and such a dream! I dreampt my children that, all at once, all the teeth dropt out of my head. Beauclerk.—Hem! an omen! Poet.—In former days superstition had declared such a dream to be of the most fatal character; but now— Abbot.—Dreams are simply thoughts, my son; the exercises of an imagination without its usual restraints. I can account for this of mine. It is the result of a previous train of thinking, upon which, hitherto, I have said nothing to any of you. The loss of my teeth signifies the loss of my children. Omnes.—How, Father? Abbot.—It signifies that we are to separate. That the teeth fell out all at once, shows that the act which separates me from one, separates me from all. This can be only in two ways—by my death or withdrawal from the fraternity. But as the teeth fell out without let or hindrance, it is clear that the separation is my voluntary act. Now, as I certainly shall never commit suicide, it follows that I must leave you. This, my children, was the secret determination to which I had already come. Poet.—Impossible, Father! You surely will not leave us. Our shepherd— Beauclerk.—You have been our Father so long. Abbot.—Precisely! It is for this, among other reasons, that I feel bound to abdicate. There is a grace and propriety, my children, in not lingering unnecessarily upon the stage. Old men should learn to retire, and give way to their sons, before they become too old. We thus save ourselves from sneer and censure; we thus escape the exercise of one of the most ungracious sorts of tyranny. It is the misfortune that old men, accustomed to office, never know when to retire. They never reflect upon the hopes of youthful ambition, in whose way they stand. They are as little considerate of society, whose affairs they can no longer conduct with energy and skill, and seem not aware that they are kept in place rather by a deference which cannot forget the past, than in consequence of their admitted capacity to do the business of the present. I shall endeavor not to fall into this error, my children, and my determination was made only the week before we came to the Island, to make the conclusion of our visit here, the close of my administration. My dream forced the utterance of my secret from me. You will have to appoint my successor in your next regular chapter. In the interim, hearken to the disposition which will be made of your time. From the Island, we visit Cooper river for a day. The planters are now harvesting their crops, and the scene will be a grateful one. After that we proceed to a tour among the mountains of Georgia and our own State, the scheme of which will be submitted you to-morrow. You have heard my children. Beauclerk.—Eheu! Abbot.—Be not sad, my children. You tremble, my Bard! Dear young son of Apollo, wherefore should you tremble? Poet.—Alas, Father! “Cosi stupisce, e cade Pallido, e smorto in viso Al fulmine improvviso L'attonito pastor.”[2] [2] Thus stunn'd, and stupified, and deadly pale, Falls to the earth the Shepherd, as he hears, The sudden burst of thunder o'er his head. † But, as he finds how idle were his fears, He rises from the earth—he breathes once more, And seeks and numbers his fear-scattered flock. Abbot.—Ah, my son, you have your answer in the remaining verse of the same passage: M “Ma quando por s'avvede Del vano suo spavento, Sorge, respira e riede A numerar l'armento Disperso dal tumor.”† We always exaggerate our losses in the moment when they occur. With time, we feel the idleness of our fears. The scattered flock is soon recovered by a new Pastor. God never leaves any community without the Shepherd who can lead them to safe and pleasant pastures; always assuming that the sheep are not of that perverse breed which is properly decreed to the butcher. You will not miss your present father, my children, so much as he misses you; and, believe me, it is high time that you should make provision for the future. The fraternity has numerous brothers, most of whom are quite as well fitted as myself to serve you. They have seen my system. It is generally approved of. They will carry out my plans. You will enjoy society without formalities; leisure and luxury even, without license; sports and pleasure without excess; labor without exhaustation; and the flow of a various conversation, without dispute or controversy. We have studiously excluded from our order, all that class of spirits who lie in wait for disputation; who cavil at words; who are forever on the look out for flaws in your grammer or your argument; not so much with the view to correct your error, as to exercise their polemics. You will continue to exclude all such people from your haunts: all peevish, captious spirits; all triflers who never rise to the dignity of an earnest intelligence; who never respect the moods of a neighbor; and who find an excuse in the emission of a bad pun, for interrupting a fine philosophy. You will enjoy the creature comforts with like caution and moderation; assured of this, that excess always brings its own penalties, and that the pleasures of life, of whatever kind, are like sweetmeats, comfits, &amp;c.—very good things in their way, and at the proper season, but the worst things in the world upon which to make a meal; not only hurtful to the health, but to the appetite itself. But a truce to this, my children. These texts have been too often preached from before, to render necessary their repetition, even at the moment of parting. If, hereafter, you remember me, you will not easily forget my lessons. Let us now to other matters. I could wish, my dear Pictor, that you would seize upon that evening landscape. The view from this point, in the direction of the City, would make a lovely one on canvass. You look through a delicious avenue, the long stretch of shore, Haddrell and Mount Pleasant on the right, and the western extremity of the Island on the left, forming, as it were, a framework for the picture. The evening sun sheds a glorious halo over the City that seems to loom upwards to its embrace. Its darker features turned towards us, with the sunlight in the back M3 ground, affords all the effect of an exquisite and noble contrast; while those richly dyed and fantastic clouds, with edges of crimson and orange, hanging over it as the ample curtain of some imperial couch, render wholly unnecessary the relief which flat scenery so commonly seems to need in the absence of lofty wood crowned elevations. Here, in the foreground, the village of Moultrie comes out boldly and beautifully: a city seemingly itself, and seeming, indeed, at its western extremity, to unite with the more distant City. It is only by the bold outline and lively clearness of the one, and the faint, subdued and dimly shining aspects of the other, that you are led to suspect the interval that lies between them. The two steamers now sweeping over the space between, give you all that is needed for the vitality of the picture; which, beheld as we behold it now, and from this point of view, is as lovely a landscape as ever charmed the eye. It is not, indeed, the common painter who can do such a subject well. Bold outlines may be hit off by a very ordinary hand; but the delicacy, the sweetness, the soft tenderness and grace of this picture, require the nicest circumspection, the sweetest fancy, and the most elaborate finish. Such a subject would honor the pencil of Fraser. Pictor.—I have been sketching the very scene already, Father. I have seen it very much with your eyes. If permitted it shall appear in the gallery of the Abbey, at the next regular chapter. Abbot.—Ah! my son! This is what I love! The art which works, rather than talks—which performs rather than promises;—this is what is most needful among our social virtues. We are beginning to bestir ourselves my children. I feel that a new era has dawned upon our people. We can all of us report progress. Charleston has hitherto consisted, really of two communities, and these have been in deadly conflict for twenty years or more. The one community consisted of a people coerced by the necessities of life, devoted to toil and business, and bringing to their work the capital of fresh energies, eager hopes and sleepless enterprise. Their deficiencies chiefly lay in the respects of social tone. They had no acknowledged place in a society, which, peculiar at first, and forming one of the oldest communities in the country, had acquired a certain permanence of position;—was fixed and recognised;— and had, in various ways, reached a very high distinction. This distinction formed the capital of the other portion of the City. Its people could boast of a past. They could look back with pride to their ancestry, many of whom occupied an acknowledged and high place in our annals. They had been accustomed to wealth,—had all the advantages of social training and education, and could assert those graces of manner which require leisure and society as well as education and wealth. It is difficult to realize the charm and extent of these accomplishments, and we are thus too frequently led to over-rate their value. Certainly, there is nothing so grateful in society as exquisite manners—that nice delicacy of deportment, which never outrages a sensibility, which tempers earnestness M4 with grace, and seasons an attic wit with a politeness that takes all venom from the point. Now, to attain these graces of society, we are required to make some sacrifices; but our old community had made too many. The danger is always that, in the perfection of our tastes, we lose some of our necessary energies. The secret is to refine our manners without forfeiting our strength. This might always be effected, if a miserable vanity did not interpose equally to thwart natural events, and a just philosophy. The man of manners and refinements, is apt to make them especial objects of pride; and in doing so, emasculates his mental energies. He perpetually contrasts his quiet, graceful manner, with the rude hurry of the working man; and in proportion as the rough energy of the other offends his tastes, will he turn away equally disgusted with, or unobservant of, the vigor and power which are coupled with the roughness which offends him. In rejecting what is evil, or inferior, in the manners, he makes the mistake of rejecting also the virtues of that manhood which is the secret of safety in all communities. He learns to dispise labor and art, which are the two great conquering agencies of society and man; and, in the over appreciation of his own graces, he loses utterly the great virtues of his neighbor. The other, in turn, too often revenges himself on the society which rejects him, by disparaging the accomplishments which he had not allowed himself the leisure to acquire. He rushes to the other extreme of behaviour. He adopts a rude bearing and an abrupt manner. He studiously roughens his tone, and strips his deportment, as far as he may, of the exterior graces which convention has established as the means of softening the necessary attritions of society and business. You will have perceived, you who can remember, what a contrast in the behaviour of too many of our youth to what it was only twenty years ago. In the school which furnished our models, at that period, we were studiously taught to give way to age, to infancy, to woman, whether white or black. The concession was made to feebleness no less than dignity and distinction. We never hustled the crowd for place or position. If we entered the lobby of the theatre there was no struggle. Did we go to the post-office for letters, we waited our turn. It was no justification for thrusting our elbows into the ribs of our neighbor, that we were in a hurry. My neighhor's corns still demanded my respect, though I had business elsewhere. The truth was not then wholly forgotten, that the world was not made simply on our account. I see a great and melancholy change in this respect, which change I charge, in some degree, upon the recklessness of trade, and its too little regard for the requisitions of society. This demeanor is the more reprehensible, inasmuch as trade should especially cultivate the graces and needs not violate a single social propriety in order to success. Its energies need not be impaired, in any degree, by a careful regard to the suavitor in modo. Trade, which is the tributary of commerce, has only to take its character from its M5 superior. Commerce is, perhaps, the greatest of civilizers. It subdues war; it reconciles hostile nations; it appeals to art, and nourishes it with veneration; its representative have been the most noble of the princes of the earth. There could be no better teacher of what is at once manly in social energies, and lovely in social refinement. Denied social position, at the beginning of his career, the working man has only to wait patiently, and prosecute his toils, modestly and earnestly, with his proper lights and guides before him. Society demands an apprenticeship, as well as arts and sciences. At all events, no man must seek to revenge himself upon society for its seeming neglects, by abandoning his soul to Mammon. This is to sacrifice the substance for the shadow; the soul for the purse. Too many are apt to make this mistake, and to set up Plutus as the only true idol in society. The faith is a common one enough, but a false one. That society which mere money can command, is seldom worth having. The wise and the good must equally despise it. Yet a bad passion helps this vulgar faith, too frequently, into a strange activity. The disappointed and vain aspirant after position, feels that money brings him power; that, with money he can master men; that, in process of time, he will buy the homestead of the haughty aristocrat, who has too much scorned his pretensions; that he will become the master of those fair fields that have hitherto mocked his eyes at a distance; and that the sons, or grandsons, of his social rival, will yet be compelled to throng about the doors of his counting room, soliciting the patronage, and employment of the very person whom their sires could despise. This has been a common history among us. What with exclusiveness, and the enjoyment of the dolce far niente, the honored names of a past generation are greatly reduced in dignity and fortune. They thrive no longer; but the good omen is to be found in the fact that so many of their descendants are showing themselves willing to work. I have in my eye at this moment several noble youth, who are grappling with their duties with that hearty zeal and courage, which make the only true manhood—not dipping a little into business as a timid boy goes into the water, as if he dreadfully feared to wet his feet;—but plunging, head-foremost, fearless, as the bold swimmer who is resolved on wrestling fortune from the waves. When this shall become general in our community;—when society shall recognize the necessity of coupling manhood always with its refinements; not suffering taste to degenerate into fastidiousness, or good manners into feeblenees;—but honoring these only as they are tributary to manly performance;—and when, on the other hand, the performing and the business men, shall recognize the just claims of a social organization;—shall recognize what is due to good taste, social refinement, delicacy and propriety of manners; and all those arts which tutor the sensibilities, and civilize the rude humanity,—then shall the two branches of our society work together as they have not done before in my recollection.— Hitherto, there has been no communion between them. They have not only not worked together, but one portion has opposed to the other vis inertiæ, —denying itself almost wholly to a cause that was common to them both,—the maintenance and progress of the community. Now, we have a grateful prospect of better things. We are fast getting rid of our absurdities. We are beginning to see life in its just attributes. Necessity is doing its work, and vanity and pretention no longer fold their robes about them, looking with contempt upon that energy which impels the engine,—which drives the barge, and harnesses the very lightning to the cars of commerce and society. True manhood, now, is everywhere regarded as to be found only in performance; and the youth now-a-days, who is not willing to work cheerfully in his vocation, and according to his endowments, should be shorn of his beard, dressed up in petticoats, and set to brood with foolscap and bells to the end of his baby destiny. Editor.—The exclusiveness, Father, of which you have spoken on the part of a portion of our community, was, perhaps, in no respect more injurious than in the frequent family intermarriages. Abbot.—You are right, my son. Nothing so much tends to destroy the moral and the physical virtues of a race as a habit like this. The breeds must be crossed. It is surprising that, with the general conviction, so common among us, of this necessity in the case of animals, we should have disdained to acknowledge the importance of the rule in respect to man. In this connexion men are to be considered as animals also. No man should marry his cousin, of any remove; and it would be well if men always sought their wives in other Districts, or in other States. Insular and small communities, in particular, should always send their young men abroad to wive. Failing in this, their children must necessarily be of a puny and inferior physique, will be of inferior intellectual endowment; in repeated cases, will become idiots, and finally will cease to breed at all. Family intermarriages in our country, are too frequently devised for the maintenance of that exclusiveness which family pride too much regards as its only security. It is thus that we seek to supply the guaranties of distinctions which, in aristocratic governments, are afforded by titles of nobility. The better specimens of the European nobility, are almost invariably the fruit of a cross; the nobleman seeking alliance with the commoner. The motive with the British nobility for such alliances, is that wealth which the heir to a great house requires to sustain his dignity. The result is the perfection of physical manhood. The British aristocracy are probably the finest looking set of men in the world; exhibiting an organization of form and feature which has never been surpassed. The effect upon their character has been equally admirable. You would be surprised to see the number of these young scions of nobility who traverse the world in all sorts of exploring enterprises. Now you find them in the East, on the back of a dromedary, coasting the desert, and sleeping in tents, among the most lawless tribes of the country. You remember the exquisite picture painted by Lord Byron, in his “Dream;” “He lay— Reposing from the noontide sultriness, Crouch'd among fallen columns, &amp;c.” The picture is common to the English nobleman. Anon, you find them, ranging over the plains and prairies of our Northwest, pursuing the buffalo and the grisly bear. No hardships discourage, no dangers affright them; and they combine admirably the virtues of a bold, impulsive manhood, with the best breeding of a social aristocracy. We must protect our family dignities by other virtues than those of exclusiveness, my children—by performance, by achievement, by deeds, by enterprise, energy, perseverance—the very virtues which originally conferred distinction upon, and planted pride within the bosom of the founder of the family. Many, if not most of the leading names in Carolina were merchants, tradesmen and mechanics. There are few, however haughty, who, travelling backward a few generations, would not stumble over the family heir-loom in the shape of an axe, an anvil, a jack plane, or an anchor. Let us teach the true pride to our sons which should make them honor forever, and prize, with a sort of reverence, the implements by which their fathers acquired fortunes for their children, who have not always preserved, or prized properly, the tools by which they did so. He who feels shame to be reminded of the craft of his ancestor, deserves none of the profits which followed from its exercise. What I should like to teach in particular is—that nobility lies wholly in noble performance; that without performance, there is no manhood, and that, while occupations differ in degree, quality or profit, he is to be esteemed as a man, and he only, who, having ascertained what he is good for, goes to his task; not merely beneath the goad of necessity, for that betrays the base nature of the slave; but as one eager for the duty which is assigned him, and anxious to make himself distinguished in his vocation: and every vocation may have its distinctions, if those only attempt it who are equal to its tasks. Editor.—Were these the common principles— the general sentiments, Father, what a glorious community we should have. What a splendid spectacle is that of a great city, all parties working together in the common cause; all eager, hopeful, cheerful, industrious—proud only in emulation, and thoughtful chiefly of the means of multiplying the common resources and the common securities. Abbot.—Do you remember Milton's picture, my son, in the “Areopagitica?” “Behold now this vast city; a city of refuge, the mansion-house of liberty, encompassed and surrounded with his protection. The shop of war hath not there more anvils and hammers waking, to fashion out the plates and instruments of armed justice in defence of beleaguered truth, than there be pens and heads there, sitting at their studious lamps, musing, searching, revolving new notions and ideas where-with to present, as with their homage and their fealty, the approaching reformation. Others as fast reading, trying all things, assenting to the force of reason and convincement. What could a man require more from a nation so pliant and so prone to seek after knowledge? What wants there to such a towardly and pregnant soil, but wise and faithful laborers, to make a knowing people a nation of prophets, of sages, and of worthies? We reckon more than five months yet to harvest; there need not be five weeks, had we but eyes to lift up. The fields are white already.” There is another passage of this noble sort of eloquence near this, in the same treatise. Editor.—I remember. “Methinks, I see in mind a noble and puissant nation, rousing herself like a strong man after sleep and shaking her invincible locks, &amp;c.” Abbot.—Let us now stroll upon the beach, and gazing upon the distant city in the evening sunlight, our Poet shall declaim for us Milton's description of Athens. Editor.—The motion is a good one. The evening speaks to us very seductively, and Brother Bonhommie talks of a late supper—an intimation with a significance quite as great as that of Lucullus, when he ordered his supper in the Apollo chamber. Beauclerk—(aside to Pictor)—I am afraid the old man heard me. I am monstrously ashamed. Pictor—(aside to B.)—No! I think not. I am sure not. Beauclerk.—Yet he spoke of the very subject. Pictor.—Which he would not have done had he heard you. Be at ease, and repent of your error with what speed you may.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">XV. Editor.—You were interrupted, Father, while speaking of the projected Hotel upon the Island. You spoke of your prevision in regard to it. We are now upon the western edge of the Curlew Ground, where it seems to me, the best site could be found for such an establishment. Abbot.—It is the very spot that has been chosen, my son—that will be chosen, I should say.— I am speaking now of that which is yet in the womb of the future. Eight acres have been selected at this point, which are ample for this purpose; and I rejoice to say, that the subscriptions made already, realize the estimated amount of the expenditure for such an establishment. Our men of substance have come out manfully, and more than twenty-two thousand dollars have been raised for the purpose. Doubtless, ten thousand more could be easily procured, but the proprietors will content themselves with five thousand. Editor.—With such an amount we should have a very splendid building. Abbot.—I have already seen the design, my son, and it will suit in all respects the object. It will constitute an imposing and beautiful edifice, rising gracefully upon the spectator coming in from the sea. The style of the fabric will be at once simple and showy, somewhat after the style of architecture at Oran. You shall have a sketch of it here upon the sand. You see what a noble colonnade is before you, covering both stories of the building, from roof to basement, and extending the extreme length of the structure, which is full three hundred and fifty feet. The projection in the centre will be nearly, perhaps quite, an hundred feet. It will thus relieve the uniformity of a range so extensive. The dome-like elevation from the roof, corresponding happily with the general style of the building, contributes also to the general relief, and constitutes one of the most grateful features in the plan. Here my son, is a glorious promenade, from which you may drink in the breezes from all quarters of the compass, range with unimpeded vision from East to West, from North to South, and shift the scene at pleasure, from sea to land, from shore to forest, from bright, flashing and rolling breaker, to the harmonious tints of green umbrageous wood, and bright, and flower-garnished thicket. With the aid of glasses of sufficient power, you will be allowed to look upon the bathers at Cape May, and, by a twist of the same instrument, you may see the toilsome workers after the picturesque, as they shout from the top of the Stone Mountain to the fair damsels who are content to look up from below. I hold it, my son, not impossible to realize all these prospects from our Island Belfry, always assuming the powers of the telescope, and the imagination of the gazer, to be equal to so magnificent a survey. For persons of moderate fancy, a view of the harbor will be sufficiently compensative. I need scarcely call your attention to the scene immediately before us. Its exquisite grace and beauty are unquestionable. I see that Sir Charles Lyell has recently been pleased to acknowledge it. He is a man of taste and decency, as well as a Geologist. Certainly, so far as nature is concerned, no son of Carolina need go out of Charleston harbor for a noble ocean prospect. In regard to the coup d'æil, she ranks very near NewYork,—lacking, it is admitted, the immense vivacity, which results to the latter, from the crowding cities and villas, which, upon the two great rivers at Manhattan, sit picturequely placed in equal beauty and animation. But, the Bay of Charleston, almost immediately upon the sea,— the waters of the great deep rolling into the doors of her habitations—she springing, sudden, like another Venice, from their embrace—her broad and graceful rivers Ashley and Cooper (Keawah and Etiwan) clasping her, with murmurs of affection, in their arms, ere they pass away to the gulf in which they are swallowed up and lost—the green stripes of shore that stretch away on either hand, and, sloping off to the sea, contrast exquisitely with the silver of its glancing billows—the grey islets that lie between these and the ocean,— the fortresses that crown the whole with imposing moral associations—the queenly city in the midst,— the deep, dark, foliage in the back ground,—these are all, in such beautiful relationship,—in themselves how beautiful—that it needs nothing but a becoming faith in themselves, and in the material possessed by our native artists, to furnish them with a thousand scenes of loveliness and grace, such as Doughty has made to live for ever upon the canvass. N Editor.—You are quite right, Father, in the appreciation of the prospect. I feel that I have undervalued it until now. Abbot.—So have we all, my son. I contend that our entire Low Country, resourceless as it hath hitherto appeared to the vulgar sightseeker, up to the first steppes of the mountain region, is abundantly provided with characteristics, peculiar to itself, of grace, animation and beauty, without the advantage of a single mountain. But it is for the painter of detail, rather than of outline, to distinguish and relieve it from the cumbrous masses of the forest, and the unimposing uniformity of place. In other words, it must be the student of scenery, and not the mere sightseeker, to delineate such portraits. We have had, we have now, living artists, to whom the discovery of these beauties would be easy. Let me not forget in this connection, the happy talent of one who is no longer with us. Trouche was the very painter for such scenes. The swamp and forest scenery of the lower country, had infused itself into his very nature. He dreamed it, and he painted accordingly. He has left too many pictures unpainted: called away too soon, himself young, and young in all the impulse of his art. Had Touche found a patron, twenty years ago, in some liberal man of fortune, had he been put to a stern apprenticeship of taste and genius, how would he have honored his patron—how done honor to his country! He was undoubtedly a man of genius, whom we did not sufficiently honor. Editor.—Do you know, Father, that there is still extant a small collection of cabinet sketches by Coram—Views on Ashley and Cooper Rivers, most of them mere outlines—studies for future use, rather than pictures, which prove the susceptibilities of these views? Abbot.—I have seen them. In the hands of a painter of talent these sketches, even now, might be elaborated with the most admirable effect. I wish that we could persuade Fraser to address his pencil to materials so easy of access, so grateful to the genius loci, and so worthy of his grace and exquisite finish. By the way, my son, you should see two beautiful things, recently from his easel, entitled “Still” and “Running Water.” They are the sweetest things I have seen for many a day. I confess to lusting after them. When I think of them I violate the commandment. But let us descend from our imaginary perch to the ground floor of our Hotel. Having past through the front colonnade the building opens in the centre into an ample hall. This, in turn, opens upon a ball-room on either side, the dimensions of each of which are one hundred and ten by thirty feet. These ball rooms may be united with the hall, making the grandest of all saloons for state occasions—the arrival of emigrant Princes, Ex-Presidents, or a visit from the entire order of the “Monks of the Moon.” I have great pleasure in informing you that I am already in receipt of a communication from the proprietors of the Hotel, which advises me that an apartment shall always be held in reserve for the fraternity, and that the freedom of the establishment shall be N2 accorded to the Father Abbot, the only condition annexed to his privileges being the performance, at proper seasons, of the duty of the Chaplain. After this, I need not pass any eulogies upon the taste, the good sense, or the liberality of these excellent gentlemen. They have an eye to merit; they know what is due to literature and the fine arts. They feel, with a proper sense, that they have in hand a work which appeals to the higher graces of society; that they are providing, in fact, for the elite of the South—its wealth, beauty, fashion and intellect. In this connection, I may add, that a very civil request has been made, through me, to our brethren, that they will prepare a series of studies, from Southern History and tradition, for original tableaux vivants. They are properly sick of the stale repetitions of Dukes and Marquisses; Macbeths and Hamlets; Queens and Shepherdesses; Turks and Banditti. I have already considered the subject, and have designed more than one hundred studies, from Carolina history alone, each of which, in a dramatic representation, would bring down all the thunders of the house. In this Hotel, the tableaux can be arranged, privately, in either of the ball rooms, the spectators occupying the hall. Editor.—Verily, Father, our proprietors design the thing handsomely. They have wondrously risen in my esteem. Abbot.—And with reason. But to proceed. Back of the hall is the office of the Hotel, occupying a recess which opens upon the piazza in the rear, and which, on three sides, is surrounded by a spacious court. On the extreme right of the front, is a spacious parlor for the ladies, in the rear of which, occupying one hundred, by thirty-eight or forty feet of the eastern wing of the building, is the Dining Saloon—a hall large enough for a hecatomb. I have not before told you of these wings; which are spacious buildings in themselves. They stretch from either end of the main building, one hundred and twenty feet, the colonnade covering them in like manner with the front, and connected with it. In the rear of the dining room is a pantry, to which the fraternity is to have a pass key. The inner area of the building is sheltered by its piazzas extending its entire surface. The chambers number one hundred and five, and are no miserable little closets, such as serve painfully to remind a man of the narrow limits of that last chamber which he needs; but are such as the climate requires—ample, cool, well ventilated and sheltered by be colonnade from the direct entrance of the sun. The beds are all on springs, elastic always, and, therefore, cool; and West Indian Hammocks, of strongly plainted cane, it is suggested will still afford to the sleeper the choice of swinging, or simply rolling himself into the embrace of Morpheus. A grand passage divides the double ranges of rooms, by passing through the centre of the building its entire length. From the Eastern wing of the building extends a covered way which conducts you to the Bathing Hall. This is designed to be sufficiently large to accommodate Diana and all her Nymphs. Here, Douches and Shower Baths, N3 ropes pendant, swings, and other agencies, borrowed from the Gymnasium, are to be furnished, enabling the virgin beauty to frolic through Summer hour, in the two-fold embraces of sea and air. Hither, no miserable Actæon can penetrate; no Arcadian Damon pop into sight, unadvisedly, to apostrophize his unconscious mistress on the scantiness of her wardrobe. Here, all is to be lulling security and sweetness; a delicious retreat and shelter, soft and dreamy, as any furnished by Thompson, in the castle and domain of Indolence. Editor.—'Pon my soul, Father the prospect is a delicious one. Abbot.—You may well say so; but this is not all. Our excellent proprietors know well, how much the virtues of society depend upon its amusements. They know, that where we fail to provide the young with innocent amusements, the devil will take precious good care to see that they have others of his own choosing. They know that nature craves and will have amusement, whether as a relief from labor, a physical exercise, or the satisfaction of mental curiosity. They have, accordingly, allotted apartments in this same neighborhood, to a Bowling Saloon, and Billiards. Here, then when the lady has had her cue, and exercised herself as much as she desires,— she disappears amid the placid waters, and is nerved and strengthened for new trials of skill, by their refreshing embraces. Here, pleasure ministers to proper exercise; to purification, purification to repose; repose to health; and a joyous re-appearance with the morrow's sunshine, on the part of the damsel, brings the moral and the physical world together in the happiest unison. As Chaucer writes it—showing the coincidence between Light and Beauty— “Uprose the sun, and uprose Emily.” Editor.—Our conference, Father, was interrupted on a previous occasion, when we were discussing the proper name to be given to such a Hotel. In your absence, the Brethren continued the subject. Beauclerk proposed, “The Island House;” Bonhommie, the “Rutledge House;” Benison, the “Summer Retreat;” Beauregard, the “Marion” or “Moultrie,” “Gadsden” or “Pinckney.” Abbot.—And you? Editor.—I was divided between Rutledge and Moultrie, but remembering what you had said, on the subject of the inappropriateness of the names, I forbore. Abbot.—And, our Poet? Editor.—He said nothing. Abbot.—Ah! he could feel this unfitness. His veneration never allows him to vulgarise, by too much frequency, the thing he honors. I am afraid that our opinions will have but little avail, since it is whispered that the child is already christened “Moultrie.” I confess that I am sorry for this. It is our infirmity here, that we ring the changes quite too frequently upon a favourite name. Here, now, is Fort Moultrie, the Village is Moultrie, N5 and the Hotel is to be called “Moultrie.” Nobody honors Moultrie's worth and public services more than I do; but I cannot see the propriety of these iterations. Moultrie's great distinction was the defence of the Fortress which properly bears his name. I should have been content with this. Certainly, however, when the village received the same name, it should have been enough. If the defence of the Fort still demanded such expressions of gratitude, something surely was due to Rutledge, by whose orders, by whose determined will, the Fort was defended, even in spite of the commanding general, Charles Lee, who insisted that it should be given up. “I will cut off my right arm,” said Rutledge, “before I will write such an order!” But we scarcely honor a great man, by christening a hotel after him. If hotels are to be named after persons, I should prefer to honor thus, some individual who had distinguished himself in the cuisine. The inventor of a famous sauce might thus be honored. Monsieur Ude, for example, or Hannah Glass, would be proper claimants for selection. Certainly, the objects of the house, should be considered in its designation— Moultrie, Marion, Sumter—are all good names for ships of war and fortresses. Let us keep them for these higher purposes. Let us not degrade them by making them unnecessarily frequent. You remember the peasant, who gave as a reason for voting Aristides into banishment, that he was tired of continually being reminded of the justice of that citizen. We, of the low country, have been offending our interior by continually insisting upon our favorites. They are the capital of which we boast to others, however much we may neglect their claims at home. It has grown to be a proverb in the interior—“It is only a Charleston affair.” Let us not offend any prejudices, unless, by so doing, we can cure them; but this was never recognized as the proper process. Now, regarding the objects of the Hotel—its situation, the peculiarities of the scene, and the latent purposes had in view by the proprietors, I should have studiously rejected the names of persons in this choice. Here is an establishment beside the sea—it is the only great ocean summering place from Cape May to the Mississippi; it is really the great ocean refuge of the South, a central point from the Chesapeake to the Gulf, as healthy as any place in the world; very beautiful to the eye; very grateful to the physique; a point easy of approach, by railroad and steamer, from every quarter in the South —the ocean point, par excellence, along a thousand miles of coast! This is the idea to keep in view while naming the Hotel. Thousands of the people of the interior who will naturally seek such a retreat in summer, have never beheld the ocean.— The idea of its vast wilderness of wave is to them as vague and imposing as to a low countryman the idea of a mountain country. They seek it as an ocean retreat, and so I would have named the Hotel. Our Poet, in his poem, descriptive of the scene, speaking of the village, seems to me to have hit upon a phrase which would have better suited than any other, at once novel, euphonious and highly significant—the “Ocean Hamlet; or “Ocean House,” or “Ocean Retreat,” should have been the name; and names are things. They fall upon the ear with a force to which we do not yield sufficient credit. The ear will tire of a too frequent name; while the force of an appropriate and grateful name will be suggestive of fancies which work upon the mind with all the strength of an affection. But enough. I would have had it otherwise. Editor.—It is evident, Father, that you attach considerable importance to this establishment.— You regard it for its effects, apart from its obvious uses? Abbot.—It is something gained. It is one more step to our emancipation. It is a gain upon our former condition. It will do something towards curing us of that self-disparaging weakness, that of absenteeism. It is the infirmity of a provincial people that they have no faith in home. Let us prove that even the follies and fancies of home, can have their charm quite as well as those of other people. But the Hotel proves something more. You remember what is said of that Saint, I forget which, who, when his head was off, walked with it for half a mile under his arm. To prove that he only took the first three steps, in this condition, is sufficient for my faith. I require you to prove nothing more. Now, when you show me Carolina going into her own manufactures, sending her own ships upon the sea, and providing for her own people home places for refuge, you show me the first three steps taken towards an indefinite progress; and I care nothing then whether she carries her head under her arm or upon her shoulders. I feel that she must go ahead, at all events. The progress is begun. The apathy is at an end. There is no more stagnation; and even a thunder storm may be considered grateful, as it relieves the atmosphere, and shows the presence of a real and active principle of life. Our ships now move daily over the waters. Our harbors resound with the volumes of escaping steam. Never was there more competition for our trade. And our steam shuttles begin to make such a music, as guarantees us against “a little more folding of the hands to slumber.” Be sure that other sounds and signs will follow, significant equally of pleasure and business. This little bridge uniting Haddrell and the Island must be built. Our country friends from Columbia, Camden, Augusta and Greenville, will demand it. You have no ideas of the beauties of the country to which it will conduct—leading you to the banks of the Wando, and affording a thousand pleasant rambles and retreats to the summer idler. You will probably have a railway from this very Hotel to Mount Pleasant, where it looks down from its yellow hills upon the City, and where I hope soon to see more than one Cotton Factory in full blast. All these points and headlands, these islets and promontories, will become, as I have said before, gay and lovely hamlets adorning the harbor. We will pass from point to point—from river to river, and I feel sure that you will see among other improvements, a noble bridge spanning the broad Ashley itself, and uniting the Neck to St. Andrew's Parish—the very region which should be covered with smiling farms and marked by the most productive tillage. Editor.—A bridge across the Ashley, Father? Abbot.—And why not? Editor.—One would suppose, Father, that the unsatisfactory result of the first, and most expensive experiment, would suffice to discourage all further enterprises of this sort. Abbot.—Really, I see not why it should. A bridge was built, and blown away, in one of the most destructive gales that was ever witnessed.— Should that discourage from future efforts? We know that ships, by the hundreds, are annually lost at sea, in squall and tempest. But who acknowledges this as a sufficient reason to forego the future building of merchantmen and men of war? Hurricanes and tornadoes have swept the very bed of Ashley river and the harbor to the bottom. One of peculiar terror and power is recorded by our early historians. It laid the ocean bare to its secret gulfs, and many noble ships were torn from their anchorage, and scattered in wreck and fragment along the shores. But what merchant ever dreams of avoiding the usually safe harborage of the bay of Charleston? There is nothing in the objection to a new bridge over the Ashley, because of the destruction of the old one. But the old bridge deserves no mention for another reason. It was a miserable trap-stick affair, badly conceived and badly built. I have it from old inhabitants, that it swayed perceptibly with the waves, even before it was torn up by the tempest. The piles were never driven below the mud. Modern science, and improved experience, would not be content with such an apology for a bridge. We should now drive our piles, shod with iron for the purpose, deep down into the marl itself, which forms the rocky and fast bed of the river. You have seen, the newly invented machine for driving piles, worked by steam, which is even now employed upon the causeway of the bridge, in repairing it? The ranging timber, sticks forty feet in length, and of corresponding thickness, are grasped by the iron antennæ of the instrument, are whirled aloft, without effort, and are driven down by a relentless stroke from a mall weighing eighteen hundred pounds. The shaft must go down— must bury itself in the marl—or must be shivered into splinters. It cannot help but take steadfast root in the rocky basin, and the tempest that tears it up must tear up the very bed of the river. Editor.—But such a bridge, Father, must be very expensive. Where is the money to come from? Abbot.—Not so expensive as you may imagine. I understand that there are enterprising and ingenius architects prepared already to undertake the work: prepared to contract for its full performance, at a cost not exceeding sixty thousand dollars. Editor.—Can this be possible? Abbot.—It is true! You will scarcely ask where such a sum is to be found. I can tell you, my son, that the money is ready for the work, and can be forthwith coming, in three weeks, if necessary. It needs but the movement; nothing more than the first step made in the business, and the performance follows. And it should have been done long ago. The old bridge, if am rightly instructed, worthless as it was, cost at least one hundred and twenty thousand dollars, raised almost in the infancy of our commerce. What ought we to do now, when our harbor is crowded with new and splendid sea steamers from every great port in the Union. When an immense line of railways, brings us to the trade of a measureless interior; and when a noble enterprise is already planning that which is necessary to the full success of our efforts—a direct steam intercourse with the great maritime cities of Europe? My son, the City of Charleston should link herself directly with every neighborhood, which can be made tributary to the farmer and the grazier. This country, south of us in particular, is admirably endowed with rich soils and a most fructifying climate, for the purposes of tillage. It is the natural tributary of the City. The whole of it, in process of time, those portions only excepted which are specially adapted to the culture of rice and the finer cottons— will be converted into farms; the production of which will not only render us independent of our Northern and Western neighbors, as respects grain, forage, vegetables, butter and cattle, but will be able to supply the earlier productions of the spring and summer, through the means of daily steamboats, to the cities of the North. We know how large, comparatively speaking, is the business already done in this respect. But the increase will be absolutely immeasurable and incomputable, when improved facilities to market shall have persuaded our planters along the Ashley and the Stono, to embark in the more lucrative business. What must be the effect of this, but the increased value of lands in these quarters, and a denser population? With a denser population, comes drainage; and, with improved agriculture, the use and absorption, into manures, of all refuse vegetable matter. Here we behold the the secret of salubrity in soil and climate; and all St. Andrew's may be made quite as healthy as Charleston and the Neck. What farther follows, from the introduction of this new system? Why, that the City builds up its back country population at its own doors; and the State keeps within its own limits, diffused among its own people, the hundreds of thousands,—nay millions,—which we annually send abroad for commodities, all of which ought to be raised at home. The money which you send North and West, for grain, forage, butter, potatoes horses, mules and cattle, never knows returning ebb. Not a dollar ever comes back to us. But, if we can create a population at our own back doors, which shall supply these commodities, all this money finds its way necessarily to the City, which can never fear a competitor as the domestic market of the State. Convert the lower districts into a farming region, with a tolerably dense population, and you save two millions annually to the State, which we now send out never to return. The Bridge over Ashley will contribute largely to this result. It is one of the most important steps in the career of local improvement. It supersedes a most tedious and expensive mode of travel. It invites and opens the way to travel; and other improvements hereafter, to continue from this, may even bring you a large and valuable wagon trade, from the middle counties of Georgia along the Savannah River. Editor.—Certainly, the present mode of ferriage, its expensiveness and frequent and vexatious delays, have led to the temporary abandonment, by the people of the interior, of one of the most delightful and eligible roads conducting to the City. Abbot.—No doubt of it. The complaints are endless in respect to the present system. Suppose you confine your view to the simple andvantages of a drive across the river and into the country? You may visit the Stono; you may stroll through the venerable precincts of St. Andrew's Church; you may take your dinner at Rantoule's, catch your own fish, and be back in the City in season for an early supper. And this over one of the finest roads in our low country—through most splendid natural avenues, in sight of lovely farmsteads, with the fruits of the season inviting you at every step, the song of birds to welcome you with music, and the gayest wild flowers to regale your eyes with beauty, and your nostrils with perfume. Only make the passage of the Ashley certain, at all hours, and make it cheap, and all the neighboring country becomes a garden; the farms become subdivided, cultivation becomes thorough, and the soil, under a good manuring system, is made to develope resources such as will surpass all expectation. The materials for vegetable manures are enormous through all this region. The miserable error, of which our people have been guilty, in all times past, has been that they destroyed the value of their works—their luxuries and necessaries alike, by the excessive prices which they put upon their enjoyment and use. They charged as if they were determined always to make the consumer feel that they were luxuries; overlooking the fact that no man, not even the wealthiest, lives habitually on luxuries. The proper process was to make the luxuries necessaries. This could only be done by making them cheap. When the “New Bridge” was opened, a natural curiosity led the carriage of the citizen, once or twice, across its arches, at a cost of a couple of dollars the trip! How often, at such a price, could he indulge in such a pleasure? Cupidity, like ambition, thus too frequently defeats its own objects. While one citizen made the journey at this expense, a hundred who would have relished it also, were compelled to turn up their noses, and cry “sour grapes.” But what would be the effect, think you, in regard to the uses of such a O bridge across the Ashley, if the four-wheel carriage paid twenty-five cents, and the two-wheel half that price; the horseman a fourth; and the foot passenger, but three cents; leaving the heavy wagon to pay fifty cents, and the loaded cart twenty-five? Why, the whole City would throng into St. Andrew's. Each would have his turn and come often. As a drive, and as a walk, it would become equally fashionable; and there is no pleasure so grateful to man as that which he enjoys under the reflection that his indulgence trenches upon no resources which can be illy spared from his necessities. I would guarantee the stock, the bridge costing not more than $60,000, as the very best in the country. Editor.—Ah! Father, shall we, indeed, realize these glowing predictions? Abbot.—Why not? I tell you, my son, the ball is in motion. Our people have shaken off their slumbers, and it is one of the inevitable characteristics of a popular progress, that, once fairly begun, it goes through its cycle of performance, for fifty years at least, before it sleeps again. The truth is, a great moral amalgam has taken place in our society, the affinities of which enforce progress. You will live to see the promise realized. You will behold the City, and all its tributary islets, and shores, and waters, and fountains, linked together by indissoluble bands of iron. You will see this goodly city, seated by the sea, sending forth her messengers, winged by steam and sail, to the remote and mighty cities of the old world! You will see the internal resources of our vast interior finding their way to profitable exchanges, through this medium. You will see our people, instead of gaping at foreign towns and crowded cities of the East, listless, and without hope or occupation, concentrating all their energies, whether for business or pleasure, in and about the sacred precincts of home. There shall they discover, not only that they have a business to execute, a profitable labor and a duty which love delights in, but pleasures to enjoy, more exquisite, and more legitimate, than any that could be found abroad. We have discoursed in vain upon these subjects, my son, if it is needful that I should recapitulate our frequent conversations. But my words are so many prophecies. The work is fairly begun, and our people are rapidly discovering “the Home Secret”—the secret of true worth, true wealth, true pleasure, and true virtue. Let us return.— Our Brother Bonhommie signals us from Prospect Hill.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">XVI. The night was one of eminent beauty. The winds were light but lively. The moon, unembarrassed by a clond, was making her smiling way through the heavens; and the broad expanse of ocean, smooth as a lawn of silver, lay basking in her beams. The gay sands were glistering with a thousand pleasant fires. The village of Moultrie stretched away towards the West, showing O2 like a fairy hamlet; while a solitary light revealed the distant City, sleeping serenely beneath the guardian watch of her ascending steeples. Immediately in the rear of Prospect Hill, a green and grateful stretch of forest lay in shadow, but not gloomily, touched, as were the tops of its oaks and myrtles, with the hallowing wand of moonlight. Such was the scene to which we were summoned by our considerate host and Brother, Bonhommie. He had spread his table for supper on the little white eminence of Prospect Hill, its brows partially encircled by a little coronet of myrtles. We shall not describe the supper, which was served in the best style of a taste that knew admirably how to mingle the delicate and the persuasive in his feasts. Coffee and tea were the essential spirits, and the venerable maid, Estifania, who keeps the keys at our Brother's farmstead, had shown herself singularly ambitious of securing the favor of the fraternity, being particularly desirous of the patriarchal blessing at the hands of our Holy Father Abbot. Her beverages were unexceptionable, and the accompanying cakes and cates, won the general approbation. Our Father was sad, however, and did not dilate with his usual fervor. It is probable that he has felt disquieted at the prospect of soon departing from a scene which we had all enjoyed with a pleasure having no qualifications. The same sentiment prevailed somewhat with the rest of the brotherhood. Beauclerk, in especial, was evidently humbled by remorse, at the unnatural feeling which had possessed him, though for a moment only, in regard to the Father Abbot. He was, no doubt, troubled by an anxious apprehension, lest the Father should have heard his language after dinner, in which he showed himself restive under that paternal authority which had kept his wild impulses in check. But there was no gloom in the assembly, as there was no asceticism in the speech of the Holy Father. The supper was gratefully discussed, and Brother Bonhommie was the happiest of men, at the tribute paid to his taste and hospitality. He absolutely wept when he heard the Father remind the brotherhood that the next morning was the time appointed for their departure from the Island. It is impossible to describe his satisfaction, however, the moment after, when one of the brethren reminded the Father that the next day was the Sabbath. Abbot.—Then we shall remain another day, my children; and, with brother Bonhommie's permission, we shall discourse to the fraternity in the sacred groves which lie east of his dwelling. Bonhommie.—Every thing shall be prepared, Father, for the occasion. At an early hour, chairs shall be carried out for the purpose. There is a peculiar sweetness and solemnity in hearkening to the words of truth and soberness in the deep silence of sheltering woods. Poet.—The groves, we are told, were God's first temples. Abbot.—Thou hast a hymn, dear son, descriptive of the Forest Worship. It shall be chaunted on the occasion. It is one particularly suited to the purpose; and as all discourse should be appropriate, O3 not only to the spiritual, but to the human condition of man, adapted not only to his particular nature, but to the circumstances and necessities of his life, so will I endeavor to encourage our Brother Bonhommie in the career which he has so lately taken up, by dilating upon the characteristics and essential attributes of “The Good Farmer.” Beauclerk.—Don't you think, Father, that brother Bonhommie might establish here a successful vineyard? Don't you think that the vine ought to flourish here on the side of the sandy hillocks? Abbot.—Undoubtedly: and the suggestion is worthy of consideration. There is one law which should encourage frequent experiment in agriculture. It is found in the fact that it is in the soul of man, rather than the soil in which he works, that his fruits must first flourish. And it is difficult to say what climate or situation could prove itself inaccessible to the determined energies of the human intellect. The mind is remarkable in no respect more than by its so readily accommodating itself to the most adverse scenes and situations. Received directly from Divinity, designed, in however remote a degree, to resemble the nature of the Deity himself, it is of that commanding and conquering quality, as to subject all soils and all circumstances to its imperial progress. It adapts the man to all climates, and may in like manner, adapt the fruits of all climates to the particular situation in which his lot has been cast.— The earth and all its creatures were decreed to obey his will. No skies can repel or discourage, no condition always baffle, or entirely defeat, the man of equal thought and energy. Unite these, and it is wonderful how much the individual may achieve to his own astonishment. Poet.—The history of the vine itself, Father, will abundantly illustrate this truth. Abbot.—Yes, indeed! If any sceptic among us shall apprehend that cold and capricious seasons here, will discourage the vegetation, and defeat the growth, of the rich and delicate fruits born under the blue skies and generous suns of of Italy and France, let him hear the account of these same fruits from the eloquent pen of Gibbon. He tells us that “it would be almost impossible to enumerate all the articles, either of the animal or vegetable region, which were successfully imported into Europe from Asia and Egypt. Almost all the flowers, the herbs and the fruits, that grow in the European garden, are of foreign extraction. The apple was a native of Italy, and when the Romans had tasted of the rich flavor of the apricot, the peach, the pomegranate, the citron and the orange, they contented themselves with applying to all these new fruits the common denomination of apple, discriminating them from each other by the additional epithet of the country. In the time of Homer, the vine grew wild in the Island of Sicily, and most probably, in the adjacent continent, but it was not improved by the skill, nor did it afford a liquor grateful to the taste, of the savage inhabitants. A thousand years afterwards, Italy could boast that of the fourscore most generous O5 and celebrated wines, more than two-thirds were produced from her soil. The blessing was soon communicated to the Narbonnese province of Gaul; but so intense was the cold to the north of the Cevennes, that, in the time of Strabo, it was thought impossible to ripen the grapes in those parts of Gaul. This difficulty, however, was gradually vanquished; and there is some reason to believe, that the vineyards of Burgundy are as old as the age of the Antonines. The olive in the western world followed the progress of peace, of which it was the symbol. Two centuries after the foundation of Rome, both Italy and Africa were strangers to that useful plant. It was naturalized in those countries, and at length carried into the heart of Spain and Gaul. The timid errors of the ancients, that it required a certain degree of heat, and could only flourish in the neighborhood of the sea, were insensibly exploded by industry and experience. The cultivation of flax was transported from Egypt to Gaul, and enriched the whole country, however it might impoverish the particular lands on which it was sown. The use of artificial grasses became familiar to the farmers both of Italy and the Provinces, particularly the Lucerne, which derived its name and origin from Medea. The assured supply of wholesome and plentiful food for the cattle during winter, multiplied the number of the flocks and herds, which, in their turn, contributed to the fertility of the soil”—and so forth. Bonhommie.—Is it impossible! How encouraging, all this, dear Father, to a young beginner! Beauclerk.—Brother Bonhommie has now a motive and a duty, at once before him. What a glorious triumph, if he shall succeed in covering those sand hills with the Scuppernong and the Isabella grapes. And why should he not? The whole southern slope of this range, might be made to flourish with the vine, which, springing up in the soil in the opposite side, would readily clamber over to this. Bonhommie.—I shall certainly try it. Beauclerk.—I have seen the Malaga, Father, produce fruit in our interior in four years after the planting of the seed. Bonhommie.—I shall try them all. Abbot.—And you will do well. The duty of the good farmer is frequent experiment—experiment so urged as not to interfere with his regular operations, yet so fairly urged as to leave him in no doubt as to the soundness of his conclusions.— The whole chapter which Gibbon devotes to this department of Roman economy, will well reward perusal. There is much even in this brief passage which deserves our consideration. If we do not suffer those “timid errors” of which he speaks, to keep us in perpetual bondage to the circumscribed condition of our present agriculture, we shall probably discover that our soil and climate are quite as congenial to the introduction of foreign products as those of any portion of the ancient world. We have, indeed, every variety of soil and surface.— The aspects of our country, in the three grand divisions of the State, are sufficiently diversified for every form of cultivation—and we are already rich in native and exotic productions, which only need that art should do her duty, in compliance with the suggestions of nature, to make them equal to any like objects of culture, in any other portion of the world. But we must beware of that “timid ignorance” which does nothing, under the convenient belief, which is always the argument of the slothful, that nothing can be done. Nothing is done, and nothing can be done, by those who doubt the ability of man—man, the appointed agent of God on earth—to do all things that God has ever yet permitted man to do. The earth is ours by the Eternal Bounty—but she does not yield up her treasures to the timid or the base. She has no fruits for the slothful. We must grapple her to our arms with a manly vigor, and compel the surrender of her virgin treasures. Poet.—What says the Roman Poet—the agricultural moralist of Rome in the Augustan period? “Not to dull ignorance, or transient toil, Great Jove vouchsafed the conquest of the soil; He bade sharp care make keen the heart, nor deigned That sloth should linger where his God had reigned.” Abbot.—Appropriately quoted, my son. Let us not forget, in referring to the passage taken from Gibbon, that the regions of France and Spain which were considered so unfriendly to the grape and the olive, are those very regions from which we now receive these fruits in the greatest perfection. The rich red wines of Burgundy, come from those very grapes which, it was feared, could not be ripened under the severely cold temperature of that region: and Spain and France are now ranked among the favorite and native gardens of the olive. Gibbon remarks that, in the time of Homer, the vine grew wild in Sicily, but that it was not improved by the skill, nor did it afford a liquor grateful to the tastes of the savage inhabitants.— Could the vine grow more luxuriously, could it twine itself anywhere more lasciviously around the forest trees, than in Carolina and Georgia—in greater abundance, or in more fruitful variety? Impossible! our swamp and forest margins are wondrous to behold, at the opening of spring, and in the maturing embraces of the summer, in their luscious and liberal exhibitions of every sort of wild grape. Let us not expose ourselves to the bitter sarcasm which Gibbon inflicts upon the Sicilians. How keenly would our children, of the seventh and tenth generation, feel the reproach of the Historian, who, a hundred years hence, might relate that, “in the time of President Taylor, under the local administrations of Governors Seabrook, of South-Carolina, and Towns, of Georgia, the vine grew wild in these and other States of the great American Confederacy, particularly in the Southern portions, but was not improved by the skill, nor did it afford a liquor grateful to the tastes of the savage inhabitants.” Editor.—He might add that, in more Northern latitudes, naturally less favorable to its growth, it was rendered more successful, nay, made to produce in abundance, under the working and restless energies of a people, who were compelled to supply, with constant industry, the deficiencies of a sterile soil and an unfriendly climate. The Scuppernong, a native of the South, receives its more successful culture in the North; while Ohio is already manufacturing more Champagne in one season, than France exports in a dozen. Poet.—I am afraid, Father, that the wonderful developments of gold in California will materially serve to injure our agriculture. Abbot.—I hope not. I think not. It is only the diseased appetite, that is drawn away from the homestead by such temptations; the feverish discontent, the hungering thirst, that would seldom have done any good at home; and most of these poor adventurers will be wrecked and ruined in their search. It will require wonderful energies, and still more wonderful capacities of endurance, to succeed in the mines of California; and success itself is destined, with the greater number, to produce the bitterest fruits, like those fabulous apples of Sodom, lovely and luscious to the eye, but full of dust and ashes within. What a delusion is this search! Poet.—An age of Gold? Abbot.—Iron, rather, my son! We must not confound a figure with a fact. In the imaginative world, gold serves the purpose of a noble illustration. In the actual, it only degrades the imagination. Beauclerk.—Was there ever a period which could properly deserve the name of the age of Gold? Abbot.—I think so! Yes! The period fanci fully denominated the “age of gold,” was not one of simple fiction. It had its date and existence, without doubt, in the progress of every primitive nation. It was unquestionably that period when the great majority of mankind was engaged in agriculture—when there was no strife of commercial enterprise—when the jealousies of trade provoked not to war, and its attractions seduced none from the paths of industry—before cunning had sapped the strength from manhood, and baseness had corrupted the soul of magnanimity! Agriculture, being expressly a divine institution, had the natural effect of subduing the passions of men, of regulating their appetites, promoting gentleness, harmony, and universal peace among them. The earth was enriched by judicious cultivation, and the population of the world was necessarily and proportionately increased as Cowper writes: “Their harvests over swell The sower's hopes: their trees o'erladen, scarce Their fruit sustain; no sickness thins the folds: The finny swarms of ocean crowd the shores, And all are rich and happy.” The principles of agriculture were simple, exceedingly. That they might be made so, God, himself, was the great first planter.[3] [3] Milton—“The Sovran Planter.” He wrote its laws, visibly, in the brightest, and loveliest, and most intelligible characters, everywhere, upon the broad bosom of the liberal earth; in greenest leaves, in delicate fruits, in beguiling and balmy flowers! But he does not content himself with this alone. He bestows the heritage along with the example. He prepares the garden and the home, before he creates the being who is to possess them. He fills them with all those objects of sense and sentiment which are to supply his moral and physical necessities. Birds sing in the boughs above him, odors blossom in the air, and fruits and flowers cover the earth with a glory, to which that of Solomon in all his magnificence, was vain and valueless. To His hand we owe these fair groves, these tall ranks of majestic trees these deep forests, these broad plains covered with verdure, and these mighty arteries of flood and river, which wind among them, beautifying them with the loveliest inequalities, and irrigating them with seasonable fertilization. Thus did the Almighty Planter dedicate the great plantation to the uses of that various and wondrous family which was to follow. His home prepared—supplied with all resources, adorned with every variety of fruit and flower, and checkered with abundance, man is conducted within its pleasant limits, and ordained its cultivator under the very eye and sanction of Heaven. The angels of Heaven descend upon its hills; God, himself appears within its vallies at noonday—its groves are instinct with life and purity, and the blessed stars rise at night above the celestial mountains, to keep watch over its consecrated interests. Its gorgeous forests, its broad savannahs, its levels of flood and prairie, are surrendered into the hands of the wondrously favored, the new created heir of Heaven! The bird and the beast are made his tributaries, and taught to obey him. The fowl summons him at morning to his labors, and the evening chaunt of the night bird warns him to repose. The ox submits his neck to the yoke; the horse moves at his bidding in the plough; and the toils of all are rendered sacred and successful by the gentle showers and the genial sunshine which descend from Heaven, to ripen the grain in its season, and to make earth pleasant with its fruits. Poet.—Verily, that was a golden period, indeed! Beauclerk.—Gold, itself, unknown! This is a still more encouraging picture, brother Bonhommie. Remember the grapes! (aside.) Abbot.—The origin of agriculture being thus dignified, the art was pursued by the Grey Fathers of the infant earth! Its kings and princes drove the harrow, and dropped the grain, and danced, with songs of thanksgiving, around the harvest. Their exercises continued to ennoble it; and, for ages, the destinies of the world were happily committed to the hands of men, whose chief distinction lay in their superior use of the sickle and the ploughshare. These were patriarchal ages. Toil, then, if a duty, was no less an unadulterated blessing. Nothing can exceed the sweetness which and felicity with the poets expatiate upon this happy period. They sang, in its praises, without qualification, that it gave health to the body, strength to the frame, energy to the will, and nobleness to the purpose—that it conducted temperance, pure desires, devout thought, and becoming patriotism—that it inspired happy feelings among the people, brought the young together in fruitful marriage, and blessed the eyes of the patriarchal fathers with glimpses of a third and fourth generation. These were the very days of Astræa—the days of peace, and sunshine, and innocent myrth; of a long life of youth, unembittered by disease— health to the last; and when death drew nigh, his approach was gentle and kind, like that of some friendly attendant, who lets down the curtains around us, and soothes us to repose. The toils of the day in this happy period, were begun and closed in music. The shepherds led their flocks over the mountains, to the delicious strains of flute and flageolet—drew them together by the same process when they wandered, and, with a like summons, compelled them to follow homeward at the approach of evening. Poet.—Will California ever realize such a picture! Portions of it must have done so—the great valley of the Sacramento—portions of it without doubt, but for this terrible discovery of metallic wealth. Proceed, Father. Abbot.—Such, no doubt, was the golden age of every primitive people. Unhappily, it was of short duration only. Man seems to possess an inherent quality of discontent, which perhaps, is one of the strong proofs, apart from revelation, of the immortality of the soul. His flute, with which the shepherd led his flocks to pasture, became, in the process of time, the agent of a sterner influence. That which had been the chosen voice of love, now spoke in louder language at the requisition of hate! The herdsmen and shepherds, when they became warriors, went into battle, “In perfect phalanx to the Dorian mood, Of flutes and soft recorders.” Hence the origin of martial music. The plaintive notes which had led the shepherds and their kine, and responded to their doubts and hopes, in melodious murmurs which betokened gentleness and peace, were now exchanged for those of angry warfare, wild passions, and insatiate ambition. “So violence Proceeded, and oppression and sword law, Through all the plain.” The application of an agent, once so innocent, whose only language, hitherto, had been that of love, to the purposes of strife and aggression, betrays, of itself, how large and how sudden was the change which had taken place in the minds and condition of the people. But this belongs, seemingly, to the usual, if not the natural order of events. The age of Iron had succeeded to that of Gold. Sterner feelings and passions overthrew the simplicities which had hitherto characterized the primitive races of the earth; even as the stronger appetites and desires of the man overgrow and absorb those, more gentle and limited, which prevail in the bosom of the child. Change naturally follows in the paths of prosperity, and the very accumulation of wealth occasions new desires, P and suggests new necessities. When men had so far advanced in art as to be enabled to tame and gather within their folds the wild herds of the plain and prairie, a portion of their numbers was necessarily withdrawn from the cultivation of the earth and assigned the duties of herdsmen. These were required to contend with the yet unsubdued monsters of the wilderness, to grapple with the Asiatic tiger, the swarthy and fierce lion of the Numidian deserts, and to level their sharp arrows at the breast of the vulture of the Caucasus. The herdsman consequently became the hunter, and the use of arms brought with it a passion for their exercise. The world soon became filled with a class, of whom Nimrod, that mighty hunter before the Lord, is a sufficient sample. The transition was not difficult, from hunting the wild beast of the forest, to hunting MAN! and WAR became the next and natural employment of the hunter. It was not easy for men, who had been accustomed, for years, to rove at will, in pursuit of their prey, to fall back, after their final conquest of the common enemy, upon the peaceful and regular employments of agricultural life. The occupation was too tame, too wanting in those excitements, the desire for which had become habitual, in consequence of their employment; and they yearned for the licentious pleasures of their wild and warlike pastimes. They had tasted the sweets of power—they had acquired the appetite for blood—they felt their strength— knew the weakness of the peaceful and unsuspecting farmer, and they selected him as their victim. He was more profitable as a victim, and far less to be feared as an enemy, than the lion of Numidia. The grain was no sooner ripened than the warlike tribes descended from the mountains to the plains, and gathered their harvests with the sword. Vainly did the farmer strive to defend his possessions. The savage, inured to arms, and delighting in their exercise, was necessarily triumphant. Butchery followed, and the devasted fields grew fat in the blood of those who could till them no longer. Who shall predict or limit the penalties which flow from every departure from the imperious line of duty? These crimes, this fatality, were the inevitable result, accruing from the adoption, by the herdsman, as a trade and occupation, of one of the incidental necessities of his condition. The first ordinances of the Deity were forgotten. The decree of labor, pronounced by the Creator as a judgment, has ever been borne, except for the brief and blessed period described in the “Age of Gold,” with discontent by the creature. The herdsman, too gladly becomes the hunter; the hunter, the warrior; the warrior, the robber; and the peaceful farmer, who feeds all, becomes the common victim. Hence, the desertion of fields, the depopulation of countries, the desecration of altars, the famine, the slaughter and unmitigated misery and devastation on every hand! In due proportion, as the pursuits of agriculture become insecure, the races of men decline. This is the unerring law of God's providence, and the unerring consequence of man's disobedience. It cannot well be otherwise; and with the decline P2 of a population will be the equally certain decline of prosperity and happiness. Poet.—We have an apt illustration from Goldsmith, Father—The Deserted Village. “Ill fares the land to hastening ills the prey, Where wealth accumulates and men decay; Princes and Lords may flourish or may fade, A breath can make them as a breath has made; But a bold peasantry, their country's pride, When once destroy'd can never be supplied.” Abbot.—It is through this process that most empires have been overthrown. The simplicity of the race has been lost, the more innocent appetites superseded by such as bring the worst passions into mastery. Such has been the common history. With the lapse of the patriarchal ages, Asia, the first and loveliest garden of the earth, became a desert, or something worse; Africa, a land of howling cannibals, which it must long continue; and when— Beauclerk.—Do you note, Father, the recent discovery of men with tails in that country? Abbot.—Yes, my son, but your suggestion would have kept until I had finished my sentence. Beauclerk.—Hem! Abbot.—And when, in the progress of pursuing centuries, Europe grew maddened with the perpetual and exhausting strifes between the spoiler, and the Providence of God vouchsafed America as a new land of promise, and of refuge to the fugitive, what was then the melancholy history? Did the story undergo a change? The colonists had glimpses there of a golden period of peace, but it was golden no longer. The iron age had succeeded to that of gold with the Peruvian and the Aztec, and the European colonists were not of a character to make any change from worse to better. In the region occupied by our immediate ancestors they found a wilderness, but it was not a peaceful one. Even here, the same bitter seeds had been sown, the same poisonous fruit eaten, and death was the consequence. The same inevitable fate had followed the same wilful disobedience of mankind. The departure from those holy laws which enjoined industry and blessed with abundance, had produced among the red men of the new world, the same profitless scenes of strife and carnage which had distinguished the career of the ancestral nations. It was the wretched boast of the American savage, that he was the conqueror of the country! that he had invaded a numerous and highly civilized people—that he had ravaged their fields; sacked and destroyed their walled places; and, having consumed the common enemy, had, at length, in the absence of all other victims turned the barbed edges of his thirsty tomahawk upon his own brother. But what was the history of the people thus destroyed? Were they wise—were they virtuous? For what unhappy sins had the Deity delivered them into the power of their wild invaders? Had they become inert in the accumulation of superfluous wealth? Did they disregard the wholesome laws of their creation? Did famine enfeeble their energies; or, in the sweet peacefulness of a golden age, that disarmed every domestic enemy, did they become heedless of those dangers which might follow the sudden presence of a foreign one? Perhaps, if we might trace the tale of their fortunes to its source, it would not be unlike that of all the rest! There was strife among themselves, which facilitated the progress of the invader, and sharpened his arrows. Faction strove with faction for the treasures of the commonwealth, or, which is the same, for its control. Then perished the public liberties. Then labor became a mercenary, and changed his ploughshare for the deadly brand of battle. Then industry and art were dispossessed of their fruits, and so, dishonored; and the city grew rank and ready for any pollution. When its suburban fields flourished no longer in smiling yellow, beneath the mellowing signs of the autumnal heavens, its golden age was gone—gone for ever! Then was it only fitting that the mountain robber should descend to the harvest that was ready to his hands. So long as he heard from its busy streets the clink of the morning hammer, and beheld the keen scythe throughout the long hours of the autumnal day, so long did he tremble to encounter the muscular hands which grasped them. But when these tokens of sure strength and manly virtue were withdrawn, then did he know that the age of Iron was begun. Toil had given place to cunning, and barriers of moral and physical defence were all swept away. The story is everywhere the same. It admits of no variation. The golden age is the age of agricultural pre-eminence. The nation whose sons shrink from the culture of its fields, will wither for long ages under the imperial sway of Iron. It may put on a face of brass, but its legs will be made of clay. It may hide its lean cheeks, and all external signs of its misery, under the harlotry of art; but the rottenness of death will be all the while revelling upon its vitals, and a poisonous breath will go forth from its decay, which will spread its loathsome taint along the shores of other and happier and unsuspecting nations! Beauclerk, (aside to Poet)—He has positively given us a sermon. Bonhommie.—Father, I have prepared a little display of fireworks. Abbot.—Fireworks! In the moonlight? Bonhommie.—No, Father, we will descend to the deep shade of this thicket. Our rockets only shall be sent up from the hills. You will be surprised at the exquisite effect of such a display on the Island. Abbot.—I can conceive it, heightened by an unembarrassed plain of earth and sky, by the free flight of the breezes, by the broad expanse of ocean, to say nothing of its wild chaunt, by way of musical accompaniment. When the new Hotel is built, the Town Council will need to make an appropriation for a display of Pyrotechnics every fourth of July, and Twenty-Eighth of June. Lead the way, brother Bonhommie. Bonhommie.—Take my arm, Father. We will descend this gorge, from the foot of which I have opened a private avenue to our little forest. I shall conduct you through the “myrtle labyrinth.” [Ex. Father Abbot, &amp;c. Manent, Beauclerk and Editor. Beauclerk.—Hist, brother Editor. We have had rather a long siege of it—rather a dry discourse, and I need some consolation. Step with me into this hollow. See what a bower we have here among the myrtles. Editor.—What are you after? Beauclerk.—(showing a bottle)—Do you see what fruits these sand hills yield. Said I not that this was the region for the grape to flourish in. Editor.—Champagne! Beauclerk.—A single bottle, which we may discuss together while our Holy Father gropes his way through the thickets. He has all the passion of a school boy for fireworks, and will not miss us. And now—smack! It is one of the drawbacks to the luxury of Champagne that it will always make due report of its own excellences. Abbot.—(suddenly reappearing)—Only when the creature is good, my son! If vain of its excellence, it has grounds for being so—not always the case with those who consume it. Fill the glass for your Father, Beauclerk, and congratulate yourself that I do not fine you a basket for this pernicious habit of enjoying your pleasures selfishly. Take this counsel also, my son, and be always sure that the master is quite out of hearing, when you undo the wire. Beauclerk.—(aside)—The Heathen Turk! The event passed off good humoredly, and the fire-works brilliantly. We retired early and rose with the red-bird,—rather prematurely awakened I allow, by the screams of an enormous pea-fowl, which is one of the pets of Brother Bonhommie. From the dwelling to the sea was but a bound and plunge, and we were soon ready for the events of the day. Breakfast discussed, we adjourned to a thick copse beneath the sand hills, and there listened to a most refreshing discourse from Father Abbot, as he had promised, on the qualities and characteristics of the good farmer—a discourse fashioned in his peculiar way; and mingling equally the practical with the contemplative and spiritual. This discourse was followed by an admirable hymn, written by our Poet, descriptive and laudatory of forest worship. The day was spent in pleasant and serious conversation of a kind not unsuited to its equally grateful and sacred import. The next day witnessed our exodus. It was an event full of interest and excitement. The Town Council attended us to the steamer, and we could see that most of the windows were closed as we passed the houses, denoting the grief of the inmates. Brother Bonhommie was inconsolable, and found it impossible to restrain his tears. One incident must not be forgotten: as we were leaving the wharf, Truesdell made his appearance, followed by a heavy wagon laden with his largest oysters, which he forced upon the fraternity, modestly contenting himself with asking a blessing at the hands of the holy Father. This was bestowed with the grace natural to our reverend head; and the gratified recipient of the blessing went away with a grateful heart. The oysters thus provided served the brotherhood amply at their next solemn supper. Verily the scene was a solemen one, indeed. It witnessed the resignation of our excellent Father. He proceeded the next day, with a party of the brethren, on an excursion into the interior; and, at last advices, was meditating the sublime and beautiful along the glorious precipices of Tallulah. These chronicles have all been taken by the Recording Secretary, from the volume numbered 7, lettered the “Book of the Island,” in the archives of the Monastery of the Moon. THE END.</field>
