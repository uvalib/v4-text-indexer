      <field name="fulltext">SKETCHES. A DAY AT RAVENNA. Shall we go see the reliques of this town? Twelfth Night On a gloomy evening, I found myself crossing the broad plains contiguous to the ancient city of Ravenna. These extensive fields serve chiefly for pasturage, and their monotonous aspect is only diversified by a few stunted trees and patches of rice. Nearer the Adriatic, however, the eye is relieved by the appearance of a noble forest of pines, which extends for the space of several miles along the shore. The branches of these trees, as is common in Italy, have been, by repeated trimmings, concentrated at the top; and most of them being lofty, a complete canopy is formed, beneath which one walks in that woodland twilight so peculiar and impressive. The effect is enhanced here, by the vicinity of the sea, whose mournful anthem or soothing music mingles with the wind-hymns of the forest aisles. As we emerged from a magnificent church that stands in the midst of this solitude, the interior columns of which were transported from Constantinople, no living object: disturbed the profound repose of the scene, but a group of fine cattle, instinctively obeying the intimations of nature, and slowly returning to their domiciles. I found no difficulty in realizing that this scenery, when arrayed in the dreamy influences of such an hour, should prove congenial to the poetic mood, and wondered not that Byron, during his long residence at Ravenna, found so much pleasure in coursing through this quiet country, and along the adjacent shore. The old city, like Venice, to whose triumphant arms, after so many fierce wars, it was at last subjected, rose from the marshes, and, although apparently at a considerable distance from the sea, presents, even at the present day, abundant indications of its marine foundation; and among them, the traveller observes with regret, the obliterating traces of a humid air, in the discolored and corroded frescos of the churches. One of the most valuable of these, however, has been singularly well preserved, considering that it has withstood the combined effects of dampness and removal from its original position—a process involving no little risk. This beautiful specimen is at present fixed in the sacristy of the cathedral. It represents the angel visiting Elijah in the desert; and dimmed as are its tints by time and moisture, no one can gaze upon the sweet face of the angel, radiant with youth, and contrast it with the calm, aged countenance and gray locks of the sleeping prophet, without recognizing that peculiar grace which marks the creations of Guido. Happily, some of the most ancient vestiges of art discoverable at Ravenna, exist in the more durable 1* form of mosaics. Several of the churches, but particularly the baptistry, and the sepulchral chamber of Galla Placida, are completely lined with this curious species of painting, evidently of the most primitive order. But by far the finest antiquity, is the edifice called the Rotunda, which, like almost every similar relic in Italy, with equal disregard to taste and propriety, is fitted up as a modern church. This building is the mausoleum of Theodoric. It is without the walls, and approached through an avenue of poplars, whose yellow leaves rustled beneath our feet, or whirled in wild eddies over the grass. The cloudy sky and the solitude of the spot were also favorable to the associations of the scene. The form of the structure is circular, and the dome is considered a curiosity, being constructed from a single piece of marble. It is likewise remarkable, that all attempts to drain the water which has collected beneath the building, have proved fruitless. A flight of steps leads to the interior, which has long since been denuded of its ornaments; and the porphyry sarcophagus which surmounted the structure, and contained the ashes of Theodoric, has been removed, and imbedded in the walls of the old building supposed to have been his palace. I could not but remark, as I afterward noted this ancient urn, the singular combination which seems to attend memorials of past greatness. The side presented to view, was covered with the notices of public sales and amusements, a purpose which it had evidently long subserved, while the mansion itself has been converted into a wine magazine. The fortifications of Ravenna, which were obviously constructed on no ordinary scale, have fallen into decay. Traces of but two of the many towers designated on the old charts, are discoverable; and a city, whose obstinate and prolonged conflicts with the Venitian republic are alone sufficient to vindicate the warlike character of its ancient inhabitants, now furnishes the most meagre evidences of former activity and prowess. The few soldiers now seen in its deserted streets, serve not, alas! to defend the town or enlarge its possessions, but minister to the ignoble purpose of draining its wretched inhabitants of their scanty resources. About three miles from one of the gates, a column commemorates the fate of Gaston De Foix. This brave knight, notwithstanding his extreme youth, had won so high a reputation for invincible courage and address, that he was intrusted with the command of the French troops, then struggling for the possession of Italy. When De Foix attacked Ravenna, it was vigorously defended by Antonio Colonna, who, in anticipation of his design, had entrenched himself with an effective force within the walls. After a warm conflict on the ramparts, the crumbling remnants of which still attest their former extent and massive workmanship, during which not less than fifteen hundred men perished in the space of four hours, the invaders were compelled to withdraw. At the instant the young commander was rallying his troops for a second assault, he was informed of the approach of the general army. They were soon fortified about three miles from the town, and the French warrior found himself in a situation sufficiently critical to damp the ardor of the best tried valor. Before him was his old enemy, of whose prowess he had just received the most signal proof, and near by, a fresh and vigorous army, while his position was utterly destitute of those accommodations requisite to recruit his forces, or afford the necessary provisions either for men or horses. In this exigency, he formed the resolution to force the army to a general conflict. Unfortunately for the Italians, the leader of their Spanish allies differed from the other officers as to the course expedient to be adopted; the one party wishing to remain within the entrenchments, the other advocating a general rally and open attack. The former prevailed. The adverse armies continued to cannonade each other for a considerable time, and the balance of success was evidently in favor of the allied army, when the Duke of Ferrara brought his highly efficient artillery to bear from a very advantageous position in flank. So unremitted and annoying was the fire, that the allies were at length obliged to rush from their entrenchements, according to the sanguine wishes of De Foix, and try the fate of an open battle. On that memorable day, the eleventh of April, 1512, occurred the most tremendous action which for a long period had taken place on the war-tried soil of Italy. As one wanders over the mouldering bastions and solitary campagna of Ravenna, and pictures the spectacle which on that occasion was here beheld, the contrast between the retrospect and the reality is singularly impressive. The shock of the meeting of those two mighty bodies is described by the historian of the period, as abounding in the awfully sublime. The action was sustained with a relentless fierceness, that soon laid the flower of both armies in the dust. More than once, the impetuous valor of the Spanish infantry threatened to decide the fortune of the day; but the Italian forces were at length compelled to fly, leaving Cardinal de Medici, other illustrious prisoners, and all their artillery and equipages, in the hands of the enemy, besides nine thousand of their number dead upon the field. The French loss was computed as still greater. But the most lamentable event of the occasion, was the fate of their gallant leader. Flushed with victory, he pursued the panting squadrons of the fugitives with unremitted ardor, when, as he flew over the hard fought field, at the head of a thousand horse, he was surrounded and killed. There is something peculiarly touching in the fate of this young chieftain. He had scarcely attained the age of manhood, and was already regarded as the flower of the French chivalry. Glowing with the enthusiastic, though mistaken zeal of the period, he had just led his soldiers to a victory eminently fitted to increase the fame of his arms. After a season of suspense, which must have appeared an age to his impatient spirit, he had met the opposing forces on the open field. Long, desperate, and dubious was the contest; but at length his gladdened eye saw through the smoke of battle, the retreating ranks of the enemy; his enraptured ear caught, above the din of war, the victorious shouts of his soldiers. What visions of glory must have gleamed before his imagination, as he spurred his charger over the conquered field! How sweet must have been the gratulations of his country, heard in exultant fancy! The lasting trophies of valorous renown were already won, and he was but in the morning of life. The wreath of chivalric honor, which his early ambition had pictured as a far-off boon, was already his. Yet, in that moment of triumphant emotion, when he felt the wreath of victory pressing his flushed brow, and heard, perhaps, the greeting of her whose smile would be the sweetest flower in his garland of renown, the fatal rally was made, and the gorgeous visions of gratified ambition were suddenly obscured by the mists of death! He fell, not at the fearful onset, when despair of success might have reconciled him to such a fate; nor in the midst of the struggle, when the influence of his example, or the desire of revenge, might have urged on his followers to yet fiercer effort; but at the close of the fight, when the day was won, at the instant when the clouds of doubt broke asunder, and the joyful beams of success blessed his sight. At such a moment, fell the young and valiant Gaston de Foix. In the academy at Ravenna, there is the statue of a warrior carved in white marble. The name of the sculptor is not well authenticated; but the work seemed to me remarkably well calculated to deepen the associations which environ the memory of the French knight. The figure is completely encased in armor, and sketched in the solemn repose of death. The visor of the helmet is raised, and the face presents that rigid expression, which we cannot look upon without awe. The very eye-lids are cut with such a lifeless distinctness, as to be eloquent of death. Thus, thought I, fell the veil of dissolution over the young soldier, whose bravery was here displayed. How affecting, with the story of his valorous energy fresh in the memory, to gaze upon such an image, and to feel that thus he became in the very hour of his triumph! Erroneous as were then the ends of youthful ambition, yet is there enough of nobleness in the associations of that epoch, to hallow its ornaments to our imagination. Comparing them with the selfish and narrow ideas which too often mark the manners and demean the characters of our day, we must sometimes lament, that if the ignorance and barbarism of more warlike times have departed, so has also much of their high and almost universal spirit of honor, gallantry and disinterestedness. Like most secondary Italian cities, Ravenna wears the semblance of desertion. At noonday, the stranger may often walk through streets deficient neither in spaciousness nor noble dwellings, and yet encounter no being, nor hear a sound indicative of life, far less of active prosperity. This was the case, to a remarkable degree, on the day of my visit, as it occurred during the month of October, when, according to the Italian custom, most of the nobility were at their villas; and the sanitary restrictions established on account of the cholera then raging in some parts of the country, had greatly diminished the usual numbers of passing travellers. In the piazza, at some hours of the day, there is a little life like appearance, from the assemblage of buyers and sellers, and, at early evening, the principal caffè exhibits the usual motley company collected to smoke and talk scandal, or to pore over the few journals which the jealousy of the government permits to find their way into the country. These restricted vehicles of communication consist of little else than an epitome from the French journals, of the most important political and other passing events, collected and arranged with as little reference to order and connection, as can well be imagined. It is owing to the garbled and confused notions derived from these paltry gazettes, to which many even of the better class of Italians confine their reading, that there prevails in this country such profound ignorance of the most familiar places and facts. Some of the ideas existing in regard to the United States, afford good illustration of this remark. A retired merchant, who was travelling in very genteel style; once asked me if Joseph Bonaparte was still king of America. A monk of Genoa, who was my companion in a voiture in Lombardy, opened his eyes in astonishment when informed that it was more than half a century since we had ceased to be an English colony; and another friar, whose ideas of geography were in rather a confused state, observed that he considered mine a very aristocratic country, judging from what he had read of our president, Santa Anna. A young Tuscan, of respectable standing, inquired if one could go from Italy to America, without passing through Madagascar; and a signora of some pretensions begged in a very pathetic voice, to know if we were much annoyed with tigers! Life, for the most part in these reduced towns, accords with the limited scope of the prevailing ideas. The morning is lounged away in listlessness; the ride after dinner, and the conversazione in the evening, being the only ostensible occupation, except during the carnival, when some theatrical or other entertainment is generally provided. Those of the resident nobility who can afford it, usually travel half the year, and economize the remainder. And if, among the better class, there are those whose range of knowledge is more extensive, or whose views are nobler, the greater part soon reconcile themselves to a series of trifling pursuits, or idle dissipation, as the appropriate offsets to their hopeless destiny. Sometimes, indeed, a rare spirit is encountered, superior to the mass, and incapable of compromising either principle or opinions, however objectless it may seem to cherish them; and there are few more interesting characters than are such men, in the view of the thoughtful philanthropist; beings superior to their associates, and worthy of a better fate; men who, amid degrading political and social circumstances, have the strength and elevation of mind to think and feel nobly, and seek by communion with the immortal spirits of the past, or by elevating anticipations, consolation for the weariness and gloom of the present. Occasionally, too, in such decayed cities, the stranger meets with those who, cut off from political advantages, and possessed of wealth, have devoted themselves to the pursuits of taste, and their palaces and gardens amply repay a visit. Such is the case with the eccentric Ruspini, one of the Ravenese nobility, whose gallery contains many valuable and interesting productions of art. At an angle of one of the by-streets of Ravenna, is a small building by no means striking, either as regards 2 its architecture or decorations. It is fronted by a gate of open iron-work, surmounted by a cardinal's hat—indicating that the structure was raised or renovated by some church dignitary, a class who appear invariably scrupulous to memorialize, by inscriptions and emblems, whatever public work they see fit to promote. A stranger might pass this little edifice unheeded, standing as it does at a lonely corner, and wearing an aspect of neglect; but as the eye glances through the railing of the portal, it instinctively rests on a small and time-stained bas-relief, in the opposite wall, representing that sad, stern, and emaciated countenance, which, in the form of busts, engravings, frescos, and portraits, haunts the traveller in every part of Italy. It is a face so strongly marked with the sorrow of a noble and ideal mind, that there is no need of the laurel wreath upon the head, to assure us that we look upon the lineaments of a poet. And who could fail to stay his feet, and still the current of his wandering thoughts to a deeper flow, when he reads upon the entablature of the little temple, `Sepulchrum Dantis Poetœ?' It is not necessary that one should have solved the mysteries of the Divina Commedia, in order to feel the solemn interest which attaches to the spot where the bones of its author repose. It is enough to know that we are standing by the tomb of a man who, in early boyhood, loved; and cherished the deep affection then born, after its object was removed from the world, through a life of the greatest vicissitude, danger, and grief, making it a fountain of poetic inspiration, and a golden link which bound him to the world of spirits; a quenchless sentiment, whose intensity vivified and hallowed existence. It is sufficient to remember, that we are near the ashes of a man who proved himself a patriot, and when made the victim of political faction, and banished from his home, wrapped himself in the mantle of silent endurance, and suffered with a dignified heroism, that challenges universal sympathy and respect. It is sufficient to reflect that the people who had persecuted the gifted Florentine when living, have long vainly petitioned those among whom he died, for the privilege of transporting his revered remains to the rich monument prepared for them; and that a permanent professorship, to elucidate his immortal poem, is founded by the very city from which he was ignobly spurned. It is enough that we see before us the sepulchre of a man who had the intellect and courage to think beyond and above his age, who revived into pristine beauty a splendid but desecrated language; who fully vindicated his title to the character of a statesman, a soldier, and a poet; and in a warlike and violent age, had the magnanimity to conceive, and the genius to create, an imperishable monument of intellectual revenge. THE CHOLERA IN SICILY “The blessed seals Which close the pestilence are broke, And crowded cities wall its stroke.” Halleck. In the modern history of pestilence, there are few records which can parallel, for scenes of horror and ceaseless havoc, the course of the cholera in Sicily during the summer of 1837. For many months previous to the outbreak of the disease, the commerce of the country had been essentially diminished, by a series of rigid and absurd quarantines; and so obstinate are the people in their belief that the complaint is contagious, that they still persist in ascribing its appearance in their capital to the introduction of contraband goods from Naples, where it was then raging. Notwithstanding these precautionary measures, no preparation was made in case they should prove unavailing, so that when the dreaded enemy arrived, the ignorance and poverty of the lower orders, and the utter absence of remedial arrangements on the part of the government, gave free scope to its awful energies. A still more shameful cause of the fatal triumph which it subsequently achieved, is to be found in the pusillanimous conduct of the physicians and agents of police, many of whom fled at the first announcement of danger. For weeks the multitudinous precincts of the city presented naught but the trophies of disease and death. In many instances the bodies were thrown into the streets; and not unfrequently from the carts which removed them, might be heard the groans of some poor wretch prematurely numbered among the dead. As a last resort, the galley slaves were offered their liberty upon condition of burying the victims; but few survived to enjoy the dearly purchased boon. The strength of the poor nuns finally became inadequate to transporting the rapidly increasing bodies to the gates of the convents, and these asylums were necessarily broken open by the becci. These wretches nightly made the circuit of the deserted streets, by the light of numerous fires of pitch, kept burning at long intervals, with a view of purifying the air. They sat upon the heap of livid corses piled up in their carts, stopping at each house where a light glimmering in the balcony indicated that their services were required. Entering without ceremony, they hastily stripped the body, and placing it on the cart, resumed their progress, generally singing as they went, under the influence of intoxication or unnatural excitement. Arrived at the Campo Santo, their burdens were quickly deposited in huge pits, and the same course repeated until sunrise. It is remarkable, that 2* of one hundred and fifty-six of those regularly employed in this way, but three fell victims to the cholera. The low situation of Palermo, surrounded as it is by high mountains, and built nearly on a level with the sea doubtless augmented the virulence of the disease. During several days in July, a strong sirocco wind prevailed; and no one who has not experienced the suffocating and dry heat of this formidable atmosphere, can realize the complete lassitude it brings, both upon mind and body. Engendered amid the burning sands of Africa, even its flight across the sea chastens not the intensity of its heat. It broods over the fertile valley in which the Sicilian capital stands, with the still and scorching intensity of noon-day in the desert. The laborers crouch beneath the shadow of the walls in weary listlessness. The nobility take refuge on the couch or in the bath. The paper on the escritoir curls in its breath like the sensitive plant at the human touch; and vases of water are constantly filled beneath the piano-forte, that the thin case of the instrument may not crack asunder. The fresh verdure of the fields withers before it, and the solitary streets, at the meridian hour, proclaim its fearful presence. The occurrence of a sirocco soon after the advent of the cholera, greatly augmented its ravages. Literally might it be said, that the pestilence came on the wings of the wind; and, unlike its course in other countries, it primarily attacked foreigners and the higher class of natives. But a few days prior to its appearance, I left Palermo for the other side of the island. The spring had been unusually fine. Daily excursions, at that luxurious season, nowhere more redolent of beauty than in Sicily, had made me familiar with the rich scenery of the `golden shell.' The same friends whose society enlivened these excursions, brightened the conversazione with pleasant intercourse and kindly interchange of feeling. It was with something of a heavy heart that, on a brilliant day, I gazed on the fast-fading outline of a prospect interesting from its intrinsic beauty, and endeared by habit and association. A young countryman, who had been my companion for many months, bade me farewell at the mole. We parted with many assurances of a pleasant meeting in a few weeks on the same spot, to enjoy together the festivities of St. Rosalia—the great national festival of the Palermitans, and one of the most splendid in Europe. As we glided out of the beautiful bay, my eye ranged along the palaces which line the Marina, till it rested instinctively upon the hospitable mansion of the American Consul—a gentleman whose home taught probity and application, and whose attachment to the principles of his country and the persons of his countrymen never swerved during more than twenty years' residence amid the enervating influences of the South. I knew that in that mansion, there was at that hour a gathering of social spirits, and remembered the kindly pleasantry with which the host had interposed his consular authority to prevent my departure, in order that I might make one of the guests. I turned to Monreale, perched so picturesquely on the mountain range above the town, and gazed upon the bold promontory of Mount Pelegrino, rising like the guardian genius of the scene, in solitary grandeur from the sea. With the aid of a telescope, I could trace the neat promenade upon which I had so often walked, unconscious of the passage of time, as the tones of friendly converse soothed my ear, or the passing glance of beauty cheered my sight. And as we were rounding the last point and fast losing sight of every familiar object, I caught a glimpse of the ancient and noble dome of St. Guiseppe, beneath whose shadow was the dwelling of one whose melody had often stirred my weary pulse, and still rang sweetly in my memory. At length the distant mountains covered with mist, alone met my eager view. The night wind rose with a solemn wildness, and the gloomy roar of the sea chimed in with the shadowy tenor of my parting thoughts. But the idea of soon revisiting the pleasant friends and favorite haunts I was quitting, soon solaced me; and the next morning, when I ascended to the deck, and found our gallant vessel cleaving the blue waters before an exhilarating breeze and beneath a summer sky, cheering anticipations soon usurped the place of unavailing regret. A few long summer days, and what a change came over that scene of tranquil fertility and busy life! They whose smiling adieus seemed so significant of a speedy reunion, were no more. The youth whose manly beauty and buoyant spirits I had so often noted on the promenade and in the ball-room—the leader in every plan of social amusement, the first to start the humorous thought, and the last to prolong the joyous laugh; he whose prime found every energy at the height of action, and life's plan widening with success; and the fair creature to whose meek brow I was wont to look for the sweetest impress of woman's dignity, as her voice was attuned to the softest and most intelligent expression of woman's mind—all, as it were, struck out from the face of the earth—gone from the freshest presence of Nature and the thoughtful scenes of an absorbing being, to the dark and solitary grave! Of a population of one hundred and seventy thousand, according to the last census of Palermo, within the space of two months, thirty-seven thousand were swept off: and within the city, the number of interments in a single day, when the disease was at its height, amounted to three thousand five hundred. Appalling as is the bare mention of such details, they are less calculated to shock the imagination and sicken the heart, than many of the subordinate and contingent scenes attending the pestilence. There is such a mystery and superhuman destructiveness in the rise and progress of a fell contagion, that the mind is awed as at the solemn fulfilment of a divine ordination. But when the unrestrained and savage play of human passions mingles with the tragic spectacle of disease and death, absolute horror usurps the place of every milder sentiment, and we are ready to believe that the pestilence has maddened the very soul, and despoiled humanity of her true attributes. To understand the scenes of violence and atrocity which were almost of daily occurrence during the existence of the cholera in Sicily, it is necessary to remember the circumstances and temperament of the people. Perhaps in no spot of earth do the extremes of civilized and savage life so nearly approach each other as in this rich and ancient island. Scattered over the kingdom, there are countless beings in a state of ignorance and poverty which, but for ocular proof, we should suppose could not co-exist with the indications of social refinement observable in the principal cities. These unhappy victims of want and superstition possess passions which, like the fires of ætna, break forth with exhaustless energy, and when once aroused, lead to consequences which it is impossible to foresee or imagine. Crushed to the earth by exorbitant taxation, and every national feeling insulted by the galling presence of a foreign military, it is scarcely a matter of surprise that when the long-dreaded cholera appeared among them, aggravated in its symptoms by the climate, and every moment presenting the most harrowing spectacles in the streets and by the way-side, they should readily adopt the idea that their oppressors had resorted to poison, as a means of ridding themselves of a superfluous and burdensome population. Nor are there ever wanting in every country, designing men, who, from the basest motives of self-aggrandizement, are ready and willing to inflame the popular mind even to frenzy, if, in its tumultuous outbreak, their own purposes are likely to be subserved. Such men are neither restrained by an idea of the awful machinery they are putting in motion, or the thought of their eventual danger; desperate in their fortunes, they re-enact the scenes of Cataline, and few are the epochs or the communities which can furnish a Cicero to lay bare their mock-patriotism and bring speedy ruin upon their projects, by exposing their turpitude. Were an unvarnished history written of the outrages which took place in Sicily in the summer of 1837, it would scarcely be credited as a true record of events which actually transpired in the nineteenth century; and while indignation would be deeply aroused against the acts themselves, a new and more earnest protest would be entered in every enlightened mind against the barbarous abuses of political authority—the long, dark, and incalculable evils for which despotism is accountable to humanity. In many places, the cry of “a poisoner!” was sufficient to gather an infuriated mob around any person attached to the municipal government, or upon whom the absurd suspicions of the populace could with the slightest plausibility, fix. The unfortunate and innocent individual thus attacked, immediately found himself at the mercy of a lawless crowd, in whose excited faces, flushed with a stern and ferocious purpose, no hope of escape was to be read; he was frequently struck to the earth, pinioned, and dragged, by means of a long cord, through the streets, the revengeful throng rushing behind with taunts and imprecations. In more than one instance, the heart of the poor wretch was torn out before the eyes of his friends. The fate of one of these unhappy victims to popular fury was singularly awful. He was one of the middle order of citizens—a class among whom was manifested more firmness and mutual fidelity, during the pestilence, than in any other; for the nobility, pampered by indulgence into habits of intense selfishness, and the lowest order, driven to despair by the extremity of their sufferings, too often entirely forgot the ties of parentage and the claims of natural affection, children abandoning parents, and husbands wives, with the most remorseless indifference. But among that industrious class, in which the domestic virtues seem always to take the deepest root and to flourish with the greatest luxuriance, there were numberless unknown and unrecorded instances of the noblest self-devotion. It was to this rank that the unfortunate man belonged, and his only daughter to whom he was tenderly attached, having been carried off by the cholera, in the hope of saving his own life and that of his two sons, they left the city and fled towards Grazia, a town in the interior. Before they reached their destination, the father was attacked by the disease, and it became necessary to seek refuge in the first convent. Here his sons nursed him for several days, until, being slightly affected with symptoms of the malady, the elder returned to Palermo in order to procure medicine and other necessaries. During his absence, an old woman whom they employed as a laundress, discovered in the pocket of one of their garments several pills composed of Rhubarb and other simple substances, which had been procured in the city to be used in case of emergency. She immediately displayed them to the peasants in the vicinity, declaring her conviction that the invalid was a poisoner. This evidence was sufficient. They rushed to the convent, drew the sick man from his bed, and beat him unmercifully. Meantime some of the party collected a quantity of straw and wood, and binding the younger son upon the pile, set fire to it before the father's eyes, whom, having again beaten, they also threw upon the flames, and burned them both alive. Soon after, the elder son returned, having received medical advice in Palermo which entirely restored him. Surprised at finding his father's room vacant, he inquired for his brother of a little boy, who replied by leading him to the spot where the charred remains lay; his violent demonstrations of grief soon attracted attention; his relationship to the two victims was discovered, and nought but the timely interference of an influential individual residing near, saved him from sharing their fate. The cholera appeared in Syracuse early in July. About the middle of that month, strong indications were manifested on the part of the people of a disposition to revolt; and the public authorities were convened to deliberate on the subject. There is no question that in this place the fears of the multitude were excited by designing men. The shop of a bread-seller was forcibly entered, and several loaves paraded about the streets as poisoned, doubtless with the express purpose of collecting a mob. This was soon accomplished, and the disaffected throng next proceeded to the residence of an apothecary, upon whom their suspicions fell, and, having taken him to the public square, murdered him. The Commissary of Police next fell a victim to their fury. The Intendant, hearing that the mob were approaching, made his escape by a by-lane, and applied to a boatman to convey him beneath the walls of the citadel. The boatman refused, and he was obliged to fly to the country. His pursuers, however, soon discovered the direction he 3 had taken, and, following with bloodhounds, traced him to a cavern called the Grotto, whence he was drawn and dragged into the city, where, after suffering many outrages, he was murdered before the image of the patron saint. The next morning the Inspector of Police, his son, and several other citizens, lost their lives. An old blind man was seized upon, and threatened with death if he did not give up the names of his accomplices. To save his life, and doubtless prompted by some malicious persons, he gave a list of respectable citizens, most of whom were instantly seized and put to death. Meanwhile, similar sanguinary proceedings were making many of the minor towns of the island scenes of outrage and blood; and as the populace of Syracuse grew emboldened by success, they published and circulated a proclamation addressed to their countrymen, commencing “Sicilians! The cholera, that dreadful disease, which has so long been the terror of Europe, has at length found its grave in the city of Archimedes,” &amp;c. going on to attribute it to poison, and calling upon their countrymen to eradicate it by removing the government which introduced it. Towards the last of July, a report was spread in Catania, that Major Simoneschi, of the gendarmerie, had taken refuge in the monastery of the Benedictines, and that he was a distributor of the poisons which had desolated Naples and Palermo. A crowd collected under the direction of several individuals of the rank of lawyers, brokers and mechanics, who assaulted the monastery, but not finding the person they sought, soon dispersed. As no notice was taken of these proceedings by the civil authorities, the mob were encouraged, and, in the course of a few days, attacked the police and other public offices, in order to possess themselves of the weapons there deposited. On the same day, the manifesto of the Syracusans arrived, was immediately reprinted by the rebel Catanese and sent off to Messina with a band to excite a mob there also. The town, however, was then under the protection of a civic guard; and all attempts to excite disturbances were vain. On the same evening, the Catanese arrested the Intendente, Procuratore Generale, and the commander of the gendarmerie, as persons suspected of distributing poison, and confined them under guard in the house of one of their nobility. They then formed a Council of Security, and raised the yellow flag in token of Sicilian Independence. The Intendente and Procuratore were forced to swear allegiance to the new government, and were then set at liberty—although their freedom was all but nominal, as they were kept under the strictest surveillance. The garrison, being small and inefficient, was soon disarmed. An original manifesto was published, declarative of the good deeds and purposes of the rebels. The bells of the churches were taken from their towers to be moulded into cannon. The pictures of the royal family were collected from the various public edifices and demolished, the statue of Francesco torn from its pedestal, destroyed by order of the government, and the revolutionary standard displayed in its place. The slight opposition with which these movements in Sicily were met by the representatives of the government, indicates the frail tenure by which Naples holds dominion over the island. And when at length measures were adopted to quell the disturbances, new scenes of horror succeeded. The Marquis Del Carretto was commissioned by the King to make the circuit of the island and inflict summary justice upon all implicated in the recent transactions. This officer appears to have been singularly fitted for his sanguiary vocation. Had the victims to martial law whom he caused to be sacrificed, been confined to the conspicuous among the mob, or even to such as had openly identified themselves with the violent deeds of the populace, we might consider him in some measure justified by the circumstances and occasion, in making such an example as would prevent the farther effusion of human blood.—But many an act of the most aggravated tyranny and cruel proscription perpetrated by Del Carretto, under the pretence of restoring public order, will long be remembered with indignation. There is a class of educated Sicilians, and chivalrous youth, who have cherished the hope of effecting the independence of their country, by means and at a period altogether different from those, into which the pestilence precipitated the fiery hearts of the less informed and the deluded. In the midst of the various and contending revolutionary elements then convulsing Sicily, there were not a few noble, ardent, and truly patriotic spirits who saw in the course of events consequent upon the cholera, a still longer postponement of their dearest hopes—a still wider chasm yawning between anticipated and realized freedom. The unfitness of the mass for the boon of self-government was made appallingly obvious. The gradual, healthy spread of liberal sentiment was suddenly checked. The government, long jealous and anxious for an occasion to inspire the people with fear, seized upon this moment to remove the most influential advocates of free principles from the pathway of liberty. If the revolutionists availed themselves of the cholera to excite the multitude against the government, the latter took no small advantages of the excesses of the people to revenge themselves upon the daring, intelligent and quiet promulgators of those truths which lie at the foundation of all successful innovation. Many a gifted young man was sentenced to die in two hours, upon the bare evidence of having uttered or written some expression indicating his hostility to foreign dominion; and not a small portion of the flower of the Sicilian youth were chased by a Neapolitan vessel of war beyond Elba—rending the air, as they flew before the breeze, with the glad strains of the Marsellaise. One of the King's manifestos threatened with death all who should believe in poisoning as the cause of the pestilence; and his indefatigable deputy, who had volunteered to avenge his cause upon the wretched Sicilians, passed rapidly from city to city, holding levees for the adherents of the crown, giving balls to the loyal ladies, confiscating the estates of the refugees, and shooting, after the merest mockery of a trial, all recognized ring leaders of rebellion and every one who could, under any pretence, be suspected of being a liberal. One poor youth escaped death only by flight who had been seen to applaud some patriotic sentiment rather vehemently in the theatre; and the name of one of the best 3* educated and finest young men of the island was placed on the bloody list merely on the dying testimony of one of the victims, wrung from him by the hope of a reprieve. After the lapse of a few weeks, public order was re-established. The pestilence ceased. Del Carretto returned to Naples. But it will be long before the melancholy traces of these calamities will pass away from the island, or the solitary places be filled. The King has since visited his subjects, and a reconciliation has been effected. Neither have their sufferings been wholly without political benefit to the Sicilians. Many privileges have been acceded to the different communities. New commercial facilities have been afforded, onerous regulations abolished, and the quarantine system revised. Nor can the conduct of a part of the inhabitants have failed so as to impress the government as shall henceforth command for them more respect, and cause their just rights to be more readily recognized.[1] [1] Later accounts however indicate but too plainly a renewal of the most despotic and baneful policy. One scene of which I was a witness, was alone calculated to produce no transient impression. As the news of the afflicting events which were desolating the other parts of Sicily, reached Messina, it threw the whole city into mourning. The arrival of the Palermo post was expected with an eager and painful interest visibly depicted upon the face of almost every passer; and at all hours of the day, the Marina was studded with groups whose auxious countenances indicated the one absorbing subject they were discussing. But on one occasion, the spectacle presented from the balconies, was by no means so quiet. A crowd had collected around the Health Office, which rises directly from the water's edge, and were clamoring to the deputies sitting within, to send instantly away a brig of war which had that moment entered the port from Naples, where the cholera was then raging, having been sent by the King, with clothing for the troops, then quartered at Messina. The circle immediately around the building consisted of the lower orders of the Messinese—porters, boatmen and mechanics— their disordered vestments, shaggy beards and fierce expressions, giving them not a little of a genuine revolutionary aspect. Behind these foremost actors in the scene, stood a multitude of the better class, regarding the movements of the rabble with simple curiosity or secret approbation. The members of the Board of Health thus found themselves in an awkward predicament. On the one hand, they feared to disobey the royal order to receive the clothing, and on the other they were threatened with the vengeance of an exasperated populace. Their reply, however, was indecisive; and so deep and vindictive a murmur followed its annunciation, that the frightened deputies deemed it best to effect their escape. With this view, they sprang from the back door and crowded into the boats which were drawn up on the beach, urging their owners to push off, and promising their adversaries in the rear that the obnoxious vessel should be forthwith sent away. It was ludicrous to see with what a compromise of dignity their escape was effected. Many of these worthies rushed into the water above their middle, in order to gain the boats. Their assurance of immediately complying with the popular desire, was received with a shout of triumph, and the crowd eagerly watched their progress as they glided on towards the quarantine harbor. When about midway, however, they suddenly veered and moved rapidly towards the citadel, within whose protecting walls they were soon safely ensconced. The rage of the people when they found themselves thus deceived, was beyond measure. They instantly attacked the deserted Health Office with clubs, stones and every obtainable missile, and in a few moments it presented a ruinous and shattered appearance. Scores of boys, half clad urchins, sprang through the windows like bees from a hive, bearing the records, account-books and files of papers connected with the establishment, which they deliberately tore into fragments, scattered to the winds or threw into the sea, which was soon whitened for yards around with the floating masses. In the midst of the destruction, it was curious to observe the behavior of the leaders of the tumult. One of them carefully conveyed away several of the most valuable articles, and deposited them in the hands of a highly respectable and popular citizen among the bystanders. Another took a silver lamp and threw it far out into the water, that it might be evident that their object was not to pilfer. One climbed to the front of the building, and having calmly cut to pieces the inscribed marble tablet, touched several times the king's arms which were inscribed above and then kissed his hand, amid the responsive shouts of the multitude; by this salutation implying that they recognised the allegiance due to their sovereign, and aimed vengeance only at the deputies. He then posted a small engraving of the Madonna in the place of the marble slab, thereby indicating that for the preservation of the public health, they trusted wholly to Heaven. Meanwhile, another leading spirit had raised the royal banner at half-mast, at the opposite corner, to suggest that the king mourned over the mal-administration of his officers. At length the municipal authorities fearing the consequences of further opposition to the public will, ordered the brig to depart, and presently she stood gallantly out of the harbor before a strong breeze. The exultation of the populace at the sight of this movement was without bounds. They abandoned the work of destruction upon which but a moment previous they had been so sagely intent, and ran along the shore beside the ship, brandishing their sticks and shouting fuore! (away!) until she had doubled the adjacent cape and disappeared. It was a scene of no ordinary excitement; the steady and swift course of the armed vessel silently gliding from the bay under a cloud of canvass, and the eager crowd with victory gleaming from their eyes, rushing on to hail her exit. Never was a popular triumph more complete. THE CAPUCHIN OF PISA. “Grey was his hair, but not with age.” Anon. For one inclined to a studious life, there is no more desirable residence, in Italy, than Pisa. The calls of pleasure and society which so constantly assail the student in the capital cities, are far less numerous and exciting here. Boasting the oldest university in Tuscany, Pisa, with the downfall of her commercial importance, lost not the attractiveness which belongs to an ancient seat of learning. The reputation for military prowess, gained by her brave citizens in the crusades, and the maritime consequence she enjoyed in the primitive era, when small vessels only were in use, are distinctions which have long since ceased to exist. She sends forth no fleets of galleys, as of old, armed with bold mariners panting to destroy the Saracenic pirates. The Islands in the Mediterranean, once tributary to her arms, now acknowledge another master. Bloody feuds no longer divide her citizens; nor has she ventured to dispute the empire of the seas since the close of the twelfth century, when she suffered a memorable defeat in a naval combat with the Genoese, under Admiral Doria. So great was the number of her distinguished people who, in this and previous battles, fell into the power of her formidable rival, that it was a common saying in that age, that, `whoever whould see Pisa, must go to Genoa.' The edifices upon the right bank of the Arno, many of them rich in architectural decorations, are built in the form of a sweeping curve admirably exposed to the sun. In these buildings are the best winter lodgings; and the broad street forms a delightful promenade. Here the invalids stroll at noon or evening, completely sheltered from the wind; while about the adjacent bookstores the literati lounge in the sun, to con a new publication, or discuss some mooted point in science or belles lettres. Sometimes on an autumn evening, when nature is in her balmiest mood, and the walk filled with students, the several bridges reflected in the river, and the avè Maria stealing on the breeze, the scene is delightfully significant of calm enjoyment. On a pleasant afternoon, as I noted this picture from beneath an awning which surmounted the door of a caffé, my eyes encountered those of a Capuchin friar, who was sitting on the parapet opposite, occasionally enjoying the same pastime, but more frequently engaged in turning over the leaves of an old folio. The members of this fraternity, usually seen in Italy, are very unprepossessing in their appearance. Their brown robes generally envelope a portly person, and the rough hood falls back from a face whose coarse features bedaubed with yellow snuff, indicate mental obtuseness far more than sanctity. This Capuchin, however, had an eye which, at the first glance, seemed beaming with intelligence; but, upon inspection, betrayed an unsettled expression, such as might pertain to an apprehensive or disordered mind. But the most striking peculiarity in the monk's appearance, as he sat with his cowl thrown back to enjoy the evening air, was the remarkable contrast between a face decidedly youthful, and hair that exhibited the grey of sixty winters. An effect was thus produced similar to that observed on the stage, when a juvenile performer is invested with one of the heavy powdered wigs of the last century. It was as if youth and age were miraculously conjoined in one person. The adolescent play of the mouth, the freshness of the complexion, and the careless air, bespoke early manhood, and were in startling contradiction to the thick locks blanched almost to snowy whiteness. The friar noticed my gaze of curiosity, and advancing towards me with a good-natured courtesy, proffered the curious volume for my inspection. It was truly a feast for a connoisseur in black-letter and primitive engravings—one of those parchment-bound church chronicles which are sometimes met with in Italy, filled with the most grotesque representations of saints and devils. The Capuchin it appeared, was an amateur in such lore; and this his last prize, had just been bought of a broker in similar matters, who had long watched for him on the promenade as a sure purchaser of the worm-eaten relic. Most patiently did he initiate me into the mysteries of the volume, apparently delighted to find so attentive an auditor. I observed that it was as an antiquity, and especially on account of the pictures, that he prized the book; and my wonder was increased by the general knowledge and worldly wisdom displayed by this member of a brotherhood noted for their ignorance. Perhaps he interpreted my curiosity aright, for when we had turned over the last leaf, he proposed an adjournment to his convent, that I might view his collection of ancient tomes, an invitation I was not slow to accept. His cell was at the corner of the monastery, and commanded a fine view of the surrounding country on the one side, and of the river and city on the other. It was neatly furnished, and not without ornament. He pointed out several bookshelves, and evidently enjoyed the surprise with which I read the titles of works usually found in the libraries of men of taste, but seldom known in the dormitory of the priest. At length, he raised them en masse, and what I had deemed a little library, proved but an ingenious imitation. Beneath the painted boards was disclosed the veritable collection of the poor Capuchin—a few vellumbound volumes, chiefly refering to the theology of his sect. I was not a little interested in the quiet humor thus displayed by this singular brother of a gloomy fraternity. His cheerful eye was at variance with the dark, rough robe, and coarse rope which bound him. His little room was furnished with a view to the enjoyment of the occupant; and, judging by the fine old Malaga with which he entertained me, not without the means of indulgence. I could not but fancy the feelings which must sometimes visit him as he gazed from his secluded nook upon the 4 world he had renounced. When, at dawn, he has seen one of the many equipages start from the adjacent square, bearing hearts intent upon re-union with the loved in the place of its destination, or youthful spirits eager for the excitement and adventure of a distant tour, has he not sighed for a share in the blessed ministry of the affections, or panted to throw himself into a more expanded sphere of experience? or, if sincerely deeming all earthly friendship vain, and all knowledge of the world unholy, in musing at sunset over the richness, the silent and varying beauty of that lovely landscape, has he not momently caught the inspiration of nature's freedom, and felt that the breezes of heaven are not less chainless, by Heaven's ordination, than the spirit within him? The Capuchin understood and interrupted my reverie. “Signor,” said he, “I perceive you are surprised at the obvious want of harmony between my character and my destiny. You think the friar's garb does not altogether become me, and wonder how it is that so youthful a brow should be shaded by hoary locks. I will endeavor to explain the apparent anomaly, if you are disposed to listen to a brief recital. A Corsican by birth, I reached the age of sixteen without clearly understanding the word— responsibility. My life had flown on beneath the paternal roof, unmarked by vicissitude, unembittered by sorrow. My education was intended to prepare me for a naval life, and, as far as theoretical knowledge is important, perhaps it was not valueless. I had acquired, too, some dexterity in the management of such small craft as ply about the Mediterranean coast. But no duty had ever been imposed upon me, which my own inclination had not suggested; and if at times, I was deep in mathematical studies, or intent upon displaying my nautical skill when a storm had lashed our bay into a foam, it was my native love of excitement rather than any settled principle of action, which prompted my exertions. I was regarded as a spoiled child, and the rebukes to which I was, in consequence, subjected, aroused my indignation more deeply than corporeal punishment often does that of less ardent beings. On one occasion, when smarting inwardly from a taunting reproach my father had bestowed, I suddenly resolved to flee, if it were only to prove that I could depend upon myself, and be indeed a man. Such resolutions doubtless abound at that age, and are not unfrequently acted upon. With a few louis-d'ors in my purse, I embarked for Marseilles, and after a few weeks' stay in that city, found myself without money or friends, and prevented by pride from revealing myself or my situation to any one. Want, however, was fast undermining my resolution; and one bright morning I walked towards the quay, hoping to discover some Corsican captain who would convey me home. As I stood near one of the docks, glancing over the shipping, I observed a man whose vestments were those of a dandy mariner, rapidly pacing the wharf. His keen gaze soon fell upon my person, and, at the next turn in his promenade, he abruptly clapped me on the shoulder, and, pointing to a neat brig with Sardinian colors in the offing, asked my opinion of her build and appearance. As I had been an observer of vessels from early boyhood, I answered him with frankness, introducing some technical phrases, which seemed to convince him that I was no novice in such matters. When I had concluded; `my lad,' said he, `I am the supercargo of that craft. Ask no questions, navigate her to Corsica, and this is your's,' shaking a purse before my eyes. Without hesitation I accepted the proposal. Mindful of my immediate necessities, and elated at the idea of entering our harbor the recognised commander of so fine a vessel, I banished all doubts of my capacity, trusted to fortune to carry me safely through the enterprise, and springing with alacrity after the supercargo, into a boat, soon stood with all the pride of youth mantling in my cheek, upon the quarter deck of the Maria Teresa. Several Jews were clustered about the mainmast, awaiting our arrival to secure their passage. They offered to make up what was deficient in the cargo, by shipping several cases of liqueurs, and agreeing to pay liberally, the bargain was soon closed. It was arranged that we should sail at sunset; and leaving the supercargo at his desk in the cabin, I hastened on shore to atone for my recent abstinence. The commencement of our voyage was highly prosperous. After several days, having been blest with clear weather, and favorable, though light breezes, I began to congratulate myself upon my success, when, one afternoon, there appeared along the horizon, indubitable tokens of a coming storm. I knew not precisely where we were, though I had concealed my doubts on the subject; and as night approached, a strange feeling of melancholy came over me. I leaned over the bulwarks, watching the ominous masses of clouds, and listening to the heavy and solemn swell of the sea. All at once, a sense of the responsibility I was under, began to oppress me. Misgivings crowded upon my hitherto resolute mind; and, at length, a presentiment of evil took entire possession of my fancy. Inexperienced, and prevented by false pride from exposing my fears, I bitterly repented of the task I had undertaken. I felt, however, that it was now too late to retreat, and observing an old sailor casting an eye of curiosity upon my anxious countenance, I suddenly determined at all hazards, to maintain the character I had assumed. The wind increasing, before dark every thing was snug on board, and at midnight it blew a tempest. The brig, heavily laden as she was, ploughed wearily through the waves, every timber creaking as she flew before the wind. Sometimes it seemed impossible she should rise after a plunge so convulsive, and a pause so awful. My heart beat with agonizing suspense, till I felt the quivering fabric slowly lifted again on the billow, to dive once more madly on her way. The mast fell with an awful crash, and for a second, the crew stood astounded, as if the vessel herself had burst asunder; but, when the extent of the mischief was discovered, they worked on assiduously as before. We were scudding under a reefed jib, and I stood braced against the companion-way, awaiting, with mingled feelings of awe, perplexity, and hope, the crisis of the storm. Encouraged by the firm bearing of our gallant bark, I began to think all would eventuate happily, when a flash of lightning revealed to me the old mariner on his knees by the forecastle, the other sailors standing in terror and dismay about him, and the Jews huddled together 4* apart, regarding them with looks of fear, which even the raging elements seemed not to divert. At the same moment a strong smell of sulphur filled the atmosphere. Conceiving a thunderbolt had struck the brig, and scarce knowing what I did, I rushed forward, and seizing the foremost Jew with a savage grasp, `base Israelite!' cried I, `are you the Jonah?' Trembling, he sunk upon his knees, and implored me for the love of Abraham, to spare his life, confessing they had stowed a quantity of aqua fortis in the hold. The mystery was explained. The jars of sulphuric acid had broken in the heavings of the vessel, and their contents mingling with the silks and woollen stuffs, produced combustion. The sailors already abandoned themselves to despair. In vain I ordered, supplicated and reviled. They lay in supine misery, calling upon the Virgin, and giving themselves up as lost. O the excitement of that hour! Years appeared concentrated in moments. I seemed endowed with an almost supernatural energy, and firmly resolved to stretch every nerve and sinew for preservation. With no assistance but that of the cabin boy, who alone listened to my orders, I threw off the hatches. A tremendous cloud of steam rolled up in thick volumes. Half suffocated, we proceeded to throw boxes and bales into the sea; saturated with the acid, they fumed and hissed as they struck the water. Our hands and clothes were soon terribly scorched; yet with breathless haste we tailed on, while the lightning flashed with two-fold vividness, and the gale raged with unabated fury. The sailors finally came to our aid; and after many hours of incessant exertion, the traces of fire were removed, and we sunk exhausted on the deck. The darkness was intense, and as we lay, still tossed by the tempest, a new and horrible fear entered our minds. We apprehended that we were drifting towards the Barbary coast, and should be thrown on shore only to be cruelly murdered. The horrors of such a fate we could too easily imagine, and with torturing anxiety, awaited the dawn. It was then that I vowed, if my life was spared, to dedicate it to St. Francis. The horrible scene of that night had revolutionized my nature. The danger passed like a hot iron over my soul. My previous life had been a pastime. This first adventure was replete with the terrible, and its awful excitement penetrated my heart. An age seemed to exhaust itself in every passing moment of our painful vigil. We gazed in silent suspense towards the east. There an ebon mass of vapor hung, like a wall of black marble. At length, a short, deep, crimson gush, glowed through its edge. Slowly the sun arose, and displayed to our astonished and gladdened eyes the farthest point of Sardinia. How we entered the harbor unpiloted, was a mystery to us as well as the hospitable inhabitants. From the vessel we hurried to the church, to render thanks to the Virgin for our deliverance. I threw my cap upon the pavement, and knelt at the first shrine. My companions uttered an exclamation of surprise. The intense care and apprehension of that night of terrors, had sprinkled the snow of age amid my locks of jet.” SAN MARINO. “With light heart the poor fisher moors his boat, And watches from the shore the lofty ship Stranded amid the storm.” Wallenstern. The ancient Via Emilia is still designated by an excellent road which crosses Romagna in the direction of the Adriatic. It traverses an extensive tract of fertile land, chiefly laid out in vineyards. As we passed through this rich and level country, the occasional appearance of a team drawn by a pair of beautiful grey oxen and loaded with a reeking butt of new wine, proclaimed that it was the season of vintage. But autumn was not less pleasingly indicated, by the clusters of purple grapes suspended from cane-poles at almost every cottage-window, and by the yellow and crimson leaves of the vines, that waved gorgeously in the sun as far as the eye could reach, like garlands with which departing summer had decorated the fields in commemoration of the rich harvest she had yielded. The single companion who shared with me the open carriage so well adapted for such a jaunt, was a large landed proprietor in the neighboring district, and, being quite familiar with every nook and feature of the surrounding country, he endeavored to amuse me by pointing out all objects of interest with which we came in view. Here was a little chapel under whose walls a notorious thief concealed an immense treasure, and when the term of his imprisonment had expired, returned and disinterred it. There was the Devil's bridge, so called because it is said to have been built in a single night. This veteran beggar, distinguished from the mendicant group of the village by the erect air of his emaciated figure, was a soldier under Napoleon, and has now roamed back to his native town, to live on the casual alms of the passing traveller; while that stout and well-clad man who succeeded, with the loss of a thumb, in arresting a formidable bandit, is living snugly on a pension. The shallow stream over which we are now passing is believed to be the Rubicon. You gay contadina with large silver ear-rings, whose laugh we hear from the chaise behind, is a bride on her way from church; and that white and flower-decked crib which a peasant is carrying into his cottage, is the bier of a child. It was only at long intervals that the agreeable though monotonous scenery was varied to the view, and within the precincts of the towns scarcely a single pleasing object could the eye detect, to counteract the too obvious evidences of human misery. In all the Papal villages, indeed, the same scene is presented. At every gate the traveller is dunned for his passport by an Austrian guard, whose mustaches and cold northern visage are as out of place in so sunny a region, as would be an orange-grove amid the sands of Cape Cod, or annoyed by the wretched inheritor of one of the noblest of ancient titles—a Roman soldier, clad in a loose, brown, shaggy coat, who after keeping him an hour to spell out credentials which have been read a score of times since he entered the territory, has the effrontery to ask for a few biocchi to drink his health at the nearest wine-shop. When, at length, one is allowed to enter and hurry through the dark, muddy streets, no sign of enterprize meets the gaze, but a barber's basin dangling from some doorway, a crowd collected around a dealer in vegetables, or, if it be a festa, a company of strolling circus-riders, decked out in tawdry finery, cantering round to collect an audience for the evening. No activity is manifested, except by the vetturini who run after the carriage, vociferating for employment, and the paupers who collect in a dense crowd to impede its progress. In the midst of such tokens of degradation, planted in the centre the square, rises a statue of some pope or archbishop in bronze or marble, with tall mitre and outstretched arm; and, as if to demonstrate the imbecility of the weakest and most oppressive of Italian governments, around the very pedestal are grouped more improvidents than would fill a hospital, and idle, reckless characters enough to corrupt an entire community. There is something peculiarly provoking in the appearance of these ugly, graceless statues, which are so ostentatiously stuck up in every town throughout the Pontifical states—the emblem of a ruinous and draining system, which has reduced these naturally fertile localities to their present wretchedness, towering, as it were, above the misery it has occasioned. The inclined head, and arm extended as if in the act of blessing, is a benignant, humble posture, in ridiculous contrast to the surly soldiery and countless mendicants, who seem to constitnte the legitimate subjects of Papal favor. Rimini is one of the most ancient of these appendages to the Roman states, and boasts of a few antiquities, with which the traveller can beguile an hour, while some of the excellent fish fromthe adjacent bay, are preparing for his supper. Upon the principal piazza, a large palace, which presents nothing without but a broad front of mutilated brick-work, and within is newly fitted up in modern style, is pointed out as the former dwelling of Francesca di Rimini, whose singularly melancholy story constitutes the most beautiful episode of Dante's Inferno, has been dramatized by Silvio Pellico, and forms the subject of one of Leigh Hunt's most graphic poems. If the visitor endeavors to recall to his mind the knightly splendor which, at that epoch, the scene before him presented, and a strain of martial music swell upon the air as if to aid his fancy, the illusion is quickly dispelled when, instead of a company of gallant courtiers, an Austrian regiment in plain uniform winds in view, marching from the parade ground to their quarters. On a fine October morning, I resolved to escape awhile from scenes thus darkened by despotism, and make an excursion to a spot still hallowed by the presence of freedom. The approach to San Marino is through a pleasant and fertile country, and a small bridge indicates the line which divides the republican territory from Rimini. After crossing this boundary, the road becomes more hilly, and the aspect of the surrounding fields more variegated, displaying numerous small oaks and elms, clumps of olive trees, and patches of yellow cane. In many spots, well clad and hardy looking women were breaking the glebes in the newly-ploughed land, to prepare it for the reception of grain or vines. Nothing can be more picturesque than the site of the town. It is built upon the summit of a hill which presents an almost perpendicular cliff to the approaching traveller, the rocky face of which is relieved by a grove of chesnuts whose autumn-tinted leaves waved in umbrageous masses among the grey stones. As we draw near, it struck me as a most appropriate eyry for the “mountain nymph, sweet liberty.” The very air seemed instinct with freedom, and every step along the winding road to bring us to a region of more elevated and bracing influences. As we thus approach, let us trace the history of a spot which, amid the countless vicissitudes that involved in ruin every other community in Italy, preserved through so many centuries, the name and privileges of a republic. The remarkable mountain upon which the town of San Marino is built, was anciently called Titano, perhaps in reference to certain gigantic bones found buried there, but more probably in allusion to its isolated position as if thrown on the plain by one the fabulous giants of antiquity. It retained this primitive appellation until the ninth century. On one side, it presents a beautiful line of hills rising in picturesque gradation, and on the other, a dissevered cliff surmounted by an abrupt wall of rock. The soil is argillaceous and abounds in sulphur, petrified shells and valuable mineral springs, some of which enjoy considerable celebrity for their sanative qualities among the inhabitants of the surrounding districts. This spot thus favored by nature, might have remained unknown to fame, had not a certain Dalmatian by the name of Marino, a lapidary, come to Rimini, and having occasion to visit Titano, where he discovered abundant materials for his art, found it no less adapted to afford a retreat from persecution and a fit retirement for a tranquil, free, and religious life. Favored by the archbishop of Rimini, he established himself on the mountain, and was resorted to on account of his benevolence and piety, till the number of the faithful who became attached to the place induced the formation of a settlement and the erection of a church. Marino was believed to work miracles, and soon became renowned. By the eleventh century, agreeable to the universal system of defensive structures forming throughout Italy, the republic was in a measure fortified by the rearing of a castle. The zeal of the people in effecting this object is no small evidence of their attachment to freedom, which is not less signally indicated by the remarkable and at that period unique inscription placed upon their church—DIVO. MARINO. PATRONO. ET LIBERTATIS AUCTORI. During the succeeding age, in consequence of the increasing population, the inhabitants of Il Castello, as the summit was called, divided, a portion descending to the first table land now called Il Borgo. About this time, rose into power some of those mighty families who so long and fiercely tyrannized over Italy. 5 From its very infancy, the republic was surrounded by these despotic rivals, especially the Feltreschi, Malatesti and Faggiuoli, and, although frequently involved in the most trying dilemmas, preserved its love of liberty and its actual independence. In the twelfth century, when the warfare between the adherents of the Emperor and the Pope, convulsed the Italian states, although San Marino was in a much happier condition to enjoy the benefits for which some contended in the struggle, it was long before the demon of faction invaded the peaceful precincts of the republic. The archbishop Ugolino gave the spirit of party, birth. He was a violent Ghibelline. His ardor in the cause attached many to him, and when the people subsequently purchased of the neighboring barons land to accommodate their increasing population, he succeeded by means of priestly influence, in becoming a distinct party in the contract, evidently with a view to obtain some feudal authority and join temporal to spiritual power. Thesame attempt was made, on a similar occasion, by his successor. The inhabitants were well identified with the Ghibelline party, and when it was overthrown in Romagna, afforded a secure asylum to its members and most illustrious leader in that region. Toward the close of the century, while Hildebrand reigned, Teodorico, the bishop, proceeded to levy certain church tributes upon all the provinces, including San Marino. Upon the republicans asserting their independence, an examination of their claims to the distinction resulted in his withdrawing the demand, and acknowledging by a public decree, the entire liberty of the republic. This is one of the earliest recorded testimonies to the original liberty of San Marino, and is the more remarkable from having occurred at a period when the authority of the church was so profoundedly reverenced, and her officers so unwearied and importunate in their exactions. A like attempt to impose taxes was made soon after by the neighboring podestas, and upon a similar refusal being returned by the republic, the subject was referred to a solemn trial, according to the practice of the times. At this examination, it appears that not only were the facts of their history questioned, but the leading men catechized even upon the metaphysical basis of their rights, being asked “what is liberty?” and sundry other abstract problems; but their historian, with characteristic partiality perhaps, declares that the honest republicans were not in the least puzzled or confounded, but exhibited an extraordinary strength and clearness of purpose, as well as a singular unanimity of feeling, on this memorable occasion. The result, however, was a declaration against them, and a formal assertion of the right to tax on the part of the church and other authorities. Whether this right was ever enforced is very doubtful, but from the endeavor never being repeated, the inference is that the parties either from respect to the people or from motives of policy, were content with merely asserting their claims. The simple majesty of its political character seems to have proved remarkably efficacious, even at this early period, in securing for San Marino a degree of consideration wholly disproportionate to its diminutive size. Early in the fourteenth century, the supreme magistrate's title of Consul was changed to that of Captain or Defender, and because of the abuse of the latter in Italy, the former was ultimately alone retained. At this period commenced a series of difficulties with Rimini, induced by clashing interests and rival jealousies. The annalist of the epoch is at great pains to show, that the connection between the various powerful families of the neighboring territory and the republic, was simply a mutual league implying no subjection. This assertion is confirmed by the singular fidelity manifested by the people towards friendly barons. The threat of excommunication failed to make them abandon a certain feudal lord, who fled to their citadel to escape the vengeance of Pope John. It is proved also, by several existing documents, that their relations with the Feltreschi and other distinguished families who have been supposed to have exercised feudal authority over San Marino, were merely those of friendly alliance. Thus they appear to have been wholly exempt from temporal dominion, and as to spiritual, the assumption of cardinal Andrimini, in 1368, was withdrawn by solemn decree, and the bishop obliged to disclaim publicly any intention of seeking authority. Soon after, a more insidious enemy to the republic arose in one of its own citizens, Giacomo Pelizzaro, who plotted with the Podesta of Brescia and the archbishop of Montefeltre; to deliver San Marino into their hands. His plan was happily discovered before its execution. He confessed and suffered death as a traitor. During the succeeding era of private and bloody feuds, San Marino, allied to Count Guido, was more fortunate than the rest of Italy in escaping the dangers of this and other alliances, by means of which, teachery or the exigencies of the times could have so easily procured the republic's ruin. A war with Sigismondi Pandolfo, Signore of Rimini, ended in his downfall and an increase of their territory, attested to them in 1463. Now, too, we find the alliance of the little state sought by the larger and superior principalities of Italy, a fact only to be accounted for by the reputation it enjoyed for the character of its institutions. In 1491, during one of those fitful intervals of peace which occasionally blessed that age of war and turbulence, among the meliorations of the civil code, we find statues enforcing the immediate payment of public debts, the proclamation of criminal sentences, the obligation of the captains to procure as far as possible treaties of peace and good fellowship, and prohibiting the flogging of children under four years of age. At this time, some of the warriors from San Marino gained much renown in the battles of the age, and several men of distinguished talents arose, among whom were two of the earliest commentators of Dante. The republic appears to have been singularly favored in her diplomatic agents. Her ambassadors were most wisely selected, and to the firmness and wisdom which marked their proceedings is to be ascribed the almost miraculous escape of the state from embroilments with other powers, and accounts, in no small degree, for the remarkable esteem she gained in Italy. A most dangerous era for San Marino was the time of the infamous Cæsar Borgia, and for a limited space she placed herself under the protection of the Duca del Valentino. 5* Continuing, however, to enjoy the amity of the illustrious house of Urbino, she maintained to an almost incredible extent, the favor of the church, and afforded a refuge, often at great risk, to the many persecuted victims of all parties. The spirit of faction and the priestly pretensions which have ever been the bane of the Italian states, too soon, however, induced a fatal dereliction from the primitive patriotism and honest attachment to freedom. Another cause of this decline, may be found in the influence of some of those who sought an asylum within the limits of San Marino. Refugees from all parties, they naturally brought and disseminated much of the perverse and exciting spirit of the times, among the less sophisticated inhabitants. For these and other reasons, the commencement of the seventeenth century found the people more exposed than they had been to the subjection which the agents of the Romish church so constantly and insidiously endeavored to effect. An intriguer, according to history, combining all the low cunning, ambition and ready talent necessary to promote this object, soon appeared. Alberoni being legate in Romagna, undertook to befriend certain men who were suffering under the just awards of the tribunal of San Marino. The republic, from the deep conviction of the bad results produced by allowing justice to be impeded by priestly intervention and commenditizie, which custom had been grossly abused at that period, made rigid enactments against it; notwithstanding which, the haughty prelate insisted upon the privilege. The republicans vainly explained and remonstrated; yet boldly maintained their rights. Alberoni, by way of revenge, caused certain of their citizens to be imprisoned in Rimini, and by cutting off their communication with the surrounding country endeavored to produce a famine. At the same time, his efforts were unremitted to seduce the most ill-disposed of the citizens, and he succeeded in securing the cöoperation of many traitorous abettors. Misrepresenting them to the Pope and sacred college, and abusing the authority vested in him by the pontiff, he artfully induced that ruler to exert a special commission in his favor, and under its shield endeavored to annex San Marino, as forfeited, to the papal territory. At length, every thing being prepared for the consummation of his vile project, on the twenty-fourth of October, 1739, attended by a band of his satellites, he passed through the Borgo, and was even cheered by some of the infatuated citizens. He entered the sacred temple dedicated to Liberty and their Saint, where he smoothed over with subtle words the nefariousness of his scheme; and Capitano Giangi thus acknowledged his concurrence: “Nel dì primo di Ottobre giurai fedeltà al mio legittimo principe della Republica di San Marino; quel giuramento confermo e cosi giuro.” Giuseppe Onofri repeated the same oath; but, Girolamo Gori using the words of the Saviour—“let this cup pass from me”—protested that he had not made one mark of shame upon the face of the protecting saint, but would ever exclaim “Evviva San Marino, evviva la Liberta!” These words uttered with enthusiasm, were caught and repeated, until they resounded through the holy edifice, re-awakening the dormant patriotism of the people and striking fear into the heart of the usurper. The functions were abruptly closed and a scene of disorder ensued. Before Alberoni left the church, he threatened the rebellious with death. The faithful remained to concert measures for the safety of their country. Perceiving that an immediate appeal to force would be useless, they determined to represent the case to the Pope and calmly await the result, meantime using every means to reanimate the drooping spirit of their fellow-citizens. Notwithstanding the age and imbecility of Clement XII., he was just and benevolent, and upon being informed of the facts, indignantly declared that he had vested no authority in the legate to attempt obtaining any ascendancy over the people of San Marino, nor to interfere with their rights—but simply to exert a spiritual influence and protection. To contravene the base assumption of Alberoni, he despatched Monsignor Napolitano, afterwards Cardinal, with power to re-establish the good fame of the papal court, and secure justice to the people. Between the usurpation of Alberoni and the restitution of the republic, there was, however, an interregnum of three months and a half. San Marino was restored on the fifth of February, the day of the sacred virgin Agatha. Shouts, prayers, tears of joy, and jubilee in every form, announced the happy event; and the day has since been observed as a festival. Alberoni's defence of his conduct gave rise to some curious literary discussion. The event redounded to the improvement of the people, operating as an effectual check upon the passion for intrigue, and to the honor of Clement, to whom a monument was erected by the grateful republicans. When the modern conqueror of Europe drew near the confines of the small but honored state, he respected its liberties. Receiving most graciously the ambassadors from San Marino, in an elegant address, he alluded to the singular preservation of their freedom, and promised his protection; at the same time offering to enlarge their possessions, and tendering, as an indication of his respect and good will, a present of two field-pieces. Monge, the ambassador, made an eloquent reply, gratefully acknowledging the courtesy of Napoleon and applauding his forbearance. The people declined his offers and present; but in commemoration of the occasion, added the 12th of February, 1797, as another joyous anniversary, to the republic's calendar. The original government was simply paternal. The laws sprang from necessity, were improved by experience, and modified from time to time, according to the circumstances and wants of the people. Two captains, one from the signors and one from the citizens at large, are elected every six months. No individual can be re-elected oftener than once in three years. Thus all deserving the honor, serve in turn. No prejudice exists with respect to age, very young men being frequently chosen when of great promise or proved worth. It is only indispensable that the captains should be natives of the republic. The legislative body consists of a council of seventy and another of twelve. A judicial magistrate is also elected triennially by the council. The state includes a circuit of twenty-five miles, and its present population is between six and seven thousand. Such is a brief sketch of the history of San Marino. Its long immunity from conquest and despotism and the remarkable perpetuity of its institutions, are doubtless owing, in no small measure, to its insignificant size and almost impregnable position. Still the place cannot but possess a singular interest in the view of a pilgrim from the New World, especially when its present condition is contrasted with that of the rest of Italy, and more particularly of the surrounding territory. A few humble domiciles scattered along the lower ridge of the mountain, and separated by a narrow and rugged street, constitute “Il Borgo.” Thence, ascending by a circuitous path, we soon arrived at a larger collection of houses which form the capital of the republic. It differs not essentially from similar Italian towns, except that the streets are narrower and more straggling. The new church, just completed, is a pretty edifice built of travertina, excavated near by, after the design of Antonio Sara. The twelve apostles in stucco, placed in niches, ornament the interior, and near the altar is a handsome marble statue of Saint Marino, recently executed by a Roman Sculptor. He is represented holding a scroll, upon which the arms of the republic (three towers surmounted by as many pens, significant of the union of strength and wisdom) are sculptured in bronze, with the word Libertas. This edifice continues as in ancient times, the place of elections as well as of worship. There is a little theatre where dilletanti occasionally perform. I was at some pains to enter this miniature temple of Thespis, for the sake of standing in the only theatre in Italy exempt from censorship, and where, although the audience is small and the spot isolated, free expression is given to any sentiment or opinion which the people choose to utter or applaud. Crossing a grass-grown and solitary court near the walls, where four or five cisterns alone gave signs of the vicinity of man, we entered a small and time-worn building ornamented by an old tower and clock, and ascending a narrow flight of steps, were ushered into the council-room. A few wooden seats scattered over the brick floor, upon the back of which are rudely painted the arms of the republic, surround an ancient chair covered with crimson velvet, placed beneath a canopy of the same hue. A mutilated picture of the Holy Family by Giulio Romano, and a bust of their favorite ambassador, Antonio Honuphrio, are the only ornaments of which the apartment boasts. I had lingered, but a day or two previous, in the magnificent halls of some of the Bolognese nobility, where the silken drapery, rich marbles and splendid works of art, weary the gaze. But this plain and unadorned chamber possessed an interest which their profuse decorations failed to inspire. It bespoke narrower resources but a richer spirit. The presence of freedom seemed to hallow every sunbeam that played upon the undecked walls. Nor have mightier principalities disdained, in our day, to recognize the little republic. Among its archives are many communications from the several Italian governments, the late king of Spain, and the present king of France. Not long since, a prior being discovered manifesting a disposition to intrigue beyond his appropriate sphere, was bound, conducted to the confines and banished. The only organized force is the militia, who are bound to second the executive and judicial magistrates. The people, however, are distinguished for their probity and peaceful habits. Most of them are engaged in agriculture. The only peculiar trait observable among them, is an inflexible attachment to their peculiar institutions and an earnest spirit of freedom. But recently, an archbishop whose province of duty properly embraced two towns, one of which was San Marino, abandoned the latter in disgust, because he could not induce the people, on public ocasions, to salute him before their own rulers. Every half-year, they go in a body to the church, and deposite their vote for captains in a silvervase. The result of the election is made known at evening, and they accompany the successful candidate home, with torches. Before leaving the town, I ascended to the old castle. The walls command a most extensive and beautiful prospect, embracing the plains of Lombardy, a broad sweep of wild, undulating hills, the mountain of Ancona and the waters of the Adriatic. It was a delightful pastime to sit in the pleasant sunshine of autumn, and gazing from this little spot of free earth over such a landscape, let the imagination luxuriate amid the thrilling associations of the scene. We found but one occupant of the prison. The gate was opened by a pretty blue-eyed woman, the wife of the gaoler, who follows the trade of a cobbler in the belfry of one of the three towers. There is one horrid dungeon where a traitor priest suffered a long imprisonment; but the number of available cells is only three— which speaks well for the general character of the people. When, on our return, we reached the little bridge which divides the republican territory from Rimini, a venerable woman was leaning upon the parapet, her grey hair fluttering in the wind, in earnest conversation with a hardy stripling who stood at a short distance from her. He was a political fugitive who had found safety within the bounds of San Marino, and she was his mother just arrived from a town in the vicinity to visit him. The incident excited a pleasing train of reflections. San Marino has rendered no small service to the cause of liberty, by sheltering the many unfortunate victims of unsuccessful revolution. For such she has ever a welcome. The pope has been obliged to compromise with the republicans, by agreeing that refugees from his territory may travel unmolested for a certain period, with a passport from the authorities of San Marino. This arrangement has been eminently serviceable in protecting the persons and rights of the liberals, and excited much gratitude and respect towards the state. The setting sun gleamed upon the summit of the mountain, as I turned back to take a farewell glimpse of this little nestling-place of freedom. I remembered the contented and happy looks of the peasantry, and recalled the testimony they all so cordially bore to the superior privileges they enjoyed. I mused upon the remarkable preservation of that isolated spot amid the unhappy destinies of the land. I strove to impress the picturesque locality upon my memory; and pleased my heart with the thought that there was still one little green leaf in the withered crown of Italy. 6 TURIN. “Embosomed by the hills, whose forms around Stand sentinel'd with grandeur.” Anon. One of the circumstances which gives the traveller rather painful assurance of his approach to the northern confines of Italy, is that he finds himself once more ensconced within that most comfortless of all locomotives, except the lettiga of Sicily,—a Diligence. The straggling, untrimmed horses, and harlequin-looking postilions bobbing up and down most pitifully; the constant cracking of the whip, and the lurching and shivering of the clumsy fabric, are but the exterior graces which the vehicle boasts. At night, the roof within is often hung with baskets of provisions, and countless hats and bonnets which dangle most disturbingly in the face of the sleeping passenger; and when he has, at length, lost himself in a pleasant dream, and commenced an imaginary colloquy with some fair object left at the place of his last sojourn, a sudden jolt pitches him upon his neighbor, or an abrupt stoppage of the ponderous machine, rouses him to a sense of stiffened joints, yawing ostlers, and an execrating conducteur. It is, however, well that one leaving the dreamy atmosphere of the South, should be thus initiated into a more practical habit, and have the radiant mists of imagination dissipated from his brain. The Diligence is an excellent preparatory symbol of the more utilitarian regions and prosaic localities, towards which his pilgrimage tends. From the corner of one of these minature arks—despite the grumbling of an old lady by my side, the nap of whose lap dog I disturbed, and the angry chattering of a parrot, whose pendant cage was vibrating overhead—I succeeded, one afternoon, in withdrawing myself sufficiently, to look from the window over the surrounding fields. They presented a broad level plain, covered with fresh green grain, which a band of women, whose heads were enveloped in red cotton handkerchiefs, were assiduously reaping. The air was still, and the sky cloudy. A few trees, chiefly small poplars and mulberries, rose here and there along the road. And yet, meagre as was the natural scenery, it was a spot abounding in interest. Thirty-eight years before, it was the arena where contending armies battled for the possession of Italy, and men were mown down as the grain, then waving over their graves, fell beneath the sickles of the reapers. It was the plain of Marengo. Near yonder plantation of vines, Desaix took up his position. Across these fields the French line stretched imposingly away. And when the Austrians were so incautiously pursuing their success, it was in the midst of this now deserted level, that Napoleon met his brave ally, who, rushing forward at his bidding, met, almost immediately, his death. It was hence, too, that the brave Melas, then more than eighty years of age, considering the day won, and overcome with fatigue, retired to Alexandria, only to hear in a few hours, of his army's defeat. After this celebrated battle, Turin became the metropolis of the French department of the Po, and fourteen years after was restored to Sardinia. It is not surprising that the young mind of Alfieri was greatly impressed on entering this city. Its broad, clean streets radiating from a common centre; its airy arcades forming, like the passages of the French metropolis, most agreeable promenades, and its cheerful aspect may well captivate a stranger's eye. One scarcely realizes, at Turin, that he is within the precints of an Italian city. There is a modern look about the buildings, an elegance in the shops and caffés, and altogether an air of life and gayety, which brings Paris forcibly to mind. Indeed, the proximity of this capital to France, neutralizes, in no small degree, its Ausonian characteristics. The language is a mixture of French and Italian; and Goldoni found the taste here so strong for the French stage, that, during his visit to Turin, he composed his comedy of Moliere, to avail himself of the attraction of that author's name. There are few finer public squares in Europe than the Piazza del Castello, and no, more beautiful prospect of its kind than that from the church of La Superga, where the bones of the Sardinian kings repose. The small number of paupers, and the frequent instances of manly beauty among the military officers, are peculiarly striking. Sometimes, beneath the porches, a procession of nuns, poorly but neatly clad, is encountered, with garlands and tapers, headed by a fat priest chanting the burial service. The neighborhood of the Alps is disagreeably indicated by the number of women seen in the streets with goitres. They come, for the most part, from the base of Mt. Cenis and Susa, where this disease is very common, and still attributed by the common people, to the chill the throat constantly receives from the extreme coldness of the water. We are reminded of old Gonzalo's query in the Tempest:—`Who would believe that there were Mountaineers dew-lapp'd like bulls, whose throats had hanging at them wallets of flesh?' Turin is the coldest city in Italy. The circumadjacent mountains are scarcely ever entirely free from snow. As one looks upon them, frequently surmounted by variegated clouds, or, in dull weather, bathed with the yellow gleam of the struggling sunbeams playing on their white scalps, with here and there a dark streak where the snow has melted away, the appropriateness of the name of this section of Italy becomes more apparent—pie di monte—foot of the mountains. I found an unusual number of priests reading in the University library, and not a few peasants seated at the reading desks—a note-worthy and pleasant circumstance. It is interesting, when wandering about the precincts of this institution, to remember that it was the scene of that mis-education, of which Alfieri has drawn so vivid a picture in his autobiography. It was here that so many of his young days were wasted in wearisome sickness; where he was bribed or threatened into labors for his stupid 6* but powerful school mate; where he looked so long upon the adjacent theatre, which he was only allowed to enter five or six times a year, during carnival; and where he suffered so long from the tyranny of a capricious and pampered valet. In Turin, the stern tragedian first knew the sweet delights of poetry in his stolen and secret communion with Ariosto and Metastasio. Here he laid the foundation of those dissipated habits which, he had the rare moral courage to vanquish—suddenly vaulting from the low level of a life of pleasure, to the most determined and assiduous career that genius and industry ever achieved. Here, too, his ardent soul first experienced the delicious excitements of music, horsemanship, and love—those inspiring resources of his after years. The exhibition of the stranger's passport at Turin, is sufficient to introduce him to the Royal Gallery. It is interesting chiefly for its specimens of the Vandyck school—those expressive portraits which have so long formed the study of artists, and ever charmed that large portion of the curious who delight in observing the `human face divine.' There is one of Carlo Dolce's most characteristic Madonnas, full of the mildness, soft coloring, and timid execution which belong to his heads. That class of woman's admirers, who would fain make the standard of her attractiveness proportionate to the absence of any strong traits, should collect the female faces portrayed by this artist. A short time spent in contemplating such an array, would convince them of the absolute necessity of elevating their ideal of the sex, if they would have the spell of their graces perpetuated. But the picture which chains the attention in this gallery, is one of Murillo's master-pieces. Some of the biographers of the Spanish limner, seem to lament that his purpose of visiting Italy was never fulfilled. It would certainly be a cause of just regret, if the obscurity of his lot had doomed him for life, to paint nothing but banners for exportation, and fruit pieces for immediate sale; but since scope was given to his genius at the Escurial, and it was encouraged to a free and happy development at home, we cannot but deem it a happy destiny that prevented him from ever leaving his native country. There is no little error in the prevalent notion, that a true painter, so constituted by nature, is necessarily to improve by a visit to Italy. On the contrary, numerous instances might be cited, where such a course has been fatal to the individuality of the artist's style. His real force is thereby often sacrificed to a false manner. Servile imitation frequently supersedes originality. He ponders the works of the old masters too often, only to adopt certain of their peculiarities, instead of being quickened to put forth what is characteristic in himself. Such has, in many cases, been the result with regard to young votaries of art among us, who after giving certain proofs of talent, have gone abroad only to bring home an improved taste, perhaps, but not seldom a far inferior execution. Murillo was a genuine child of nature. He painted, as Goldsmith wrote, from individual inspiration. Who laments that his style is not so elevated as that of Raphael, nor so graceful as that of Correggio? If it were one or the other or both, he would not be Murillo. What we love in him, is his singular truth to nature—so fresh and vivid in expression—such a unity of coloring, such a semblance of life! When one stands before his Mother and Child, in the Palace at Florence, does it require much imagination, momentarily to fancy, that the infant is springing from the bosom of its mother into our arms? There is an almost perceptible motion in its posture, and a look of recognition in its eyes, that haunts us at every step. How often does the traveller in Italy—he who is wedded to that inexpressible charm in life, society and art, which we call nature—lament the paucity of Murillo's paintings! How often does he sigh for a journey into Spain, that he may behold more of them! The picture of which Turin boasts, represents Homer with the laurel wreath straggling round his head, as an improvisatore, and an amanuensis recording his song. The bard appears like a fresh portrait of one of those blind old men so often seen in southern Europe. The singular blandness of such countenances who has not noted? They wear a pensive, but peaceful expression, as if sweet thoughts were cheering their darkness. The light of poetry hovers round the brow. We feel that although bereft of vision, the bard sees. The deep things of life are unveiled to his inward gaze. And, then, how plainly the other figure listens! We soon cease to lament the blindness of the minstrel, in regretting that he is dumb. A son of Carlo Botta, the historian, follows the profession of an engraver in this capital. It is but recently that his justly renowned parent died in poverty at Paris. Five hundred copies of his works, in sheets, were given, as the only recompense in his power to afford, to the physicians who attended his wife in her last illness. This adds one more to the countless anecdotes illustrative of the melancholy lot of authors. But in this instance, the high merit and estimable qualities of the individual, enhance the pain with which every feeling mind must contemplate his fate. It would be a pleasing thought if we, the people of a free and prosperous land, had contributed to the comfort of one in his declining years, who, when in the full vigor of his intellect, devoted himself, most enthusiastically, to recording the history of our Revolution. The details of the war of independence are chiefly known on the continent through the history of Botta. No single work has served so effectually to establish the fame of that glorious event in the minds of Italians. One of the first questions they ask a comer from the New World is, if he has read La Guerra Americana by Carlo Botta? The work is a beautiful monument of the sympathy of one of the gifted of that nation in the cause of freedom; and happy would it have been, had our government added to the honorary title of citizen, the means of smoothing the venerable historian's passage to the grave. Another of his sons is travelling in Arabia, for the Jardin des Plantes. The father's last literary effort was a translation of a voyage round the world by an American captain, of whom this son was a companion. The latter is about publishing it, and the proceeds, with the hon rable name he boasts, will constitute his paternal heri age. I could not leave Turin, without seeing the author of Le Mie Prigioni. That beautiful and affecting record of human suffering has spread the name of Silvio Pellico over the civilized world. The despots of Europe have endeavored in vain to prevent its entrance into their territories; being well aware, that no harsh invectives against tyranny, no panegyrics in praise of free institutions, however eloquent and insidious, possess a tithe of the power to arouse men to a sense of their rights, which lives in such a calm and simple narrative of one of the victims of their cruelty. How many honest bosoms have glowed with indignation at the picture this amiable and gifted Italian has painted, of his tortures under the leads of a Venetian prison, and amid the cold walls of the Spielberg fortress! How many have admired the resources of intellect, philosophy, and affection, by which the unfortunate prisoner made even captivity captive! His correspondence with his fellow sufferer, his league of amity with his keeper, his reading, poems, and reveries—how do they shed a halo of moral brightness around the gloom of his dungeon! His hope deferred, his agonizing suspense, and, at length, his liberation and happy return to the bosom of his family—all related with so much truthfulness and feeling,—what an interest have they excited in behalf of the innocent object of such cruel persecution! Sharing this sentiment, I was not a little disappointed to find that Pellico was absent from the group of Piedmontese literati, who convene every evening at one of the caffés. An abbé, his friend, informed me, that the illuess of his father confined Silvio almost constantly at home. Every one remembers the deep affection with which he always alludes to his parents. I found that the strength of this sentiment was not exaggerated in his memoirs. His father was rapidly declining with age, and the son only left his bed-side for a few moments to breathe the fresh air. At one of these intervals, I paid him a visit. Pellico is now about thirty-eight years of age, small in stature, and wears glasses. His complexion is deadly pale, blanched by the blighting shadow of a dungeon. His brow is broad and high, and his expression serious and thoughtful. He was courteous and affable, spoke with deep emotion of his father, and seemed much gratified at the interest his work had excited in America. Notwithstanding the immense number of copies of Le Mie Prigioni which have been sold on the continent, and that it has been translated into so many languages, the author has derived no pecuniary benefit, except the two thousand francs he received from the original publisher at Turin. He is at present patrouized by a rich and liberal Marchesa, who has made him her librarian. He dines almost daily at her table, but resides with his parents. It must be confessed, that the sufferings of Pellico have, in no small measure, subdued his early enthusiasm. Some of the young advocates of liberal principles, in Italy, profess no little disappointment, that one who was so near becoming a martyr to their cause, should have turned derotee. They are displeased that Pellico should now only employ his pen upon Catholic hymns and religious odes. Such objectors seem not to consider the extent and severity of the trials to which the mind of the author has been exposed. They appear, too, to lose sight of the peril of his situation. It is only by retirement and quiet, that he can hope to enjoy in peace, the privilege of watching over and consoling the last years of his parents. Jealous eyes are ever upon him. Few are the spirits which would not be unnerved from their native buoyancy, by such a tragic experience as he has known; few the hearts that would not, at the close of such sufferings, fall back upon themselves, and cherish serenity as the great boon of existence. When I received his kindly-uttered buon viaggio, and followed his retreating figure as he went to resume his station by his father's bed-side, I could not but feel that the tyranny of Austria had not yet exhausted itself upon his nature—that his spirit had not wholly rebounded from the repression of despotism; but I felt, too, that he had nobly endured enough to deserve aniversal sympathy, and be wholly justified in applying to himself the sentiment of Milton: `They also serve who only stand and wait.' LOVE IN A LAZZARET. `The cell Haunted by love, the earliest oracle.' Byron. The surface of the sea assumed the crystalline quietude of a summer calm. The dangling sails flapped wearily; the sun slept with a fierce and dead heat upon the scorching deck; and even the thin line of smoke which rose from Stromboli, appeared fixed, like a light cloud, in the breezeless sky. I sought relief from the monotonous stillness and offensive glare, by noting my fellow passengers, who seemed to have caught the quiescent mood of surrounding nature, and resigned themselves to listlessness and silence. Delano was lolling upon a light settee, supporting his head upon his hand, and with half-closed eyes, thinking, I well knew, of the friends we had left, a few hours before, in Sicily. Of all Yankees I ever saw, my companion most rarely combined the desirable peculiarities of that unique race with the superadded graces of less inflexible natures. For native intellgence 7 and ready perception, for unflinching principle and manly sentiment, his equal is seldom encountered; but the idea of thrift, the eager sense of self-interest, and the iron bond of local prejudice, which too often disfigure the unalloyed New-England character, had been tempered to their just proportion, in his disposition, by the influence of travel and society. On the opposite side of the deck, sat a young lady, regarding with a half-painful, half devoted expression, a youth who was leaning against the companion-way, ever and anon glancing at the small yellow slippers that encased his feet, while he complacently arranged his luxuriant mustaches. These two were affianced; and by a brief observation of their mutual bearing, I soon inferred the history of the connection, and subsequent knowledge confirmed my conjecture. The Prince of — had paid his addresses to the eldest daughter of the Duke de Falco, with a view of replenishing his scanty purse; and by dint of some accomplishments and much plausibility, had succeeded not only in obtaining the promise of her hand, but in winning the priceless, but alas! unrecompensed boon of her affection. Often, in the course of our voyage, when I marked her sudden gaze of disappointment, as she sought in vain for a responsive glance from her betrothed, I could not but realize one fruitful source of that corruption of manners which characterizes the island of their birth. And not unfrequently, as I saw the parental pride and tenderness with which the old man caressed his children, have I wondered that he could ever bring himself to sacrifice their best happiness to ambitious designs. Yet the history of every European family abounds in such dark episodes. The daughters of the South open their eyes upon the fairest portion of the universe, and during the unsophisticated years of early youth, their affections, precociously developed by a genial clime and ardent temperament, become interested in the first being who appeals to their sympathies, or captivates their imagination. The claims of these feelings, the first and deepest of which they are conscious, if at all opposed to previous projects of personal aggrandizement, are scorned by their natural guardians. And yet when the warmest and richest attributes of their natures are thus unceremoniously sacrificed to some scheme of heartless policy, it is deemed wonderful that in the artificial society thus formed, principle and fidelity do not abide! What is so sacred in the estimation of youth, as a spontaneous sentiment? And when this is treated with cold sacrilege, what hallowed ground of the heart remains, on which Virtue can rear her indestructible temple? The elder children, however, are generally the victims of this convential system, and when its main object is accomplished, the others are often left to the exercise of their natural freedom. With this consoling reflection, I turned to the second sister, who was reading near by, under the shadow of a light umbrella, which a young Frenchman held over her head. Never were two countenances more in contrast, than those of the donna Paolina, and Monsieur Jacques. There were certain indications in the play of her mouth and expression of her eye, that, youthful as she was, the morning of her life had been familiar with some of those deep trials of feeling, the effect of which never wholly vanishes from the face of woman. His physiognomy evinced both intelligence and amiability, and yet one might study it for ever, and not feel that it was animated by a soul. Upon a mattress beneath the awning, her shoulders proped up by pillows, and her form covered with a silk cloak, reposed the youngest, and by far the most lovely, of the sisters. Angelica had seen but sixteen summers, notwithstanding the maturity of expression and manner so perceptible above the child-like demeanor of girlhood. Her dark hair lay half unloosed around one of the sweetest brows, and relieved the rich bloom of her complexion, as she dozed, unconscious of the admiring gaze of a Neapolitan officer, who stood at her feet. I had scarcely time to notice the exquisite contour of her features, when she started at an observation of her sister, and the smile and voice with which she replied, redoubled the silent enchantment of her beauty. At a distance from us all, as if to complete the variety of the party, stood an Englishman, whose folded arms and averted gaze sufficiently indicated that, for the time at least, he had enveloped himself in the forbidding mantle of his nation's reserve. At sunset, a fresh breeze sprang up, and the spirits of our little party rose beneath its invigorating breath. I have often had occasion to observe the admirable facility with which travellers in some parts of Europe assimilate. It always struck me as delightfully human. One may traverse the whole extent of the United States, and all the while feel himself a stranger. If a fellow traveller engage him in conversation, it is probably merely for the purpose of extracting information, satisfying curiosity, or ascertaining his opinions on politics or religion, objects so intrinsically selfish, that the very idea of them is sufficient to repel any thing like the cordial and frank interchange of feeling. This is perhaps one reason why our people have such a passion for rapid journeys. One of the chief pleasures of a pilgrimage is unknown to them; and it is not wonderful that men should wish to fly through that worst of solitudes, the desert of a crowd. In the old world, however, and especially in its southern regions, it is deemed but natural that those who are thrown together within the precincts of the same vessel or carriage, should maintain that kindly intercourse which so greatly enhances the pleasures and lessens the inconvenience of travel. In the present instance, a score of people were collected on board the same craft, and destined to pass several days in company, strangers to each other, yet alike endowed with common susceptibilities and wants; what truer philosophy than to meet freely on the arena of our common humanity? Fortunately, we had all been long enough abroad, to be prepared to adopt this course, and accordingly, it was interesting to remark, how soon we were at ease, and on the friendly footing of old acquaintances. There was a general emulation to be disinterested. One vied with the other in offices of courtesy; and even the incorrigible demon of the mal sur mer was speedily exorcised by the magic wand of sympathy. I was impressed, as I had often been before, by the fact that the claims of a foreigner seemed to be graduated, in the estimation of the natives, by the distance of his country. Delano and myself, when known to be Americans, soon became the special recipients of kindness; and the ten days at sea passed away like a few hours. We walked the deck, when it was sufficiently calm, with our fair companions, in friendly converse; and leaned over the side, at sun-set, to study the gorgeous cloud-pictures of the western sky. We traced together the beautiful scenery of the isles in the Bay of Naples, and the night air echoed with the chorus of our songs. And when blessed by the moonlight, which renders transcendant the beauty of these regions, our vigils were interrupted only by the rising sun. Even when the motion of the vessel interfered with our promenade, forming a snug circle under the lee, we beguiled many an evening with those gamesome trifles, so accordant with the Italian humor and vivacity. Two of these sports, I remember, were prolific occasions of mirth. The president appoints to each of the party a procuratore, or advocate, and then proposes certain queries or remarks to the different individuals. It is a law of the game, that no one shall reply, except through his advocate. But as the conversation becomes animated, it is more and more difficult to observe the rule; many are taken off their guard by the ingenuity of the president, and commit themselves by a gratuitous reply, or neglect of their clients, and are accordingly obliged to pay a forfeit. Another is called dressing the bride. The president assigns to all some profession or trade, and after a preliminary harangue, which affords abundant opportunity for the display of wit, calls upon his hearers to make a contribution to the bridal vestments, appropriate to their several occupations. As these are any thing but adapted to furnish such materials, the gifts are incongruous in the extreme; and the grotesque combination of apparel, thus united upon a single person, is irresistibly ludicrous. The point of the game is, to keep from laughing, which, from the ridiculous images and odd associations presented to the fancy, at the summing up of the bridal adornments, is next to impossible. The consequence is, a series of penances, which, by the ready invention of the leader, who is generally selected for his quick parts, in their turn augment the fun to which this curious game gives birth. On arriving at our destination, we were condemned to perform a quarantine of fourteen days, according to the absurd practice but too prevalent in Mediterranean ports. Seldom, however, are such annunciations so complacently received by voyagers wearied with the confinement of ship-board, and eager for the freedom and variety of the shore. In spite of the exclamations of disappointment which were uttered, it was easy to trace a certain contentment on many of the countenances of the group, the very reverse of that expression with which the unwilling prisoner surrenders himself to the pains of durance. The truth was, that for several days the intercourse of some of the younger of our party had been verging upon something more interesting than mere acquaintance. Angelica had fairly charmed more than one of the youthful spirits on board; and there was an evident unwillingness on their part to resign the contest, just as it had reached a significant point of interest. Being fond of acting the spectator, I had discovered a fund of quiet amusement in observing the little drama which was enacting, and nothing diverted me more than the apparent perfect unconsciousness of the actors that their by-play could be noted, and its motives discerned. My sympathies were naturally most warmly enlisted in behalf of poor Delano, notwithstanding that, after exhibiting the most incontestible symptoms of love, he had the assurance to affect anger toward me, because I detected meaning in his assiduous attentions to the little syren. The place of our confinement consisted of a paved square, or rather oblong, surrounded with stone buildings. Within the narrow limits of this court, were continually moving to and fro the occupants of the adjacent rooms, stepping about with the utmost caution, now and then starting at the approach of some fellow-prisoner, and crying largo! as the fear of contact suggested an indefinite prolongation of their imprisonment. Occasionally old acquaintances would chance to meet, and in the joy of mutual recognition, forget their situation, hasten toward each with extended hands, and perhaps be prevented from embracing only by the descending staff of the watchful guard. It was diverting to watch these manœuvres, through our grated windows; and every evening we failed not to be amused at the in-gathering, when the chief sentinel, armed with a long bamboo, made the circuit of the yards, and having collected us, often with no little difficulty, like so many stray sheep, ushered us with as much gravity as our sarcasms would permit, to our several quarters, and locked us up for the night. The variety of nations and individuals thus congregated within such narrow bounds, was another cause of diversion. Opposite our rooms, a celebrated prima donna sat all day at her embroidery, singing, sotto voce, the most familiar opera airs. Over the fence of the adjoining court, for hours in the afternoon, leaned a Spanish cavalier, one of the adherents of Don Carlos, whom misfortunes had driven into exile. A silent figure, in a Greek dress, lounged at the door beneath us, and at the extremity of the court, a Turk sat all the morning, in grave contemplation. With this personage we soon opened a parley in Italian, and I was fond of eliciting his ideas and marking his habits. He certainly deserved to be ranked among nature's philosophers. After breakfast, he regularly locked the door upon his wives, and took his station upon the stone seat, where, hour after hour, he would maintain so motionless a position, as to wear the semblance of an image in Eastern costume. His face was finely formed, and its serious aspect and dark mustaches were relieved by a quiet meekness of manner. He appeared to consider himself the passive creature of a higher power, and deemed it the part of true wisdom to fulfil the requisite functions of nature, and, for the rest, take things as they came, nor attempt to stem the tide of fate, except by imperturbable gravity, and perpetual smoking. He assured me that he considered this a beautiful world, but the Franks (as he called all Europeans,) made a vile place of it, by their wicked customs and silly bustle. According to his theory, the way to enjoy life, was to go through its appointed offices with tranquil dignity, make no exertion that could possibly be avoided, and repose quiescent upon the decrees of destiny. And yet Mustapha was not without his moral creed; and I have seldom known one revert to such requisitions with more sincere reverence, or follow their dictates with resolution so apparently invincible. `There is but one difference,' said he, `in our religion; the Supreme Being whom you designate as Deo, I call Allah. We take unto ourselves four wives, and we do so to make sure of the blessing for which you pray—not to be led into temptation.' Of all vices, he appeared to regard intemperance with the greatest disgust, and was evidently much pained to see the ladies of our party promenading the court unveiled. `Are your wives beautiful?' I inquired. `In my view,' he replied, `they are lovely, and that is sufficient.' I asked him if they resembled any of the ladies who frequented the walk. `It would be a sin,' he answered, `for me to gaze at them, and never having done so, I cannot judge.' In answer to my request that he would afford me an opportunity of forming my own opinion, by allowing me a sight of his wives. `Signor,' he said, with much solemnity, `when a Frank has once looked upon one of our women, she is no longer fit to be the wife of a Turk.' And he appears to have acted strictly upon this principle, for when the custode abruptly entered his room, as they were all seated at breakfast, Mustapha suddenly caught up the coverlid from the bed, and threw it over their heads. There is a law in physics, called the attraction of cohesion, by which the separate particles composing a body are kept together, till a more powerful agency draws them into greater masses. Upon somewhat such a principle, I suppose it was, that the parties convened in the Lazzaret, darting from one another in zig-zag lines, like insects on the surface of a pool, were brought into more intimate companionship, from being denied association with those around, except at a respectable distance, and under the strictest surveillance. Our company, at least, were soon established on the intimate terms of a family, and the indifferent observer could scarcely have augured from appearances, that we were but a knot of strangers, brought together by the vicissitudes of travelling. And now the spirit of gallantry began to exhibit itself anew; in the Neapolitan with passionate extravagance, in the Frenchman with studied courtesies, and in the Yankee with quiet earnestness. At dinner, the first day, the latter took care to keep in the back ground, till most of the party had selected seats, and then, seemingly by the merest accident, glided among the ladies, and secured a post between the two younger sisters. This successful manœuvre so offended the Englishman, that he retired from the field in high dudgeon, and never paid any farther attention to the fair Italians than what civility required. The remaining aspirants only carried on the contest more warmly. I was obliged almost momently to turn aside to conceal an irresistible smile at their labored politeness towards each other, and the show of indifference to the object of their devoirs, which each in turn assumed, when slightly discomfited. Nor could I wonder at the eagerness of the pursuit, as I beheld that lovely creature seated at her book, or work, in a simple but tasteful dress of white, and watched the play of a countenance in which extreme youth and modesty were blent in strangely sweet contrast with the repose of innocence, the vividness of talent, and beauty so rare and heart-touching. I could not, too, but wonder at the manner in which she received the attention of her admirers—a manner so amiable as to disarm jealousy, and so impartial as to baffle the acutest on-looker who strove to divine her real sentiments. There is a power of manner and expression peculiar to women, more potent and variable than any attribute vouchsafed to man; and were it not so often despoiled of its charm by affectation, we should more frequently feel its wonderful capacity. In the daughters of southren climes, at that age when `existence is all a feeling, not yet shaped into a thought,' it is often manifested in singular perfection, and never have I seen it more so than in Angelica. It was a lesson in the art of love, worthy of Ovidius himself, to mark the course of the rival three. Such ingenious tricks to secure her arm for the evening walk; such eager watching to obtain the vacant seat at her side; such countless expedients to arouse her mirth, amuse her with anecdote, or interest her in conversation; and such inexpressible triumph, when her eye beamed pleasantly upon the successful competitor! The Neapolitan cast burning glances of passion, whenever he could meet her gaze: quoted Petrarch, and soothed his hopeless moments by dark looks, intended to alarm his brother gallants, and awaken her pity. The Frenchman, on the contrary, was all smiles, constantly studying his toilet and attitude, and laboring, by the most graceful artifices, to fascinate the fancy of his ladylove. The Yankee evinced his admiration by an unassuming but unvarying devotion. If Angelica dropped her fan, he was ever the one to restore it; was the evening chill, he always thought of her shawl, and often his dinner grew cold upon his neglected plate, while he was attending to her wants. One day her album was circulated. Don Carlo, the Neapolitan, wrote a page of glowing protestations, asserting his inextinguishable love. Monsieur Jacques, in the neatest chirography, declared that the recent voyage had been the happiest of his life, and his present confinement more delightful than mountain liberty, in the company of so perfect a nymph. Delano simply declared, that the sweet virtues of Angelica sanctified her beauty to his memory and heart. There are some excellent creatures in this world, whose lives seem to conduce to every body's happiness but their own. Such an one was the donna Paolina. Affable and engaging, and with a clear and cultivated mind, she lacked the personal loveliness of her sisters, and yet rejoiced in it as if it were her own. No one could remain long in the society of the two, without perceiving that the confidence between them was perfect, and founded on that mutual adaptation which we but occasionally behold, even in the characters of those allied by the ties of a common parentage. To this kind-hearted girl I discovered that the lovers had separately applied for counsel and support in the prosecution of their suits. Don Carlo begged her to warn her sister against the advances of the Frenchman, as he knew him to be a thorough hypocrite; and Monsieur Jacques returned the compliment, by assuring 8 her that the Neapolitan was by no means sufficiently refined and accomplished to be the companion of so delicate a creature as Angelica. Young Jonathan, with a more manly policy, so won the esteem of Paolina, by dwelling upon the excellencies of her sister, that she became his unwavering advocate. I confess that as the appointed period of durance drew to a close, I began to feel anxious as to the result of all this dallying with the tender passion. I saw that Monsieur was essentially selfish in his suit, and that vanity was its basis. It was evident that the Neapolitan was stimulated by one of those ardent and sudden partialities, which are as capricious as the flashes of a volcano, and often as temporary. In truth, there was not enough of the spirit of sacrifice, or vital attachment, in their love, to warrant the happiness of the gentle being whose outward charms alone had captivated their senses. Delano, I knew, was sincere, and my fears were, that his future peace was involved in the result. At length the last evening of our quarantine had arrived. Mons. Jacques had played over, as usual, all her favorite airs on his guitar, and Carlo had just fervently recited a glowing passage from some Italian poet, descriptive of a lover's despair, when sunset, playing through the bars of our window, reminded us that the cool hour of the day was at hand, when it was our custom to walk in the outer court. As we went forth, there was that eloquently sad silence, with which even the most thoughtless engage in an habitual employment for the last time. No one anticipated me in securing the companionship of the sweet child of nature, whose beauty and gentleness had brightened to us all, so many days of pilgrimage and confinement; and I determined to improve it, by ascertaining, if possible, the probable success of my poor friend. I spoke of the many pleasant hours we had passed together, of that social sympathy which had cheered and consoled, and asked her if even those narrow walls would not be left with regret. `Consider,' said I, `you will no more be charmed with the exquisite elegance of Monsieur Jacques'—she looked up to see if I really thought her capable of being interested by such conventional graces— `or be enlivened,' I continued, `by the enthusiastic converse of Don Carlo'—she smiled—`or know,' I added, with a more serious and searching glance, `the affectionate and gifted society of Delano'—a tear filled her eye, but the smile assumed a brighter meaning. I looked up, and he was before us, gazing from one to the other, with an expression of joyful inquiry, which flashed the happiest conviction on my mind. The passionate Neapolitan had flattered, and the genteel Frenchman had amused, but the faithful Yankee had won the heart of Angelica De Falco. FLORENCE REVISITED. “Florence, beneath the sun Of cities, fairest one.” Shelley. We had been riding all night along the Arno, whose turgid waters were shrunk to half their usual dimensions, by the intense heat of midsummer. Dawn was gradually unveiling the heavens, and spreading a soft, silvery light over the landscape, as we drew near the termination of our journey. The vines, by the road-side, stirred cheerfully in the morning breeze, and as one after another of their broad leaves was uplifted, the mossy boughs of the mulberry trees upon which they are festooned, were momentarily revealed, brightened by the grateful dew. The full grain beneath them, bowed by its own weight, glistened with the same moisture, condensed in chrystals upon its bended tops; and to vary the rich carpet so lavishly spread over the earth, a patch of lupens or artichokes, occasionally appeared, from amid which, rose the low, grey olive, or thin poplar of Tuscany. Sometimes a few dwarfed pines indicated the site of ancient woods, long since extirpated by the genius of Agriculture, or some remnant of an ancient wall marked the old feudal boundaries of the landholders. A still more interesting memorial of those times exists farther back, in the shape of a picturesque tower, celebrated on account of its having been taken by a curious stratagem. Lights were appended to the horns of a flock of goats, which, in the night, appeared like an army, and frightened away the hesieged. Early as was the hour, a large group of poor women, spinning flax, were awaiting at the gate of a villa, the customary alms of its proprietor; and often a bend in the river brought us in view of several men dragging a heavily laden barge through its narrow channel. As the day broke, we came in sight of Florence. The mighty dome of its cathedral—that noble monument of the genius of Brunelleschi, and the graceful tower by its side, rose from the mass of dense buildings, like a warrior of the middle ages, and a fair devotee of some more peaceful epoch, standing in the centre, to guard and hallow the city. Far around the walls, spread the hills with a fertile beauty and protecting grace, and through the midst wound the Arno, gleaming in the morning sun. It is a curious feeling— that with which we revisit an Italian city, familiar and endeared to our memory. There are none of those striking local changes, which startle the absentee on his return to the New World. The outward scene is the same; but what revolutions may not his own feelings have undergone, since he last beheld it! How may experience have subdued enthusiasm, and suffering chastened hope! 8* Will the solemn beauty of the church wherein he was wont to lose himself in holy musing, beguile him, as of old, to meditative joy? Will the picture before which he so often stood, wrapt in admiration, awaken his heart as before? Will the calm beauty of the favorite statue once more soothe his impatient soul? Will the rich and moving strain for which he has so long thirsted, ever thrill as when it first fell upon his ear? And `the old, familiar faces'—have a few years passed them by untouched? In such a reverie I went forth to revive the associations of Florence. The dreamy atmosphere of a warm and cloudy day accorded with the pensive delight with which I retraced scenes unexpectedly revisited. Many botanical specimens were added to the unrivalled wax collection at the museum, and several new tables, bright with chalcedony, amethyst and pearl, were visible at the Pietra dura manufactory. The old priest, whose serene temper seemed a charm against the encroachments of age, had lost something of his rotundity of visage, and his hair was blanched to a more snowy whiteness. A shade of care was evident upon the brow of the man of pleasure, and his reckless air and contracted establishment most strikingly indicated the reduced state of his resources. The flower-girl moved with less sprightliness, and the dazzling beauty of the belle was subdued to the calm grace of womanhood. The artist whom I left toiling in obscurity had received the reward of his self devotion; fame and fortune had crowned his labors. The beggar at the corner looked as unchanged as a picture, but his moan of supplication had sunk a key lower. The waiter at the caffe maintained his accustomed swagger, and promotion had cooled the earnest promptitude which distinguished his noviciate. Three new chain bridges span Arno; being painted white, and supported by massive pillars of granite, surmounted by marble sphinxes, their appearance is very pleasing. The one below the Ponte Vecchio, serves as a fine foreground object in the landscape formed by the adjacent hills; and the other embellishes the vista through which we gaze down the river to the far-off mountains and woods of the Cascine. Utilitarianism is rapidly penetrating even into Tuscany. Demidorff's elegant villa is transformed into a silk manufactory; and a railroad is projected between Florence and Leghorn. With the same stolid dignity rose the massive walls of the Pitti and Strozzi palaces, wearing as undaunted an aspect as when the standards of the ancient factions floated from the iron rings still riveted to their walls. The lofty firs and oaks of the public walk waved in undiminished luxuriance; and the pheasants flitted as lightly over the lawn. The curious tower of the Palazzo Vecchio was relieved with the same vivid outline in the twilight; and the crowd pressed as confusedly through the narrow limits of the Via Calziole. The throng promenade as gaily as ever along the river-side, on the evening of a festival,—the stately peasant-girl, with her finely-wrought hat—the strutting footman—the dark-robbed priest—the cheerful stranger, and the loitering artist. The street-musicians gather little audiences as formerly; and the evening bells invade the air with their wonted chime. The most interesting of Greenough's recent productions, is an ideal female head—Heloise, illustrative of Pope's well-known lines:— “Dear, fatal name! rest ever unrevealed Nor pass these lips in holy silence sealed; Hide it, my heart, within that close disguise Where, join'd with God's, his loved idea lies.” Another American sculptor has recently taken up his residence in Florence, whose labors seem destined to reflect great honor upon his country. Hiram Powers is one of those artists whose vocation is ordained by native endowments. Amid the vicissitudes of his early life, the faculty, so strong within him, found but occasional and limited development: yet was it never wholly dormant. Powers derives his principles of art directly from the only legitimate source—Nature. His recent busts are instinct with life and reality. They combine the utmost fidelity in detail with the best general effect. They abound in expression and truth. His success in this department, has given occasion to so many engagements for busts, that time has scarcely been afforded him for any enterprize of a purely ideal character. He is now about to embody a fine conception from Gesner's Death of Abel. He intends making a statue of Eve at the moment when after her expulsion from Paradise, the sight of a dead bird first revealed to her the nature of death. “It is I! It is I! Unhappy that I am, who have brought misery and grief on every creature! For my sin, these pretty, harmless animals are punished.” Her tears redoubled. “What an event! How stiff and cold it is! It has neither voice nor motion; its joints no longer bend; its limbs refuse their office. Speak Adam, is this death?' Florence may appear, at a casual view, comparatively deficient in local associations; yet few cities are more impressed by the facts of their history. It was during the middle ages that it rose to power, and that violent era has left its memorials behind. The architecture is more remarkable for strength than elegance, and its beauty is that of simplicity and dignity. Of this, the Pitti and Strozzi palaces are striking examples. In whatever direction one wanders, memorials of departed ages meet the view, less numerous and imposing than at Rome, but still sufficiently so to awaken the sweet though melancholy charm of antiquity. Every day, in walking to the Cascine, the stranger passes the house where Amerigo Vespuccio was born; and as he glances at the hospital of Santa Maria Nuova, he remembers that it was founded by the father of Dante's Beatrice. The sight of Galileo's tower, near the Roman gate, recalls that scene of deep, moral and dramatic interest, when the philosopher, having, on his knees, renounced his theory of the earth's motion, before the tribunal of Rome, suddenly sprung to his feet and exclaimed, “E pur si muove!”—`and yet it moves.' The villa of Boccacio, in the environs, awakens the awful associations of the plague as well as the beauty of the Decameron; and a stroll around the walls, by bringing in view the old fortifications, will revive some of the scenes of the celebrated siege of eleven months, in 1530. The heroism exhibited by the Florentines at this period of privation and suffering, renders it one of the brightest pages of their annals. Many a maiden cast herself from the balcony to escape the brutal soldiery; and one woman who had been forcibly carried away by an officer, stole from the camp at night, collected all his spoils, and mounting hishorse, rode back to Florence, with a new dowry for her husband. Let the stranger who would excite the local associations of the Tuscan capital, stroll into the Piazza Grand Duca on a spring morning. Yonder is a crowd of applicants at the grated windows of the post office; here a line of venders, vociferating the price of their paltry wares; and there a score of porters at work about the custom-house. In the centre is an eloquent quack, mounted upon an open barouche, and surrounded by vials, plasters and surgical instruments, waving a long string of certificates, and loudly expounding the virtues of his specifics to a group of gaping peasants. At the portal of yonder palace, an English equipage is standing, while its master is negotiating with Fenzi, the banker, within. People are passing and re-passing through the spacious area, or chatting in small groups. In the midst is the bronze, equestrian statue of Cosmo, and near it, the fountain exhibiting a colossal figure of Neptune. This remarkable public square is not less striking as a witness of the past than from its present interest. The irregular design of the Palazzo Veccho, is attributed to the public animosities of the period of its erection; and the open space which now constitutes the Piazza, was formed by the destruction of the houses of the Uberti family, and others of the same faction, that the palace of the Priors might not stand on what was deemed accursed ground. Another scene associated with one of the most tragic events in the history of Florence, is the Duomo—that huge pile so richly encrusted with black and white marble, which was commenced towards the close of the twelfth-century. As one, in any degree susceptible to the influence of superstition, wanders, at twilight, through the vast and dusky precincts of this cathedral, vague and startling fancies will often throng upon his mind. As he slowly paces the marble floor towards the main altar, perhaps some mendicant glides from a dark recess, with a low moan of entreaty, or an aged female form, bowed at one of the shrines, is dimly descried in the gloom. The only light streams through the lofty and richly-painted windows. The few busts of the illustrious of by-gone days, are scarcely discernible; the letters on the sepulchral tablets are blurred in the twilight, and the dust-covered banners, trophies of valor displayed in the Holy Land, hang in shadowy folds. At that pensive hour, in the solitude of so extensive a building, surrounded by the symbols of Death and Religion, how vividly rises to the imagination the sanguinary deed perpetrated before that altar! The conspiracy of the Pazzi forms the subject of one of Alfieri's tragedies; and a very spirited illustration of one of the scenes was recently exhibited in Florence, the production of a promising young artist. It represents the wife of Francesco kneeling at his feet and endeavoring to prevent his leaving the house at the appointed signal. At the head of the plot was Sixtus IV., whose principal agent, Salviati, concerted with the Pazzi to execute their purpose at a dinner given by Lorenzo de Medici, at Fiesole; but in consequence of his brother's absence, the scene of action was transferred to the church. On the 26th of April, 1478, the day appointed, it appears the service commenced without the presence of Guliano de Medici. Francesco Pazzi and Bandini went in search of him. They not only accompanied him in the most friendly manner to the cathedral, but in order to ascertain if he wore concealed weapons, threw their arms caressingly about him as they walked, and took their places by his side, before the altar. When the bell rung—the signal agreed upon, and the priest raised the consecrated wafer, as the people bent their heads before it, Bandini plunged a dagger into the breast of Giuliano. Francesco Pazzi then rushed upon him and stabbed him in many places, with such fury that he wounded himself in the struggle. Lorenzo defended himself successfully against the priest who was to have taken his life, and received but a slight wound. His friends rallied around him, and they retreated to the sacristy, where one of the young men, thinking the weapon which had injured Lorenzo might have been poisoned, sucked the wound. The conspirators having so completely failed, were soon identified, and the leaders executed, while Lorenzo's escape was hailed with acclamations by the people. On a calm, summer night, as one walks up the deserted and spacious area of the Via Larga, he may watch the moonbeams as they play upon the beautiful cornice of the Palazzo Ricardi, and recall, as a contrast to the peaceful scene, another bloody deed in the chronicles of the house of Medici. It was to this princely dwelling that the nephew of Allessandro, first Duke of Florence, commonly called Lorenzino, ambitious of power, lured his profligate uncle, and having invited him to repose, and placed his sword with the belt twisted firmly round the hilt, upon the bolster, stole out and brought a bravo to dispatch him. The assassination, however, proved difficult, and the treacherous relative was obliged, personally, to join in the butchery. He dipped his finger in the blood of his kinsman, and wrote upon the wall of the room, the line from Virgil— “Vincit Amor Patriæ, laudumque immensa cupido.” Although the presumptive heir of Alessandro, he fled, and after ten years of exile, fell, himself, beneath an assassin's dagger at Venice. Among the numerous hills of the Appenine range surrounding Florence, Fiesole is conspicuous from its picturesque appearance. It is surmounted by a row of cypresses, and upon its summit stands an ancient convent. From the green and shady esplanade before this building, is obtainable one of the best views of the city and its environs; and the traveller who possesses any taste for scenery will not regret his three miles walk from the Porta Pinta, or the somewhat precipitous ascent which brings him to so commanding an observatory. Upon this mountain stood a celebrated Etruscan fortress. It was one of Cataline's strong-holds; and the traces of its walls are still discernible. From this spot the founders of Florence descended to the borders of the Arno, and 9 there established their dwellings. Originally, the whole city occupied the right bank of the river, and boasted but one bridge outside the walls, which is still called Ponte Vecchio. It is believed that the abundance of lilies and other flowers (fiori) which flourished there, gave its name to the metropolis of Tuscany, although Cellini declares it to have been derived from Florentius, a celebrated general. It is remarkable that the first use the people made of arms, was to turn them against the spot of their origin. The republic was well established about the close of the twelfth century. The population were early devoted to manufactures, particularly of cloth. The first magistrates were denominated consuls; afterwards, the office of mayor was instituted, and it was decreed that the incumbent should be a foreigner, that no ties of relationship might interfere with the impartial discharge of his duties. Another condition was attached to the situation which would scarcely be deemed expedient in our own times—that the mayor should never give nor accept dinners. Subsequently, the title was changed to that of gonfaliere, or standard-bearer, whose functions, at different times, were variously modified. Besides the consuls, there were priors of the arts and trades, senators—ten buonuomini, etc. The Florentines first learned the art of war in numerous conflicts with feudal lords, who made incursions from neighboring castles located amid the fastnesses of the mountains, and strongly fortified. A civil feud, however, which gave birth to an infinite series of long and bloody animosities, soon succeeded these paltry and irregular enterprises. This fatal discord was excited by female beauty, which seems to have been one of the most prolific occasions of ancient dissensions, as influential, in those troubled times, in nerving the warrior, as it has been, in every age, in calling forth the richest strains of the bard. The youthful head of the wealthy and powerful family of Buondelmonte had promised to marry a daughter of the house of Amidei, equally renowned and powerful. The charms of another lady, one of the Donati, also one of the first rank, beguiled the accomplished cavalier from his first love; and, unmindful of former vows, he married the object of his new attachment. The family of the deserted bride considered their dignity compromised by this act, and on Easter Sunday, while Boundelmonte, dressed in white, and mounted upon a white horse, was riding from the other side of the Arno, towards the house of the Amidei, passing over the old bridge, they made an attack near the statue of Mars, and killed him. This murder threw the whole city into confusion, and the people, almost immediately, were divided into two parties. The citizens barricaded the roads, and fought in the streets and squares, and from the houses and turrets. Soon after this event, ensued the political warfare between the Guelphs, and Ghibelines, the former attaching themselves to the Buondelmonte, and the latter, to the Uberti—the most powerful family of the party, which became its head, instead of the Amedei. The people constantly vacillating between interest and enmity, alternately fought and made truces, till a quarrel with Pisa, for a time, diverted their arms. This rival colony undertook to stop the goods from Florence, as they came down the river. They were not, however, so good fighters on land as at sea, and were finally defeated by the Florentines, at Castel del Bosco. This war of inroads, however, lasted six years, and was, at length, adjusted by a cardinal. The old, intestine controversy was soon renewed with increased ardor, and when the Ghibelines remained masters of the city, for want of any better way of wreaking vengeance upon the Guelphs, they razed their dwellings, demolished numerous towers, and even made a barbarous attempt to destroy the temple of St. John, now called the Baptistery, because their opponents had once held meetings there. A beautiful tower stood at the commencement of the street of the Adimari, and this they endeavored to make fall upon the temple by placing rafters against the opposite part, cutting away the other side, and then setting fire to the props. Happily, however, the tower fell in another direction. For a series of years, the arms of the Florentines were constantly exercised, with various success, in wars against the Pisans, Lucchese, Arentines, etc., but, ever and anon, this original and fierce civil feud usurped all their energies. Its history is one of the remarkable evidences of the spirit of that age, and hereafter, as the sounds of warfare and violence die away into the past, before the mild influences of Christianity, it will be reverted to by the philosopher as a fertile source of illustration. Its consequences and incidental results are numerous and interesting. The Ghibelines were generally triumphant in Florence. In 1261, when Count Guido Novella was elected mayor, in order to introduce his people more easily from Casentino, into the city and palace, he opened a new gate in the nearest walls, and the avenue leading thence, is still called the street of the Ghibelines. In the annals of these celebrated factions, we find now one, and now another invoking foreign aid. Sometimes a respite occurs of so long a continuance, as to induce a belief that the demon of discord is at length laid asleep, and anon it breaks forth with tenfold fury. At one moment, the Pope's interposition procures peace, and the next, some incident, trifling in itself, suddenly revives the flame of party rage. After a solemn reconciliation had apparently settled the dissension at Florence, it was again renewed in Pistoia, a few miles off. A certain Ser Cancelliere of that city was the father of a very numerous family, the progeny of two wives, both of whom belonged to noble houses. Between the descendants of these rival mothers, a strong jealousy existed; and under the name of Black and White chancellors, (Bianci and Neri) more than a hundred individuals were included in the quarrel, among whom, not less than eighteen, were chevaliers or knights of the golden spur. Some young men of both parties, having quarrelled over their wine, one of the Neri received a blow from Charles Walfred, of the opposite faction. In the evening, the aggrieved individual waylaid the brother of his insulter, and having beaten him, so mutilated one of his hands, that only the forefinger remained. This aggression roused an universal spirit of resentment on the part of the Bianci. The opposite party vainly attempted to make peace; and the inflictor of the injury, on repairing to Walfred's house, 9* to apologize, was seized and taken into the stables, when one of his hands was cut off by way of retaliation, and he was sent back to his partisans. This act rendered all further attempts at treaty vain. Thenceforth, street-broils, of the fiercest character, were of constant occurrence. Some of the most guilty repaired to Florence, and there fomented the old feud, the Bianci inciting the Ghibelines, and the Neri the Guelphs. In 1301, Charles of Valois, invited by Boniface VIII, into Italy, secretly concerted with him the ruin of the Bianci party. The Neri were then dominant. In consequence of the violence committed under Corso Donati, the Pope had sent one of his cardinals to Florence to bring about peace, but the efforts of the prelate were vain. On Christmas day, the son of Corso Donati, being on horseback in the square of Santa Croce, and seeing Nicholas of the Cerchia family pass by, ran after him out of one of the gates. A contest ensued, in which both were killed, and, in consequence, civil war once more kindled. At length, on the second of April, the remainder of the Bianci party, among whom were Dante and Petrucco of Parengo, the father of Petrarch, were banished. The Neri threw fireworks upon the houses and shops of their discomfitted opponents, near the Mercato Nuovo, which, taking fire, produced extensive destruction, and reduced many to poverty. In 1310, the New German Emperor, Henry VII., prepared to descend into Italy. Many cities invited him. In Tuscany, Pisa and Arrezzo, alone desired his arrival. The following year, Dante, in behalf of the Ghibeline party, wrote him, earnestly, to come down upon Florence. This letter sealed the poet's fate; and four years after, his exile was again confirmed. Received openly at Pisa, and crowned at Rome, Henry approached and besieged Florence, but after a wearisome delay before the walls, and several fruitless skirmishes, he fell sick, and on the last night of October, 1813, abandoned the attempt to the glory of the city. He soon after died at St. Salvi, and these eras of violence and war were soon succeeded by a brilliant period of literature and art. The mausoleum of the Medici, against the extravagant splendor of which, Byron utters so earnest a satire, is now far advanced towards completion. It is an octagon, lined with the richest marble and most precious stones. As the curious visitor inspects the gorgeous monument, how various and conflicting are the associations inspired by the thought of the renowned family it celebrates. Their redeeming characteristics were taste and liberality. They promoted the progress of humanity by rewarding the exertions of genius, rather than by a generous philanthropy. The mass were as much cajoled and subjected, as under more warlike princes; but the gifted received encouragement, and were urged to high endeavor. The annals of the house of Medici abound in scenes, at one moment exciting warm admiration, and the next, unbounded disgust. One instant we kindle at the refined and enthusiastic taste of Lorenzo, and the next, are revolted at some act of petty tyranny. Now we see genius unfold with brilliant success beneath the fostering rays of patronage; and the next, injustice, conspiracy, or revenge, degrades the chronicle. The patriotic Cosmo, ardently listening to the doctrines of Plato, Lorenzo, the Magnificent, chatting with a young sculptor in his garden, the dissipated and cunning Giovanni, the imbecile Piero, the perfidious Lorenzino, and the cruel Catharine, pass before us in startling contrast. Yet as we behold the works to which the redeemers of the name have given rise, and trace the splendid results of wealth dedicated to the cause of taste, we feel their mission on the earth was one, the intellectual fruits of which are inestimable and progressive. The origin of the Medici family has been romantically referred to Averardo de Medici, a commander under Charlemagne. The first authentic mention of this celebrated race seems, however, to indicate Filippo as one of the earliest founders. Toward the middle of the thirteenth century, the Guelphs having obtained the chief authority in Florence, Filippo, oppressed by the Ghibelines, fled from Fiorano, in the valley of Mugello, to the Tuscan capital, which, thenceforth, became his country. In 1348, we read of Francesco de Medici, as the head of the magistracy, although prevented by the plague from exercising his functions. Filippo left two sons, Bicci and Giovanni. To the latter succeeded Cosmo, and with his name began the renown of the house. The world was but just emerging from barbarism when this prince commenced his sway. Although exiled by a faction, his absence was deeply regretted, and his return triumphantly hailed. Cosmo invited numerous Greek refugees to settle on the banks of the Arno. Through them, a new interest was awakened in ancient literature; classical studies revived, and manuscripts were eagerly sought. While the council of Florence were employed in barren theological disputes, Cosmo was listening to Gemisthus Pletho, and planning a Platonic academy. Among the illustrious Greeks whom he befriended, was Agyropylus. `My son,' said he, leaning over the cradle of one of his children, `if you were born to be happy, you will have Agyropylus for your preceptor.' Cosmo was succeeded by Piero, who had previously married the wealthy Contessina Bardi. His authority was near being overturned by a conspiracy, headed by the Pitti family, who, in the end, were obliged to flee, leaving their superb palace unfinished. Piero left two sons, Lorenzo and Giuliano. The brilliant career of the former has been made familiar by the elaborate and, perhaps flattered portrait of Roscoe. That this magnificent prince was a man of more than ordinary abilities, is sufficiently proved by the address exhibited on his youthful embassy to Ferdinand of Naples, as well as by the numerous specimens extant of his poetical talents. But no small portion of his renown is to be ascribed simply to his immense wealth and exalted station. He was a man of elegant taste, rather than of extraordinary genius; and merits applause for his liberal patronage of literature and the arts, more than for any example he has bequeathed of intellectual or moral power. He renewed and prolonged the impulse his father had given to the cause of civilization. The visitor is continually reminded of the obligations of Florence to Lorenzo. He established a school of sculpture, greatly enriched the Laurentian library, improved architecture, promoted the study of philosophy, and revived the art of the lapidary. His life was passed in the midst of men distinguished for genius and acquirements, whom his magnificent taste had gathered around him. His time was occupied in supervising local improvements, cheering native genius, collecting rare manuscripts and medals, cultivating philosophy, studying politics, making love, discussing poetry with Politiano, and writing sonnets. He demonstrated that a prince could find ample employment, and attain true glory without recourse to conquest. He proved that there were more enduring monuments than those which rise from the battle-field. His name is associated with works of art and literary productions, as indissolubly as those of their authors, and although he only lived to the age of forty-four, he expired tranquilly in the midst of his friends. His death was deemed a national misfortune, and seems to have been the precursor of innumerable woes to Italy. Giovanni, son of Lorenzo, was an archbishop at ten, and a cardinal at fourteen—the youngest person ever raised to that rank. A letter still extant, addressed by his father to him at Rome, evinces how much at heart he held his advancement. After the death of Piero, Giovanni became the head of the family; and all his wishes centered in the hope of reviving its influence, which had again suffered a serious interruption. This feeling he prudently concealed for some time. After the battle of Ravenna, three young men, resolute friends of the Medici, went to the Gonfaliere, and, with their daggers at his throat, forced Soderini to resign. The Medici being thus restored, Giovanni was made Pope, under the title of Leo X. His pontificate is celebrated as a period when letters and the arts flourished to an unparalleled degree. Previous circumstances, however, had prepared the way for the many brilliant results of that remarkable epoch. The sale of indulgences, and other church abuses, were then carried to the highest point; and the protests against ecclesiastical tyranny commenced, which ushered in the reformation. Cosmo, Francesco and Ferdinand, maintained something of the liberal and tasteful spirit of their ancestors. But under Ferdinand II., who, in 1621, came to the government, at the age of eleven, the aspect of affairs changed. Extravagant expenditures drained the state of its resources, and when Cosmo III., died, after a reign of fifty-three years, Tuscany was reduced to a most deplorable state, oppressed with a heavy national debt, and exhausted by taxes. Fortunately for the country, John Gaston was the last of his family, once so glorious, but now so sadly degenerated. He died after an indifferent rule, and in accordance with the terms of peace with Vienna (1735) left his duchy to the house of Lorraine. Francis Stephen, Duke of Lorraine, and Grand Duke of Tuscany, made a contract with John Gaston's sister—the last of the name of Medici, by which he acquired the various allodial possessions collected by her ancestors. Under the twenty-six years of the sway of his son Leopold, Tuscany recovered from a decline that had lasted more than a century. He encouraged commerce, agriculture and manufactures, established penitentiaries, abolished the inquisition, and proclaimed a new criminal code. His financial administration was admirable, and his own manner of life extremely simple. The traveller in Italy still recognizes the happy influences of his regenerating rule. Nor has the effect of his noble example been contravened by his successor. An air of contentment, and a feeling of safety continues to distinguish Tuscany, and render it the favourite sojourn of the stranger. Even the comparative severity of the climate in winter, aggravated by the tramontana which sweeps so coldly from the mountains, seldom drives the foreign sojourners to more genial localities. It is not, perhaps, without reason, that the distinguished literary rank which Florence holds in Italian history, has been ascribed to its inferior climate. There is something almost oppressive to the senses, and confusing to the mind, in the immense collections of paintings in Italy. The stranger, especially if his time is limited, and his eagerness for knowledge and true impressions, a delicate and discriminating, as well as an earnest passion, will not unfrequently regret the number and variety of interesting objects which at once demand his attention. A scene of natural grandeur or beauty seldom distracts the eye with the variety of its features. The mountain range which girdles the prospect, the grove which waves above the cliff, the river flowing through the vale, the flowers on its banks, and the rich cloud-land above, are harmonized to the view, reposing beneath the same light, and stirred by a common air. But each work of art has a distinctive character. It is a memorial of an individual mind. It demands undivided attention. Hence, the first visit to a museum of art is almost invariably unsatisfactory. We instinctively wish that the array were not so imposing. Many a sweet countenance, whose expression haunts us like a dream, we vainly endeavor to recall; many a group we would fain transfer to our own apartment, that there we might leisurely survey its excellencies, and grow familiar with its spirit. There are few public galleries which are less objectionable, on this account, than that of Florence. When we have paused in the vestibule long enough to recover breath after ascending the long flight of stairs, and inspect the specimens of statuary there arranged, the first paintings which meet our gaze, on entering, are of an early date. The stiff execution brings to mind the Chinese style, and indicates a primitive epoch in the history of art. The arabesques on the ceiling, the portraits immediately beneath it, and the range of ancient busts below, fill, without dazzling the eye. As we pass on, the interest increases at every step. There is a gradual growth of attraction. Curiosity is soon absorbed in a deeper sentiment. Alternately we stand smiling before some graphic product of the Dutch pencil, wrapt in a speculative reverie over an obscure painting, or seated, at last, quite absorbed in admiration within the hallowed precincts of the Tribune. The perfect freedom of entrance and observation, unannoyed by the jargon of a cicerone, doubtless adds to the pleasure of a visit to the Florence collections. And the heart is not less gratified than the eye, when we behold one of the sunburnt conladini improving a spare hour on market-days, to loiter in the gallery, or 10 turns from a miracle of art to the happy countenance of some foreign painter, as he stands before his easel, intent upon copying a favorite original. The most unique feature in the collections of which this city boasts, however, is doubtless the gallery of portraits of celebrated painters, chiefly by themselves. How interesting to turn from the immortal products of the pencil, to the lineaments of the artist! Raphael's sweet countenance, eloquent with the refined beauty which distinguishes his works, and subdued by something of the melancholy associated with his early death; Perugino, his master; Leonardo da Vinci, who first developed the principles of that progress in art, which was perfected during the fifteenth century, who so earnestly and successfully devoted his life to the advancement of his favorite pursuit, and died in the arms of his royal patron; Salvator Rosa, the poet, musician and painter, recognised by his half savage aspect, who so delighted in scenes of gloomy grandeur, and studied nature with such enthusiasm amid the wilds of the Appenines;— all, in short, of that glorious phalanx, whose best monuments are their works. The bronze statue of Perseus, under the allogii of the gallery, reminds the passer of one of the most remarkable characters to which Florence has given birth. Born on the night of All Saints' day, Cellini assures us he was rapturously welcomed to the world by his father, who, as if anticipating his future celebrity, instantly greeted him as Benvenuto. Like Salvator Rosa, music, at first, disputed the empire of his mind with the other arts, and his remarkable performance on the flute, was the primary occasion of attracting towards him attention and patronage. Indeed, the artist's father most pertinaciously fixed all his hopes for young Cellini's advancement, upon his proficiency in this accomplishment. Benvenuto's ambition, however, was of a far more various and earnest nature than the success of a mere musician could gratify. To please his parent, however, he long continued to devote much time to practising upon his favorite instrument, although the employment was frequently an occasion of ennui and disgust. At length, having been apprenticed to a goldsmith, the skill he displayed in the finer departments of the trade, indicated, in a striking manner, the true bent of his genius. Henceforth, we find Benvenuto constantly employed in various places, and everywhere with distinguished success. It strikes us, at the present day, with no little surprise, to perceive the enthusiasm excited by labors of such a nature as employed the mind of Cellini; but the exquisite grace and rare invention he displayed, were as significant of talent to the admirers of art, in the fifteenth century, as the gifted limner exhibited on his canvas, or the statuary in his marble. His abilities were in constant requisition, and seemed to have excited equal admiration whether bestowed upon a button for the Pope, a chalice for a Cardinal, or a salt-cellar for King Francis.—At one time we find him engraver to the mint at Rome, and at another, exercising all his ingenuity in setting a precious jewel, executing an original medal, or designing the most beautiful figures in alto relievo, upon a golden vase, for some Italian prince. For a considerable period, he was without an equal in his profession. Towards the last of his life, however, his energies seem to have been concentrated upon sculpture, of which the Perseus is the most celebrated specimen. The account he gives of the difficulties surmounted in casting this statue and the unworhy treatment he received from the Grand Duke, in regard to his recompense, is among the most painful examples of the trials of artists. Cellini's life was one of the most singular vicissitude. Frequently changing his abode, working under the patronage of various princes, of a bold and active temper, his memoirs present a picture in which the quiet pursuits of an artist are grotesquely mingled with the experiences of an adventurer. One day, banished from his native city for having been engaged in a bloody quarrel, another, high in the confidence of kings and popes; now pining in the dungeon of St. Angelo, which he once so gallantly defended, and now rich and honored in the service of a magnificent court. If we are to place the slightest faith in his own testimony, Benvenuto proved himself equal to any exigency, and fairly overcame his various enemies by his prompt courage, or quick invention. He is certainly the prince of boasters. The coolness with which he speaks of despatching his foes, is startling to one familiar only with these peaceful times; and the ingenuity with which he baffles those who are not to be reached by the sword, is most remarkable. A striking instance occurred while he was in the employ of the King of France. Madame D'Estampes, who seems to have been extremely disaffected towards Benvenuto, induced the king to inspect some of his most recent works at an hour the most unfavorable for their display. Cellini, anticipating the effect, affixed a torch to the arm of a statue of Jupiter; and while his female enemy and the monarch were regarding his studies, in the dusky light, he suddenly ignited the torch, and wheeled the Jupiter into the centre of the room. The effect was most vivid, as the light was placed at exactly the right angle to show the figure to the best advantage. Francis received a new and powerful impression of the genius of Cellini, and Madame's design was completely counteracted. The versatility of talent in the character of Benvenuto was not more surprising than his boundless self-confidence. How much are we indebted to this quality for the fruits of genius! Gifts of mind, unaccompanied by a vivid sense of their existence, are of little benefit to the world. Consciousness of power, firm and unwavering, is the best guarantee for its appropriate exertion. How much of the cool decision of great men is attributable to confidence in their destiny! When Napoleon was urged to leave a dangerous position, during an engagement when the shot were flying thickly around him, and calmly replied, `the ball is not yet moulded which is destined for me,' who does not recognize one secret cause of his intrepidity? No combination of circumstances seemed adequate to shake Cellini's faith in himself. He spoke as certainly of the issue of an experiment in his art, as if it had been repeatedly proved. Again and again he reinstated himself in the favor from which the machinations of his rivals had removed him, by the clear earnestness of his bearing. Whether discussing the merits of a work of art, defending himself before a tribunal, 10* engaged hand to hand with a foe, or casting a statue which had cost him years of toil, he seemed to act upon the sentiment of the poet— “Courage gone? all's gone— Better never have been born.” It cannot but provoke a smile in contrast with the theories of later moralists, after having followed Benvenuto thruugh an unequalled category of brawls, duels, amours and intrigues, to find him consoling himself in prison by communing with angelic visions, and cheering his heart with the conviction that he is an especial favorite of Heaven. Benvenuto closed his adventurous life where he commenced it; and was buried with many honors, in the church of the Annunziata, at Florence. His native city is adorned with the chief ornament of his genius; and the exquisite specimens of his skill as a jeweller and engraver, are scattered over the cabinets of virtuosi throughout Italy. The opera-house of Florence, called the Pergola, is remarkable for its chaste interior. Romani's poetry has recently given a new interest to this favorite amusement. It seems almost to have revived the dulcet numbers of Metastasio, and wedded to the touching strains of Bellini, leaves no occasion to regret the earlier eras of the musical drama. The want of permanent prose companies in the different cities of Italy, as schools of language, is a great desideratum; and the number of trashy translations from the French, degrade the national taste. Sometimes the excellent company of Turin, including the inimitable Vestri, a Tuscan by birth, visit Florence in the autumn, and furnish a pleasant pastime at the Cocomero, while during Carnival, Stenterello dispenses his jokes and rhymes at the Borg' Ogni Santi. In Florence, alone, is enjoyed the opportunity, at certain seasons, of witnessing Alfieri's tragedies. The stranger, too, cannot but gratefully recur to the comedies of Goldoni. They furnish him with an admirable introduction to the language; and when he is once more at home, and would fain renew the associations of every day life in far distant Italy, he has only to peruse one of these colloquial plays, and be transported, at once, to a locanda or a caffé. Goldoni's history is intimately associated with his comedies. Successively a student of medicine, diplomacy and law, a maker of almanacs, and a comic writer, his personal adventures abound in the humorous. He solaced himself, when unfortunate, by observing the passing scene. When jilted by a woman, or cheated by a knave, he revenged himself by showing up their conduct as a warning, in his next play. He looked upon the panorama of human existence, not as a metaphysician, but as a painter, not to discover the ideal, but to display the actual. Yet he often aimed at bringing popular vices or follies into contempt, and frequently with no little success. At a time when ciscesbeism and gambling prevailed in Venice, he portrayed their consequences so graphically, that, a for time, both practices were brought into disrepute; and when the Spectator began to be read, and it became fashionable for women to affect philosophy, he turned the laugh upon them with his Filosofo Inglese. His comedies have more humor than wit, but their chief attraction is their truth to nature. Although much attached to Venice, his native city, which he declares was never revisited without discovering new beauties, Goldoni seems to have highly enjoyed his long residence at the French court. He boasts of having an excellent appetite after every fresh mortification; and when care or sickness made him wakeful, he was accustomed to translate from the Venetian into the Tuscan dialect, and then into the French, by way of a soporific. Overshadowed as his buoyant spirit was at last, by illness and reverses, his happy temperament made his life pleasant. He had the satisfaction of feeling that, through his efforts, comedy was reformed in Italy, and his country furnished with a stock of standdard plays, of excellent tendency, sixteen of which were composed in one year—no ordinary achievement of industry. The house of the Buonarotti family has recently undergone extensive repairs. But the rooms once occupied by Michael Angelo, remain unchanged, save that around one of them are arranged a series of paintings, illustrative of the artist's life. How Florence teems with the fame of this most gifted of her children! How rife are his sayings on the lips of her citizens! How eloquently do his works speak in the city where his bones repose! As the Cathedral dome first greets the stranger's eye, or fades from his parting gaze, how naturally does it suggest the thoughts of St. Peter's and the artist's well known exclamation! In a twilight walk along the river-side, as we watch the evening star over San Spirito, we remember that a prior of that convent taught him anatomy. If we pass the church del Carmine, we are reminded that he there studied the early efforts of Massacio. In the gallery, we behold the Dancing Faun, whose head he so admirably restored, wonder at the stern face of Brutus, or ponder his own portrait. In the Piazza is his David, in the church of San Lorenzo, his Day and Night, and that perfect embodiment of Horatio's familiar phrase—`a countenance more in sorrow than in anger,'—the statue of the Duke of Urbino. Here he made his figure of snow; there he buried his sleeping Cupid, which was dug up for an antique. Near St. Mark's was the school of sculpture, where he first practiced. In Santa Croce is his tomb. The memory of Michael Angelo constitutes the happiest of the many interesting associations of Florence. Not less as a man than an artist, does his name lend dignity and beauty to the scene. We look upon the master-lines of his unfinished works, and realize the struggles of his soul towards perfection. Truly has one of his biographers remarked, `his genius was vast and wild, by turns extravagant and capricious, rarely to be implicitly followed, always to be studied with advantage.' But we think not merely here of the sculptor, painter, architect, philosopher and poet; we dwell upon, and feel the whole character of him who so nobly proved his eminent claim to these various titles. As we tread the chambers where he passed so many nights of study, so many days of toil, as we behold the oratory where he prayed, or stand above his ashes, we think of his noble independence which princes and prelates, in a venal age, could not subdue, of his deep sympathy with the grand and beautiful in human nature, and of his true affection which dictated the sentiment— “Better plea Love cannot find than that in loving thee, Glory to that eternal Peace is paid Who such divinity to thee imparts, As hallows and makes pure all gentle hearts.” Art seemed not an exclusive end to Michael Angelo. For fame, he cherished no morbid appetite. He was conscious of loftier aims. His letters and sonnets breathe the noblest aspirations, and the most perfect love of truth. When refused admittance to the Pope's presence, he quitted Rome in disgust; yet watched as tenderly by the sick-bed of a faithful servant, as at that of a son or a brother. As the architect of St. Peter's, he declined all emolument; and kissed the cold hand of Vittoria Colonna with tearful reverence. After eighty-eight years spent in giving a mighty impulse to the arts, in cultivating sculpture, painting, poetry and architecture, in observing `the harmless comedy of life,' in proving the supremacy of genius over wealth, of moral power over rank, of character over the world, Michael Angelo died, saying, `My soul I resign to God, my body to the earth, and my possessions to my nearest kin.' He left a bequest of which he spoke not, for it was already decreed that his fame and example should shed a perennial honor upon Florence, and for ever bless the world. THE THESPIAN SYREN. But ever and anon of grief subdued There comes a token like a scorpion's sting, Scarce seen, but with fresh bitterness imbued. Byron. I. It was towards the close of a cool but delightful autumn evening, in Milan, the best part of which I had vainly spent in searching for a friend. All at once it occurred to me that he might beat the opera;—yet, thought I, F— is very fastidious, and there is no particular attraction to-night. Thus weighing the matter on my mind, I came within sight of the Scala, and I was soon at the door of Count G—'s box, where F— was generally to be found. The orchestra was performing an interlude, and the foot-lights beaming upon the beautiful classical groups depicted on the drop. My friend was not visible, and I should instantly have retreated, had not a side glance revealed to me the figure of a young man, seated in the shadow of the box curtains. Count G— was partial to Americans, and I scrutinized the stranger, thinking it not impossible he was a countryman, but soon recognized the countenance of a Scotch student, with whom I had exchanged a few words at our table-d'hote in the morning. It was several minutes before I satisfied myself of his identity, so different was his aspect and demeanor. He sat opposite me, at the table, and was engaged in a most lively conversation with a flaxen-haired daughter of Vienna, who appeared delighted with the opportunity of reciting the story of her travels to a new acquaintance, which she persisted in doing, notwithstanding the obvious displeasure of her father, a military character, who morosely devoured his dinner beside her. Her auditor repaid the lady's condescension with an account of the customs and traditions of the Highlanders, in doing which the keen air of his native hills seemed to inspire him; for from a constrained and quiet, he gradually glided into a free and earnest manner, and evolved enthusiasm enough to draw sympathizing looks even from a coterie of native Italians, his opposite neighbors. Frank Graham was now in a totally different mood. He sat, braced in his seat, as if under the influence of some nervous affection; his lips when released from the restraint imposed upon them, quivered incessantly, and—it might have been fancy—but I thought I saw, in the dusky light, several hasty tears fall upon the crimson drapery. There is something in the deep emotion of a man of intellectual vigor—and such, Graham's table-talk had proved him—which interests us deeply. The very attempt to check the tide of feeling, the struggle between the reason and the heart, the affective and reflective powers, as a phrenologist would say, awakens our sympathy. I forgot the object of my visit to the Scala, and silently resolved to lead off my fellow-sojourner from the memory of his disquietude, or draw from him its cause, and, if possible, act the comforter. With this view, I approached him carelessly, as if I had not noticed his emotion, and proffered him the greetings of the evening. He looked at me vacantly, a moment, but soon rejoined with cordiality. Then rising and drawing his cloak around him, he seized my hand and exclaimed—`Let us leave this place, my friend.' There was confidence implied in his tremulous tones, yet I was half in doubt as to the propriety of alluding to his obvious depression. It was a fine moonlight night, and we walked side by side for several minutes, in silence. `How long since you left home, Mr. Graham?' I inquired by, way of beginning a colloquy. `Five minutes ago, or thereabouts,' he replied huskily. I halted in surprise, and gazed upon him in wonder. He stopped also, and observing my astonishment continued in a clearer voice, `Do not be alarmed my friend; I am perfectly sane; literally speaking, I left Scotland five years since, but just now your voice aroused me to a consciousness of where and what I am. I have been carried back not only to my country, but to my youth, to its richest hour, to its most vivid epoch; you, by a word, dissolved the spell: —there is the famous cathedral, this is Milan, and I am nothing now but Frank Graham; but one memento of my recent fairy land remains'—and he pointed to the moon. `Oh what mistaken kindness we sometimes practice!' 11 I replied; you seemed brooding over some sorrowful subject. I thought to divert your attention. Forgive my intrusion, for many, many injuries are fanciful and unworthy the name, compared with that which drags a happy idealist from his ærie in the heavens, down to life's common and desert shore.' `Say you so, my friend?' returned Graham, `then you will not laugh at an incident in the life of an enthusiast. Come, come,' and he drew my arm within his, and quickened his pace. The window of my room at the Albergo, reached to the floor, and overlooked a small garden; as we entered, I placed the lamps in a distant corner, threw open the curtains and admitted the full light of the moon. `Now, Heaven grant,' said I, as Frank Graham esconced himself in a corner of the sofa, and filled his glass from a flask of red wine—`Heaven grant that your's is a tale of love and chivalry, for such a scene ill befits an unromantic legend.'—`It is, indeed, a glorious night; but who ever heard, in these days, of a poor Scotch student essaying at tournament or holy war, except in the field of fiction, as here,'—and he lifted `Ivanhoe' from the table—`yet remember that this lovely orb smiles equally upon the love-vigils of the Highland chief, as upon those of the knights of old, and her beams must seem as romantic to you, while I improvise a chapter of my autobiography, as they did to Rebecca the Jewess, daughter of Isaac of York, when the wounded knight related, at the same witching season, his adventures in Palestine.' II. The vivid impression which our `first play' leaves upon the mind might teach us something, if we were introspective moralists, as to that greatly mooted point—the true influence of the drama. Perchance from the deep and splendid visions thus awakened to the fancy, the clear and romantic aspect which humanity thus portrayed assumes, we might discover no questionable affinity between our own unsophisticated natures and the dramatic art, we might appreciate the importance of such an institution as the theatre to civilized man, to the dawning mind, to the human being as such; we might with perfect consistency, learn to rank the legitimate drama in the poetry of life. But however this may be, there are many incidental experiences where an universal end is pursued. About every general object, personal associations abundantly cling. There is deep truth in the great German writer's remark—`every individual spirit wakes in the great stream of multitude.' Lamb's first visit to the theatre was powerfully associated with a plate prefixed to Rowe's Shakspeare. This event with me, is linked with a deeper reminiscence, for it occurred at an age of deeper susceptibility. `I was educated at the University of St. Andrews, and from a three years' residence there, divided between study, solitary walks along the sea-shore, and attendance upon prudential lectures daily delivered by the maiden aunt with whom I resided, I was, all at once, removed to the metropolis and entered as a law student. At Edinburgh, I boarded with a distant relation who was a great musical amateur. In his house there also resided a very eccentric man, a dramatist by profession. He had an interest in some score of plays, more or less popular, having either composed or adapted them to the stage. The manager of one of the principal theatres was his intimate friend, and had exerted himself to bring out Mr. Connington's dramas so successfully, that they were then yielding him a very handsome income. At every meal, dramatic literature was discussed, and the merits of various actors canvassed. Not infrequently my kinsman, who was quite an adept in such matters, gave imitations of the best tragedians, by way of an evening's pastime. As you may suppose, I soon became much interested in the subject of these conversations. To me a new field of thought was opened. And yet evening after evening, I declined invitations to attend the theatre. This was thought quite surprising, particularly as I manifested so much interest in every thing that was going on there, and after a while took no inconsiderable part in the dramatic conversations. The truth was, my imagination was wrought up to the highest pitch. My `first play' assumed an importance in my mind, which it is difficult to describe. I came to regard it as one of the great epochs of existence. I anticipated its effects as nervous people sometimes fancy the operation of some powerful nostrum, or as I can imagine Sir Humphrey Davy looked forward to the effect of a new gas. In consequence of this feeling, I made great preparations for the event. I read Shakspeare with greater attention than ever before, informed myself of the history of the drama, read innumerable criticisms, biographies and lectures illustrative of the whole subject, and finally determined to be governed by circumstances as to the occasion I should choose to make my debut as a playgoer. `I entered our little parlor one cold, drizzly evening, five years ago this very night, my head throbbing with six long hours' delving into the mysteries of the law. In no very good humor, I seated myself before the grate to await the dinner hour. I was gazing rather moodily at the fire, when something intercepted its rays; I looked up, Mr. Connington was at my elbow holding a printed bill before me. I could distinguish but one word, `Virginius.' `Mr. Graham,' said my friend, `you must go to-night.'—`I will,' said I, and we sat down to dinner. `During the meal I was unusually silent. I was quite oppressed with the thought that I was so near an end so long anticipated. I fancied I had been too precipitate. I felt like one standing at the entrance of a splendid Gothic cathedral; it seemed to me that a single step would bring me into an overpowering scene. III. `How little, my friend, can a man of acute, lively sensibilities calculate upon the experience that awaits him! A skilful devotee of science can predict, with a good degree of certainty, the approach of celestial phenomena, the existence of unseen fountains, and even the direction of the unborn breeze; but who has the foresight to prophecy the destiny of feeling—to indicate the next new influence which shall arouse it, to trace its untravelled course, or point confidently to its issue? A man conscious of a fathomless tide of feeling within him, who throws himself into a world of moral excitements, knows but 11* this, that he is doomed to feel deeply, variously, often to suffer agony—often to enjoy delight. But the very means he thought would prove most magnetic, may absolutely fail to attract, and some unexpected agency, of which he dreamed not, may approach the unguarded portal of his soul, and take it by surprise. Such was my experience when I trusted myself to dramatic influences. I had thought to be subject to them as a philosopher; but while seeking this end I was taught most emphatically to realize my own humanity. `The leading actress on the Edinburgh boards at the period to which I refer, was Helen Trevor. This was not, indeed, the name by which she was known to the public; for being the daughter of a distinguished performer, it was deemed expedient for her to appear under her mother's family name, which was one of the highest in the annals of the British stage. I first saw her in Virginia, and never, no, never can I forget that memorable evening. In the first act, when Virginius says to Servia, `Go fetch her to me,' I observed all around me silent and intent from expectation. It was not till the deafening greetings had subsided, that I raised my eyes, and then my cherished ideal of female beauty was realized. The chaste dress of white muslin—the thick dark ringlets about the neck—the simple girdle—the little satin band around the beautiful brow—the quiet, gentle and touching simplicity of the air and accents—all, all are before me. How deeply I sympathised in the indignation of Virginius—how I wept when he recited his daughter's praises! Unfortunately, the part of Icilius was played by a novice. Had it been otherwise, perhaps my emotions, overpowering as they were, might have been subdued; but while all the other characters satisfied me, his, Virginia's lover's, the very part with which I felt myself identified, was shamefully weak. I was absolutely maddened. The theatre vanished from my mind. I thought of nothing, cared for nothing but that fair young creature, and the idea possessed me, with a frightful tenacity, that I should one day be the true Icilius. As the play proceeded I became more and more lost in this idea. It was only when the wretched personator of the Roman lover came on, that the illusion vanished. And then a bitter and impatient hatred possessed me. I longed to clutch the young man, and hurl him away. And when the Roman father, in solemn and touching tones, said— You are my witnesses That this young creature I present to you I do pronounce my profitably cherished, And most deservedly beloved child— My daughter truly filial, both in word And act, yet even more in act than word— I tremblingly ejaculated, `We are, we are.' A lady in the box thought I was faint and proffered her salts. I took the vial mechanically, but was not recalled; for a moment after, when the words reached my enamoured ear— You will be all Her father has been—added unto all A lover would be? the query seemed addressed to me; unable longer to contain what rushed to my lips, I rose, sprang upon the seat, and shouted, `I will, I will'—but the words were broken —I felt a hand close tightly over my mouth, and myself lifted into the lobby, whence I was hurried, without a word, into a hackney coach, by the dim lights of which I discovered Mr. Connington, who had firmly grasped one arm, while a gentleman, whom I recognised as an occupant of the box, held the other. They evidently thought me mad. `This adventure was a salutary and timely lesson. Never again did I betray any emotion. But I felt the more. The drama which I had fancied would produce such mighty effects on my mind, was nothing except as it was associated with her. O my friend, you can have no idea of what mingled ecstacy and bitterness is involved in the love of an object of public admiration! Sometimes I would have given worlds if Helen had been a tradesman's daughter, living in honorable obscurity, and then when evening came, I saw her personating the grandest female characters of history, arrayed in an ideal costume, uttering the noblest sentiments, and appearing as the faithful, the self-denying, the beautiful representative of her sex; and then, in those moments, I wished her ever to be the same. But poor Shakspeare! where was my reverence for him? Strange fantasy, the world would have thought, had I written a new commentary on his tragedies, to declare that the most eloquent line in Romeo and Juliet was Lady Capulet's, `Nurse, where's my daughter? call her forth to me'—and in Othello's speech, the most awakening phrase the last, `Here comes my lady, let her witness it.' Yet such they were to me, for they called first upon the stage Juliet and Desdemona. `Many weeks flew by, and my time was ostensibly divided between Blackstone and the drama. My kinsman frequently applauded this rare union of rational and imaginative studies. `Few young men, cousin Frank,' he would say, `choose so wisely. I perceive you did not study the philosophy of the human mind, at St. Andrews, in vain. Here you devote the day to legal investigations, which, questionless, have a tendency to invigorate the understanding, to create just habits of thinking, and train the judgment; then your evenings are given to the greatest imaginative amusement of this utilitarian age. You cultivate a taste for the drama. Well, well, cousin, we'll make a fine fellow of you yet.' In these remarks Mr. Connington would coincide, neutralizing his praises with the observation that Mr. Graham's dramatic criticisms were, somehow or other, more vague and less to the purpose, than before he attended the theatre.' Neither of these sage observers of human nature, however, had the least idea of the true state of the case. And, indeed, it was not till late that I myself discovered with wonder which partook strangely of regret and gladness, that it was not Cordelia or Virginia that I loved, but Helen Trevor. IV. `Hitherto my love had been ideal. Personal intercourse had not revealed to me the imperfections of the fair Thespian.—Report spoke highly of her character, and the earnest approbation of the public sufficiently indicated her professional genius. Strange as the remark would seem to a mere worldly reasoner, you my friend, will understand me, when I assert that few attachments excelled mine in real and beautiful sentiment. It was much like the love which we know ardent men have cherished for a portrait, a statue, or the being of their dreams.—Whatever the object of my affections, in reality, was—however tainted with the alleged evil influences of her pursuit, however intellectually endowed or morally gifted—remember that as presented to me, she was always the living portrait of departed worth, the renovated image of some hallowed being, the human embodiment of a poet's dream. Naturally favored with a classical species of womanly beauty, displaying manners in which feminine grace and modesty struggled with a vivid conception of the part she was representing—you cannot wonder that a hallow of romance was thrown around the person of my idol. I never saw her but as the personator of virtue. No other parts were adapted to her talents. And thus, to my ardent fancy, she became the personification of all that was good, and beautiful, and true. `It was not in human nature to be long content with such a semi-interchange of sympathy. Alas! the thought struck me, all at once, that there had been no interchange, that my heart had been given to one who knew me not— that I was no more to the Thespian than the multitude who nightly witnessed her performance. I felt foolishly conscious of my wandering moods. I resolved, after long and troubled musing, to come face to face with the admired actress. And yet I feared to adventure. The charm might be dissolved, or it might be confirmed. What then? I should, at least, know my fate. Stripped of the adventitious aid of her profession, she might prove uninteresting. And then—I laughed wildly at the thought—I should be free! Yet, in a moment I discarded the idea. If I have been in bondage this month past, thought I, then let me be a slave forever. It seemed to me easier to die a victim to imaginary wo, than to return again to barren studies or common cares. My resolution taken, I grew impatient, yet never suffered myself to think of what I was about to do, without realizing that awe with which the German dramatist says all mortals must `grasp the urn of destiny.' `Capital, capital!' exclaimed Mr. Connington, one morning, at the breakfast-table, as he laid down the Post and resumed his muffin. `What is it?' inquired my cousin, taking up the paper. `Why, an excellent criticism on the Portia we saw Monday night.' `Ah! signed F. G., too—who can that be?' `Who should it be but Frank Graham?' asked the dramatist, his eye brightening at the discovery. I could not deny the authorship. Mr. Connington hastily swallowed his last cup of tea, and as he left the room, with a significant nod, remarked— `Well done, master Frank; she shall know it, too; she shall, I declare.' I was after him in an instant. `My dear Mr. Connington,' said I, `pray be careful. If you choose to force this hasty notice upon the attention of Miss —, do it in a way which shall impress her favorably as to the author. See, see, my friend, that I am not merged in her mind with the herd of coxcomb admirers whom I am sure she despises.' The energy with which I spoke astonished him, but recovering quickly from his surprise, he replied, `Why, look you, my young man; the literary editor of this paper is the best friend her family ever had; I mean he shall tell her. And should you like to know her, Frank? I'll ask him to introduce you. What say?' I could scarcely speak from agitation. So near the object of my wishes? It seemed impossible. Clinging to Mr. Connington's arm, I accompanied him down to the last step, succeeding finally in hurriedly signifying my assent. I was lost in joyful surprise, from which I was aroused by my cousin's voice reprimanding the porter for leaving the street door open, and hastened in, to prepare for the expected interview. `That long forenoon passed heavily enough. Not an iota of legal knowledge did it bring me. The dinner hour came. I longed to know if Mr. Connington had seen the editor; but the conversation, for the first time since my arrival in Edinburgh turned upon foreign politics, and argument ensued. I thought it inexpressibly tedious. My abstraction was noticed, which I did not regret, since it relieved my suspense. `Frank,' said the dramatist, `your wits seem a wool-gathering. Rally, man!—you 're a critic, you know. I'm sorry my editorial friend has gone to Glasgow for a fortnight. I saw him this morning, just as he was starting. Give my regards to Mr. Graham,' said he; `I hope to form his acquaintance on my return—and then, as you say he's really a fine fellow—I'll introduce him to Miss —; a thing I would not do for many young men. The lady has no time to waste, and hates promiscuous acquaintances.' I was terribly disappointed. A fortnight's delay seemed an age. A proposal of my cousin suggested consolation.—`Frank,' said he, `I want you to know my friend Bouvier the composer; he has a sanctum near the painting-room of the theatre—we'll go up and see him to-night, between the acts.' `The platforms extending over the wings, above the stage are called the flies. They command a view of the actors and the orchestra. It was necessary to cross these, on our way to the composer's studio. I looked down a moment as we passed, and was delighted to find that while the stage was completely under my cognizance, I myself was invisible to the performers, unless indeed they should take great pains to spy me out. I determined to become intimate with the musical occupant of this curious region, that I might at will come hither, and, unseen, behold the Thespian. Mr. Bouvier, upon my kinsman's favorable representation of my talents, begged me to write the words adapted to some opera music he was preparing. And thus was I unexpectedly furnished with a reasonable excuse for frequenting the vicinity of the hallowed scene of my favorite labors. `The next day, at about noon—the hour I had ascertained she would be at rehearsal, I closed a huge volume of commentaries, snatched up my hat, and, with a beating heart, hastened to the theatre. I entered the private door, passed through the corridors, by the range of dressing-rooms, and, to my joy, encountered no one until I arrived at the top of the stairs, where stood a knot of carpenters, 12 planning some stage device. They stared a little at my appearance. `Where is Mr. Bouvier's room?' I inquired. `This way, sir,' said one of the men, conducting me across the apartment to a little door. The moment he retired, I gently closed it behind me, and found myself alone upon the flies. It was sometime before, in the kind of twilight which prevailed, I could distinctly behold the scene upon the stage. Near the foot-lights stood a small table, upon which three or four candles were burning amid a mass of papers, two or three books, and a standish. Here sat a portly man who, I afterwards learned, was the prompter; beside him was a lad technically denominated the call-boy; and standing about in groups, pacing in couples to and fro, or ranged in order and reading their several parts, were the performers. It was only now and then that a phrase or two stole up to my ear from the voices below, but the tones familiar to my dreams arose not.—Suddenly the readers paused and looked round, as if a new personage should appear. The prompter whispered to the urchin at his side, and the boy ran towards the green-room, shouting the name that was to me so sacred. Presently the Thespian entered. I saw her for the first time in the ordinary habit of her sex. Her dress was simple, but becoming in the extreme. Her manner of greeting the performers, and their obvious deference towards her, confirmed me in the idea I had formed of her lady-like demeanor in private life. Hearing some one approach, I glided into Mr. Bouvier's room. But to this post of observation I daily repaired. Thence I watched every movement and caught every tone of the Thespian O how fleetly sped the hours as I leaned in watchful reverie over the old oaken beam, and gazed down upon the rehearsals! The superiority of my charmer among her mates, her self-possessed dignity under the trying circumstances of her lot—I saw and marked from my ærie, and fondly remembered ever. Sometimes I was tempted to spring down into the midst of the group who were blessed with her presence. At such moments I turned aside and paced the platform, then looked down again, and wrestled with my impatience till she departed, and then hurried into the street to catch a glimpse of her beautiful figure, as it glided through the neighboring thoroughfares to her home. `The fortnight elapsed; the editor returned. It was a fine, clear morning—I remember it as if it were to-day. I was earlier than usual at my post, and judged, from the aspect of things below, that a quarter of an hour would elapse before the performers would assemble. Helen was there. I was at the office of the Post in a trice. `Is Mr. — in?' I breathlessly asked. `He is,' was the reply, and I was shown into the inner room. `Good morning, sir,' I began. “I am Mr. Graham, the gentleman whom you kindly promised to introduce to Miss —. She is at the theatre now, sir; the rehearsal has not commenced. Can you conveniently accompany me at once?' `Certainly, sir, with the greatest pleasure. I have to see the lady myself. I brought a letter from her brother in Glasgow.' `How we got to the theatre, I cannot tell. One over-powering idea possessed me. I believed this introduction was the turning point in my destiny. I answered only in monosyllables to the editor's warm eulogiums of the Thespian, and ran along almost dragging him, despite his half articulated protestations against the pedestrianism of country-bred Scotchmen. Emerging from the glare of mid-day into the shadowy gloom of the theatre, we stopped to take breath and accustom our dimmed vision to the change. My companion taking my hand, drew me between two scenes in about the centre line of the stage, and there we began to observe. `Is she here?' I asked faintly. Just then Helen appeared, slowly walking up the stage, intent upon a manuscript. She was dressed in a simple gown of black silk, and over her neck was carelessly flung a shawl of richly wrought lace of the same color. As she walked, the light from a very high upper window fell directly upon her features; and ever and anon, she lifted her full expressive eye from the paper, and repeated to herself, as if to make trial of her memory. When she came parallel with us, my companion whispered her name. She turned towards us; he stepped forward, and was instantly recognized and kindly greeted. A few expressions passed between them among which such words as—`news,' `cold,' `Glasgow,' and others of an import so common-place that they seemed to mock the solemn interest of my feelings, when my companion beckoned me forward. I approached with my hat in my hand and my heart in my throat. `Miss —, this is the gentleman of whom I spoke to you,—Mr. Francis Graham, of —.' `I am happy to see you, Mr. Graham,' returned the Thespian, with a smile that thrilled me, and an accent that seemed heavenly. I bowed repeatedly. I looked my veneration and tenderness. I could not speak. V. `I had passed the Rubicon, and thenceforth obeyed the impulse of my feelings fearlessly and freely. Every night found me behind the wings. The best oranges that searching could procure in Edinburgh, the fairest roses of the public gardens, did I lay, as votive offerings, on the shrine of my idolatry. Five memorable times I attended the Thespian to her home. On three memorable evenings I sat beside her, in the midst of her family. I was abundantly content. If any thing had been necessary to deepen my interest, it was afforded by the acquaintance I now formed with her character. She followed her profession uncomplainingly, for the sake of those dependent for support upon her toils. During a morning walk to Salisbury crags, I resolved on the succeeding night to offer my hand to the Thespian. I determined to marry her openly; to lead her before the public on her farewell benefit. As I strolled back to the city, I was composing the poetical address which I determined she should speak on this occasion, when the door of my law office, which I had mechanically reached, interrupted my muse. I gravely entered, took down the proper volume in course, opened it at the right place, and seating myself before the extended page, fixed my eyes intently 12* upon it, and was soon lost in—dreaming of Helen Trevor. `It was a lovely afternoon, the one preceding the evening of my intended declaration. I was in my chamber, cutting the dead leaves from some wild flowers, just brought me from the country. Helen was to play Ophelia that night, and these were destined for her `fennells, columbines, and rue, her violets and daises.' There was a noise in the passage. A sudden foreboding oppressed me. The door slowly opened, and in walked my old aunt, the Professor of Moral Philosophy in the University at St. Andrews, my cousin and Mr. Connington. There was an awful gravity in their countenances. The flowers dropped from my hands; I was aghast with astonishment and anxiety. The intruders silently seated themselves. `Nephew,' said my aunt, in the old lecture tone, but with unwonted severity of manner, `I need not ask for whom those foolish weeds are designed; I know all, sir. The disrespect you have shown for the honor of your family, my honored kinsman has informed me of. I warned him never to reprimand you, but always to notify me of your misdemeanors. This he has done, in season, happily, to prevent farther mischief. Your learned friend, here,—and she pointed to the professor—starts to-morrow for France. We have decided that he shall be the companion of your travels. Prepare to accompany him, sir.' `Suffice it to add, that I was forced from Edinburgh without being permitted to see the Thespian. Nearly five years have I been on the continent. Knowledge I have devotedly pursued, but I was born to live and joy in feeling. I have never entered a theatre since my departure from home, till to night, the anniversary of my `first play.' I ventured, and you saw how I was over-come, ay, and lured into repeating, for the first time during my exile, the tale you have so patiently heard.' `Receive my earnest thanks, and all my sympathy,' I replied; `but what became of the Thespian?'—`She went to America, and report says she is there married.' `One query more ere you go'—for he had risen to depart—`deep as is your grief, you evidently have a theory that supports you. I have seen you cheerful—what is it? He smiled, and taking a miniature edition of Childe Harold from his pocket, said, `It is written here;' then grasping my hand, he repeated with great force and pathos, the following lines: Existence may be borne, and the deep root Of life and sufferance make its firm abode In bare and desolated bosoms: mute The camel labors with the heaviest load, And the wolf dies in silence: not bestowed In vain should such examples be; if they, Things of ignoble or of savage mood, Endure and shrink not, we of nobler clay May temper it to bear,—it is but for a day. MODENA. “There are those who lord it o'er their fellow-men With most prevailing tinsel.”— Keats. Of all the strong holds of despotism at present existing in Italy, Modena excites in the mind of a republican the greatest impatience. The narrow limits of the state are in ludicrous contrast with the tyrannical propensities of the government. One cannot approach the neat little capital and gaze through the vine-ranges of the contiguous plains, to the distant and snow-clad Appenines, without dwelling regretfully upon the political condition of a people, upon whose domain nature has lavished her resources with a richness that would seem to ensure their prosperity and happiness. The conduct of the Modenese during the revolutionary excitement, which agitated this part of Italy several years since, and which is now alluded to with a significant shrug, as l'affare di trent`uno, and the sufferings consequent upon its failure, are such also as to elicit the hearty sympathy of every true friend of liberal principles. The Grand Duke, when compelled to fly under the escort of the single battalion of his troops, who mained faithful to him, assured one of his old domestics, who expressed much commiseration on the occasion, that in three days he would return and quell the little disturbance. For more than a month, however, the capital remained in the possession of the people, who displayed during this exciting epoch, a singular respect for individual rights, and maintained a degree of order and good faith, worthy of a more fortunate issue. Even the priests assumed the tri-coloured cockade; and among the armed citizens were many of the sturdy peasants from the neighboring hills. And when the fugitive prince returned from Vienna, at the head of fifteen thousand Austrian troops, a large body of the national guard displayed the most commendable bravery in defending those of the revolutionists who were compelled to flee, conducting them in safety, and not without several severe skirmishes, to Ancona, whence they embarked for different ports in the Mediterranean and Adriatic. A series of executions, imprisonments and confiscations followed, and the traveller continually meets with the unhappy effects of this impotent attempt to establish liberty, in the number of impoverished individuals, the restricted privileges of all classes, and the increased rigor of the police. The manner in which the plot was discovered was rather curious. One of the conspirators was arrested on suspicion of theft, and thinking all was known, spoke so freely of the plan and persons pledged to its support, that every important detail was soon revealed. After this abortive revolution, no political event has agitated the north of Italy, until the unexpected occupation of Ancona by the French. An occurrence which recently took place there was the occasion of much merriment. It appears that among the French officers, was one who prided himself greatly upon his skill with the broad-sword. In order to give scope to this talent, he had deliberately bullied nearly all his colleagues, besides a large number of Italian gentlemen into quarrels, and having invariably come off triumphant, his arrogance was proportionably increased. At length weary of the peaceable life he led and impatient for a new victim, he entered the principal caffé in Ancona, one evening when it was fully occupied, and for want of a better subject, fixed his regard upon an athletic and handsome priest who was quietly reading at a table. Monsieur took a seat by his side. The priest soon after called for a cup of coffee, which the officer immediately took possession of. The latter not doubting it was done through inadvertance, renewed the order; the Frenchman eagerly grasped the second cup also. Without losing his patience in the least, the priest for the third time repeated his demand, and again his tormentor unceremoniously appropriated the beverage to himself. By this time, the singular behavior of the duellist, had attracted the attention of every one present; and the priest in an elevated but calm tone, turning to his tormentor, exclaimed, “How unworthy a man of true courage, to insult one whose profession forbids resentment!” The officer started to his feet in a rage— “Priest, or no priest,” said he, “you have called me a coward and I demand satisfaction.” The priest had now also risen and folding his robes about him, with dignified coolness he addressed his adversary. “Sir, you shall be satisfied. I believe among those of your profession, it is customary for the challenged party, to choose the place, time, and weapon. Accordingly, sir, let the place be here, the time now, and the weapon this,” and with a single blow he hurled him upon the floor in the centre of the room. The crest-fallen bully was glad to make his escape, amid the jeers of the company. A few plain tomb-stones, in an enclosure just before reaching one of the gates, indicate the Hebrew burying ground. The sight of these isolated graves but too truly illustrates the relentless persecution which still follows the Jews in Italy—a spirit which was manifested with no little severity by the reinstated Duke of Modena. It having been ascertained that four of the fraternity had taken an humble part in the popular movement, a fine of six hundred thousand francs was levied on the whole sect, and their number being very small in the Modenese territory, the payment of the tribute reduced a large portion of the Israelites to absolute beggary. A still more affecting instance of the penalties inflicted upon the liberals of Modena, came under my observation. In the carriage which conveyed me from the little duchy, was a lady of middle age, the expression of whose countenance was so indicative of recent affliction, as to awaken immediate sympathy. I remarked, too, that peculiar manner which evinces superiority to suffering, or rather a determination to meet opposing circumstances with decision of character and moral courage. No one who has ever had occasion to notice the uprising of a woman's spirit, after the first burst of passionate sorrow over the mysterious destiny, so truly described by one of the sweetest of female poets— `to make idols and to find them clay,' can ever mistake the manner to which I allude. It is evident in the calm attention with which the routine of life's duties are fulfilled, as if they no longer interested the feelings, but were simply dictated by necessity. It is seen in the long reveries which occupy the intervals of active engagements; and it is to be read at a glance in the tranquil tone, the changeless expression, and the mild composure which touch with something of sanctity, the person of one whose existence is bereft of its chief attraction. I was soon persuaded that such was the case, with the lady who sat beside me in the Modenese voiture. She answered my questions with that ready affability which belongs to the better class of Italians, and with the quick intelligence of a cultivated mind. For some time our conversation was of a general nature, until I learned that the object of her journey was to remove a son from college, who, for some years, had been pursuing his studies in Tuscany This led us to speak of education—of its momentuous importance, and of its neglect in Italy. I remarked that it seemed to me that the prevailing corruption of manners was attributable chiefly to the want of good domestic culture; that the homes of the land were not the sanctuaries for the mind and affections they should be, because expediency alone was the basis of most of the connections. “Signor,” she replied, “you speak truly, and when, alas, there are those who have the independence and the feeling to disregard the dominant system, and create one of the sacred homes which you say grace your native land, death soon severs the ties which were too blessed to continue.” Tears filled her eyes, and it was long before she recovered her equanimity sufficiently again to engage in conversation. I subsequently learned that this lady was the widow of a distinguished scientific professor of Modena, who had ardently sympathised in the vain attempt of his countrymen to enfranchise themselves from the trammels of despotism. In consequence of his prominence as a man of letters, it became necessary for him on the unsuccessful termination of the struggle, to leave the state. He accordingly fled to Corsica, where he soon received from the Grand Duke of Tuscany, an invitation to visit Florence, and the offer of a valuable professorship. When this became known to the Modenese government, he was informed that if he did not return to his native state, his property would be confiscated; while it was well known that on his re-appearance within the precincts of the duchy, his head would pay the forfeit of his attachment to freedom. He was, therefore, soon joined by his family, and long continued to perform his duties with distinguished success at Florence. By a species of compromise, his wife enjoys a limited portion of her just income, by residing most of the year upon her estates, the remainder going to increase the ducal treasury. The husband had died a short time previous, and his widow was then returning from one of her annual sojourns 13 amid the scenes of her former happiness, a requisition to which parental love led her to submit, in order to preserve the already invaded rights of her fatherless children. The general policy of the Duke of Modena accords with this spirit of petty tyranny. He is now carrying into execution many costly projects, some of which, indeed, tend to embellish the city; but the means to defray them are provided by taxes as contrary to the spirit of social advancement, as they are onerous and unwise. It is sufficient to mention the tribute exacted from all foreign artists, who execute works at the quarries of Carrara, a measure utterly unworthy an enlightened European ruler in the nineteenth century. The countenance of this prince struck me as altogether accordant with his character; and the manifest servility of the vocalists at the court opera, was something new and striking even in Italy. It was not a little annoying, too, to hear in that splendid spartito of the Puritani— Suoni la tromba, e intrepido Io pugnerai da forte; Bello è affrontar la morte Gridando libertà— which thrills like the spirit of freedom, through the very heart, the word loyalty substituted for liberty. The ducal palace of Modena is truly magnificent. Unfortunately the grand saloon has proved unfit for the festive scenes it was designed to witness, from the powerful echo produced by its lofty and vaulted ceiling. Music, and even the voice when slightly elevated, awakens such a response as to create anything but an harmonious impression. The walls of the splendid range of apartments, of which this elegant hall constitutes the centre, are adorned with beautiful frescos, and lined with the richest paintings. Among the latter, is a fine crucifixion by Guido, and the death of Abel by one of his most promising pupils. I examined this picture with interest when informed that the author died very young. The meek beauty of Abel's face, bowed down beneath the iron hold of the first murderer, whose rude grasp is fiercely fixed upon his golden hair, while the hand of the victim is laid deprecatingly upon his brother's breast, abounds in that expressive contrast which is so prolific a source of true effect in art, and literature and life. The pleasing impression derived from dwelling upon the numerous interesting paintings here collected, is somewhat rudely dispelled when one emerges from the palace into the square, and sees the soldiers parading before the gate, and artillery planted in the piazza, and turns his thoughts from the ennobling emblems of genius, to the well appointed machinery of despostism. In a chamber of the ancient tower, is preserved the old wooden bucket which is said to have been the occasion of a war between Bolgna and Modena. It is suspended by its original chain from the centre of the wall, and is regarded as a curious and valuable relic, having been immortalized by Tassoni in his celebrated poem La Secchia Rapita. My memory, however, was busy with another trophy memorialized in modern poetry. I remember hearing a gentleman who had won some enviable laurels in the field of letters, declare that the most gratifying tribute he ever received, was the unaffected admiration with which a country lass regarded him in a stage-coach, after discovering that he was the author of a few verses which had found their way into the reader used in the public school she attended. This class book was the first work which had unveiled to the ardent mind of the maiden, the sweet mysteries of poetry, and this particular piece had early fascinated her imagination, and been transferred to her memory. In expressing her feelings to the poet, she assured him that it had never occurred to her that the author of these familiar lines was alive, far less that he was so like other men, and, least of all, that she should ever behold and talk with him. It seemed to her a very strange, as it certainly was a delightful coincidence. And such is the universal force of early associations, that we all more or less share the feelings of this unsophisticated girl; and in a country where education is pursued on a system which is prevalent with us, many minds derive impressions from school-book literature, which even the more ripened taste and altered views of later life, cannot efface Often have I thus read with delight one of the prettiest sketches in Roger's Italy— “If ever you should come to Modena, Stop at the palace near the Reggio gate, Dwelt in of old by one of the Orsini; The noble garden terrace above terræce, And rich in fountains, statues, cypresses, Will long detain you, but before you go, Enter the house—forget it not I pray,— And look a while upon a picture there. 'Tis of a lady in her earliest youth,” &amp;c. Little did I think in the careless season of boyhood, that the opportunity would ever be afforded me of following the poet's advice. Yet here I found myself in Modena, and it seemed to me like an outrage upon better feeling, as well as good taste, not to adopt the pleasant counsel that rang in my ears, as if the kind-hearted banker poet inclined his white locks and whispered it himself. I lost no time, therefore, in inquiring for this interesting picture, but in vain. By one of the thousand vicissitudes which are ever changing the relics of Italy to the eye of the traveller, Ginevra's portrait had been removed from its original position. The oldest cicerone in the place assured me that he had ineffectually endeavored to trace it. It was evidently a sore subject with him. `Many an English traveller, signor,' said he, `has asked me about this picture, and again and again have I labored to discover it. It fell into the hands of a dealer in such things, who does not remember how he disposed of it.' So I was obliged to rest content with the legend, and imagine the countenance of her whose strangely melancholy fate so awed the fancy of my childhood. 13* A JOURNEY. 'Tis to join in one sensation Business both and contemplation; Active without toil or stress, Passive without listlessness. Leigh Hunt. Female beauty and fine weather are, by no means, every-day blessings in Italy; but, when there encountered, possess a magical perfection, which at once explains and justifies all the eulogiums bestowed upon the land. And it is the conjunction of these two attractions, which, at some happy hour, imparts a charmed life and interest to the traveller's experience. One of the last of these fortunate occasions I enjoyed, while traversing that beautiful new road, that now extends the whole distance from Pisa to Genoa, sometimes intersecting a fine range of the Appenines, and at frequent intervals, following the shores of the Mediterranean. It was a cloudless and balmy day. Around us were the mountains, and the sea far away to the left, visible from every summit, when halting at a post-house by the road-side, a melody suddenly struck our ears attuned, as it were, to the very spirit of the scene. Music is a great relief to the soul, when filled with the inspiration of Nature; it is the natural language of sentiment, and if at such times, its breathings unexpectedly greet us, they are doubly grateful. The sweet strain which we lingered long to enjoy, proceeded from two peasant girls, who were standing just within the threshold of a neighboring dwelling, accompanying themselves with a guitar. They were gaily arrayed and decked with flowers. I have seldom seen more perfect specimens of rustic beauty. The face of the eldest, indeed, possessed a noble grace which would have adorned a court. Her features were perfectly regular, and seconded her music by the most varying expression. Sometimes one voice rose in a clear, joyous note, and then both mingled in a quick, chanting measure. At length they ceased and smilingly sauntered up the highway. We inquired the meaning of this concert, and were told that these lovely girls were celebrating the return of May, according to a custom in that region. The vocalists are generally selected for their beauty and fine voices, and pass many days, early in the month, going from house to house, to pour forth their hymns. In such usages there is refreshment. They prove that the poetic element has not died out. How true to our better nature is this going forth of the young and fair to welcome with grateful songs, the advent of spring! On this route I fell in with an unusual number of the old soldiers of Napoleon. I have often been struck with the enthusiasm, with which many of the Italians allude to his genius and fate. A priest once hearing me venture some observations respecting him, which in his view, were not quite orthodox, drew me aside, and with the utmost solemnity, assured me it was very sacrilegious to speak so confidently of one who had been commissioned by Heaven to consolidate Europe, to destroy the tyrants of Italy, and unite in a happy and prosperous whole her divided and oppressed states—objects, he added, which would have been admirably accomplished, if Satan had not tempted Buonaparte into Russia. A Genoese captain, who had made several voyages to the East, told me that his ship touched at St. Helena, the very day Napoleon died. He was surprised not to hear the usual gun, and after waiting several hours without receiving the customary visit of inspection, went on shore, and when on returning, he communicated the tidings, every sailor wept! In Romagna, I travelled several days, in the wake of a voiture containing a remarkably agreeable party; and we invariably dined together on the road. During the evening, there was always considerable pleasant conversation, but one old gentleman, who was exceedingly affable to every one else, treated me with the most marked reserve. I puzzled myself, in vain, to account for his conduct, when on the last evening we were together, he happened to become engaged in a controversy with one of the company in regard to some law or custom of England. After a warm discussion, he appealed to me in support of his assertions. I was obliged to confess my utter ignorance of the matter. He regarded me with the utmost surprise, and observed that he could not understand how an Englishman could be unacquainted with the subject. I assured him I had no claims to the title. He seemed very incredulous and begged to know of what country I was. The mention of America, seemed to awaken as lively emotions in his heart as in that of orator Phillips. His expression wholly changed. Throwing back his cloak and deliberately rising from his chair, he approached me with an air of the greatest earnestness: “Sir,” he exclaimed, “forgive me. I have taken you for an Englishman, and have never been able to endure one of that nation, since its dastardly conduct towards Napoleon, under whom I served many years. An American! ah! that is very different. In my garden at Parma, I have placed two busts, which I daily contemplate with perfect admiration,—Michael Angelo, and George Washington;” so saying, he embraced me most cordially, and during the remainder of our journey, atoned for his previous silence, by the most devoted courtesy. At about noon we reached Massa. This is one of the most picturesque of the minor Italian towns. It is nearly surrounded with high mountains, covered thickly with olive-trees. Below lies a pretty vale whose wild fertility is increased by a swift stream coursing through it. On the hill above is an old fortress, and on the shelves of the mountain a cluster of houses. An inscription garlanded with weeds, on the gates, indicates its Roman origin. The principal street is completely grass-grown, and as I wandered there at noon-tide, looking up at the immense government-house, so out of proportion to the town, the echo of my footsteps was startling, and no human being appeared, except here and there, an ancient figure whose white locks, and worn visage harmonized perfectly with the antique and deserted aspect of every thing around. Yet nature smiles benignantly upon this secluded spot. Several rich little gardens and many clusters of orange trees, which here bloom all the year, gave evidence of the peculiar mildness of the air. Completely sheltered by the hills, admirably exposed to the sun, and visited by the breeze from the Mediterranean, of which it commands a beautiful view, one can scarcely imagine a more genial retirement or a scene better adapted for romance, especially as the inn-keeper's daughters have long been justly celebrated for their beauty. The possession of Massa was often warmly contested by the Pisans, Lucchese, Florentines, Genoese, and innumerable princes and bishops. Its castle has been repeatedly besieged. At the present day, quietude and age brood with something of sanctity over the picturesque town; and it reposes in the midst of beauty so serene, that, on a fine summer day, the heart of the returning traveller is beguiled by an unwonted spell, to linger and muse there over his past enjoyments or future prospects, in view of that element which is soon to bear him, perhaps forever, from the time-hallowed and tranquil precincts of the old world. Carrara, which place we reached early in the afternoon, is also begirt and overshadowed by the Appenine. Some of the peaks seemed as bleak and snow-clad as many of the Swiss mountains. In the heavy sides are embedded the apparently inexhaustible quarries of celebrated marble, generally lying in alternate masses of black and white. It is astonishing to observe how little the inventions of modern science have as yet been applied to the working of these quarries. Serious accidents are of frequent occurrence from the fall of rocks, and the road down which they are transported is choked up and rugged in the extreme. The loss of time and damage to the material in consequence, may be easily imagined. The people of Carrara live by their labors, variously directed, in quarrying, sawing and removing the marble, and there are many studios in the town where the rough work of the sculptor is performed, and copies of celebrated statues executed for sale. As I descended from the quarries, and looked around upon the scattered fragments of marble, there was something most interesting and impressive in the thought that from this spot have proceeded the material of those countless creations of the chisel now scattered over the globe. How triumphant is the activity of the human mind! how productive the energies of art! From the rocky sides of these rugged hills, what shapes of beauty and grace have arisen!—the forms of heroes and sages centuries since blended with the dust, the faces of the loved whose mortal lineaments will be seen no more, and creatures of imaginative birth radiant with more than human loveliness. Donatello, Michael Angelo, Canova, Thorwaldsen, Bartolini, and innumerable other gifted names rush upon the heart and associate the mountains of Carrara with noble and lovely forms. We gaze with reverence upon a spot which fancy peoples with an unborn generation of the children of genius. A halo of glory environs the hill-sides whence have gone forth so many enduring symbols of the beautiful and the grand. On reaching Sarzana, at night, it was rather difficult to realize upon refering to the signatures on my passport, that during the day's ride of less than forty miles, I had passed through the territories of five Dukes—a striking evidence of the divided state of Italy. At dawn, the following day, we crossed the Maga in a broad, flat ferry-boat, and as the grey light fell upon a time-tinted village on an adjacent hill, the scene would have furnished a pretty subject for a landscape, including the dingy stream and motley cargo of quaintly-attired travellers, weather-worn peasants and white cattle. On landing, a carriage passed us under the escort of four gen d'armes on horse back, conducting an unfortunate party to the frontiers, who had been discovered travelling without a passport. The scenery grew more rich and variegated until in descending a hill, we came at once in view of the beautiful gulf of Spezia. Upon its finely-cultivated borders, are several low, massive and ancient forts. Not far from the shore a spring of fresh water gushes up through the sea. In the midst of the calm, blue bay, several fishing vessels lay at anchor, distinctly reflected on the water. Along the beach were sauntering dark-visaged men with long red caps, and many sunburnt and savage-looking women, with curions little straw hats, placed coquettishly upon the side of their heads. Everywhere is the sea sublime, its breezes invigorating its music plaintive; but when it flows thus clear and broad to the shores of a southern land, there is an unspeakable charm in its presence. The waves seem to roll with conscious joy to the warm strand, and throw up a shower of sparkling tears as they retreat, and the cool, briny air steals over the fertile and sultry plains like Valor bracing Love. Here some of the happiest months of Shelley's life were spent. He loved to go forth in his boat alone upon this bay and commune with himself in the moonlight. Here he enjoyed during the last year of his existence, the society of a few cherished associates, and here his wife and friends vainly awaited, in agonizing suspense, his return from that fatal expedition to Pisa whither he had gone to welcome Hunt to Italy. It was between the Arno and Serchio that Shelley's boat went down, and on the shore near Via Reggio, that his body was burned under the auspices of Lord Byron. `A restless impulse urged him to embark And meet lone Death on the drear ocean-waste; For well he knew that mighty shadow love The shining caverns of the populous deep.'[2] [2] Alastor. How appropriate to the beach of Spezia are his touching lines, written near Naples:— `I see the deep's untrampled floor With green and purple sea-weed strown: I see the waves upon the shore Like light dissolved in star-showers thrown: I sit upon the sands alone, The lightning of the noontide ocean Is flashing round me, and a tone Arises from its measured motion, How sweet did any heart now share in my emotion.' 14 GENOA. “The ocean-wave thy wealth reflected.” Rogers. `The beauty of an Italian sunset has not been exaggerated either by the pencil of Claude, or the pen of the poets,' I musingly affirmed, while loitering down a long curving declivity, in the twilight of a warm summer evening. The farthest range of hills my eager vision could descry, were bathed in a rich purple, occasionally verging to a dark blue tint, the adjacent sea glowed with saffron hues, while the horizon wore the aspect of molten gold, fading toward the zenith, to a pale amber. The pensive whistle of the vetturino came softened by the distance to my ear. Before me was the far-stretching road, and around the still and lonely hills. A few hours previous, we had left the little town of Borghetti, and on the ensuing day, anticipated repose within the precincts of that city, which enriched with the spoils of a splendid commerce and brilliant maritime adventure, so long boasted the title of superb; that city whose neighborhood gave birth to Columbus, and who prides herself, in these more degenerate times, in having produced the prince of fiddlers. The wide sweeping chain of the Appenines we had traversed, is covered with rough bushes, the most meagre vegetation, and so rock-ribbed as to have rendered the construction of the road an enterprise of extreme difficulty. For a long distance there is no sign of life, but the venerable looking goats clambering about in search of subsistence, and the children that tend them, whose air and faces are painfully significant of premature responsibility. Sometimes we came in sight of the sea, calm as crystal, and dotted with a few distant sails. It was easy to realize the bleak and dangerous ride to which the traveller is here exposed in winter. But the succeeding morning displayed a new and richer vegetation. Aloes and fig-trees, remind one of Sicily, a resemblance which the vicinity of the Mediterranean enhances. The first part of the day's ride, lies along the margin of the water, and afterwards chiefly over verdant hills, which often slope down to the shore. The gulf of Sesto, as you withdraw from it, appears singularly graceful. Its beach has a most symmetrical curve. So placid was the water, that the town of St. Margueritto, seen from above, was perfectly reflected as in a mirror, and the picture resembled a miniature Venice. The scenery throughout the ride, is remarkably variegated; and the garniture of the country sufficiently blended between vegetable gardens, olive and fig orchards, and wild trees to render it pleasingly various. Several grottoes are passed which are plastered over interiorly, in order to prevent the springs from dripping; but the lover of the picturesque, cannot but wish they had been left rough-hewn like those of the Simplon. From the last of these, Genoa is seen far below on the borders of the sea. The view is not comparable with that on approaching it by water. It gives no idea of majesty. Clusters of lemon and orange line the remainder of the way, as well as innumerable villas admirably exposed to the sea-breeze, but as usual, lacking the vicinity of trees—a charm which rural taste can scarcely consent to yield, even though the deficiency is supplied by inviting verandahs. There are decided maritime features, even upon first entering Genoa. The mixed throng, the sun-burnt faces, the garb and even the manners of the lower order, immediately bespeak a sea-port. From the extreme narrowness of the streets, much of the actual beauty and richness of the city is hid from the gaze. Even the numerous palaces do not at first strike the stranger, situated as they frequently are, in thoroughfares so confined as to afford no complete view of their façades. Many a pretty garden and cool arbor is placed upon a roof so lofty, or a terrace so secluded, as to be wholly concealed from observation, yet affording retired and delightful retreats, overlooking the bay, and no less attractive to the meditative recluse or the secret lovers, from being far above the crowd and out of sight of the curious,—the country in the very heart of the city, a garden independent of territory! Many of the peculiarities of Genoa, are fast losing themselves in modern improvements. The streets are widening every year, and carriages, once quite unknown, are coming daily in vogue. There is something here congenial with the alleged sinister tastes of the Italians. The finest caffé is in an obscure street. One is continually stumbling upon luxurious arrangements, and agreeable nooks, where he least expects them; and the narrow lanes, the hue of the marble, and the marine odors bring constantly to mind the rival republic of the Adriatic. The churches are far more rich in frescos and marble, than any other work of art. In that of the Scuola Pia, however, there are some exquisite basso-relievos by a Genoese. In one of them the face of Mary is very sweet and graceful. The palaces are the chief attraction of Genoa. In one we admire the profusion of gold and mirrors, with which the lofty saloons are decorated; in another the magnificent stair-case; here the splendid tints of the marble floor, and there the fine old family portraits. These noble and princely dwellings, eloquently speak to the stranger of the wealth, luxury and taste, which once prevailed here; nor judging by one example, should I imagine that their empire had ceased. Having occasion to seek an old baron well known for his liberal taste, after roaming over his immense garden, till weary of peeping into arbors and temples, I found him in a cool grotto at breakfast with a party of artists. His beautiful domain was once an ancient fortress. All the earth was transported thither, and he has spared no pains to make it a paradise. On every pretty knoll he has placed a bower or statue. Busts of departed sages are reared beside murmuring fountains. One little building is appropriated to his library; another to scientific apparatus. One terrace rises above another, bedecked with rose bushes and fragrant shrubs. From this point you behold a beautiful vista, and from that look down upon the public walk, around upon the city, or far away on the wide blue sea. I would not recommend an 14* asthmatic person to live in Genoa. There is too much climbing necessary in perambulating the streets. The women are often pretty and have in general a Spanish look. Formerly they universally wore the long and graceful white muslin veil flowing backward as the Milanese did the black. Many have now adopted the more artificial style of French costume. The facchini are uncommonly impertinent, and the people for the most part, very saving and quiet, rather proud and generally industrious. Genoa now exports little but silk or velvet, although she continues to furnish the best mariners in the Mediterranean. The Sardinian flag is often seen in the Brazils, and West Indies, though rarely in the East. Among the by-way oddities of the place are the numerous parrots and little naval officers arrayed in the costume of adults, although sometimes only nine years old. In the street of the jewellers, there is a very pretty Madona about two centuries old, the painter of which was killed by his master from jealousy. The jewellers have been offered large sums for this picture, but, considering it as their guardian saint, they will not part with it on any terms. In one of the thoroughfares a tablet perpetuates the infamy of two traitors; and at another angle, as if to atone for the shameful record, an inscription upon an ancient palace, sets forth that it was the gift of Genoa to the brave Admiral Doria, in acknowledgement of his courage and patriotism. Opposite to this interesting monument is the church where the bones of the gallant hero are said to repose. BOLOGNA. What solemn spirit doth inhabit here, What sacred oracle hath here a home? Galt. Italy is a land of contrasts. Its various cities are not only characterized by diversity in the schools of painting and architecture; but the natural scenery, the climate and the dialect and manners of the people are, alone, sufficient strongly to identify the different towns. It is not a little surprising in the view of one habituated to the facilities of communication existing in England and the United States, to witness such striking contrasts between places separated by a space of only one or two hundred miles; and it is to be explained only by recurring to the original distinctions of the different republics, and to the absence of those motives for frequent intercourse which operate so powerfully to equalise and assimilate commercial districts. This contrariety is nowhere more observable than between Florence and Bologna. We leave a city seated in the midst of hills, over whose broad slopes, dotted with gnarled, grey olive trees, are scattered innumerable villas; where our eyes have grown familiar with the airy architecture of the bridges, the massive dome of the cathedral, and the graceful lightness of the campanile; where flower-girls, loitering pedestrians, and gay equipages give life and variety to the scene, in spite of the gloomy style of the palaces, and the unfinished façades of the churches. A few hours are passed in winding amid the Appenines, and we walk the streets of a capital, where long lines of porticos shade the thoroughfares, were a half-barbarous accent destroys the sweetness of the language, and a certain moroseness marks the manners of the people. There is certainly a kind of natural language in cities as well as in individuals, an inexplicable influence, which produces a spontaneous impression upon our minds. Otherwise, why is it that so many continental sojourners feel perfectly at home in the Tuscan metropolis, and quite out of their element in many other cities of Italy, boasting more interesting society, and a more agreeable round of amusements? In the passage of the Appenines, a lover of mountain scenery will not be without the means of enjoyment. The picturesque defiles and wild ranges, the barren peaks and fertile slopes, the pebly dells and broad undulations, though on a comparatively small scale as regards grandeur, are yet sufficiently pleasing to yield that sweet charm to the imagination which such scenery is fitted to inspire. The only remarkable object of natural curiosity encountered in the route is a species of volcano. It was a beautiful evening when we left the miserable village where we were to lodge, and sought this singular spot. We were in the very midst of the Appenines. The air was cool and bracing, and over the western horizon, lingered the rich, rosy glow that succeeds a fine sunset, as if the portals of heaven were half-opened to the longing gaze. Along the rocky path above us, several peasant girls were carrying vases of water on their heads from a favorite spring, singing as they went, and their clear voices came with a kind of wild melody to our ears. The whole scene was calculated to convey that soothing idea of the repose of pastoral life, which, at intervals, fascinates even those least inclined to solitude. We found the object of our search in the midst of a stony soil. Flames, evidently of ignited gas, issued from the ground in a circle of about ten feet in diameter. About the centre, the largest flame was red, and burned steadily; but the others were of a pale violet color and quivered incessantly, seeming to creep along the ground as the night breeze swept over them. In truth the appearance of the fire was precisely that which we might imagine of the magic circle of some ancient sorcerer; and the dreary loneliness of the spot seemed finely adapted to the idea. The flames burn more brightly after a rain, but no one in the neighborhood, recollects any particular change in the volcano. It has never been known to disgorge sulphurous matter, or exhibit any different phenomena than at present; but ever burns with a constant and apparently inextinguishable fire. Porticos line all the principal streets of Bologna; and however convenient their shelter may prove to a pedestrian on a rainy day, it requires no little time for the stranger to become reconciled to the sombre impression they prodace. The most extensive line of these arches is that which leads from the city to the Church of St. Luke, a distance of three miles. The promenade on a fine day, displays at every turn, beautiful views of the surrounding plains; and the elevated position of the temple of the patron saint of the Bolognese, approached by such a noble range of porticos, strikes the traveller as a well conceived idea. The passion for this style of building has extended to many of the adjacent towns, and the three first tiers of the spacious threatre of Bologna present the same favorite form. The gloomy aspect of this species of street architecture, is enhanced by the solitude that prevails in many parts of this extensive town;—and late in the evening, when the lamps shed a dazzling light at intervals through the long and silent vistas of the less frequented ways, a scenic effect is produced favorable to romantic impressions. I remember being struck, upon entering the city after night-fall by one of its most solitary gates, with the picture formed by a decrepid and withered old woman, seated at the foot of one of the pillars of a dark portico, roasting chesnuts. The lurid glare of her charcoal fire shot up, in fitful flashes to the top of the arch, bringing her haggard features into strong relief, while all around was involved in deep shade. Perhaps the most impressive of the traveller's experience in this unprepossessing city, is the view from the summit of the old leaning tower in the piazza, and two or three of the faces depicted on the inspired canvass of the old masters in the academy. The eye of Raphael's St. Cecilia, the expression of some of the figures in the celebrated “Massacre of the Innocents,” and especially the upturned and beaming look of Guido's Magdalen crouched at the foot of the cross, haunt the imagination long after the eye has ceased to behold them. Sir Joshua Reynolds always urged his scholars to make a long sojourn at Bologna. The most annoying feature in the present aspect of this city, is the presence of the Austrian troops, sputtering their gutturals in the caffés, parading beneath the arcades, and drawn up in files in the saloon of the theatre. Everywhere one encounters the insignia of military despotism, and, perhaps, to a liberal mind the most painful associations are derived from the appearance of some of the fine-looking Swiss officers—sons of the mountains and recipients of nobler political influences than their fellows, and yet content to be the hireling oppressors of a foreign soil. One of the richest palaces in Bologna, belongs to Bacciochi, who espoused the sister of Napoleon, and there is scarcely one of its splendid apartments unadorned with some memorial of his person or life. Here is a portrait exhibiting the free and fresh expression of irresponsible youth; there the same brow appears shaded by a military cap or glittering coronet; here that extraordinary countenance is exquisitely delineated upon a small surface of ivory, and there elaborately carved in the centre of a pietra dura table. In the centre of a richly-curtained cabinet is his bust by Canova; over the fire-place of a silken-hung bed room, is his head encircled by rays; and on the damask walls of the magnificent saloon, hangs his full length portrait, splendidly arrayed in coronation robes. In another apartment, we behold his statue in marble, surrounded by those of his family; and on a slab, in an adjoining room, we gaze on the same remarkable features fixed in the still rigidity of death, in the form of a bronze cast taken after his decease. It is enough to temper the eagerness of the veriest enthusiast in pursuit of glory, to wander through this quiet, lofty and elegantly decorated palace, and as his eye rests upon these memorials, call to mind successively the most wonderful epochs of Napoleon's life. He seems almost to move before us, as the drama of his memorable career is acted rapidly out in the imagination. We remember his early achievements, his startling victories, his suddenly acquired empire, the grandeur of his projects, the immense sacrifice attending their fulfilment, and, at length, the waning of his proud star—his fall, exile, and death. How brief a period has sufficed to transfer the deeds of Europe's modern conqueror to the calm sphere of history, and enthrone his terrible name amid the undreaded though solemn past! Enterprise and genuis in most of the departments of human effort meet with so little pecuniary encouragement in Italy, that they almost invariably excite sympathy for the ill-rewarded toil of the votary. An exception to this rule I witnessed in Bologna, in the person of Rossini, the composer, whose operas continue to yield him a handsome income. But a case more in accordance with the prevailing spirit, is that of a Bolognese physician, who, for several years, was attached to the military service in Greece and Egypt. While in Nubia, at great expense, and with incredible fatigue and danger, he succeeded in excavating a pyramid, and bringing away the contents of a sarcophagus which he discovered within. According to the opinion of the most esteemed archeologists whom he has consulted, this pyramid was erected seven hundred years before the Christian era, by King Tahraka. The collection consists chiefly of ornaments of the finest gold —rings, bracelets, and neck-laces, upon which are wrought the various devices and emblems of Egyptian lore. Many of these are exceedingly curious, and different from those previously known. But the most singular circumstance attending this excavation is, that among the articles disinterred is a cameo, representing a head of Minerva, executed in a style altogether beyond the epoch in the history of art, from which the other objects evidently date. In fact, there are obvious indications that the stone is of Grecian workmanship. The only satisfactory solution which has been given to this problem, is that the pyramid although commenced during the reign of Tahraka, was not completed until after an interval of three hundred years—a supposition which is confirmed by the difference observable in the angle and quality of the stones. This valuable collection still remains upon the hands of the enterprising excavator, although it so richly merits a place in some public museum, for which object it would doubtless be purchased—as the poor physician regretfully declared —if it had been his lot to be a native of England or France, instead of impoverished Italy. One of the most remarkable of Catholic fertivals— called the Day of the Dead—occurred on the loveliest day 15 of my brief sojourn in Bologna. Nature breathed any language rather than that of mortality and decay. The road leading to the celebrated Campo Santo was thronged with people walking beneath the glad sky, in holiday attire; and there would have been one universal semblance of gaiety, but for the moaning tones and wretched appearance of the beggars that lined the way. The numerous arcades of the extensive burying place resounded with the hum, bustle, and exclamations of a careless crowd, who moved about like the multitude at a fair. But for the countless busts of departed worthies, the numberless inscriptions, and the echoes of the mass floating from one of the open chapels, it would have been impossible to believe, that this concourse had assembled ostensibly to remember and honor the dead. To the view of a stranger nothing could be more incongruous or strange than the scene. The cypresses and cenotaphs assured him he was in a burial place; while every moment he was jostled by a hurrying group, and his ears saluted with peals of discordant laughter, the leering whisper of the courtezan, and the stern reproof of the soldier. And yet in his answer to the inquiries which curiosity promotes, he is told that this day is conse crated to the departed, that this throng have assembled to think of, and pray for them, and that these tapers are placed by surviving friends around the tombs of the loved and lost. There was something jarring to every nerve, something that mocked every hallowed association in this rude contrast between the solemn emblems of death, and the eager recklessness of life. I suggested the idea of inexorable and unmitigable destiny, rather than consoling faith. It was redolent of bitterness and despair. It was as if men would confront the dark doom of mortality with hollow laughter and raillery. So, at least, the scene impressed one spectator, to whom it was new; yet habit, or their peculiar creed, had apparently associated it in the minds of the multitude with no such shocking suggestions. It was affecting to notice, here and there, a monument unilluminated—perhaps that of a stranger, who died unhonored and unsoothed, or the ancient mausoleum of such who could claim kindred with the place and the people, but whose memories inexorable time had consigned to the dark abyss of forgetfulness. LUCCA. “In the deep umbrage of the olive's shade.” Childe Harold. The Lucchese look upon the mountains. Does not this, in some measure, account for their love of liberty? It may seem rather more fanciful than philosophic, but one can scarcely perambulate, on a fine day, the delightful promenade, which surrounds the walls, and gaze on the adjacent hills, without realizing, as it were, in the tenor of his musings, something of the elevated and inspiring sentiment, so beautifully typified by their green and graceful loftiness. `High mountains are a feeling;' and were we to analyse the emotions they excite, surely the sense of freedom would be prominent among them. Not less in the spirit of wisdom than of poetry, should we found a city among the hills. Let the souls of men grow familiar with their sky-pointing summits, their blue waving lines, the dark hugeness of their forms at night-fall, and the rosy vestment thrown around them by the morning. It was not an accidental combination that made the Alps Tell's birth-place, or planted the home of Hofer in the midst of the Tyrol. Originally a Roman colony, Lucca, in the middle ages, was repeatedly bartered away by successive masters, in consequence of the liberal principles of her inhabitants, until she succeeded while in the possession of Florence, in purchasing her freedom of Charles IV, for two hundred thousand guilders. One of her first self-created rulers was Castruccio, a warrior pre-eminent for consummate bravery; and, although involved in numerous wars, she maintained her independence till the time of Napoleon. It was a happy circumstance for the Lucchese, that the Emperor's sister who virtually governed them, had learned from her brother Lucien while in Paris, to love and respect the cause of Poetry and the Arts. Elise delighted in exhibiting this new-born taste, by a generous patronage of genius; and the traveller meets with many affecting proofs of the attachment in which her memory is still held by the people. Well do the inhabitants of this little duchy, deserve the appellative so long, by general consent, bestowed on them, of the industrious. Fields of flax, and vegetable patches of the most promising aspect, indicate to the stranger his vicinity to Lucca. A rocky vein of soil and many cliff-like hills affords genial ground for the olive, and a certain superior quality in the fruit or peculiar care exercised in the manufacture, renders the oil here produced, preferable to that of any other district in Italy. Within a few years, fortunes have been made by the fabrication of paper and silk. The hangings of the Palace, indeed, furnish a striking proof of the degree of excellence 15* attained in the latter branch. This edifice is far more rich, however, in works of art. There is a picture by Annibal Carraci, representing the Woman taken in Adultery. An expression of profound sorrow and benevolence illumes the Saviour's countenance. Hehas risen from the stooping posture he had assumed in the presence of the malignant accusers, and seems just to have dismissed the woman who, kneeling at his feet, is gazing despairingly upon his face. Her eyes are full of eloquent sorrow. We can almost see the tears; but her anguish is evidently too deep for weeping, while something like the light of hope mingles with and beautifies her expression; as if his forgiving accent had already fallen upon ner soul. In the same apartment hangs another painting remarkable for effective coloring—Christ before Pilate, by Gerardo delle Notti. The rays of a candle shine up on the sharp Jewish features of the judge, and from amid the dark shadows of the back-ground, beam forth, in calm majesty, the serene lineaments of the accused. The capo d'opera of this collection is a Holy Family by Raphael, which some might be pardoned for esteeming above the more celebrated one of the Pitti palace. The mother's face is certainly more strictly Italian, and nothing can be more sweetly eloquent than her downcast eyes meekly bent upon the clinging child. Angelica Kaufman, who learned painting from her father, and so speedily surpassed him in skill, is said to have greatly preferred ideal female figures, and, as her point of excellence was grace, they were doubtless best adapted to her pencil. She found, however, in real life, an admirable subject, in the person of Amarilla Etrusca, an admired improvisatrice, whose portrait taken at the moment of inspiration, graces the Ducal gallery. It is a delightful and by no means a common occurrence, in the annals of the arts, for one gifted woman thus to celebrate another. The most renowned picture, however, at present existing here, is the Assumption, by Fra Bartolomeo, in the Dominican convent. A young artist from Rome, patronised by the Duke, was my cicerone at Lucca, and, after viewing the palace, we adjourned to his studio, to look over his designs. Some of these indicate no ordinary talent. One of them illustrates an instance of sudden vengeance recorded in the history of Tuscany. Cosmo de Medici, as the story runs, having discovered an intrigue between his wife and a page, sent for a priest and executioner, and when all was ready, called her into the apartment, made known his discovery, and giving a signal, the favorite was murdered before her eyes. The moment chosen, is when the enraged husband, having displayed an intercepted letter, is uttering the fatal word. The scene was most vividly sketched by the young painter—the deep but diverse emotions of the several parties, being most strongly depicted in their attitudes and expression. But the period of my sojourn at Lucca, was not altogether favorable to a quiet and leisure survey of her attractions. It was the anniversary of a triennial festa in a neighboring town, and the inviting weather, and cheerful faces of the throng swarming the gate, were enough to lure even a passing traveller along the road to Pescia, the birth-place of Sismondi. The contadini of this and the adjacent villages crowded the streets. The men's faces were generally sallow, or very brown from exposure to the sun; and those which age had stamped with furrows, and shaded with gray locks, resemble the impressive heads so often introduced in the pictures of the old masters. The female peasants have the same sun-burnt appearance, being equally accustomed to work in the fields. They wore enormous gold and silver ornaments, often preserving, in this form, all their superfluous earnings. On this occasion, too, their best mantillas were in requisition, of a snowy whiteness, and frequently embroidered with no little taste. This simple, but most becoming head dress, is in beautiful contrast with their olive complexions and raven hair. It is a charming pastime for a native of the North, to thread such an assemblage of the rustic fair of the South. Sometimes a face is encountered, so bland, innocent, and passively beautiful, but for the rich jet eyes, as to revive the sweet impressions which poetry inspires, of what an English poet considers the most divine coincidence in existence—`a lovely woman in a rural spot.' To give variety to the otherwise pastoral aspect of the scene, here and there, some exquisite from an adjacent city, loiters along, and the venders endeavor to call attention to their stalls, by loud and various cries. Nuts, cheap toys, and pastry, comprise their merchandise. And what are the ostensible amusements of such a concourse? What spell preserves amid such a heterogeneous mass, so much order and mutual courtesy? Whence the charm that gives rise to such merry peals of laughter, that arrays so many faces with gladness? Nature, indeed, smiles upon them; but they seldom know her frowns. Doubtless, there is much delight in the simple dolce far niente, much spontaneous joy in the social excitement of the scene, to which the Italians of every class are peculiarly susceptible. A festa in Italy, however, must ever be more or less of a mystery to one wedded to a cold philosophy. And yet I pity the man who can roam through such a village, at such a season, and not breathe more freely, and catch a ray of pleasure from the light-hearted triflers around him. He may be wise; he must be heartless. The festa of Pescia was ushered in, as usual, by a religious ceremonial. The principal church was arrayed in crimson and gold, and illuminated with hundreds of tapers. Mass was performed, and, for several hours, a choir and an orchestra made the vaulted roof resound with sacred melody. No peasant seemed satisfied till his brow was moistened with the holy water, and his knees had pressed the steps of the altar. The responses once uttered, and the benediction received, they hastened again into the open air, to chat with their fellows from the adjoining district, or treat some favorite maiden to an ice. In the afternoon, they flocked into the main street, to see a race. Three or four horses, without riders, decked out in gilt paper, and with briars shaking at their sides, are started from a certain point. The crowd part before them, and shout to quicken their career. No drunkenness is seen, and the only apparent excess, is that of harmless buffoonery. An illumination closed the festa. In the evening, every window was studded with lights, and as they gleamed upon the throng below, the village lost every trace of its homely and every-day aspect, and seemed a spot consecrated to romance. Then, all the women appeared beautiful. The hum of conversation swelled upon the night-breeze, Laughter echoed through the streets. Children danced over the pavement in transport. Old men walked slowly, smiling to their friends. Lovers side by side, grew bold in their endearments. Jokes were bandied freely. All deemed the hour one of those lapses in the monotonous tide of life, when the deep of existence ripples sportively, lulling to momentary oblivvion all bitter memories, and throwing nought but bright sparkles on the sands of time. Amid the surrounding hills, from the shadowy olive-woods, numberless lamps twinkled in fantastic groups. On their summits, lights were arranged in the form of crosses. The sacred symbol glittered thus from afar, like the vision of Constantine in the sky. On the churches, the lamps followed the lines of the architect, making them appear like temples built of stars. And above all, in the midst of the solemn firmament, the full moon sailed in unclouded beauty, as if to smile upon and hallow the transient reign of human festivity. LEAF FROM A LOG. `Once more upon the waters!' Childe Harold. Pictures of sea-life generally present the two extremes of truth. When drawn by the professional mariner, the shadows are often kept wholly out of view, and when depicted by one to whom the element itself and all the associations of shipboard are uncongenial, we have Dr. Johnson's summary opinion re-echoed with the endorsement of experience. Life at sea, as everywhere else, is a chequered scene. Nothing can exceed the melancholy of a cloudy day on the ocean, to the heart of one fresh from endeared localities. The grey sky, the chilly air and the boundless, dark mass of water rolling in sullen gloom, fill the mind with sombre images. And when night comes over the deep and the voyager retires to his cabin, to muse over the friends and sweet places of the earth left behind,—the creaking of the strained timbers, the swaying of the flickering lamp, and the gurgling of the waves at the stern, deepen the desolate sensations that weigh upon his heart. On the other hand, what can give more buoyancy to the spirits than a bright, clear day at sea, when with a fair wind and every sail filled, the noble vessel rushes gallantly through the water? It must be confessed, however, that there are few occasions of more keen enjoyment than going on shore, after a long voyage. Life seems renewed, and old impressions become fresh when the loneliness of the ocean is all at once exchanged for the busy haunts of men, the narrow deck for the crowded street, the melancholy expanse of waves for the variegated garniture of earth. When naught has met the eye for many weeks but sea and sky, when the social excellencies of a party have been too largely drawn upon to be keenly relished, and the novelties of voyaging have become familiar, the hour of landing is anticipated with an eagerness only to be realized by experience. It was with no little impatience that we awaited the lawn after casting anchor in the bay of Gibraltar. In his instance delay was more irksome, as our arrangements precluded more than a day's sojourn on the celebrated rock. We found the town in a state of unusual excitement from a report which was current, of the near approach of the troops of Don Carlos. The people of Saint Roque, the nearest Spanish town, were flocking into the gates, many of the poorer classes laden with their household effects. Never, to me, were the contrasts between sea and land more striking. The wild cry of the mariners had scarcely died away upon our ears, when they were greeted with the hum of commerce, and the enlivening strains of martial music. As we proceeded, groups of Jews were seen moving towards the synagogue, their dark robes and grey beards blending with the bright uniforms of the English officers who gravely trod the crowded pavement. A swarthy peasant with a steeple-crowned hat, was violently beating his mules in the middle of the street, while directly under the wall, a Spanish lady, with graceful steps, glided on to mass. But our attention was soon completely absorbed in a survey of the fortifications. Many hours were spent in clambering over the rock, now pausing to note the picturesque aspect of a Moorish castle, and now to admire the marvellous vegetation of a little garden, planted on a narrow shelf of the fortress. Here a luxuriant aloe threw up its blue and spear-like leaves above the grey stone; and there, a venerable goat was perched motionless upon a projecting cliff. We wandered through the extensive galleries cut in the solid rock, one moment struck with the immense resources of nature, and the next, delighted by some admirable device of art. The light streaming the loop-holes, the large dark cannon, and the extraordinary number and extent of these galleries, fill the mind with a kind of awe. At one of the most central points, we paused and gazed down upon the bay. Our vessel seemed dwindled to the size of a pleasure-boat. Opposite, appeared the town of Algeciras, and immediately below, the neutral land between the Spanish and British territory. This is the duelling-ground of the garrison, and near by is a cluster 16 of graves. The water was covered with foam. The wind swept with a melancholy roar round the immense rock. Our voices echoed through the long, vaulted archway. As we clustered about the cannon, looking forth from that dizzy height upon the extensive prospect, while our guide rehearsed the capabilities of the position, and pointed out the memorable points of the landscape, we fully realized the impregnable strength of Gibraltar. Before dusk we were under way, and rounding the majestic rock, soon lost sight of its scattered lights and huge form towering through the twilight. The American Consul bade us adieu at the pier, and the facilities he had afforded us during the day, led me to reflect upon the importance of this office abroad, and the singular neglect of our government to its claims. Politicians, among us, are so absorbed in temporary questions and immediate objects, that it is difficult to attract their attention to any foreign interest. Yet, in a patriotic point of view, there are few subjects more worthy of the consideration of political reformers, than our consular system. Of the utter indifference with which these offices are regarded, there are many evidences. A very gentlemanly man who had fulfilled the duties of United States Consul, at one of the Mediterranean ports, for more than twenty years, was waited upon one morning, by a stranger, who demanded the seal and books of the consulate, showing a commission empowering him to fill the station. Common decency, to say nothing of civility, would require that this gentleman should have received some official notice of his expulsion. But the most curious circumstance in the case was, that, after a month had elapsed, the new consul renewed his call, and stating he found the fees inadequate to his support, destroyed his commission, and departed. Another old incumbent, deservedly popular, discovered, for the first time, through the public prints, that his office had been abolished for more than a year. At present, these offices are chiefly held by merchants, whose personal interests are continually liable to conflict with their duty as public servants. Our consuls, too, usually depend upon fees for remuneration, and a large part of these are paid by travellers. Those who make several successive visits to the same city, paying, at each departure, for the consul's signature to their passports, cannot but feel annoyed at a tax from which other strangers are exempt. If salaries were instituted, proportioned to the labor and importance of each station, and liberal enough to secure the services of able men, the result, in every point of view, would be excellent. Generous and enlightened views of national intercourse, are now rapidly prevailing, and our country should be the first to give them a practical influence. The French system is progressive, and the consuls are, therefore, regularly educated for their duty. The English consuls are accustomed to furnish the home-department with useful statistica' information, which is of eminent service to the merchant manfacturer, and political economist. If these inquiries were extended to scientific and other general subjects, it is easy to perceive how extensively useful the consular office might become. If there is any country, which, in the present condition of the world, should be worthily represented, it is the United States. The extent of our commercial relations, and the rapid increase of American travellers require it; but the honor of a young and prosperous nation, and fidelity to the important principles of freedom and popular education we profess, are still higher reasons. Men of intelligence and observation, who shall command the respect of their countrymen, and of the courts to which they are sent, should be placed at these posts of duty. Party feeling should be waived in such appointments. They should be regarded not merely as affording protection and facilitating intercourse, but as involving high responsibility, and furnishing occasion for various usefulness. Our consuls should have the interests of their country at heart, not only as diplomatists but, if possible, as men of literature and science, and, at all events, as enlightened and generous patriots. Day after day, we proceeded constantly in view of the Spanish coast. It was delightful, at early morning, to trace the fine outline of the mountains, broken, occasionally, by a watch-tower, or, at sunset, behold the rich glow gather upon their summits, and suffuse their misty robes with beautiful hues. The still grandeur of the hills of Spain thus bathed in softened tints, was in striking contrast to the civil feud then devastating the country. Leaning over the bulwarks, I loved to gaze upon these magnificent boundaries of a chivalrous land, and muse upon the decayed splendor of the Alhambra, the rich humor of Don Quixote, or the wrongs and triumphs of Columbus. On a clear and delightful morning, we came in view of Malta. Perhaps there is no spot of such diminutive extent, that can boast an equal renown. Although a mere calcareous rock, its commanding position early attracted the arms of the Cathagenians, who were dispossessed by the Romans. The island was occupied, in the middle ages, by the Saracens and Normans, and in 1530, conferred, by Charles V., upon the knights of Saint John, who had been expelled from Rhodes by the Turks. Thenceforth, Malta exhibited a new aspect. Fortifications of great extent and admirable construction arose. The one small stream of fresh water was carried to Valetta by an acqueduct of a thousand arches. The noble church dedicated to the patron saint of the order arose. A hospital was built to accommodate two thousand patients, and the vessels used in its service, were of solid silver. Earth from Sicily, was spread over the rock, which soon presented tints of lively green to contrast with the greyish-yellow hue of the forts, and the deep blue of the sea. As we were not permitted immediately to land, I had ample opportunity to contemplate the interesting scene. Several vessels of war were lying in the harbor, their large, dark hulls casting broad and imposing shadows. The castles of Saint Angelo and Saint Elmo, presented their batteries at opposite angles, reviving the associations of the memorable sieges which the knights so courageously sustained. On one of these occasions, when the position of the enemy intervened between the two forts, their situation is described as trying in the extreme. The waves were dyed with blood. The bodies of the knights who perished at Saint Elmo, floated to the foot of Saint Angelo, and were buried there. Many of them were horribly 16* mangled, and the cross cut in derision upon their breasts. At night, the fire wheels and other engines, illuminated the scene of battle. The brave champions of Christianity, met, for the last time, in their council hall, wounded and spent with fatigue, and, having partaken of the last religious rite, vowed to sacrifice themselves, and return once more to the defence. When the moon arose, and poured her tranquil light upon the harbor, its peaceful beauty rendered such retrospections more difficult to realize. The water rippled playfully around the mossy walls of the forts. The mild lustre fell serenely upon the tile covered roofs of the town, and bathed the lofty dome of the Cathedral. The crowd passed cheerfully along the quay, and the echo of a mariner's song alone disturbed the silence of night. Now and then a boat shot across the bay with its complement of passengers—a priest, a soldier, and one or two female figures, shrouded in black silk. It was impossible to peruse the scene and not revert to those fierce struggles between the crescent and the cross, and dwell upon the devoted enthusiasm which led so many of the young and the brave to assume the black mantle and holy symbol of Christian knighthood. The inspiration of a Southern night aided the imagination in conjuring from the bosom of the quiet waters, the buried tales of romantic valor. Such dreams were soon dispelled upon landing, for the Nix Mangare stairs leading to the town, are always thronged with the most importunate beggars. In the principal street, some laborers were digging the foundation of a house. The cellar is made by merely throwing out the calcareous soil which forms very good material for building. When used, however, for floors, it is necessary to harden the surface of the Malta stone with varnish or oil. A friend of mine, at Palermo, who paved his house with this material, and neglected thus to prepare it, discovered his mistake in a very unpleasant manner. Soon after taking possession of his residence, he gave a ball. After the third or fourth dance, the gentlemen's coats were white with powder, the air of the rooms was filled with fine dust, and the next day, every one of the company complained of a sore throat. We lodged at a hotel, formerly a knight's palace, every apartment of which is of noble dimensions, and richly decorated. The Grand Master's residence, the splendid armory, the long lines of bastions, and the monuments in the church of Saint John, are the most interesting memorials of the knights. The old pits excavated for preserving grain, which has been thus kept for an entire century, are still used for a similar purpose. A column on one of the ramparts, commemorates the services of Sir Alexander Ball, to whom Coleridge pays so high a tribute in the Friend. The gay uniforms of the English officers give a lively air to the narrow streets of Malta. At the opera, between the acts, the orchestra perform “God save the King,” and every individual rises and remains attentively standing until the music ceases This silent recognition of national feeling, in a foreign land is impressive and touching. Malta will not long detain the curious traveller, when so near more interesting localities. But while the novelty of its peculiar features is fresh to the mind, they cannot fail to amuse. There is a remarkable unity in the associations of the place, connected as they are, almost exclusively with the knights. A great variety in costume, and sundry singularities in the habits and dialects of the natives, afford a fund of entertainment for a few days' sojourn. The Maltese still complain loudly of their grievances, and have but recently succeeded in obtaining the freedom of their press. Their African origin is strongly indicated in their complexions and cast of features. Yet not unfrequently, from one of the grotesque balconies, a dark eye gleams, or a form is visible, which stays the steps, and provokes the sigh of the stranger.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THOUGHTS ON THE POETS. GOLDSMITH. It is sometimes both pleasing and profitable to recur to those characters in literary history who are emphatically favorites, and to glance at the cause of their popularity. Such speculations frequently afford more important results than the mere gratification of curiosity. They often lead to a clearer perception of the true tests of genius, and indicate the principle and methods by which the common mind may be most successfully addressed. The advantage of such retrospective inquiries is still greater at a period like the present, when there is such an obvious tendency to innovate upon some of the best established theories of taste; when the passion for novelty seeks for such unlicensed indulgence, and invention seems to exhaust itself rather upon forms than ideas. In literature, especially, we appear to be daily losing one of the most valuable elements—simplicity. The prevalent taste is no longer gratified with the natural. There is a growing appetite for what is startling and peculiar, seldom accompanied by any discriminating demand for the true and original; and yet, experience has fully proved that these last are the only permanent elements of literature; and no healthy mind, cognizant of its own history, is unaware that the only intellectual aliment which never palls upon the taste, is that which is least indebted to extraneous accompaniments for its relish. It is ever refreshing to revert to first principles. The study of the old masters may sometimes make the modern artist despair of his own efforts; but if he have the genius to discover, and follow out the great principle upon which they wrought, he will not have contemplated their works in vain. He will have learned that devotion to nature is the grand secret of progress in art, and that the success of her votaries depends upon the singleness, constancy, and intelligence of their worship. If there is not enthusiasm enough to kindle this flame in its purity, nor energy sufficient to fulfil the sacrifice required at that high altar, let not the young aspirant enter the priesthood of art. When the immortal painter of the Transfiguration was asked to embody his ideal of perfect female loveliness, he replied—there would still be an infinite distance between his work and the existent original. In this profound and vivid perception of the beautiful in nature, we perceive the origin of those lovely creations, which, for more than three hundred years, have delighted mankind. And it is equally true of the pen as the pencil, that what is drawn from life and the heart, alone bears the impress of immortality. Yet the practical faith of our day is diametrically opposed to this truth. The writers of our times are constantly making use of artificial enginery. They have, for 17 the most part, abandoned the integrity of purpose and earnest directness of earlier epochs. There is less faith, as we before said, in the natural; and when we turn from the midst of the forced and hot bed products of the modern school, and ramble in the garden of old English literature, a cool and calm refreshment invigorates the spirit, like the first breath of mountain air to the weary wayfarer. There are few writers of the period more generally beloved than Dr. Goldsmith. Of his contemporaries, Burke excelled him in splendor of diction, and Johnson in depth of thought. The former continues to enjoy a larger share of admiration, and the latter of respect, but the labors of their less pretending companion have secured him a far richer heritage of love. Of all posthumous tributes to genius, this seems the most truly desirable. It recognizes the man as well as the author. It is called forth by more interesting characteristics than talent. It bespeaks a greater than ordinary association of the individual with his works, and looking beyond the mere embodiment of his intellect, it gives assurance of an attractiveness in his character which has made itself felt even through the artificial medium of writing. The authors are comparatively few, who have awakened this feeling of personal interest and affection. It is common, indeed, for any writer of genius to inspire emotions of gratitude in the breasts of those susceptible to the charm, but the instances are rare in which this sentiment is vivified and elevated into positive affection. And few, I apprehend, among the wits and poets of old England, have more widely awakened it than Oliver Goldsmith. I have said this kind of literary fame was eminently desirable. There is, indeed, something inexpressibly touching in the thought of one of the gifted of our race, attaching to himself countless hearts by the force of a charm woven in by-gone years, when environed by neglect and discouragement. Though a late, it is a beautiful recompense, transcending mere critical approbation, or even the reverence men offer to the monuments of mind. We can conceive of no motive to effort which can be presented to a man of true feeling, like the hope of winning the love of his kind by the faithful exhibition of himself. It is a nobler purpose than that entertained by heartless ambition. The appeal is not merely to the judgment and imagination, it is to the universal heart of mankind. Such fame is emphatically rich. It gains its possessor warm friends instead of mere admirers. To establish such an inheritance in the breast of humanity, were indeed worthy of sacrifice and toil. It is an offering not only to intellectual but to moral graces, and its possession argues for the sons of fame holier qualities than genius itself. It eloquently indicates that its subject is not only capable of interesting the general mind by the power of his creations, but of captivating the feelings by the earnest beauty of his nature. Of all oblations, therefore, we deem it the most valuable. It is this sentiment with which the lovers of painting regard the truest interpreters of the art. They wonder at Michael Angelo but love Raphael, and gaze upon the pensively beautiful delineation he has left us of himself, with the regretful tenderness with which we look upon the portrait of a departed friend. The devotees of music, too, dwell with glad astonishment upon the celebrated operas of Rosini and some of the German composers, but the memory of Bellini is absolutely loved. It is well remarked by one of Goldsmith's biographers, that the very fact of his being spoken of always with the epithet “poor” attached to his name, is sufficient evidence of the kind of fame he enjoys. Whence, then, the peculiar attraction of his writings, and wherein consists the spell which has so long rendered his works the favorites of so many and such a variety of readers? The primary and all-pervading charm of Goldsmith is his truth. It is interesting to trace this delightful characteristic, as it exhibits itself not less in his life than in his writings. We see it displayed in the remarkable frankness which distinguished his intercourse with others, and in that winning simplicity which so frequently excited the contemptuous laugh of the worldly-wise, but failed not to draw towards him the more valuable sympathies of less perverted natures. All who have sketched his biography unite in declaring, that he could not dissemble; and we have a good illustration of his want of tact in concealing a defect, in the story which is related of him at the time of his unsuccessful attempt at medical practice in Edinburgh—when, his only velvet coat being deformed by a huge patch on the right breast, he was accustomed, while in the drawing room, to cover it in the most awkward manner with his hat. It was his natural truthfulness which led him to so candid and habitual a confession of his faults. Johnson ridiculed him for so freely describing the state of his feelings during the representation of his first play; and, throughout his life, the perfect honesty of his spirit made him the subject of innumerable practical jokes. Credulity is perhaps a weakness almost inseparable from eminently truthful characters. Yet, if such is the case, it does not in the least diminish our faith in the superiority and value of such characters. Waiving all moral considerations, we believe it can be demonstrated that truth is one of the most essential elements of real greatness, and surest means of eminent success. Management, chicanery and cunning, may advance men in the career of the world; it may forward the views of the politician, and clear the way of the diplomatist. But when humanity is to be addressed in the universal language of genius; when, through the medium of literature or art, man essays to reach the heart of his kind, the more sincere the appeal, the surer its effect; the more direct the call, the deeper the response. In a word, the more largely truth enters into a work, the more certain the fame of its author. But a few months since, I saw the Parisian populace crowding around the church where the remains of Talleyrand lay in state, but the fever of curiosity alone gleamed from their eyes, undimmed by tears. When Goldsmith died, Reynolds, then in the full tide of success, threw his pencil aside in sorrow, and Burke turned from the fast-brightening vision of renown, to weep. Truth is an endearing quality. None are so beloved as the ingenuous. We feel in approaching them that the look of welcome is unaffected—that the friendly grasp is from the heart, and we regret their departure as an actual 17* loss. And not less winningly shines this high and sacred principle through the labours of genius. It immortalizes history—it is the true origin of eloquence, and constitutes the living charm of poetry. When Goldsmith penned the lines— To me more dear, congenial to my heart, One native charm than all the gloss of art, he furnished the key to his peculiar genius, and recorded the secret which has embalmed his memory. It was the clearness of his own soul which reflected so truly the imagery of life. He did but transcribe the unadorned convictions that glowed in his mind, and faithfully traced the pictures which nature threw upon the mirror of his fancy. Hence the unrivalled excellence of his descriptions. Rural life has never found a sweeter eulogist. To countless memories have his village landscapes risen pleasantly, when the “murmur” rose at eventide. Where do we not meet with a kind-hearted philosopher delighting in some speculative hobby, equally dear as the good Vicar's theory of Monogamy? The vigils of many an ardent student have been beguiled by his portraiture of a country clergyman—brightening the dim vista of futurity as his own ideal of destiny; and who has not, at times, caught the very solace of retirement from his sweet apostrophe? The genius of Goldsmith was chiefly fertilized by observation. He was not one of those who regard books as the only, or even the principal sources of knowledge He recognised and delighted to study the unwritten lore so richly spread over the volume of nature, and shadowed forth so variously from the scenes of every-day life and the teachings of individual experience. There is a class of minds, second to none in native acuteness and reflective power, so constituted as to flourish almost exclusively by observation. Too impatient of restraint to endure the long vigils of the scholar, they are yet keenly alive to every idea and truth which is evolved from life. Without a tithe of that spirit of application that binds the German student for years to his familiar tomes, they suffer not a single impression which events or character leave upon their memories to pass unappreciated. Unlearned, in a great measure, in the history of the past, the present is not allowed to pass without eliciting their intelligent comment. Unskilled in the technicalities of learning, they contrive to appropriate, with surprising facility, the wisdom born of the passing moment. No striking trait of character—no remarkable effect in nature—none of the phenomena of social existence, escape them. Like Hogarth, they are constantly enriching themselves with sketches from life; and, as he drew street-wonders upon his thumb-nail, they note and remember, and afterwards elaborate and digest whatever of interest experience affords. Goldsmith was a true specimen of this class. He vindicated, indeed, his claim to the title of scholar, by research and study; but the field most congenial to his taste, was the broad universe of nature and man. It was his love of observation which gave zest to the roving life he began so early to indulge. His boyhood was passed in a constant succession of friendly visits. He was ever migrating from the house of one kinsman or friend to that of another; and on these occasions, as well as when at home, he was silently but faithfully observing. The result is easily traced in his writings. Few authors, indeed, are so highly indebted to personal observation for their materials. It is well known that the original of the Vicar of Wakefield was his own father. Therein has he embodied in a charming manner his early recollections of his parent, and the picture is rendered still more complete in his papers on the “Man in Black.” The inimitable description, too, of the “Village Schoolmaster,” is drawn from the poet's early teacher; and the veteran, who “shouldered his crutch and told how fields were won,” had often shared the hospitality of his father's roof. The leading incident in “She Stoops to Conquer,” was his own adventure; and there is little question, that, in the quaint tastes of Mr. Burchell, he aimed to exhibit many of his own peculiar traits. But it is not alone in the leading characters of his novel, plays and poems, that we discover Goldsmith's observing power. It is equally discernible throughout his essays and desultory papers. Most of his illustrations are borrowed from personal experience, and his opinions are generally founded upon experiment. His talent for fresh and vivid delineation, is ever most prominently displayed when he is describing what he actually witnessed, or drawing from the rich fund of his early impressions or subsequent adventures. No appeal to humor, curiosity, or imagination, was unheeded; and it is the blended pictures he contrived to combine from these cherished associations, that impart so lively an interest to his pages. One moment we find him noting, with philosophic sympathy, the pastimes of a foreign peasantry, and, another, studying the operations of a spider at his garret window,—now busy in nomenclating the peculiarities of the Dutch, and anon alluding to the exhibition of Cherokee Indians. The natural effect of this thirst for experimental knowledge, was to beget a love for foreign travel. Accordingly, we find that Goldsmith, after exhausting the narrow circle which his limited means could compass at home, projected a continential tour, and long cherished the hope of visiting the East. Indeed, we could scarcely have a stronger proof of his enthusiasm, than the long journey he undertook and actually accomplished on foot. The remembrance of his romantic wanderings over Holland, France, Germany, and Italy, imparts a singular interest to his writings. It was indeed worthy of a true poet that, enamored of nature and delighting in the observation of his species, he should thus manfully go forth, with no companion but his flute, and wander over these fair lands hallowed by past associations and existent beauty. A rich and happy era despite its moments of discomfort, to such a spirit, was that year of solitary pilgrimage. Happy and proud must have been the imaginative pedestrian, as he reposed his weary frame in the peasant's cottage “beside the murmuring Loire;” and happier still when he stood amid the green valleys of Switzerland, and looked around upon her snow-capt hills, hailed the old towers of Verona, or entered the gate of Florence—the long-anticipated goals to which his weary footsteps had so patiently tended. If any thing could enhance the pleasure of musing amid these scenes of poetic interest, it must have been the consciousness of having reached them by so gradual and self-denying a progress. There is, in truth, no more characteristic portion of Goldsmith's biography, than that which records this remarkable tour; and there are few more striking instances of the available worth of talent. Unlike the bards of old, he won not his way to shelter and hospitality by appealing to national feeling; for the lands through which he roamed were not his own, and the lay of the last Minstrel had long since died away in oblivion. But he gained the ready kindness of the peasantry by playing the flute, as they danced in the intervals of toil; and won the favor of the learned by successful disputation at the convents and universities—a method of rewarding talent which was extensively practised in Europe at that period. Thus, solely befriended by his wits, the roving poet rambled over the continent, and, notwithstanding the vicissitudes incident to so precarious a mode of seeing the world, to a mind like his, there was ample compensation in the superior opportunities for observation thus afforded. He mingled frankly with the people, and saw things as they were. The scenery which environed him flitted not before his senses, like the shifting scenes of a panorama, but became familiar to his eye under the changing aspects of time and season. Manners and customs he quietly studied, with the advantage of sufficient opportunity to institute just comparisons and draw fair inferences. In short, Goldsmith was no tyro in the philosophy of travel; and, although the course he pursued was dictated by necessity, its superior results are abundantly evidenced throughout his works. We have, indeed, no formal narrative of his journeyings; but what is better, there is scarcely a page thrown off, to supply the pressing wants of the moment, which is not enriched by some pleasing reminiscence or sensible thought, garnered from the recollection and scenes of that long pilgrimage. Nor did he fail to embody the prominent impressions of so interesting an epoch of his chequered life, in a more enduring and beautiful form. The poem of “The Traveller,” originally sketched in Switzerland, was subsequently revised and extended. It was the foundation of Goldsmith's poetical fame. The subject evinces the taste of the author. The unpretending vein of enthusiasm which runs through it, is only equalled by the force and simplicity of the style. The rapid sketches of the several countries it presents, are vigorous and pleasing; and the reflections interspersed, abound with that truly humane spirit, and that deep sympathy with the good, the beautiful, and the true, which distinguishes the poet. This production may be regarded as the author's first deliberate attempt in the career of genius. It went through nine editions during his life, and its success contributed, in a great measure, to encourage and sustain him in future and less genial efforts. The faults which are said to have deformed the character of Goldsmith, belong essentially to the class of foibles rather than absolute and positive errors. Recent biographers agree in the opinion, that his alleged devotion to play has either been grossly exaggerated, or was but a temporary mania; and we should infer from his own allusion to the subject, that he had, with the flexibility of disposition that belonged to him, yielded only so far to its seductions as to learn from experience the supreme folly of the practice. It is at all events certain, that his means were too restricted, and his time, while in London too much occupied, to allow of his enacting the part of a regular and professed gamester; and during the latter and most busy years of his life, we have the testimony of the members of the celebrated club to which he was attached, to the temperance and industry of his habits. Another, and in the eyes of the world, perhaps, greater weakness recorded of him, was a mawkish vanity, sometimes accompanied by jealousy of more successful competitors for the honors of literature. Some anecdotes, illustrative of this unamiable trait, are preserved, which would amuse us, were they associated with less noble endowments or a more uninteresting character. As it is, however, not a few of them challenge credulity, from their utter want of harmony with certain dispositions which he is universally allowed to have possessed. But it is one of the greatest and most common errors in judging of character, to take an isolated and partial, instead of a broad and comprehensive view of the various qualities which go to form the man, and the peculiar circumstances that have influenced their development. Upon a candid retrospect of Goldsmith's life, it appears to us that the display of vanity, which in the view of many are so demeaning, may be easily and satisfactorily explained. Few men possess talent of any kind unconsciously. It seems designed by the Creator, that the very sense of capacity should urge genius to fulfil its mission, and support its early and lonely efforts by the earnest conviction of ultimate success. To beings thus endowed, the neglect and contumely of the world—the want of sympathy —the feeling of misappreciation, is often a keen sorrow felt precisely in proportion to the susceptibility of the individual, and expressed according as he is ingenuous and frank. In the case of Goldsmith, his long and solitary struggle with poverty—his years of obscure toil— his ill-success in every scheme for support, coupled as they were with an intuitive and deep consciousness of mental power and poetic gifts, were calculated to render him painfully alive to the superior consideration bestowed upon less deserving but more presumptuous men, and the unmerited and unjust disregard to his own claims. Weak it undoubtedly was, for him to give vent so childishly to such feelings, but this sprung from the spontaneous honesty of his nature. He felt as thousands have felt under similar circumstances, but, unlike the most of men, “he knew not the art of concealment.” Indeed, this free-spoken and candid disposition was inimical to his success in more than one respect. He was ever a careless talker, unabled to play the great man, and instinctively preferring the spontaneous to the formal, and “thinking aloud” to studied and circumspect speech. The “exquisite sensibility to contempt,” too, which he confesses belonged to him, frequently induced an appearance of conceit, when no undue share existed. The truth is, the legitimate pride 81 of talent, for want of free and natural scope, often exhibited itself in Goldsmith greatly to his disadvantage. The fault was rather in his destiny than himself. He ran away from college with the design of embarking for America, because he was reproved by an unfeeling tutor before a convivial party of his friends; and descended to a personal rencontre with a printer, who impudently delivered Dodsley's refusal that he should undertake an improved edition of Pope. He concealed his name when necessity obliged him to apply for the office of usher; and received visits and letters at a fashionable coffee-house, rather than expose the poorness of his lodgings. He joined the crowd to hear his own ballads sung when a student; and openly expressed his wonder at the stupidity of people, in preferring the tricks of a mountebank to the society of a man like himself. While we smile at, twe cannot wholly deride such foibles, and are constrained o say of Goldsmith as he said of the Village Pastor— “And e'en his failings leaned to virtue's side.” It is not easy to say, whether the improvidence of our poet arose more from that recklessness of the future, characteristic of the Irish temperament, or the singular confidence in destiny which is so common a trait in men of ideal tendencies. It would naturally be supposed, that the stern lesson of severe experience would have eventually corrected this want of foresight. It was but the thoughtlessness of youth which lured him to forget amid the convivialities of a party, the vessel on board which he had taken passage and embarked his effects, on his firs experiment in travelling; but later in life, we find him wandering out on the first evening of his arrival in Edinburgh, without noting the street or number of his lodgings; inviting a party of strangers in a public garden to take tea with him, without a sixpence in his pocket; and obstinately persisting, during his last illness, in taking a favorite medicine, notwithstanding it aggravated his disease. A life of greater vicissitude it would be difficult to find in the annals of literature. Butler and Otaway were, indeed, victims of indigence, and often perhaps, found themselves, like our bard, “in a garret writing for bread, and expecting every moment to be dunned for a milk-score,” but the biography of Goldsmith displays a greater variety of shifts resorted to for subsistence. He was successively an itinerant musician, a half-starved usher, a chemist's apprentice, private tutor, law-student, practising physician, eager disputant, hack-writer, and even, for a week or two, one of a company of strolling players. In the history of George Primrose, he is supposed to have described much of his personal experience prior to the period when he became a professed litterateur. We cannot but admire the independent spirit he maintained through all these struggles with adverse fortune. Notwithstanding his poverty, the attempt to chain his talents to the service of a political faction by mercenary motives was indignantly spurned, and when his good genius proved triumphant, he preferred to incribe its first acknowledged offspring to his brother, than, according to the servile habits of the day, dedicate it to any aristocratic patron, “that thrift might follow fawning.” With all his incapacity for assuming dignity, Goldsmith never seems to have forgotten the self-respect becoming one of nature's nobility. The high degree of excellence attained by Goldsmith in such various and distinct species of literary effort, is worthy of remark. As an essayist, he has contributed some of the most pure and graceful specimens of English prose discoverable in the whole range of literature. His best comedy continues to maintain much of its original popularity, notwithstanding the revolutions which public taste has undergone since it was first produced; and “The Hermit” is still an acknowledged model in ballad-writing. If from his more finished works, we turn to those which were thrown off under the pressing exigencies of his life, it is astonishing what a contrast of subjects employed his pen. During his college days, he was constantly writing ballads on popular events, which he disposed of at five shillings each, and subsequently, after his literary career had fairly commenced, we find him sedulously occupied in preparing prefaces, historical compilations, translations, and reviews for the booksellers; one day throwing off a pamphlet on the Cock-Lane ghost, and the next inditing Biographical Sketches of Beau Nash; at one moment, busy upon a festive song, and at another deep in composing the words for an Oratorio. It is curious, with the intense sentiment and finished pictures of fashionable life with which the fictions of our day abound, fresh in the memory, to open the Vicar of Wakefield. We seem to be reading the memoirs of an earlier era, instead of a different sphere of life. There are no wild and improbable incidents, no startling views, and with the exception of Burchell's incognito, no attempt to excite interest through the attraction of mystery. And yet, few novels have enjoyed such extensive and permanent favor. It is yet the standard work for introducing students on the continent to a knowledge of our language, and although popular taste at present demands quite a different style of entertainment, yet Goldsmith's novel is often reverted to with delight, from the vivid contrast it presents to the reigning school; while the attractive picture it affords of rural life and humble virtue, will ever render it intrinsically dear and valuable. But the “Deserted Village” is, of all Goldsmith's productions, unquestionably the favorite. It carries back the mind to the early season of life, and re-asserts the power of unsophisticated tastes. Hence, while other poems grow stale, this preserves its charm. Dear to the heart and sacred to the imagination, are those sweet delineations of unperverted existence. There is true pathos in that tender lament over the superseded sports and ruined haunts of rustic enjoyment, which never fails to find a response in every feeling breast. It is an elaborate and touching epitaph, written in the cemetery of the world, over what is dear to all humanity. There is a truth in the eloquent defence of agricultural pursuits and natural pastimes, that steals like a well-remembered strain over the heart immersed in the toil and crowds of cities. There is an unborn beauty in the similes of the bird and her “unfledged offspring,” the hare that “pants to the place from whence at first he flew,” and the “tall cliff that lifts its awful form,” 18* which, despite their familiarity, retain their power to delight. And no clear and susceptible mind can ever lose its interest in the unforced, unexaggerated and heart-stirring numbers, which animate with pleasure the pulses of youth, gratify the mature taste of manhood, and fall with a soothing sweetness upon the ear of age. We are not surprised at the exclamation of a young lady who had been accustomed to say, that our poet was the homliest of men, after reading the “Deserted Village”—“I shall never more think Dr. Goldsmith ugly!” This poem passed through five editions in as many months, and from its domestic character became immediately popular throughout England. Its melodious versification is doubtless, in a measure, to be ascribed to its author's musical taste, and the fascinating ease of its flow is the result of long study and careful revision. Nothing is more deceitful than the apparent facility observable in poetry. No poet exhibits more of this characteristic than Ariosto, and yet his manuscripts are filled with erasures and repetitions. Few things appear more negligently graceful than the well-arranged drapery of a statue, yet how many experiments must the artist try before the desired effect is produced. So thoroughly did the author revise the “Deserted Village,” that not a single original line remained. The clearness and warmth of his style is, to my mind, as indicative of Goldsmith's truth, as the candor of his character or the sincerity of his sentiments. It has been said of Pitt's elocution, that it had the effect of impressing one with the idea that the man was greater than the orator. A similar influence it seems to me is produced by the harmonious versification and elegant diction of Goldsmith. It is not, indeed, by an analysis, however critical, of the intellectual distinctions of any author, that we can arrive at a complete view of his genius. It is to the feelings that we must look for that earnestness which gives vigor to mental efforts, and imparts to them their peculiar tone and coloring. And it will generally be found that what is really and permanently attractive in the works of genius, independent of mere diction, is to be traced rather to the heart than the head. We may admire the original conception, the lofty imagery or winning style of a popular author, but what touches us most deeply is the sentiment of which these are the vehicles. The fertile invention of Petrarch, in displaying under such a variety of disguises the same favorite subject, is not so moving as the unalterable devotion which inspires his fancy and quickens his muse. The popularity of Mrs. Hemans is more owing to the delicate and deep enthusiasm than to the elegance of her poetry, and Charles Lamb is not less attractive for his kindly affections than for his quaint humor. Not a little of the peculiar charm of Goldsmith, is attributable to the excellence of his heart. Mere talent would scarcely have sufficed to interpret and display so enchantingly the humble characters and scenes to which his most brilliant efforts were devoted. It was his sincere and ready sympathy with man, his sensibility to suffering in every form, his strong social sentiment and his amiable interest in all around, which brightened to his mind's eye, what to the less susceptible is unheeded and obscure. Naturally endowed with free and keen sensibilities, his own experience of privation prevented them from indurating through age or prosperity. He cherished throughout his life an earnest faith in the better feelings of our nature. He realized the universal beauty and power of Love; and neither the solitary pursuits of literature, the elation of success, nor the blandishments of pleasure or society, ever banished from his bosom the generous and kindly sentiments which adorned his character. He was not the mere creature of attainment, the reserved scholar or abstracted dreamer. Pride of intellect usurped not his heart. Pedantry congealed not the fountains of feeling. He rejoiced in the exercise of all those tender and noble sentiments which are so much more honorable to man than the highest triumphs of mind. And it is these which make us love the man not less than admire the author. Goldsmith's early sympathy with the sufferings of the peasantry, is eloquently expressed in both his poems and frequently in his prose writings. How expressive that lament for the destruction of the `Ale-House'—that it would `No more impart An hour's importance to the poor man's heart.' There is more true benevolence in the feeling which prompted such a thought, than in all the cold and calculating philosophy with which so many expect to elevate the lower classes in these days of ultra-reform. When shall we learn that we must sympathize with those we would improve? At college, we are told, one bitter night Goldsmith encountered a poor woman and her infants shivering at the gate, and having no money to give them bringing out all his bed clothes to keep himself from freezing, cut open his bed and slept within it. When hard at work earning a scanty pittance in his garret, he spent every spare penny in cakes for the children of his poorer neighbors, and when he could do nothing else, taught them dancing, by way of cheering their poverty. Notwithstanding his avowed antipathy to Baretti, he visited and relieved him in prison; and when returning home with the £100 received from his book-seller for the `Deserted Village,' upon being told by an acquaintance he fell in with, that it was a great price for so little a thing, replied, `perhaps it is more than he can afford,' and returning offered to refund a part. To his poor countrymen he was a coustant benefactor, and while he had a shilling was ready to share it with them, so that they familiarly styled him `our doctor.' In Leyden, when on the point of commencing his tour, he stripped himself of all his funds to send a collection of flower-roots to an uncle who was devoted to botany; and on the first occasion that patronage was offered him, declined aid for himself, to bespeak a vacant living for his brother. In truth, his life abounds in anecdotes of a like nature. We read one day of his pawning his watch for Pilkington, another of his bringing home a poor foreigner from Temple gardens to be his amanuensis, and again of his leaving the card-table to relieve a poor woman, whose tones as she chanted some ditty in passing, came to him above the hum of gaiety and indicated to his ear distress.. Though the frequent and underserved subject of literary abuse, he was never known to write severely against any one. His talents were sacredly devoted to the cause of virtue and humanity. No malignant satire ever came from his pen. He loved to dwell upon the beautiful vindications in nature of the paternity of God, and expatiate upon the noblest and most universal attributes of man. `If I were to love you by rule,' he writes to his brother, `I dare say I never could do it sincerely.' There was in his nature, an instinctive aversion to the frigid, ceremonial and meaningless professions which so coldly imitate the language of feeling. Goldsmith saw enough of the world, to disrobe his mind of that scepticism born of custom which `makes dotards of us all.' He did not wander among foreign nations, sit at the cottage fire-side, nor mix in the thoroughfare and gay saloon, in vain Travel liberalized his views and demolished the barriers of local prejudice. He looked around upon his kind with the charitable judgment and interest born of an observing mind and a kindly heart—`with an infinite love, an infinite pity.' He delighted in the delineation of humble life, because he knew it to be the most unperverted. Simple pleasures warmed his fancy because he had learned their preëminent truth. Childhood with its innocent playfulness, intellectual character with its tutored wisdom, and the uncultivated but `bold peasantry,' interested him alike. He could enjoy an hour's friendly chat with his fellow-lodger—the watchmaker in Green Arbor court— not less than a literary discussion with Dr. Johnson. `I must own,' he writes, `I should prefer the title of the ancient philosopher, viz.; a Citizen of the World—to that of an Englishman, a Frenchman, an European, or that of any appellation whatever.' And this title he has nobly earned, by the wide scope of his sympathies and the beautiful pictures of life and nature universally recognized and universally loved, which have spread his name over the world. Pilgrims to the supposed scene of the Deserted Village have long since carried away every vestige of the haw-thron at Lissoy, but the laurels of Goldsmith will never be garnered by the hand of time, or blighted by the frost of neglect, as long as there are minds to appreciate, or hearts to reverence the household lore of English literature. POPE. That system of compensation which is thought by many to balance the apparent inequalities of human destiny, is strikingly illustrated in the case of Alexander Pope. Born in obscurity, he achieved a great reputation, extremely feeble in frame, his mind was singulurly energetic, cut off by deformity from many accomplishments, he gave to his intellectual efforts an unrivalled elegance. Who would have imagined, in contemplating the delicate and misshapen child, that life, by any possibility, could prove any thing to him but a weary experience, whose monotony would be totally unrelieved? Yet glance at the adventures of his poetical career, and in number and variety they will be found equal to those of many a hale knight or wild votary of fashion. At what a tender age he renounced the dictation of masters, assumed the reins of education, and resolutely launched into the profession of a poet! How soon he was engaged in a quarrel with Ambrose Phillips, and what a long satirical contest ensued with Dennis and Cibber! Then followed his intimacy with Lady Montague; their fierce encounters of wit; their friendship, correspondence, and mutual enmity. These and similar scenes of literary animosity, were brightened by friendly intercourse with Gay, Swift, and Bolingbroke: and relieved by long periods of study and composition, visits to noblemen, short journeys, and domestic duties. And thus the weak and diminutive poet managed to rise above the dull existence his organization seemed to ensure, and to find abundance of interest in the excitement of critical warfare and the pursuit of poetical renown. It is a wonderful evidence of the power of mind, that this blighted germ of humanity—who was braced in canvass in order to hold himself upright—put to bed and undressed all his life like a child—often unable to digest the luxuries he could not deny himself, or to keep his eyes open at the honorable tables to which his talents alone gave him access—should yet be the terror of his foes, the envy of his rivals, and the admiration of his friends. He could not manage the sword he so ostentatiously displayed in society, but he wielded a pen whose caustic satire was amply adequate to minister either to his self-defence or revenge. He was `sent into this breathing world but half made up,' and calls his existence `a long disease;' but nature atoned for the unkindness, by endowing him with a judgment marvellous for its refined correctness. He could not enjoy with his neighbors the healthful exercises of the chase; but while they were pursuing a poor hare, with whose death ended the sport, his mind was borne along in a race of rhyme destined to carry his name with honor to posterity. He never laughed 19 heartily; but while weaving his heroics, forgot pain, weariness and the world. In the street, he was an object of pity—at his desk, a king. His head was early deprived of hair, and ached severely almost every day of his life; but his eyes were singularly expressive, and his voice uncommonly melodious. In youth he suffered the decrepitude of age, but at the same time gave evidence of mental precocity and superior sense. He was unequal to a personal rencontre with those who ridiculed his works; but he has bestowed upon them an immortal vengeance in the Dunciad. His unfortunate person shut him out from the triumphs of gallantry, but his talents and reputation long secured him the society and professed friendship of the most brilliant woman of the day; and obtained for him, during most of his life, the faithful care and companionship of Martha Blount. He never knew the buoyancy of spirit which good health induces, but was very familiar with that keen delight that springs from successful mental enterprize. He could not command the consideration attached to noble birth; but, on the strength of his intellectual endowments, he was always privileged to tax the patience of his titled acquaintance for his own convenience and pleasure. Men of letters have been called a race of creatures of a nature between the two sexes. Pope is a remarkable exemplification of the idea. There is a tone of decided manliness in the strong sense which characterizes his productions, and a truly masculine vigor in the patient application with which he opposed physical debility. His disposition on the other hand was morbidly vain. He was weak enough to indulge an ambition for distinguished acquaintance, and a most effeminate caprice swayed his attachments and enmities. Another prominent trait increased his resemblance to the female sex. I allude to a quality which the phrenologists call secretiveness. In its healthy exercise its operation is invaluable. To its influence is ascribed much of that address and tact, in which women are so superior to men. The latter, in ordinary affairs, generally adopt a very direct course. They confide in strength rather than policy. They overlook lesser means in the contemplation of larger ends. This, indeed, is partly owing to their position. Nature always gives additional resources where the relation is that of the pursued rather than the pursuer. Hence, the insight into character, the talent for observation, the skill in tracing motives and anticipating results, which belong to women. It is the abuse, however, of this trait that is obvious in Pope. There seems little question that he was an artful man. He made use of the most unnecessary stratagems to compass a simple favor. His cunning, indeed, was chiefly directed to the acquisition of fame; but nothing subtracts more from our sense of reputation, than a conviction that it is an exclusive end to its possessor. Truly great men never trouble themselves about their fame. They press bravely on in the path of honor and leave their renown to take care of itself. It succeeds as certainly as any law of nature. All elevated spirits have a calm confidence in this truth. Washington felt it in the darkest hour of the revolution, and Shakespeare unconsciously realized it, when he concluded his last play, and went quietly down to finish his days in the country. Pope was a gifted mortal, but he was not of this calibre. He thought a great deal about his reputation. He was not satisfied merely to labor for it, and leave the result. He disputed its possession inch by inch with the critics, and resorted to a thousand petty tricks to secure its enjoyment. The management he displayed in order to publish his letters, is an instance in point. No one can read them without feeling they were written for more eyes than those of his correspondents. There is a labored smartness, a constant exhibition of fine sentiment, which is strained and unnatural. His repeated deprecation of motives of aggrandizement, argues, `a thinking too precisely' on the very subject; and no man, whose chief ambition was to gain a few dear friends, would so habitually proclaim it. These tender and delicate aspirations live in the secret places of the heart. They are breathed in lonely prayers, and uttered chiefly in quiet sighs. Scarcely do they obtain natural expression amid the details of a literary correspondence. True sentiment is modest. It may tinge the conversation and give a feeling tone to the epistle, but it makes not a confessional of every sentry-box, or gallery. The letters of Pope leave upon the mind an impression of affectation. Doubtless they contain much that is sincere in sentiment and candid in opinion, but the general effect lacks the freedom and heartiness of genuine letter-writing. Many of the bard's foibles should be ascribed to his bodily ailments, and the indulgence which he always commanded. Nor should we forget that he proved himself above literary servility— and was, in many instances, a most faithful friend, and always an exemplary son. Pope was the poet of wit and fancy, rather than of enthusiasm and imagination. His invention is often brilliant, but never grand. He rarely excites any sentiment of sublimity, but often one of pleasure. There is little in his poetry that seems the offspring of emotion. He never appears to have written from overpowering impulse. His finest verses have an air of premeditation. We are not swept away by a torrent of individual passion as in Byron, nor melted by a natural sentiment as in Burns, nor exalted by a grandeur of imagery as in Milton. We read Pope with a regular pulse. He often provokes a smile, but never calls forth a tear. His rationality approves itself to our understanding, his fancifulness excites our applause; but the citadel of the soul is uninvaded. We perceive, unawares perhaps, that books have quickened the bard's conception far more than experience. It may be fairly doubted whether Pope possessed, in any great degree, the true poetical sensibility to nature. He thought more of his own domains than becomes a true son of the muse, and had a most unpoetical regard for money, as well as contempt for poverty. His favorite objects of contemplation were Alexander Pope and Twickenham. We cannot wonder that he failed as an editor of Shakspeare. Few objects or scenes of the outward world awoke feelings in his bosom “too deep for tears.” He never claimed such fellowship with the elements as to fancy himself `a portion of the tempest.' It is true he describes well; but where the materials of his pictures are not borrowed, they resemble 19* authentic nomenclatures more than genial sketches. He does not personify nature with the ardor of a votary. He never follows with a lover's perception the phases of a natural phenomenon. The evening wind might have cooled his brow forever, ere he would have been prompted to trace its course with the grateful fondness of Bryant. He might have lived upon the sea coast, and never revelled in its grandeur as did the Peer, and passed a daisy every day, nor felt the meek appeal of its lowly beauty, as did the Ploughman. Even in his letters, Pope depicts scenery with a very cool admiration; and never seems to associate it with any sentiment of moral interest. Where any thing of this appears, it is borrowed. The taste of Pope was evidently artificial to the last degree. He delighted in a grotto decked out with looking-glass and colored stones, as much as Wordsworth in a mountain-path, or Scott in a border antiquity. The Rape of the Lock is considered his most characteristic production, and abounds with brilliant fancy and striking invention. But to what is it devoted? The celebration of a trivial incident in fashionable life. Its inspiration is not of the grove, but the boudoir. It is not bright with the radiance of truth, but with the polish of art. It breathes not the fragrance of wild-flowers, but the fumes of tea. It displays not the simple features of nature, but the paraphernalia of the toilet. We know what the heroine wears and what she does, but must conjecture her peculiar sentiments, and make out of the details of her dress and circumstances, an idea of her character. On her white breast, a sparkling cross she wore Which Jews might kiss and infidels adore. Faultless lines indeed, and they ring most harmoniously; but the poet of feeling would have thrilled us with his description of Belinda's charms, and the poet of imagination would have carried us beneath both the cross and the bosom it adorned, to the young heart of the maiden, and made us `leap on its pants triumphant.' Yet this poem is an extraordinary proof of Pope's fancy. He has invented a long story out of a single and not very interesting fact; and he has told this tale in language the most choice, and rhymes the most correct. The poem is like the fruits and flowers of precious stones set in the exquisite pietra dura tables of Italy,—clear, fanciful, rarely combined, but unwarmed with any glow of nature; and better calculated to awaken admiration than excite sympathy. It is usual to speak of Pope as a poet of the past— one whose peculiarities have given place to a new order of things. But we have ever representatives of his school, both in literature and life. Men who have cultivated their manners to an elegant degree of plausibility, orators who have become masters of an engaging elocution, the grace of which wins us from criticism and reflection, poets who have perfectly learned how to versify, and have more sense than sensibility, more wit than enthusiasm, more fancy than imaginative power;—such are legitimate disciples of Pope. They are useful, attractive, often delightful beings, and effect much in their way; but humanity can be `touched to finer issues' than these conventional though brilliant accomplishments. The truthful aspirant, the mind elevated by great views and aims, the spontaneous and overflowing soul—such spirits as Milton, Burns, Coleridge, and Lamb, awaken a profounder regard. The Essay on Man contains many truisms, a long array of common-place facts, and a few interesting truths. The theory it unfolds, whether the poet's or borrowed, affords little consolation to an ardent and sensitive mind. Pope cherished no very tender or comprehensive views of his race. His observation enabled him only to `catch the manners living as they rise;' and accordingly many of his couplets have passed into proverbs. He inquires `of God above, or man below, What can we reason, but from what we know?' A curious query for a poet whose distinction it is to enjoy the insight of a generous imagination, and whose keen sympathies take him constantly from the narrow limits of the actual, soften the angles of mere logical perception; and `round them with a sleep'—the sweet and dreamy repose of poetical reverie. Pope sings not of Hopes and fears that kindle hope, An undistinguishable throng, And gentle wishes long subdued, Subdued and cherished long. The Epistle to Abelard breathes, indeed, the tremulous faith of love, and paints, not uneffectively, the struggle of that passion in a vestal's heart, but the bard himself refers us to the original letter for the sentiment of the poem. Even the pious invocation of `The Dying Christian to his Soul,' was written with a view to other effusions of a similar nature. The Translations and Imitations of Pope, greatly outweigh his original pieces—a sufficient proof that poetry was to him more of an art than an impulse. The Iliad, however little it may credit his scholarship and fidelity to the original, is truly an extraordinary evidence of his facility in versifying, and of his patient industry. Pope's ideal lay almost wholly in language. He thought that `True expression like the unchanging sun, Clears and improves whate'er it shines upon, It gilds all objects, but it alters none.' To him we are mainly indebted for a new revelation of the capabilities of English heroic verse. He gave the most striking examples of his favorite theory, that `sound should seem an echo to the sense.' He carried out the improvement in diction which Dryden commenced; and while Addison was producing beautiful specimens of reformed prose, Pope gave a polish and point to verse before unknown. When the vast number of his couplets are considered, their fastidious correctness is truly astonishing. How many examples occur to the memory of his correct and musical rhymes, ringing like the clear chimes of a favorite bell through a frosty atmosphere! How often do we forget the poverty of the thought—the familiarity of the image—the triteness of the truths they convey, in the fascinating precision of the verse! It becomes, indeed, wearisome at length from sameness; and to be truly enjoyed must be only resorted to occasionally. The poetical diction of Pope resembles mosaic-work. His words, like the materials of that art, are fitted together with a marvellous nicety. The pictures formed are vivid, exact, and skilful. The consummate tact thus displayed charms the fancy, and suggests a degree of patient and tasteful labor which excites admiration. The best mosaic paintings have a fresh vivacity of hue, and a distinctness of outline, which gratifies the eye; but we yield a higher tribute to the less formal and more spiritual products of the pencil. And such is the distinction between Pope and more imaginative poets. The bright enamel of his rhymes, is like a frozen lake over which we glide, as a skaiter before the wind, surrounded by a glittering landscape of snow. There is a pleasing exhilaration in our course, but little glow of heart or exultation of soul. The poetry of a deeper and less artificial school is like that lake on a summer evening, upon whose tide we float in a pleasure-boat, looking upon the flowering banks, the warm sunset, and the coming forth of the stars. To appreciate justly the perfection to which Pope carried the heroic verse, it is only necessary to consider how few subsequent rhymers have equalled him. He created a standard in this department which is not likely soon to be superseded. Other and less studied metres have since come into vogue, but this still occupies and must retain an important place. It is doubtless the best for an occasional poem intended for oral delivery. Few can manage the Spenserian stanza with effect, and blank verse often wearies an audience. There is a directness in the heroic metre admirably adapted for immediate impression. The thought is converged to bright sallies within its brief limits, and the quickly succeeding rhymes sweeten the sentiment to the ear. Finely chosen words are very effective in the heroic measure, and images have a striking relievo. For bold appeal, and keen satire, this medium is unsurpassed; and it is equally susceptible of touching melody. Witness Byron's description of the dead Medora, and Campbell's protest against scepticism. Rogers and our own Sprague have won their fairest laurels in heroic verse. With this school of poetry, Pope is wholly identified. He most signally exhibited its resources, and to him is justly ascribable the honor of having made it the occasion of refining the English language. He illustrates the power of correctness—the effect of precision. His example has done much to put to shame careless habits of expression. He was a metrical essayist of excellent sense, rare fancy, and bright wit. He is the apostle of legitimate rhyme, and one of the true masters of the art of verse. COWPER. In the gallery of the English poets, we linger with peculiar emotion before the portrait of Cowper. We think of him as a youth, `gigling and making giggle' at his uncle's house in London, and indulging an attachment destined to be sadly disappointed; made wretched by the idea of a peculiar destiny; transferred from a circle of literary roysterers to the gloomy precincts of an Insane Asylum; partially restored, yet shrinking from the responsibilities incident to his age; restless, undecided, desponding even to suicidal wretchedness, and finally abandoning a world for the excitement and struggles of which he was wholly unfit. We follow him into the bosom of a devoted family; witness with admiration the facility he exhibits in deriving amusements from trifling employments—gathering every way-side flower even in the valley of despair, finding no comfort but in `self-deception,' and finding this in `self-discipline.' We behold his singular re-appearance in the world in the capacity of an author,—genius reviving the ties that misfortune had broken. We trace with delight his intellectual career in his charming correspondence with Hayley, Hill, and his cousin, the vividness of his affections in his poem to his mother's picture, the play of his fancy in John Gilpin, his reflective ingenuity in the Task. We recall the closing scene—the failing faculties of his faithful companion,[3] [3]Thy indistinct expressions seem Like language uttered in a dream, Yet me they charm, whate'er their theme, My Mary. his removal from endeared scenes, his sad walks by the sea-shore, his patient, but profound melancholy and peaceful death—with the solemn relief that ensues from the termination of a tragedy. And when we are told that an expression of “holy surprise” settled on the face of the departed, we are tempted to exclaim with honest Kent— O, let him pass! he hates him That would upon the rack of this rude world, Stretch him out longer. At an age when most of his countrymen are confirmed in prosaic habits, William Cowper sat down to versify. No darling theory of the art, no restless thirst for fame, no bardic frenzy prompted his devotion. He sought in poetic labor oblivion of consciousness. He strove to make a Lethe of the waters of Helicon. The gift of a beautiful mind was maried by an unhappy temperament; the chords of a tender heart proved too delicate for the winds of life; and the unfortunate youth became an intellectual hypochondriac. In early manhood, when the 20 first cloud of insanity had dispersed, he took, as it were, monastic vows—and turned aside from the busy metropolis, where his career began, to seek the solace of rural retirement. There, the tasteful care of a conservatory, the exercise of mechanical ingenuity, repose, seclusion and kindness, gradually restored his spirit to calmness; and then the intellect demanded exercise, and this it found in the service of the muse. Few of her votaries afford a more touching instance of suffering than the bard of Olney. In the records of mental disease, his case has a melancholy prominence—not that it is wholly isolated, but because the patient tells his own story, and hallows the memory of his griefs by uniform gentleness of soul and engaging graces of mind. To account for the misery of Cowper, is not so important as to receive and act upon the lesson it conveys. His history is an ever-eloquent appeal in behalf of those, whose delicate organization and sensitive temper expose them to moral anguish. Whether his gloom is ascribable to a state of the brain as physiologists maintain, to the ministry of spirits as is argued by the Swedenborgians, or to the influence of a creed as sectarians declare, is a matter of no comparative moment—since there is no doubt the germs of insanity existed in his very constitution. “I cannot bear much thinking,” he says. “The meshes of the brain are composed of such mere spinner's threads in me, that when a long thought finds its way into them, it buzzes and twangs and bustles about at such a rate as seems to threaten the whole contexture.” Recent discoveries have proved that there is more physiological truth in this remark, than the unhappy poet could ever have suspected. The ideas about which his despair gathered, were probably accidental. His melancholy naturally was referred to certain external causes, but its true origin is to be sought among the mysteries of our nature. The avenues of joy were closed in his heart. He tells us, a sportive thought startled him. “It is as if a harlequin should intrude himself into the gloomy chamber were a corpse is deposited.” In reading his productions, with a sense of his mental condition, what a mingling of human dignity and woe is present to the imagination! A mind evolving the most rational and virtuous conceptions, yet itself the prey of absurd delusions; a heart overflowing with the truest sympathy for a sick hare, yet pained at the idea of the church-honors paid to Handel; a soul gratefully recognizing the benignity of God, in the fresh verdure of the myrtle, and the mutual attachment of doves, and yet incredulous of his care for its own eternal destiny! What a striking incongruity between the thoughtful man, expatiating in graceful numbers upon the laws of Nature and the claims of Religion, and the poor mortal deferring to an ignorant school-master, and “hunted by spiritual hounds in the night-season;” the devout poet celebrating his maker's glory, and the madman trembling at the waxing moon; the affectionate friend patient and devoted, and the timid devotee deprecating the displeasure of a clergyman, who reproved his limited and harmless pleasures! It has been objected to Hamlet, that the sportiveness of the prince mars the effect of his thoughtfulness. It is natural when the mind is haunted and oppressed by any painful idea which it is necessary to conceal, to seek relief, and at the same time increase the deception, by a kind of playfulness. This is exemplified in Cowper's letters. “Such thoughts,” he says, “as pass through my head when I am not writing, make the subject of my letters to you.” One overwhelming thought, however, was gliding like a dark, deep stream beneath the airy structures he thus reared to keep his mind from being swept off by its gloomy current. To this end, he surrendered his pen to the most obvious pleasantry at hand, and dallied with the most casual thoughts of the moment, as Hamlet talks about the “old true-penny in the cellerage,” when the idea of his father's spirit is weighing with awful mysteriousness upon his heart, and amuses himself with joking Old Polonius, when the thought of filial revenge is swaying the very depths of his soul. Cowper speculates on baloons, moralizes on politics, chronicles the details of his home-experience, even to the accidents resulting from the use of a broken table, with the charming air of playfulness that marks the correspondence of a lively girl. How often are these letters the proofs of rare heroism! How often were those flowers of fancy watered by a bleeding heart! By what an effort of will was his mind turned from its forebodings, from the dread of his wretched anniversary, from the one horrible idea that darkened his being, to the very trifles of common-life, the every-day circumstances which he knew so well how to array with fresh interest and agreeable combination! Cowper's story indicates what a world of experience is contained in one solitary life. It lifts the veil from a single human bosom, and displays all the elements of suffering, adventure and peace, which we are apt to think so dependant upon outward circumstances! There is more to be learned from such a record than most histories afford. They relate things en masse, and battles, kings and courts pass before us, like mists along a mountain-range; but in such a life as that of Cowper, we tremble at the capacity of woe involved in the possession of sensibility, and trace with awe and pity the mystery of a “mind diseased.” The anatomy of the soul is, as it were, partially disclosed. Its conflicting elements, its intensity of reflection, its marvellous action fill us with a new and more tender reverence. Nor are the darker shades of this remarkable mental portrait unrelieved. To the reader of his life, Cowper's encounter with young Unwin, under the trees at Huntingdon, is as bright a gleam of destiny as that which visited his heart at Southampton. At the very outset of his acquaintance with this delightful family, he calls them “comfortable people.” This term may seem rather humble compared with such epithets as `brilliant,' `gifted' and `interesting;' but to a refined mind it is full of significance. Would there were more comfortable people in the world! Where there is rare talent in a companion, there is seldom repose. Enthusiasm is apt to make very uncomfortable demands upon our sympathies, and strong-sense is not infrequently accompanied by a dogmatical spirit. Erudite society is generally devoid of freshness, and poetical spirits have the reputation of egotism. However improving such companions may 20* be, to sensitive persons they are seldom comfortable. There is a silent influence in the mere presence of every one, which, whether animal magnetism is true or not, makes itself felt, unless the nerves are insensible; and then there is a decided character in the voice and manner, as well as in the conversation. In comfortable people, all these are harmonized. The whole impression is cheering. We are at ease, and yet gratified; we are soothed and happy. With such companionship was Cowper blessed in the Unwins. No `stricken deer' that ever left the herd of men, required such a solace more. We cannot wonder it proved a balm. The matronly figure of Mrs. Unwin and her `sweet, serene face,' rise before the fancy as pictures of actual memory. We see her knitting beside the fire on a winter day, and Cowper writing opposite; hear her friendly expostulation when he overtasked his mind, and see the smile with which she `restored his fiddle,' when rest made it safe to resume the pen. We follow them with a gaze of affectionate respect as they walk at noon along the gravel-walk, and honor the maternal solicitude that sustains her patient vigils beside the sick-bed of the bard. In imagination we trace her demeanor, as with true female tact she contrived to make the people regard her charge only with reverence. Like a star of peace and promise, beams the memory of this excellent woman upon Cowper's sad history; and Lady Hesketh and `Sister Anne' are the lesser, but still benignant luminaries of that troubled sky. Such glimpses of woman vindicate her true rights more than all the rhetoric of Mary Wolstonecraft. They prove her claim to higher respect than can attach to the trophies of valor or genius. They exhibit her in all the dignity of pure affection, in the discharge of duties and the exercise of sentitiment more exalted than the statesman or soldier can ever boast. They throw around Olney more sacred associations than those which consecrate Vaucluse. Not to a selfish passion, not to ambitious display, not to petty triumphs did these women minister, but to a kindred nature whose self-sustaining energies had been weakened, to a rare spirit bereft of a hope, to a noble heart over-shadowed by despair. It was an office worthy of angels; and even on earth was it thus fulfilled. It is not surprising that Byron denied to Cowper the title of poet. To an impassioned imagination, the tone of his writings cannot but appear subdued even to absolute tameness. There are, however, in his poems flights of fancy, fine comparisons and beautiful descriptive sketches, enough to quicken and impart singular interest to the `still life' so congenial to his muse. He compared her array not inaptly to a quaker-costume. Verse was deliberately adopted by Cowper at a mature age, as a medium of usefulness. His poetry is not therefore the overflowing of youthful feeling, and his good judgment probably warned him to avoid exciting themes, even had his inclination tended in that direction. He became a lay-preacher in numbers. His object was to improve men, not like the bard of Avon by powerfully unfolding their passions, nor like Pope by pure satire; but rather through the quiet teachings of a moralist. He discourses upon hunting, cards, the abuses of the clerical profession and other prevailing follies, like a man who is convinced of the vanity of worldly pleasure and anxious to dispel its illusions from other minds. His strain is generally characterized by good-sense, occasionally enlivened by quiet humor, and frequently exhibits uncommon beauties of style and imagery. It is almost invariably calm. Moral indignation is perhaps the only very warm sentiment with which it glows. It may be questioned whether Cowper's previous experience was the best adapted to educate a reformer. He was a member of a society of wits, called the `Nonsense Club;' and from what we can learn of his associates, it is highly probable that the moderate pursuit of pleasure was a spectacle very unfamiliar to his youth. Hence, perhaps, the severe light in which he viewed society, and the narrow system upon which he judged mankind. `Truths that the theorist could never reach, And observation taught me I would teach.' It is obvious that the poet's observation was remarkably nice and true in certain departments of life, but his early diffidence, few companions and retiring habits must have rendered his view of social characteristics, partial and imperfect. His pictures of spiritual pride and clerical foppery are indeed life-like, but prejudice blinded him to many of the redeeming traits of human nature, and the habit of judging all men by the mere light of his own consciousness prevented him from realizing many of their real wants, and best instincts. His notions on the subject of music, the drama, life in cities, and some other subjects, were one-sided and unphilosophical. He generally unfolds the truth, but it is not always the whole truth. There is, too, a poetic remedy for human error, that his melancholy temper forbade his applying. It is derived from the religion of hope, faith in man—the genial optimism which some later bards have delightfully advocated. To direct men's thoughts to the redeeming aspects of life, to celebrate the sunshine and the flower as types of Eternal goodness and symbols of human joy, to lead forth the sated reveller and make him feel the glory of the stars and the freshness of the breeze, to breathe into the ear of toil the melodies of evening, to charm the votary of fashion by endearing portraitures of humble virtue— these have been found moral specifics, superior to formal expostulation or direct appeal. Cowper doubtless exerted a happy influence upon his contemporaries, and there is and order of minds to which his teachings are peculiarly adapted. He speaks from the contemplative air of rural retirement. He went thither “to muse on the perishing pleasures of life,” to prove that The only amaranthine flower on earth, Is Virtue; the only lasting treasure, Truth. In favor of these principles he addressed his countrymen, and the strain was worthier than any that had long struck their ears. Gradually it found a response, confirmed the right intentions of lowly hearts, and carried conviction to many a thoughtful youth. There was little, however, in this improved poetry, of the “richest music of humanity,” or of the electrifying cheerfulness of true inspiration, and hence, much of it has lost its interest, and the bard of Olney is known chiefly by a few characteristic gems of moral meditation and graphic portraiture. Our obligations then to Cowper as a teacher, are comparatively limited. He was conscious of a good design, and felt himself a sincere advocate. `But nobler yet, and nearer to the skies, To feel one's self in hours serene and still, One of the spirits chosen by Heaven to turn The sunny side of things to human eyes.' The most truly poetic phases of Cowper's verse, are the portions devoted to rural and domestic subjects. Here he was at home and alive to every impression. His disposition was of that retiring kind that shrinks from the world, and is free and at ease only in seclusion. To exhibit himself, he tells us, was `mortal poison,' and his favorite image to represent his own condition, was drawn from the touching instinct which leads a wounded deer to quit the herd and withdraw into lonely shades to die. He desired no nearer view of the world than he could gain from the `busy map of life'—a newspaper; or through the `loop-holes of retreat, to see the stir of the great Babel and not feel the crowd.' I knew a lady whose feelings in this respect strongly resembled those of Cowper, who assured me, she often wished herself provided like a snail, that she might peep out securely from her shell, and withdraw in a moment from a stranger's gaze behind an impenetrable shield. Such beings find their chief happiness in the sacred privacy of home. They leave every public shrine to keep a constant vigil at the domestic altar. There burns without ceasing, the fire of their devotion. They turn from the idols of fashion to worship their household gods. The fire-side, the accustomed window, the familiar garden bound their desires. To happy domestic influences Cowper owed all the peace of mind he enjoyed. He eulogized the blessing with grateful sincerity. O friendly to the best pursuits of man, Friendly to thought, to virtue and to peace, Domestic life in rural leisure passed! “Constant occupation without care,” was his ideal of existence. Even winter was endeared by its home-enjoyments. I crown thee king of intimate delights Fire-side enjoyments, home-born happiness. It was here that the poet struck a responsive chord in the hearts of his countrymen. He sung of the sofa—a memorial of English comfort; of home the castle of English happiness and independence;—of the newspaper—the morning and evening pastime of Englishmen;—of the `hissing urn' and `the cups that cheer, but not inebriate'— the peculiar luxury of his native land;—of the `parlor-twilight,' the `winter evening,' the `noon-day walk'—all subjects consecrated by national associations. Goldsmith and Thompson are the poets of rural life, and Cowper completes the charming triumvirate. The latter's love for the country was absolute. I never framed a wish, or formed a plan, That flattered me with hopes of earthly bliss, But there I laid the scene. His description of the pursuits of horticulture, winter landscapes and rustic pleasures, eloquently betray this peculiar fondness for the scenery and habits of rural life. Many of these pictures are unique, and constitute Cowper's best title to poetic fame. SHELLEY “Was cradled into poetry by wrong, And learned in suffering what he taught in song.” It is now about eighteen years since the waters of the Mediterranean closed over one of the most delicately organized and richly endowed beings of our era. A scion of the English aristocracy, the nobility of his soul threw far into the shade all conventional distinctions; while his views of life and standard of action were infinitely broader and more elevated than the narrow limits of caste. Highly imaginative, susceptible and brave, even in boy-hood he reverenced the honest convictions of his own mind above success or authority. With a deep thirst for knowledge, he united a profound interest in his race. Highly philosophical in his taste, truth was the prize for which he most earnestly contended; heroical in his temper, freedom he regarded as the dearest boon of existence; of a tender and ardent heart, love was the grand hope and consolation of his being, while beauty formed the most genial element of his existence. 21 Of such a nature, when viewed in a broad light, were the elements of Shelley's character. Nor is it difficult to reconcile them with the details of his opinions and the tenor of his life. It is easy to imagine a state of society in which such a being might freely develope, and felicitously realize principles and endowments so full of promise; while, on the other hand, it is only necessary to look around on the world as it is, or back upon its past records, to lose all surprise that this fine specimen of humanity was sadly misunderstood and his immediate influence perverted. The happy agency which as an independent thinker and humane poet might have been prophecied of Shelley, presupposed a degree of consideration and sympathy, not to say delicacy and reverence, on the part of society, a wisdom in the process of education, a scope of youthful experience, an entire integrity of treatment, to be encountered only in the dreams of the Utopian. To have elicited in forms of unadulterated good the characteristics of such a nature, “when his being overflowed,” the world should have been to him, “As a golden chalice to bright wine Which else had sunk into the thirsty dust.”[4] [4] Prometheus Unbound. Instead of this, at the first sparkling of that fountain, the teachings of the world, and the lessons of life, were calculated to dam up its free tide in the formal embankments of custom and power. What wonder, then, that it overleaped such barriers, and wound waywardly aside into solitude, to hear no sound “save its own dashings?” The publication of the posthumous prose† † Essays, Letters from Abroad, Translations and Fragments. By Percy Bysshe Shelley. Edited by Mrs. Shelley: London. 1810. of Shelley, is chiefly interesting from the fact that it perfectly confirms our best impressions of the man. We here trace in his confidential letters, the love and philanthropy to which his muse was devoted. All his literary opinions evidence the same sincerity. His refined admiration of nature, his habits of intense study and moral independence, have not been exaggerated. The noble actions ascribed to him by partial friends, are proved to be the natural results of his native feelings. The peculiar sufferings of body and mind, of experience and imagination, to which his temperament and destiny subjected him, have in no degree been overstated. His generosity and high ideal of intellectual greatness and human excellence, are more than indicated in the unstudied outpourings of his familiar correspondence. Love, according to Shelley, is the sum and essence of goodness. While listening to the organ in the Cathedral of Pisa, he sighed that charity instead of faith was not regarded as the substance of universal religion. Self he considered as the poisonous “burr” which especially deformed modern society; and to overthrow this “dark idolatry,” he embarked on a lonely but most honorable crusade. The impetuosity of youth doubtless gave to the style of his enterprise an aspect startling to some of his well-meaning fellow-creatures. All social reformers must expect to be misinterpreted and reviled. In the case of Shelley, the great cause for regret is that so few should have paid homage to his pure and sincere intentions; that so many should have credited the countless slanders heaped on his name; and that a nature so gifted and sensitive, should have been selected as the object of such wilful persecution. The young poet saw men reposing supinely upon dogmas, and hiding cold hearts behind technical creeds, instead of acting out the sublime idea of human brotherhood. His moral sense was shocked at the injustice of society in heaping contumely upon an erring woman, while it recognizes and honors the author of her disgrace. He saddened at the spectacle so often presented, of artificial union in married life, the enforced constancy of unsympathizing beings, hearts dying out in the long struggle of an uncongenial bond. Above all, his benevolent spirit bled for the slavery of the mass— the superstitious enthralment of the ignorant many. He looked upon the long procession of his fellow-creatures plodding gloomily on to their graves, conscious of social bondage, yet making no effort for freedom, groaning under self-imposed burdens, yet afraid to cast them off, conceiving better things, yet executing nothing. Many have felt and still feel thus. Shelley aspired to embody in action, and to illustrate in life and literature the reform which his whole nature demanded. He dared to lead forth at a public ball the scorned victim of seduction, and appal the hypocritical crowd by an act of true moral courage. As a boy, he gave evidence of his attachment to liberty by overthrowing a system of school tyranny; and this sentiment, in after life, found scope in his Odes to the Revolutionists of Spain and Italy. He fearlessly discussed the subject of marriage, and argued for abolishing an institution which he sincerely believed perverted the very sentiment upon which it is professedly based. “If I have conformed to the usages of the world, on the score of matrimony,” says one of his letters, “it is that disgrace always attaches to the weaker sex.” In relation to this and other of his theories, the language of a fine writer in reference to a kindred spirit is justly applicable to Shelley. “He conceived too nobly for his fellows— he raised the standard of morality above the reach of humanity; and, by directing virtue to the most airy and romantic heights, made her paths dangerous, solitary, and impracticable.” Shelley entertained a perfect disgust for the consideration attached to wealth, and observed, with impatient grief, the shadow property throws over modest worth and unmonied excellence. Upon this sentiment, also, he habitually acted. The maintenance of his opinions cost him, among other sacrifices, a fine estate. So constant and profuse was his liberality towards impoverished men of letters, and the indigent in general, that he was obliged to live with great economy. He subjected himself to serious inconvenience while in Italy, to assist a friend in introducing steam-navigation on the Mediterranean. It was his disposition to glory in and support true merit wherever he found it. He was one of the first to recognize the dawning genius of Mrs. Hemans, to whom he addressed a letter of encouragement when she was a mere girl. He advocated a dietetic reform, from a strong conviction that abstinence from spirituous liquors and animal food, would do much to renovate the human 21* race. Upon this idea his own habits were based. But the most obnoxious of Shelley's avowed opinions, was his non-concurrence in the prevalent system of Religion. To the reflective student of his writings, however, the poet's atheism is very different from what interested critics have made it. School and its associations were inexpressibly trying to his free and sensitive nature; and a series of puzzling questions of a metaphysical character, which he encountered in the course of his recreative reading, planted the seeds of skepticism in his mind, which enforced religious observances and unhappy experience soon fertilized. Queen Mab, the production of a collegian in his teens, is rather an attack upon a creed than Christianity; and was never published with the author's consent. It should be considered as the crude outbreak of juvenile talent eager to make trial of the new weapons furnished by the logic of Eton. Yet it was impertinently dragged into notice to blight the new and rich flowers of his maturer genius, and meanly quoted against Shelley in the chancery suit by which he was deprived of his children. Instead of smiling at its absurdities, or rejecting, with similar reasoning its arguments, the force of authority, the very last to alarm such a spirit, was alone resorted to. What wonder if the ardent boy's doubts of the popular system was increased, his views of social degradation confirmed; that he came to regard custom as the tyrant of the universe, and proposed to abandon a world from whose bosom he had been basely spurned? If an intense attachment to truth, and an habitual spirit of disinterestedness constitute any part of religion, Shelley was eminently religious. For the divine character portrayed in the Gospels, he probably, in his latter years, had a truer reverence than the majority of Christians. If we are to credit one of his most intimate friends, the Beatitudes constituted his delight and embodied his principles of faith. As far as the Deity is worshipped by a profound sensibility to the wonders and beauty of his universe, a tender love of his creatures and a cherished veneration for the highest revelations of humanity, the calumniated poet was singularly devout. “Fools rush in where angels fear to tread,” is true of human conduct not less in its so called religious than its other aspects. We live in an atmosphere of doubt. To attain to clear and unvarying convictions, in regard to the mysteries of our being, is not the lot of all. There are those who cannot choose but wonder at the unbounded confidence of theologians. It is comparatively easy to be a churchgoer, to conform to religious observances, to acquiesce in prevailing opinions; but to how many all this is but a part of the mere machinery of life! There are those who are slow to profess and quick to feel, who can only bow in meekness, and hope with trembling. Shelley's nature was peculiarly reverential, but he entertained certain speculative doubts—and with the ordinary displays of Christianity he could not sympathize. The popular conception of the Divinity did not meet his wants; and so the world attached to him the brand of atheist, and, under this anathema, hunted him down. “The shapings of our Heavens,” says Lamb, “are the modificatiens of our constitu tions.” Shelley's ideal nature modified his religious sentiment. “I loved, I know not what; but this low sphere And all that it contains, contains not thee: Thou whom seen nowhere, I feel everywhere, Dim object of my soul's idolatry.”[5] [5] The Zucca. His Hymn to Intellectual Beauty is instinct with the spirit of pure devotion, directed to the highest conception of his nature. Unthinking, indeed, is he who can for a moment believe that such a being could exist without adoration. Dr. Johnson says that Milton grew old without any visible worship. The opinions of Shelley are no more to be regarded as an index to his heart, than the blind bard's quiet musings as a proof that the fire of devotion did not burn within. Shelley's expulsion from college, for questioning the validity of Christianity, or perhaps more justly, asserting its abuses, was the turning point in his destiny. This event, following immediately upon the disappointment of his first attachment, stirred the very depths of his nature—and in all probability, transformed the future man, from a good English squire, to a politician and reformer. Then came his premature marriage, to which impulsive gratitude was the blind motive, the bitter consequences of his error, his divorce and separation from his children, his new and happy connection founded on true affection and intellectual sympathy, his adventurous exile and sudden death. How long, we are tempted to ask in calmly reviewing his life, will it re quire, in this age of wonders, for the truth to be recognized that opinions are independent of the will, and therefore not, in themselves, legitimate subjects of moral approbation or blame? It has been said that the purposes of men most truly indicate their characters. Where can we find an individual in modern history of more exalted aims than Shelley? While a youth, he was wont to stray from his fellows, and thoughtfully resolve “To be wise And just and free and mild.”[6] [6] Revolt of Islam. When suffering poverty in London, after his banishment, his benevolence found exercise in the hospitals, which he daily visited to minister to the victims of pain and disease. The object of constant malice, he never degenerated into a satirist. “Alas, good friend, what profit can you see In hating such a hateless thing as me? There is no sport in hate, when all the rage Is on one side. Of your antipathy If I am the Narcissus, you are free To pine into a sound with hating me.”† † Sonnet. Though baffled in his plans, and cut off from frequent enjoyment by physicial anguish, love and hope still triumphed over misanthropy and despair. He was adored by his friends, and beloved by the poor. Even Byron curbed his passions at Shelley's wise rebuke, hailed him as his better angel, and transfused something of his elevated tone into the later emanations of his genius. “Fearless he was and scorning all disguise, What he dared do or think, though men might start, He spoke with mild yet unaverted eyes; Liberal he was of soul and frank of heart; And to his dearest friends, who loved him well, Whate'er he knew or felt he would impart.”[7] [7] Prince Athanase. And yet this is the man who was disgraced and banned for his opinions—deemed by a court of his country unworthy to educate his own children—disowned by his kindred, and forced from his native land! What a reflection to a candid mind, that slander long prevented acquaintance and communion between Shelley and Lamb! How disgusting the thought of those vapid faces of the travelling English, who have done more to disenchant Italy than all her beggars, turned in scorn from the poet, as they encountered him on the Pincian or Lung'Arno! With what indignation do we think of that beautiful head being defaced by a blow! Yet we are told, when Shelley was inquiring for letters at a continental post-office, some ruffian, under color of the common prejudice, upon hearing his name, struck him to the earth. As a poet Shelley was strikingly original. He maintained the identity of poetry and philosophy; and the bent of his genius seems to have been to present philosophical speculations, and “beautiful idealisms of moral excellence,” in poetical forms. He was too fond of looking beyond the obvious and tangible to form a merely descriptive poet, and too metaphysical in his taste to be a purely sentimental one. He has neither the intense egotism of Byron, nor the simple fervor of Burns. In general, the scope of his poems is abstract, abounding in wonderful displays of fancy and allegorical invention. Of these qualities, the Revolt of Islam is a striking example. This lack of personality and directness, prevents the poetry of Shelley from impressing the memory like that of Mrs. Hemans or Moore. His images pass before the mind like frost-work at moonlight, strangely beautiful, glittering and rare, but of transient duration, and dream-like interest. Hence, the great body of his poetry can never be popular. Of this he seemed perfectly aware. “Prometheus Unbound,” according to his own statement, was composed with a view to a very limited audience; and the “Cenci,” which was written according to more popular canons of taste, cost him great labor. The other dramas of Shelley are cast in classical moulds, not only as to form but in tone and spirit; and scattered through them are some of the most splendid gems of expression and metaphor to be found in the whole range of English poetry. Although these classical dramas seem to have been most congenial to the poet's taste, there is abundant evidence of his superior capacity in more popular schools of his art. For touching beauty, his “Lines written in Dejection near Naples,” is not surpassed by any similar lyric; and his “Sky-Lark” is perfectly buoyant with the very music it commemorates. “Julian and Maddalo” was written according to Leigh Hunt's theory of poetical diction, and is a graceful specimen of that style. But “The Cenci” is the greatest evidence we have of the poet's power over his own genius. Horrible and difficult of refined treatment as is the subject, with what power and tact is it developed! When I beheld the pensive loveliness of Beatrice's portrait at the Barbarini palace, it seemed as if the painter had exhausted the ideal of her story. Shelley's tragedy should be read with that exquisite painting before the imagination. The poet has surrounded it with an interest surpassing the limner's art. For impressive effect upon the reader's mind, exciting the emotions of “terror and pity” which tragedy aims to produce, how few modern dramas can compare with “The Cenci!” Perhaps “Adonais” is the most characteristic of Shelley's poems. It was written under the excitement of sympathy; and while the style and images are peculiar to the poet, an uncommon degree of natural sentiment vivifies this elegy. In dwelling upon its pathetic numbers, we seem to trace in the fate of Keats, thus poetically described, Shelley's own destiny depicted by the instinct of his genius. “O, weep for Adonais!—The quick Dreams, The passion-winged Ministers of thought, Who were his flocks, whom near the living streams Of his young spirit he fed, and whom he taught The love which was its music, wander not,— Wander no more. `O gentle child, beautiful as thou wert, Why didst thou leave the trodden paths of men Too soon, and with weak hands though mighty heart, Dare the unpastured dragon in his den, Defenceless as thou wert, oh! where was then Wisdom the mirror'd shield, or scorn the spear? Or hadst thou waited the full cycle, when Thy spirit should have fill'd its crescent sphere, The monsters of life's waste had fled from thee like deer. Nor let us weep that our delight is fled Far from these carrion-kites that scream below; He wakes or sleeps with the enduring dead; Thou canst not soar where he is sitting now. Dust to the dust! but the pure spirit shall flow Back to the burning fountain whence it came, A portion of the Eternal. He has outsoar'd the shadow of our night; Envy and calumny, and hate and pain, And that unrest which men miscall delight, Can touch him not and torture not again; From the contagion of the world's slow stain He is secure, and now can never mourn A heart grown cold, a head grown gray in vain; Nor, when the spirit's self has ceased to burn, With sparkless ashes load an unlamented urn. The inheritors of unfulfilled renown, Rose from their thrones built beyond mortal thought Far in the Unapparent. `Thou art become as one of us,' they cry. And he is gather'd to the kings of thought Who waged contention with their time's decay, And of the past are all that cannot pass away. Life, like a dome of many-color'd glass, Stains the white radiance of Eternity, Until Death tramples it to fragments. My spirit's bark is driven Far from the shore, far from the trembling throng Whose sails were never to the tempest given.” 22 The elements of Shelley's genius were rarely mingled. The grand in nature delighted his muse. Volcanoes and glaciers, Alpine summits and rocky caverns filled his fancy. It was his joy to pass the spring-days amid the ruined baths of Caracalla, and to seek the corridors of the Coliseum at moonlight. He loved to watch the growth of thunder-showers, and to chronicle his dreams. German literature, to which he was early attracted, probably originated much of his taste for the wild and wonderful. Plato and the Greek poets, sculpture and solitude, fed his spirit. Such ideas as that of will unconquered by tyranny, the brave endurance of suffering, legends like the “Wandering Jew”—the poetry of evil as depicted in the Book of Job—“Paradise Lost,” the story of “Prometheus,” and the traditions of “The Cenci,” interested him profoundly. He revelled in “the tempestuous loveliness of terror.” The sea was Shelley's idol. Some of his happiest hours were passed in a boat. The easy motion, “Active without toil or stress, Passive without listliness,” probably soothed his excitable temperament; while the expause of wave and sky, the countless phenomena of cloud and billow, and the awful grandeur of storms entranced his soul. Hence his favorite illustrations are drawn from the sea, and many of them are as perfect pearls of poesy as ever the adventurous diver rescued from the deep of imagination. Nor were they obtained without severe struggle and earnest application. Shelley's life was in tense, and although only in his thirtieth year when his beloved element wrapped him in the embrace of death, the snows of premature age already flecked his auburn locks; and, in sensation and experience, he was wont to say, he had far outsped the calendar. Shelley was a true disciple of love. He maintained with rare eloquence the spontaneity and sanctity of the passion, and sought to realize the ideal of his affections with all a poet's earnestness. Alastor typifies the vain search. Time—the great healer of wounded hearts—the mighty vindicator of injured worth—is rapidly dispersing the mists which have hitherto shrouded the fame of Shelley. Sympathy for his sufferings, and a clearer insight into his motives, are fast redeeming his name and influence. Whatever views his countrymen may entertain, there is a kind of living posterity in this young republic, who judge of genius by a calm study of its fruits, wholly uninfluenced by the distant murmur of local prejudice and party rage. To such, the thought of Shelley is hallowed by the aspirations and spirit of love with which his verse overflows; and in their pilgrimage to the old world, they turn aside from the more august ruins of Rome, to muse reverently upon the poet, where “One keen pyramid with wedge sublime, Pavilioning the dust of him who plann'd This refuge for his memory, doth stand Like flame transform'd to marble; and beneath, A field is spread, on which a newer band Have pitched in Heaven's smile their camp of death, Welcoming him we love with scarce extinguish'd breath.”[8] [8] Adonais. Note.—This article having been censured and misunderstood, the following letter was afterwards published in the magazine in which it appeared. “Your letter informing me of the manner in which some of your readers have seen fit to regard my remarks on Shelley, is at hand. I am at a loss to conceive how any candid or discriminating mind can view the article in question as a defence of Shelley's opinions. It was intended rather to place the man himself in a more just point of view, than that which common prejudice assigns him. I only contend that mere opinions—especially those of early youth, do not constitute the only or the best criterion of character. I have spoken in defence rather of Shelley's tendencies and real purposes, than of his theories, and endeavored to vindicate what was truly lovely and noble in his nature. To these gifts and graces the many have long been blinded. We have heard much of Shelley's atheistical philosophy and little of his benevolent heart, much of his boyish infidelity and little of his kind acts and elevated sentiments. That I have attempted to call attention to these characteristics of the poet, I cannot regret; and to me such a course seems perfectly consistent with a rejection of his peculiar views of society and religion. These we know were in a great degree visionary and contrary to well established principles of human nature. Still they were ever undergoing modifications, and his heart often anticipated the noblest teachings of faith. A careful study of the life and writings of Shelley, will narrow the apparent chasm between him and the acknowledged ornaments of our race. It will lead us to trace much that is obnoxious in his views to an aggravated experience of ill, and to discover in the inmost sanctuary of his soul much to venerate and love, much that will sanctify the genius which the careless and bigoted regard as having been wholly desecrated. One of your correspondents says “I do not pretend to be minutely acquainted with the details of his life, having never read his letters recently published.” And yet, confessedly ignorant of the subject, as he is, he yet goes on to repeat and exaggerate the various slanders which have been heaped upon the name of one who I still believe should rank among the most noble characters of modern times. It is not a little surprising that while, in all questions of science, men deem the most careful inquiry requisite to form just conclusions, in those infinitely more subtle and holy inquiries which relate to human character, they do not scruple to yield to the most reckless prejudice. Far otherwise do I look upon such subjects. When an individual has given the most undoubted proof of high and generous character, I reverence human nature too much to credit every scandalous rumor, or acquiesce in the suggestions of malevolent criticism, regarding him. Had your correspondent examined conscientiously the history of Shelley, he would have discovered that he never abandoned his wife, and thus drove her to self-destruction. They were wholly unfit companions. Shelley married her from gratitude, for the kind care she took of him in illness. It was the impulsive act of a generous but thoughtless youth. They separated by mutual consent, and sometime elapsed before she committed suicide. That 22* event is said to have overwhelmed Shelley with grief, not that he felt himself in any manner to blame, but that he had not sufficiently considered his wife's incapacity for self-government, and provided by suitable care for so dreadful an exigency. After this event, Shelley married Miss Godwin, with whom he enjoyed uninterrupted domestic felicity during the short remainder of his life. His conduct accorded perfectly with the views, and, in a great measure, with the practice of Milton. With that prying injustice, which characterizes the English press, in relation to persons holding obnoxious opinions, the facts were misrepresented, and Shelley described as one of the most cruel monsters. So much for his views of Religion and Marriage. “A Friend to Virtue” is shocked at my remark, that “opinions are not in themselves legitimate subjects of moral approbation or censure.” He should have quoted the whole sentence. The reason adduced is, that they are “independent of the will.” This I maintain to be correct. I know not what are the grounds upon which “A Friend of Virtue” estimates his kind. For myself, it is my honest endeavor to look through the web of opinion, and the environment of circumstances, to the heart. Intellectual constitutions differ essentially. They are diversified by more or less imagination and reasoning power, and are greatly influenced by early impressions. Accordingly, it is very rarely that we find two individuals who think precisely alike on any subject. Even in the same person opinions constantly change. Their formation originally depends upon the peculiar traits of mind with which the individual is endowed. His particular moral and mental experience afterward modifies them, so that, except as far as faithful inquiry goes, he is not responsible in the premises. We must then look to the heart, the native disposition, the feelings, if we would really know a man. Thus regarded, Shelley has few equals. Speculatively he may have been an Atheist; in his inmost soul he was a Christian. This may appear paradoxical, but I believe it is more frequently the case than we are aware. An inquiring, argumentative mind, may often fail in attaining settled convictions; while at the same time the moral nature is so true and active, that the heart, as Wordsworth says, may “do God's work and know it not.” Thus I believe it was with Shelley. Veneration was his predominant sentiment. His biographer and intimate friend, Leigh Hunt, says of him, “He was pious towards nature—towards his friends—towards the whole human race—towards the meanest insect of the forest. He did himself an injustice with the public, in using the popular name of the Supreme Being inconsiderately. He identified it solely with the most tyrannical notions of God, made after the worst human fashion; and did not sufficiently reflect that it was often used by a juster devotion to express a sense of the Great Mover of the Universe. An impatience in contradicting worldly and pernicious notions of a supernatural power, led his own aspirations to be unconstrued. As has been justly remarked by a writer eminent for his piety—`the greatest want of religious feeling is not to be found among the greatest infidels, but among those who only think of religion as a matter of course.' The more important the proposition, the more he thought himself bound to investigate it; the greater the demand upon his assent, the less upon their own principles of reasoning he thought himself bound to grant it.” Logical training was the last to which such a nature as Shelley's should have been subjected. Under this discipline at Oxford, he viewed all subjects through the medium of mere reason. Exceedingly fond of argument, in a spirit of adventurous boldness he turned the weappons furnished him by his teachers, against the venerable form of Christianity, and wrote Queen Mab. Be it remembered, however, he never published it. The MSS was thus disposed of without his knowledge, and against his will. Yet at this very time his fellow-student tells us that Shelley studied fifteen hours a-day—lived chiefly upon bread, in order to save enough from his limited income to assist poor scholars—stopped in his long walks to give an orange to a gipsey-boy, or purchase milk for a destitute child—talked constantly of plans for the amelioration of society—was roused to the warmest indignation by every casual instance of oppression—yielded up his whole soul to the admiration of moral excellence— and worshipped truth in every form with a singleness of heart, and an ardor of feeling, as rare as it was inspiring. He was, according to the same and kindred testimony, wholly unaffected in manner, full of genuine modesty, and possessed by an insatiable thirst for knowledge. Although a devoted student, his heart was unchilled by mental application. He at that time delighted in the Platonic doctrine of the preëxistence of the soul, and loved to believe that all knowledge now acquired is but reminiscence. Gentle and affectionate to all, benevolent to a fault, and deeply loved by all who knew him, it was his misfortune to have an early experience of ill, to be thrown rudely upon the world—to be misunderstood and slandered, and especially to indulge the wild speculations of an ardent mind without the slightest worldly prudence. Shelley, phrenologically speaking, had no organ of cautiousness. Hence his virtues and graces availed him not in the world, much as they endeared him to those who enjoyed his intimacy. In these remarks I would not be misunderstood. I do not subscribe to Shelley's opinions. I regret that he thought as he did upon many subjects for his own sake as well as for that of society. The great mass of his poetry is not congenial to my taste. And yet these considerations do not blind me to the rare quality of his genius—to the native independence of his mind —to the noble aspirations after the beautiful and the true, which glowed in his soul. I honor Shelley as that rare character—a sincere man. I venerate his generous sentiments. I recognise in him qualities which I seldom find among the passive recipients of opinion—the tame followers of routine. I know how much easier it is to conform prudently to social institutions; but, as far as my experience goes, they are full of error, and do great injustice to humanity. I respect the man who in sincerity of purpose discusses their claims, even if I cannot coincide in his views. Nor is this all. I cannot lose sight of the fact, that Shelley's nature is but partially revealed to us. We have as it were a few stray gleams of his wayward orb. Had it fully risen above the horizon instead of being prematurely quenched in the sea, perchance its beams would have clearly reflected at last, the holy effulgence of the Star of Bethlehem. Let us pity, if we will, the errors of Shelley's judgment; but let not prejudice blind us to his merits. “His life,” says his wife, “was spent in arduous study, and in acts of kindness and affection. To see him was to love him.” Surely there is a redeeming worth in the memory of one whose bosom was ever ready to support the weary brow of a brother—whose purposes were high and true—whose heart was enamored of beauty, and devoted to his race: —if this fail, The pillared firmament is rottenness, And earth's base built on stubble. BURNS. There are certain sentiments which “give the world assurance of a man.” They are inborn, not acquired. Before them fade away the trophies of scholarship and the badges of authority. They are the most endearing of human attractions. No process of culture, no mere grace of manner, no intellectual endowment, can atone for their absence, or successfully imitate their charms. These sentiments redeem our nature; their indulgence constitutes the better moments of life. Without them we grow mechanical in action, formal in manner, pedantic in mind. With them in freshness and vigor, we are true, spontaneous, morally alive. We reciprocate affection, we luxuriate in the embrace of nature, we breathe an atmosphere of love, and glow in the light of beauty. Frankness, manly independence, deep sensibility and pure enthusiasm are the characteristics of the true man. Against these fashion, trade and the whole train of petty interests wage an unceasing war. In few hearts do they survive; but wherever recognized they carry every unperverted soul back to childhood and up to God. They vindicate human nature with irresistible eloquence, and like the air of mountains and the verdure of valleys, allure us from the thoroughfare of routine and the thorny path of destiny. When combined with genius, they utter an appeal to the world, and their possessor becomes a priest of humanity, whose oracles send forth an echo even from the chambers of death. Such is Robert Burns. How refreshing, to turn from the would-be-prophets of the day, and contemplate the inspired ploughman! No mystic emblems deform his message. We have no hieroglyphics to decipher. We need no philosophic critic at our elbow. It is a brother who speaks to us;—no singular specimen of spiritual pride, but a creature of flesh and blood. We can hear the beatings of his brave heart, not always like a “muffled drum,” but often with the joy of solemn victory. We feel the grasp of his toil-hardened hand. We see the pride on his brow, the tear in his eye, the smile on his lip. We behold not an effigy of buried learning, a tame image from the mould of fashion, but a free, cordial, earnest man;—one with whom we can roam the hills, partake the cup, praise the maiden, or worship the stars. He is a human creature, only overflowing with the characteristics of humanity. To him belong in large measure the passions and the powers of his race. He professes no exemption from the common lot. He pretends not to live on rarer elements. He expects not to be ethereal before death. He conceals not his share of frailty, nor turns aside from penance. He takes `with equal thanks' a sermon or a song. No one prays more devoutly; but the same ardor fires his earthly loves. The voice that “wales a portion with judicious care,” anon is attuned to the convivial song. The same eye that glances with poetic awe upon the hills at twilight, gazes with a less subdued fervor on the winsome features of the Highland lassie. And thus vibrated the poet's heart from earth to heaven,—from the human to the godlike. Rarely and richly were mingled in him the elements of human nature. His crowning distinction is a larger soul; and this he carried into all things,—to the altar of God and the festive board, to the ploughshare's furrow and the letter of friendship, to the martial lyric and the lover's assignation. That such a soul should arise in the midst of poverty is a blessing. So do men learn that all their appliances are as nothing before the creative energy of nature. They may make a Parr; she alone can give birth to a Burns. It is to be rejoiced at that so noble a brother was born in a “clay-built cottage.” Had his eyes first opened in a palace, so great a joy would not have descended upon the lowly and the toil-worn. These can now more warmly boast of a common lineage. Perchance, too, that fine spirit would have been meddled with till quite undone, had it first appeared in the dwelling of a wealthy citizen. Books and teachers, perhaps, would have subdued its elastic freedom,—artificial society perverted its heaven-born fire. Better that its discipline was found in “labor and sorrow,” rather than in social restraint and conformity. Better that it erred through excess of passion, than deliberate hypocrisy. So rich a stream is less marred by overflowing its bounds than by 23 growing shallow. It was nobler to yield to temptation from wayward appetite than through “malignity or design.” More worthy is it that melancholy should take the form of a sad sympathy with nature, than a bitter hatred of man; that the flowers of the heart should be blighted by the heat of its lava-soil, than wither in the deadening air of artificial life. Burns lost not the susceptibility of his conscience, or the sincerity and manliness of his character. In a higher sphere of life, these characteristics would have been infinitely more exposed. The muse of Burns is distinguished by a pensive tenderness. His mind was originally of a reflective cast. His education, destiny and the scenery amid which he lived deepened this trait, and made it prevailing. True sensibility is the fertile source of sadness. A heart constantly alive to the vicissitudes of life and the pathetic appeals of nature, cannot long maintain a lightsome mood. From his profound feeling sprang the beauties of the Scottish bard. He who could so pity a wounded hare and elegize a crushed daisy, whose young bosom favorites were Sterne and Mackenzie, lost not a single sob of the storm, nor failed to mark the gray cloud and the sighing trees. In this intense sympathy with the mournful, exists the germ of true poetical elevation. The very going out into the vastly sad, is sublime. Personal cares are forgotten; and as Byron calls upon us to forget our “petty misery” in view of the mighty ruins of Rome, so the dirges of Nature invite us into a grand funereal hall, where mortal sighs are lost in mightier wailing. This element of pensiveness distinguishes alike the poetry and character of Burns. He tells us of the exalted sensations he experienced on an autumn morning, when listening to the cry of a troop of grey plover or the solitary whistle of the curlew. The elements raged around him as he composed Bannockburn, and he loved to write at night, or during a cloudy day, being most successful in “a gloamin' shot at the muses.” There was a through and pervading honesty about Burns,—that freedom from disguise and simple truth of character, to the preservation of which rustic life is eminently favorable. He was open and frank in social intercourse, and his poems are but the sincere records and outpourings of his native feelings. Just now I've ta'en the fit o' rhyme, My barmie noddle's working prime My fancy yerkit up sublime Wi' hasty summon: Hae ye a leisure-moment's time To hear what's comin? Hence he almost invariably wrote from strong emotion. “My passions,” he says, “raged like so many devils until they found vent in rhyme.” This entire truthfulness is one of the greatest charms of his verse. For the most part song, satire and lyric come warm from his heart. Insincerity and pretension completely disgusted him. Scarcely does he betray the slightest impatience of his fellows, except in exposing and ridiculing these traits. Holy Willie's prayer and a few similar effusions were penned as protests against bigotry and presumption. Burns was too devotional to bear calmly the abuses of region. God knows, I'm not the thing I should be, Nor am I even the thing I could be, But twenty times, I rather would be, An' atheist clean Than under Gospel colors hid be, Just for a screen. But satire was not his element. Rather did he love to give expression to benevolent feeling and generous affection. The native liberality of his nature cast a mantle of charity over the errors of his kind, in language which, for touching simplicity, has never been equalled. Then gently scan your brother man, Still gentler sister woman; Tho' they may gang a kennin wrang; To step aside is human: One point must still be greatly dark, The moving why they do it: And just as lamely can ye mark, How far perhaps they rue it. Wha made the heart, 'tis He alone Decidedly can try us, He knows each chord—its various tone, Each spring, its various bias: Then at the balance let's be mute, We never can adjust it; What's done we partly may compute, But know not what's resisted. Burns had a truly noble soul. He cherished an honest ride. Obligation oppressed him, and with all his rusticity he firmly maintained his dignity in the polished circles of Edinburgh. Like all manly hearts, while he keenly felt the sting of poverty, his whole nature recoiled from dependence. He desired money, not for the distinction and pleasure it brings, but chiefly that he might be free from the world. He recorded the creed of the true man;— To catch dame Fortune's golden smile, Assiduous wait upon her; And gather gear by ev'ry wile That's justified by honor; Not for to hide it in a hedge, Not for a train-attendant; But for the glorious privilege Of being independent. His susceptibility to Nature was quick and impassioned. He hung with rapture over the hare-bell, fox-glove, budding birch and hoary hawthorn. Though chiefly alive to its sterner aspects, every phase of the universe was inexpressibly dear to him. O Nature! a' thy shows an' forms To feeling, pensive hearts hae charms! Whether the simmer kindly warms, Wi' life an' light, Or winter howls, in gusty storms, The lang, dark night! How delightful to see the victim of poverty and care thus yield up his spirit in blest oblivion of his lot. He walked beside the river, climhed the hill and wandered over the moor, with a more exultant step and more bounding heart than ever conqueror knew. In his hours of sweet reverie, all consciousness was lost of outward poverty, in the richness 23* of a gifted spirit. Then he looked upon creation as his heritage. He felt drawn to her by the glowing bond of a kindred spirit. Every wild-flower from which he brushed the dew, every mountain-top to which his eyes were lifted, every star that smiled upon his path, was a token and a pledge of immortality. He partook of their freedom and their beauty; and held fond communion with their silent loveliness. The banks of the Doon became like the bowers of Paradise, and Mossgiel was as a glorious kingdom. Gie me ae spark o' Nature's fire, That's a' the learning I desire; Then tho' I drudge thro' dub an' mire At pleugh or cart, My muse, tho' hamely in attire, May touch the heart. That complete self-abandonment, characteristic of poets, belonged strikingly to Burns. He threw himself, all sensitive and ardent as he was, into the arms of Nature. He surrendered his heart unreservedly to the glow of social pleasure, and sought with equal heartiness the peace of domestic retirement. But why o' death begin a tale? Just now we're living sound and hale, Then top and maintop crowd the sail, Heave care o'er side! And large, before enjoyment's gale, Let's tak the tide. This life has joys for you and I, And joys that riches ne'er could buy, And joys the very best. There's a' the pleasures o' the heart, The lover and the frien; Ye hae your Meg, your dearest part, And I my darling Jean! He sinned, and repented, with the same singleness of purpose, and completeness of devotion. This is illustrated in many of his poems. In his love and grief, in his joy and despair, we find no medium;— By passion driven; And yet the light that led astray Was light from heaven. Perhaps the freest and deepest element of the poetry of Burns, is love. With the first awakening of this passion in his youthful breast, came also the spirit of poetry. “My heart,” says one of his letters, “was complete tinder, and eternally lighted up by some goddess or other.” He was one of those susceptible men to whom love is no fiction or fancy; to whom it is not only a “strong necessity,” but an overpowering influence. To female attractions he was a complete slave. An eye, a tone, a grasp of the hand, exercised over him the sway of destiny. His earliest and most blissful adventures were following in the harvest with a bonnie lassie, or picking nettles out of a fair one's hand. He had no armor of philosophy wherewith to resist the spell of beauty. Genius betrayed rather than absolved him; and his soul found its chief delight and richest inspiration in the luxury of loving. O happy love! where love like this is found. O heart-felt raptures! bliss beyond compare! I've paced much this weary mortal round, And sage experience bids me this declare— “If heaven a draught of heavenly pleasure spare, One cordial in this melancholy vale, 'Tis when a youthful, loving, modest pair, In others' arms breathe out the tendar tale, Beneath the milk-white thorn, that scents the evening gale.” And yet the love of Burns was poetical chiefly in its expression. He loved like a man. His was no mere sentimental passion, but a hearty attachment. He sighed not over the pride of a Laura, nor was satisfied with a smile of distant encouragement. Genuine passion was only vivified and enlarged in his heart by a poetical mind. He arrayed his rustic charmer with few ideal attractions. His vows were paid to A creature not too bright or good For human nature's daily food; For transient sorrows, simple wiles, Praise, blame, love, kisses, tears and smiles. Her positive and tangible graces were enough for him. He sought not to exalt them, but only to exhibit the fervor of his attachment. Even in his love was there this singular honesty. Exaggerated flattery does not mark his amatory poems, but a warm expression of his passionate regard, a sweet song over the joys of affection. Perhaps no poet has better depicted true love, in its most common manifestation. Of the various objects of his regard, the only one who seems to have inspired any purely poetical sentiment was Highland Mary. Their solemn parting on the banks of the Ayr, and her early death, are familiar to every reader of Burns. Her memory seemed consecrated to his imagination, and he has made it immortal by his beautiful lines to Mary in Heaven. Nor was the Scottish bard unaware how deep an inspiration he derived from the gentler sex. He tells us that when he desired to feel the pure spirit of poetry and obey successfully its impulse, he put himself on a regimen of admiring a fine woman. Health to the sex, ilk guid chiel says, Wi' merry dance in winter days, An' we to share in common; The gust o' joy, the balm of woe, The soul o' life, the heaven below, Is rapture-giving woman. And of all the agencies of life there is none superior to this. Written eloquence, the voice of the bard, the music of creation, will often fail to awaken the heart. We cannot always yield ourselves to the hidden spell. But in the soft light of her eye genius basks, till it is warmed into a new and sweeter life. The poet is indeed kindled by communion with the most lovely creation of God, He is subdued by the sweetest of human influences. His wings are plumed beside the fountain of love, and he soars thence to heaven. The poetical temperament is now better and more generally understood than formerly. Physiologists and moral philosophers have labored, not without success, to diffuse correct ideas of its laws and liabilities. Education now averts, in frequent instances, the fatal errors to which beings thus organized are peculiarly exposed. No one has more truly described some features of the poet's fate than the author of Tam O'Shanter and the Cotter's Saturday Night:— Creature, though oft the prey of care and sorrow, When blest to-day, unmindful of to-morrow; A being formed t' amuse his graver friends, Admired and praised—and there the homage ends; A mortal quite unfit for fortune's strife, Yet oft the sport of all the ills of life; Prone to enjoy each pleasure riches give, Yet haply wanting wherewithal to live; Longing to wipe each tear, to heal each groan, Yet frequent all unheeded in his own. The love of excitement, the physical and moral sensibility, the extremes of mood, which belong to this class of men, require a certain discipline on the one hand and indulgence on the other, which is now more readily accorded. Especially do we look with a more just eye upon the frailties of poets. It is not necessary to defend them. They are only the more lamentable from being connected with high powers. But it is a satisfaction to trace their origin to unfavorable circumstances of life and peculiarities of organization. Burns labored under the disadvantage of a narrow and oppressive destiny, opposed to a sensitive and exalted soul. From the depths of obscure poverty he awoke to fame. Strong and adroit as he was at the several vocations of husbandry, he possessed no tact as a manager or financier. With the keenest relish for enjoyment, his means were small, and the claims of his family unceasing. Susceptible to the most refined influences of nature, quick of apprehension, and endowed with a rich fancy, his animal nature was not less strongly developed. His flaming heart lighted not only the muse's torch, but the tempest of passion. He often sought to drown care in excess. He did not faithfully struggle with the allurements which in reality he despised. How deeply he felt the transitory nature of human enjoyment, he has told us in a series of beautiful similes:— But pleasures are like poppies spread, You seize the flow'r, its bloom is shed; Or like the snow falls in the river, A moment white—then melts for ever; Or like the borealis race, That flit ere you can point their place; Or like the rainbow's lovely form Evanishing amid the storm. Tossed on the waves of an incongruous experience, elevated by his gifts, depressed by his condition, the heir of fame, but the child of sorrow—gloomy in view of his actual prospects, elated by his poetic visions,—the life of Burns was no ordinary scene of trial and temptation. While we pity, let us reverence him. Let us glory in such fervent song as he dedicated to love, friendship, patriotism and nature. True bursts of feeling came from the honest bosom of the ploughman. Sad as was his career at Dumfries, anomalous as it seems to picture him as an exciseman, how delightful his image as a noble peasant and ardent bard! What a contradiction between his human existence and his inspired soul! Literature enshrines few more endeared memorials than the poems of Burns. His lyre is wreathed with wild-flowers. Its tones are simple and glowing. Their music is like the cordial breeze of his native hills. It still cheers the banquet, and gives expression to the lover's thought. Its pensive melody has a twilight sweetness; its tender ardor is melting as the sunbeams. Around the cottage and the moor, the scene of humble affection, the rite of lowly piety, it has thrown a hallowed influence, which embalms the memory of Burns, and breathes perpetual masses for his soul. WORDSWORTH. In an intellectual history of our age, the bard of Rydal Mount must occupy a prominent place. His name is so intimately associated with the poetical criticisms of the period, that, even if his productions are hereafter neglected, he cannot wholly escape consideration. The mere facts of his life will preserve his memory. It will not be forgotten that one among the men of acknowledged genius in England, during a period of great political excitement, and when society accorded to literary success the highest honors, should voluntarily remain secluded amid the mountains, the uncompromising advocate of a theory, from time to time sending forth his effusions, as uncolored by the poetic taste of the time, as statues from an isolated quarry. It has been the fortune of Wordsworth, like many original characters, to be almost wholly regarded from the two extremes of prejudice and admiration. The eclectic spirit, which is so appropriate to the criticism of Art, has seldom swayed his commentators. It has scarcely been admitted, that his works may please to a certain extent, and in particular traits, and in 24 other respects prove wholly uncongenial. Whoever recognizes his beauties is held responsible for his system; and those who have stated his defects; have been unfairly ranked with the insensible and unreasonable reviewers who so fiercely assailed him at the outset of his career. There is a medium ground, from which we can survey the subject to more advantage. From this point of observation, it is easy to perceive that there is reason on both sides of the question. It was natural and just that the lovers of poetry, reared in the school of Shakspeare, should be repelled at the outset by a new minstrel, whose prelude was an argument. It was like being detained at the door of a cathedral by a dull cicerone, who, before granting admittance, must needs deliver a long homily on the grandeur of the interior, and explain away its deficiencies. “Let us enter,” we impatiently exclaim: “if the building is truly grand, its sublimity needs no expositor; if it is otherwise, no reasoning will render it impressive.” The idea of adopting for poetical objects “the real language of men, when in a state of vivid sensation,” was indeed, as Coleridge observes, never strictly attempted; but there was something so deliberate, and even cold, in Wordsworth's first appeal, that we cannot wonder it was unattractive. Byron and Burns needed no introduction. The earnestness of their manner secured instant attention. Their principles and purposes were matters of after-thought. Whoever is even superficially acquainted with human nature, must have prophecied a doubtful reception to a bard, who begins by calmly stating his reasons for considering prose and verse identical, his wish to inculcate certain truths which he deemed neglected, and the several considerations which induced him to adopt rhyme for the purpose. Nor is this feeling wholly unworthy of respect, even admitting, with Wordsworth, that mere popularity is no evidence of the genuineness of poetry. Minds of poetical sensibility are accustomed to regard the true poet as so far inspired by his experience, as to write from a spontaneous enthusiasm. They regard verse as his natural element—the most congenial form of expression. They imagine he can scarcely account wholly to himself, far less to others, for his diction and imagery,—any farther than they are the result of emotion too intense and absording to admit of any conscious or reflective process. Even if “poetry takes its origin from emotion recollected in tranquillity,” it must be of that earnest and tender kind, which is only occasionally experienced. Trust, therefore, was not readily accorded a writer who scarcely seemed enamored of his Art, and presented a theory in prose to win the judgment, instead of first taking captive the heart by the music of his lyre. Nor is this the only just cause of Wordsworth's early want of appreciation. He has not only written too much, from pure reflection, but the quantity of his verse is wholly out of proportion to its quality. He has too often written for the mere sake of writing. The mine he opened may be inexhaustible, but to him it is not given to bring to light all its treasures. His characteristics are not universal. His power is not unlimited. On the contrary, his points of peculiar excellence, though rare, are comparatively few. He has endeavored to extend his range beyond its natural bounds. In a word, he has written too much, and too indiscriminately. It is to be feared that habit has made the work of versifying necessary, and he has too often resorted to it merely as an occupation. Poetry is too sacred to be thus mechanically pursued. The true bard seizes only genial periods, and inciting themes. He consecrates only his better moments to “the divinest of arts.” He feels that there is a correspondence between certain subjects and his individual genius, and to these he conscientiously devotes his powers. Wordsworth seems to have acted on a different principle. It is obvious to a discerning reader that his muse is frequently whipped into service. He is too often content to indite a series of common-place thoughts, and memorialize topics which have apparently awakened in his mind only a formal interest. It sometimes seems as if he had taken up the business of a bard, and felt bound to fulfil its functions. His political opinions, his historical reading, almost every event of personal experience, must be chronicled, in the form of a sonnet or blank verse. The language may be chaste, the sentiment unexceptionable, the moral excellent, and yet there may be no poetry, and perhaps the idea has been often better expressed in prose. Even the admirers of Wordsworth are compelled, therefore, to acknowledge, that with all his unrivalled excellencies, he has written too many “Such lays as neither ebb nor flow, Correctly cold, and regularly slow.” Occasional felicities of style do not atone for such frequent desecration of the muse. We could forgive them in a less-gifted minstrel; but with one of Wordsworth's genius it is more difficult to compromise. The number of his indifferent attempts shade the splendor of his real merit. The poems protected by his fame, which are uninspired by his genius, have done much to blind a large class of readers to his intrinsic worth. Another circumstance has contributed to the same result. His redeeming graces often, from excess, become blemishes. In avoiding the tinsel of a meretricious style, he sometimes degenerates into positive homeliness. In rejecting profuse ornament, he often presents his conceptions in so bald a manner as to prove utterly unattractive. His simplicity is not unfrequently childish, his calmness stagnation, his pathos puerility. And these impressions, in some instances, have been allowed to outweigh those which his more genuine qualities inspire. For when we reverse the picture, Wordsworth presents claims to grateful admiration, second to no poet of the age; and no susceptible and observing mind can study his writings without yielding him at least this cordial acknowledgment. It is not easy to estimate the happy influence Wordsworth has exerted upon poetical taste and practice, by the example he has given of a more simple and artless style. Like the sculptors who lead their pupils to the anatomy of the human frame, and the painters who introduced the practice of drawing from the human figure, Wordsworth opposed to the artifificial and declamatory, the clear and natural in diction. He exhibited, as it were, a new source of the elements of expression. He endeavored, and with singular success, 24* to revive a taste for less exciting poetry. He boldly tried the experiment of introducing plain viands, at a banquet garnished with all the art of gastronomy. He offered to substitute crystal water for ruddy wine, and invited those accustomed only to “a sound of revelry by night,” to go forth and breathe the air of mountains, and gaze into the mirror of peaceful lakes. He aimed to persuade men that they could be “moved by gentler excitements” than those of luxury and violence. He essayed to calm their beating hearts, to cool their fevered blood, to lead them gently back to the fountains that “go softly.” He bade them repose their throbbing brows upon the lap of Nature. He quietly advocated the peace of rural solitude, the pleasure of evening walks among the hills, as more salutary than more ostentatious amusements. The lesson was suited to the period. It came forth from the retirement of Nature as quietly as a zephyr; but it was not lost in the hum of the world. Insensibly it mingled with the noisy strife, and subdued it to a sweeter murmur. It fell upon the heart of youth, and its passions grew calmer. It imparted a more harmonious tone to the meditations of the poet. It tempered the aspect of life to many an eager spirit, and gradually weaned the thoughtful from the encroachments of false taste and conventional habits. To a commereial people it portrayed the attractiveness of tranquillity. Before an unhealthy and flashy literature, it set up a standard of truthfulness and simplicity. In an age of mechanical triumph, it celebrated the majestic resources of the universe. To this calm voice from the mountains, none could listen without advantage. What though its tones were sometimes monotonous?—they were hopeful and serene. To listen exclusively, might indeed prove wearisome; but in some placid moments those mild echoes could not but bring good cheer. In the turmoil of cities, they refreshed from contrast; among the green fields, they inclined the mind to recognize blessings to which it is often insensible. There were ministers to the passions, and apostles of learning, sufficient for the exigencies of the times. Such an age could well suffer one preacher of the simple, the natural and the true; one advocate of a wisdom not born of books, of a pleasure not obtainable from society, of a satisfaction underived from outward activity. And such a prophet proved William Wordsworth. Sensibility to Nature is characteristic of poets in general. Wordsworth's feelings in this regard have the character of affection. He does not break out into ardent apostrophes like that of Byron addressed to the Ocean, or Coleridge's Hymn at Chamouni; but his verse breathes a constant and serene devotion to all the charms of natural scenery—from the mountain-range that bounds the horizon, to the daisy beside his path: “If stately passions in me burn, And one chance look to thee I turn, I drink, out of an humbler urn, A lowlier pleasure; The homely sypmathy that heeds The common life our nature breeds, A wisdom, fitted to the needs Of hearts at leisure.” He does not seem so much to resort to the quiet scenes of the country for occasional recreation, as to live and breathe only in their tranquil atmosphere. His interest in the universe has been justly called personal. It is not the passion of a lover in the dawn of his bliss, nor the unexpected delight of a metropolitan, to whose sense rural beauty is arrayed in the charms of novelty; but rather the settled, familiar, and deep attachment of a friend: “Though absent long, These forms of beauty have not been to me As is a landscape to a blind man's eye: But oft in lonely rooms, and 'mid the din Of towns and cities, I have owed to them In hours of weariness sensations sweet, Felt in the blood, and felt along the heart; And passing even into my purer mind With tranquil restoration.” The life, both inward and outward, of Wordsworth, is most intimately associated with lakes and mountains. Amid them he was born, and to them has he ever looked for the necessary aliment of his being. Nor are his feelings on the subject merely passive or negative. He has a reason for the faith that is in him. To the influences of Nature he brings a philosophic imagination. No transient pleasure, no casual agency, does he ascribe to the outward world. In his view, its functions in relation to man are far more penetrating and efficient than has ever been acknowledged. Human education he deems a process for which the Creator has made adequate provision in this “goodly frame” of earth and sea and sky. “He had small need of books; for many a Tale Traditionary, round the mountains hung; And many a legend peopled the dark woods, Nourished Imagination in her growth, And gave the Mind that apprehensive power, By which it is made quick to recognize The moral scope and aptitude of things.” “One impulse from a vernal wood May teach you more of man, Of moral evil and of good, Than all the sages can.” Accordingly, both in details and combination, Nature has been the object of his long and earnest study. To illustrate her unobserved and silent ministry to the heart, has been his favorite pursuit. From his poems might be gleaned a compendium of mountain influences. Even the animal world is viewed in the same light. In the much-ridiculed Peter Bell, Susan, and the White Doe of Rylstone, we have striking instances. To present the affecting points of its relation to mankind has been one of the most daring experiments of his muse: “One lesson, shepherd, let us two divide, Taught both by what she shows and what conceals, Never to blend our pleasure or our pride, With sorrow of the meanest thing that feels.” It is the common and universal in Nature that he loves to celebrate. The rare and startling seldom find a place in his verse. That calm, soothing, habitual language, addressed to the mind by the common air and sky, the ordinary verdure, the field-flower, and the sunset, is the almost invariable theme of his song. And herein have his labors proved chiefly valuable. They have tended to make us more reverent listeners to the daily voices of earth, to make us realize the goodness of our common heritage, and partake, with a more conscious and grateful sensibility, of the beautiful around us. In the same spirit has Wordsworth looked upon human life and history. To lay bare the native elements of character in its simplest form, to assert the essential dignity of life in its most rude and common manifestations, to vindicate the interest which belongs to human beings, simply as such, have been the darling objects of his thoughts. Instead of Corsairs and Laras, peerless ladies and perfect knights, a waggoner, a beggar, a potter, a pedlar, are the character of whose feelings and experience he sings. The operation of industry, bereavement, temptation, remorse and local influences, upon these children of humble toil, have furnished problems which he has delighted to solve. And who shall say that in so doing, he has not been of signal service to his kind? Who shall say that through such portraits a wider and truer sympathy, a more vivid sense of human brotherhood, a more just self-respect, has not been extensively awakened? Have not our eyes been thus opened to the better aspects of ignorance and poverty? Have we not thus been made to feel the true claims of man? Allured by the gentle monitions from Rydal Mount, do we not now look upon our race in a more meek and susceptible mood, and pass the lowliest being beside the highway, with more of that new sentiment of respect and hope which was heralded by the star of Bethlehem? Can we not more sincerely exclaim with the hero of Sartor Resartus: “Poor, wandering, wayward man! Art thou not tried, beaten with many stripes, even as I am? Ever, whether thou wear the royal mantle or the beggar's gaberdine, art thou not so weary, so heavy laden? O! my brother, my brother! why cannot I shelter thee in my bosom, and wipe away all tears from thine eyes?” In accordance with this humane philosophy, Childhood is contemplated by Wordsworth. The spirit of the Saviour's sympathy with this beautiful era of life, seems to possess his muse. Its unconsciousness, its ignorance of death, its trust, hope and peace, its teachings, and promise he has portrayed with rare sympathy. Witness, “We are Seven,” the “Pet Lamb,” and especially the Ode, which is perhaps the finest and most characteristic of Wordsworth's compositions. A reader of his poetry, who imbibes its spirit, can scarcely look upon the young with indifference. The parent must thence derive a new sense of the sacredness of children, and learn to reverence their innocence, to leave unmarred their tender traits, and to yield them more confidently to the influences of Nature. In his true and feeling chronicles of the “heaven” that “lies about us in our infancy,” Wordsworth has uttered a silent but most eloquent reproach upon all the absurdities and sacrilegious abuses of modern education. He has made known the truth, that children have their lessons to convey as well as receive: “O dearest, dearest boy, my heart For better lore would seldom yearn, Could I but teach the hundreth part Of what from thee I learn.” He has made more evident the awful chasm between the repose and hopefulness of happy childhood, and the cynical distrust of worldly age. He thus indirectly but forcibly appeals to men for a more guarded preservation of the early dew of existence, so recklessly lavished upon the desert of ambition: “—Those first affections, Those shadowy recollections, Which, be they what they may, Are yet the fountain-light of all our day; Are yet a master-light of all our seeing; Uphold us, cherish, and have power to make Our noisy years seem moments in the being Of the eternal silence.” He has exemplified that the worst evil of life is rather acquired than inherited, and vindicated the beneficent designs of the Creator, by exhibiting humanity when fresh from his hand. This is a high moral service. Upon many of those who have become familiar with Wordsworth in youth, such impressions must have been permanent and invaluable, greatly influencing their observation of life and nature, and touching “to finer issues” their unpledged sympathies. It is with the eye of a meditative poet that Wordsworth surveys life and nature. And thus inspired, a new elevation is imparted to “ordinary moral sensations,” and it is the sentiment rather than the subject which gives interest to the song. Hence it is absolutely necessary that the reader should sympathize with the feelings of the poet, to enjoy or understand him. He appeals to that contemplative spirit which does not belong to all, and visits even its votaries but occasionally; to “a sadness that has its seat in the depths of reason;” he professes to “follow the fluxes and refluxes of the mind when agitated by the great and simple affections of our nature.” To enter into purposes like these, there must exist a delicate sympathy with human nature, a reflective habit, a mingling of reason and fancy, an imagination active but not impassioned. The frame of mind which he labors to induce, and in which he must be read, is “That sweet mood when pleasure loves to pay Tribute to ease; and, of its joy secure, The heart luxuriates with indifferent things, Wasting its kindliness on stocks and stones, And on the vacant air;” “—that serene and blessed mood, In which the affections gently lead us on, Until the breath of this corporeal frame, And even the motion of our human blood, Almost suspended, we are laid asleep In body, and become a living soul. While, with an eye made quiet by the power Of harmony, and the deep power of joy, We see into the life of things.” This calm and holy musing, this deep and intimate communion with Nature, this spirit of peace, should sometimes visit us. There are periods when passionate poetry wearies, and a lively measure is discordant. There are times when we are calmed and softened, and it is a luxury to pause and forget the promptings of desire and the cares of life; when it is a relief to leave the crowd and wander into solitude, when, faint and disappointed, we seek, like 25 tired children, the neglected bosom of Nature, and in the serenity of her maternal smile, find rest and solace. Such moments redeem existence from its monotony, and refresh the human heart with dew from the urns of Peace. Then it is that the bard of Rydal Mount is like a brother, and we deeply feel that it is good for us to have known him. COLERIDGE. Coleridge appears to have excelled all his contemporaries in personal impressiveness. Men of the highest talent and cultivation have recorded, in the most enthusiastic terms, the intellectual treat his conversation afforded. The fancy is captivated by the mere description of his fluent and emphatic, yet gentle and inspired language. We are haunted with these vivid pictures of the `old man eloquent,' as by those of the sages of antiquity, and the renowned improvisatores of modern times. Hazlitt and Lamb seem never weary of theme. They make us realize, as far as description can, the affectionate temper, the simple bearing, and earnest intelligence of their friend. We feel the might and interest of a living soul, and sigh that it was not our lot to partake directly of its overflowing gifts. Though so invaluable as a friend and companion, unfortunately for posterity, Coleridge loved to talk and read far more than to write. Hence the records of his mind bear no proportion to its endowments and activity. Ill-health early drew him from “life in motion, to life in thought and sensation.” Necessity drove him to literary labor. He was too unambitious, and found too much enjoyment in the spontaneous exercise of his mind, to assume willingly the toils of authorship. His mental tastes were not of a popular cast. In boy-hood he “waxed not pale at philosophic draughts,” and there was in his soul an aspiration after truth—an interest in the deep things of life—a `hungering for eternity', essentially opposed to success as a miscellaneous writer. One of the most irrational complaints against Coleridge, was his dislike of the French. Never was there a more honest prejudice. In literature, he deemed that nation responsible for having introduced the artificial school of poetry, which he detested; in politics, their inhuman atrocities, during the revolution, blighted his dearest theory of man; in life, their frivolity could not but awaken disgust in a mind so serious, and a heart so tender, where faith and love were cherished in the very depths of reflection and sensibility. It is, indeed, easy to discover in his works ample confirmation of the evidence of his friends, but they afford but an unfinished monument to his genius. We must be content with the few memorials he has left of a powerful imagination and a good heart. Of these his poems furnish the most beautiful. They are the sweetest echo of his marvellous spirit;— A song divine, of high and passionate thoughts, To their own music chaunted. The eyes of the ancient Mariner holds us, in its wild spell, as it did the wedding-guest, while we feel the truth that He prayeth best, who loveth best All things both great and small; For the dear God who loveth us, He made and loveth all. The charm of regretful tenderness is upon us with as sweet a mystery, as the beauty of the “lady of a far countrie,” when we read these among other musical lines of Christabel: Alas! they had been friends in youth; But whispering tongues can poison truth, And constancy lives in realms above; And life is thorny; and youth is vain; And to be wroth with one we love, Doth work like madness in the brain. “No man was ever yet a great poet, without being at the same time a profound philosopher.” True as this may be in one sense, we hold it an unfortunate rule for a poetical mind to act upon. It was part of the creed of Coleridge, and his works illustrate its unfavorable influence. His prose generally speaking, is truly satisfactory only when it is poetical. The human mind is so constituted as to desire completeness. The desultory character of Coleridge's prose writings is often wearisome and disturbing. He does not carry us on to a given point by a regular road, but is ever wandering from the end proposed. We are provoked at this waywardness the more, because, ever and anon, we catch glimpses of beautiful localities, and look down most inviting vistas. At these promising fields of thought, and vestibules of truth, we are only permitted to glance, and then are unceremoniously 25* hurried off in the direction that happens to please our guide's vagrant humor. This desultory style essentially mars the interest of nearly all the prose of this distinguished man. Not only the compositions, but the opinions, habits, and experience of Coleridge, partake of the same erratic character. His classical studies at Christ's hospital were interwoven with the reading of a circulating library. He proposed to become a shoemaker while he was studying medicine. He excited the wonder of every casual acquaintance by his schoolboy discourse, while he provoked his masters by starting an argument instead of repeating a rule. He incurred a chronic rheumatism by swimming with his clothes on, and left the sick ward to enlist in a regiment of dragoons. He laid magnificent plans of primitive felicity to be realized on the banks of the Susquehanna, while he wandered penniless in the streets of London. He was at different times a zealous Unitarian, and a high Churchman—a political lecturer— a metaphysical essayist—a preacher—a translator—a traveller—a foreign secretary—a philosopher—an editor— a poet. We cannot wonder that his productions, particularly those that profess to be elaborate, should in a measure, partake of the variableness of his mood. His works, like his life, are fragmentary. He is, too, frequently prolix, labors upon topics of secondary interest and excites only to disappoint expectation. By many sensible readers his metaphysical views are pronounced unintelligible, and by some German scholars declared arrant plagiarisms. These considerations are the more painful from our sense of the superiority of the man. He proposes to awaken thought, to address and call forth the higher faculties,and to vindicate the claims of important truth. Such designs claim respect. We honor the author who conscientiously entertains them. We seat ourselves reverently at the feet of a teacher whose aim is so exalted. We listen with curiosity and hope. Musical are many of the periods, beautiful the images, and here and there comes a single idea of striking value; but for these we are obliged to hear many discursive exord ums, irrelevant episodes and random speculations. We are constantly reminded of Charles Lamb's reply to the poet's inquiry if he had ever heard him preach—`I never knew you do any thing else,' said Elia. It is highly desirable that the prose writings of Coleridge should be thoroughly winnowed. A volume of delightful aphorisms might thus be easily gleaned. Long after we have forgotten the general train of his observations, isolated remarks, full of meaning and truth, linger in our memories. Scattered through his works are many sayings, referring to literature and human nature, which would serve as maxims in philosophy and criticism. Their effect is often lost from the position they occupy, in the midst of abstruse or dry discussions that repel the majority even of truth-seekers. His Biographia is the most attractive of his prose productions. It is not difficult, in a measure at least to explain, or rather account for, these peculiarities. Coleridge himself tells us that in early youth, he indulged a taste for metaphysical speculations to excess. He was fond of quaint and neglected authors. He early imbibed a love of contro ersy, and took refuge in first principles, in the elements of man's nature to sustain his positions. To this ground few of his school-fellows could follow him; and we cannot wonder that he became attached to a field of thought seldom explored, and, from its very vague and mystical character, congenial to him. That he often reflected to good purpose it would be unjust to deny; but that his own consciousness, at times, became morbid, and his speculations, in consequence, disjointed and misty, seems equally obvious. We are not disposed to take it for granted that this irregular development of mental power is the least useful. Perhaps one of Coleridge's evening conversations or single aphorisms has more deeply excited some minds to action, than the regular performances of a dozen inferior men. It is this feeling which probably led him to express, with such earnestness, the wish that the “criterion of a scholar's utility were the number and value of the truths he has circulated and minds he has awakened.” A distinguishing trait of Coleridge's genius was a rare power of comparison. His metaphors are often unique and beautiful. Here also the poet excels the philosopher. It may be questioned if any modern writer whose works are equally limited, has illustrated his ideas with more originality and interest. When encountered amid his grave disquisitions, the similitudes of Coleridge strikingly proclaim the poetical cast of his mind, and lead us to regret that its energies were not more devoted to the imaginative department of literature. At times he was conscious of the same feeling. “Well were it for me perhaps,” he remarks in the Biographia, “had I never relapsed into the same mental disease; if I had continued to pluck the flower and reap the harvest from the cultivated surface, instead of delving in the unwholesome quicksilver mines of metaphysic depths.” That he formed as just an estimate of the superficial nature of political labor, is evident from the following allusion to partizan characters: Fondly these attach A radical causation to a few Poor drudges of chastising Providence, Who borrow all their hues and qualities From our own folly and rank wickedness, Which gave them birth and nursed them. A few examples taken at random, will suffice to show his “dim similitudes woven in moral strains.” “To set our nature at strife with itself for a good purpose, implies the same sort of prudence as a priest of Diana would have manifested, who should have proposed to dig up the celebrated charcoal foundations of the mighty temple of Ephesus, in order to furnish fuel for the burnt-offerings on its altars.” “The reader, who would follow a close reasoner to the summit of the absolute principle of any one important subject, has chosen a chamois-hunter for his guide. He cannot carry us on his shoulders: we must strain our sinews, as he has strained his; and make firm footing on the smooth rock for ourselves, by the blood of toil from our own feet.” “In the case of libel, the degree makes the kind, the circumstances constitute the criminality; and both degree and circumstances, like the ascending shades of color, or the shooting hues of a dove's neck, die away into each other, incapable of definition or outline.” “Would to Heaven that the verdict to be passed on my labors depended on those who least needed them! The water-lily in the midst of waters lifts up its broad leaves and expands its petals, at the first pattering of the shower, and rejoices in the rain with a quicker sympathy than the parched shrub in the sandy desert.” “Human experience, like the stern lights of a ship at sea, illumines only the path which we have passed over.” “I have laid too many eggs in the hot sands of this wilderness, the world, with ostrich carelessness and ostrich oblivion. The greater part, indeed, have been trod under foot, and are forgotten; but yet no small number have crept forth into life, some to furnish feathers for the caps of others, and still more to plume the shafts in the quivers of my enemies.” —On the driving cloud the shining bow, That gracious thing made up of smiles and tears, Mid the wild rack and rain that slant below Stands— As though the spirits of all lovely flowers Inweaving each its wreath and dewy crown, And ere they sunk to earth in vernal showers, Had built a bridge to tempt the angels down. Remorse is as the heart in which it grows: If that be gentle, it drops balmy dews Of true repentance; but if proud and gloomy, It is a poison tree, that, pierced to the inmost, Weeps only tears of poison. The more elaborate poetical compositions of Coleridge display much talent and a rare command of language. His dramatic attempts, however, are decidedly inferior in interest and power to many of his fugitive pieces. Wallenstein, indeed, is allowed to be a master-piece of translation—and, although others have improved upon certain passages, as a whole it is acknowledged to be an unequalled specimen of its kind. But to realize the true elements of the poet's genius, we must have recourse to his minor poems. In these, his genuine sentiments found genial development. They are beautiful emblems of his personal history, and admit us to the secret chambers of his heart. We recognize, as we ponder them, the native fire of his muse, “unmixed with baser matter.” Of the juvenile poems, the Monody on Chatterton strikes us as the most remarkable. It overflows with youthful sympathy, and contains passages of singular power for the effusions of so inexperienced a bard. Take, for instance, the following lines, where an identity of fate is suggested from the consciousness of error and disappointment: Poor Chatterton! he sorrows for thy fate Who would have praised and loved thee, ere too late. Poor Chatterton! farewell! of darkest hues This chaplet cast I on thy unshapen tomb; But dare no longer on the sad theme muse, Lest kindred woes persuade a kindred doom: For oh! big gall-drops, shook from Folly's wing, Have blackened the fair promise of my spring; And the stern Fate transpierced with viewless dart The last pale Hope that shivered at my heart. Few young poets of English origin have written more beautiful amatory poetry than this: O (have I sighed) were mine the wizard's rod, Or mine the power of Proteus, changeful god! A flower-entangled arbor I would seem To shield my love from noontide's sultry beam: Or bloom a myrtle, from whose odorous boughs My love might weave gay garlands for her brows. When twilight stole across the fading vale To fan my love I'd be the evening gale; Mourn in the soft folds of her swelling vest, And flutter my faint pinions on her breast! On seraph wing I'd float a dream by night, To soothe my love with shadows of delight:— Or soar aloft to be the spangled skies, And gaze upon her with a thousand eyes! Nor were religious sentiments unawakened: Fair the vernal mead, Fair the high grove, the sea, the sun, the stars; True impress each of their creating Sire! Yet nor high grove, nor many-colored mead, Nor the green Ocean with his thousand isles, Nor the starred azure, nor the sovran sun, E'er with such majesty of portraiture Imaged the supreme being uncreate, As thou, meek Saviour! at the fearless hour When thy insulted anguish winged the prayer Harped by archangels, when they sing of mercy! Which when the Almighty heard from forth his throne Diviner light filled heaven with ecstacy! Heaven's hymnings paused: and hell her yawning mouth Closed a brief moment. It is delightful to dwell upon these early outpourings of an ardent and gifted soul. They lay bare the real characteristics of Coleridge. Without them our sense of his genius would be far more obscure. When these juvenile poems were written `existence was all a feeling, not yet shaped into a thought.' Here is no mysticism or party-feeling, but the simplicity and fervor of a fresh heart, touched by the beauty of the visible world, by the sufferings of genius, and the appeals of love and religion. The natural and the sincere here predominate over the studied and artificial. Time enlarged the bard's views, increased his stores of knowledge, and matured his mental powers; but his genius, as pictured in his writings, though strengthened and fertilized, thenceforth loses much of its unity. Its emanations are frequently more grand and startling, but less simple and direct. There is more machinery, and often a confusion of appliances. We feel that it is the same mind in an advanced state;—the same noble instrument breathing deeper strains, but with a melody more intricate and sad. In the Sibylline Leaves we have depicted a later stage of the poet's life. Language is now a more effective expedient. It follows the thought with a clearer echo. It is woven with a firmer hand. The subtle intellect is evidently at work in the very rush of emotion. The poet has discovered that he cannot hope “from outward forms to win The passion and the life, whose fountains are within.” A new sentiment, the most solemn that visits the breast of humanity, is aroused by this reflective process—the sentiment of duty. Upon the sunny landscape of youth 26 falls the twilight of thought. A conviction has entered the bosom of the minstrel that he is not free to wander at will to the sound of his own music. His life cannot be a mere revel in the embrace of beauty. He too is a man, born to suffer and to act. He cannot throw off the responsibility of life. He must sustain relations to his fellows. The scenery that delights him assumes a new aspect. It appeals not only to his love of nature, but his sense of patriotism: O divine And beauteous island! thou hast been my sole And most magnificent temple, in the which I walk with awe, and sing my stately songs, Loving the God that made me! More tender ties bind the poet-soul to his native isle— A pledge of more than passing life— Yea, in the very name of wife. Then was I thrilled and melted, and most warm Impressed a father's kiss. Thus gather the many-tinted hues of human destiny around the life of the young bard. To a mind of philosophical cast, the transition is most interesting. It is the distinguishing merit of Coleridge, that in his verse we find these epochs warmly chronicled. Most just is his vindication of himself from the charge of egotism. To what end are beings peculiarly sensitive, and capable of rare expression, sent into the world, if not to make us feel the mysteries of our nature, by faithful delineations, drawn from their own consciousness? It is the lot, not of the individual, but of man in general, to feel the sublimity of the mountain—the loveliness of the flower—the awe of devotion—and the ecstacy of love; and we should bless those who truly set forth the traits and triumphs of our nature—the consolations and anguish of our human life. We are thus assured of the universality of Nature's laws—of the sympathy of all genuine hearts. Something of a new dignity invests the existence, whose common experience is susceptible of such portraiture. In the keen regrets, the vivid enjoyments, the agonizing remorse and the glowing aspirations recorded by the poet, we find the truest reflection of our own souls. There is a nobleness in the lineaments thus displayed, which we can scarcely trace in the bustle and strife of the world. Self-respect is nourished by such poetry, and the hope of immortality rekindled at the inmost shrine of the heart. Of recent poets, Coleridge has chiefly added to such obligations. He has directed our gaze to Mont Blanc as to an everlasting altar of praise; and kindled a perennial flame of devotion amid the snows of its cloudy summit. He has made the icy pillars of the Alps ring with solemn anthems. The pilgrim to the Vale of Chamouni shall not hereafter want a Hymn by which his admiring soul may “wreak itself upon expression.” Rise, O, ever rise, Rise like a cloud of incense, from the earth! Thou kingly spirit throned among the hills, Thou dread ambassador from earth to heaven, Great hierarch! tell thou the silent sky, And tell the stars, and tell yon rising sun, Earth, and her thousand voices praises God. To one other want of the heart has the muse of Coleridge given genuine expression. Fashion, selfishness, and the mercenary spirit of the age, have widely and deeply profaned the very name of Love. To poetry it flies as to an ark of safety. The English bard has set apart and consecrated a spot sacred to its meditation—`midway on the mount,' `beside the ruined tower;' and thither may we repair to cool the eye fevered with the glare of art, by gazing on the fresh verdure of nature, when The moonshine stealing o'er the scene Has blended with the lights of eve, And she is there, our hope, our joy, Our own dear Genevieve. MRS. HEMANS. We have heard much of late regarding the rights and sphere of woman. The topic has become trite. One branch of the discussion, however, is worthy of careful notice—the true theory of cultivated and liberal men on the subject. This has been greatly misunderstood. The idea has been often suggested that man is jealous of his alleged intellectual superiority, while little has been advanced in illustration of his genuine reverence for female character. Because the other sex cannot always find erudition so attractive as grace in woman, and strong mental traits so captivating as a beautiful disposition, it is absurdly argued that mind and learning are only honored in masculine attire. The truth is, men of feeling instinctively recognize something higher than intellect. They feel that a noble and true soul is greater and more delightful than mere reason, however powerful; and they know that to this, extensive knowledge and active logical powers are not essential. It is not the attainments, or the literary talent, that they would have women abjure. They only pray that through and above these may appear 26* the woman. They desire that the harmony of nature may not be disturbed; that the essential foundations of love may not be invaded; that the sensibility, delicacy and quiet enthusiasm of the female heart may continue to awaken in man the tender reverence, which is one of the most elevating of his sentiments. Portia is highly intellectual; but even while arrayed in male costume and enacting the public advocate, the essential and captivating characteristics of her true sex inspire her mien and language. Vittoria Colonna was one of the most gifted spirits of her age—the favorite companion of Michael Angelo, but her life and works were but the eloquent development of exalted womanhood. Madame Roland displayed a strength of character singularly heroic, but her brave dignity was perfectly feminine. Isabella of Spain gave evidence of a mind remarkably comprehensive, and a rare degree of judgment; yet in perusing her history, we are never beguiled from the feeling of her queenly character. There is an essential quality of sex, to be felt rather than described, and it is when this is marred, that a feeling of disappointment is the consequence. It is as if we should find violets growing on a tall tree. The triumphs of mind always command respect, but their style and trophies have diverse complexions in the two sexes. It is only when these distinctions are lost, that they fail to interest. It matters not how erudite or mentally gifted a woman may be, so that she remains in manner and feeling a woman. Such is the idea that man loves to see realized; and in cherishing it, he gives the highest proof of his estimation of woman. He delights to witness the exercise of her noblest prerogative. He is charmed to behold her in the most effective attitude. He appreciates too truly the beauty and power of her nature to wish to see it arrayed in any but a becoming dress. There is such a thing as female science, philosophy and poetry, as there is female physiognomy and taste; not that their absolute qualities differ in the two sexes, but their relative aspect is distinct. Their sphere is as large and high, and infinitely more delicate and deep than that of man, though not so obvious. When they overstep their appropriate domain, much of their mentul influence is lost. Freely and purely exerted, it is at once recognized and loved. Man delights to meet woman in the field of letters as well as in the arena of social life. There also is she his better angel. With exquisite satisfaction he learns at her feet the lessons of mental refinement and moral sensibility. From her teachings he catches a grace and sentiment unwritten by his own sex. Especially in poetry, beams, with starlike beauty, the light of her soul. There he reads the records of a woman's heart. He hears from her own lips how the charms of nature and the mysteries of life have wrought in her bosom. Of such women, Mrs. Hemans is the most cherished of our day. Life is the prime source of literature, and especially of its most effective and universal departments. Poetry should therefore be the offspring of deep experience. Otherwise it is superficial and temporary. What phase of existence is chiefly revealed to woman? Which domain of experience is she best fitted by her nature and position to illustrate? Undoubtedly, the influence and power of the affections. In these her destiny is more completely involved, through these her mind more exclusively acts, than is the case with our sex. Accordingly, her insight is greater, and her interest more extensive in the sphere of the heart. With a quicker sympathy, and a finer perception, will she enter into the history and results of the affections. Accordingly, when the mantle of song falls upon a woman, we cannot but look for new revelations of sentiment. Not that the charms of nature and the majesty of great events may not appropriately attract her muse; but with and around these, if she is a true poetess, we see ever entwined the delicate flowers that flourish in the atmosphere of home, and are reared to full maturity only under the training of woman. Thus the poetic in her character finds free development. She can here speak with authority. It is, indeed, irreverent to dictate to genius, but the themes of female poetry are written in the very structure of the soul. Political economy may find devotees among the gentler sex; and so an approach to the mental hardihood of Lady Macbeth may appear once in the course of an age; whereas, every year we light on the traces of a Juliet, a Cleopatra and an Isabel. The spirit of Mrs. Hemans in all she has written, is essentially feminine. Various as are her subjects, they are stamped with the same image and superscription. She has drawn her prevailing vein of feeling from one source. She has thrown over all her effusions, not so much the drapery of knowledge, or the light of extensive observation, as the warm and shifting hues of the heart. These she had at command. She knew their effects, and felt their mystery. Hence the lavish confidence with which she devoted them to the creations of fancy and the illustration of truth. From the voice of her own consciousness, Mrs. Hemans realized what a capacity of joy and sorrow, of strength and weakness, exists in the human heart. This she made it her study to unfold. The Restoration of the Works of Art to Italy is, as Byron said when it appeared, a very good poem. It is a fine specimen of heroic verse. The subject is treated with judgment and ability, and the spirit which pervades the work is precisely what the occasion demanded. Still we feel that any cultivated and ideal mind might have produced the poem. There are no peculiar traits, no strikingly original conceptions. The same may be said of several of the long pieces. It is in the Songs of the Affections and the Records of Woman that the poetess is preëminently excellent. Here the field is emphatically her own. She ranges it with a free step and a queenly bearing; and everywhere rich flowers spring up in her path, and a glowing atmosphere, like the rosy twilight of her ancestral land, enlivens and illumines her progress. In these mysterious ties of love, there is to her a world of poetry. She not only celebrates their strength and mourns their fragility, but with pensive ardor dwells on their eternal destiny. The birth, the growth, the decline, the sacrifices, the whole morality and spirituality of human love, is recognized and proclaimed by her muse. Profoundly does she feel the richness and the sadness, the glory and the gloom, involved in the affections. She thinks it A fearful thing that love and death may dwell In the same world! And reverently she declares that He that sits above In his calm glory, will forgive the love His creatures bear each other, even if blent With a vain worship; for its close is dim Ever with grief, which leads the wrung soul back to Him. Devotion continually blends with and exalts her views of human sentiment: I know, I know our love Shall yet call gentle angels from above, By its undying fervor. Oh! we have need of patient faith below, To clear away the mysteries of wo! Bereavement has found in Mrs. Hemans a worthy recorder of its deep and touching poetry: But, oh! sweet Friend! we dream not of love's might Till Death has robed with soft and solemn light The image we enshrine!—Before that hour, We have but glimpses of the o'ermastering power Within us laid!—then doth the spirit-flame With sword-like lightning rend its mortal frame; The wings of that which pants to follow fast, Shake their clay bars, as with a prisoned blast,— The sea is in our souls! But thou! whose thoughts have no blest home above, Captive of earth! and canst thou dare to love? To nurse such feelings as delight to rest Within that hallowed shrine a parent's breast? To fix each hope, concentrate every tie, On one frail idol,—destined but to die? Yet mock the faith that points to worlds of light, Where severed souls, made perfect, re-unite? Then tremble! cling to every passing joy Twined with the life a moment may destroy! If there be sorrow in a parting tear. Still let “forever” vibrate on thine ear! If some bright hour on rapture's wind hath flown, Find more than anguish in the thought—'tis gone; Go! to a voice such magic influence give, Thou canst not lose its melody and live; And make an eye the lode-star of thy soul, And let a glance the springs of thought control; Gaze on a mortal form with fond delight, Till the fair vision mingles with thy sight; There seek thy blessings, there repose thy trust, Lean on the willow, idolize the dust! Then when thy treasure best repays thy care, Think on that dread “forever,” and despair. The distinguishing attribute of the poetry of Mrs. Hemans is sentiment. She sings fervently of the King of Arragon, musing upon his slain brother, in the midst of a victorious festival,—of the brave boy perishing at the battle of the Nile, at the post assigned him by his father,— of Del Carpio, upbraiding the treacherous king:— “Into these glassy eyes put light,—be still! keep down thine ire,— Bid these white lips a blessing speak, this earth is not my sire! Give me back him for whom I strove, for whom my blood was shed,— Thou canst not—and a king?—His dust be mountains on thy head!” He loosed the steed; his slack hand fell,—upon the silent face He cast one long, deep, troubled look,—then turned from that sad place. His hope was crushed, his after-fate untold in martial strain,— His banner led the spears no more amidst the hills of Spain. With how true a sympathy does she trace the prison musings of Arabella Stuart, portray the strife of the heart in the Greek bride, and the fidelity of woman in the wife soothing her husband's dying agonies on the wheel! What a pathetic charm breathes in the pleadings of the Adopted Child, and the meeting of Tasso and his Sister. How well she understood the hopelessness of ideal love! O ask not, hope thou not too much Of sympathy below— Few are the hearts whence one same touch Bid the sweet fountains flow: Few and by still conflicting powers Forbidden here to meet— Such ties would make this world of ours Too fair for aught so fleet. Nor is it alone in mere sensibility that the poetess excels. The loftiness and the dignity of her sex has few nobler interpreters. What can be finer in its kind than the Swiss wife's appeal to her husband's patriotism? Her poems abound in the worthiest appeals to woman's faith: Her lot is on you—silent tears to weep, And patient smiles to wear through suffering's hour, And sumless riches from Affection's deep, To pour on broken reeds—a wasted shower! And to make idols, and to find them clay, And to bewail their worship—therefore pray! To depict the parting grief of the Hebrew mother, the repentant tears of Cœur de Lion at his father's bier, the home-associations of the Eastern stranger at the sight of a palm-tree—these, and such as these, were congenial themes to Mrs. Hemans. Joyous as is her welcome to Spring, thoughts of the departed solemnize its beauty. She invokes the Ocean not for its gems and buried gold, but for the true and brave that sleep in its bosom. The bleak arrival of the New England Pilgrims, and the evening devotion of the Italian peasant-girl, are equally consecrated by her muse. Where there is profound love, exalted patriotism, or “a faith touching all things with hues of Heaven,” there she rejoiced to expatiate. Fair as Elysium appeared to her fancy, she celebrates its splendor only to reproach its rejection of the lowly and the loved: For the most loved are they, Of whom Fame speaks not with her clarion voice In regal halls! the shades o'erhung their way, The vale with its deep fountain is their choice, And gentle hearts rejoice Around their steps! till silently they die, As a stream shrinks from summer's burning eye. And the world knows not then, Not then, nor ever, what pure thoughts are fled! Yet these are they that on the souls of men Come back, when night her folding veil hath spread, The long remembered dead! But not with thee might aught save glory dwell— Fade, fade away, thou shore of Asphodel! It was the opinion of Dr. Spurzheim, an accurate and benevolent observer of life, that suffering was essential to the rich development of female character. It is interesting to trace the influence of disappointment and trial in deepening and exalting the poetry of Mrs. Hemans. From the sentimental character of her muse, results the sameness of which some readers complain in perusing her 27 works. This apparent monotony only strikes us when we attempt to read them consecutively. But such is not the manner in which we should treat a poetess who so exclusively addresses our feelings. Like Petrarch's sonnets, her productions delight most when separately enjoyed. Her careful study of poetry as an art, and her truly conscientious care in choosing her language and forming her verse, could not, even if it were desirable, prevent the formation of a certain style. It is obvious, also, that her efforts are unequal. The gems, however, are more profusely scattered, than through the same amount of writing by almost any other modern poet. The department of her muse was a high and sacred one. The path she pursued was one especially heroic, inasmuch as her efforts imply the exertion of great enthusiasm. Such lyrics as we admire in her pages are “fresh from the fount of feeling.” They have stirred the blood of thousands. They have kindled innumerable hearts on both sides of the sea. They have strewn imperishable flowers around the homes and graves of two nations. They lift the thoughts, like an organ's peal, to a “better land,” and quicken the purest sympathies of the soul into a truer life and more poetic beauty. The taste of Mrs. Hemans was singularly elegant. She delighted in the gorgeous and imposing. There is a remarkable fondness for splendid combination, warlike pomp and knightly pageantry betrayed in her writings. Her fancy seems bathed in a Southern atmosphere. We trace her Italian descent in the very flow and imagery of her verse. There is far less of Saxon boldness of design and simplicity of outline, than of the rich coloring and luxuriant grouping of a warmer clime. Akin to this trait was her passion for Art. She used to say that Music was part of her life. In fact, the mind of the poetess was essentially romantic. Her muse was not so easily awakened by the sight of a beautiful object, as by the records of noble adventure. Her interest was chiefly excited by the brave and touching in human experience. Nature attracted her rather from its associations with God and humanity, than on account of its abstract and absolute qualities. This forms the great distinction between her poetry and that of Wordsworth. In the midst of the fine scenery of Wales, her infant faculties unfolded. There began her acquaintance with life and books. We are told of her great facility in acquiring languages, her relish of Shakspeare at the age of six, and her extraordinary memory. It is not difficult to understand how her ardent feelings and rich imagination developed, with peculiar individuality, under such circumstances. Knightly legends, tales of martial enterprize—the poetry of courage and devotion, fascinated her from the first. But when her deeper feelings were called into play, and the latent sensibilities of her nature sprung to conscious action, much of this native romance was transferred to the scenes of real life, and the struggles of the heart. The earlier and most elaberate of her poems are, in a great measure, experimental. It seems as if a casual fancy for the poetic art gradually matured into a devoted love. Mrs. Hemans drew her power less from preception than sympathy. Enthusiasm, rather than graphic talent, is displayed in her verse. We shall look in vain for any remarkable pictures of the outward world. Her great aim was not so much to describe as to move. We discover few scenes drawn by her pen, which strike us as wonderfully true to physical fact. She does not make us see so much as feel. Compared with most great poets, she saw but little of the world. The greater part of her life was passed in retirement. Her knowledge of distant lands was derived from books. Hence she makes little pretension to the poetry of observation. Sketches copied directly from the visible universe are rarely encountered in her works. For such portraiture her mind was not remarkably adapted. There was another process far more congenial to her—the personation of feeling. She loved to sing of inciting events, to contemplate her race in an heroic attitude, to explore the depths of the soul, and amid the shadows of despair and the tumult of passion, point out some element of love or faith unquenched by the storm. Her strength lay in earnestness of soul. Her best verses glow with emotion. When once truly interested in a subject, she cast over it such an air of feeling that our sympathies are won at once. We cannot but catch the same vivid impression; and if we draw from her pages no great number of definite images, we cannot but imbibe what is more valuable—the warmth and the life of pure, lofty and earnest sentiment. CHARACTERISTICS OF LAMB.[9] [9] From the American Quarterly Review. In adding our tribute to the memory of Lamb, we are conscious of personal associations of peculiar and touching interest. We recall the many listless hours he has beguiled; and the very remembrance of happy moments induced by his quiet humor, and pleasing reveries inspired by his quaint descriptions and inimitable pathos, is refreshing to our minds. It is difficult to realise that these feelings have reference to an individual whose countenance we never beheld, and the tones of whose voice never fell upon our ear. Frequent and noted instances there are in the annals of literature, of attempts, on the part of authors, to introduce themselves to the intimate acquaintance of their readers. In portraying their own characters in those of their heroes, in imparting the history of their lives in the form of an epic poem, a popular novel, or through the more direct medium of a professed autobiography, writers have aimed at a striking presentation of themselves. The success of such attempts is, in general, very limited. Like letters of introduction, they indeed, 27* prove passports to the acquaintance, but not necessarily to the friendship of those to whom they are addressed. At best, they ordinarily afford us an insight into the mind of the author, but seldom render us familiar and at home with the man. Charles Lamb, on the contrary,—if our own experience does not deceive us—has brought himself singularly near those who have once heartily entered into the spirit of his lucubrations. We seem to know his history, as if it were that of our brother, or earliest friend. The beautiful fidelity of his first love, the monotony of his long clerkship, and the strange feeling of leisure succeeding its renunciation, the excitement of his “first play,” the zest of his reading, the musings of his daily walk, and the quietude of his fireside, appear like visions of actual memory. His image, now bent over a huge ledger, in a dusky compting-house, and now threading the thoroughfares of London, with an air of abstraction, from which nothing recalls him but the outstretched hand of a little sweep, an inviting row of worm-eaten volumes upon an old book stall, or the gaunt figure of a venerable beggar; and the same form sauntering through the groves about Oxford in the vacation solitude, or seated in a little back study, intent upon an antiquated folio, appear like actual reminiscences rather than pictures of the fancy. The face of his old school-master is as some familiar physiognomy; and we seem to have known Bridget Elia from infancy, and to have loved her, too, notwithstanding her one “ugly habit of reading in company.” Indeed we can compare our associations of Charles Lamb only to those which would naturally attach to an intimate neighbor with whom we had, for years, cultivated habits of delightful intercourse,—stepping over his threshold, to hold sweet commune, whenever weariness was upon our spirits, and we desired cheering and amiable companionship. And when death actually justified the title affixed to his most recent papers—which we had fondly regarded merely as an additional evidence of his unique method of dealing with his fellow beings,—when they really proved the last essays of Elia, we could unaffectedly apply to him the touching language, with which an admired poet has hallowed the memory of a brother bard;— “Green be the turf above thee, Friend of my better days, None knew thee, but to love thee, Nor named thee, but to praise.” And were it only for the peculiar species of fame which Lamb's contributions to the light literature of his country have obtained him,—were it only for the valuable lesson involved in this tributary heritage,—in the method by which it was won,—in the example with which it is associated, there would remain ample cause for congratulation among the real friends of human improvement; there would be sufficient reason to remember, gratefully and long, the gifted and amiable essayist. Instead of the feverish passion for reputation, which renders the existence of the majority of professed literateurs of the present day, a wearing and anxious trial, better becoming the dust and heat of the arena, than the peaceful shades of the academy, a calm and self-reposing spirit pervades and characterises the writings of Lamb. They are obviously the offspring of thoughtful leisure; they are redolent of the otium; and in this consists their peculiar charm. We are disposed to value this characteristic highly, at a time which abounds, as does our age, with a profusion of forced and elaborate writings. It is truly delightful to encounter a work, however limited in design and unpretending in execution, which revives the legitimate idea of literature,—which makes us feel that it is as essentially spontaneous as the process of vegatation, and is only true to its source and its object, when instinct with freshness and freedom. No mind, restlessly urged by a morbid appetite for literary fame, or disciplined to a mechanical development of thought, could have originated the attractive essays we are considering. They indicate quite a different parentage. A lovely spirit of contentment, a steadfast determination towards a generous culture of the soul, breathes through these mental emanations. Imaginative enjoyment,—the boon with which the Creator has permitted man to meliorate the trying circumstances of his lot, is evidently the great recreation of the author, and to this he would introduce his readers. It is interesting to feel, that among the many accomplished men, whom necessity or ambition inclines to the pursuit of literature, there are those who find the time and possess the will to do something like justice to their own minds. Literary biography is little else than a history of martyrdoms. We often rise from the perusal of a great man's life, whose sphere was the field of letters, with diminished faith in the good he successfully pursued. The story of disappointed hopes, ruined health, and a life in no small degree isolated from social pleasure and the incitement which nature affords, can scarcely be relieved of its melancholy aspect by the simple record of literary success. Earnestly as we honor the principle of self-devotion, our sympathy with beings of a strong intellectual and imaginative bias is too great not to awaken, above every other consideration, a desire for the self-possessed and native exhibition of such a heaven-implanted tendency. We cannot but wish that natures thus endowed should be true to themselves. We feel that, in this way, they will eventually prove most useful to the world. And yet one of the rarest results which such men arrive at, is self-satisfaction in the course they pursue—we do not mean as regards the success, but the direction of their labors. Sir James Mackintosh continually lamented, in his diary, the failure of his splendid intentions, consoled himself with the idea of additional enterprises, and finally died without completing his history. Coleridge has left only, in a fragmentary and scattered form, the philosophical system he proposed to develop. Both these remarkable men passed intellectual lives, and evolved, in conversation and fugitive productions, fruits which are worthy of a perennial existence; yet they fell so far short of their aims, they realised so little of what they conceived, that an impression the most painful remains upon the mind that, with due susceptibility, contemplates their career. We find, therefore, an especial gratification in turning from such instances, to a far humbler one indeed, but still to a man of genius, who richly enjoyed his pleasant and sequestered inheritance in the kingdom of letters, and whose comparatively few productions bear indubitable testimony to a mind at ease,—a felicitious expansion of feeling, an imaginative and yet contented life. It is as illustrative of this, that the essays of Elia are mainly valuable. In our view, the form of these writings is a great recommendation. We confess a partiality for the essay. In the literature of our vernacular tongue, it shines conspicuous, and is environed with the most pleasing associations. To the early English essayists is due the honor of the first and most successful endeavors to refine the language and manners of their country. The essays of Dr. Johnson, Goldsmith, Addison, and Steele, while they answered a most important immediate purpose, still serve as instructive disquisitions and excellent illustrations of style. The essay is to prose literature, what the sonnet is to poetry; and as the narrow limits of the latter have enclosed some of the most beautiful poetic imagery, and finished expressions of sentiment within the compass of versified writing, so many of the most chaste specimens of elegant periods, and of animated and embellished prose, exist in the form of essays. The lively pen of Montaigne, the splendid rhetoric of Burke, and the vigorous argument of John Foster, have found equal scope in essay-writing: and among the various species of composition at present in vogue, how few can compare with this in general adaptation. Descriptive sketches and personal traits, speculative suggestions and logical deductions, the force of direct appeal, the various power of illustration, allusion and comment, are equally available to the essayist. His essay may be a lay-sermon or a satire, a criticism or a reverie. “Of the words of men,” says Lord Bacon, “there is nothing more sound and excellent than are letters; for they are more natural than orations, and more advised than sudden conferences.” Essays-combine the qualities here ascribed to the epistolary composition; indeed, they may justly be regarded as letters addressed to the public; embodying—in the delightful style which characterises the private correspondence of cultivated friends—views and details of more general interest. There is more reason to regret the decline of essay-writing, from the fact, that the forms of composition now in vogue, are so inferior to it both in intrinsic excellence and as vehicles of thought. There is, indeed, a class of writers whose object is, professedly and solely, to amuse; or if a higher purpose enters into their design, it does not extend beyond the conveyance of particular historical information. But the majority of prominent authors cherish as to their great end, the inculcation of certain principles of action, theories of life, or views of humanity. We may trace in the views of the most justly admired writers of our own day, a favorite sentiment or theory pervading, more or less, the structure of their several volumes, and constantly presenting itself under various aspects, and in points of startling contrast or thrilling impression. We honor the deliberate and faithful presentation of a theory, on the part of literary men, when they deem it essential to the welfare of their race. Loyalty to such an object bespeaks them worthy of their high vocation; and we doubt if an author can be permanently useful to his fellow beings and true to himself, without such a light to guide, and such an aim to inspire. Dogmatical attachment to mere opinion is doubtless opposed to true progression in thought, but fidelity in the development and vivid portraiture of a sentiment knit into the well-being of man, and coincident with his destiny, is among the most obvious of literary obligations. Something of chivalric interest is attached to “Sidney's Defence of Poesy;” the anxiety for the reform of conventional customs and modes of thinking in society, so constantly evinced in the pages of the Spectator, commands our sympathy and respect; and we think the candid objector to Wordsworth's view of his divine art, cannot but honor the steadiness with which he has adhered to, and unfolded it. Admitting, then, the dignity of such literary ends,—the manner in which they can be most effectually accomplished, must often be a subject of serious consideration. It is generally taken for granted, that the public will give ear to no teacher who cannot adroitly practise the expedient so beautifully illustrated by Tasso, in the simile of the chalice of medicine with a honeyed rim. True as it is, that in an age surfeited with books of every description, there exists a kind of necessity for setting decoys afloat upon the stream of literature—is not the faith in literary lures altogether too perfect? Does the mental offspring we have cherished, obtain the kind of attention we desire, when ushered into the world arrayed in the garb of fiction? The experiment, we acknowledge, succeeds in one respect. The inviting dress will attract the eyes of the multitude; but how few will penetrate to the theory, appreciate the moral, or enter into the thoughts to which the fanciful costume is only the drapery and frame-work? The truth is, the very object of writers who would present a philosophical problem through the medium of a novel, is barely recognized. Corinna is still regarded as a romance sui generis. Several efforts of the kind, on the part of living British writers of acknowledged power, seem to have utterly failed of their purpose, as far as the mass of readers, whom they were especially intended to affect, are concerned. The plan in such instances, is strictly psychological. Public attention, however, is at once riveted on the plot and details; and some strong delineation of human passion, some trivial error in the external sketching, some over intense or too minute personation of feeling, suffices, we do not say how justly, to condemn the work in the view—even of the discriminating. Now we are confident, that should the writers in question choose the essay as a vehicle of communication, their success in many cases would be more complete. Their ideas of life, of a foreign land, of modern society, or of human destiny, presented in this shape, with the graces of style, the attraction of anecdote, and the vivacity of wit and feeling, could not but find their way to the only class of readers who will ever estimate such labors; those who read to excite thought, as well as beguile time; to gratify an intellectual taste, as well as amuse an ardent fancy. The novel, too, is in its very nature ephemeral. The very origin of the word associates such productions with the gazettes and magazines—the temporary caskets of literature. And with the exception of Scott's, and a few admirable historical romances, novels seem among the most 28 frail of literary tabernacles. Now, in reference to the class of authors to whom we have alluded, those who have a definite and important point in view, who are enthusiastic in behalf of a particular moral or mental enterprise, the evanescent nature of the popular vehicle is an important consideration. We would behold a more permanent personification of their systems, a more lasting testimony of their interest in humanity. And such we consider the essay. When presented, condensed, and embellished in this more primitive form, a fair opportunity will be afforded for the candid examination of their sentiments; and we are persuaded that these very ideas, thus arranged and disseminated, will possess a weight and an interest which they can never exhibit when displayed in the elaborate and desultory manner incident to popular fiction. An interesting illustration of these remarks may be found in the circumstance that many intelligent men, who are quite inimical to Bulwer, as a novelist, have become interested in his mind by the perusal of “England and the English,” and “The Student”—works which are essentially specimens of essay writing. The dramatic form of composition has recently been adopted in England, to subserve the theoretical purposes of authors. This, it must be confessed, is a decided improvement upon the more fashionable method; and the favor with which it has been received, is sufficiently indicative of the readiness of the public to become familiar with nobler models of literature. We are under no slight obligations to Charles Lamb, for so pleasantly reviving a favorite form of English composition. We welcome Elia as the Spectator-redivivus It is interesting to be amused and instructed after the manner of that delectable coterie of lay-preachers, humorists, and critics, of which Sir Roger de Coverly was so distinguished a member. It is peculiarly agreeeble to be talked to in a book, as if the writer addressed himself to us particularly. Next to a long epistle from an entertaining friend, we love, of all things in the world, a charming essay;—a concise array of ideas—an unique sketch, which furnishes subjects for an hour's reflection, or gives rise to a succession of soothing day-dreams. Few books are more truly useful than such as can be relished in the brief intervals of active or social life, which permit immediate appreciation, and, taken up when and where they may be, present topics upon which the attention can at once fix itself, and trains of speculation into which the mind easily glides. To such a work we suppose a celebrated writer alludes, in the phrase “parlor window-seat book.” Collections of essays are essentially of this order. We would not be understood, however, as intimating that this kind of literature is especially unworthy of studious regard; Bacon's Essays alone would refute such an idea; but from its conciseness and singleness of aim, the essay may be enjoyed in a brief period, and when the mind is unable to attach itself to more elaborate reading. A volume of essays subserves the purpose of a set of cabinet pictures, or a port-folio of miniature drawings; they are the multum in parvo of literature; and, perused, as they generally are, in moments of respite from ordinary occupation, turned to on the spur of mental appetite, they not unfrequently prove more efficient than belles-lettres allurements of greater pretension. It is seldom that any desirable additions are made in this important department of writing; and among the contributions of the present age, the essays of Elia will deservedly hold an elevated rank. Much of the interest awakened by these papers, has been ascribed to the peculiar phraseology in which they are couched. Doubtless, this characteristic has had its influence; but we think an undue importance has been given it, and we feel that the true zest of Elia's manner is as spontaneous as his ideas, and the shape in which they naturally present themselves. If we analyse his mode of expression, we shall find its charm consists not a little in the expert variation rather than in a constant maintenance of style. He understood the proper time and place to introduce an illustration; he knew when to serve up one of his unequalled strokes of humor, and when to change the speculative for the descriptive mood. He had a happy way of blending anecdote and portraiture; he makes us see the place, person, or thing, upon which he is dwelling; and, at the moment our interest is excited, presents an incident, and then, while we are all attention, imparts a moral, or lures us into a theorising vein. He personifies his subjcet, too, at the appropriate moment; nor idealises, after the manner of many essayists, before the reader sympathises at all with the real picture. Lamb's diction breathes the spirit of his favorite school. He need not have told us of his partiality for the old English writers. Every page of Elia bears witness to his frequent and fond communion with the rich, ancient models of British literature. Yet the coincidence is, in no degree, that which obtains between an original and a copyist. The tinge which Lamb's language has caught from intimacy with the quaint folios he so sincerely admired, is a reflected hue, like that which suffuses the arch of clouds far above the setting sun; denoting only the delightful influence radiated upon the mind which loves to dwell devotedly upon what is disappearing, and turns with a kind of religious interest from the new-born luminaries which the multitude worship, to hover devotedly round the shrine of the past. If any modern lover of letters deserved a heritage in the sacred garden of old English literature, that one was Charles Lamb. Not only did he possess the right which faithful husbandry yields, but his disposition and taste rendered him a companion meet for the noble spirits that have immortalized the age of Elizabeth. In truth, he may be said to have been on more familiar terms with Shakspeare, than with the most intimate of his contemporaries; and it may be questioned whether the Religio Medici, that truly individual creed, had a more devout admirer in its originator, than was Elia. He assures us that he was “shy of facing the prospective,” and no antiquarian cherished a deeper reverence for old china, or black letter. Most honestly, therefore, came our author by that charming relish of olden time, which sometimes induces in our minds, as we read his lucubrations, a lurking doubt whether, by some mischance, we have not fallen upon an old author in a modern dress. There is another feature in the style of these essays, to 28* which we are disposed to assign no inconsiderable influence. We allude to a certain confessional tone, that is peculiarly attractive. There is something exceedingly gratifying to the generality of readers in personalities. On the same principle that we are well pleased to become the confident of a friend, and open our breasts to receive the secret of his inmost experience, we readily become interested in a writer who tells us, in a candid, naïve manner, the story not merely of his life, in the common acceptation of the term, but of his private opinions, humors, eccentric tastes, and personal antipathies. A tone of this kind, is remarkably characteristic of Lamb. And yet there is in it nothing egotistical; for we may say of him as has been said of his illustrious schoolfellow, whom he so significantly, and, as it were, prophetically, called “the inspired charity boy;”—that “in him the individual is always merged in the abstract and general.” Writers have not been slow to avail themselves of the advantage of thus occasionally and incidentally presenting glimpses of their private notions and sentiments; indeed, this has been called the age of confessions; but with Elia, they are so delicately yet so familiarly imparted, that they become a secret charm inwrought through the whole tissue of what he denominates his “weaved up follies.” There are passages scattered through these volumes, which exemplify the very perfection of our language. There are successive periods, so adroitly adapted to the sentiment they embody, so easy and expressive, and, at the same time, so unembellished, that they suggest a new idea of the capabilities of our vernacular. There are words, too, at which we should pause, if they were indited by another, to institute a grave inquiry into their legitimacy, or, perchance, prefer against their author the charge of senseless affectation. But with what we know of Elia, in catching ourselves at such a process, we could not but waive the ceremony, and say, as he said on some equally heartless occasion—“it argues an insensibility.” Another striking trait of the Essays of Elia, is the familiarity of their style. In this respect they frequently combine the freedom of oral with the more deliberative spirit of epistolary expression. We have already alluded to one effect of this method of address; it annihilates the distance between the reader and the author, and so to speak, brings them face to face. Facility in this kind of writing, is one of the principal elements in what is called magazine talent. It consists in maintaining a conversational tone while discussing a topic of great interest in a humorous way, or making a light one the nucleus for spirited, amusing, or instructive ideas. The dearth of this popular tact in this country and its fertility in England, are well known. We think the discrepance can be accounted for by reference to the essential difference in the social habits of the two countries. The literary clubs are the nurseries of this attractive talent in Great Britain. The custom of convening for intellectual recreation, favors the growth of a ready expression of thought, and of a direct and inviting flow of language. Writers are habituated to an attractive style by being trained in a school of conversation. Intimate connection with the best minds, not only informs and kindles, but induces vivacity of delivery both in speech and writing. We can conceive, for instance, of no inspiration even to the colloquial powers of an intelligent man, like direct communion with such an individual as Mackintosh; and we can find no cause for wonder, that one blessed with the companionship of the literati of London and Edinburgh, should acquire the power of talking on paper in a delightful and finished manner. Such society affords, if we may be allowed the expression, a kind of intellectual gymnasium, where the art of interesting with the pen may be, and naturally is, acquired by such as are endowed with native wit, and reflective or graphic ability. With us the case is so widely different, the opportunities for general and exciting association so rare, that it is no matter of surprise that magazine talent, as it is termed, should be of slow growth. How far Charles Lamb was indebted to his social privileges for his style, we are not prepared to say. Yet there are numerous indications of the happy influence of which we speak, interspersed through his commentaries on men and things. We refer, of course, altogether to the style; for as to the ideas, they are entirely his own, bearing the genuine stamp of originality. It seems essential to an efficient light literature, that those interested in its culture should be brought into frequent contact with each other, and with general society. A poet who would evolve representations of humanity in abstract forms, who would present models beyond and above his age, may indeed find, in the shades of retirement, greater scope and a less disturbed scene where in to rear his imaginary fabric; and the philosopher whose aim is the application of truth to history, or the delineation of some important principle in science or art, doubtless requires comparative solitude. The position of both is contemplative. The fancy of the one would plume itself for flight, and the eyry of the noblest birds is always among uninvaded haunts; the reflection of the other would grapple with the abstract, and the deepest elemental strife of nature is ever amid her lofty cloud-retreats, or solitary depths. But the writer who would beguile, amuse or teach his contemporaries by some winning literary device, who would accomplish all these objects at once, and “do it quickly,” must mix with his fellow-creatures, and make a study of the passers-by. He must hold familiar intercourse with the ruling school; not to adopt their principles, but to become disciplined by their conversation; and he should note the multitude warily, in order to discover both the way and the means of affecting them. The legitimate essayist has need of a rich vocabulary, and a flexible manner; a quick perception, and a candid address. And these equipments, if not attainable, are at least improvable, by social aids. Conversation, were it not utterly misunderstood and perverted might prove a mighty agent in the culture of the noblest of human powers, and the sweetest of human graces. There was a beautiful fidelity to nature in the habits of the philosophers of the Garden. There are few pictures so delightful in ancient history, as the noble figure of a Grecian sage moving through a rural resort, or beneath a spacious portico, imparting to his youthful companion lessons of wisdom, or curbing his own advanced mind to pioneer that of his less mature auditor through the early mazes of mental experience. The teeming presence of nature and art in all their variety and eloquence, the appeal to sympathy lurking in the very tones of wisdom, the mere inspiration of human presence, combine to create an impression infinitely more vivid than lonely gleanings among written lore could awaken. We are slow to comprehend the capabilities of conversation, or we should cultivate it sedulously, and with a deeper faith. The single effect which we have noticed in relation to English literature, is of itself no inconsiderable argument. If to social culture we may in a great degree ascribe the exuberance of talent for periodical literature on the other side of the water, there is surely no small inducement to elevate and quicken the conversational spirit of our country; for whatever rank be assigned to this form of writing, its history sufficiently attests the great influence it is capable of exerting, and the important purposes it may subserve. Elia, we think, gives very satisfactory indications of his origin. Without the local allusions and constant references to native authors, there is something about him which smacks of London. Individual as Lamb is, he is not devoid of national characteristics; and a reader, well aware of the composite influences operative upon men of letters who hail from the British metropolis, will readily discover, though not informed of the fact, that Elia was blessed with a score of honorable friends, who have contributed to the literary fame of Great Britain. Lamb is not singular in his attachment to minutiæ; it is characteristic of the literature of the day. In former times, writers dealt in the general; now they are devoted to the particular. In almost every book of travels and work of fiction, we are entertained, or rather the attempt is made to entertain us, with exceedingly detailed descriptions of the features of a landscape, the grouping in a picture, or the several parts of a fashionable dress. By such wearisome nomenclature, it is expected that an adequate conception will be imparted, when in many cases, a single phrase, revealing the impression made by these objects, would convey more than a hundred such inventories. Lamb, by virtue of his nice perception, renders details more effective than we should imagine was practicable. In a single line, we have the peculiarities of a person presented; and by a brief mention of the gait, demeanor, or perhaps a single habit, the ceremony of introduction is over; we not only stand and look in the direction we are desired, but we see the object, be it an old bencher, or a grinning chimney sweep; an ancient courtyard, or a quaker meeting; a roast pig, or an old actor; Captain Jackson, or a poor wretch in the pillory, consoling himself by fanciful soliloquies. We have compared essays, in their general uses, to a set of cabinet pictures. Elia's are peculiarly susceptible of the illustration. They are the more valuable, inasmuch as the mellow hue of old paintings broods over them; here and there a touch of beautiful sadness, that reminds us of Raphael; now a line of penciling, overflowing with nature, which brings some favorite Flemish scene to mind; and again, a certain dreamy softness and delicate finish that whisper of Claude Lorraine. There are two points in which Charles Lamb was eminent, where tolerable success is rare; these are pathos and humor. He understood how to deal with the sense of the humorous and pathetic. He seems to have been intuitively learned in the secret and delicate nature of these attributes of the mind; or rather, it would appear that his own nature, in these respects, furnished a happy criterion by which to address the same feelings in others. We cannot analyse, however casually, the humor and pathos of Elia, without perceiving that they are based on a discerning, and, if the expression may be allowed, a sentimental fellow-feeling for his kind. So ready and true was this feeling, that we find him entering, with the greatest facility, into the experience of human beings whom the mass of society scarcely recognize as such. He talks about a little chimney sweep, and aged mendicant, or an old actor, as if he had, in his own person, given proof of the doctrine to which his ancient friend, Sir Thomas Browne inclined, and actually, by a kind of metempsychois, experienced these several conditions of life. His pathos and humor are, for the most part, descriptive; he appeals to us, in an artist-like and dramatic way, by pictures; we are not wearied with any preparatory and worked up process; we are not led to anticipate the effect. But our associations are skilfully awakened; an impression is unostentatiously conveyed, and a smile or tear first leads us to inquire into the nature of the spell. It is as though in riding along a sequestered road, we should suddenly pass a beautiful avenue, and catch a glimpse of a garden, a statue, an old castle, or some object far down its green vista, so interesting that a reminiscence, an anticipation, or, perchance, a speculative reverie, is thereby at once awakened. Endeavors to touch the feelings or excite quiet mirth fail, generally, because the design is too obvious, or a strain of exaggeration is indulged in, fatal to the end in view. Frequently, too, the call upon our mirthful or compassionate propensities is too direct and strong. These feelings are not seldom appealed to, as if they were passions, and to be excited by passionate means. Indignation, enthusiasm, and all powerful impulses, are doubtless to be roused by fervent appeals; but readers are best allured into a laugh, and it is by gentle encroachments upon its empire, that the heart is best moved to sympathy. In drawing his pictures, Lamb indulged not in caricature. It is his truth, not less than his quaintness and minute touches, that entertains and affects us. He avoids, too, the vulgar modes of illustration. Not by description of physiognomy or costume, does he excite our risible tendencies, nor thinks he to win our pity by over-drawn statements of the insignia and privations of poverty. Elia is is no poor metaphysician. He comprehends the delicacy of touch required in the limner who would impressively delineate, even in a quaint style, any element or form of humanity. By what would almost seem a casual suggestion, we often have a conception imparted worth scores of wire-drawn exemplifications. Well aware was our essayist that a single leaf whirled by the breeze of accident upon the soul's clear fountain, would awaken successive undulations of thought. He was versed in the philosophy of association. He possessed the susceptibility of an affectionate nature, and that fine sense of the appropriate which is one of the most valuable of our insights; and accordingly, he 29 caused his inimitable shades of humor and pathos “to faintly mingle, yet distinctly rise.” He wishes us to realise the sufferings of poor children, and, by briefly indicating the mere tenor of their street-talk, causes our hearts to melt at the piteous accents of care, from lips so young. He would vindicate that excellent precept in the counsel of old Polonius,—“Neither a borrower nor a lender be;” and draws such a full-length portrait of the former character, that when one of the species has once inspected it, he can never again lay the flattering unction of self-ignorance to his heart. He reprimands book-stealers by describing his own impoverished shelves, and points out the blessings of existence, by quaintly discussing the privations attendant upon its loss. The anniversaries of time pass not by without their several merits being canvassed by his pen; and although he tells us little that is absolutely new, he holds the light of his pleasant humor up to the faces of these annual visitants, and thenceforth their features possess greater reality and are more easily recognised. Not a little of Lamb's humor is shadowed forth in the subject of his essays. Had we fallen upon such titles in the index of any other anonymous author, we should have set him down as one who, in straining after the novel, evidenced a morbid taste; but there is nothing more characteristic of Elia, than the topics he selects. They are as legitimate as an undoubted signature. Should this be questioned, let the treatment bestowed upon these uninvestigated themes, be examined. They will prove as well adapted to their author's genius as the life of the Scottish peasant was to Burn's muse, or the praise of Laura to Petrarch. Who should have written the history of England, among the many who have tried their skill in that illustrious task, may be a matter of doubt; and to what American Scott are we to look for a series of romances illustrative of our history, is yet a subject of speculation; but no man, of ordinary perception, we presume, can for a moment question that “The Melancholy of Tailors,”— “the Character of an Undertaker,”—“the Praise of Chimney-sweepers,”—the “Inconvenience of being Hanged,” and sundry kindred subjects, were reserved for the pen of Elia. That writer is wise who avails himself of a somwhat familiar idea, in presenting his mental creations to the public. There is need of as much consideration in bestowing a name upon an essay or a poem, which we wish should be read, as in naming a child whom we would dedicate to fame. The same reasons for circumspection obtain in both cases. The more original the appellation, provided it is not utterly foreign to all general associations, the better. But it is essential that there should be something which will create an interest at a glance. Our essayist has been happy in his choice of subjects; his wit failed him not here. Though no one has previously written the “Praise of Chimney-sweepers,” yet every one sees the dusky urchins daily, and would fain know what can be said in their behalf. Most people have noticed the “Melancholy of Tailors,” and are glad to find that some one has undertaken philosophically to explain it. The headings of all Elia's papers are exactly such as would beguile us into reading when we desire to enter the region of quiet thought, and forget our cares in some literary pastime. There is one element of genius, the influence of which we have never seen acknowledged, that ever impresses our minds in reflecting on the themes to which gifted men apply themselves. We allude to a certain daring which induces them to grapple with topics, and give expression to thoughts, which many have mused upon without thinking of giving them utterance. There is much of Byron's poetry which seems almost like a literal transcript of our past or occasional emotions; the more powerful and acknowledged a genius, the more fervently do we declare the coincidence of our feelings with his delineations. Many odd speculations have occurred to us in reference to the strange subjects to which Lamb is partial; we respond to most of his portraitures, and sympathise in the feelings he avows. His humor and pathos, therefore, are true, singulary, beautifully true, to human nature; in this consists their superiority. Many have aimed at the same results in a similar way; but the genius of Lamb, in this department, has achieved no ordinary triumph. The drama was a rich source of pleasure and reflection to Lamb. During a life passed almost wholly in the metropolis, the theatre afforded him constant recreation, and the species of exitement his peculiar genius required. It was to him an important element in the imaginative being he cherished. By means of it, he continually renewed and brightened the rich vein of sentiment inherent in his nature. To him it addressed language rife with the meaning which characterised its ancient voice,—full of suggestive and impressive eloquence. Deeply versed in the whole range of dramatic literature, master of the philosophy of Shakspeare, and overflowing with a highly cultivated taste for the dramatic art, the drama was ranked by Elia among the redeeming things of life. He did not coldly recognise, but deeply felt, its importance to modern society. Surrounded by the bustle, the worldliness and the material agencies of a populous capital, he daily saw man struggling on beneath the indurating pressure of necessity, or presenting only artificial aspects,—and to the strong and true representation of human nature, on the stage and in the works of the dramatist, he looked as a noble means of renovation. It gratified his humane spirit, that the poor mechanic should lose, for an hour, the memory of his toilsome lot, in sympathy with some vivid personation of that love which once sent a glow to his now hallow temples; that the creature of fashion and pride should, occasionally, be led back to the primal fountains of existence by the hand of Thespis; that an unwonted tear should sometimes be drawn, like a pearl from the deep, to the eye of some fair worlding, at the mighty appeal of nature, in the voice of an affecting portrayer of her truth. Elia had faith in the legitimate drama, as the native offspring of the human mind, significant of its successive eras, and as fitted to supply one of its truest and deepest wants; and well he might have had, for its history was as familiar to him as a household tale; he had explored its chronicles with the assiduity of an enthusiast, and the acumen of a virtuoso; he had garnered up its gems as the true jewels of his country's literature; he 29* honored its worthy votaries as ministrants at the altar of humanity; and, above all, in his own experience, he had learned what human taste, judgment and feeling, may derive from the wise appropriation of dramatic influence. He knew, as well as his readers, how much he was indebted to an intelligent devotion to them, for the vividness of his pencilings, the fertility of his associations, and the beauty of his imagery. Not in vain did he seek, in Hamlet's musings, “grounds more relative” than popular reading could afford, or turn from the inconsistencies of modern gallantry, which he so admirably delineated, to bestow his fond attentions upon the “bright angel” of Verona, and “the gentle lady wedded to the Moor.” Lamb's interest in the drama was too well founded to be periodical, as is generally the case. He shared, indeed, the common destiny, in beholding his youthful visions of theatrical glory fade; the time came to him, as it comes to all, when the mysterious curtain was reduced to its actual quality, and became bona fide green baize, and when the polished pilasters lost their likeness to “glorified sugar candy;” but the histrionic art retained its interest, and the literature of the drama yielded a continual pastime. From the rainy afternoon which the “child Elia” spent in such hope and fear, lest the wayward elements should deprive him of his “first play”—to the night when the sleep of the man Elia was disturbed with visions of old Muden—he sought and found, in the drama, food for his reflective humor and pleasurable occupancy in his weary moods—if such e'er came to him— which may be doubted, since he has not so informed us. Notwithstanding his partiality for theatrical representations, few play-goers entertained a more just idea of their frequent and necessary inadequateness. He recognised the limits of the dramatic art. He realised, beyond the generality of Shakspeare's admirers, the impossibility of presenting, by the most successful performance, our deepest conception of his characters. He knew that the wand of that enchanter dealt with things too deep, not only for speech, but for expression. He was impatient at the common interpretation of Shakspeare's mind. In the stillness of his retired study, the creations of the bard appeared to him, as in an exalted dream. In the attentive perusal of his plays,—the delicate touches, the finer shades, the under current of philosophy, were revealed to the mind of Lamb with an impressiveness, of which personification is unsusceptible; and few of his essays are more worthy of his genius than that which embodies his views on this subject. It should be attentively read by all who habitually honor the minstrel of Avon, without being perfectly aware why the honor is due. It will lead such to new investigations into the mysteries of that wonderful tragic lore, upon which the most gifted men have been proud to offer one useful comment, or advance a single illustrative hint. To the acted and written drama, Lamb assigned an appropriate office; he believed each had its purpose and that he who would derive the greatest benefit from either, should study them relatively and in conjunction. Such was his own method, and to the steadiness and success with which he pursued it, his writings bear the most interesting testimony. The goût with which he dwells upon his dramatic reminiscences, the delight he takes in living over scenes of this kind,—in recalling, after an interval of years, the enjoyment of a single evening of Liston's or Bensley's acting, indicate the intelligence and warmth of his love of theatrical performances; while his successful efforts in reviving the nearly forgotten dramatic literature of the English stage, and his admirable essays, directly or indirectly devoted to the general subject, evince his application and attachment to it. His talents as a dramatic critic are everywhere visible. There is one feature of our author's devotion to the drama, which is too characteristic of the man, and too intrinsically pleasing, to be unnoticed. He never forgot those who had contributed to his pleasure in this manner. They were not to him the indifferent, unestimated beings they are to the majority of those who are amused and instructed by their labors. Charles Lamb respected the genius of a splendid tragedian on the same grounds that that of a fine sculptor won his admiration. He believed one as heaven-bestowed as the other. He recognized his intellectual or moral obligations to an affecting actor as readily as to a favorite author. He sincerely respected the ideality of the profession, sympathised in the life of toil and comparative isolation it imposes, and felt for the deserving and ambitious who had, by assiduous culture and native energy, risen to its summit only to look forward from that long sought elevation, to a brief continuance of success, followed by an unhonored decline, an age of neglect, and the world's oblivion. One of Lamb's most winning traits is his sincerity. The attractiveness of this beautiful virtue, even in literature, is worthy of observation. It seems to be an ordination of the intellectual world, and a blessed one it is to those who cherish faith in a spiritual philosophy—that truth of expression shall alone prove powerfully and permanently effective. It is happy that we are so constituted as to be moved chiefly, if not solely, by voices attuned and awakened by genuine emotion; it is well when foreign aids and the most insinuating of conventional appliances fail to deceive us into admiration of an artificial literary aspirant; it is a glorious distinction of our common nature, that soul-prompted language is the only universally acknowledged eloquence. The mission of individual genius is to exhibit itself. The advocacy of popular opinions, the illustration of prevailing theories— the literary party-work of the day, may be undertaken by such as are unconscious of any more special and personal calling. But let there be a self-preaching priesthood in the field of letters and of art, to teach the great lesson of human individuality. Let some gifted votaries of literature and philosophy breathe original symphonies, instead of merging their rich tones in the general chorus. Unfortunate is the era when such men are not; and thrice illustrious that in which they abound. The history of the world proves this; and in proportion as an author is sincere, in whatever age, he deserves our respect. We spontaneously honor minds of this order, in whatever form they are encountered. The complacent smile with which douce Davie Deans, in Scott's most beautiful tale, hears himself denominated a Deanite, recommends him to our esteem. And when a poet or an essayist is as habitually and earnestly candid as is Elia, we feel and acknowledge his worth, whatever may be the calibre of his genius. Many and singular are the advantages attendant upon this characteristic. The most obvious is that it brings out the true power—the propium ingenium—of the individual. Look at the history of Milton and Dante. They surveyed their immediate social circumstances for a reflection of themselves in vain; and then in calm confidence they turned to the mirror fountain within themselves, and thence evolved thoughts—unappreciated, indeed, by their contemporaries, yet in the view of posterity none the less oracular. And such intellectual laborers— however confined and comparatively unimportant the sphere of effort—being absolved from any undue allegiance to merely temporary influences, give to their productions a free and personal stamp. Truth is to literature, what, in the view of the alchymists, the philosopher's stone was to the base metals; it converts all it touches into gold. And, although our author had to do mainly with topics which a superficial reasoner would term trifling, yet his lovely sincerity gives them a character, and sheds upon them a warm and soothing light more pleasing than weightier themes, less ingenously treated, can often boast. Being sincere, of course Elia wrote only from the inspiration of his overflowing spirit; he seems to have penned every line, to have thrown off every essay, con amore. He did not require the expedient of the Greek painter, who covered the face of one of his great figures with a mantle, not daring to attempt a portraiture of the intense grief which he represented him as suffering. Lamb endeavored not to express what he did not feel; he wrote not from necessity or policy, but from enthusiasm, from his own gentle, sweet, yet deep enthusiasm. He had a feeling for the art of writing, and therefore he would not make it the hackneyed conventional agent it often is; but ever regarded it as a crystalline mould wherein he could faithfully present the form, hues, and very spirit of his sentiments and speculations. A striking and delightful consequence of this literary sincerity is, that it preserves and developes the proper humanity of the author. Literati of this class are utterly devoid of pedantry. In society, and the common business of life, they are as other men, except that a finer sensibility, and more elevated general taste, distinguishes them. In becoming writers, they cease not to be men. Literature is then, indeed, what the English poet would have it,—“an honorable augmentation” to our arms; it is not exclusively pursued as if it were life's only good, and a human being's sole aim; but it is applied to as a beautiful accomplishment—a poetical recreation amid less humanizing influences. Thus, instead of serving merely as an arena for the display of selfish ambition, or a cell wherein unsocial and barren devotion may find scope, it is valued chiefly as the means of embodying the unforced impressions of our own natures, for the happiness and improvement of our fellow creatures. We say that such a view must be taken by sincere authors of their vocation, because they cannot but feel that by the very constitution of their natures, literature is only a part of the great whole of the soul's being—a single form of its development, and one among the thousand offices to which the versatile mind is called. It is needless to prove, in detail, Lamb's sincerity. It is, perhaps, his most prominent characteristic; but in tracing out and dwelling upon its influence, we are newly impressed with the truth of Shaftesbury's declaration, that “wisdom is more from the heart than from the head.” We have ever remarked that the most delightful and truly sincere writers are the most suceptible, affectionate, and unaffected men. We have felt, that however intellectually endowed, the feelings of such individuals are the true sources of their power. Sympathy we consider one of the primal principles of efficient genius. It is this truth of feeling which enabled Shakspeare to depict so strongly the various stages of passion, and the depth, growth, and gradations of sentiment. In whom does this primitive readiness to sympathize—to enter into all the moods of the soul—continue beyond early life, so often as in men devoted to imaginative objects? How frequently are we struck with the child-like character of artists and poets! It sometimes seems as if, along with childhood's ready sympathy, many of the other characteristics of that epoch were projected into the more mature stages of being. “There is often,” says Madame de Staël, “in true genius a sort of awkwardness, similar, in some respects, to the credulity of sincere and noble souls.” This readiness to catch impressions, this delicacy and warmth of sympathy which belongs to the sincere school of writers, is inestimable. It is said that a musical amateur traversed the whole of Ireland, and gathered from the peasants the delightful airs to which Moore's beautiful Irish melodies were afterwards adapted. How much of the charm of those sweet songs is owing to their associations with the native and simple music thus gleaned from voices to which it had traditionally descended! And it is by their sympathy—their sincere and universal interest in humanity, that the sweetest poets, the most renowned dramatists, and such humble gleaners in the field of letters, as our quaint essayist, are enabled to write in a manner corresponding with the heaven-attuned, unwritten music of the human heart. Sincerity gives them the means of interpreting for their fellow beings—not only the lofty subjects which filled the soul of the “blind bard of Paradise,” and the broad range of life upon which the observant mind of the poet of human nature was intent, but those lesser and more unique themes which Elia loved to speculate about, and humorously illustrate. There is a unity of design in the essays of Elia. Disconnected and fugitive as we should deem them at first sight, an attentive persual reveals, if not a complete theory, yet a definite and pervading spirit which is not devoid of philosophy. After being amused by Lamb's humor, interested by his quaintness, and fascinated by his style, there yet remains a more deep impression upon our minds. We feel that he had a specific object as an essayist; or, at least, that the ideas he suggests tend to a particular result. 30 What, then, was his aim? As an author, what mission does he fulfil? We think Charles Lamb is to life what Wordsworth is to nature. The latter points out the field flowers, and the meadow rill, the soul's most primal and simple movements, the mind's most single and unsophisticated tendencies; the former indicates the lesser, and scarcely noticed sources of pleasure and annoyance, mirth and reflection, which occur in the beaten track of ordinary life. It was remarked, by an able critic, of the author of the Lyrical Ballads, that, “he may be said to take a personal interest in the universe;” with equal truth Elia may be regarded as taking a personal interest in life. He delighted in designating its every-day, universal, and for that very reason—disregarded experiences. Leaving the delineation of martyrdoms, and the deeper joys of the heart, to more ambitious writers, he preferred to dwell upon the misery of children when left awake in their solitary beds in the dark; to shadow forth the peace destroying phantom of a “poor relation;” to draw up eloquent bacheloric complaints of the behavior of “married people;” to describe in touching terms, the agony of one condemned to hear music “without an ear;” and to lament pathetically the unsocial aspect of a metropolitan Sabbath, and the disturbing, heartless conduct of those who remove old landmarks. He did not sorrow only over minor miseries, but gloried in minor pleasures. To him, “Elysian exemptions” from ordinary toil—a sweet morning's nap— a “sympathetic solitude”—an incidental act or emotion of benevolence, and, especially, those dear “treasures cased in leathern covers,” for which he was so thankful that he assures us that he could say grace before reading them;— these, and such as these, were to Charles Lamb absolute and recognized blessings. He seems to have broken away from the bondage of custom and to have seen all things new. One would think, to note the freshness of his perceptions in regard to the most familiar objects of London, that in manhood he was for the first time initiated into city life—that he was a new comer in the world at an advanced age. Hogarth found no more delight in his street-pencilings, than Lamb in his by-way speculations. In the voyage of life he seemed to be an ordained cicerone, directing attention to that lesser world of experience to which the mass of men are insensible,—drawing their attention from far-off visions of good, and oppressive reminiscences of grief, to the low green herbage, springing up in their way, and the soft gentle voices breathing at their firesides, and around their daily steps. And there is truth in Elia's philosophy, for,— “If rightly trained and bred, Humanity is humble,—finds no spot Her heaven-guided feet refuse to tread.” We never rise from one of his essays without a feeling of contentment. He leads our thoughts to the actual, available springs of enjoyment. He reconciles us to ourselves; causing home-pleasures, and the charms of the wayside, and the mere comforts of existence, to emerge from the shadow into which our indifference has cast them, into the light of fond recognition. The flat dull surface of common life, he causes to rise into beautiful basso-relievo. In truth, there are few better teachers of gratitude than Lamb. He rejuvenates our worn and weary feelings, revives the dim flame of our enthusiasm, opens our eyes to real and present good, and with his humorous accents, and unpretending manner, reads us a homily on the folly of desponding, and the wisdom of appreciating the cluster of minor joys which surround, and may be made continually to cheer our being. We have endeavored to designate the most prominent of Charles Lamb's traits as an essayist. There is, however, one point to which all that we know of the man converges. His literary and personal example tends to one striking lesson, which should not be thoughtlessly received. We allude to his singular and constant devotion to the ideal. Indeed he is one of those beings who make us deeply and newly feel how much there is within a human spirit,—how independent it may become of extrinsic aids,— how richly it may live to itself. Here is an individual whose existence was, for the most part, spent within the smoky precincts of London; first a school-boy at a popular institution, then a laborious clerks, and at length a “lean annuitant.” Public life, with its various mental incitements,—foreign travel, with its thousand fertilizing associations,—fortune, with the unnumbered objects of taste she affords,—ministered not to him. Yet with what admirable constancy did he follow out that sense of the beautiful, and the perfect, which he regarded as most essentially himself! How ardently did he cherish an ideal life! When outward influences and social restrictions encroached upon this, his great end,—the drama, his favorite authors, a work of art, or a musing hour, were proved restoratives. He did not gratify his fondness for antiquity among the ruins of the ancient world; but the Temple cloisters, or an old folio, were more eloquent to him of the past, than the Coloseum is to the mass of travellers. He knew not the happiness of conjugal affection; but his attachment to a departed object was to him a spring of as deep joy, as the unimaginative often find in an actual passion. No little prattlers came about him at even-tide; but dream-children, as lovely as cherubs, solaced his lonely hours. The taste, the love, the very being of Charles Lamb, was ideal. The struggles for power and gain went on around him; but the tumult disturbed not his repose. The votaries of pleasure swept by him with all the insignia of gaiety and fashion; but the dazzle and laugh of the careless throng lured him not aside. He felt it was a blessed privilege to stand beneath the broad heavens, to saunter through the fields, to muse upon the ancient and forgotten, to look into the faces of men, to rove on the wings of fancy, to give scope to the benevolent affections, and especially to evolve from his own breast a light “touching all things with hues of heaven;” in a word to be Elia. And is there not a delight in contemplating such a life beyond that which the annals of noisier and more heartless men inspire? In an age of restless activity, associated effort, and a devotion to temporary ends, is there not an unspeakable charm in the character of a consistent idealist? When we can recall so many instances of the perversion of the poetical temperament in gifted natures, through passion and error, is 30* there not consolation in the serene and continuous gratification with which it blessed Lamb? He has now left forever, the haunts accustomed to his presence. No more will Elia indite quaint reminiscences and humorous descriptions for our pleasure; no more will his criticism enlighten, his pathos affect, or his aphorisms delight us. But his sweet and generous sympathies, his refined taste for the excellent in letters, his grateful perception of the true good of being, his ideal spirit, dwells latently in every bosom. And all may brighten andr adiate it, till life's cold pathway is warm with the sunshine of the soul.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">MISCELLANY. THE BACHELOR RECLAIMED; A SKETCH FROM REAL LIFE. “So, you are determined not to marry?” “Absolutely.” “And why?” “In the first place, I never expect to be able to support a wife according to my ideas of comfort. In the second place, I have no hope of meeting a woman who will sympathise sufficiently with my feelings and views, to be a congenial companion. Thirdly, I cannot bear the idea of adopting as constant associates the relations of her I may love, and fourthly, I consider housekeeping and all the details of domestic arrangements, the greatest bore in existence.” This colloquy took place between two young men, in the garden of one of the fashionable hotels at Saratoga. It was a sultry afternoon, and they had retired under the shade of an apple-tree, to digest their dinner, which process they were facilitating by occasionally puffing some very mild, light-brown Havana segars. The last remarks were uttered in a very calm and positive tone, by McNiel, a philosophical and quiet gentleman, who had a most sensible theory for everything in life. Among other things, he took great pleasure in the conviction that he thoroughly understood himself. The first time his interest was truly excited by a member of the gentler sex, he had acted in the most extravagant manner, and barely escaped with honor from forming a most injudicious connection. To guard against similar mishaps, he had adopted a very ingenious plan. Being uncommonly susceptible to female attractions, he made it a rule when charmed by a sweet face, or thrilled by a winning voice, to seek for some personal defect or weakness of character, in the fair creature, and obstinately dwell upon these imperfections, until they cast a shade over the redeeming traits, and dissolved the spell he feared. When this course failed, he had but one resource. With Falstaff, he thought discretion the better part of valor, and deliberately fled from the allurements that threatened his peace. Thus he managed not to allow love to take permanent possession, and, after various false alarms and exciting vigils, came to the conclusion that no long siege or sudden attack would ever subdue the citadel of his affections, But McNiel had so braced himself in a spirit of resistance, that he had made no provision against the unconscious lures of beauty. He could chat, for hours, with a celebrated belle, and leave her without a sigh; he could smile at the captivating manners which over-came his fellows. Regarding society as a battle-field, he went thither armed at all points, resolved to maintain his self-possession, and be on the watch against the wiles of woman. He had seen lovely girls in the drawing-room, followed their graceful movements in the dance, heard them breathe songs of sentiment at the piano, and walked beside them on the promenade. On these occasions, he coolly formed an estimate of their several graces, perfeetly appreciated every finely-chiselled nose and tempting lip, noted with care the hue and expression of the eye, but walked proudly away at parting, murmuring to himself, “all this I see, yet am not in love.” But who can anticipate the weapon that shall lay him low, or make adequate provision against the inexhaustible resources of love? McNiel had sat for a week at table, opposite an invalid widow and her daughter. He had passed them potatoes not less than a dozen times, and helped the young lady twice to cherry-pie. The only impression he had derived from their demeanor and appearance, was, that they were very genteel and quiet. On the morning after his conversation in the garden, he awoke just before sunrise, and found himself lying with his face to the wall, in one of the diminutive chambers in which visitors to the Springs are so unceremoniously packed. His eyes opened within six inches of the plaster; and he amused himself for some minutes, in conjuring the cracks and veins it displayed, into imaginary forms of warriors and animals. At length his mind reverted to himself, and his present quarters. “Well, I've been here just a fortnight,” thus he mused, “and a pretty dull time I've had of it. Day after day, the same stupid routine. In the morning I swallow six glasses of Congress water at the spring, with the hollow eyes of that sick minister from Connecticut glaring on me like a serpent, and the die-away tones of that nervous lady from Philadelphia, sounding like a knell in my ears. I cannot drink in peace for those everlasting Misses Hill, who all three chatter at once, and expect me to be entertaining and talkative so early in the morning, with my stomach full of cold liquid, and a long dull day in perspective! Then comes breakfast. The clatter of plates, the murmur of voices, the rushing of the black waiters, and the variety of steams, make me glad to retreat. I find a still corner of the piazza, and begin to read; but the flies, a draught of air, or the intrusive gabble of my acquaintances, utterly prevent me from becoming absorbed in a book. It has now grown too warm to walk, and I look in vain for Dr. Clayton, who is the only man here whose conversation interests me. I avoid the billiard-room because I know who I shall meet there. The swing is occupied. The thrumming on the piano of that old maid from Providence, makes the saloon uninhabitable. They are talking politics in the bar-room. The very sight of the newspapers gives me a qualm. I involuntarily begin to doze, when that infernal gong sounds the hour to dress. No matter; any thing for a relief. Dinner is insufferable; more show and noise, than relish and comfort. How gladly I escape to the garden and smoke! That reminds we of what I told Jones, yesterday, about matrimony. 31 He laughed at me. But there's no mistake about it. Catch me to give up my freedom, and provide for a family—be pestered with a whole string of new connections, when I can't bear those I have now—never have a moment to myself—be obliged to get up in the night for a doctor—have to pay for a boy's schooling, and be plauged to death by him for my pains—be bothered constantly with bad servants—see my wife lose her beauty, in a twelve-month from, care—my goddess become a mere household drudge—give up segars—keep precise hours—take care of sick children—go to market! never, never, never!” As his reverie thus emphatically terminated, NcNiel slowly raised himself to a sitting posture, in order to ascertain the state of the weather, when a sight presented itself which at once put his philosophy to flight and startled him from his composure. He did not cry out, but hushed his very breath. Beside him lay a female form in profound slumber. Her hair had escaped from its confinement, and fell in the richest profusion around her face. There was a delicate glow upon the checks. The lips were scarcely parted. The brow was perfectly serene. One arm was thrust under her head, the other lay stretched upon the coverlid. It was one of those accidental attitudes which sculptors love to embody. The bosom heaved regularly. He felt that it was the slumber of an innocent creature, and that beneath that calm breast beat a kindly and pure heart. He bent over the vision, for so at first it seemed to him, as did Narcissus above the crystal water. The peaceful beauty of that face entered his very soul. He trembled at the still regularity of the long, dark eye-lashes, as if it were death personified. Recovering himself, all at once something familiar struch him in the countenance. He thought awhile, and the whole mystery was solved. It was the widow's daughter. They occupied the adjoining chamber; she had gone down stairs in the night to procure something for the invalid, and on returning, entered in the darkness, the wrong room, and fancying her mother asleep, had as she thought very quietly taken her place beside her, and was soon lost in slumber. No sooner did this idea take possession of McNiel, than with the utmost caution and a noiseles movement, he stole away and removed every vestige of his presence into a vacant apartment opposite, leaving the fair intruder to suppose she alone had occupied the room At breakfast, he observed the mother and daughter whisper and smile together, and soon ascertained that they had no suspicion of the actual state of the case. With the delicacy that belonged to his character, McNiel in wardly vowed to keep the secret forever in his own breast Meantime, with much apparent hilarity, he prepared to accompany Jones to Lake George. His companion marvelled to perceive this unwonted gaiety wear off a they proceeded in their ride. McNiel became silent and pensive. The evening was fine, and they went upon the lake to enjoy the moonlight. Jones sung his best song and woke the echoes with his bugle. His friend remained silent, wrapt in his cloak, at the boat's stern. At last very abruptly he sprang up, and ordered the rowers to land him. “Where are you going?” inquired Jones “To Saratoga,” was the reply. “Not to-night, surely?' “Yes, now, this instant.” Entertaining some fears for his friend's sanity, Jones reluctantly devoted that lovely night to a hard ride over a sandy road, instead of lingering away its delightful hours, on the sweet bosom of the lake. Six months after, McNiel married the widow's daughter, and the ensuing summer, when I met him at Saratoga, he assured me he found it a delightful residence. HAIR. Hair is an eloquent emblem. It is the mother's pride to dress her child's rich locks; the lover's joy to gaze on the hair-locket of his mistress; the mourner's despair to see the ringlet stir as if in mockery of death, by the marble cheek of the departed. How the hue of hair is hallowed to the fancy! From the “glossy raven” to the “silver sable,” from the “brown in the shadow, and gold in the sun,” to the blonde and silken thread, there is a vocabulary of hues appealing to each memory. The beautiful economy of nature is signally displayed in the human hair. The most simple expedient in the animal frame, the meanest adjunct, as it were, to the figure, yet how effective! “Hyacinthine locks Round from his parted forelock manly hung Clustering, but not beneath his shoulders broad: She, as a veil, down to the slender waist, Her unadorned tresses wore, Disheveled, but in wanton ringlets wav'd, As the vine curls her tendrils, which implies 31* Subjection, but required with gentle sway, And by her yielded, by him best received, Yielded with coy submission, modest pride, And sweet, reluctant, amorous delay.” In this passage, the blind bard of Paradise has interpreted the natural language of woman's hair before the artifices of fashion had marred its natural grace. Whoever has attentively perused one of the pictures of the old masters, where a female figure is represented, must have perceived, perhaps unconsciously, that the long flexible ringlets conveyed an impression to the mind of dependence. The short, tight curls of a gladiatorial statue, on the contrary, give the idea of self-command and unyielding will. There is a poetical charm in the unshorn tresses of a beautiful woman, which Milton has not exaggerated. I have seldom received a more sad conviction of the bitterness of poverty, than was conveyed by the story of a lovely girl in one of the continental towns, who was obliged to sell her hair for bread. She was of humble parentage, but nature had adorned her head with the rarest perfection. Her luxuriant and glowing ringlets, constituted the pride of her heart. She rejoiced in this distinction as the redeeming point of her destiny. Often would a blush of pleasure suffuse her cheek as she caught a stranger's eye regarding them with admiration, when at her lowly toil. The homeliness of her garb, and the poverty of her condition were relieved by this native adornment. It is wonderful to what slight tokens the self-respect of poor mortals will cling, and how the very maintenance of virtue often depends upon some frail association. A strain of music, glimpses of a remembered countenance, a dream, a word, will often annihilate a vile intention, or unseal the fountain of the heart. A palm tree in England drew tears from an Eastern wanderer; and the native wisdom of Jeanie Deans led her to make her first visit to the Duke of Argyle, arrayed in a plaid, knowing his honor's heart “would warm to the tartan.” And thus to the simple-hearted maiden her rich and flowing hair was a crown of glory—the only circumstance that elevated her in her own estimation. And when the iron necessity of want came upon her, and she was a homeless orphan—when every thing had been parted with, and all appeals to compassion had failed, the spirit of the poor creature yielded to hunger, and she sold her hair. Before this sacrifice, she had resisted, with the heroism of innocence, the temptation to purchase food at the expense of honor. But when the wants of nature were appeased, and she went forth shorn of her cherished ornament, the consciousness of her loss induced despair, and she resigned herself hopelessly to a career of infamy. Abundant hair is said to be indicative of strength, and fine hair, of susceptibility. In the hair are written the stern lessons of life. It falls away from the head of sickness, and the brows of the thoughtful. The bright lot of childhood is traced in its golden threads, the free buoyancy of youth is indicated by its wild luxuriance; the throe of anguish, the touch of age, entwine it with a silver tissue; and intensity of spirit will there anticipate the snows of time. The hair of Columbus was white at thirty; and before that period, Shelley's dark waving curls were dashed with snow. In the account of the execution of the unfortunate Mary, the last touch of pathos is given to the scene when it is stated that as the executioner held up the severed head, it was perceived that the auburn locks were thickly strewn with grey. Associations of sentiment attach strongly to the hair. Around it is wreathed the laurel garland of fame. Amid it tremble the flowers of a bridal. Putting up the hair is the signal of womanhood. The Andalusian women always wear roses in their glossy black hair. The barbarous practice of scalping doubtless originated in a savage idea of desecrating the temple of the soul, as well as of gathering trophies of victory. The head is shaven by the monks in token of humility, and the stationary civilization of the Chinese is indicated by no custom more strikingly than that of wearing only a single cue, the very acme of unpicturesque. There were few more characteristic indications of a highly artificial state of society than the absurd style of dressing the head once so fashionable. Even at the present day, no part of female costume betrays individual taste more clearly than the style in which the hair is worn. To tear the hair is a true expression of despair, and the patriarchal ceremony of scattering ashes on the head, was the deepest sign of sorrow. How much the desolate grandeur of the scene on the heath, in Lear, is augmented by his “white flakes” that “challenge pity,” and what a picture we have of Bassanio's love, when he says— “Her sunny locks Hang on her temples like a golden fleece, Which makes her seat at Belmont, Colchos strand, And many Jasons come in quest of her. The women at the siege of Messina, wrought their hair into bow-strings for the archers, and on a similar occasion in the Spanish wars, the females of a small garrison bound their hair under the chin, to appear like beard, and arranging themselves on the ramparts, induced the enemy to surrender. Sampson's hair was singularly associated with his misfortunes, and the abundant locks of Absalom wrought the downfall of his pride. It is often a net to entrap the affections. The hair speaks to the heart. Laura's flying tresses haunted Petrarch's fancy: “Qual Ninfa in fonti, in selve, mai qual Dea Chiome d' oro si fino a l'aura sciolse?” That the hair may figure to advantage in literature, the “Rape of the Lock,” is an immortal proof. The Puritans cut it short and the cavaliers wore it luxuriantly. Human vanity displays itself nowhere more conspicuously than in the arrangement of the hair. When Benedict enumerates the qualifications required in a wife, he says in conclusion—“her hair shall be of what color it please God;”—alluding to the common custom of dyeing the hair. Bassanio, when moralizing on the caskets, utters a satire upon false hair; “So are those crisped snaky, golden locks, Which make such wanton gambols with the wind, Upon supposed fairness, often known To be the dowry of a second head, The scull that bred them in the sepulchre.” Among the beautiful touches, alike true to nature and poetry, in Talfourd's Ion, is the language of the dying Adrastus to his newly-discovered son:— “I am growing weak, And my eyes dazzle; let me rest my hands Ere they have lost their feeling, on thy head, Lo! Lo! thy hair is glossy to the touch As when I last enwreathed its tiny curl About my finger.” It is the surviving memorial of our physicial existence: “There seems a love in hair, though it be dead— It is the gentlest, yet the strongest thread Of our frail plant—a blossom from the tree, Surviving the proud trunk; as if it said, Patience and gentleness is power. In me Behold affectionate eternity.” D'Israeli paints Contarini Fleming, the creature of passion, after his wife's death, as clipping off her long tresses, twining them about his neck, and springing from a precipice. Miss Porter makes Helen Mar embroider into the banner of Wallace, the ensanguined hair of his murdered Marion. Goldsmith's coffin was opened to obtain some of his hair for a fair admirer, and there is a striking anecdote of a man who was prevented from declaring love to his friend's betrothed, by recognizing on the hand he had clasped, a ring, containing the hair of his rival. With what a pathetic expressiveness does the “Cenci” conclude: Beatrice. “Give yourself no unnecessary pain, My dear Lord Cardinal. Here, mother, tie My girdle for me, and bind up my hair In any simple knot; ay, that does well. And yours, I see, is coming down. How often Have we done this for one another! and now We shall not do it any more. My hood! We are quite ready. Well, 'tis very well.” The dialogue between King John and Constance, is very significant:— King Philip. “Bind up those tresses. Oh, what love I note In the fair multitude of those her hairs! Where, but by chance, a silver dross hath fallen, Even to that dross ten thousand wiry friends Do glue themselves in sociable grief; Like true, inseparable, faithful loves, Sticking together in calamity.”Constance. “To England, if you will.”King Philip. “Bind up your hairs.”Constance. “Yes, that I will and wherefore will I do it? I tore them from their bonds; and cried aloud, Oh, that these hands could so redeem my son, As they have given these hairs their liberty! But now I envy at their liberty, And will again commit them to their bonds, Because my poor child is a prisoner.” EYE-LANGUAGE. Of Nature's minuter wonders, the human eye is the paragon.—Vainly will Science explore her rich arcana for a more impressive example of the marvels she would illustrate. But it is not the apparatus which the delicate knife of the anatomist reveals—the retina and lenses, or even their combined arrangement that most strikingly indicates the subtle workmanship involved in the little fleshy globule we call the eye;—it is the effect they produce, the purposes they subserve, the results they accomplish. Far greater are these than the careless crowd dream of; far more marvelous than even the intelligent and imaginative can fully realize. The phenomenon of sight is, indeed, sufficiently extraordinary. Not less so are the minor missions which the visual organ fulfils. The eye speaks—with an eloquence and a truthfulness surpassing speech. It is the window out of which the winged thoughts often fly unwittingly. It is the tiny magic mirror on whose crystal surface the moods of feeling fitfully play, like the sunlight and shadows on a still stream. Yes—if there is one material form through which the spirit is visible, and with which, when humanly embodied, it has specially to do, that form is the EYE. Even in animals it is emphatically the expressive feature. Who that has noted the look of timid fondness with which a recreant dog approaches his master, or observed the gleam of wo with which the dying deer regards his hunters —and has not felt this? How much more significant is the language of the human eye! How ceaselessly does it represent the soul! The instrument by which our most valuable knowledge is received; it is, at the same time, the outward interpreter of the inward world. How immediate and delicate is the spirit's sway over the aspects and movements of this complicated organ! Instinctively it is raised in devotion, and bent downward in shame. When enthusiasm lends fire to the soul, the eye flashes; when pleasure stirs the heart, the eye sparkles; when deep sorrow darkens the bosom, the eye distils hot tears, “faster than Arabian trees their medicinal gum;” when confidence stays the mind, the eye looks forth proudly; when love fills the breast, the eye beams with glad sympathy; when insanity desolates the brain, the eye roves wildly; and —o'er the eye Death most exerts his might, And hurls the spirit from her throne to light. Thus through all the epochs of human experience, the eye typifies the workings of the soul. To a warm-hearted wanderer through the world—to one who finds in his fellow-beings the chief sources of by-way pleasure—to a benevolent cosmopolite who is an adept in eye-language, it is a delightful and constant resource. 32 He may be a silent man as far as regards his organs of speech, yet he is ever conversing. In a stage-coach, by one glance around, he discovers with whom he can find sympathy. With these he interchanges looks during the journey, and enjoys all the delights of sociability with none of its trials. He reads family histories in the eye-language of their members. If he but catch the `bonnie blue e'en' of the passing peasant girl, a cheerful humor is induced which abides with him for hours. And the momentary beaming of a pair of dark lustrous orbs, fills him with high and moving thoughts. A glance to him is rife with expression, beyond that of his vernacular tongue. And thus gazing into these fountains for refreshment, and drawing thence inspiration and solace, his eye at length meets one, the glance of which is deeply responsive—an eye that shines like the star of a happy destiny into his soul, and he is not again contented till the beautiful orb beams only for him, and becomes the light of his home. The most interesting portion of his studies in eye-language is completed. A modern writer, in order to illustrate an almost indescribable sentiment, says `it was like the eye of a woman first-loved to the soul of the poet.' There is no lack of well-authenticated instances to prove the power of eye-language. An infuriated animal has often been kept trembling at bay, by the steadfast gaze of man, beneath which its own angry eye quailed, yet could not turn aside. I knew a venerable man who kept a powerful ruffian quietly seated in his little parlor for an hour at night, while the only servant of his small household was absent in quest of aid, merely by silently fixing upon him a fearless look, such as awed his perverted heart and chained his strong limbs. Many a rebuke has been silently but deeply conveyed, by the calm yet indignant glance of the injured. How intuitively does a child understand the slightest expression of its mother's eye! How well do congenial beings comprehend their affinity before any communion, save that of eye-converse! Consider, too, the singular duration of the impression imparted by this feature. The world abounds with minute symbols. Each small and exquisite flower, gem or insect, addresses the sense of the beautiful; yet they interest but for a moment. What more expressive similitude has poetry found for the stars, than `angels' eyes?' The living gem of nature is the eye, and how like a spell doth its language haunt us! Even in the pictures of the old masters, the effect is often centered in the expression of this single organ. What fanciful man, having an inkling of superstition within him, has not sometimes imagined a portrait animated with life? Shroud the eyes, and the fantasy is gone. It has been finally remarked of Titian's portraits that they look at us more than we at them. We may forget the countenance of a friend from whom we are divided in many respects; but if our interest has ever been truly awakened in a fellow-being, the eye-language of the individual can scarcely escape our memories. Who cannot recall, though he may not describe, the eye-language with which a gifted man, under some strong inspiration, has uttered a memorable thought, or that with which one near and dear to him has breathed aught of deep interest to his ear? The dignity of self-possessed thought was in the eye of Paul, ere his words affected Festus. The beaming glance of the Grecian mother pointed out her jewels before her lips proclaimed them. The unfortunate know a friend and are re-assured, the timid recognise a master spirit and are nerved, and the guilty know their accuser and quail, at the first momentary meeting of their gaze. Beware of the man whose eye you can never meet. Correggio excelled in painting downcast eyes; those of Allston's pictures are remarkable for their grey, intellectual expression. The St. Cecilia of Raphael probably presents the best instance in the art, of the upturned eyes of inspiration. Eye-language is richly illustrated in the pages of Shakspeare. What an idea is given of its perversion in Lear's adjuration to the unfortunate Gloster:— Get thee glass eyes; And like a scurvy politician, seem To see the things thou dost not. Addressing Regan, he says of Goneril, `her eyes are fierce, but thine do comfort and not burn.' Cordelia envies not their `still soliciting eyes' and her more honest orbs, at length, prove their sincerity, by shedding `tears as pearls from diamonds dropp'd.' Othello when first awoke to jealousy, in order to satisfy his doubts, exclaims to Desdemona, `let me see your eyes!' Alas! that he did not credit their truthful expression. Fear, too,' is strongly evinced by the same wondrous organs. In the awful hints the Ghost gives Hamlet of `that undiscoved country,' among the effects prophecied from a more full revelation, is to make his `eyes like stars start from their spheres.' In some eyes, the bard bids us behold `a lurking devil,' in others `love's richest book,'—in the poet's `a fine frenzy;' and, be it remembered, it was upon the eyes that that Puck was ordered to squeeze the little purple flower. Perdita with her fine imagination, could find no better similitude for `violets dim' than `the lids of Juno's eyes.' Prospero exultingly declares, when Ferdinand and Miranda meet, `at the first glance, they have changed eyes.' Hear Olivia in Twelfth Night: Methinks I feel this youth's perfections With an invisible and subtle stealth, To creep in at mine eyes. What poet has presented such an image of the closed eyes of beauty as that contained in Iachimo's soliloquy over the sleeping Imogen?— `the flame o' the taper Bows towards her, and would underpeep her lids To see th' enclosed lights now canopied With blue of Heaven's own tinet.' The prominent part this miraculous little globe performs in love, is indicated by Romeo in Capulet's garden; `She speaks, yet she says nothing; what of that? Her eye discourses, I will answer it.' And when Juliet warns him of her kinsman's designs, he ardently exclaims,— `Alack! there lies more peril in thine eye, Than twenty of their swords; look thou but sweet, And I am proof against their enmity.' 32* The fair object of his passion, as if to reciprocate the sentiment, upon the idea of his death, cries out.— `To prison eyes! ne'er look on liberty!' Wolsey anticipated his downfall from the glance of King Henry;—“ruin leaped from his eyes.” Faulcon-bridge, as the favors of fortune depart from King John, bids him Let not the world see fear and sad distrust Govern the motions of a kingly eye. Biron, in Love's Labors Lost, in balancing the advantages of book-lore and eye-language, declares— From women's eye this doctrine I derive: They are the ground, the books, the academies, From whence doth spring the true Promethean fire. For where is any author in the world, Teaches such beauty as a woman's eye? How finely is the moral expression of the eye suggested by the Friar who advocates the innocence of Hero;— —`in her eye there hath appeared a fire, To burn the errors that these princes hold Against her maiden truth. Bassanio augurs his success with Portia because, he says Sometimes from her eyes I did receive fair, speechless messages. And even the incorrigible Benedick says to Beatrice— “I will be buried in thy eyes.” Phœbe declares of Rosalind— `faster than his tongue Did make offence, his eye did heal it up.' In discussing the beauty of the ancient Greeks, Shelley suggests that the eyes of the women of that nation, on account of their social degradation, `could not have been deep and intricate from the workings of the mind.' Eye-language is, indeed, no light test of cultivation; of native disposition it is a most authentic reporter. Hunt, in describing the hero of Rimini, alludes with singular beauty, to the `easy dignity there lies In the frank lifting of his cordial eyes.' Who has not realized the power of Byron's simile— `like the light of a dark eye in woman?' Falstaff vaunts of Page's wife `sometimes the beam of her view gilded my foot, sometimes my portly belly.' Uncle Toby's dangerous experiment in the sentry-box is well-known; and what a holy guidance Petrarch found in the eyes of Laura! Gentil mia donna, io veggio Nel mover de 'vostri occhi un dolce lume Che mi mostra la via che al ciel conduce. An old dramatist has this conceit;— A smile shoots graceful upward from her eyes, As if they had gained a victory o'er grief; And with it many beams twisted themselves, Upon whose golden threads the angels walk To and again from heaven. Eye-language in its sweetest manifestations, is unfortunately liable to change, like every thing delightful upon this earth. Touching this, a bacheloric essayist of some note, thus reasoneth:—`Ask the married man who has been so but a short time, if those blue eyes, where, during many years of anxious courtship, truth, sweetness, serenity seemed to be written in characters which could not be misunderstood, ask him if the characters they now convey, be exactly the same? if for truth, he does not read a dull virtue (the mimic of constancy) which changes not only because it wants the judgment to make a preference? if for sweetness, he does not read a stupid habit of being pleased at everything, if for sincerity he does not read animal tranquillity, the dead pool of the heart, which no breeze of passion can stir into health.' According to Burke, clearness has much to do with the beauty of the eye, and a languid movement of the organ is most fascinating. Thus Venus is represented with drooping lids. It is observable that while intense thought is indictated by a fixed gaze, pleasurable emotions, especially of a quiet kind, induce the lids to fall somewhat, while the orb gently rolls. A naturalist once gave me a most vivid description of a species of eagle common in the West, the vibration of whose eye corresponded precisely with that of the second hand of an old-fashioned clock. Whoever has attentively watched the progress of a bust under the hand of the modeller, must have realized the importance of shape in giving its peculiar character to the eye. Indeed, the skill of an artist may be estimated, in no small degree, by his success in this regard. Inferior sculptors generally fail in representing nice distinctions in the form of the individual eye, which once caught, gives it even in the cold and colorless marble, a life-like appearance. Richly expressive as is the human eye, the depths and gradations of its language are not to be lightly scanned. Men of the most profound sentiment not unfrequently wear an aspect of indifference, because common life awakens not their spirits. We are often startled by the eye-language of such persons, from the intensity with which it breaks from the dimness of habitual reserve. I remember two nobly endowed individuals—devoted to very different pursuits—whose eyes are seldom lifted from the downward gaze of meditation. I have often remarked the effect upon their whole aspect, when, under the excitement of a happy thought, they raise their eyes from their veiled abodes. The sudden rising of a smiling star in a monotonous sky, or the quick gleaming of a sunbeam athwart a dim landscape, could not be more electrical. We are told of Coleridge, that in moments of intense abstraction, his eyes were so void of language as to appear almost senseless; yet in an expressive mood they were proverbially eloquent. And it is said of Schiller, “his deportment, his gait, the mould of his limbs, his least motion was dignified and grand, only his eyes were soft.” Whoever remarked the eye of Spurzheim when he spoke of `the little beings,'—children, must have realized the mildness and warmth of his benevolence. I can never forget the conception of the power of eye-language which dawned upon me, on seeing an Italian vocalist, at the very climax of an opera, suffer the melody to die away, and look the intense feeling of the moment so effectively as to visibly impress the silent multitude. Having heard much of the eye-language of an accomplished lady, I was several times at great pains to observe, but was invariably unsuccessful. The conversation in each instance, had been of a general nature, which helped to reconcile me to the disappointment. Being soon after possessed of some circumstances of the lady's history which gave me a clue to her inward experience, I managed on the next opportunity to strike the `electric chain,' and draw her into a brief but touching narration. The gradual increase of expression and eventual melting gaze induced by the excitement, was more moving than any pathos of mere words or circumstance that I ever knew. The comparative dearth of eye-language in this country is lamentably significant of the narrow sway of the Ideal, and the rarity of fresh and spontaneous self-development. Exceptions, many and brilliant, there doubtless are;—but the traveller who has been wont to note the eloquent activity and profundity of expression of the eye in most of the continental countries, will feel, as he wanders about the new world, a difference, not to say a deficiency, in this respect. The guarded expression, the waving, the indifferent or at best merely brisk tenor of eye-language among the busy men around him, cannot escape his notice. And when from beneath a fair brow, or in the glance of an enthusiast, the mystic organ speaks with unwonted freedom and effect, he feels revived as by a fondly-remembered tune. Beautiful are the workings of the mystic and microscopic machine. The flowers and the stars speak a moving language; but from the eye beams what will endure when fragrance and light are no more. The curious characters of written language—barren words treasured up by lexicographers, and arbitrarily decreed—the lovelier hieroglyphics which bespangle the sky, or deck the fields,—what are they compared with the more subtle signs which beam in the visual organs—the breathings of the soul, in that “Bright ball on which the spirit sate “Through life, and looked out in its various moods Of gentleness and joy and love and hope, And gained this frail flesh credit in the world.” ART AND ARTISTS. I was struck, recently, with an unfinished sketch by a young artist, who has since lost his reason from the intense activity of a rarely-gifted, but ill-balanced mind. It struck me as an eloquent symbol of his inward experience—a touching comment upon his unhappy fate. He called the design `an artist's dream. It represented the studio of a painter. An easel, a pallet, a port-folio, and other insignia of the art, are scattered with professional negligence, about the room. At a table sits the youthful painter, his head resting heavily on his arm, buried in sleep. From the opposite side of the canvass the shadowy outlines of a long procession seemed winding along, the figures growing more distinct as they recede. In the front rank and with more defined countenances, walk the most renowned of the old masters, and pressing hard upon their steps, the humbler members of that noble brotherhood. It was a mere sketch—unfinished, but dimly mapped out, like the career of its author, yet full of promise, and indicative of invention. It revealed, too, the dreams of fame that were agitating that young heart; and proved that his spirit was with the honored leaders of the art. This sketch is a symbol of the life of a true artist. Upon his fancy throng the images of those whose names are immortal. It is his day-dream to emulate the great departed—to bless his race—to do justice to himself. The early difficulties of their career, and the excitement of their experience, give to the lives of artists a singular interest. West's first expedient to obtain a brush—Barry's proud poverty, Fuseli's vigils over Dante and Milton; Reynolds, the centre of a gifted society; the `devout quiet' of Flaxman's home, and similar memories, crowd upon the mind, intent upon their works. Existence, with them is a long dream. I have ever honored the fraternity, and loved their society, and musing upon the province they occupy in the business of the world, I seem to recognize a new thread of beauty interlacing the mystic tissue of life. In speaking of the true artist, I allude rather to his principles of action, than to his absolute power of execution. Mediocrity, indeed, is sufficiently undesirable in every pursuit, and is least endurable, perhaps, in those with which we naturally associate the highest ideas of excellence. But when we look upon artists as a class— when we attempt to estimate their influence as a profession, our attention is rather drawn to the tendency of their pursuit, and to the general characteristics of its votaries. “Man!” says Carlyle, “it is not thy works which are all mortal, infinitely little, and the greatest no greater than the least, but only the spirit thou workest in, that can have worth or continuance.” In this point of view, the artist, who has adopted his vocation from a native impulse, 33 who is a sincere worshipper of the beautiful and the picturesque, exerts an insensible, but not less real influence upon society, although he may not rank among the highest, or float on the stream of popularity. Let this console the neglected artist. Let this thought comfort him, possessed of one talent—if the spirit he worketh in is true, he shall not work in vain. Upon some mind his converse will ingraft the elements of taste. In some heart will his lonely devotion to an innocent but unprofitable object, awaken sympathy. In his very isolation—in the solitude of his undistinguished and unpampered lot, shall he preach a silent homily to the mere devotee of gain, and hallow to the eye of many a philanthropist, the scenes of bustling and heartless traffic. I often muse upon the life of the true artist, until it redeems to my mind the more prosaic aspects of human existence. It is deeply interesting to note this class of men in Italy. There they breathe a congenial atmosphere. Often subsisting upon the merest pittance, indulging in every vagary of costume, they wander over the land, and yield themselves freely to the spirit of adventure, and the luxury of art. They are encountered with their portfolios, in the midst of the lone campagna, beside the desolate ruin, before the masterpieces of the gallery, and in the Cathedral-chapel. They roam the streets of those old and picturesque cities at night, congregate at the caffé, and sing cheerfully in their studios. They seem a privileged class, and manage, despite their frequent poverty, to appropriate all the delights of Italy. They take long tours on foot, in search of the picturesque; engage in warm discussions together, on questions of art, and lay ever town they visit, under contribution for some little romance It is a rare pastime to listen to the love-tales and will speculations of these gay wanderers. The ardent your from the Rhine, the pensioner from Madrid, and the mercurial Parisian, smoke their pipes in concert, and wrangle good-humoredly over national peculiarities, as they copy in the palaces. Thorwaldsen is wont to call his birth-day the day on which he entered Rome. And when we consider to what a new existence that epoch introduces the artist, the expression is scarcely metaphorical. It is the dawning of a fresher and a richer life, the day that make him acquainted with the wonders of the Vatican, the palace halls lined with the trophies of his profession, the daily walk on the Pincian, the solemn loneliness of the surrounding fields, the beautiful ruins, the long, dreamy day and all the poetry of life at Rome. Whoever has frequently encountered Thorwaldsen in the crowded saloon or visited him on a Sabbath morning, must have read it his bland countenance and benignant smile, the record of his long and plesant sojourn in the Eternal city. To him it has been a theatre of triumph and benevolence. Everywhere in Italy are seen the enthusiastic pilgrims of art, who have roamed thither from every part of the globe. Each has his tale of self denial, and his vision of fame. At the shrine of Art they kneel together. Year by year they collect, in the shape of sketches and copies, the cherished memorials of their visit. A few linger on, until habit makes the country almost necessary to their existence, and they establish themselves in Florence or Rome. Those whom necessity obliges to depart, tear themselves, full of tearful regret, from the genial clime. Many who come to labor, content themselves with admiring, and glide into dreamy habits from which want, alone, can rouse them. Others become the most devoted students, and toil with unremitting energy. A French lady, attached to the Bourbon interest, has long dwelt in Italy, intent upon a monument to Charles X. Her talents for sculpture are of a high order, and her enthusiasm for royalty, extreme. Her hair is cut short like that of a man, and she wears a dark robe, similar to that with which Portia appears on the stage. Instances of a like self-devotion to a favorite project in art, are very common among those who are voluntary exiles in that fair land. One reason why the most famous portraits of the old masters, such as the Fornarina of Raphael and La Bella of Titian, are so life-like and inspire so deep a sense of their authenticity, is doubtless that the originals were objects of affection and familiar by constant association and sympathy, to the minds of the artists. This idea is unfolded in one of Webster's plays, where the advantage of a portrait taken without a formal sitting, is displayed with much quaintness and beauty:— “Must you have my picture? You will enjoin me to a strange punishment. With what a compell'd force a woman sits While she is drawing! I have noted divers Either to feign a smile, or suck in their lips, To have a little mouth; ruffle the cheeks To have the dimples seen; and so disorder The face with affectation, at next sitting It has not been the same: I have known others Have lost the entire fashion of their face In half an hour's sitting,—in hot weather, The painting on their face has been so mellow, They have left the poor man harder work by half To mend the copy he wrought by: but, indeed, If ever I should have mine drawn to the life, I would have a painter steal at such a time I were devoutly kneeling at my prayers; There is then a heavenly beauty in't, the soul Moves in the superfices.” Though the mere tyros in the field of letters and of art, those who pursue these liberal aims without either the genius that hallows, or the disinterestedness that redeems them, are not worthy of encouragement—let respect await the artist whose life and conversation multiply the best fruits of his profession—whose precept and example are effective, although nature may have endowed him with but a limited practical skill. There is a vast difference between a mere pretender and one whose ability is actual but confined. A man with the soul of an artist, is a valueable member of society, although his eye for color may be imperfect, or his drawing occasionally careless. There is, in truth, no more touching spectacle, than is presented by a human being whose emotions are vivid, but whose expression is fettered; in whose mind is the conception which his hand struggles in vain to embody, or his lips to utter. It is a contest between matter and spirit, which angels might pity. It is this very struggle, on a broad scale, which it is the great purpose of all art and all literature to relieve. “It is in me, and it shall come out,” said Sheridan, after his first failure as an orator. And the 33* trial of Warren Hastings brought it out. If we could analize the pleasure derived from the poet and painter, I suppose it would partake much of the character of relief. A great tragedy unburdens the heart. In fancy we pour forth the love, and partake of the sacrifice. And so art gratifies the imagination by reflecting its pictures. The lovely landscape, the faithful portrait, the good historical composition, repeat, with more or less authenticity, the story that fancy and memory have long held in a less defined shape. The rude figures on old tapestry, the miniature illustrations of ancient missals, the arabesques that decorate the walls of the Alhambra, are so many early efforts to the same end. The inventive designer, the gifted sculptor, the exquisite vocalist, are ministers of humanity, ordained by Heaven. The very attempt to fulfil such high service, so it be made in all truthfulness, is worthy of honor. And where it is partially fulfilled, there is occasion for gratitude. Hence I cannot but regard the worthy members of such professions with peculiar interest. They have stepped aside from the common thoroughfare, to cultivate the flowers by the wayside. They have left the great loom of common industry, to weave “such stuff as dreams are made of.” Their office is to keep alive in human hearts, a sense of the grand in combination, the symmetrical in form, the beautiful in color, the touching in sound, the interesting in aspect of all outward things. They illustrate even to the senses, that truth which is so often forgotten—that man does not live by bread alone. As the sunlight is gorgeously reflected by the clouds, they tint even the tearful gloom of mortal destiny with the warm hues of beauty. Artists instruct and refine the senses. With images of grace—with smiles of tenderness—with figures of noble proportions—with tones of celestial melody, they teach the careless heart to distinguish and rejoice in the richest attractions of the world. He who has pondered over the landscapes of Salvator, will thenceforth pierce the tangled woodlands with a keener glance, and mark a ship's hulk upon the stocks, with unwonted interest. John of Bologna's Mercury, will reveal to him the poetry of motion, and the Niobe or the statue of Lorenzo, in the Medici Chapel, make him aware how greatly mere attitude can express the eloquence of grief. The vocalism of a prima donna, will unveil the poetical labyrinths of sound. Claude will make him sensible of masses of golden haze before unobserved, and long scintillations of sunlight, gleaming across the western sky. The neck and hair of woman will be better appreciated after studying Guido; and the characteristic in physiognomy become more striking from familiarity with the portraits of Vandyke. Hogarth, in the humble walk he adopted, not only successfully satirized the vices and follies of London, but gave the common people no small insight into the humorous scenes of their sphere, and Gainsborough attracted attention to many a feature of rustic beauty. Pasta, Catalani and Malibran, have opened a new world in music to countless souls, and Mrs. Wood has produced an era in the musical taste of our land. The artist thus instructs our vision and hearing. But his teachings end not here. From his portraitures of martyrdoms, of the heroic in human history, of the beautiful in human destiny, whether pencilled or sung, he breathes into the soul new self-respect, and moral refinement. We look at the Magdalene prostrate upon the earth, pressing back the luxuriant hair from her lovely temples, her melancholy eyes bent downward, and the lesson of repentance, the blessedness of `loving much,' sinks at once into the heart. We muse upon Raphael's Holy Family, and realize anew the sanctity of maternal love. We commune with the long, silent line of portraits—the gifted and the powerful of the earth, and read, at a glance, the most stirring chronicles of war and genius, of effort and suffering, of glory and death. We drink in the tender harmony of Bellini, and the fountains of sentiment are renewed. The golden age of Art and Artists, the splendid era that dawned early in the fifteenth century is one of the most romantic episodes in human history. The magnificent scale of princely patronage, the brilliant succession of unsurpassed productions, and the trials and triumphs of artists that signalize that epoch, place it in the very sunlight of poetry. There is something in the long lives of those eminent men toiling to illustrate the annals of faith, pursuing the beautiful, under the banner of religion, that gives an air of primeval happiness to human toil, and robs the original curse of its bitterness. The lives of the old masters partake of the ideal character of their creations. Scarcely one of their biographies is devoid of adventurous interest or pathetic incident. Can we not discover in the tone of their works, somewhat of their experience and character? As the poet's effusions are often unintentionally tinged with his moral peculiarities, is there not a certain identity of spirit between the old artists an their works? Leonardo supped with peasants and related humorous stories to make them laugh, that he might study the expression of rustic delight; by writing, conversation, and personal instruction, promoted that most important revolution, the reconciliation of nicety of finish with nobleness of design and unity of color, and having thus prepared the way for a higher and more perfect school of art, expired in the embrace of a king. The though of his efforts as a reformer, and the precursor of the great prophets of art, imparts a grateful sentiment to the mind of the spectator who dwells upon his Nun in the Pitti-palace the Herodias of the Tribune, and the Last Supper at Milan. In the variety of expression displayed in the various head and attitudes of this last work, we recognize the effect of Leonardo's studies from nature. It is singular that the chief monument to his fame, should of all his works, have me with the greatest vicissitudes. The feet were cut off to enlarge the refectory, upon the walls of which it is painted and a door has been made through the finest part. It is with a melancholy feeling, that the traveller gazes upon its dim and corroded hues, and vainly strives to trace the clear outline of a work made familiar by so many engravings. From Leonardo's precision of ideas, the strictness of taste that marked his personal habits, and his attachment to principles of art, something even of the mathematician is recognized in his works. It might be argued from his pictures, that he was no sloven and was fond of rules. Titian's long career of triumph and prosperity, was cheerful and rich as the hues of his canvass, dream-like as his own Venice; his fair and bright-haired mistress, his honors and wealth, contrasting strangely with a death amid pestilence and desertion, come over the memory like a vivid picture. In infancy, Titian colored a print of the Virgin with the juice of flowers, in a masterly manner. In early youth he deserted his teachers for the higher school nature opened to him. The passers uncovered to his portrait of Paul III., as it rested on a terrace at Rome, deeming it alive; and when Charles V. of Spain sat to him for the last portrait, he exclaimed, “This is the third time I have been made immortal!” These exuberant tokens of contemporary appreciation—these, and countless other indications of a life of success and enjoyment, seem woven into the fleshy tints of his Venus, and laugh out in the bright faces of Flora and La Bella. And Correggio's sad story! His lowly toil as a potter, the electric joy with which the conviction came home to him, that he, too, was a painter;—his lonely struggle with obscure poverty;—his almost utter want of appreciation and sympathy;—the limits of a narrow lot pressing upon so fine a soul, and then his rare achievements and bitter death,— worn down by the weight of very lucre his genius had gained,—can fancy, in her widest range, depict a more affecting picture of the “highest in man's heart struggling vainly against the lowest in man's destiny?” His Magdalene, bowed down, yet serene, sad, yet beautiful, sinful yet forgiven, is an emblem as lovely as it is true, of the genius and fate of Correggio. Salvator Rosa has written the history of his own life in those wild landscapes he loved so well. One might have inferred his Neapolitan origin. There is that in his pictures that breathes of southern fancy. We there feel not the chastened tone a Tuscan mind, not the religious solemnity of a Roman, but rather the half-savage genius of that singular region where the lazzaroni sleep on the strand and the fisherman grow swarthy beneath the warmest sky of Italy. The wanderer, the lover of masquerade, he who mingled in the revolt of Massaniello, and roamed amid the gloomy grandeur of the mountains, speaks to us from the canvass of Salvator. Delicacy and affection, taste and sentiment characterize Raphael's paintings. There is in them that refinement of tone, born only of delicate natures, such as this rude world often jars into the insanity of an Ophelia or bows to the early tomb of a Kirk White. Murillo's style has been characterized as between the Flemish and high Italian, and we are told that, as a man, he combines rare simplicity of manners with the greatest elevation and modesty of soul. Michael Angelo has traced the inflexibility of his soul in the bust of Brutus, his self-possessed virtue in the calm grandeur of his muscular figures. One dreams over them of stern integrity and noble self-dependence. It is common to talk of the genius of artists as partaking of the “fine frenzy” attributed to that of the poet. The intense excitement which accompanies the process of conception, is, however, comparatively rare, with the votaries of art. They have this advantage over the great thinker and the earnest bard—that, much of their labor is mechanical, and calls rather for the exercise of taste than mental effort. There is, indeed, a period in every work when imagination is greatly excited and the whole mind fervidly active, but the painter and sculptor have many intervals of repose, when physical dexterity and imitative skill are alone requisite. And when the hand of the artist has acquired that habitual power which makes it ever obedient to the will, when he is perfectly master of the whole machinery of his art, and is confident of realizing, to a great degree, his every conception, a delightful serenity takes possession of his soul. Calm trust in his own resources, and the daily happiness of watching the growth of his work, induce a placid and hopeful mood. And when his aim is exalted and his success progressive, there are few happier men. They have an object, the interest of which familiarity cannot lesson nor time dissipate. They follow an occupation delightful and serene. The atmosphere of their vocation is above the “smoke and stir of this dim spot that men call earth.” The graceful, the vivid, and the delicate elements of their art, refine their sensibilities and elevate their views. Nature and life minister to them more richly than to those who only “poke about for pence.” Hence, methinks, the masters of the art have generally been remarkable for longevity. Their tranquil occupation, the happy exercise of their faculties was favorable to life. It has been said of Michael Angelo's pupils, that they were “nursed in the lap of grandeur.” And it may be said of all true artists, that they are buoyed up by that spirit of beauty that is so essential to true happiness. I have ever found in genuine artists, a remarkable simplicity and truthfulness of character. There is a repose about them as of men who commune with something superior, and for whom the frivolous idols of the multitude have no attraction. I have found them usually fond of music and if not addicted to general literature, ardently attached to a particular poet. They read so constantly the book of nature, that written lore is not so requisite for them. The human face, the waving bough, the flower and the cloud, the fantastic play of the smouldering embers, moonlight on a cornice, and the vast imagery of dreams, are full of teachings for them. There is a definiteness in the art of sculpture, that renders its language more direct and immediate than that of painting. Masses of stone were revered as idols, in remote antiquity; and men soon learned to hew them into rude figures. When architecture, the elder sister of sculpture, had given birth to temples of religion, the statues of deities were their chief ornaments. Images of domestic gods existed as early as the twenty-third century before the Christian era. The early Indian and Hindoo idols, as well as the gloomy sculpture of the Egyptians, evidence how naturally the art sprung from the human mind, even before a refined taste had developed its real dignity. Sculpture was a great element of Grecian culture. In the age of Pericles, it attained perfection. In the square and the temple, on the hill-top and within the private dwelling, the beautiful productions of the chisel met the eye. They addressed every sentiment of devotion and patriotism. They filled the soul with ideals of symmetry and grace, and the traces of their silent eloquence were written in the noble air, the harmonious 34 costume and the very forms of the ancient Greeks. The era of ideal models and a classic style passed away. In the thirteenth century, the art revived in Italy, and there are preserved some of the noblest specimens of Grecian genius, as well as those to which M. Angelo and his countrymen gave birth. The Apollo looks out upon the sky of Rome, while the Venus “loves in stone” and Niobe bends over her clinging babe in the Florence gallery. Shelley used to say, that he would value a peasant's criticism upon sculpture, as much as that of the most educated man. Form is, indeed, more easily judged than color. There is a certain vagueness in painting, while sculpture is palpable, bold and clear. There is a severe nobility in the art; its influence is to calm and elevate rather than excite. The Laocoon, Niobe and Allesandro doloroso are indeed expressions of passion; but they are striking exceptions. Sculpture soothes the impetuous soul. The heads of the honored dead wear a solemn dignity. The stainless and cold marble breathes a pure repose, stamped with the calm of immortality. In walking through the Vatican by torch-light, we might deem ourselves, without much exercise of fancy, in a world of spirits. The tall white figures stretching forward in the gloom, the snowy faces, upon which the flambeaux glare, the winding drapery and the outstretched arm, strike the eye in that artificial light, with a startling look of life. One feels like an intruder into some hall of death, or conclave of the great departed. A good bust is an invaluable memorial; it preserves the features and expressions without their temporary hue. There is associated with it the idea of durability and exactitude. Though the most common offspring of sculpture, it is one of the rarest in perfection. Few sculptors can copy nature so faithfully as to give us the very lineaments wholly free from caricature or embellishment. Those who have an eye for the detail of expression, often fail in general effect. To copy the form of the eye, the texture of the hair, every delicate line of the mouth, and yet preserve throughout an air of veri similitude and that unity of effect which always exists in nature, is no ordinary achievement. The requisite talent must be a native endowment; no mechanical dexterity can ever reach it. “A thing of beauty is a joy for ever.” This sentiment spontaneously fills the heart in view of the great products of the chisel. We contemplate the Niobe and Apollo, as millions have before us, with growing delight and the most intense admiration. They have come down to us from departed ages, like messengers of love; they assure us, with touching eloquence, that human genius and affection, the aspirations and wants, the sorrow and the enthusiasm of the soul, were ever the same; they invoke us to endure bravely and to cherish the beautiful and true, as our best heritage. So speak they and so will they speak to unborn generations. In the silent poetry of their expressive forms lives a perennial sentiment. They keep perpetual state, and give the world audience, that it may feel the eternity of genius, and the true dignity of man. It is delightful to believe that sculpture is destined to flourish among us. It is truly the art of a young republic. Let it perpetuate the features of our patriots, and people our cities with images of grandeur and beauty. Worthy votaries of the art are not wanting among us: on the banks of the Arno, they speak of Greenough and Powers; from the studios of Rome come praises of Crawford, and beside the Ohio is warmly predicted the fame of Clevenger. Let us cherish such followers of the art with true sympathy and generous patronage. The national heart will not then be wholly corroded by gain, and a few places will be kept green for repose and refreshment, upon the great highway of American life. THE WEATHER. I have just parted with one of those insensible beings who profess perfect independence of the weather,—a class, one would think, by their manner of treating this popular topic, differently organized from the majority of mankind. It is really provoking to remark the complacency with which they declare that the atmospheric vicissitudes affect them not, that they are too busy to note the course of the wind, and that half the time they know not whether it rains or shines; as if it were a fit subject for congratulation—this unnatural insusceptibility to what human beings should, from their very constitution, consciously feel. Much pleasure do these weather-despisers lose. It is true, they suffer not the throe; but, be it remembered, they enjoy not the thrill. Welcome are they to their much vaunted indifference to the state of the elements. Better, methinks, to suffer somewhat, and even fancifully, from the weather, than to be wrapped up in a mantle of unconcern—to walk forth regardless of the temperature, and without any more interest in the existent face of the heavens, than if they were changeless and 34* stony, like the mood of such spirits. This independence `argues an insensibility.' A hopeful token, in truth, is a just susceptibility to the weather. There is reason in its universality, as a subject of discussion; there is a real benefit in being alive to its influences. Dr. Johnson indeed, with characteristic hardihood, boasted of his immunity from `skyey influences;' but Milton confesses that his poetical vein flowed only between the autumnal and vernal equinox. Thomson declared his muse was most docile in the fall; and Byron always felt most religiously disposed on a sunny day. Hear the stout Ashyre ploughman— `How stan' you this blae eastlin wind, That's like to blaw a body blind? For me my faculties are frozen. In Naples, they have a saying, when any literary production is very bad, that it was written during a sirocco. The air and sky are a common heritage—they greet all the living impartially; and, while the changes of all things else affect only certain classes and individuals, their variations influence us all. It is well that there is thus a theme of universal sympathy, about which men, as such, can exchange opinions. The weather is essentially a republican subject; and of all topics, whereby to get over the awkwardness of a first interview, it is decidedly the most convenient. What idea would answer to begin a colloquy with, had we not the weather? If the elements were as fixed, or as regular in their changes, as the earth, what an available starting point in conversation should we be deprived of! After being introduced to an individual of whom we know nothing, what could we find to talk about, were this elemental theme not ever-present? To speak of literature or music, without knowing the taste of our new acquaintance, might prove a damper; to begin chatting about other people, might betray us into scandalizing the kindred of our auditor; but to allude enthusiastically to the beauty of the evening, or sympathetically to its coldness, would, in all probability, advance us at once far on the pleasant track of sociability. Besides it is altogether so natural and human to talk about the weather—to tell how we feel under its prevailing influence—and to listen, with profound interest, to the details our companion may give as to its effect on him. In this way we glide, with transcendant ease, into a sympathizing vein; glimpses of mutual character are incidentally afforded, and then the way to more familiar communion lies clear and open. Let the conceited non-observers of the weather, who are liable to find themselves at a non-plus in conversation, consider the remarkable adaptativeness of the theme; and for this, if for no better reason, hasten to excite their lukewarm zeal as amateur meteorologists. Weather-wisdom is a consoling acquirement. I have often re-learned the lesson of human equality, in observing the complacency of an honest tar, as he interpreted the signs of the sky to some accomplished veteran in book lore. The poor sailor, only matriculated by some marine witchery on crossing the line for the first time— and who only graduated, after some fierce whaling adventure, from cabin-boy to seaman—thenceforth witless of farther degrees—expounding to the attentive university-man, a chapter of his knowledge in the ways of the wind, with as much zest as his hearer ever cleared up a puzzling passage in the Georgies to a group of wondering striplings. Such a scene, not seldom witnessed by the voyager, evinces what a comfortable device is weather-wisdom. Admitting it is the illusive thing many deem it, what a pleasant peg it affords some people to hang a little self-sustaining pride upon. To those who have not wit enough to comprehend the abstract sciences, —to those who regard the beauties of literature as mysteries, and who can make nothing of political economy— what a ready alternative is weather-wisdom! It requires little sense to keep a journal of the dates of snow storms, or to talk, with seeming sagacity, of the prospects of the season. And what a benevolent provision is this of nature's—that such as are bereft of more recondite lore, can yet nourish self-respect on their notable attainments in weather-wisdom! But these are only secondary evidences of our obligations to the weather; insensibly do its variations gratify our love of novelty. Every day is new—if not from change of circumstances, from change of weather. How tame might not be our feelings, if sameness was a law of the elements! It is no inconsiderable pastime to note, on every successive morning, a new condition of the physical world; and pitiable, we repeat, is he who finds no refreshment in the shifting scene—to whose eye all aspects of external nature are alike; then, be assured, some deep grief has overshadowed the soul, or some physical infirmity palsied the sense. There is something morbid in those who are insensible to the weather, as well as in such as are nervously alive to its every minute alteration. It is a beautiful indication of humanity to habitually take cognizance of these subtle agencies that surround us—to regard them as ministrants intimately associated with human weal. I once stood amid the ruins of an ancient amphitheatre with a man of deep social sympathies; we spoke of the myriads who once thronged the now silent spot. `We have reason to believe,' said he, `that wherever they are, they are together; what a happy idea, that even a dismal fate may be meliorated by sympathy!' And we that now throng a living temple—would it not be an anomaly if we did not sympathize under the operation of universal laws? There is truth to human nature in Hamlet's allusion to the weather, even when awaiting his father's ghost. Our interest in the weather is not altogether direct. Not alone to our individual senses does it appeal. Human hopes sway in every breeze. Destiny sometimes seems dependent upon the elements. How many anxious beings are noting the wayward winds when their loved ones are upon the waters; how many tearful eyes are directed to the sky when the cherished invalid is exposed to its varying phases. Property and life, success and love, are too often and too nearly associated with the weather, to permit even the hardy and the stern to boast perfect immunity from its influences. And we wonder not that the ancients deified and invoked the agents of such mighty revolutions. Invisibly, and with a scarcely perceptible increase, the new wind arises; but on its unseen wings float—how many human interests! It bears to the worn and watching tidings of the absent, it wafts to the unthinking breast the seeds of a fell disease; it awakens hymns among the light foliage, and refreshes the care-shadowed brow:—odours and music, gladness and grief, life and death, are borne with silence and certainty to their destined ends. And so with the sunlight and the storm, the summer shower and the noontide heat—they have voices many and impressive, and fulfil a thousand noiseless and subtle missions with promptitude. We are told that at one period in the ancient history of medicine, but two kinds of disease were recognized, resulting from the contracted and relaxed state of the pores. Doubtless this system originated in the observation of the effects of atmospheric changes upon the skin. Some individuals feel the weather chiefly through this medium; some are made aware of its variations by the sensations they excite in the region of the lungs or stomach; and to others the temples or thorax are as a perpetual barometer. By the peculiar sensibility of some part of their bodies, all are, in a greater or less degree, physically susceptible to the weather; and through whatever portal the unbidden guest enters, the nervous sense is soon aware of iis presence. And thus, the universal agent, the spirit of the elements, insinuates itself into a higher domain. Our mental moods are, more or less, affected; and when the temperament is poetical, the weather, like all things else, abounds with under-currents of influence and mystic echoes to its common language, of which the multitude are scarcely conscious. The weather is an impressive time-keeper. To many it is the most regulating of dials. Not only does it serve to mark the flight, but to control the appropriation of time. The dreamy mood, induced by a warm, cloudy day, inclines us to visit ruins. The blitheness excited by a cold, clear morning, suggests a rapid promenade. When the night wind sighs dismally, our fancies rove through the world of dark romance. A winter twilight makes us realize `how transitory are human flowers;' and the same season in mid summer, quickens the idea of being into a sense of immortality. All the world over, mild and moonlight evenings are sacred to young love. Old Walton wisely invokes a wet evening for the perusal of his discourse; and, `'Tis heaven to lounge upon a couch, said Gray, And read new novels through a rainy day.' The poets from first to last, in things human and scientific, are, after all, the best philosophers. How universally have they taken cognizance of, and chronicled the elements; and how appropriately adapted them to the circumstances of their heroes and heroines. How feelingly they speak of the weather! What obesrvant, particular, and sensitive meteorologists are they all. How graphic is Byron's description of a London daybreak and how sweetly does Mrs. Hemans extol the magic of a sunbeam! What influential, ay, and metaphysical storms, dog-days, and spring mornings, are those immortalized in the annals of every celebrated bard. In truth, poets seem intuitively weather-wise. The weather is eloquently symbolical. It is a perennial fountain of metaphors. The clouds that fly over the star gemmed sky, typify the exhalations of earth which, ever and anon, shade the spirit in its pilgrimage. The wreaths of vapour circling on the gentle breeze, and made rosy and radiant by the sun-light, present an apt similitude of the rise, expansion, and glow of the enthusiast's visions. An icy footpath preaches a homily on mortal instability to the pedestrian, and a deep azure sky is a pure symbol of peace to the gifted eye. The moonlight reposing on snow has been fitly made to illustrate memory; and the dew sparkling in the sun, is a bright emblem of youth, as its vanishing is of decay. Happy the being, whose consciousness is so lost in the blest intensity of the elements within him, as to be unconscious of those around him; for the glow of human enthusiasm is more beautiful than the flush of the most magnificent sunset. But undesirable is the sternness that disdains to recognize the contrasts of the elements; for the aspect of a frozen lake or the touch of a northern blast is far less chilling, than an unsympathizing spirit to a being of worthy sensibility. MANNER. When the fluid particles composing the primeval earth settled into consistent masses, an unbroken, uniform, plain was not the result; but everywhere, form, color and density indicated the various species of matter. Verdure crept over the rich loam, long tables of sand marked the limits of the sea, and rocks of every hue stood forth from the hills. Form of aspect and movement became a law of creation. Even the unstable elements obeyed it. The waters projected themselves into billows, currents, and fountains, and the aeriform waves of the “upper deep” were poured forth in as certain developments. To everything a manner was awarded, by which it was to be recognised, and through which it was to be studied. Another world was then called into being,—a universe of thought, sentiment, fancy, and feeling, a human world. And in this, too, external forms were assumed, and manner became a characteristic of mortals. The same law obtains in the spheres of mind and matter; but how differently displayed! Since the first song of the stars, the heavens have worn the same successive drapery, the earth 35 has changed not her four familiar robes. The winds have raised the billows into mountains or dallied with the rose-leaves. In all things has nature been variable, yet the same—ever presenting a well-known though ever varying feature. She knows not the law of fashion. She is inexpert in artificial diplomacy. But manner, among human beings, is subject to the modifications of time and place; it can be made subservient to the will. In its very nature, manner is a means, and greatly do those err who make it an end. Yet are there individuals, by whom this adjunctive, secondary, exponent principle is supremely cultivated and mainly relied on. There are those who manage to glide along through the world by a kind of mannered legerdemain, who have acquired their manner in the ancient school of Proteus, and by their singular dexterity in ever imparting the required impression, from moment to moment, fail not in their social objects. There is a species of shufilers, who succeed, by virtue of an off-hand manner, which mankind, in general, are content to yield to. The most popular class is, doubtless, that which reduces Chesterfield to practice, on principle, and with veritable punctilio. These devotees lean on a broken reed. Their faith in a manner is too perfect. With wonder did I once hear a man of sense console himself for the unprincipled conduct of his son, by declaring that `through all he had kept his manners.' When tact at mere verbal rhyming constitutes a poet, musical memory a composer, or taste in colors a painter, then may we believe that manner will make a man, for, “Heaven never meant him for a passive thing, That can be struck and hammered out to suit Another's taste and fancy.” There is a policy in manner. I have heard one, not inexperienced in the pursuit of fame, give it his earnest support as being the surest passport to absolute and brilliant success. And who, that has been chained, for hours, as by enchantment, with the grace and elegance of an orator, and then, in solitude, reviewed his words and recalled not a single original and impressive idea—has not realised this? It is wonderful how a skilful mannerist can deceive the world as to his acquirements and motives. I have, at this moment, in my mind's eye, the comely figure of an individual who has attained no undesirable elevation in the world of letters, whose manner is so profound and scholar-like, so redolent of the otium cum dignitate, that it has earned him the cognomen of the learned. A Greek name is inscribed upon his cane, and a Latin adage upon his tongue's end. He yields not to familiar discourse, nor manifests an interest in aught save what is classical. In company with scholars, he is silent, seemingly from abstraction; in the society of the uninitiated he speaks much, apparently to relieve the exuberance of his acquisitions: the one class attempt not to examine his pretensions, from a horror (natural to high minds) of pedantic display; the other, awe-struck, yield him reverence. Now a few years since, —; but I will not betray him. Suffice it to say, that the first time the magnificence of his manner is invaded, the commanding frost-work of his reputation will melt in air. We habitually suspect the truthfulness of a prominent manner. If, in the presence of an individual, he induces us to think continually of his manner and forget himself, we are quickly aware of our want of affinity. There is no delight in his fellowship. Of all forbidding inventions, an assumed manner is the most effectual. We instinctively anticipate the forthcoming scene behind our backs. Some masterly delineation of the Duke of Gloster, in the act of hurling away the prayer book, occurs to us. We are ill at ease; we seem to hear the laugh and witness the mimicry which is to occur when the door has closed upon our exit. We discern beyond the smile and the honeyed word, and are sickened at the self created hollowness of a human heart. We have admirable provisions in our civil code, for the crimes of perjury and overreaching. A thrice heavy penalty should fall upon him convicted of deliberately and habitually practising upon mankind, through the agency of a pre-assumed, politic manner. Manner is the universal language, the grand circulating medium; and should not the attempt to counterfeit the genuine, native stamped coin, be made penal? There are no greater forgers in the universe than cunning mannerists. Their whole lives are false. The loveliest of human attributes, the beautiful, the winning virtue of sincerity abides not with them. They have abjured the profession of humanity. They have become players—with none of the ideal interest and singleness of purpose which may belong to the legitimate followers of Thespis. The wearisome rehearsals, the guarded conduct, the oppressive sense of having a part to play, the struggles between the real man and the assumed character— all press upon and disturb them; and there is for them no refreshing returns to nature, no blissful interludes in the trying drama, for habit has bound them to the task, and policy goads them on. There is a poignancy in manner. I have often heard a friend describe the effect produced at a well-surrounded dinner table, by the silence of a gentleman to whom one of the company, in a very audible voice, had addressed an impertinent question. The tacit rebuke was most keenly felt; it was more effectual than a public reprimand, and yet how entirely devoid of irrational severity. Similar results may be effected through expert application of manner. An instance occurs among the innumerable anecdotes related of John Randolph. A young aspirant for congressional fame saw fit, in his maiden speech, to give proof of his boldness and eloquence, by a long and abusive attack upon the eccentric member from Virginia. At the conclusion of the young orator's voluminous address, the hero of Roanoke arose, and stretching his long, nervous arm toward the seat of the complacent youth, with a half-enquiring, half-contemptuous look, thus replied:—“Mr. Speaker, who's that?” There was a sarcastic bitterness in his manner, under which the offender quailed. I was never more impressed with the poignant sting mere manner can inflict, than on one occasion, when abroad. Soon after day-break, on a misty morning, the steam-boat which had brought us from Naples, dropped anchor in the port of Leghorn. We waited, with great impatience, the arrival of the permit to land, from the board of health. At length, understanding it had been received, I joined a party 35* of the pasengers and entered one of the boats which surrounded us. We were distant from the shore about an eighth of a mile. The wind was blowing a gale and the sea running very high. We had reached about the middle of the intervening space, and were beginning to rejoice at the prospect of a comfortable shelter, when the health-officer, from the steam-vessel, hailed our boatman, ordering him, upon his peril, not to proceed. It seemed some form had been omitted; and, we were kept in the rain, and among the dashing billows, for more than half an hour. Thoroughly vexed at the officer's conduct, we began at last to approach the quay, cold, wet, and comfortless. Various measures were suggested for bringing him to punishment. An Englishman begged that we would leave it to him, assuring us he was well acquainted with the temperament of the people. Soon after, the official barge approached, and in the prow sat our enemy with that air of superiority characteristic of underlings. With much curiosity we awaited the movements of our British companion. To our astonishment he doffed his hat, and said—addressing the officer—“Your name, sir, if you please.” The rowers of the barge slackened their oars and gazed curiously upon their commander; his face was suffused with scarlet—“My name! my name!” he muttered fiercely, and impatiently waving to the oarsmen, they soon shot rapidly away. We looked to the English gentleman for an explanation. “Gentlemen” said he, “be assured I have wounded him to the quick; if I had parleyed with him, his pride would have been gratified; but by asking, in a ceremonious manner, for his name, in the presence of his men, as if we disdained to do less than complain to his superior, I have both mortified and alarmed him. The formality of my manner has punished him more than words could possibly do.” And so proved. For, on landing, we found him pacing the wharf and uttering his indignation and fears most violently while ample apologies were proffered us from all quarters. I afterwards discovered that to bandy words with the lower classes of Italy, was but to waste one's breath and subject the patience to a great trial;—to meet them on their own ground and give them the advantage which the fluency of their language affords. They must be addressed the language of manner, to which they are peculiarly susceptible. There is a power in manner. How finely Byron describes, in the bearing of Conrad— “that commanding art That dazzles, leads, yet chills the vulgar heart.” Who that is susceptible to nature, will deny that the sway of manner consists in its truth? We speak of the impressive dignity of some of the Indian tribes; kings might strive to imitate it in vain. It is the gift of nature— the ennobling grace of the forest lords. The companionship of genius—when do we most perfectly realise it? What enthusiasm has led the gifted mind into such an outpouring that manner is forgotten, and every look and movement is instinct with soul. In aged persons and children—those who have lived too long to meditate effect, and those who, as yet, listen only to the inward oracle, we more frequently see the perfect spell of manner. What a world of allurement is involved in the common phrase, an unaffected manner! Nothing is so delightful as what is spontaneous. A frank expression of sentiment, a native manner, captivate; thrice happy when the latter is habitual. Memnon's image imparted not its mysterious strains except at the touch of the sunbeams, nor will manner yield its true witchery from any inspiration but that of the soul. PET-NOTIONS. Our loving tendencies, like Bob Acres' valor, sometime ooze out, if not from the finger ends, yet in forms the most various and fantastic imaginable. All of us have our little oddities, minor loves and minor interests, objects trifling, and perhaps ridiculous in themselves, and yet were we at strict confessional, perchance, it would appear that these pet-notions are as much heart-binders as mightier things. For my part, I see nothing to be ashamed of in the minute eccentricities of our wayward hearts, restless minds, or fanciful idealities. I love to see human nature vindicate itself, however quaintly. It is a proof of the ethereal essence of the soul that when a man is entombed between four bare walls, he will, like poor Trenck, cherish amity with a dungeon mouse, or love, like Pellico, of prison memory, to minister to the pleasure of a spider. Pet-notions, like every other species of the immense family of notions, are highly reprehensible in their excess. When instead of serving their appropriate office of nooks for the play of our little amiable humors, they are made the sole fields for the free bounding affections to revel in, then are pet-notions rendered stocks wherein to cramp and pervert humanity. I would fain believe that this is less the case than formerly. Here and there only in the wide world, I ween, may the woman now be found whose love has yielded up its sanctity, and become concentrated in a poodle-dog or a parrot. The pet-notions of our day, I take to be legitimate, and not seldom interesting. They are what they should be, tiny curious leaves, peeping out comically from among the more umbrageous foliage of our love-bowers. Few things minister more generally and appropriately to the pet passions than flowers. Beautiful provision does Flora make for our little loves. I marvel not that many are touched with an universal affection for the entire contents of the goddess's cornucopia; and, like Horace Smith, merge in attachment to the delightful family their partiality for an individual member, and exclaim, with that fond bard, “Floral apostles! that in dewy splendor Weep without wo, and blush without a crime! O may I deeply learn and ne'er surrender Your lore sublime!” But it is essential to a pet-passion that its objects should be petty and single, minute, and, as far as may be, unique. Accordingly those who love flowers at all, generally love, with especial affection, a particular species. Could the truth be known, I think the above-named Horace is partial to some bell-flower, he speaks so touchingly of the “Floral bell that swingeth And tolls its perfume on the passing air.” But however that may be, it is an obvious fact that pet-flowers are remarkably common. Witness the tributary stanzas of the standard poets; and observe how individual characteristics are shadowed forth even in pet-notions. Who but poor Burus could have written so lovingly of a mountain daisy? His deep, tender spirit of humanity led him to cherish the wee bit flower as it did to note the young castaway, with a sympathy surpassing what gaudier flowers and more prosperous human beings could inspire. Does not Wordsworth affect primroses because they are so common and grow wild? Mrs. Hemans, methinks, would scarcely have spoken of any but a pet-flower as she has of the water-lily; and of a truth, I know of few similitudes whereby her own sweet self can be better typified. Graceful, lovely, and upward gazing is the lily—and so was the poetess. A friend of mine is passionately fond of pinks. In summer you may know him among a thousand, by one of his little favorites protruding from his button-hole or twirling between his lips. There is an analogy between his pet-flower and himself. He admires neatness, order, and symmetry of arrangement. He suffers if a picture hangs awry, and wherever he is, begs leave to right its position. A smile lights up his countenance whenever a man of well-arranged exterior presents himself. In a word, my friend is `as neat as a pink.' There are those who have so little of their proper humanity remaining, that nature furnishes no little emblems which please them by affinity; so, their pet notions are confined to some trinket of rare materials or peculiar workmanship. There's old Carville—who with much precision of character unites not a little of superstition and technicality—one of that class so admirably described as `endeavoring to atone by microscopic accuracy for imbecility in fundamental principles.' Carville's pet-notion some time ago, was a very small and exquisitely wrought death's head, which he carried in his waiscoat pocket, to remind him, as he said, `of his coming change.' Now he has the key of his tomb hung up above his writing desk for the same purpose. I've heard of a gentleman who carries a phrenological chart on the lid of his snuff-box. This pet-notion ministers highly to his pleasure and advantage, since all his brother mortals are, as soon as seen, brought to trial, as his eye glances from his mull to their craniums. Medals, coins, old china, and autographs, are the pets of many. The pet-notions of others are far more abstract than these; they consist of words or phrases which have become, from long use, inseparably associated with the individual. They may have been first adopted from caprice; but usually we find the person has, or fancies he has, the tact of making them very expressive, or they mean much in his estimation, suit his voice and air, or indicate from his mouth a mystic profundity of knowledge, wit, or sentiment. At all events, they are pet-notions, as you may know from their frequent use, and the aim at effect with which they are uttered. An acquaintance of mine exclaims, `My dear fellow' every five minutes, with an affectionateness which is touching in the extreme. He knows it, and therefore has petted the phrase till now he would as soon part with his own name as discontinue the moving enunciation. A fashionable, conversable lady, whom I have often heard talk, expresses her assent to whatever views are promulgated to her by the term `decidedly,' uttered with an intonation and nod superlatively impressive. It was a decidedly pet-notion of hers to introduce this word continually into her vivacious chattings. I know a poetical dandy who used to accomplish the same object by the phrase `true, true.' The articulation of these words did not cost him much breath, of which tight garments left him little to waste; there was a dignity in their very brevity, and therefore were they complacently adopted into his petty vocabulary. My quondam friend in the city of — was a fine-hearted old Italian bachelor, who had sojourned years by-gone in this country. He spoke tolerable English, except the accent and nasal melody with which the words were connected at long intervals. Now the choice of a phrase for a pet was of no small importance to the good signor. In the first place, it ought to be a priori, of universal applicability, in order to come in whenever his verbal memory should fail—an accident by the way, of no unfrequent occurrence—then it should have a latent wisdom, for my old friend prided himself upon his knowledge of the world, and delivered the most ordinary expressions with an air of oriental gravity; therefore must the phrase be rife with meaning. Whether these considerations led to its selection, whether he gleaned it from learned men of this land, consulted Dr. Johnson, or hit upon it by a happy effort of his own genius, I cannot 36 positively declare; but assuredly never was there a better or more fitting pet-notion furnished foreigner from the bounteous bosom of our blessed vernacular. The first time I heard it from the lips of the signor, I was lost in admiration, and not doubting it was the precursor of some profound discourse, I composed myself to listen with an emotion of thankful expectancy; the second time, I was taken less by surprise, and noted with new delight the gesture, glance, and preparatory ahem; by and by, I became accustomed to it, and never ascended the high winding stairs which led to the old man's apartment, without an indefinite anticipation, or descended them without a lurking lingering sense of my friends pet-notion. I seem even now to hear him. I admired to go thither with novices, to witness the effect. It was astonishing with what facility he introduced the phrase into conversation, no matter what its nature or end. Whether speaking of the latest political intelligence, of the weather, of the opera, of dinner, of time past, present or future; of this or that man, woman or child, of books or beggars, of war or walking, of money or martyrdom;—still, still would he gravely, solemnly, fondly reiterate, `My dear sir, human nature has always been the same.' The natural interest in the principle of life which characterises human beings, influences their pet-notions. We instinctively love animation—the embodying of a living, moving, self-actuating energy. Hence the most generally cherished pet-notions are taken from the animal world. And herein I again recognize a true humanity in these foibles of the affections; if such they may be called. I have found those who make an intimate of some lone member of the feathered tribe, find companionship in one of the canine species, or tenderly care for a steed, generally prove, in the double and best sense of the term, clever fellows. I know much is said of the dearth of domestic attachment, of the folly of bestowing so much care on a brute, &amp;c.; but, when not over-indulged, such pet-notions are usually discoverable in whole-hearted and susceptible beings. I have heard of an eccentric Englishman who petted an oyster many years, feeding it with oat-meal till its size was prodigious. No less cheerful are the little back yards of the French metropolis, because at noon and eve the white-capped housewife provokes the mocking-bird, whose cage hangs under the vine leaves, by her endearing greetings, to echo every note of the woodland. The favored dove that stoops at sunrise to the window, and quaintly turns upward her sparkling eye as she perches on the fair hand which has nourished her; the spaniel who leaps to hail the return of his master, despised old bachelor though he be; the tabby favorite who purs forth her love in the lap of her whose blessedness were otherwise indeed single; the pampered gold fish in their glassy globe, and the froward kid who looks in at the door,—indicate to the reflective observer that the freshness and expansion of humanity have not departed from the dwelling; that love is there, albeit some of its overflowings fall soothingly even upon the soulless brute. It was no small amusement to Shelley, at Oxford, to sail paper-boats. Dr. Johnson used to save orange-peel and feed his cat with oysters. Many a milliner's apprentice cherishes a box of mignonette, and the poorest clerk can afford to keep a geranium in his window—of which the feel of the leaf, says Hunt `has a household warmth in it somewhat analogous to clothing and comfort.' A man in Germany, once collected a large number of ropes with which criminals had been executed; and a monk passed years in attempting to gather all the prints of the Madonna ever issued. Vaucluse was as odd and withal as affectionate as any of the students at the university of —. I have seldom known a more singular pet-notion, or one more fondly petted than was his. He was romantic in the extreme, and the mysterious appearance of his notion coupled with a highly romantic era in its history, which I will relate, combined to deepen the pride and interest with which he cherished his pet. He was gazing thoughtfully from his window, just as the sun beamed brightly upon the sill, when bending his eye thither, from an aperture beneath, he saw a young toad spring out and composedly seat himself in the genial rays. Presently an unfortunate fly sailing languidly by, was snapped at, and devoured in a twinkling, by the speckled intruder, and this act of destructiveness was repeated at intervals, until the shadows darkened the sill, when the toad quietly retreated to his hole. Vaucluse marked this for a white day in his monotonous life. Already his heart yearned toward the independent fly hunter. He found something singularly interesting in his appearance and manners. There was a touch of misanthropy, a grave contempt of the world, a magistrate-like dignity, a solitary quietude and an honest bachelorism about the toad, that chimed in with the student's humor. He determined to adopt and cherish him; and accordingly was at the window, to welcome his pet-notion, as soon as Sol brightened the sill, and joining in the fly hunt, he daily surfeited the stomach of his favorite till he looked, for all the world, like a Dutch alderman. Things were in this state, when Vaucluse was disturbed in the midst of his feeding operations, by the abrupt entrance of the last man he wished to see, under such circumstances. It was no other than Snider, a medical student, noted for his sarcastic drollery, and prematurely, by complaisance, ycleped doctor. The toad-fosterer prepared himself for a wit-battering; but he looked upon the child of his adoption and felt a martyr's courage nerve him. What was his surprise to see his friend assume an expression of sadness as his eye rested on the toad, and then look mournfully in his face. “What's the matter?” he enquired. “Vaucluse,” he replied solemnly, “I'm sorry for you;” and he drew out his handkerchief. “For heaven's sake, explain yourself; this suspense is insupportable.” “Is it possible that a man of your intelligence has suffered himself to be deceived?” “My dear doctor, do, do, I pray you, speak.” “Know then, Vaucluse, that your unwise pampering has induced the incipient symptoms of apoplexy in yon poor toad.” 36* “No; you are not in earnest”— “I am. Mark his distended sides, his gasping breath, his heavy eyes.—Vaucluse, he cannot survive the night, but through the application of immediate medical aid.” “Say not so. Can you, my dear doctor, can you cure him?” “If the case is unconditionally left with me.” “Doctor, I fear to trust you; but there's no remedy. Do what thou wilt, but do it quickly.” “The eye of the young Esculapius brightened; the toad was his first patient. Softly upheaving the sash, he gently lifted the wheezing animal from his warm seat, and raising him as if more nearly to inspect the gustatory organs, he suddenly ejected from his mouth into the open maw of the unfortunate toad, an immense quid of half-consumed cavendish; then replacing him, he awaited only to see him sneeze thrice, with a shudder swallow the pill, and retire to his dark abode; then glancing at the confounded and indignant Vaucluse, he made his exit, murmuring the while—“emetic and cathartic—large dose—operation protracted result—general reduction of the system.” Why need I relate the vigils of a romantic student who vainly watches for the coming of his pet-notion? Suffice it to say that days, weeks, nay a whole month flew by, and the toad greeted not the eyes of Vaucluse. “Hope darkened into anxiety, anxiety into dread, and dread into despair.” The solitary student observed the first monthly anniversary of his pet's departure by unusual moodiness and abstinence. When the sun kissed the white surface of the window sill, he stood with a fixed eye, folded arms and a frowning brow, looking upon its solitude. Did he dream? Something like a toad's head seemed protruding from the hole. He rubbed his eyes; and with what emotions, I leave the reader to imagine, beheld something very like a toad, the outline, the shadow of his corpulent pet, slowly creep forth and drag himself to his old position. The speckled skin hung flabbily, the legs were perfect anatomies; the toad seemed in the last stage of a consumption. In vain his feeble jaws essayed to seize their prey. His eye gleamed brilliantly. Vaucluse tearfully opened the casement, placed the daintiest flies in the open mouth of the convalescent, and ere many days beheld the bright colours revive upon the epidermis, the sides and back plump heartily out, and the fly-hunt proceed more briskly than ever. He once more rejoiced in his pet-notion. LOITERING. Philosophers seldom deem the minor characteristics of their kind worthy of discussion. Otherwise, methinks they would have analysed a feeling of which not a few are conscious; I mean the loitering propensity. Even the poets, who are vastly more circumspect in nothing the quaint things of life, have scarcely alluded to this. Neither Crabbe, indefatigable as he was in taking cognizance of the veriest humors of our nature, nor Wordsworth, bravely as he has persevered in showing up the more simple and native workings of the heart, have done justice to the inherent disposition to loiter which belongs to some men, as truly as their gait or their noses. Let no one suggest that the topic would have been appropriate to Thomson's “Castle of Indolence.” Your legitimate loiterers are the busiest men alive. Depend upon it their air of leisure, though it may indicate the absence of certain domestic inspirers of activity—proves any thing rather than the absence of thought. Why, Addison was wont to loiter in club-rooms, Irving in old English castles, and Charles Lamb at book-stalls. The Spectator, Sketch-Book, and Elia, prove that they did not loiter in vain. Taste and circumstances combine to influence our habits of loitering. The young physician loiters in the druggist's shop, the coxcomb in the street, and the poet by the river's side. Loiterers of some kind and in some degree are we all, superlatively busy and time-saving as we may complacently think ourselves. There is no little philosophy in loitering. The driving creatures who are ceaselessly on the move, brushing by you with a smile of recognition which habit has stereotyped on their countenances, and a nod which says, “How d' ye do,” and “good b' ye” at the same time, know none of the true zest of life, save the little modicum which is involved in mere locomotion. They are like certain poetasters who in the race of rhyme, linger not for ideas. What to them are the border roses and beautiful vistas of rural pathways, or the heart-stirring faces and rich print-shop windows of the metropolis? Like Young Rapid, their watch-word is “keep moving;” and as to by way thoughts or observations, they'll none of them. Now, consider how much of the pleasure of life is contingent, and how little direct. In pressing ardently onward to a much desired goal, we, in a manner, prepare ourselves for disappointment. But the flower that smiles up to us unbidden from the hedge, the splendid prospect suddenly encountered, the en passant greeting—these are thrice enlivening because expected. Fertilizing and auspicious as is the energetic play of all the faculties, there is a deep wisdom in allowing the mind to lie fallow. Like the soil thus exposed to the grateful agencies of nature and its own self-evolved energy, its productiveness is eventually enhanced. Amid the exciting elements in which we live, there is a little danger of a dearth of action. And if one would press on with secure intelligence, let him sometimes loiter to scrutinize and meditate, let him behold what is around as well as before him. Oh, it is true philosophy, in such a shadowy world as ours, to linger momentarily over every joy-beam, were it only to garner up its blessedness in our memories! It is, after all, by dribblets that good comes to us; and thus only can we happily imbibe it to any great degree. A lover of books unless thoroughly imbued with the spirit of Dominie Sampson, feels rather oppressed than inspired on first entering an immense library. Yet such a one may lounge an hour over a bookseller's counter, or scan the pages of a racy magazine, enjoying the while a mood the most calmly pleasurable. In this, as in many other respects, there is a coincidence between the influences of art and literature. To one whose love of the beautiful is passionate and keen, there is something oppressive in the aspect of a well-stocked gallery, while an artist's sanctum proves a delightful resort; and a fine parlour picture, accidentally fallen in with, is productive of unalloyed delight. A single congenial volume represents to the imaginative mind the idea of literature; and a sketch or statue is an eloquent symbol of art. There is a philosophical principle involved in these facts. The truth is, the feelings of a man of ideal and susceptible temperament— and these characteristics are rarely disunited—are as delicate as they are vivid. An imposing array of objects, until singly and methodically scanned, by the variety and richness of their suggestions, confuse and satiate his sensitive taste. Individually, unobtrusively, unexpectedly addressed, his mind freely responds. The current of feeling thus receives an impetus, neither rude nor onerous, but precisely strong enough to urge it into a thoughtful and happy flow. Painters speak of a feeling for color; so is there a feeling for the beautiful and the true in man, which will not bear forcing nor feasting, but finds its own gratification in self-possessed and spontaneous observation. And thus the loiterers, on the world's highway, in true enjoyment and actual good, not unfrequently outstrip the most bustling and speedy of the careering multitude: —“as the fowl can keep Absolute stillness, poised aloft in air, And fishes front, unmoved, the torrent's sweep— So may the soul, through powers that faith bestows, Win rest, and peace, with bliss that angels share.” BROAD VIEWS. I love to steal away from a group of system-worshippers, and commune awhile with some solitary, uncourted being, whose scope of thought is unlimited by any artificial bounds, and the play of whose feelings is as free as the mountain wind. It is like leaving the smoky precincts of a highland hut, on a summer morning, to stand beneath the open sky and look forth upon the hills. There is something as refreshiug to the mind's eye in broad views of life and man, of art and literature, of facts and individuals, of nature and society, as there is to the bodily sense in majestic and boundless scenery. Broad views are characteristic of mental elevation. To the eagle's eye, when he hangs poised among the clouds, a common arena and universal atmosphere blend the aspect of earth and her myriads. By as certain a law, does the human universe present a general and softened picture to the intellect, sublimated by love and enlarged by culture. It was once my privilege to walk through a renowned repository of art, with a man of genius. I had scrutinized the various objects there preserved with companions of less calibre, who evidently prided themselves upon detecting discrepancies of style and errors of execution. My new cicerone, on the contrary, designated beauties in works, which, as wholes, are held in light estimation, and was continually directing my attention to the lesser excellencies of the more celebrated productions. This was the genuine spirit of noble criticism. Broad views are as naturally taken by gifted men, as limited ones by those of subordinate intelligence. You never hear an ardent lover of art or literature commenting con amore, upon the minor blemishes of a production in which genius is dominant. How do the aspirants for a reputation for gentility err by continually mooting the narrow topic of rank; and how do the would-be critics mistake their vocation by anxiously discussing etymologies! Broad views are the legitimate result of experience and general knowledge. The author of some modern farce makes one of his heroes, an accomplished Parisian duellist, console a foreign coxcomb whom he has challenged, by promising to have him `neatly packed up and directed.' Somewhat after this fashion, men appear to be dealt with in society. Because an individual sees fit to connect himself with a certain association, manifest an interest in a specific object, or temporarily display, with more than ordinary force, a particular principle of his nature, he is at once classed, newly baptized with a party name, enrolled, severed by an artificial distinction—in a word, `packed 37 up and directed.' An imaginary badge is affixed to him as significant as the philactery of the pharisee, the star of courtly honour, or the colored ribbon denoting academic or knightly preferment. To all the general interests and purposes of social life, he is proscribed. The usual method of answering the question, `What sort of a person is —?' is to designate the body political, scientific or otherwise, to which the individual is attached. A fashionable votary refers you to the `circle,' a religionist to the `sect,' and an intellectualist, to the `school;' each `packs up and directs' that most diverse, spontaneous, and free of human results—character, according to his whim. Classification is doubtless very applicable to minerals and plants, and labels have been found very useful in pharmacy. The inert, unalterable, fixed qualities of matter may be designated by a specific or generic name, may be `packed up and directed:' but the idea of so disposing of human beings—of indicating the endless modifications of feeling, imagination and thought, by any epithet referring only to opinions, is preposterous in the extreme. We have two brief, but most expressive terms for the two most sublime objects in the universe; we speak of sea and sky; but whoever thinks of taking profound cognizance of a particular wave, or devoutly following through the horizon a single, shifting cloud? We regard the various movements of the deep and the ever changing aspect of the heavens, with perfect confidence that the calm etherial canopy of the one still stretches in beauty above, and the fathomless depths of the other still sound on their way below. Why should we be less just to man? Why believe that the deep attributes, the great elements of his nature, are invaded by the aspects his versatile being presents in a world of circumstances? Why fix our eye upon the temporary wave or the passing cloud, when there is an infinite depth below and a glorious expanse above, which shall endure when the currents of opinion and the breezes of circumstance have died away on an illimitable shore? If Madame de Staël did not grievously err in her idea that mankind are never alike but `through affectation or design,' then this system of classifying is especially unjust, and to form any definite notion of an individual from the party-title affixed to him, is altogether unphilosophical. Yet how perversely we cut ourselves off from society calculated to inspire the deepest interest or to exert a most auspicious influence, by the dominion of some foolish antipathy! Hundreds are avoided or but casually known because they labor under the imputation of being antiquarians, phrenologists, or littérateurs, as if each and all of these characters might not be cultivated without absording humanity! Yet being `packed up and directed' under these or equally effective terms, men, ay, and women too, are rendered obnoxious to no small portion of their fellow creatures. `Why do you not converse with Miss A—?' I enquired of a very sensible lady at a party the other evening. `Oh, I'm terribly afraid of literary ladies,' she replied, with an ill-suppressed shudder at my suggestion. Now the lady in question had merely given to the public some lively sketches of common life, such as would have been very appropriate epistolary matter wherewith to entertain an absent friend; and she was in the habit of talking well of every thing in the whole range of topics, except literature, about which she knew and cared no more than was absolutely necessary to vindicate her claims to ordinary cultivation. Yet was she thus unceremoniously `packed up' in that peculiarly odious box marked `BLUES.' This miserable habit of our times is vividly illustrated by the manner in which those next most sacred things to mortals, books are treated. Celsus reprobates the idea of a fixed system of diet, on the ground that men are exposed to every variety of influence and condition of body; and if books have been justly considered as mental food, then may we, on the same ground, advantageously vary our reading. Yet there is scarcely an individual who has not `packed up and directed' numberless works, of the true value of which he is altogether unaware; packed them up in the iron casket of prejudice, and directed them to the far distant region of neglect. `It is the spirit of the soul's natural piety,' says a British divine, `to alight on whatever is touching or beautiful in every faith, and take thence its secret draught of pure and fresh emotion.' And so is it the spirit of him accustomed to broad views, to recognize man, as such, however artificially displayed, to blot out, at a glance, the label society has attached to him, and behold the earlier and indelible signature of nature;— —“that secret spirit of humanity, Which, 'mid her weeds and flowers, and silent Overgrowings, still survives.” THE END.</field>
