      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER FIRST. The disc of the setting sun just touched the outline of the forests crowning the heights of Hoboken, on a bright afternoon in September, 1780, when a single horseman made his appearance on the river-road leading from Tarrytown to New York, towards which place, then in the possession of the British troops under Sir Henry Clinton, he was slowly trotting his horse. His journey was nearly ended with the day, for the needle-like spire of Trinity Church had been, for the last half hour, a prominent object in his eye, and the expanded bay, girt with its majestic islands, and covered with the fleets of England, assured him that he was approaching the headquarters of the British armies. He rode slowly along, with his arms folded across his breast, and the reins dropped carelessly over the drooping neck of his large brown horse, who stumbled and floundered over the rough road as if he had been ridden fast and far. The horseman was a heavily-framed man, with a dark countenance, rendered still darker by thick brows and whiskers. His face wore an expression of dogged resolution and reckless daring. His costume was partly that of a yeoman, partly military,—a fustian frock buttoned to the throat, and reaching to the stirup, and a broad flapping hat that he wore,—belonging to the class of yeomanry, and a leathern belt stuck with a brace of pistols, and sustaining a serviceable broadsword, with stout buff, buck-skin breeches, somewhat soiled and darkened by long service,—appertaining to the latter profession. He appeared lost in thought, and indifferent to surrounding objects; but the alert and wary movements of his eyes, and, what a little closer scrutiny discovered, one hand of his folded arms resting on the butt of a pistol, and the other grasping the hilt of his broadsword, showed that he was on watch for sudden danger, and prepared to meet it. He had just gained the brow of a gentle declivity over which the road wound, from whence there was a view of the town, and from which the broad banner of England, floating above the quarters of General Clinton, was full in sight, when the sun dipped beneath the horizon; at the same instant the report of the sunset gun fired from the Battery reached his ears—the flags on fort and shipping descended from their staffs, and over the fortified town night and watchfulness took the place of day and security. The horseman now gathered the reins in his huge, brown fist, settled himself in his saddle, and muttering, in a sort of subdued growl: “Come, Bruin, we have loitered full long—stir, stir! a measure of corn and a cup of sack await us at the inn; so forward!” He applied, as he spoke, both spur and whip to the sides of his beast, who, forthwith, throwing back his ears, set off towards the town at a round pace. A short ride further through a straggling suburb brought him in front of a low barrier thrown across the street, with a sentinel pacing before it, and a guard-house with a group of soldiers a few yards within, on the left. When he came in sight of this obstacle, instead of checking, he urged his horse forward, and rode directly towards it as if he intended to clear it at a flying leap. The sentinel, on perceiving him, challenged, in a stern tone. Without replying, he continued to advance at speed till within ten feet of the gate, when, with a sudden and powerful jerk, he threw his horse backward on his haunches, and leaped off to the ground, just as the ball from the sentinel's musket hummed harmlessly over his head. “Well aimed for a beef-fed John Bull,” cried the horsemam, with a loud laugh, springing into his saddle again. The corporal of the guard, with his command, on hearing the report of the piece, hastened to the post, and a dozen muskets were instantly levelled at the rider, who sat immoveably on his steed, gazing coolly on his adversaries. “How, sir! What means this bravado?” demanded the corporal of the guard; “surrender, or I fire upon you.” “Softly, good sir corporal! You've wasted powder enough already. I did but try to see how well you kept the barriers— and what mettle your men are made of; for the story goes that a pretty wench or a jug of whiskey can cross your post in broad noon, and the sentinel's never the wiser. It's “Who goes there?” “Man with a jug o' whiskey.” “Stand, man! advance jug o' whiskey and give us a taste.” Or, “Who goes there?” “Husband and wife.” “Stand, husband! advance wife and give us a kiss!” Ha, ha, ho! this is your system of tactics down in York, they say up above. Ho, ha, ha!” His laugh met no other return than a few round oaths from the soldiers, while the corporal replied, “You should come then in a wench's shape to test us, fellow.” “Wench or whiskey, I must go into the town.” “Show your passport.” The man drew from his pocket an iron box, deliberately tapped the lid, opened it, took therefrom a pinch of snuff, and handed it over to the soldiers. One of them, only, acknowledged the compliment by thrusting his arm through the barrier and helping himself to half the contents. “So, ho, man, you'd best take a shovel and fill your knapsack. Here, sergeant, is my passport,” added the horseman, thrusting his fingers beneath the snuff, and extracting a folded paper, crumpled and dingy. It was pronounced correct. “Now, pass, sir,” said the subaltern, “but if you approach the next post after this fashion, may they send a score of bullets through your jacket. I should not have borne with you as I have, but my orders led me to look out for one of your cut and kidney.” While he was speaking the barrier was thrown open, and the horseman dashed through with a coarse joke at the expense of the soldiers, which, in the breasts of those gentlemen, excited wrath rather than mirth. In a few seconds horse and rider were lost to their gaze in the increasing darkness and gloom of the distant streets. After riding a short distance, the stranger turned from the principal street to the left, and entered a winding lane, which, by a circuitous route, led him towards the Battery. On the corner of this street, (then called Queen,) and Broad street, he came to an inn, from which proceeded the sounds of mirth and music. Here he drew rein and dismounted amid a throng of idlers, gave his horse to a negro hostler with strict injunctions to take the best care of him, and then, with the cool impudence of a man confident in great physical powers, passed through the crowd, jostling, to either side, soldier and townsman, and entered the house. Proceeding directly to the tap-room, which was filled with smokers and tipplers, he called loudly: “Black Sam!” “Here, sir. What gen'lman wish?” “A can of ale dashed with brandy.” Then striding across the room, he flung himself into a chair, which a little, thin man vacated at his approach, and throwing his feet over a table on which three or four men with blue coats, cockades, and strait swords, were resting their mugs, he received his potation, with the addition, also, of a pipe and tobacco. Leaving him to discuss these at his leisure, the object of alehouse curiosity and the centre of sundry ominous glances, we will change our scene to the quarters of Sir Henry Clinton.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER SECOND. At the period of our story the British army under General Clinton held quiet possession of New York. Sir George Rodney, with a fleet, recently arrived from Great Britain, rode at anchor in the bay. General Washington, with his army, lay at West Point and along both shores of the Hudson, augmenting his forces, and making extraordinary preparations,—with the cooperation of the French fleet and army, under Count de Rochambeau and the Chevalier de Terney, lying at Rhode Island,—to attack New York. With this object in view, vast magazines of military stores, including vessels, batteaux, cannon, and provisions, had been collected at West Point. Sir Henry Clinton was informed of this through spies; and it became an object with him to get possession of this post, not only that he might defeat the scheme of the Americans, but also open an avenue of communication with the army in Canada. But independent of either of these objects, he saw, indeed, that on the possession of the Highlands by the British army, rested solely the tenure by which New York could much longer be held by the crown. Therefore, he prepared to direct all his energies to the accomplishment of this design—to concentrate all his strength to this one object, with the determination to seek no other conquest until the flag of Great Britain should float above the citadel of West Point and its dependencies. The quarters of Sir Henry Clinton were in a mansion called the `Kennedy-House,' on the southwest corner of Broadway, adjoining the Battery. About eight o'clock on the evening of our story, it presented a gay scene. Before the door a military band were, at intervals, playing popular national airs; officers were promenading up and down, or lounging about the hall-entrance in conversation; horses, held by orderlies, champed their bits impatiently, and pawed the ground; the apartments were brilliant with lights, and, from the open windows, came the laughter and musical voices of women; children were playing about the equestrian statue of George the Second in the Bowling-green, and a little further off, on the sward, a party of youths and maidens of the city, taking advantage of a waltz played by the band, were whirling around in dizzy circles with great spirit. All was life and gaiety, and no where were visible any signs of the sanguinary war that filled the land. Within the mansion, and in a small, plain, but richly furnished apartment, sat around a table, to which the wine and dessert had been transferred from the adjoining dining room, a party consisting altogether of gentlemen. At the time we are introduced to them, one of the number, a middle aged man, with an air of command, and habited in a military surtout, which betrayed no insignia of the wearer's rank, was warmly speaking, while the others were interested listeners. “Now, gentlemen, I have shown you the importance of the secret correspondence I have so long been engaged in through Major Andre, with this unknown individual. That he is in the confidence of Washington is certain. His information has never, in a single instance, proved incorrect. In his last communication, he said the time had at length arrived when it had become expedient, and was for our interests, to bring the affair to a crisis; saying further, that, if I complied with his terms action should at once take the place of writing. These terms, and the means of obtaining an interview with him, he did not mention, but promises to send us, by a special messenger, a full exposition of his views, and his real name, for which, hitherto, he has adopted “Gustavus,” as Andre has that of “John Anderson.” “Have you any idea, Sir Henry, who your mysterious correspondent may be?” asked a gentleman in the uniform of a British Admiral, who was seated opposite to him. “I have my suspicions, Rodney; but until the arrival of the letters to destroy or confirm them, I will not injure the fair fame, even of a foe, by whispering them.” At this instant a slave in a livery of silver and green, entered the room with coffee, when, through the half-open door, a noise came from the street of voices in uproarious altercation. “What's the disturbance without there, Nero?” demanded Sir Henry Clinton, half rising from the table. “Ony de press-gang, massa! Dey cotch big rebel at black Sam's—he no want to go `board ship, mas' Rodney—so um yell little bit—dat's all, massa Knyphors'um.” “I was afraid, General Knyphausen,” said Clinton, resuming his seat, and addressing a stout, corpulent officer, with stiff, white hair, highly powdered, wearing the uniform of a foreigner of high military rank. “I was afraid your thick-sculled Germans and my English guards were at loggerheads again. Hark! what is that?” “To the main-guard with him! Drag him to the Sugar-House! Give him a birth in the Old Jersey!” mingled with the clashing of weapons, came loudly from the street. “It is time for me to interfere,” said Clinton, rising and advancing through the hall, followed by the others. “They have a harder case than common to deal with; and, I fear, notwithstanding my strict orders, blood will be shed in their anxiety to secure him.” When they reached the door they saw, by the light of the lamps, a gigantic fellow with his back planted against the iron railing enclosing the equestrian statue of the King, defending himself with a huge broadsword from the assault of half a dozen men in blue coats and cockades, who were thrusting at him with swords, but unable, from the circling sweep of his powerful weapon, with which he kept clear a wide space around him, to get near enough to use them with effect. “Hold, men!” cried General Clinton, as the leader of the assailants drew a pistol, and was levelling it at the man's breast, swearing he would put an end to the contest. “Put up your pistol, captain of the gang—and you, fellow, give your weapon to the captain of the guard.” “If he will have it let him take it,” said the man menacingly. “I am protected by a fair passport, and was quietly on my way from the inn where I put up, to these quarters, when these skulking chaps followed and set upon me here; and by — if they hav'nt had a taste of my quality by this time, perhaps they'd like to trouble me again.” “Advance corporal of the guard and secure him,” said General Clinton sternly. “Charge bayonets! Forward-march!” cried the subaltern, who, on the first alarm, had turned out his command. The press-gang opened to either side and left our quondam horseman exposed to the bristling row of bayonets that advanced upon and enclosed him. “Surrender!” cried the sergeant of the guard. “I am an American citizen—the bearer of a message to General Clinton, and am protected by his passport. Lay a finger on me at your peril.” As he spoke he drew a pistol from his belt and cocked and levelled it at the head of the corporal. “Ha! says he?” exclaimed Sir Henry Clinton, hearing his words, and turning to Sir George Rodney; “our man by haliden. Stand back corporal. Fellow, I am General Clinton. If you are the bearer of papers to me, come forward and deliver them. First resign your weapons.” The man advanced, gave up his pistols aud sword, and, taking his passport, gave it to the General, who, after glancing at it said: “It is as I thought. Follow me.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER THIRD. Accompanied by the other gentlemen, and followed by the messenger, Sir Henry Clinton led the way to the apartment he had left; when closing the doors, and satisfying himself that he was secure from interruption, he turned to the man and demanded the letters of which he was the bearer. Unbuckling his belt he touched a concealed spring in the empty scabbard, when the steel dropped to the ground. Taking it up he drew from it three rolls of thin Indian paper addressed to Sir Henry Clinton, and gave them to him. After rapidly glancing over the contents, the British General energetically struck the table. “Gentlemen, it turns out as I anticipated. My secret correspondent is —. You may leave the room “trusty Jack Smithson,” as I see it is on the back of the letters. Ho! without there. Markham, take Mr. Smithson under your care till I want him again, and see that he neither leaves the house nor has communication with any one.” The captain of the guard received his charge and retired. “It is as I thought,” continued Sir Henry Clinton, “General Arnold is my correspondent.” “Arnold!” exclaimed the others simultaneously. “Arnold, and none other—and on this supposition have I so long kept up the correspondence. We will now examine these letters. Here is one endorsed “important and strictly private.” Breaking the seal, he rapidly run his eyes over it; his features as he read lighting up with animation. Suddenly rising, he said with energy, “This affair has got to assume a magnitude and importance I had not anticipated. This morning General Arnold took the command at West Point.” “At West Point,” repeated Rodney, with surprise. “Then it is ours,” said General Knyphausen, shivering his glass on the board in the animation of the moment. “Listen to his proposal. He makes me a direct offer to surrender himself, West Point, and its dependencies, with all the military stores and provisions, cannon, vessels, and flotillas, in such a manner as to contribute every advantage to His Majesty's arms, and the safety of our men. Now, gentlemen, are we in a way to pluck the fruit so long ripening.” “There is, indeed, an opening for a successful operation that claims our most assiduous care,” said Sir George Rodney. “West Point appears to me an object of such vast importance that no hazard or expense ought to be weighed against it. It will give us control of the Hudson from the sea to its source, facilitate our intercourse with the Northern army, and be a barrier to the intercourse between New England and the States of Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania.” “And alsho, vat is of equal importanshe,” said General Knyphausen; “it vill terange the plan of te kombined armies ant vleet of te Fransh ant te Americans in teir contemplate attack on dis city of Neuve York.” “West Point must be ours, gentleman,” said General Clinton decidedly. “From its peculiar position and strength, it is the Gibraltar of this rebel country, and must be taken before we can get a permanent foot-hold in America. Its possession offers to us all the advantages you have named. But on the ground alone of defeating the projected attack on New York, it becomes us to pursue any plan that will place it in our hands. Not only will its capture serve to defeat the project of a combined attack, but, by cutting off their supplies, produce disaffection, and ultimately desertion in the ranks of the rebels, and excite discontent among their French allies. It will be of incalculable advantage to the service, and crown the campaign with triumphant success. Let us now see what further this traitor-General has to say. He is no stickler, but comes out with a clean breast. Ho! here is the whole gist of the matter. Hear, gentleman!” continued he, reading from the paper in his hand. `I wish you to send some one in your confidence, (I should prefer Major Andre, and, indeed do not desire to negotiate with any one else, as I deem him the most befitting person) fully authorised by your house to confer with me, that the risk and profits of the co-partnership may be fully and clearly understood. A speculation might at this time be made to some advantage with ready money.' “Bah! this then is the way the wind blows.” “Sent to him, Generale, von pag of monies to py Vest Poin.” “So Arnold has a mercenary, as well as a revengeful motive in this treason,” said Rodney with some surprise. “I am told his extravagant style of living has involved him in irretrievable pecuniary embarrassments, that he has resorted to shifts, as trustee of public funds, that have laid him open to suspicion and lost him the confidence of Congress; the first intimation of the displeasure of which, was conveyed to him by the promotion of five Major-generals over his head. A brave officer he certainly is; but no excess of physical courage can atone for the want of moral principle, of which he seems entirely destitute. He is proud, vain, and hasty of speech, with many private vices which he has vainly hoped to gloss over by the brilliancy of his military career. In this he has been unsuccessful, and his elevated rank only makes more conspicuous the man's private actions. Smarting under mortification, disgust, and the stings of wounded self-love, he has determined to avenge his real or fancied wrongs on his country, and has resolved to offer her up as a sacrifice to his injured pride. He accordingly wrote to me, under the signature of `Gustavus,' assuming, as you have just seen in the paragraph I read to you, the character of a merchant. This was eighteen months ago. The correspondence had continued for a twelvemonth, before I could arrive at any probability as to who he might be. At length, being confident, from the accuracy and importance of his information, that he must be of high rank, and a member of Washington's councils of war, I began to make myself acquainted with the characters of the American Generals, and investigate their histories, to discover what sufficient causes of dissatisfaction existed, to induce any one of them to turn traitor to his country. My suspicions, from obvious reasons, rested on General Arnold, and we now see that they are confirmed. It is gold the gentleman wants, and it must not be withheld, for it is plain he will not stir a step without being paid for it. I must send Andre to close the `bargain' with him, forthwith.” “But” said Admiral Rodney, “how shall we be able to take advantage of this man's treason? We cannot place an expedition to take possession of West Point in secret, and Washington will be prompt to defeat any scheme for which we make open preparations.” “Every body knows, Sir George, that we have long contemplated, with the aid of your fleet, an expedition to the Chesapeake This will be a good mask to cover our real designs. Under this feint we must prepare for a sudden movement up the Hudson.” “Admiral. I second it with all my heart,” exclaimed Rodney. “'Tish ver' exshellant. Ve vill take te repel vort now, Sir Shorge ant Sir Henree.” A little more conversation followed, in which the steps to be taken for bringing the important affair to a crisis, were settled; the messenger was called in and dismissed with letters to Arnold, when the two gentlemen took their departure, to make preparations for the contemplated movement against West Point, and promptly second the treachery of its commander.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER FOURTH. About three o'clock the following afternoon, a sloop of war got under weigh in the harbor of New York, and spreading sail after sail, stood boldly up the Hudson. As night approached she entered the Highlands, and came to an anchor off Verplanck's point, and within range of an American battery thrown up on the head-land. Her progress up the river had been watched by spectators on shore, with apprehension not unmingled with curiosity. But as she stood standing on her course without manifesting any hostile purpose, she was supposed to bear a flag for the purpose of opening a treaty with Washington, and was suffered to pass the several batteries that lined the shore, without being fired into. After she had swung round to her anchor, and her sails were furled and a double watch set, two gentlemen came on deck, and took an elevated position on the quarter deck from which, with night-glasses they began carefully to reconnoitre the land. One of them was in the uniform of an English Naval Captain, and was the commander of the vessel. The other was a handsome young man, with noble features, a manly and elegant person, refined by an air of grace and high breeding. He was dressed as a British Army officer, and his bearing was marked by the frankness of the soldier, tempered with the courtesy of an accomplished gentleman. While his companion constantly kept the glass to his eye, in the direction of the western shore, he paced the deck with an impatient step. At length he paused for an instant to glance landward, and exclaimed in a disappointed tone: “No boat yet Captain? The night is advancing!” “Nothing in sight but a brace of rebel barges, that are lying off, and on, to prevent us communicating with the shore. They suspect us strongly of being here on mischief, and the good dames inland, doubtless tremble for their poultry and dairies.” “A boat!” cried the young officer, who, while the Captain was speaking, had placed the glass to his eye. “It is putting towards the ship. Ah! By Heaven! all is lost! The guard-boat has challenged and detained it! No, they are permitted to pass, and are rapidly approaching. It must be him we seek! I will receive him in your state room, Sutherland. I have some papers to prepare beforehand, and will leave to you the honor of ushering the gentleman below.” The officer had left the deck but a few minutes, when the watch on the forecastle suddenly sung out in a rough stern voice, “Boat ahoy!” “Holloa!” was the distant reply, in a voice equally hoarse. “What boat is that?” “Ferry-boat!” “Is this the way you come athwart His Majesty's hawser?” growled the officer of the watch. “Order that boat alongside!” said the Captain, advancing to the gangway. “Aye, aye, sir.” The boat was pulled alertly alongside, and a man stepped from her and ascended the side. “Which is Mr. John Anderson,” he asked in a bold, swaggering manner. “If you have business with any one on board the Vulture, you bear some token from him you came from?” said the Captain half interrogating. “West Point,” said the man in a subdued tone. “'Tis right. Follow me below.” “Where is Gen—the principal?” exclaimed the young officer, on seeing a rough, gigantic fellow, enter the cabin behind his friend. “On shore,” said Smithson, gruffly, “and bade me give you this letter if you be Mr. John Anderson.” “Give it me!” he said, taking it from his hesitating hold and tearing it open. `This will be delivered to you,' he read, `by Smithson, who will take you to a retired place on shore, where with perfect saftey to yourself, we can confer togather on the matters touching your mission to the Highlands. Gustavus.' “Leave the ship! By—no, Andre,” said the Captain: “I allow no soul on board the Vulture to put foot on rebel soil. If this General wants to see you, he must come here.” “That he was to meet me on board, I certainly understood from his letters to Sir Henry,” said Major Andre; “but if he fears to trust his person with us, I see no alternative but to do as he desires.” “Not if Harry Sutherland can help it shall you have any thing to do with his proposition. If you are caught on shore, they'll hang you as sure as the devil. No, no. `Twill never do, my dear boy. Never! If he wants to see you let him come and see you here.” “My dear Sutherland, the advantages in this matter are not his, but ours, and we must not calculate risks in securing them, so vast and important as they are to His Majesty's arms. My own life is nothing weighed against the value of West Point. But there is no need of sacrificing life. There is no danger under cover of night, of going on shore and meeting this man; an hour's time will suffice for the interview, and I shall be on board again, by two hours before daybreak. “Major Andre, I'll be — if you do.” “Not a word, Sutherland,” said the officer playfully, “this project must not be given up at a time when it is about to be crowned with success—the hour has arrived when the fruits of our long pending negotiation may be gathered—when the hopes of General Clinton may be realised—when the reward for which we have so long toiled, may be reaped. Fanciful apprehensions ought to have no weight with me now; nothing, life itself would not make me waver. Every thing depends on me this night. I will go on shore and meet Arnold. I see no great risk in it, and what there is, I cheerfully encounter for the sake of the object I have in view.” “Well, do as you will, Andre. I have no power to control your movements, my orders being to afford you every means of achieving successfully your object. If you must go,—go, and God bless you! but I fear evil will come of it.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER FIFTH. Shortly afterwards, enveloped in a blue greatcoat, which entirely hid his uniform, Andre went over the side into the boat accompanied by Smithson, and in a few moments they were lost to the eyes of those on deck in the shadows of the shore. In the boat was a negro, who, with Smithson, pulled actively towards the land, and in a quarter of an hour after leaving the ship, the little skiff shot into a narrow inlet, shrouded by the beetling cliffs, in impenetrable gloom. Andre instinctively laid his hand on his pistols and assumed an attitude of caution and defence. The oars were laid aside as they entered the creek, and the men drew the boat some distance inland under the branches of the overhanging trees. At length they ceased their exertions. “We must be near the spot now, Sambo. Open the whites of your eyes and look sharp about you.” “'Tis so goramity dark, massa Jack, nigger no see one debbil bit. Dis look wery like de place, nebberdeless. Chow! hear dat bull-frog close here, mass Jack? I hearn him here when we lef? Ki! 'tis jis de place for sartain sure.” “Boat, there!” said a low voice from a short distance off. “Boat it is!” answered Smithson. “Have you been successful!” “He is here.” An exclamation of satisfaction was uttered; a heavy footstep hastily approached, and the indistinct figure of a man appeared on the bank. The next instant a dark lantern was sprung by him, and a bright light shone into the boat, exposing the occupants, while the individual behind it remained invisible. “You are welcome, sir,” said the stranger, after a moment's survey of the party. “Smithson you will remain in charge of 2 the boat, and take it round to where I have directed you to meet us.” The British officer now landed. The greeting between the two persons was marked, by haughtiness on one part, and fawning courtesy on the other. The words of the Englishman, in exchanging salutations, were few and brief. The other, who was a stout gentlemanly looking man, with a decided military air, without noticing his manner, passed his arm through his, and led him by the light of the lantern a few yards from the boat to a forest path, in which stood two saddled horses, tied to a tree. “You will mount one of these horses, if you please, sir,” said the stranger, who, it is perhaps unnecessary to say, was General Arnold. “How mean you, General Arnold?” demanded Andre, in surprise: “is not our interview to take place here?” “So far as conversation goes it might, sir. But I have a portion of correspondence, several important documents, plans of correspondence, and other papers necessary to our purpose, to exhibit to you. For these we must have lights and the privacy of a room.” “Well.” “A short distance from this place is a retired house, tenanted by Smithson. He is away, and there we shall be private. I have brought these horses that we may ride thither.” After hesitating an instant, the young Englishman, as if determined to risk every thing to effect the object of his mission, said abruptly, “mount, sir, I attend you.” For a few moments they threaded the forest path, and then emerged into a highroad, where their way, from the absence of trees, became lighter. They rode forward in silence, for neither (the one, probably from contempt, the other from shame at the degrading part he was playing) felt disposed to converse, except on the topic that had brought two such opposite spirits in contact, and this had been mutually deferred till their arrival at the place of their destination. Suddenly the dark meditations of Arnold, and the pleasing recollections of England, with which the light-hearted Andre was beguiling the way, were interrupted by the stern challenge of a sentinel, a few yards in advance. Andre looked up and saw that they were just entering a small village. “Friends!” replied Arnold. “Advance and give the countersign.” “Congress.” “Pass, friends.” All this passed like a dream to Andre's senses. In an instant, however, he realized the full extent of his danger, reined in his horse and half turned to fly. Arnold's hand was instantly laid on his bridle. “This is no time to waver. Ride on with me. There is no danger to a cool head and resolute spirit.” The words were spoken in a low or hurried tone close to Andre's ear. A moment's reflection convinced him that it was vain to think of retreating, and that his only alternative now, was to meet the emergencies of his situation with coolness and presence of mind. He therefore rode on, simply saying, in a tone of calm, and dignified reproof, “You did not tell me, sir, that you were about to conduct me within the American lines, else I should have insisted on coming to terms with you where we landed, and not so imprudently risked my liberty, and perhaps my life.” “I presumed you placed that confidence in my honor, Major Andre, which would have rendered such an intimation gratuitous. With a passport signed by me, you are aware, that you can return whenever you please.” Andre said nothing, but the curl of his lip at the mention of “honor,” would have conveyed more to his companion, had it been light enough for him to have seen the expression of his features, than a volume of verbal replies. In a few moments afterward they arrived at a low farm house, with a paling running along the front. As they dismounted they were startled by a heavy cannonading from the river, but some distance below. “We are detected,” exclaimed Arnold, “that firing is at the Vulture.” The two gentlemen hastily ascended the steps of the portico, and looked southward. A league below (for that distance had Arnold led Andre from his ship) they saw the Vulture apparently wrapped in flames, from the blaze of incessant discharges of artillery, both from the shore and her own deck. From the batteries on Verplanck's point, they beheld a long line of guns belching forth fire, the glare of which illuminated land and water far and wide, while by the light of her own guns they distinguished every spar and rope of the sloop of war as distinctly as at noon-day. “Good God! all is discovered—all is lost!” cried Arnold.— “To horse!” “Hold!” said Andre, laying his hand on his arm, “you need fear nothing. The Americans think the sloop lies too near the shore for their good, and are firing to compel her to change her position. See, she is already making sail.” For a quarter of an hour longer they anxiously watched the movements of the vessel, which, after returning the fire of the Americans by a few broadsides, got under weigh, and still visible by the blaze from the guns on shore, slowly dropped down the river, and came to anchor some distance below, and beyond the reach of the batteries. Satisfied that his conjectures as to the cause of the firing were correct, he turned to Arnold and said, “It will only be a longer pull back for that black bearded esquire of yours, General Arnold, with a little unwelcome day-light to help him, too, I fear, unless we can briefly despatch our business.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER SIXTH. Without replying, General Arnold led the way up stairs, by the light of his dark-lantern, and ushered Andre into a small room, the door of which he carefully closed and secured; then cautiously examining the apartment to see that there was no intruder on their privacy, he placed the light on a small table, and motioning to his guest to take one of two chairs placed by it, he seated himself in the other, and proceeded to lay on the table several papers which he drew from a concealed pocket in the breast of his surtout. While thus engaged, Andre sat silently surveying his features. They were cast in a noble mould. But the lofty forehead was contracted, and scowling with the dark and uneasy thoughts of the mind within; the well-formed mouth was compressed with gloomy determination, and his fine eyes, in which nature had secreted the power that controls and commands men, were restless, and shunned the calm gaze of his companion's. “I am now ready, Major Andre,” said General Arnold after arranging his papers on the table, “to listen to Sir Henry Clinton's proposition.” Andre continued to survey him for an instant longer, and then replied, with a look in which scorn and pity were equally mingled. “These shall be laid before you when you have detailed the mode by which you can favor His Majesty's arms.” “I can read the meaning of your glance, Major Andre,” said Arnold, slightly coloring, “and appreciate your estimation of me in relation to the part I am about to act. But I have weighed all this well. I am prepared to meet the scorn and contempt of gentlemen, so that the personal feelings that I have in this matter are gratified. Major Andre, I am an injured man! I have repeatedly fought for, and five times shed my blood in defence of my country, and she has rewarded me, not only with contumely and neglect, but with open insult. It is useless for me to unfold to you the tissue of causes by which I have been goaded on to this step. It is enough, that I have calmly resolved on it, and for nearly two years have been slowly but surely laying the foundation for its completion. I have now reached the point when deliberation or repentance are alike vain. When I resolved to repay my country for the wrongs she had loaded me with, it only remained to decide the best means of doing it, so that I could bring about advantage to myself as well as injury to the cause I was about to desert. My reward from the crown, I was aware, would be measured by the injury I inflicted on its enemies. It occurred to me that I could accomplish my object through West Point. So soon as this idea occurred to me, I directed all my efforts to get appointed commander at this important post. I have succeeded. It is now in my hands and shall be transferred to those of General Clinton, provided that—” here the arch-traitor hesitated and looked down, but the next instant continued with assumed indifference, “provided that the price I name for my services shall be agreed to.” “Name it, sir.” “One hundred thousand pounds sterling, in five quarterly payments, one quarter in hand, and the rank of Major General in the British Army.” “Your services should be great to merit this, sir.” “Let us weigh one against the other, and see which will kick the beam,” he said, with a faint attempt to laugh and appear at his ease. Unrolling a small chart, he spread it on the table with the self-satisfied air of a man who expects to give surprise; “Here,” he said, displaying the map which was covered with lines of fortifications, “here is a plan of the works at West Point. You will perceive, on inspecting it, that besides the principal fort, there are three lines of fortifications between the river and the summit of the innermost range of highlands, composed of upwards of forty redoubts. But this map will serve only to give you a general outline of the works. Here is a paper which will show the number of men stationed at each, with the amount of military stores and provisions. Here is a third, showing the easiest paths and means of access. On examination it will sufficiently explain itself. Here is a fourth, containing the Artillery Orders which have just been published at West Point, showing how each corps shall dispose of itself in case of alarm. This you will find of vast importance, as it will enable you to know the precise condition of every part of the garrison when you attack. Here is a fifth document, in which you will find an estimate of the forces at the different posts. This, marked F. No. VI., will show how many men it will take to man the works. In this, numbered G. VII., you will find a return of the ordnance in the different forts, redoubts, and batteries; also remarks on the works, describing the construction of each, and its strong and weak points. Lastly, here is a report of the last council of war held at head-quarters and it contains hints written with pencil in the margin, respecting the probable operations of the campaign. I yesterday received it from General Washington himself.” As he finished speaking he laid the remaining paper of the pacquet on the table and looked up with an air of triumph. As he anticipated, the expression of the young soldier's countenance was that of undisguised astonishment and gratification. “Place those papers in my possession and carry out in your own person the spirit of them to the letter, and the reward you have named shall be yours,” said Andre with animation. Arnold coldly smiled, and said, “It shall be mine to see that the post at West Point is weakened by such a disposition of the troops as shall leave but a small force for its defence. At those points most inaccessible, I have ordered scaling ladders, (ostensibly for a very different purpose) to be constructed in the forest, where, at the place marked X on the plan, you will find them piled up ready for use. What think you, Major Andre—is it well planned.” “It is most skilfully planned, sir,” said the young man, lost in wonder at this perfection of treason. “It is, sir. But it remains to be ably seconded on the part of Sir Henry Clinton. The only obstacle to its success will be the difficulty of openly embarking troops on the Hudson without its object being suspected. The vigilance of Washington never sleeps!” As he spoke these last words, his voice fell, and he looked hurriedly about as if he felt or feared his presence. “This difficulty is easily settled,” said Andre, slightly smiling at the sudden change in his manner. “Under the pretext of an expedition to the Chesapeake, of which, doubtless, you have heard some rumors, troops are now embarking in Rodney's fleet. By to-morrow morning there will be eight thousand on ship-board, ready to ascend the river at a moment's warning,” “Then is success certain. As soon as it shall be known that your ships are approaching, I shall dispatch parties from the garrison to the gorges in the hills and other remote passes, under the pretence of stopping the advance of the enemy in those quarters. There I intend they shall remain until your troops have landed and marched to the garrison through other passes, where there will be left no troops to oppose them.” “I cannot refrain from complimenting you, sir, on the masterly manner in which you have laid your plans, it is the perfection of —” Andre hesitated, when Arnold completed the sentence, “of treason. So be it, sir. If I bring about my ends I care not what name men give it.” The terms of his treachery having been agreed on, Arnold now carefully divided the papers in two equal parcels, white Andre filled out a carte blanche previously signed and delivered to him by Sir Henry Clinton for this purpose, in which the terms of General Arnold were acceded to, on the fulfilment of the conditions implied therein. He gave this, covering a cheque for twenty thousand pounds sterling, to Arnold, and received from him in return the papers in two parcels, which, at the urgent desire of Arnold, who manifested the greatest anxiety for their security, he placed separately between his stockings and feet, drawing his boots on over all. General Arnold now pleaded the necessity of returning forthwith to his quarters at the Beverly House opposite West Point; and delaying only long enough to fill out a passport for the protection of Major Andre on his way to his boat, he a few moments afterward took leave of him before the house and galloped rapidly northward.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER SEVENTH. “So the Gen'ral's off without never a thankee,” said a in not the best humored tones in the world. Andre turned round and beheld Smithson. “Ha! boatswain,” said he quickly, you are in good time.— Loose not a moment in conveying me on board the Vulture.” “There are two parties to that bargain,” said the man in an indifferent manner, proceeding to place his oars in bickets on the portico. “What, fellow.” “Fellow not me, said the boatswain doggedly; “I am at no man's beck and bidding. I have my reasons for serving the General, but am not every man's servant you may depend. If you want to get back to your ship you have arms, and can pull an oar I reckon, as well's another body.” Annoyed and irritated at the unexpected position assumed by his guide, Andre paced the ground a few seconds, reflecting upon his situation and deliberating on the course he should pursue; then turning to the man who was removing his thick over coat with great deliberation, he said in a tone of mild entreaty: “Smithson, my good fellow, take this gold and conduct me to your boat.” “Mr. John Anderson, what Jack Smithson wont do for favor he wont do for gold. Besides I have been up all night and I want sleep. The Vulture lays full two leagues below, and it would be broad day before I could reach her. No, no, nothing less than the General's orders will make me put oar in row-lock this night.” “Fatal negligence on the part of Arnold not to leave instructions to this effect,” said Andre bitterly. Turning full upon the man he suddenly drew a pistol and leveled it at his breast—saying in a stern voice, “swear to guide me to your boat or you are a dead man.” “Is this your game, ha!” said Smithson with a laugh, quickly seizing the muzzle of the pistol in his gigantic grasp and turning it upward—“now Mr. Anderson if you are wise you'd best put up that play-thing, for I am not a going to be frightened at such things as them. Good night.” Thus speaking, he released his hold of the pistol and entered the dwelling. Mortified at his want of success, indignant at the supposed carelessness of Arnold, and not a little alarmed at the danger of being discovered within the American lines, the young man stood still for a moment with indecision. Then approaching a light Smithson had placed in a window, he unfolded Arnold's passport, which he had not yet examined, to see to what extent it could protect him. To his surprise and infinite relief, he saw that there were two passports, one authorizing him to return to New York by land, the other by water, with duplicates for Smithson, who was directed to see Mr. John Anderson safe beyond the American lines. With a face, from which all traces of anxiety had disappeared, he entered the room and placed the passports in Smithson's hands. The man read them twice over with the most annoying deliberation, and without speaking placed his own passport in his pocket, and returned the others, resumed his dreadnaught and flapped hat, walked out of the house, and gazed steadily at the eastern skies for a few seconds, when he spoke: “Mr. Anderson, it will be day-break in twenty minutes. It is no use trying to get back to the Vulture, for it's flood tide and blowing a dead head wind. The best oarsman on the Hudson, could'nt pull to her before ten o'clock, and during that time, there's no knowing what might happen to us. I would'nt like to trust myself in a boat, for there are boat rowers along shore that little care for passports. We must ride to King's ferry just above here, and cross to Verplanck's Point, and so go down on the west side if you want to get to New York.” After putting a few questions to him, Andre was satisfied that the danger by land was less than by the river, and that there remained no alternative but to take the land route. Hitherto he had worn his uniform concealed, even from Smithson, beneath his great coat; but he saw the danger of travelling in this manner, and the necessity of appearing simply as a plain citizen. To effect this change, it became necessary to make a confident, in some sort, of his guide. “Smithson,” he said, as the other was busily saddling a second horse, “if you have a worn coat I should like to exchange mine for it, as I fear the one I wear may subject me to suspicions.” As he spoke he approached the light in the window, and threw open his surtout. The eyes of the man opened with surprise as they fell on the dazzling uniform of a British officer of high rank. “By the twelve apostles!” he said advancing, “this is a discovery. A British officer in the —” “Hush, my dear fellow,” said Andre, affecting the voice and manner of an exquisite—“a—a—you see a—Mr. Smithson—that we young fellows, a—that is you know—we like to dress gaily—” “Well.” “Why—a—foolish vanity, a—that is all—nothing more I assure you—I thought I might fall in with some of the pretty rustics—Ha, ha, ha! you understand me Smithson, my good fellow, ha?—and so I borrowed this coat of an old acquaintance. You take, ha?” “D—n your gibberish,” muttered Smithson, and then added, in a tone of supreme contempt; “Yes, I understand.” From that moment, Mr. Smithson set down Mr. Anderson as one of the genus between the ourang outang and human. Whether the young man succeeded in blinding him altogether, was doubtful; but he made no further remark, and went into the house with the gorgeous uniform in his hands, and returned with a claret-colored coat, and nankeen waistcoat, which Andre put on, covering his head with a round hat, and wrapping himself again in his blue overcoat. In a few minutes the horses were ready, and mounting, they moved away from the house at a fast trot in the direction of King's ferry.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER EIGHTH. About nine o'clock the morning following these events, on a broad hill-side that swept from a ridge half a mile from the Hudson to its shores, and within sight of the village of Tarry-town, a foraging party consisting of three yeomen were seated on the ground beneath a tree, playing cards. The tree stood a little retired from a public road, which coming from the village below, wound across the face of the hill and disappeared over the ridge-towards the interior. Each of them had a powder horn and shot pouch slung over his shoulder, while a musket lay across the knees of one, and a rifle and long ducking-gun stood against a tree where apparently they had been placed by the others to leave them more at liberty to pursue their pastime. Although intent on their game, every few seconds they lifted their heads and took a keen survey of the road. “Trumps!” exclaimed one slapping the card down upon his brawney thigh. “Its your trick, John, by the livin' Jerusalem!” cried he with the musket. “Luck's agin me this mornin', boys,” said the third, a stout built jolly faced farmer, with a twinkle in his eye and a globular nose, on which was scored in carmine many a deep potation; “I'll into the road and see if I can't find some better luck with game of another sort.” “If you can light on one of them ere tory cow-boys, Ike, we are on the look out for, driving our yankee cattle to make beef for John Bull's carcase down in York, I'll give up every copper I've won on ye,” said the first speaker, a thin cadaverous looking man with long legs and long hair. “Then fork out Davy, for here comes a prize as good, or may I never take aim again at the sun with the butt-end of a quart-pot.” The men sprung to their feet, seized their guns and joined their comrade in the wood. “Whose cut and deal is this?” said the last speaker pointing up the road, along which a single horseman was advancing at the best speed he could get out of a jaded horse. At the period of which we write, there was a tract of country along the East bank of the Hudson between the American and British lines, called the Neutral ground, thirty miles wide. By a law of the State of New York any person was authorised to seize and convert to his own use, all horses, and cattle or beef that should be driven across it southward towards the British lines if it was taken within ten miles of these lines. The consequence was that the whole of the neutral ground was closely watched by the inhabitants, who sallied from their homes in small parties and waylaid the highroads; so that it was difficult for the cow-boys, whose occupation was stealing cows for the `lower camp,' to get with their booty safely across the debateable land. Stragglers, and all suspicious persons, were also stopped and made to give an account of themselves, and not unfrequently peaceful travellers were civilly invited to pay toll of a few dollars to some of these guardians of the roads, who were not over nice in their distinctions between those who drove horses and those who rode upon them. With this explanation the character of the party in question will be readily seen. “He's a gentlemen-like looking chap,” said he of the carmine nose who had been called Ike; “broadcloth and boots, and a heavy purse I'll warrant me.” “You're always thinking o' the purses, Ike,” said he of the long limbs; “I would'nt wonder if natur' had'nt gen ye a spice o' the foot-pad in your liver. Come, John, suppose you step out and speak to him,” he said, addressing the winner at cards, a substantial, respectable-looking young farmer, “if Ike does it, it will be like your regular banditty, one o' your touch and go. We must stand by the honor o' the country at all odds.” The one addressed stepped in advance of his comrades towards the horseman, who was looking as he rode, earnestly towards a vessel of war some miles off on the river, and did not see the man until he came within twenty paces of him, when he suddenly checked his horse; the next instant he spurred him on as if he would pass him at full speed, reined him up before the glittering bayonet levelled at his chest, and then, making a demi-volte across the road buried his spurs deep and would have dashed past, but the cool yeoman caught the animal firmly by the nostrils and checked him so suddenly as to throw him backward nearly upon his haunches. “It was well done, sir,” said the yeoman, “no doubt you are in a hurry, but then we want to become a little acquainted with you before you travel further. The times are out of joint and we know not true men from bad.” The stranger was enveloped in a blue great coat buttoned to the neck, with nankeen breeches and military boots and an ordinary black hat; and had that indescribable air and manner that betrays under the meanest disguises the gentleman and soldier. “Gentlemen,” he said, in a collected manner as the rest of the party came up, “I hope you belong to our party.” “Which party?” asked the first. “The lower party.” “Aye, aye, that we do, don't we Davy?” said the knight of the carmine. “To be sure! what else does the gentleman think?” replied he of the long hair, winking at his fellow. “I am glad to learn it,” replied Major Audre, whom the reader has already recognized. From Smithson's house he had crossed King's ferry and ridden southward along the eastern side under the guidance of Smithson, and only dismissed him a few miles back when he entered the neutral ground, where he considered himself comparatively secure. From the top of the ridge above alluded to, he descried the Vulture a few miles above where she had anchored beyond the fire of the American batteries. It occurred to him that he might get some one to take him on board from the village, whereby he should be saved the fatigue and danger of a long ride of ten miles to the British lines. His spirits hitherto depressed by the loneliness of the road and extreme peril of his situation, became elevated at the prospect, and urging his horse forward he found himself all at once in the midst of an ambuscade. “Gentlemen,” he continued. “I am gratified to know that you are friends, for I am a British officer absent from New York on particular business, and I beg you will not detain me, suspecting me to be other than I say I am.” As he spoke he drew from his pocket a richly chased gold watch and anxiously consulted it. “Aye, aye, Paulding, he's a Britisher by his yeller gim-cranks,” said carmine; “we Yankees are too pesky poor to have sich gear—General Washington himself only fobs a silver turnip.” “You must dismount, sir,” said the sturdy yeoman sternly. “My God! I must do any thing to get along my good fellows! Here is General Arnold's pass, that, perhaps, you may respect if you do not a British officer.” “Dismount, sir, and we will read it,” said Paulding, who still held the horse by his nostrils. “We have no idea of letting you escape till we know your business.” “Hold on like grim death to a dead nigger, John,” said Ike of the nose, as the horse grew restive under the gripe; “gold watches don't grow in every body's corn-patch.” “Gentlemen, you had best let me go or you will get yourselves into trouble. Examine this pass. Be brief! for I have been too long detained already.” “I cannot read it till you dismount,” said Paulding, holding the closed paper in one hand. Andre sprung lightly from the saddle to the ground, when the yeoman released his gripe on the horse, passed the bridle beneath his arm, and opened and read the passport. “I hope you'll not be offended, sir,” he said, with the air of respect, which he had hitherto preserved, notwithstanding his resolute manner, “but there are spies and other dangerous people abroad, and I only want to know if you are a true man. If you are proved to be, why there is no harm done, if you ain't why—.” “Then we'll have have his watch on shares, and pull straws for the chain,” said Isaac. “The name in the pass is Anderson, is it yours, sir!” “It is. Let me go and I will give you my watch, horse, saddle and bridle.” “Your anxiety and your offer leads me to suspect you. Here is General Arnold's signature—that is all right enough, and we would let you pass with it, if you had not just now called yourself a British officer.” “Considerable suspicious!” said he of the hair. “He's a regular circumstance—and no mistake,” said carmine, fumbling about his waistband for a fob that the sagacious tailor had prophetically constructed therein. “Let's search him!” “Aye, that'll show what's trumps!” said the knight with the legs. “There is no alternative,” said Paulding; “you must excuse us, but it must be done, sir.” Leading him into the wood they proceeded to examine his hat, coat, and waistcoat, without making any discovery. At length they compelled him to resign every article of his apparel to their scrutiny. He of the long locks pulled off his boots, while Ike opened his watch and examined the case. Their search was vain, and he was directed to resume his apparel, when Paulding thought he heard a rattling like paper as Andre drew on his boot. His fine thread stockings alone had not been taken off, the captors satisfying themselves with passing the hand along the outside of the calf and ancle. “Mr. Anderson, you will oblige me by removing your stockings,” said the vigilant yeoman. “I had thought this foolish search was ended,” said the young man, his heart sinking. “Your stockings must come off, sir.” “Take them off,” said Andre, placing his palm on his brow, and turning away his face, wrung with an expression of the keenest anguish. In the feet were discovered the fatal pacquets given him by General Arnold. A glance at the contents of one or two of the papers at once gave them an idea of their importance and dangerous nature. After they had consulted together for a few minutes as to the disposal of their prisoner, he who was called Ike approached Andre, aud said: “Now what'll you give us to let you go free?” “Any amount of money you may ask,” was the eager reply “Will you give me your watch and chain, and these gentlemen your horse, saddle, bridle, and a hundred guineas told?” “Cheerfully. And the money shall be directed to this very spot if you say so, so that you shall be sure to get it.” “Is that all you will give?” coolly asked Paulding. “I will give you whatever you demand, goods or money to the amount of a thousand pounds.” “Now, mister,” said he of the nose, in a patriotic tone, and with a look of inconceivable magnanimity. “if you'd give us ten thousand guineas, and your watch to boot, yes, your gold watch and chain, to boot, we would not let you stir a step. Hey, boys?” “If he's an enemy, poor as we be, I'd rather be without the money than he should escape to do mischief,” responded Davy. “Would you escape if you could,” asked Paulding. “Most assuredly.” “I don't intend you shall,” was the quiet reply of the American. In a few minutes afterward they directed their prisoner to remount his horse, and with Paulding leading the animal by the bridle, and the two others marching one a few paces in advance, and the other in the rear, they reentered the road, and moved at a smart pace northwardly towards North Castle, the nearest military post of the Americans.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER NINTH. On the eastern bank of the Hudson, two miles southwesterly from West Point, there stands, at the present day, a time-worn dwelling. It is a long, rambling structure, two stories high, and erected apparently at different periods—a low gallery, in some places sunken, runs around it, with vines creeping about its slender columns, and grass growing in its crevices; shrubs have got roothold on its moss-covered roof and hang over the eaves in graceful festoons. It is in the centre of a lawn, from the bosom of which, numerous fine old trees of a century's growth, send up their trunks to a great height, and form a broad canopy of foliage above the venerable roof. Every thing about it—its worm-eaten fences; its thick soft grass, like piled-velvet, which age on ly can give; its long range of noble old barns, once red, but now browned and blackened with the storms of eighty winters; its gigantic shrubbery; an avenue of box trees that look as if planted under a woman's eye ere the Revolution, all give it an air of old family dignity and antiquity that is seldom found in this young western world. A forest shuts out the prospect of the river from the south gallery, but a range of mountains, Dunderbeg and his satellites, fill the eye instead, while Antony's Nose, clothed with trees to its top, rises abruptly from the lawn, which is blended with its base to the height of a thousand feet. On the west and north, Fort Putuam, now nearly hid by the trees that have been suffered to grow up immediately around it, and old Crow Nest, are striking objects in the prospect. From the bouse a winding carriage road leads through a romantic wood to a small cove in the Hudson, near the outlet of a brawling brook which intersects the grounds, where is a landing place for small boats. This is called Beverly Cove, and the dwelling above described Beverly House. Here Arnold held his head quarters during his command at West Point. In a large, square room of the mansion, its low ceiling intersected by transverse beams, carefully white-washed, the capacious fire-place flanked by panel-work and little closets, with but a single door (besides that opening into the hall) leading into a small room lighted by a single window looking to the north, there sat, the morning after Andre's arrest, a party at breakfast. It consisted of General Arnold, who was in an unusually gay and social vein, his youthful and lovely wife, whose maiden charms had won the admiration of Andre,* * It is a singular fact that Andre was an admirer of Miss Shippen, afterwards Mrs. Arnold, who was a daughter of Chief Justice Shippen, of Philadelphia, where he first saw her during its occupancy by the British army. and Colonels Hamilton, and McHenry, aids-de-camp of General Washington and La Fayette. In the midst of their meal, and an animated conversation on the subject of the contemplated attack on New York, a horseman rode up to the door, and a moment afterward an orderly entered the room with a note, which he gave to General Arnold. Putting down an egg he was about to break into a little china cup 3 before him, he opened the letter and read with a palpitating heart and a sensation of suffocation: “Sir:—I send forward, under charge of Lieutenant Allen and a guard, which will arrive at Beverly House by noon, a certain John Anderson, who had been taken while going towards New York. He had a passport signed in your name, which doubtless, is forged, and a parcel of papers, taken from his stockings, which are of a very dangerous tendency. I send him to you as commanding officer, feeling that it is a case presenting too many difficulties, and involving too much for me to decide upon. Jamieson, Colonel, &amp;c. &amp;c. Till this moment Arnold believed that his treason was successful. From the hour of his arrival at Beverly House, after taking leave of Andre, he had been singularly active and alert in all his duties, and with the officers about his person was on more than usual terms of confidence and intimacy. That morning Colonels Hamilton and McHenry had rode forward to his house from Fishskill to announce the approach of Washington and La Fayette to dine with him. Such was the confidence this great man reposed in him—alas, how repaid! The friendship (which he had) of such a man as Washington; the moral atmosphere he diffused around him, should have saved him from so great a fall! With an effort of self-command almost supernatural, he read the information of the capture of Andre and the defeat of his plans, so long forming. He folded the letter, suppressing his emotions the while, so effectually as to prevent the least suspicion of the occurrence of any extraordinary event, and taking up the egg he laid down, deliberately broke it into the cup, and for a few seconds longer continued to eat his breakfast, and addressed with ease a few common-place words to Colonel Hamilton. At length he said: “Gentlemen, I beg you will not let my departure interrupt your meal. I have just received a note requiring my immediate presence at West Point. George, have my horse immedlately saddled and brought to the door. Then rising from the table he hastened up stairs to his private room, situated at the northeast corner of the house, and despatched a servant to the breakfast room to say to Mrs. Arnold that he desired to speak with her. “Mary,” he said, in a voice of the deepest agitation, closing the door, and taking her in his arms, “we have been united but eighteen months, but we must now part forever. I have been, unknown to you, engaged in a treasonable correspondence with Sir Henry Clinton. The note I have just received tells me of the arrest of his messenger to me, with papers on his person, either of which would become my death warrant. Nothing remains for me but instant flight to the enemy. My barge is at the landing. I can reach the Vulture by noon. Escape now will be easy. No one here is yet aware of my criminality. An hour hence it will be too late. Though Jamieson is too dull to suspect me, Tallmadge or others may ere this have seen the papers and be on their way to arrest me. Instantly burn all my papers. Now, farewell, dearest. God bless you. The heaviest blow this inflicts will reach me through you. Now, God bless you—bless you!” Hastily embracing her he fled from the apartment, and though a shriek, prolonged and wild, and a heavy fall reached his ears as he descended the stairs he lingered not, but flung himself on Col. Hamilton's horse, his own not being yet at the door. Giving the animal the rein, he took a by-path around the stables, galloped along a hedge, and descended a wooded hill through a dry rocky ravine, almost impracticable to horse, but down which he recklessly urged the noble animal, which, by plunging, leaping, and sllding on his belly, the spurs of the rider cutting into the rocks as he bore upon them with his heels, reached the bottom, and leaped the brook clear into the carriage road. Riding forward like wind through the wooded bottom, Arnold gained the cove, where, beside a small pier, his barge, with six men, was in waiting to convey him as usual, at that hour, across to West Point. He threw himself from his horse and sprung into the boat. “Push off, Cuyler!” he said to the coxswain, with anxious impatience. “Lively, men, lively! Clear from the shore! Set your oar to that sunken rock, and help her! There, she's off. Thank God! Now let her fall and give way. Starboard, Cuyler! Hard a starboard!” The boatman stared. “Are we not going to West Point, sir?” “No, below! Urgent affairs require my presence on board the Vulture. Pull out into the middle of the river and take the full force of the tide. Lay to your sweeps well, men. You shall have a guinea a piece when you run your boat under the counter of the Vulture. The men gave utterance to a kind of cheer, and bent to their oars with a good will. Cuyler sat in the stern sheets, steering her with a steadiness and skill that added almost the force of a seventh oar to her speed. For awhile the barge stood steadily down the river, passing on either hand scenery of savage grandeur, every commanding eminence of which was frowning with a redoubt. In about an hour they emerged from the Highlands into a broader part of the river, and approached the fortress at Verplanck's Point, commanded by Colonel Livingston. Arnold, who hitherto had sat in the stern of the boat, with his arms folded, only rousing himself from a gloomy reverie by cheering the boatmen to renewed exertions, on nearing the post placed in the stern a white handkerchief fixed to his sword, which had the effect intended, for Col. Livingston regarding it as a flag-boat, permitted it to pass without ordering it to be stopped and examined. This was a trying moment to the traitor, and he scarcely breathed till the barge was beyond gun-shot. The Vulture was now in sight a league below, and in another hour he was on board of her. We will here dispose of the traitor in a few words. Although his plan had failed, he was made a Major-General in the British army, and was otherwise rewarded for his intentions and previous services as Clinton's correspondent. But honorable men of the British army refused to associate with him, and officers to serve under him. After living twenty years in merited contempt and infamy, he died, miserably, at his residence, in Grosvenor square, London; not only unpitied and unhonored, but leaving behind him a name which has become a by-word for treason among both the British and American people.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER TENTH. Two hours after the flight of Arnold, General Washington, accompanied by Knox and La Fayette, on their return from a visit to Count Rochambeau at Hartford, arrived at Beverly House, as previously arranged, to repose themselves and dine. Here learning from his aids that General Arnold had been suddenly called over to West Point on urgent business, he remained only long enough to take a late and hasty breakfast, and hastened to the garrison to ascertain if anything important had transpired. Accompanied by all his suite except Colonel Hamilton, who was detained in writing letters, he rode to the cove by the usual carriage road. This is a firm gravelled avenue, running northwardly with an easy descent, through a line of old trees for a hundred yards, to the bottom of a dell, through which the brook before mentioned runs brawling over stones. Here, at a gate, the road makes a sharp angle to the left, and follows the course of the rivulet. A roof of densest foliage shields it from the noon-day sun, and seats placed at intervals along its borders, invite the rambler to repose; while the ceaseless gurgle of the flowing water, the singing of countless birds, the silence of the forest trees, save when their tops are moved whisperingly by the winds, tempt him to linger in its delightful seclusion. Such was the pleasant woodland path through which the party rode, such, save that time has made it lovelier, is it now. Just before they arrived at the cove they discovered the horse deserted by Arnold grazing by the path, his bridle beneath his feet, and his saddle and coat bearing traces of the red soil in which he had taken that equine luxury, a roll. A passing remark was made by Knox on General Arnold's carelessness; the animal was led back to the house by a servant; and in a few seconds afterward the gentlemen dismounted on the little pier. Here a small penant hoisted by an attendant sent in advance, was fluttering from a staff placed on a projecting point of rock, in answer to which a barge of eight oars was putting out from the fort of Buttermilk Falls, then a military station. In a few minutes the party embarked, and the boat moved swiftly through the water. The harmony of motion and action in a well manned barge, produces, like all harmony, silence and musing. The simultaneous sway of the bodies of the oarsmen—the regular rattle in the rowlocks—the liquid dip of the falling sweeps— the answering leaps of the boat, all are harmonious, soothing, and conducive to meditation. After the first hundred yards conversation ceased, and each gentleman seemed to be occupied with his own thoughts. The scenery through which they moved, added also, its influence. On the right, stretched the eastern shore rising a rocky precipice from the water, and crowned with woods. On the left, the Buttermilk Falls came tumbling and foaming in snowy sheets from the top of a cliff, and further on the shores were walled with lofty rural precipices. As they proceeded, the Highlands of Crow Nest and Bull Hill frowned down upon them, and from a promontory the fortress of West Point bristled with its iron battery. As they approached the landing, now disused, south of Kosciusco's garden, Washington observed with enthusiasm: “Well gentlemen, it is fortunate for us that General Arnold has gone over to the garrison in advance of us, for we shall now have a salute, and the roaring of the cannon will have a fine effect among these mountains.” The barge continued to approach the shore without any notice from the fortress, when, surprised at the silence, and absence of all preparations to receive them, he exclaimed,— “What! do they not intend to salute us?” An officer now made his appearance descending the ravine, and reached the shore just as the boat touched it. “How is this, sir?” said Washington, with some severity. “Pardon me, General,” said the officer in confusion, “I did not anticipate the honor of such a visit, or I should have been prepared to receive you in a proper manner.” “What! is not General Arnold here?” demanded the chief with surprise. “No your excellency. He has not been here for these two days, nor have I heard from him, within that time.” “This is extraordinary, indeed,” said Washington, “we were told he had crossed the river and that we should find him here.” He, nevertheless, remained and inspected the garrison and works, and then, reentered the barge with his suite, and was pulled back to Beverly House. As he approached the mansion Colonel Hamilton met him with a troubled countenance and whispered in his ear; “Alight, sir! I have a matter of the most vital importance to acquaint you with.” Washington accompanied him into the sitting-room and when the door was closed, Hamilton placed in his hands several papers, saying, “as the messenger who arrived with these shortly after you left, said they were of the utmost importance, I opened them.” Washington read the letters which contained from an authentic source, the account of the capture of Andre and a copy of the papers in Arnold's hand-writing with the passport in the same hand, found on his person. The guilt of Arnold was made clear as light, and the cause of his absence from West Point accounted for. It was plain that he had escaped to the enemy. “He has descended the river, ride Hamilton for your life,” said Washington, “it may be possible to intercept him at Verplanck's Point.” Colonel Hamilton left the room and spurred away on what proved to be a fruitless errand. Washington now sent for Generals LaFayette and Knox to whom he communicated Arnold's treason, and placed in their hands the papers which confirmed it. His manner was composed and dignified. “Whom can we trust now!” he said calmly, after they had finished the perusal of the letters. “Mon dien! is it possible?” exclaimed LaFayette, crumbling the paper in his clenched hand as he swiftly paced the apartment. “I always knew him to be a disaffected man, but by — I did not expect the devil to turn out so black from hoof to horn!” said Knox, violently striking his fist on the table. “It is useless to show feeling about it now, gentlemen,” said Washington, without betraying emotion or anxiety of any kind, “it remains for us to repair what injury he has done us, and prevent him from doing more.” The American General now directed all his energies to counteract the plans laid by the traitor. Orders were forwarded to all the posts, the position of the garrison changed and the whole order of things as laid down by Arnold reversed. Sir Henry Clinton however, through the capture of Andre, was kept in ignorance and uncertainty until the arrival of the Vulture in New York with Arnold on board, the morning after his flight. The project therefore, was abandoned and the troops disembarked.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER ELEVENTH. It was not until noon on the following day that Andre arrived at Beverly House under escort of Major Tallmadge. This officer on inspecting the captured papers which were shown to him after Col. Jamieson had sent the prisoner forward, saw what this officer was strangely blind to, Arnold's guilt. Expressing in warm terms of censure his opinion of the course pursued by Jamieson of sending the accomplice to the accomplice, he requested and received the command of the escort, and after some delay reached head-quarters with his prisoner. Washington refused to see him lest he should forget what was due to justice in sympathy for its victim, and ordered him to be placed under guard in the small room, opening from the dining-room, a sentinel to be posted on the outside of the door, and other precautions taken for his security until he could be conveyed to West Point and thence to Tappan for trial. It was late in the afternoon when Andre stood by his little window watching the setting sun as it hung low in the skies above the summit of Crow Nest, and gilding with its slanting beams the walls of the fortress at West Point. His thoughts were turned on the hopelessness of his situation. He knew that he must die. To be cut off in the prime of his youth, his earthly hopes crushed, the ties of love, paternal and filial, forever broken, all that bound him to his fellow-beings severed and destroyed! He turned away from the window and paced to and fro his narrow prison under the pressure of intense mental agony. Terrible was the conflict between his manhood and his human nature! At length reason asserted her power, and philosophy and religion came to his aid and he grew calmer. He resolved to bear his fate like a man and like a British soldier. After a few seconds he called to the sentinel and requested writing materials to be brought to him. They were cheerfully granted by Major Tallmadge, who had taken a deep and feeling interest in the fate of the noble youth. Seating himself at a table, Andre penned the following letter to General Washington: 24th September, 1780. “Sir:—What I have said concerning myself to my captors was in the justifiable attempt to be extricated; I am too little accustomed to duplicity to have succeeded. I beg your excellency will be persuaded, that no alteration in the temper of my mind or apprehension for my safety, induces me to take the step of addressing you; but that it is to rescue myself from an imputation of having assumed a mean character for treacherous purposes or self-interest; a conduct incompatible with the principles that actuate me, as well as with my condition in life. It is to vindicate my fame that I speak, and not to solicit security. The person in your possession is Major John Andre, Adjutant General to the British army. The influence of one commander in the army of his adversary is an advantage taken in war. A correspondence for this purpose I held; as confidential (in the present instance) with Sir Henry Clinton. To favor it I agreed to meet upon ground not within the posts of either army, a person who was to give me intelligence; I came up in the Vulture man-of-war for this effect, and was fetched by a boat from the ship to the beach. Being there, I was told that the approach of day would prevent my return, and that I must be concealed until the next night. I was in my regimentals, and had fairly risked my person. Against my stipulation, my intention, and without my knowledge beforehand, I was conducted within one of your posts.— Your excellency may conceive my sensation on this occasion, and will imagine how much more I must have been affected by a refusal to reconduct me back the next night as I had been brought. Thus become a prisoner, I had to concert my escape. I quitted my uniform, and was passed another way in the night without the American posts, to neutral ground, and informed I was beyond all armed parties, and left to press for New York. I was taken at Tarry-town by some volunteers. Thus, as I have had the honor to relate, I was betrayed (being an Adjutant General of the British army) into the vile condition of an enemy in disguise within your posts. Having avowed myself a British officer, I have nothing to reveal but what relates to myself, which is true on the honor of an officer and a gentleman. The request I have to make to your excellency, and I am conscious I address myself well, is, that any rigor, policy may dictate, a decency of conduct towards me may mark, that though unfortunate, I am branded with nothing dishonorable, as no motive could be mine but the service of my king, and as I was involuntarily an impostor. Another request is, that I may be permitted to write an open letter to Sir Henry Clinton, and another to a friend for clothes and linen. I take the liberty to mention the condition of some gentlemen at Charleston who, being either on parole or under protection, were engaged in a conspiracy against us. Though their situation is not similar, they are objects who may be set in exchange for me, or are persons whom the treatment I receive might affect. It is no less, sir, in a confidence of the generosity of your mind, than on account of your superior station, that I have chosen to importune you with this letter. I have the honor to be with great respect, sir, Your Excellency's most obedient, And most humble servant, John Andre, Adjutant General.” When he had finished penning this eloquent appeal, he gave it to Major Tallmadge who read it with undisguised astonishment. He had suspected from his carriage and the habit of turning on his heel in his walk, that he was a military man, but he had no suspicions that he held so high a rank in the British army, nor that the plot in which he had been connected with Arnold was so extensive and dangerous. He carried the letter to General Washington, who was deeply affected on reading it, but made no reply to it. After the prisoner had sent the letter, his mind appeared relieved and his features wore a calm and contented expression. He turned again to the window, and the calm landscape lighted by the evening sky was not more placid and serene than his countenance. “Andre!” He started and looked around. But there was no one present. “Andre!” was a second time repeated, as if close to his ear, in the gentle tones of a woman's voice. He looked around and up to the ceiling, when his eye caught a slip of paper fluttering through a crevice in the floor above. “Andre,” softly repeated the voice a third time, and the paper fell fluttering at his feet. He lifted it from the ground and read with a sparkling eye: “Dear Major Andre:—Though miserable myself I cannot be altogether so absorbed in my own wretchedness as to forget the griefs of others. Listen to me. I know your high notions of honor and the spirit of chivalrous self-sacrifice that fills your bosom, but oh! for my sake—for your own—for that of your mother and sisters—for the sake of your country—do what I am about to ask of you! Accept life while it is in your power! Do not remain to die like a criminal! Life is now yours—to-morrow it may be due to justice! Alas! my heart tells me what will be your reply—but I will not therefore cease my exertions to save you. Assisted by a faithful slave, I this morning loosened two of the planks in your room. They afford communication with the cellar. Descend into it and Peter will meet you with a disguise, and conduct you, by the western outlet, which opens among high shrubbery, into the garden, where he will conceal you till night, and then provide a boat for your escape. Do not, Andre, neglect this opportunity! Fly now! General Washington and his staff are busy in the library, and nothing can prevent the success of the plan but your own obstinacy. Fly, Andre! Escape! For the sake of all you hold dear on earth losse not a moment, but fly! Mary.” The young man read this appeal with a sparkling eye and glowing countenance, when he concluded it he glanced upward and kissed his hand to the invisible author of it, then folded the paper, placed it next his heart, and paced the room rapidly with a thoughtful brow and excited manner. “Nay, nay, I will not—I cannot—I may not! I must abide my destiny.” He stopped, surveyed the floor through every part, and then walked towards the side next to the hall and trod lightly on the two planks nearest the wall. They were loose. He stooped to lift them and they yielded to his hand and he gazed down into the dark cellar beneath. “Come, massa! coas' clear—dis jus' de time!” said a low husky voice from beneath. The prisoner paused an instant, then with a sudden impulse closed the aperture and walked resolutely away. An exclamation of anguish and disappointment from the apartment above reached his ear, but with folded arms and a composed manner, he gazed steadfastly from the window, his face expressive of the triumph of an honorable mind over an unworthy temptation.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">24th September, 1780. “Sir:—What I have said concerning myself to my captors was in the justifiable attempt to be extricated; I am too little accustomed to duplicity to have succeeded. I beg your excellency will be persuaded, that no alteration in the temper of my mind or apprehension for my safety, induces me to take the step of addressing you; but that it is to rescue myself from an imputation of having assumed a mean character for treacherous purposes or self-interest; a conduct incompatible with the principles that actuate me, as well as with my condition in life. It is to vindicate my fame that I speak, and not to solicit security. The person in your possession is Major John Andre, Adjutant General to the British army. The influence of one commander in the army of his adversary is an advantage taken in war. A correspondence for this purpose I held; as confidential (in the present instance) with Sir Henry Clinton. To favor it I agreed to meet upon ground not within the posts of either army, a person who was to give me intelligence; I came up in the Vulture man-of-war for this effect, and was fetched by a boat from the ship to the beach. Being there, I was told that the approach of day would prevent my return, and that I must be concealed until the next night. I was in my regimentals, and had fairly risked my person. Against my stipulation, my intention, and without my knowledge beforehand, I was conducted within one of your posts.— Your excellency may conceive my sensation on this occasion, and will imagine how much more I must have been affected by a refusal to reconduct me back the next night as I had been brought. Thus become a prisoner, I had to concert my escape. I quitted my uniform, and was passed another way in the night without the American posts, to neutral ground, and informed I was beyond all armed parties, and left to press for New York. I was taken at Tarry-town by some volunteers. Thus, as I have had the honor to relate, I was betrayed (being an Adjutant General of the British army) into the vile condition of an enemy in disguise within your posts. Having avowed myself a British officer, I have nothing to reveal but what relates to myself, which is true on the honor of an officer and a gentleman. The request I have to make to your excellency, and I am conscious I address myself well, is, that any rigor, policy may dictate, a decency of conduct towards me may mark, that though unfortunate, I am branded with nothing dishonorable, as no motive could be mine but the service of my king, and as I was involuntarily an impostor. Another request is, that I may be permitted to write an open letter to Sir Henry Clinton, and another to a friend for clothes and linen. I take the liberty to mention the condition of some gentlemen at Charleston who, being either on parole or under protection, were engaged in a conspiracy against us. Though their situation is not similar, they are objects who may be set in exchange for me, or are persons whom the treatment I receive might affect. It is no less, sir, in a confidence of the generosity of your mind, than on account of your superior station, that I have chosen to importune you with this letter. I have the honor to be with great respect, sir, Your Excellency's most obedient, And most humble servant, John Andre, Adjutant General.”</field>

      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER TWELFTH. The morning of the second of October broke with a clear sky, and the promise of a bright autumnal day. The sun rose without a cloud and gladdened hill, forest, and valley, with his cheering light. Happiness was written on the face of nature as if written with the finger of Heaven; but among the inhabitants of men, sorrow and woe had, as ever, an abiding place. There was one abode into the windows of which this morning's sun shone, above all others, melancholy in its character, and most melancholy for the scenes of human sorrow and wretchedness of which it was the daily witness. It was a prison. In one of its gloomiest apartments, sat a young man whose days were numbered—whose star was about to become extinguished ere it reached the zenith. It was Major Andre. His judges had doomed him to die as a spy, taken within the American lines. The sympathising American Chief would gladly have commuted this harsh sentence, but military justice demanded the victim! In one hour he was to be led forth to execution! His countenance was firm. A delightful calm dwelt on his youthful and noble features, and an air of repose and resignation marked his bearings. About him stood a group of officers, foes of his country, but whom his virtues had converted into personal friends. Tears were in the eyes of these stern warriors, and their voices trembled with emotion as they talked in low tones with each other. He alone was calm and resigned! An officer entered and announced, in a subdued tone, that the hour of execution had arrived. The prisoner rose with dignity and said: “Gentlemen, I am ready to wait on you.” Taking the arm of Major Tallmadge, who had been constantly with him since his captare, he left his cell with a firm step. In the street he took the arms of two subaltern officers, and walked between them to the place of execution. A natural composure pervaded his manner and his whole deportment was remarkably dignified and self-possessed. “My emotions are singular,” he said, turning to Major Tallmadge, who walked near him, “when I reflect that in a very few minutes I shall be an inhabitant of the world of spirits—so soon have revealed to me the great secret! But I do not shrink from it. I am not afraid to die—if I were, wretched, indeed, should I be at this moment.” They now came in sight of a gallows surrounded by a large military force and a great concourse of citizens awaiting the event—a deep gloom filling all hearts—commiseration visible on every face. When the young man saw the degrading instrument of execution he stopped, and turning to Major Tallmadge said, with an expression of mingled pain and indignation, “Why is this?” “Are you ill, sir,” asked the officer, ignorant of the cause of his emotion. “Tis nothing, sir,” said the young soldier, recovering his composure; “I hoped to have met death at least at the hands of soldiers, and not at those of the common hangman. Move forward, I am reconciled to death, but I detest the mode.” In a few minutes afterwards he stood beneath the gallows. As he looked up at the fatal engine of death, his chest heaved and there was a choaking in his throat as if he were striving to suppress feelings struggling to escape. At length the noose was suspended from the beam and the wagon placed beneath. Without assisteace he stepped into it, and then for a moment he appeared to shrink. The ascendancy of nature was but momentary. Instantly recovering himself, he looked round upon the sorrowful faces at the foot of the gallows and said, with a smile: “It will be but a momentary pang.” Then, declining the assistance of the provost-marshal, he bandaged his own eyes with a degree of firmness and resignation that the eyes of all who gazed were filled with tears, and deep groans of emotion escaped from the breast of many a stalwart soldier, that the stern spirit of military laws should demand so young and noble a victim. The provost-marshal now loosely pinioned his arms and placed the noose over the young man's head, who, himself, with perfect firmness, adjusted it to his neck. “Major Andre, you have now an opportunity to speak if you desire it,” said the provost-marshal. Lifting the handkerchief from his eyes, he looked steadily around and said, in a firm, clear voice that reached every ear of the silent multitude: “I pray you bear me witness that I meet my fate like a brave man.” There was no vain boasting in his voice or manner, but his words proceeded from that honorable pride which becomes a soldier, and which sheds a halo even around the brow of death. When he had said this, he resumed his former position and calmly awaited his fate. The signal was given—the wagon rolled from beneath him, and the victim of military justice had expiated his offence with his life. “Such,” says Mr. Sparks in his `Biography of Arnold,' which able work we have made free use of in this outline, “such was the death of a man whose rare accomplishments had procured for him the friendship and confidence of all to whom he was known, and opened the happiest passages of a future career of renown and glory. In ten short days his blooming hopes had been blighted, and his glowing visions dispersed. But it was his singular fortune to die, not more beloved by his friends than lamented by his enemies, whose cause he had sought to ruin, and by whose hands his life was justly taken. Time has consecrated the feeling. There are few Americans, and few will there ever be, who can look back upon the fate of Andre without deep regret. His name is embalmed in every generous heart; and they who shall condemn his great error and applaud the sentence of his judges, will cherish a melancholy remembrance of the unfortunate victim, and grieve that a life of so much promise, adorned with so many elevated and estimable qualities, was destined to an untimely and ignominious end.” The tears and eulogies that have followed the memory of this noble gentleman, brave soldier, and honorable man, eminently show how virtue may ennoble even the gallows, and demonstrate that it is far better to die well, though on the gallows, than, like Bededict Arnold, to purchase life with the scorn and contempt of mankind. “Still lived he on—his victim doomed to die— Yet in their different fates behold the homily.”</field>
