      <field name="fulltext">THE TWO CLERKS, —OR, THE— ADVENTURES OF HENRY FOWLER AND RICHARD MARTIN. CHAPTER I. THE DEATH-BED. And who may feel a mother's woe, And who may read a mother's heart, And tell me why no tear may flow? —Allen. It was a bitter night in December. The wind howled round the streets and lanes of Boston, entering every crevice, and penetrating, with cutting severity, the frail abodes of poverty, making the shivering tenant draw closer round the dim fire, or crawl beneath the thin covering of his miserable bed. The rich felt it, too!—it swept down the Backbay, and whistled round the trees of the Common—it murmured hoarsely as it blew adown Beacon Street, and rattled the windows, and caused the vanes to creak.—Yes, the rich felt it,—but they felt it, as we perceive the acid in our food, only to enjoy the sweetness more. Stretched on their downy beds, or dozing over their sea-coal fires, they thought not of the houseless and the wanderer, or, if they did, 'twas but to mutter “Poor wretches,” and turn again to their downy slumbers. But the poor felt it—the famished—the dying—and every blast that rattled the windows of the North-end, struck like the chill of death to the heart of some houseless creature. The scanty fire sogged dismally on the cheerless hearth,—the last crust of bread lay untasted on the pine table,—the children had crept together and were folded in each other's arms, and ever and anon they cast fearful glances to the spot where, on a miserable bed, lay their sick and dying mother! A knock came to the door, and the children, with noiseless care, unfastened it. It was a poor but charitable neighbor, come to render the last offices of friendship to her dying friend. She bore in her hands a few simple delicacies, purchased with her own hard earnings, to tempt the appetites of the suffering children. Blessed Charity! when thou art banished from the rich and the powerful, thou art seen with the lowly and the poor, and when the glare of fashion and folly hideth thee, thou shinest forth in thine own light, by the dying bed of the world-forgotten: “Mary, are you better?” said Mrs. Martin, bending over the sufferer. The widow raised her eyes, and recognised the visiter. “Yes!” she murmured, “I am better—but—but—” and the mute look that she east at the trembling children, struck the heart of her friend, for she, too, was a mother. “I am not long for this world—but I dread not death. Mine has not been a flowery path—” “Nay, you are young,” said Mrs. Martin, “and your children—” “Yes, tis they—Oh, this is death's bitterness. Must I leave them without a father's care, a mother's watchfulness? Must I—” She cast one look at her children, who, clasped together, were seated by the dim fire. It was but one glance, but it was enough; it spoke whole volumes of sorrow, of doubt, of deep and dark regret; it told the whole misery of a mother's mind, the agony with which she thought of the last pang of separation—to leave them alone— alone—in a wide world of sin and misery. The eye of the good Samaritan followed the mother's glance—the workings of the mother's heart—and taking her thin white hand within her own, she called the children to the bedside; then, clasping the cold fingers of the orphans, she held them up, and, with a voice which the scene, the silence, and the deep heart-feeling, rendered peculiarly solemn and impressive, she spoke, “Mary, I am poor, and labor hard for bread,—but you have befriended me when I was friendless, and now, in the presence of the God who knows our hearts, I promise that, while my hands and strength are left me, your children shall have a home,—and I will be their mother.” The truthful sincerity of these tones, and the holy charity which beamed from her eyes, gave to the lowly woman, an appearance almost divine. The mother's features lighted up with a smile of peace and satisfaction. Her fingers closed firmly around the hand of her friend,—and she sank gently back to her last sleep, with the hope of a tranquil spirit. Mrs. Martin stooped over the body, from which the last breath had departed; then taking the hushed and wondering children by the hand, she sat down, and wiping her eyes with the corner of her coarse check apron, she addressed them,— “My children,”—but the good woman's tears flowed faster than her words, and the eldest child, a thin, sickly boy of twelve, comprehended, with the instinct of affection, the dreadful truth. Uttering a wild cry, he flung himself upon the bed, and throwing his arms around the neck of his dead parent, pressed his lips to hers. The awful chill of death struck fearfully through him, and he gazed wildly upon the corpse. The eyes were open, and fixed, but the smile still played on the lips, and he could not believe that it was death. His heart felt stifled and choked— deep sobs came thick and fast from his bosom, and he groaned in the bitter loneliness of his young soul. But no tear fell. He thought of all his past life. Every little act of disobedience, every slight,—all that he had done to wound his mother's heart, came with terrible distinctness before him. What would he not have given, if for one moment he could hear her voice, if she could speak but one word to him, to say that he was forgiven! He had not believed that she would die—he could not—and he had looked forward to that event as a thing afar off. But it had come; it was here in all the awful truth of reality; she was dead—dead, and he was alone in the world, for what would the world be to him without his mother? He hid his face in the scanty coverlid, and sobbed as if his little heart would break. His sister's grief was calmer; tears, soothing tears, came to the relief of her young spirit, and poured like rain down her cheeks; she buried her face in the bosom of the kind neighbor, and gave way to the sorrow that will not be comforted. And the kind-hearted woman was but little fitted to soothe her, for the tears streamed plentifully from her own eyes, as she witnessed the grief of the orphans. But the last rites must be performed, and the last offices of friendship rendered. With difficulty the sobbing boy was led from his mother's bed; for he clung to her body as if he still fancied life was there; and with his little sister he followed the friendly neighbor to her abode. It was humble enough; but the kindliness that makes a hovel seem a palace was there, and the children soon forgot in slumber the grief that was to come again, to-morrow, and to-morrow, for many a long day!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER II. THE ORPHANS. Forth on the world's wide sea, The storm of Fortune pelting at his bark, The haven yet unseen. —J. Browne. The next day the remains of the poor widow were committed to the earth, and the last duties performed by the charitable woman to her friend. To one in her situation this was a heavy expense. She knew that by bringing to her board the orphans, she must toil late and early to gain the means of living. She knew that her scanty means scarcely now enabled her to provide for her own two little ones, and that it would be long ere she could expect assistance from their labors. But Mrs. Martin's was not a mind to quail; she had not spoken hastily, nor without thought, when she had so solemnly promised her dying friend; she saw the difficulties of her situation, but should she desert the helpless orphans in their sore need,—should she let them be cast forth to the cold mercy of the world, while a grain of meal was in her barrel, or a drop of oil in her cruse? No! she resolved that her own children should suffer before she should neglect the holy trust committed to her. “And they will not suffer,” she said in her heart; “the God of the orphan and the fatherless will assist me, and enable me to perform my duty to the children of my friend.” There are many in the wide world like Mrs. Martin. But they are not found among the prosperous and wealthy; they move not in the glare of fashion, and in the gardens of luxury. No, they must be sought where they are—in the lowly abodes of poverty— among those who earn by the sweat of the brow, a hard fare and a harder pillow—among those whose love and charity are not blazoned forth in the eyes of the world, but whose deeds are written with the pens of angels, on the imperishable records of heaven. Mrs. Martin was a hard-working woman. She went daily forth to her duties, and scarcely earned, with all her industry, a subsistence for herself and children. But her heart was a kind and cheerful one, and whether bending over the wash-tub, or sitting in the evening at her quiet fireside, with her children around her, she was still the same loving, unrepining creature, with a wish to do more good than her means would ever admit of. Mrs. Martin's husband, formerly a pilot, had been lost in the terrible storm of 1816, and she had been left, with her two children, to procure a subsistence by the daily and laborious occupation of a washerwoman. A few months passed, and the orphan children had become reconciled to their new home, and ceased to miss the kind voice and look of their own dear parent. Mrs. Martin was, as she had promised, a mother, and more than a mother, to them; when she returned from her labors, and brought some little nick-nack to please the taste of children, the little strangers were always sure to have their share; and so solicitous was the good woman lest her natural affection might cause injustice, that the largest portion was often that of the orphans. Before the death of their mother, they had been constant in their attendance at the public school, and there still were they sent. And it would have joyed the heart of an angel to witness the pleasure that sparkled in the eyes of the good Mrs. Martin, when at evening they came around her and told her of the progress they had made. Her own children were too young to attend school, and it was the joy of the orphan boy, Henry Fowler, to teach them in the evening what he had learned during the day. And his sister, though scarcely nine years old, had already learned to take care of the youngest child—a bright little fellow of four years old—to make the fire, sweep the room, and the thousand little offices performed the more cheerfully, because not required.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER III. THE SCHOOLMASTER. But man—proud man! Dressed in a little brief authority, * * * * like an angry ape, Plays such fantastic tricks before high heaven, As make the angels weep! —Shakspeare. The school which Henry Fowler attended was the best public school in Boston, but unfortunately the teacher was a man, who, infected with the aristocratic notions, which too many of his class entertain, was unable to see, in the coarsely-clad orphan, aught of the talent so plainly discernible in the pupils whose parents possessed that grand desideratum—wealth. Consequently Henry, though applying himself closely to study, progressed but slowly in the ranks of his school. It was not supposed possible by the whitegloved preceptor, that a lad with such a jacket could by any means excel in learning. And poor Henry, instead of being aided and advanced in his laudable desire for improvement, was discouraged and impeded by the pride of one who should have been first to perceive and reward his real merit. When he had been a year or two at school an observer might have seen that something preyed upon his spirit. He had striven honorably and well for that place in the teacher's favor, which he saw open to his companions of less merit; and he met, for his endeavors, with but the sneer of scorn, or the mocking tones of distrust and pity. This had changed his character, totally and sadly changed it. When he entered the school, it was with buoyant hopes, and a resolve to be, what he fondly believed he could be, a faithful and successful scholar; and he was, as far as he could himself achieve it. But he had his fond trust nipped in the opening. When he hoped and expected approval, he met only neglect; where he sought to advance, he was repelled, and the heart that glowed with all the generous ardor of a young and trustful disposition, had been, in the space of two short years, changed by the mistaken views of one man, to a suspicious, distrustful, and unhappy one. This may not appear, but is, nevertheless, true, and the instances, even now, are by no means rare, when such are the effects of the ill-directed partiality of teachers in public schools. But if Henry Fowler possessed no friend in the master, he had gained many among his fellow-pupils, who, measuring him by his mind instead of his coat, soon learned to love and respect him. Among these was one named William Abbot, a frank, noble boy, blunt and quick in anger, but firm in his friendship. He was a lad who always called things by their right names, and judged of them not by their outward appearance, but intrinsic value. He was older than Henry, and, in a manner, took him under his protection; joined in his sports, and won his heart by those thousand friendly acts, which he mind of childhood understands and ap preciates. He was the son of a Kilby Street merchant, and of course was a favorite of the schoolmaster, a circumstance which, perhaps, made Henry less objectionable in the eyes of that dignitary. “William, why do you associate with that fellow?” asked a lad of about fourteen, clad in a bright-buttoned coat of green, his hair nicely parted, and his ruffle-collar falling gracefully over his neck, all betokening him one of the teacher's geniuses. “I should really think you would have more respect for yourself, than to be seen with such a dunce.” “A dunce, Frank Haywood?—you know better; who helped you in your lesson yesterday?” “Poh,” said the young gentleman, blushing up to his frilled collar, “he only showed me what I knew before. And he is a dunce, for the master says so, and he knows.” “Frank Haywood, you envy him, and that's all—and I should rather go with Harry Fowler any time, than be seen with a fellow who lies about him,” and William Abbot turned away. Haywood's blood mounted to his eyes, but he was afraid of William, and he bit his lips in silence. As William turned his back, however, so contemptuously upon him, he could bear no longer, and springing forward he struck him in the back, and at the same time, putting his foot in front, William fell upon the ground. But he had better provoked a lion—William was up in an instant, and pursuing the treacherous Haywood, overtook, and gave him a most righteous whipping, so that the discomfitted young aristocrat returned home with his ruffle wofully torn, his face ornamented with sundry scratches, and a most chopfallen expression of countenance. Such an occurrence could not be passed over unnoticed. The father of Frank Haywood was a retired merchant, very wealthy, and moreover, a selectman. And it was not to be expected that such an assault on his son would be passed unheeded by. Accordingly, the next day, during school hours, a thundering knock was heard at the door. The master opened it, and there, to his dismay, stood the wrathful Mr. Haywood, holding by the hand his dear boy, upon whose face sundry pieces of court-plaster, admirably disposed for effect, gave expression to otherwise rather blank features. The body of the pedagogue described the segment of a circle as he invited the great man in. “I am come,” said Mr. Haywood, raising his voice, in order that the school might hear how a selectman could speak—“I am come to know why—yes, sir—why—my boy—my son—yes, sir—has been shamefully maltreated and vilely abused—yes, sir—by one of your scholars, yes, sir!” Here the selectman stopped to breathe. “He shall be made an example of, sir,” said the schoolmaster. “But may I ask who was the delinquent?” “Ask my son, sir—yes, sir,” said the selectman. “It was Bill Abbot,” roared the interesting son. The face of the schoolmaster grew pale. “But, Francis, my dear, how did this happen,—eh, my boy?” “Why, I called Harry Fowler a dunce, and William—” “Ah, I see it—I see it all; Mr. Haywood, that boy, Fowler, has been more trouble to me—Yes, I see it. Fowler, come here, sir!” Henry rose from his seat, and walked towards the master's desk, wondering what new piece of injustice was to be performed. “Come here, sir; ask that gentleman's pardon, sir!” “For what,” asked Henry. “Ask his pardon!” “I won't!” said Henry, doggedly. “You shall,” said the pedagogue; “Abbot, step here,” and William came to the desk, “Fowler was the cause of your quarrel with Francis, yesterday, was he not, eh?” “Frank Haywood called him a dunce, and—” “There, Fowler, you hear that—now, sir, ask Mr. Haywood's pardon for causing this quarrel.” Henry hesitated; he knew that the master was not his friend, and he knew if he refused it would be considered rebellion. At his moment William Abbot whispered, “Don't do it, Harry, you're not to blame.” The schoolmaster bit his lip. “Will you obey me, sir?” “I will not ask his pardon!” “Then, sir, you are no longer a member of my school. Your refusal to obey me has destroyed all my confidence in you. I have long feared it would come to this. Take your books, sir—here, give me your copy book,” and the despotic teacher wrote, on a page of it—“expelled.” “Here is my writing book; you're a tyrant, and I'll tell my father to remove me from school!” cried the fearless William Abbot. The countenance of the master fell. “Mr. Haywood,” said he, apart to that official, “this boy, here, Abbot, is the son of S. Abbot, firm of Abbot &amp; Co., Kilby Street —you are aware, sir—his influence—eh, sir?” “Ah!” said the retired merchant, “Abbot &amp; Co.—yes, sir—S. Abbot. Sir, it is my opinion, the quarrels of boys are best settled among themselves—yes, sir. Good day, sir. I hope that my son does not associate with boys of this Fowler's class?” “No, my dear sir; he is a boy of much taste and discretion—hereditary, I think, sir.” “Ah!—I hope nothing unpleasant will occur again—yes, sir. Good day, sir,” and the gratified ex-merchant walked away, leading his hopeful son by the hand. “Fowler,” said the schoolmaster to Henry, who was placing his books in order, “Come here, sir.” Harry advanced a few steps towards the master's desk, then turned, and proceeded to pack his books. “Fowler, do you hear!” exclaimed the pedagogue. “I don't belong to this school, now, I believe,” said Harry, whose spirit was roused by the injustice he had experienced. The master saw his error; and he saw, too, that already the boys suspected the affair, and enjoyed his situation. He therefore left his desk, and walking to that of Henry, took up the copy-book, and drew his pen across the sentence of expulsion; then returning, he called again, “Fowler!” And this time Henry came. “Abbot,” said the teacher to William, who had all the time been standing beside the desk, inwardly exulting in Henry's spirit, “You see, I was mistaken in supposing Fowler to blame in this affair; you know I wish you both well, and I hope that you will preserve your temper, William, for it is very disgraceful to fight.” “He struck me in the back, like a coward,” said William. “I am very sorry it has happened,” said the repentant schoolmaster, “and I hope you will endeavor to agree better in future. And Fowler,” continued he, “you must not be too familiar with Haywood; you know,” said he, in a sneering tone, “familiarity breeds contempt.” William Abbot could have knocked the master down, but he said nothing; he merely looked at Henry, as if to tell him not to mind him. But Henry was too proud to care. “Now, boys, take your seats,” said the pedagogue, in an elevated tone. “First class, prepare to recite.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER IV. THE KILBY STREET MERCHANT. He was a man, take him for all in all, We shall not look upon his like again. A few days after this scene, poor Henry was called to witness another, far more harrowing. Mrs. Martin, the friend and benefactress of his childhood; she, who had watched and guided him, and his helpless sister, for three years, was laid low on the bed of pain, with few hopes of ever rising from it. The affliction of Henry was extreme; she had been to him more than a mother, and, but for her, he had long since been turned on the world, to battle with labor for his daily bread. But she never reproached him; and when, a year before, the orphan had expressed a desire to do something which would relieve her of the burden of his support, his request was received almost as an insult. “No, my boy,” said she, “go to your school—you will never regret it; but I shall, if I take you away. Go, and when my poor body is in the grave, you will bless the lowly widow's heart!” And Henry did bless her, many and many a time; and now, when he was called upon to resign her—when she was to be taken from the humble sphere of usefulness which she occupied—he felt again the bitterness of losing a friend—the second death of his heart. Again he would be left, without protection, to buffet the wild waves of the world's sea as he could; but he cared not for himself; the declining widow and her children, and his own dear little sister, claimed all his sympathies. But Providence never deserts the good; the charity of the poor widow was an enduring monument—and the God who witnessed it, would not abandon her helpless offspring to the miseries from which she had shielded another's. A friend now appeared, in the person of the father of William Abbot; and never came a friend more opportunely, and never came a kindlier one. Mr. Abbot was a man of high and honorable feelings, and therein his son resembled him. And our friend the schoolmaster knew this, when William threatened to inform him of the affair with Haywood. This may account for his desire to settle the difficulty amicably. But William was not deceived, and he, at an early period, related the circumstance to his father. The surprise of Mr. Abbot was extreme, for he had supposed that in a public school all who attended were considered, in point of rank, as equals. And that had been one reason why he had permitted William to attend it, rather than a private school; for, free from the vulgar vanity which would despise honest poverty, he wished his son should also be; and supposed that a school founded on the very principles of equality, would be the most suitable place to attain his object. He little knew the injury which an ill-directed mind placed in the situation of preceptor of a public school, could inflict. He little knew, that though no overt act of injustice might be done, a system of persecution could be carried on, calculated to break the proudest spirit—to dampen the most generous ardor. Nor had he reflected, that the conduct of the schoolmaster is the model which the pupils follow; that where vanity, and regard for extraneous things, is encouraged by the teacher, the scholars, apt in all things, will not fail to learn a lesson which will prove their bane and ruin. When, however, he had learned the truth, he resolved that his son should no longer be subjected to the influence of such a man; and accordingly removed him from the school. At the same time he expressed a wish to see Henry, for whom William had conceived such a friendship. William went at once to seek his friend. He found him at the bedside of his benefactress; she was extremely ill—indeed, it was apparent that she would not recover, and bitterly was the poor woman's heart wrung at the thought of leaving her children. But she trusted in God—that he would not desert her; and she looked back with satisfaction on the good she had done. William was deeply shocked at the sad scene. “Come with me, Henry,” said he; “my father must know this.” And the two friends left the house, Henry promising to return as soon as possible. When arrived at Mr. Abbot's, a splendid mansion in Collonade Row, William at once informed his father of the scene he had just witnessed, and Mr. Abbot requested a recital of the story from Henry. The orphan with a swelling heart related it. He told his own sad story; the generous conduct of the poor widow, and her untiring exertions in supporting and shielding the orphan children. He spoke of the poor woman's sorrow at leaving her offspring alone in the world, and concluded with— “But they shall never want; if I work day and night to support them, they shall never have it to say that Henry Fowler is ungrateful!” “You are a noble boy,” said the merchant, gazing with interest on the pale but animated countenance of Henry; “but you shall never work night and day; your friend shall not want, nor shall her children be deserted.” The good merchant then left the room rather cheerfully, and Henry thought he observed a tear to glisten in his eye, while William, taking his hand, cried, “There, Harry, I knew father would love you, so never fear; all will be well.” Mr. Abbot soon returned, and telling Henry he would call on the morrow, with Wil liam, kindly bade him good-bye, and Henry returned to the bedside of his benefactress, to convey the welcome tidings of a friend. “Blessed be God,” said Mrs. Martin, devoutly; “He deserts not the widow in her sore need!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER V. ANOTHER DEATH-BED. God keep thee from thy mother's foes, Or turn their hearts to thee; And when thou meet'st thy mother's friend Remember him for me —Burns. But we have almost forgotten the other orphan of our tale. Fanny, the little sister of Henry Fowler—but what was there in her quiet, guileless life, to chronicle? She was so young at the death of her mother that the change of homes could not affect her very deeply, and she soon found in her little playmates, the children of Mrs. Martin, new objects to love; and to love was, with her, to be happy. And by unnumbered acts of kindness and affection she knit the hearts of her little friends to herself. She was ever first in sporting with the young children, and in ministering by every little act of a loving spirit, to her dear mother, as she fondly called her benefactress. But if there was one thing more than another in the heart of the little maiden, it was a deep and abiding love for her brother. To her mind there was none in the wide world like him; none were so kind, so generous, so brave, so learned. Every little secret of her heart was confided to him; every little trouble sought in him a cure. Indeed, it was a strange and holy thing—the love which those two orphans bore each other. They seemed to realize that they were alone in the world—that they were all to one another. The love was entwined around their hearts like two interlocking tendrils of one vine, which might not be sundered but with death to both. Each was happy but in the joy of the other. The other children of the family, Richard and Charles Martin, were of entirely different dispositions. Richard, the eldest, was a reserved, suspicious boy, jealous of the least attention paid to another, which he did not share, and possessed of a revengful temper. Charles, on the contrary, was the counterpart of his mother—the same lovely, kindly disposition—studious of the good of others, and totally regardless of self. And of course he was the favorite of little Fanny; while Richard's disposition, as soon as it began to manifest itself, caused the little girl to shun him, instinetively, and bestow all her attention on her favorite. Nor was Richard more of a favorite with Henry; yet, strange to say, his mother seemed to love him better than his brother; it might be that he had the faculty of concealing his bad qualities from his doting parent; certain it is, that the mother manifested more affection for him than for the little bright-eyed, rosy, happy Charles. Mr. Abbot did not forget his promise. The next morning, accompanied by William, he came to the abode of Mrs. Martin. Nor did he merely come, as many do, to look on misery, depart, and come no more. He took active measures to smooth the poor woman's passage to the grave, and relieve her mind from all anxiety respecting her children. The story of Henry had enlisted all his sympathies in favor of the lowly widow, whose mite had been shared with the orphan and the fatherless. The youngest boy was already provided for by the kidness of a relation, who gladly welcomed his bright little face into the circle of her own children. Mr. Abbot had already offered to Henry a situation in his store, and he now resolved that Richard should also be admitted. None now remained but the sweetest one of all— the little Fanny; and a sister of Mrs. Abbot's, a resident of Newburyport, entreated that the dear child might be committed to her care; for she had been charmed with the simple truthfulness of the little maiden, and, having no children of her own, wished to adopt her. This was, if possible, a more severe trial to her brother, than to herself; to be separated, even for a little distance, and with even the prospect of seeing her often, from his only sister, seemed like tearing apart his heartstrings. But he knew it was for the best, and he manfully restrained his sorrow, and, wiping away the scalding tears that streamed fast from his sister's eyes, he bade her be of good heart and courage, and they would soon be united again. Poor child! she knew not how her brother could wish her to go, but she knew he wished it, and what he desired was to her a law—and she dried her tears, and resting her head on his bosom, mourned herself to sleep, in silent sorrow of heart. It was midnight. The candle burned dimly on the table; the dying embers shot forth a sickly light; and the wind howled around the frail tenement. Henry lay asleep on a bench by the fire; for he had become exhausted by continued watching, which nature could sustain no longer. The younger children slumbered in an inner room; and Richard sat at a table poring over “Rinaldo Rinaldini.” On a bed in a corner of the poor apartment, lay the sick mother; and at intervals the moans, that she struggled hard to repress, told of the agony she endured. The care of Mr. Abbot had supplied her with a nurse; but she had left the house, a short time before, to summon to the bedside a sister of Mrs. Martin, whom she had expressed a desire to see. Richard rose and approached the bed; his mother lay upon her side, and she raised her eyes to his face, with a faint smile. “Mother, it is time to take your drops.” “Stop, Richard,” said she, and taking from beneath her pillow a little key, she directed him to open a trunk beside the bed. He obeyed, and, at her indication, drew from it a small parcel. “Richard, my boy, I am dying! I shall not last till morning.” The boy seized her hand, and, while the tears gushed from his eyes, and his whole frame shook, cried, “Oh, no, no! mother! no, you will not die—” “Yes, my child' ” said Mrs. Martin; “but I shall die happy; the good Mr. Abbot has promised to take you under his care. Richard,” continued she, impressively, “remember the last words of your mother; fear God, my son; do on sin: never be guilty of a falsehood, never! and always do your duty to your master, and your God. And this packet—” said she, speaking with difficulty, “I hoped to have seen Mr. Abbot once more, —but this—when I am gone—take it—” Suddenly an awful change came over her countenance; she gasped for breath, and uttering a stifled cry, sank back upon the pillow. Henry sprung from where he had been sleeping, and rushed to the bed—Richard hastily concealed the packet. Mrs. Martin was in the agonies of death. Henry threw himself upon the bed beside her, and implored her to speak to him. Her lips half opened, and she strove for utterance; but in vain. The hand of the cold tyrant was upon her. But even in the pangs of dissolution, her eye shone with the joy of a Christian's hope, and her bright smile fell upon Henry, as if it were a glimpse of that heaven to which she was rapidly speeding. She grasped his hand, and placing within it the trembling fingers of Richard, seemed to consign her son to the care of the elder orphan. Then sinking back again on her pillow, she awaited, in silent resignation, the stroke of death. It was a sad thing to see those children watching by the bedside of the dying woman. They spoke not to one another, but listened fearfully to her short, quick breathings, and gazed wildly on her changing features. Suddenly, the breathing ceased—all was silent! Her slack hand embraced their own no longer, and a moaning cry broke from their bosoms, for they knew that death was among them!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER VI. THE CLUB SUPPER. Madly each reckless soul, Rushes to ruin in the brimming bowl! —Adams. Time passed on, and the boys continued in their occupation. But circumstances soon developed the character of each. Henry's studious disposition sought in the home of his employer the pleasure of his leisure hours. With his companion, William Abbot, he still pursued the studies commenced at school, and daily progressed in the attainment of knowledge. Richard, on the contrary, launched out into all the follies of the class to which he belonged. His was the heaviest cane that rattled in the pit of the Federal Street Theatre; his was the straitest ball on the Washington Garden alleys. Dick was a connoiseur in the art of good living— on a small scale. Probably it would have been a rich sight to a Washingtonian of the present day, to have seen the inside of a room of one of our crack hotels, one night in 1820, when the jolly W. R. C.—which, being interpreted, meaneth Wharf-Rat Club,—were met for a spree. A dozen youths, from fourteen to eighteen, seated round a table, on which the rosy wine and the steaming punches sent up their vapors to mingle with the smoke of cigars that rolled in circling clouds to the ceiling. Here, with his head placed in his neighbor's lap, reclined a young gentleman upon three chairs, with a brimming glass of flip, with which he was performing the praise worthy feat of drinking without putting his nasal organ in his tumbler. There, with his legs at an angle of forty-five degrees with his head, sat another, testing with a straw his powers of suction, upon a glass of whiskey-punch. At a side-table, four more were engaged in a game called whist, but the volleys of oaths and the shouts of laughter that came from them, evinced that it deserved aught but that title. At the head of the table, with a goodly array of glasses and bottles for a body-guard, sat Richard Martin, president of the W. R. C. Dick had striven hard and long for the high honor which he had now attained; a black eye, twelve bottles of wine, and a box of cigars, had been the price of the dignity, and the expense of electioneering. But it was gained—he was installed, and this was the election-spree. Dick was in his glory, and his wit poured out like the sparks from a black-smith's anvil. “Hip, hip, hurra!” “Hurra!—that's the ticket. Come, Dick, let's have a song!” “A song, boys; yes—hurra—a song; come Fred., you 're the poet-laureate. Strike up.” “Well, here goes!” SONG. Away with care and sadness, And welcome mirth and gladness! All sorrow is but madness— So, happy we will be! The man who's always whining, Sees not the sunbeams shining, Nor rosy wreaths entwining, Around his destiny! Then let us laugh, and let us quaff The gleaming, beaming wine, boys! Ay, merrily, merrily let us quaff The draught that is divine, boys! And let us sing, And cheerily, cheerily strive, From our bright ring, The monster care to drive! And laugh, and quaff, and merrily drink, And merrily, merrily drink Of the wine that's red, till the night is fled, And the rosy daylight shine, boys! Ay, merrily, merrily laugh, and quaff The draught that is divine, boys! “Well, now, that's what I call nice,” said a promising young man, dressed to the top of the fashion, as he stretched out his hand to the decanter. “It's wine that makes the verse run—hey, Dick” “Yes, I endorse that. By the way, boys, did you hear of my scrape with the Charlies the other night, eh?” “No—let's have it. Hurra for Dick Martin's scrape with the Charlies!” “Well, you see, boys,” said Dick, filling his glass, and casting a knowing look round the table, “I was going along Common street —let me see—yes! last club night — yes, that was the time—” “Never mind the time, Dick, let's have the story.” “Don't interrupt, gentlemen! I was walking along Common street, and just as I got to Brimstone corner—Jupiter! the tightest piece that ever I saw appeared before me. I gave chase, caught up with her, and peeped under her bonnet; she smiled; I said `good evening;' she smiled again. Says I, `my dear, shall I see you home?' and run my arm though hers. Blazes! she set up such a scream I thought the steeple would come down. I began to sheer off, when a Charlie (I suppose he had been asleep on Brimstone steps) placed his paw on my shoulder, and—” “What did you do?” “Do! why, damme! I stuck my fist in his mug—unclasped my cloak-collar, wound it round my arm, and streaked like lightning over the fence on to the Common.” “Chase you?” “Did he—yes! and the way he ground out the music warn't slow. There they were —half a dozen of them—after me, and I lining for the Back Bay. But just as I reached Charles street wall, damme, if a posse didn't start up, rattles, hooks, and all, to intercept me—I bolted over the wall into the burying-ground, and there I lay, snug as a bug—never catch a Charlie to enter a grave-yard!” “So you escaped, Dick?” “Yes!—But let's have another horn. There, you, Frank Block, where's that bottle I won of you at nine-pins?” “On hand, Dick—but let's finish the whiskey. Here, waiter, more cigarros— Life's but a joke—so drink and smoke, Let the world say what it will! For the rosy wine, and the girls divine, Are ours to toy with still!” “Fred., what will you have? wine?” “No, gin; that's the true and literal wisdom.” “How 's that, Fred?” “Why, nothing's plainer; wisdom is Minerva and gin is my nerver!” “Ha, ha, ha! a pun—kick him out!—ha, ha, ha!” A knock was heard, and the waiter entered— “A gentleman wishes to see Mr. Martin.” “Ask him—d—n it!—ask him, you booby—hullo! there, come in.” The door was thrown wide open, and, much to the president's discomfiture, Henry Fowler walked in. Dick was up in a moment, and, catching Henry by the arm, led him out and closed the door. “Richard, this is bad!” “Why you see, Harry, they 've elected me president of the society, and this is the election-supper: that's all, Harry.” “What society?” “Why—why—the—the—Boston Literary Society!” “Oh, is that all. Well, Richard, don't get into bad habits—you know Mr. Abbot's strictness. But what I came for is—that package, that I gave you to hand to Captain Jones; he has not received it.” “Oh, yes! I forgot, really! Harry, you won't speak to the old man, will you?—you see—” “No, no! never mind—I'll take charge of it. But don't be so negligent in future, Richard!” “Will you? you're a glorious fellow, Harry; mother always loved you—you're so kind—” “Well, no matter, Richard. Good night!” “Good night!” “Who the devil was that?” asked Fred. Johnson, as Richard returned. “A d—d pimping, prying fellow-clerk of mine—I'll smash his head some time! Hurra! boys! let's have another drink all round, and then, hey for the theatre. There's a new piece, and besides that—keep dark!— tight enough—I've seen her—just from New York. Show your bottoms, gentlemen!” “Drink!—hurra for Dick Martin!” Drink, drink, my boys, Drink, drink, my boys! Think not of the morrow!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER VII. THE BURGLAR. It is some evil business, then, That leads you from your home. Southey's, Eclogues.” The situation of Henry Fowler in the service of Mr. Abbot was a pleasant and happy one. Every day he received new demonstrations of his master's confidence and generosity. In the family, he soon became a favorite William Abbot still continued his friendship; and though separated from him, being at a distant boarding-school, pursuing his studies, many were the letters which passed between them. But with the sister of William, the bright little Lucia, Henry became an especial favorite. When he returned at evening from the store, she was the first to welcome him; and when the happy circle met around the social fire, the chair of Lucia, was drawn close to Henry's, and the maiden listened with rapt attention while he read from the stories of distant adventures, or recited the beautiful poetry he had himself learned to admire. Happy indeed was the orphan in the home of the Abbots. But it was destined to be fleeting— as what joy is not! Henry had been but a year in the store of Mr. Abbot, when he and Richard were advanced to stations in the establishment usually held by older and more experienced clerks. But their employer had the utmost confidence in their integrity; and as Richard Martin was not an inmate of his house, he was entirely ignorant of the habits which he had formed. Consequently the smooth tongue of Dick, and his punctual business habits, (for he never neglected his duties,) had the effect of concealing his true character from his unsuspecting master. A short time after Richard's “spree,” as he termed it, Henry was detained late at night at the counting room. He was engaged in copying letters which were to be despatched the next morning. The clocks of the town had pealed the hour of midnight; yet Henry still continued at his task. Suddenly he heard the lock snap in the inner store, and the door creaked on its hinges. Surprised he well might be, for he had been intrusted with the keys of the building, and even now they lay before him on the desk. But Henry was brave, and his resolution was formed in an instant. Hastily extinguishing the lamp, he retired to a corner of the counting-room, and awaited the approach of the midnight visitor. A stealthy step approached the office, seemingly a familiar one, for it avoided the boxes and bales, and advanced directly to the glazed door; the intruder entered, and Henry held his breath, and listened to his movements. A moment after, he heard the click of the steel and flint of a tinder-box; and the next, the light of an ignited match discovered to him the countenance of Richard Martin. Wondering what could have called him to the store, at that late hour, and how he had effected an entrance, he awaited his further movements. And his worst suspicions were realized; for the young man unlocked the desk, and, looking fearfully around, laid his hand upon a roll of bills which lay within it. But as the gaze of the young robber wandered over the room, it met the steady glance of his fellow-clerk, and uttering a wild cry, he dropped his prize. Henry advanced towards him. “Richard!” he said; and his voice was choked and sorrowful. “Richard!” The guilty boy fell upon his knees, and hid his face in his hands. “Oh, Harry! do not expose me! I—I— Oh, save me, Harry!” Henry was silent; but his breast heaved, and his face was pale. At length he said, “Richard, how could you do this? How could you—” The word would not come to the orphan's lips, for the child of his mother's friend was before him. The ready lie came to the aid of Richard. “O, Harry! I never would have thought of this, but I owed Fred. Johnson; and I had no money to pay him. I intended to replace it next week. Oh, Harry, I did not mean to steal it; do you think I did?” “I hope not, Richard; but how did you procure a key? How did you enter?” “It was the key of the upper loft door; it fits this.” Richard trembled while he uttered the lie, for he had taken a wax impression of the lock. But Henry noticed it not. “And you will not inform Mr. Abbot, Henry! It would ruin me. I should be cast forth, on the world, without a character. Oh, Harry!” and the artful youth smiled inwardly, for he saw the tears in the eyes of his credulous friend. “Will you promise me never to attempt the like again, Richard!” “Yes! yes! I swear it.” “Only promise, Richard! and keep your promise. Now how much do you owe your friend?” “Five dollars” Henry took out his pocket book. “Here is the sum,” said he; “and when you want money, come to me, and I will share with you what I have. But O, I implore you, Richard, never contemplate the crime you have this night escaped. And leave these companions! They will lead you into new difficulties, that perhaps I cannot relieve.” “I will, Henry!” said Richard; “you have saved me, and I will follow your advice!” “Well, Richard, heaven grant you may! And now good night!” continued he, as he prepared to leave the store. “I will keep your secret for your dead mother's sake!” They parted, and Henry proceeded to his home. “D—n him!” muttered Richard between his teeth; and he half turned back to the store. “But I won't, though! His five dollars will pay for the next spree! Cursed fool!—ha, ha!”</field>

Henry arose the next morning with that strange, unaccountable feeling we have all, at times, experienced, but none can comprehend; that indefinable presentiment of coming misfortune which may, for aught we know, be one part of our invisible communication with the world of spirits. He pursued his labors, however, with his usual zeal, tho' he could not cast from his soul the heaviness which oppressed it. It was evening. The other clerks, with Richard, had departed, and Henry was preparing to close the store, when Mr. Abbot appeared. It was contrary to his usual habit to return after his late dinner, and Henry knew not what should have brought him forth; but the vague feeling of coming ill rose again to his mind. But his heart was right; why should he fear? “Henry, I should like to speak a few words with you,” said Mr. Abbot. Henry unlocked the door, and re-entered the store with his employer. Mr. Abbot seated himself, and motioned Henry to a chair. He obeyed, and then, wonderingly awaited what his master should say. “My boy,” said the merchant, “I have heard some accusations against you. I am loth to believe them. Several sums have been missed, at different times, by Mr. Woodley, and he has been unable to account for them. But mark me, Henry! I do not suspect you, my boy! But I would be relieved of any doubt in the matter. You keep the cash account?” “Yes, sir.” “Will you permit me to inspect it?” “Certainly, sir,” as he unlocked the draw, and took out the book. “It's here.” The merchant took it, and glanced over the columns. He appeared satisfied, as Henry's glance rested on his face. Suddenly he paused, and looked at the boy with a scrutinizing gaze— “Will you look here?” Henry glanced at the page—he changed color, and was silent. “Are not these figures altered?” “Yes, sir.” “By your hand?” Henry was again silent. “I am sorry—I am, my boy! But I cannot believe you guilty—” “Oh, do not believe it. I am innocent— indeed I am. I know not who has changed the figures, I—” “Yet it was Richard who first informed Mr. Woodley that there were several small sums missing which had not been entered on the cash account.” “Richard!” cried Henry. “I was loath to believe his suspicions of your dishonesty. I did not credit them. Yet I knew not but that you had thoughtlessly done this. Tell me, my boy! have you been urged to this by difficulties. Confess to me. If it is so, and you will reveal it all to me, I promise to forgive you. Nay, more; I will see that in future you shall not be—” The merchant paused, for the orphau had risen from his seat, and stood proudly confronting him. “Sir, I am INNOCENT! I know not who would ruin me.” “How, then, are the alternations of your figures to be accounted for?” Henry spoke not. A sad, a dark suspicion shot across his mind. Richard had spoken to Mr. Abbot. Richard, whom he had detected, and—forgiven—Richard, whom he had befriended And he was thus repaid. A dark thought of revenge crossed his mind. But again came the thought of his mother's friend—of his own loved benefactress. He was silent still. Mr. Abbot gazed at him sorrowfully. “Is it come to this?” he asked. “Do you fear to trust me? Have I not been your friend?” “Oh, my benefactor! my more than fa ther!” cried the orphan, falling on his knees. “I would not wrong you. I have nothing to confess; I am innocent, in truth I am!” “And whom do you suspect?” “Richard Martin,” rose to the lips of Henry, but he uttered not the name aloud. “This is trifling, Henry,” said the merchant. “I would save you, I would befriend you. But you must first confess your folly— I will not call it crime. To-morrow I shall expect your decision.” And buttoning his great coat, for the night was cold and stormy, Mr. Abbot rose to leave. Henry mechanically locked the door, and put the keys in his pocket. “I will take the keys to-night,” said the merchant. Henry felt as if a dagger had pierced his heart. His breast heaved convulsively—he spoke not, but stretched forth his hand. Mr. Abbot walked quickly away, and the orphan sunk upon the stone step of the door. The cold, biting sleet blew keenly in his unprotected face. The wind whistled around the corner of Central street, and swept the chill drifts towards him. But he heeded them not!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER IX. THE ATTACK AND THE RESCUE. “Now, Balthazar, when be comes, spring at him.” “Ay, I'll warrant thee, I'll make short work!” The Patrician's Son. Henry entered the house of Mr. Abbot — now no more a home to him — and proceeded to the parlor which he had always entered with a light and buoyant step. The family were seated round the centre-table, and Mrs. Abbot, with her usual kindly greeting, made a place for Henry. Lucia drew to his side, and whispered, “O, I've been wishing you'd come. This beautiful annual father has given me, and I do wish you would read from it. Mother would so like to hear it.” Henry glancd at Mr. Abbot. He was intently poring over a newspaper; but there was a cloud upon his usually placid brow, and the orphan knew too well the cause. Lucia remarked the saddened expression of his countenance. She looked up in his face with a sweet smile, and said, “Henry, what is the matter with you?” Henry answered not, but he could not check the sigh—it would come! “Are you not well, Henry?” asked Mrs. Abbot. “Yes—that is—yes, I am well—perfectly.” “Will you not read this beautiful story, Henry?” said Lucia; “that is, if you would like—” “Lucia, it is time to retire; and Henry, there is much for you to do to-morrow,” said Mr. Abbot, with a significant glance. Henry arose, and left the room. When the orphan reached his chamber, he could scarcely support himself. But kneeling down by the bedside, he prayed—prayed to the Giver of all good, to the Father of mercy, for strength to bear his trials. He arose with a feeling of trust and confidence. “But I cannot stay,” he said to himself, “I cannot brook distrust.” Hastily seizing a pen, with trembling hand he wrote the following letter to Mr. Abbot. My dear Master —for you are still dear to me: I am unjustly suspected, and the time will come when it shall appear so. I can no longer serve you, or be an inmate of your family. Circumstances are against me, but I cannot explain them. I cannot remain. I throw myself again upon the world. May heaven bless you and your family. Henry. His few arrangements were soon made, and in an hour he had quietly left the house. A small bundle of clothes were his whole incumbrance, with a few dollars, that he had saved from his salary, in his pocket. It was a dreadful night. One of those, when the wind that sweeps along the streets is like a scythe; when the vanes creak on their icy pivots, and the sleet is piled up on the deserted door-stones; a night for deeds of crime: a night to make the poor groan: a night in which the houseless—die! Henry walked along Common street, until he reached Market. Then he stopped, and pondered. “Alone!” murmured he; “a wanderer, and an outcast. Oh, my mother, my mother!” The clock of Park Street Church tolled out the midnight hour. He thought of the last night—of Richard “Have I deserved this of you—alas!—But I will forgive him for his mother's sake!” Suddenly he recollected that he had not left the letter which he had written to Mr. Abbot It was in his pocket. “I cannot return to the house,” thought he; and he turned down Court street, and took his way to the store was watchman, as the young man passed him, recognised and addressed him: “A raw night this.” “Yes, sir,” and Henry turned the corner of Kilby street. How the signs creaked! How the wind swept up from the water. He reached the door—the stone— where a few hours since he had given his master his keys and his trust. He stooped, and slid the letter beneath the door. A keen blast swept at the same time along the street, and chilled his heart. With hurried step, Henry left the store, and retraced his course. He had entered Flag Alley, searcely minding whither he went, when a distant cry aroused him—a short, quick cry, as of one in a struggle. He grasped his cane firmly in one hand and his bundle in the other, and sped swiftly in the direction of the sound. He dashed through into Dock Square, and the cry was heard again. It was for help. He rushed on till he found himself in the dreary and vicious part of the North End, known then and since as Hatter's Square. A moment's glance, as he entered the dim avenue, revealed the object of his pursuit. Two ruffians had attacked a stranger in the streets, and while he defended himself, it was his sharp cry for succor that had roused the orphan. His aid indeed was opportune The stranger had sunk to the ground, and the knee of one of the villains was upon his breast. Henry was slight, but his sinews were strong, and his heart brave. He paused not, but rushed upon them, and a well-directed blow struck the foremost senseless to the ground. The other took counsel of his fears, and made good his escape, at the same instant that a watchman's rattle was heard, in the distance, and a posse advanced to the spot. Henry knelt beside the stranger, and took his hand. A dagger was in his breast, but it had not struck the heart. The sudden blow of Henry had foiled the murderer's purpose. 2 “Hillo, hillo—o—o! here! what's the row?” cried a burly watchman in a great box-coat, with hook and rattle in his hand; “A man killed—what's the matter?' “Matter—no matter. Come and help this man here, and take that ruffian into custody,” said Fowler, as he bent over the fallen stranger. “Why, I'm blest if the man an't bleody. Here's murder—here's assassination in the streets of Boston!” The eager lookers-on crowded round to satisfy themselves that the man was really— no mistake—bloody; and the individual who had a moment or two before been prostrated by Henry's blow, seeing their attention engaged, quietly gathered himself up from the ground, and took a station among the throng. A tall, slim individual, in a green frock coat, elbowed his way through the crowd, who awe-stricken fell back. “I am a gentleman of the press,” said he; “what are the facts? who are the individuals?” Half a dozen windows new flew open; half a dozen night-caps appeared in them, and half a dozen cracked trebles shrieked, “what's the matter?” In a few minutes the wounded man recovered sufficiently from his swoon, to thank his preserver. His short tale was soon told, the crowd gazing with open mouths upon him. “I am captain of the ship Mexique,” said he, in a foreign accent, “I was attacked by these ruffians, whom you have delivered me from; I defended myself as long as I was able, when an unlucky blow in the temple stretched me; I can recollect nothing, then, but a sharp pain in my side, at the same instant that the ruffian over me reeled, and— I suppose I must have fainted.” “Where's the man you struck, sir?” asked one of the watchmen of Fowler. `Where is he?' and `where is he?' went round the ring. `He lay there,' and `I saw him,' cried several at once. But he had disappeared. Henry felt a slight pull at the string of a locket which hung around his neck, and which contained a lock of his sister's hair; he turned, but he saw only the bluff face of a watchman. He felt in his bosom; the locket was gone, the string cut. “He must be an old un',” said the watch, as Henry made known his loss; “right in the teeth of the ufficers.” But it was useless to attempt to find him, in the crowd that had now collected. “But shall I not accompany you, sir,” said Henry, turning to the wounded captain. “Thanks, brave sir,” and leaning on his arm he walked with Fowler from the wondering crowd, and proceeded to the ship of which he was commander. She was a Callao bark, and lay in the stream. “Mexique, a-h-o-y; send your boat ashore.” The ship's boat soon struck the wharf, and the captain took his seat within it. Henry was turning to depart, when the captain said, “Will you not come aboard, my brave young man?” Henry was about to refuse, but the captain again spoke: “Come, come, amigo. We must not part thus. I sail in the early morning—come on board.” Fowler thus urged, seated himself beside the captain, and a dozen brawny arms soon laid the quiverin boat alongside the ship. After the captain's wound had been attended to, he had some refreshment spread before them, and urged Henry to partake. “Pardon my freedom,” said the captain, as he filled their glasses for the second time from a bottle of old Port, and after the conversation began to be lively, “pardon my freedom, but may I ask what occupation you follow?” “At present, none,” answered Henry. “Ah, excuse me—a gentleman, as I might have seen.” “No, you mistake me,” said the self-exiled clerk. But this led to inquiries which resulted in the orphan's relation of his whole history. The simple story of Henry Fowler made a great impression upon Captain Mina. It bore the stamp of truth, for the agitation of the poor orphan could not have been feigned. Yet it seemed strange indeed that a youth scarcely of age should have renounced his friends and his home, and fled with the brand of suspicion upon him, rather than expose his enemy. Many would have doubted Henry's truth; but Captain Mina, a man of high feeling, saw the mainspring of the orphan's action—a deep and lasting gratitude for the kindness of his mother's friend, that would never permit him to injure her child. Fowler reasoned wrong: exposure of Richard's character would not then have ruined him entirely, and it might have saved him from a darker fate. But Henry was no philosopher. “Come with me, my brave boy,” said Captain Mina, after Henry had finished his recital; “come with me, and I will make your fortune. My ship sails to-morrow. Go with me to Lima. I have interest there.” Henry grasped the hand of the Captain, and thanked him for his generous offer. It was no time to hesitate. “And yet,” said Captain Mina, “would you return to your employer, I will go with you. Think well. Much as I should be gratified in your sailing with me, you shall do nothing against your inclination. “Oh, sir! I cannot return. No! even were my innocence proved, yet he has suspected me. I cannot return.” “Well, then, you shall not. Come with me. Here,” continued he, opening a closet in the cabin, “are books. You will find some English ones among them; you—” “But am I not to do any thing?” asked Henry. “Do! I think we shall find employment enough when we get out. There, I shall want you to keep log, read to me, and other things. You will find enough to do. And another thing; did you ever study Spanish?” Henry had, in his leisure hours, made some progress in the language, and the information pleased his friend exceedingly. “Well, well; you will master it easily. O, yes, amigo, we shall find enough to do.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">My dear Master —for you are still dear to me: I am unjustly suspected, and the time will come when it shall appear so.

May heaven bless you and your family. Henry.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER X. THE ROBBERY. Dorhety. “Finish this job, and we shall be rich.” Martin. “Come on, then.” —The Highwayman. “Who the devil was the covey?” said the ruffian who had fled when his comrade was felled by Henry's blow, as they met again, in a dark alley at the water's edge, where now stands Quincy Market. “Who was it? If you hadn't run away, like a coward, you'd seen who it was. It was Harry Fowler.” “What could I do? half a dozen watchmen singing out. But how came Fowler out?” “Hang me if I know. But I've tripped up his heels at the store for him. But, look you, Fred. If you ever catch me in such a scrape again, blow me for a greeny.” “But you proposed it, Dick.” “Well, but how the blazes was I to know the d—d fool would fight so?” Why, I had to stick him in self-defence.” “Heavens!” cried his companion, turning pale, and seizing Martin's arm, “you didn't murder him?” “No, only let a little blood, and curse me if I didn't lose my dirk, too. That Fowler's arm is a young sledge.” “But the man? did — did he recover.” “Yes! don't stand there shaking. There is no damage done. Only gi' me your hand to thrash Fowler. His jig'll be up at the store, soon.” “But won't it be better to make him one of us. D—n it, we can get him jugged.” “Yes, and then have him peach. No, the sneaking devil would as soon cut his own throat as touch a cent of his master's money. I've got a better train than that laid; ha, ha!” “But how are we to make a raise? I'm cleaned out, and owe Charley Minot a V.” “Pay him?” “When I pay my board-bill; ha, ha, ha!” “But an't you going to try to get back to old Billy's again?” “No, by Jove! S'pose I'm going to be store-sweep another year? No! can't we make a raise? Look here, Dick, store open? eh, my boy?” Richard held up a key. “But what's the use? nothing to be had; bank deposit.” “None drawn this afternoon?” “Yes, by hokey! I forgot. Fifteen hundred dollars were put in the safe since bank-hours.” Fred's eyes twinkled. “Can't we have the handling?” “No, d—n it—our coach is blocked there —it's in the safe. But you got those skeleton keys?” “Had'em this fortnight.” “Then it's done. Will you swear to stick by me?” “Yes!” “Then we'll appropriate, and then we'll off to New York. There'll be no staying here; Fowler'll be suspected, and, d—n him, he'll blow me!” “Well, come on!” “Give us your fist!” And the two emerged from the alley, and stole along the water's side till they reached Kilby street. They crept round to the back entrance, and reconnoitred. All was silent; the snow that had fallen in the evening blocked up the door, and Richard called out, “Fred, lend us a hand to clear this.” The drift was soon removed, and Martin unlocked the door. “You hang on and keep watch; I'll go in. Let's have the keys.” Fred Johnson produced a bunch of delicate keys, known as skeleton, and then, leaving the door ajar, Richard entered the store. Striking a light, he looked with a searching gaze around the room. The rays fell upon something beneath the door. Richard took it up; it was Henry Fowler's letter. The countenance of the false friend turned pale as death, as he read the few lines. His heart smote him for his injustice to the generous Fowler; and the thought of all his fellow orphan had done for him came at once to his mind. He beheld him, in his mind's vision, sustaining his own dying mother; and he thought of the return he had made. Richard was conscience-stricken. Had a word from Henry's lips then come to his ear, the springs of his hard heart had gushed. He almost turned to leave the store, when the voice of Fred. Johnson recalled him to his former self. “Be quick, Dick; it's most morning. Richard opened the counting-room door, and unlocked the safe. The money was before him, and all thought of the wronged Henry was banished. “Ha, ha!” laughed he; “it's all the better. There'll be no need of our sloping to-morrow. Fowler'll have to bear the blame. He's run away, and I've got his letter. Ho, ho!” “What the devil are you laughing at?” cried Fred. Johnson, through the door. “Who would'nt laugh—here's the article,” said Martin. “Hurra! here's tin enough for a spree,” cried he, exhibiting a roll of bills.” “Come, then! let's be off, and prepare for our journey.” “D—n it, Fred., you may go, but I'll stay. I'll warrant you I'll get out of the scrape. Come down to my room, and we'll divide. You can streak if you wish, and I'll make all right here. Come, softly!” The promising couple closed the door, and took their way, skulking along, till they reached Richard's lodgings in Milk street. Great was the wonder of the Abbot family the next morning when Henry's seat at the breakfast-table was vacant. The servants knocked repeatedly at his chamber-door, but there was no answer; and when the room was entered, the bed was found unpressed. Mr. Abbot knew not what to think. He was fearful that some accident had befallen the orphan; and he regretted his severity, for in his heart he still thought him innocent. With burried steps, the merchant walked to his store. It was still unopened, and Mr. Woodley, his partner, was at the door. They entered together, and the merchant anxiously inquired for Henry. “I have not seen him since yesterday,” was the reply. “And Richard?” “I have just despatched him to your house for the keys.” Mr. Abbot knew not what to say. He seated himself, and took up the morning paper. Suddenly a cry escaped his partner. The merchant looked up, and beheld Mr. Woodley standing pale and motionless before the safe. “The store has been entered. Fifteen hundred dollars have been abstracted from the safe.” The paper fell from the merchant's hand. At this moment Richard entered. The quick eye of the clerk comprehended at a glance the state of affairs. But his face appeared unconscious, he trembled not, but advanced towards Mr. Woodley. “Richard, have you seen Henry?” “Not since he left the store at half past nine o'clock last night, sir.” “What time!” “Half past nine, sir.” “Were you with him?” “No, sir, He was locking the door, when I happened to come along, and told me he was going home.” “You are sure of this, Richard?” “Yes, sir.” “Mr. Woodley, we must look into this. Prepare some advertisements for the newspapers, and describe this boy's appearance.” Mr. Woodley fixed his eye on Richard, for the young clerk was no favorito with him, while, on the contrary, Henry's quiet virtues had made him universally beloved. But there appeared in Martin's countenance nothing but blank amazement. “Richard, you need not spread this business.” “May I ask, sir, what it is?” “The safe has been entered, and money taken.” “But you do not suspect Henry, sir,” cried Richard, turning an appealing look to Mr. Abbot. “I cannot do otherwise.” “I do not believe—” “But yet you informed me of his previous peculations.” “But---but---sir, Henry would not.” “My boy, I am afraid he is guilty. But at present we will look further into this matter. Mr. Woodley, you had better lodge information of this at the police office, and take such other steps as you may deem advisable.” Lucia felt unhappy all the morning. She knew not why, but Henry's absence brought a cloud over every object. And yet she said, “He will return; he will be home to dinner.” But dinner came, and her father, but no Henry. And there was a frown on Mr. Abbot's brow, and he met not her anxious look with his usual smile. She went up to him, and asked, “Where is Henry?” “I know not—he is a scoundrel!” Lucia let fall her father's hand, and uttered a cry, while the good Mrs. Abbot dropped the work which she was embroidering, and raising her spectacles, looked with an inquiring gaze at her husband. “You are not speaking of Henry?” she said. “But I am. He has absconded with fifteen hundred dollars.” Mrs. Abbot gazed at her husband with an incredulous expression, and shook her head. Lucia burst into tears. “Father, it isn't so; you do not mean it; say, father.” “Nay, child, it is true. He has been in the habit of abstracting sums from the desk; I discovered it, and spoke with him last evening. Fearing punishment if he remained, perhaps, he has disappeared, having entered the store, last night, with false keys, and stolen all that was in the safe.” “This is a sad affair,” said Mrs. Abbot; “he appeared so good, so—” “It isn't true, mother; father has been deceived; Henry could not do it!” “My child! But how did you discover that he had been dishonest?” asked Mrs Abbot. “It was his junior, Richard Martin, who intimate it to me.” “And have you no reason to doubt him?” “Yes, yes,” interrupted Lucia, “it's that Richard; he hates Henry, I know. Oh, father! Henry is not guilty; I know he is not!” “Lucia, you had better retire,” said her father; “Henry is guilty.” Lucia, with weeping eyes, went to her chamber. “I was loth to think this of Henry,” said the merchant to his wife. “I thought that Richard might have been mistaken. I knew not that he might not have some object. But this last night's business has forced me to believe him guilty. He was seen last night to enter the store.” “By whom?” “Richard, and—” Mrs. Abbot looked distrustful; “Richard again?” “The watchman, too, met Henry at midnight, in the midst of the storm. He had a packet in his hand, and appeared in great agitation. All is against him.” “And yet I doubt his guilt!” said Mrs. Abbot. Lucia was in her chamber, weeping bitterly for her lost friend. Yet she said not, `I doubt his guilt,' but “I know he is innocent.” Henry was out on the broad sea, ten hours' sail from Boston. Had he known the gentle Lucia's thoughts, his heart had not been sad!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XI. FANNY. A sister whom he loved, but saw her not Before his weary pilgrimage began. If friends he had, he bade adieu to none. Farewell a word that must be, and hath been, A sound that makes us linger,yet farewell Childe Harold. What a happy creature was Fanny Fowler! happy in her own blithe heart and her own sweet temper. But she was not now the little laughing Fanny of other days; but the levely and innocent maiden of sweet sixteen. And she was a favorite with all, and, most of all, with Mrs. Merton, the kind lady who had adopted her. All loved the sweet girl, and joyed to hear her merry voice at home, or her light laugh in the green woods. And Fanny was grateful, too, to her kind friends. Bright and joyous would she return from her early rambles, when summer sprinkled the fields with snow-drops, and garlanded the woods with jessamine, to lay on Mrs. Merton's table the freshest bunch of flowers. But most of all she loved to prepare a flower-gift for her Henry, and many a green wreath and sweet boquet were woven to send to Bosten for her dear brother. But when from him came a letter, then was the maiden's gladnass. It was read again and again, and thea deposited among her choicest treasures. It was a cold, raw afternoon. Fanny had just returned from school, and sat with Mrs. Merton, by the bright fire, reading a story of the pilgrims' trials and triumphs. It was her usual occupation the long winter afternoons. A knock came to the door. “A letter for Miss Fanny,” said Cæsar, as his shining face appeared at the parlor-door. “O, from Henry,” cried she, dropping her book, and starting up. The good black's countenance reflected the joy that sparkled in the eyes of his young mistress. He handed her the letter, and then lingered to ask about “Massa Henry's” health. Fanny broke the seal. Alas for the joy of the sister's heart! It was her brother's farewell and blessing. He was going to South America. The letter fell from the sister's hand, and she burst into passionate tears. Mrs. Merton drew the poor girl to her bosom, and Fanny tried again to read:— “ * * * * Fanny, I have been wronged; suspected of a crime; and I cannot explain. I shall go a distant land. When I return, I trust, my immocence will be established. O, my dear sister, may heaven guard you! Remember your poor brother, and pray for him. Good-bye, my dear, dear Fanny —” She could read no farther, but, throwing her arms around the neck of Mrs. Merton, she sobbed long and bitterly. Had he then left her — his sister — and gone to a foreiga land? she could not bolieve it. “He would not leave his Fanny!” she murmured. But he was suspected — of a crime! What was it? Her kind friend's tears mingled with the orphan's, as she perused poor Henry's letter. It was the outpouring of a brother's love; and there was so much sorrow, too, and yet so high, so noble a tone of resolution in it, that she could not but believe the writer's was a virtuous soul. “Dear Fanny,” she said, “do not weep Of whatever he is accused, I believe he is innocent. Dry your tears, my dear child, and pray with me that he may be proved so.” The orphan knelt by the side of her kind hearted friend, and prayed for her her far-off brother. But the next day a letter came from Mr. Abbot, and the cold, hard statement of the merchant almost carried conviction to the mind of Mrs. Merton. A postscript was in Mrs. Abbot's hand, and it relieved the heart of her sister, for it spoke her belief in Henry's innocence, and her fear that Mr. Abbot was deceived. A kind note came, too, from Lucia; a note for Henry's sister. Fanny wept and smiled over it; for it breathed the writer's confidence in the suspected one, and her love and sympathy for his sister. “May heaven bless her kind heart,” said she; “for she believes my brother guiltless.” “You had better write to your cousin Lucia,” said Mrs. Merton. Fanny looked up in her face; “Cousin?” she said. “And are you not my adopted daughter, my dear child?” said the lady, kissing the orphan's forehead. Fanny's tears gushed forth again, but they were not sorrowful tears. “Cousin!” she repeated; “cousin Lucia!” How much often lies hid in a single word! How much the future may develope! Time is the Grave-digger—and—the Resurrectionist!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XII. CONCERT HALL. Where the gas lights burn so brightly, Where the music sounds so sprightly, Wilt thou meet me there, love? Where the hacks and cabs are posting To the fancy halls in Bosting, Wilt thou meet me there, love? —Song. “Where's Fred. Johnson gone, Dick?” “New York.” “Have you heard from Fowler?” “No, he's got clear; Woodley's mad as h—l.” G-d, I thought he would be on to me.” “You, Dick?” “Yes, you see I was intimate with the cursed scamp.” “Well, you going to Forster's, to-night?” “I don't know; what's the spree?” “Oh, a ball. Go; Frank Block is going.” “Who do you take, Ned?” “Kate.” “Hang on to her still, eh?” “Yes, d—n it, can't get rid of her. But you'll go, won't you?” “Yes, I guess so.” “Be ou hand, then; I'll meet you at the Exchange, at 7 o'clock.” “Exchange, 7 o'clock, yes.” This conversation took place between our worthy friend Dick, and a worthy associate, and clerk, Ned Rifton. Ned was a wild fellow, but an honorable one; and so Dick “kept dark,” as he expressed it, in his company. “Forster's,” as Concert Hall was designated, was then, as now, used as an assembly room, for the elite of the town; and the ball of to-night was the best of the season. Richard, since his successful villany, had not mingled much with his former associates, but had confined himself exclusively to business, hoping to elude thus the suspicions of Mr. Woodley, whom he knew suspected that there had been some foul play. Mr. Abbot had repeatedly questioned Richard upon what he knew of his fellow-clerk's habits, and, with a cunning beyond his years he had invariably labored to give as favorable a east to the orphan's character as he could. He spoke so often of Henry's generosity, and told how he had assisted him in his boyish troubles, that he grew daily more and more in the good graces of his master; and even Lucia, who had boldly avowed her suspicions of Richard, in the outset, began insensibly to believe that she had wronged him, and that he was indeed, as he protessed, a friend to the lost Henry. Concert Hall was in its glory. To be sure there was no “big lantern” then, and the deacons, and cobblers, and stone fences, and fries, and stews, were not then, as now, the lares of the establishment. But Forster kept a good table, prime bar, and got out fine “sprees” for the F. Y. M. of the town. Tonight the windows were brilliantly illuminated, and the merry jigs and contra dances kept time to the inspiring music. There was the mingling of the pure and the polluted: the enervated roue, and the young girl trusted by her proud mamma to “a friend's” protection. Richard Martin and Ned Rifton were there, with their associate Frank Block. Rifton was accompanied by a girl of seventeen, a lovely creature, yet with the stamp of violent passions on her brow, and a reckless expression in her dark eye. She was virtuous, and Ned Rifton knew it, and he loved her. Yet his long intercourse with her had been interpreted by his loose companions as one not favorable to Kate's character. Ned had not the courage to deny their suspicions and hence his slighting mention of her name to Martin. Yet he loved her, and was beloved. “How can you endure that Martin?” asked Kate Willis of her partner. “Oh, he's a jovial, social fellow, Kate,” answered Ned. “You don't know him; you must be acquainted with him. Here, Dick; allow me to present to you my dear friend, Miss Willis, Mr. Martin,” said the young buck, with a wink at the person addressed, which was not annoticed by the quick eyes of the fair one. Richard made his best “Schaffer-bow,” as the salute of a celebrated professor of antics in those days was called; and the lady greeted him with a most captivating smile. He requested her hand for the next cotillion. She did not refuse, though she had wondered `how Ned could endure that Martin'! What had changed Kate so suddenly? The wink of Ned had nettled her, for she knew too well what it meant, and she resolved to play off Dick against her lover. Ned Rifton felt unhappy. He knew not why, but he did not like to see Dick intimate with Kate so suddenly. Three times he had asked her hand for a dance; she was engaged; she danced with Mr. Martin. “The devil take Martin,” thought Ned; “but I'm glad of it. I shall get rid of the girl.” Ned thought so, but he felt it not. Such is the friendship and confidence of the “jovial souls!” The merry sets whirled round in the mazy dance. The brilliant lights shed their glare on the smiling faces, and the gorgeous dresses. Dick talked, and laughed, and rattled away, the gayest of the gay. Kate had enchanted him. Where was Henry Fowler! There was a pause in the dancing, and Richard Martin and Kate Willis promenaded the hall. Suddenly a hand was laid upon the arm of the clerk. He turned and beheld —Fred. Johnson. “You here,” cried he, turning pale. “Yes; can't you disengage yourself, Dick?” Martin spoke a few words to Kate, and led her to a seat. Ned Rifton was by her side in a moment. “You were agreeably entertained by the `unendurable' Martin?” said Ned. Kate looked up with a provoking smile. “Yes, he is another instance of how one may be deceived by first impressions.” “And pray may I ask who was the first?” Kate sighed; she saw he was vexed. “I can interpret that sigh—” “And what may be your interpretation, sir?” “That you are tired of me, Miss Willis.” “Ha, ha! you are a wizard,” laughed Kate. Ned Rifton sprang to his feet. “Don't let us have a scene here,” said the malicious girl. “H—l and—” “Ah, Ned, how are you,” said Frank Block, advancing. “Miss Willis, may I request your hand for the next dance?” “Certainly.” And she gave her hand to Frank, with a triumphant smile, as she noticed Ned's amazement. Rifton looked after her a moment. “The devil! does she mean to—” He walked across the hall, and requested the homeliest girl he could find to favor him with her hand; and led her to the set in which were Kate and her partner. And there they danced. Both felt vexed and unhappy; every word they spoke seemed to choke. Yet they exchanged scornful glances. This was jealousy; and what young lovers call—a proper spirit! Ho, ho! “What in the old-boy's name are you back here for?” asked Dick, as he rejoined Fred. Johnson; “supposing you're suspected?” “I'm in a serape and you must get me out; what say you?” “What's the row?” “I've been passing bogus.” “The devil you have! Where's your share of our lift?” “Gone by the board long ago, and, d—a it, I wish I had gone too—” “Come in here,” said Martin, leading him to a private room; “let's hear the yarn. Here, waiter, a couple of punches.” “Why, you see it's just here,” said Fred. as he drained his liquor and replaced the glass, “I got to New York flush; staid there a fortnight, and found myself with a hundred and fifty out of six hundred—the d—d faro-table swallowed it up. I then went up the river, to see an old aunt of mine, and—” Fred. stopped. He seemed undecided whether to go on or not. “Well, what then?” asked Dick. “I was received by the old lady like a son; and by her daughter Mary—” A smile stole over Richard Martin's features. “But what's the use in dwelling on it,” continued Fred. “I fell in love with Mary—” “And seduccd her, eh, Fred.?” “Yes! black-hearted scoundrel that I was —I did—” “Ha, ha! Fred. Johnson, going to preach?” “Preach? no, but practise; will you listen to me?” “Go on.” “We eloped together—hired lodgings in New York, and—I lived happy for a short time. Well, the money was soon spent. How long have I been gone?” “Three months.” “Well, six weeks from the time I left Boston, I found myself with twenty dollars in my pocket, expensive lodgings, and a helpless girl depending on me. Dick, I risked that—that last—and—lost it!” Fred. paused, and covered his face with his hands. “More fool you,” thought Richard Martin, but he said nothing. “Well, I lost it, and left the table. As I went out of the door, the man who won it followed me; `Sir,' said he, `I'll lend you what you've lost, if you want to try your luck again.' I grasped at his offer; played, and won—won, won, won!” “D—d lucky dog,” thought Dick, but he still said nothing. “After the hell was closed, I refunded the money which the stranger had lent me. He requested me to aceompany him home; when we arrived—” “This is a cursed long yarn,” thought Dick, but he did not think aloud. “`Young man,' said he `do you know what you've been doing to-night?' I looked at him. `You've been playing with counterfeit stakes. Look at the bills I let you have.' I looked; they appeared to me as good. `And yet,' continued he, `this is all bogus.' `Explain yourself, sir,' says I. `Why, it is simply this. I saw you were in a strait. I thought your fortune might turn, and I offered you this loan. If you had lost, it would have been only the expense of the paper to me; if you gained, you'd pay me in current money.' `But supposing I had been discovered, and the money proved false?' `That would have been your business.' `But if I had revealed your loan?' `What good would it have done you? I could and should have proved that you had lost your money to me in the evening. I should have maintained that I lent you what I won of you; could you have disproved it?' I was thunderstruck. `You are uncommonly candid, sir,' said I. `Why should'nt I be; no one overhears our conversation. But hark ye, young man. I have an object. If you will join me, you shall be rich. You see how easy it is to escape detection. We will work together. If one is accused at the gaming table, the other shall support him in implicating some one else.”' “And you closed with him, eh, Fred.?” said Dick, with a cunning wink. “What could I do? I knew not what the man might do. His coolness surprised me, and, to speak the truth, I felt afraid of him. Then I thought of Mary; she had been accustomed to every luxury; d—n it, I couldn't have her suffer, and I knew not but she might.” “Why didn't you leave her?” “Look here, Dick! I love that girl; she is the—By heaven, I would not leave her for my life!” “And yet you seduced her,” said Richard, sneeringly. “Yes, and by heaven, I will marry her Dick Martin, you don't know her She has changed me.” “Well, no matter about that. Go on with your story.” “I fell into the snare. I started the false money, and won. And Stimson, the villain, encouraged me. But it could not last long. I lost; I was discovered, and Stimson, the traitor, deserted me.” “And you was lagged?” “No, thank God. I escaped. I gave up to the master of the hell five hundred dollars. I had won. I am here, without a cent Mary is here, too.” “What do you intend to do?” “I want two hundred dollars, and will leave town.” “And where do you expect to raise it, Fred.?” “Of you, Dick?” “Of me?” “Yes, yes! I must have it of you. I know you've got it, and—why do you look so, man?” “Fred., you had your share.” “Dick, I know you're a d—d rascal. But I must have that money. I know your secret, and by H—I, old Abbot shall know it too, if you refuse me.” “Softly, Fred.; who talked of refusing you?” said Dick, startled at the vehemence of his companion. “But, hang it, I—I— havn't got it now.” “None of that, Dick,” said Fred., threateningly. “It's a fact. I have put it in some ventures.” “It's a lie!” Dick turned pale, and clinched his hands; but his prudence did not forsake him. “I tell you it's true. I have invested it in half a dozen small ventures. I've got but fifty on hand.” “Dick, I believe you are gumming. But let us have the fifty. That'll only pay a few of my debts.” “Let 'em run.” “I've had an officer dogging me all day—” “D—n it, you shall have it!” They re-entered the hall. “Ha! Fred., returned?” exclaimed Frank Block, as he recognised them. “Here, Ned, Johnson's got back.” “Hillo, old boy! glad to see you.” Richard Martin rejoined Kate Willis. He danced, laughed, and chatted with her. Ned was in an agony. The brilliant ball closed, and not till then, did he rejoin Kate Willis. He attended her home in silence.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XIII. THE COUNTERFEITER. A bold, bad man, Who murders with a smile upon his lip, And laughs at vil any. —Brooks. Richard and Fred. left the hall together. “When can you let me have it, Dick?” “To-morrow night.” “Honor bright?” “Honor bright.” They parted. As Dick walked with hurried steps along, he noticed that he was followed by a stout man, dressed in a great white coat. Dick fixed his eyes on him, and kept his way, but he found that the stranger still dogged him. As he reached his lodgings in Milk street, the man advanced, and laying his hand upon the clerk's arm, “I should like to speak with you,” said he. “Walk in,” said Richard, surprised; “I have not the pleasure of knowing you, sir,” continued he, as the light fell on the stranger's face. “No. You will probably know me better some time, however,” said the stranger, carelessly, as he unbuttoned his coat, and threw himself back in a chair; “my name is Stimson” “Stimson?” echoed Martin. “Ay! you have heard some fine tales of me, probably. You were closeted with my young friend, Fred. Johnson.” “And how know you that?” “O, some have considered me ubiquitous,” said the stranger. “But no matter. I want to have a little talk with you. Will you tell me how you are connected with Johnson?” “And why should I inform a stranger—” “Let's be better acquainted; if you'll trust me, we shall. Did Johnson tell you of the gambling business?” “Bogus,” said Dick, placing his forefinger at the side of his nose. “Ah, I see you know; well, he said I backed out—left him, eh?” “Exactly.” “Well, it's true. But, I'll tell you why. I found he was—honest!” “Honest!—ha, ha!” “Yes, or about to be. Now, my dear young friend,” continued the stranger, with a bland smile, “I have a great horror of the animal called a `repentant rogee.' I'd rather have a fine, spirited fellow, who don't mind sticking sea-captains, on a pinch, or unlocking—safes— etc.—ha, ha, ha!” Dick started. “He knows all,” thought he. “I must work my card.” Stimson noticed his agitation. “Now will you trust me?” “Can I depend on you?” “Depend? why, my boy, can't I blow you this minute, if I wish it. But you are safe.” “And what—” “I know what you would ask. I'll be frank with you. Johnson told me all about your scrape, when he was half-drunk. Says I, this is a fellow of the right mettle, and I resolved to see you. I have a scheme in preparation, and want a fellow of your spunk. As for that fellow, Johnson, he's a cowardly curse. Now, tell me what he said, for I reckon he tried to milk you.” “D—n him,” said Dick; and he proceeded to detail Fred.'s conversation; for he felt himself in the power of the stranger, and resolved to trust him, though he plotted in his heart—revenge! “And you are going to pay him the hush-money, eh?” “What can I do?” “Do? I'll let you into the secret Pay him the fifty—pay him. He has in his possession a hundred or two of the bogus; but his d—d honest scruples, that he has picked up, will make him destroy them. He has not yet done so, I know. Well, pay him, and make him promise not to reveal your secret. Then, my boy, I'll jug him. I will send a letter to the police, informing them that a famous gambler and counterfeiter is in town. They'll arrest him, and the bogus will be found. D—n it, don't you see,” cried Stimson, rubbing his hands, and good-humoredly punching his comrade; “don't you see?” “I see it, yes!” said Dick. “But won't he peach? And how shall you escape?” “Ho, ho—I shall make myself scarce.— Now, will you come into my scheme?” “What is it?” “The particulars are in this paper,” said the stranger, taking a packet from his bosom. “Read them, and I will see you at this hour to-morrow night. Pay Johnson—two hours from the time he receives your fifty—he's jugged. All night, my boy!” For a few minutes after Stimson had left, Richard Martin remained in deep thought. Then, seizing the paper which the stranger had given him, he hurriedly perused its contents. It was the plan of a contemplated mutiny on board the ship Halcion, in which Stimson, and three others had engaged passages. Four others also, were in the plot, who had shipped as seamen in the same vessel. The paper went on to state that, after the mutiny, the vessel was to run for the Floridas, and then take on board twelve more who were sworn to the business. “A well-concerted plan, truly,” thought the young clerk. “But if the fool thinks I'll play second fiddle, he's mistaken, that's all. But hang it, can't I turn this to my advantage? This paper—But no; blast it, he'll blab my secret if I try to injure him. I'm in a h—l of a hobble; but I reckon I'll sleep on it.” So saying the `nice young man' adjourned to the land of Nod. After Fred. Johnson left Dick, he took his course for the North End, and crossing the Mill Creek, wound round the back street, till he reached Sun Court, where now stands the Mariner's Bethel, but which was then occupied by one of those old oak-panelled, family mansions, that have now nearly all been swept away before the avalanche of bricks and mortar. It was once the residence of one of the colonial dignitaries, when Boston was a colonial town, and the North End was in its glory. But it was now no longer illumined by the blaze of festal mirth, nor echoed the deserted chambers to the sound of merry music. Fred. entered the unfastened front door, and passed along the broad hall, till he reached the small winding staircase, which conducted him to the chamber of his Mary. She was a beautiful being. With a face almost infantile in its contour, and in the expression of trust and confidence that beamed from it; a complexion as fair as the lily, through which the rich blood mantled like the sunlight upon an alabaster bust. She was indeed beautiful. And for such as thou, Fred. Johnson, had this being of beauty fallen. She sprang to her feet, as Fred. gently unclosed the door, and threw herself in his arms. “My dear Frederick, you have been gone so long.” “But I am returned, my love,” said the young man tenderly, as he kissed her fair brow, “Soon, soon I hope we shall be always together.” Mary sighed. Alas! she felt that prescience which the sage nor the wizard can command. “Frederick, have you seen that rough man who came to visit you in New York?” “No, my love! have you heard aught of him?” asked Johnson, anxiously. “He has been here.” “Here!” echoed Fred., “then I am lost!” “What mean you, Frederick,” cried Mary, alarmed at the paleness which overspread her lover's countenance. “Lost— nay— what mean you?” “Nothing. But that man is my enemy.” “Ah, Frederick, will you not confide in me? There is some trouble in your heart.— Dear Frederick, speak!” “I dare not tell you, Mary, you would—” “Cling to you and comfort you, forever,” cried the girl. “O, if you are guilty, you are still my Frederick—my own dear—” “Husband, it shall be,” interrupted the youth vehemently. “O forgive me for my cruelty—my baseness. We will fly from the town to the happy home of my father. He will pardon his guilty son, and love that son's dear wife. Mary! I will reveal all to you— my guilt—my misery.” And while the head of the trusting girl rested on the bosom of her lover, he told the whole history of his life—left not one word unsaid. And then Mary looked up in his face with a quiet smile, and said, “I love you better—better than ever! “But you must not receive that Martin's money. We will fly from him. Here— here are the jewels which you gave me, here are some of my own—my watch; take them, Frederick, they will be sufficient for us. We will go to your home, and it shall be mine, shall it not, dear Frederick!” “Forever! And here,” cried the youth, sinking upon his knees, “here I swear, never again to swerve from the strict path of rectitude. May God give me strength to keep my resolution.” “Amen,” said Mary.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XIV. THE ARREST. Some villanous plot Is working to my ruin. Said he aught, Or smiled he while he planned mischance to me? Shipton. Wednesday afternoon. And the nine worshipful selectmen of the good town of Boston had met at their office in Faneuil Hall. A letter was brought in, and forthwith opened. Johnson, a celebrated gambler and forger, who has escaped from New York, is now in town. Counterfeit money which he intends to utter is now in his possession. The police had better be speedy. His house is 15 Sun-Court street, and he will probably be found there, at 10, P. M. When he is arrested, your informant will make further disclosures affecting the public weal, if his own safety shall be guarantied him. A Friend. This was a bone for the nine worthy selectmen to pick. It must be seen to. What impudence! A gambler and forger! Counterfeited money! “Send for the superintendent of police.” “But isn't it a hoax?” put in a wary member of the worthy nine “No,” was the majority's voice. “It is plain that some rascal reveals the secret through revenge.” So the superintendent of police was sent for, and the “council of ten” resolved upon the arrest of the unsuspecting Johnson. Frederick and Mary were together. They had just finished their simple supper, and were conversing; Fred. making new resolutions of amendment, and Mary, with her sweet smile, encouraging him in all. A knock was heard, and Johnson, opening it, ushered in Richard Martin. Dick fairly started back, on beholding the beautiful apparition that rose at her lover's introduction, to greet him. He advanced, and returned her salutation. “I have come to let you have the small sum I owe you,” said he to Fred. Mary cast a glance at Johnson. “I think I shall not need this sum, Richard,” said Frederick. “Not need it,” echoed Dick. “Surely, surely, Fred.—” “I do not wish it. You have nothing to fear from me, however.” “Can I speak a few words in private with you?” whispered Dick. “If you wish it.” He opened the door of a small apartment, and ushered Richard into it. “Martin,” said he, after the door was closed, “I do not want this money. I have given up my old principles, thank God! I wish you would.” Dick laughed. “You're going to peach, eh?” “No. But I'm changed from what I was.” “Well, I suppose your change will make you desert and betray your old friend.” “Not so; your secret is safe; at least so long as you are my friend.” “And do you not think I am your friend?” “I hope you are. But—” “And why will you not take this?” “I will not. But I will not betray you.” “Do you promise?” “I promise you, Dick.” “I'm satisfied. Now, Fred., is that the piece, eh? is that your Mary?” “It's my wife.” “Your wife, ha, ha! when did the ceremony take place?” “It shall take place to-morrow.” Dick smiled. “To-morrow!” thought he, and laughed within himself. They returned to the room in which they had left Mary. Richard talked and laughed a half hour; and fancied he had made a favorable impression. Mary listened to him, and he treated her with studious politeness, as if not aware of the position which she occupied. She was flattered by the attentions of her Frederick's tempter. She knew he was a villain; yet he was a pleasing one. Richard bade them farewell, and Fred. felt as if a load had been taken from his breast, for he had resisted Satan, “and he had fled from him.” “Thus you are free again, my Frederick,” murmured Mary; but as she spoke the door once more opened, and two men advanced. “Your name, sir,” was the first question addressed to Johnson. “Frederick Johnson I am called.” “You are our prisoner—” “For what am I arrested?” “Counterfeiting. Come, walk!” “He is not guilty. He has not committed it. Ye shall not arrest him,” were Mary's wild and rapid exclamations, as she flung herself upon the neck of Johnson. “That's gammon,” said one of the officers. But the other gently unclosed her fingers, and attempted to lead her away. But she uttered a wild shriek, and again her arms were clasped around the neck of her lover. Frederick spoke not; but he kissed the bloodless lips of his Mary, and pressed her to his heart. “Who has done this?” she cried. “It is the work of Stimson,” returned Frederick; “but calm yourself, dear Mary. They will release me soon.” Her hold relaxed around his neck. The officer quickly stretched out his hand, or she would have fallen. “She has fainted, sir,” said the officer, and his hard features wore a pitying expression, as he gazed on the loveliness he upheld. “Shall I lay her on the bed?” Frederick motioned him to do so. Then, bending over her he kissed her pale cheek. “Will you request the lady who lives beneath us to attend to her?” The officer left the room and returned with the woman. Frederick cast one more look at the form of his Mary, then he followed his conductors—to prison! Dick met the stranger, Stimson. Together they cracked a bottle of wine, and laughed over the fall of Johnson. Together they arranged the plan of a darker scheme. Then Dick went to bed, and slept—very soundly. Alas, poor Fred. To this had all his resolutions come. In this had his hopes and aspirations ended. He was in inmate of a dungeon—a prisoner, and a criminal. Three days had passed away—three long nights, too, of vigil and restlessness. What had been the fate of his Mary? Was she in the power of Stimson? He shuddered at the thought. The lock of the cell-door snapped, and the turnkey entered with a lady veiled. But Fred. knew at a glance his Mary, and extending his arms, with a cry of joy she sank within them. What a world is woman in herself! how mighty her influence for good or for evil!— Through this woman had come the change in Johnson's character. From the wild, careless, unprincipled youth he had become—in resolve, at least—an honorable man. And what a strange thing is the heart of a woman. It pours itself out in love for the depraved— the worthless of our sex; but within it, still, there lies the little leaven of good which will leaven the whole of man's vileness. Mary loved Fred. She saw not his faults when she loved him, and she fell. But from the depth she now strove to rise, and bear upward, on the wings of her love, her repentant lover. “Mary! this is kind, I had feared for you —has that villain Stimson—” “Alas, Frederick, there is a greater villain than him to fear.” “What mean you?” “O, Frederick—I have suffered so much— I have been wronged—insulted—” “Who has dared?—speak, Mary!” “Martin—hear me Frederick. He came to me on the morning after your arrest. He told me that he would conduct me to you. I was overjoyed at the offer—for I knew not whither they had dragged you. But—but—” “Go on, Mary—tell me—” “He brought a coach to the door; I entered it with him, and we were driven I know not where; I found myself among strangers, and—and—he insulted me—with the vilest propositions—O Frederick—would we had been married!” “He has not dared—” “He would have dared anything. I spurned him, for though fallen, I am not the wretched thing he deemed me. Three days was I confined, and insulted by the villain's—” “By the God of heaven he shall answer for this—I will—” “Let us leave him to the God of heaven,” said Mary—I have escaped—” “And how, Mary?” “This morning he came to me again. He renewed his infamous proposals. He told me you had been tried and sentenced—that I was alone, and helpless. I knew the villain lied—I told him so, and he was enraged—” “And—and—Mary—what—” “He swore that I should be his—I resisted him—I screamed, for he was strong, and a stranger rushed in, and—I—” “Was preserved, my Mary,—who was he?” “He led me from that dreadful place—I begged him to take me to the prison—he complied. He is below, now.” “I must see him —think him. Will you request the gentleman below to enter,” said Fred. to the jailor, who had remained outside the door. The turnkey withdrew, and returned with the stranger. Fred. gazed at him a moment, then springing forward he grasped his hand; “Ned Rifton?” cried he. “Ha, my dear Fred., is it you? Jove, my boy. I didn't know it—how are you—” “I will tell you all, Ned. But first let me thank you for my wife Ned, may—” “Hang it, don't mention it. But what a d—d rascal that Martin is, to be sure.— Why, I never could have believed it—but let's hear how you've got caged.” Again was the tale of crime repeated, and Ned Rifton grasped his friend's hand, as he concluded, and Mary turned her mild eyes on Fred., and he was strengthened.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XV. KATE. There is a tide in the affairs of women, Which, taken at the flood, leads —God knows where, Don Juan. “Dick Martin, you are in a scrape,” thought Richard, as he left the “assignation house,” after recovery from the effects of a blow which had prostrated him; a blow that had been dealt by the hand of Ned Rifton, and had rescued Mary from his clutches. He walked across the Common, and took his way to the store. It was ten o'clock, and he had not been there before that morning. Mr. Woodley greeted him rather harshly as he entered. “Hang it,” thought Dick, “should they find out, I should get small favor in that quarter.” The day wore away, and Richard was confined closely to the desk. Many and confused were the thoughts of the abandoned youth. He had been foiled in his attempts on the mistress of his friend, and he felt sore and revengful. He had recognised the rescuer of the girl, and with the thought of Ned Rifton, came the form of Kate Willis to his mind. “I'll try the girl; I'll be revenged on him. Ha, ha! Dick Martin, Boston'll soon be too hot to hold you. But, d—n it, when my jig's up, hurra for the Gulf of Mexico!” That night Dick visited Kate Willis. And she was pleased, for Martin knew well whom he dealt with, and his smile and his word were winning. There are moments in a woman's life, when the scale of her destiny is poised. This was Kate's. She had listened to the tempter, for he promised her revenge. For what? for Ned's coldness, which she herself had caused. Yet to herself she would not own it. Ned Rifton had deserted her—so Richard assured her—he had spoken slightingly of her to his friends; he had boasted of his easy conquest. Richard lied not there, and Kate vowed revenge. “He never loved me.” “Rifton in love, dear Kate? I know him too well.” As Dick said this his arm was round Kate's neck, and his lips close to her warm cheek. Her heart beat fast— * * * Richard left Kate Willis an hour after. “You're a lucky dog, Dick Martin,” muttered he to himself, “You were born under Venus.” As Dick passed from the house of Kate Willis, a figure passed him which he recognised. He turned, and followed it to the door he had just quitted. It was Ned Rifton. Dick heard him ascend the stairs that conducted to her room. Kate was seated upon the sofa, and rose to meet her quondam lover. He took her hand, and led her to a seat. “Kate,” said he, “I once loved you; I imagined it was returned, but I was deceived.” “No, no! not deceived, not deceived, Edward!” cried the guilty girl. She thought of Richard Martin, and buried her face in her hands. “Martin can best tell that. Yes, you have deceived me, Kate. I have come to bid you farewell!” “Edward, no!” “But beware of that Martin. As I once loved you, as I love you still, Kate, I warn you. He is a scoundrel, whose crimes will to-morrow be exposed. “Edward, Edward! you will not leave me. Martin is not what you suppose—he— he loves me.” Loves you, Kate? ha, ha! But tell me— speak—he—” Ned could not finish the sentence. Kate looked at him with a vacant air; she seemed to wait for him to speak. “He is a villain, Kate Willis; a villain of the deepest die; he has tempted others to crime, only to desert them; he has consigned his friend to a prison, and attempted the honor of that friend's wife—” “This is not Richard.” “It is true, by heaven! Kate, promise me you will guard yourself against this man. He will ruin you.” “Oh, Edward Rifton, spurn me from you. I am lost! I am fallen! I love him not. But—but—” She sank insensible at the feet of her astonished visiter. Ned raised her from the floor. As he did so, the door opened, and Richard Martin entered. With an oath on his lip, Ned sprang to his feet, and confronted the clerk. “Villain!” came to his lips. “But you have not long to run.” Dick laughed. “Before to-morrow, may-hap, you nor your d—d fool of a friend, Johnson, will be able to track Dick Martin, ha, ha! I heard your fine story, my dear friend Ned.” Ned rushed forward, and grasped the throat of Dick. “Unhand me, Ned Rifton, if you please.” “You stir not from here, sir, but to prison; your tune's up, my friend,” said Ned, compressing the clerk's neck with the grasp of a vice. Dick quietly drew a pistol from his pocket, and pointed it at the breast of Rifton. “No, my dear Ned, you had much better take care of `ma chere amie' on the floor there,” said he, pointing to the still insensible form of Kate Willis; “women of such easy virtue”—Ned started and his hand dropped—“need a protector against the `villain Martin.' ” “What mean you?” “What I say---that Dick Martin found as much favor with Kate as most husbands do with their better halves, ha, ha, ha!” And with a sweep of his arm, Dick sprang to the door, and disappeared. Ned bent over the reviving Kate, and she awoke; awoke to her guilt. Truly, she was revenged; and such is the revenge of the sex—their own ruin!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XVI. NEW YORK. A weed, Flung from the rock, on ocean's foam to sail Where'er the surge may sweep, the tempest's breath prevail. Childe Harold At eight o'clock, the next morning, the dull beams of a winter sun shone on a little schooner, sailing with a spanking breeze from the harbor of Boston. On board were two individuals previously favorably known to the reader; their names were Richard Martin, and our friend Stimson. At nine o'clock the affidavit of Frederick Johnson to the robbery of Abbot &amp; Co., was on file in the town court. Away went the little bark over the blue waters. Stimson unfolded carefully the plan of his contemplated villany. “How much l'argent do you at present possess, my young friend?” asked he of Dick, with a winning smile. “A couple of hundreds.” “Which will give you a genteel fit-out in the piratical line.” “Piratical?” “Ay, you did not think that mutiny was our only object. No, my boy, a few years cruising in the Main will fill our pockets, and then we can hoist colors for one of the five hundred republics of South America, and with a commission, sail scot free. Hey, my boy, what say you?” “Why can we not hoist colors at first, and procure a commission, it'll be safer.” “Don't you see? Well, they're all by the ears now, and it would puzzle a Philadelphia lawyer to tell which will beat. So, we free boys of the ocean will prey on all, and declare for the one that fights longest— ho!” “A fine plan if we don't fail in the outset.” “Fail, my boy! there's no such a word in the almanac I go by; no, our way is clear; only be firm, and don't stick, and your fortune's made.” “And yours marred,” thought Dick—and then, he plotted in his thoughts his own schemes, for he hated the man with whom he had linked himself, and revenge was his god. New York burst upon them—New York, with its thousand ships, and its thousand warehouses—its merchant-princes, and its pauper-villains. New York was before them; the light skiffs, the swift steamboats plying for pleasure or profit, the turmoil of a great city's crowd—the voice of a mighty traffic “See you that neat-built craft, that sits like a duck in the water, with the black yards, and the long pennon streaming from her topmast?” Richard cast his eye in the direction indicated; “that,” said Stimson, as the two gazed from the schooner's quarter deck— “that's the Halcion, our ship, my boy.” The schooner sped along, and passed, broadside to, the vessel Stimson had pointed out. She was indeed a goodly craft. Her white taper masts contrasted strongly with the sable hue of her fairy spars. Her long sharp build, and low draught, marked her as “Baltimore built,” and she swayed up and down at every heave of the waves, like a swan rocked to sleep by her own watery cradle. Every thing was “taught-drawn,” “ship-shape.” She was a craft for a sailor to love. “Yes, that's our ship, and with brave hearts and firm nerves, d—n it, my friend, our fortune's in our own hands.” Dick answered not. The schooner soon hauled up, and the two worthies took their course for their quarters. They preceeded up Peck Slip, and striking through the city, directed their steps to the eastern side, then, as now, a sort of Alsatia for the mass of rascals who infest the metropolis. At the corner of Fish street, they stopped, and Stimson, leading the way, conducted Richard to the upper part of a house, whose time-worn sign-board, as it swung on its rusty crane, gave forth the intimation that this was the “Pipe and Bowl” Inn. They traversed a long entry, and Stimson, after listening a moment at a door, made known his presence by three smart raps upon its pannel. It was opened by a young man, clad in a short sea-jacket, his linen entirely guiltless of the christian ordinance of baptism. “Halcion,” said Stimson. “Come in,” said the man, and then, as they entered, he held up the lamp to scrutinize their features, for the entry, entirely destitute of windows, rendered a lamp, although it was broad daylight without, indispensable within. “Ha, captain, is it you?” cried the engaging janitor,—“when did you spring?” “Five bells,” said Stimson, “but who's ashore; I'm half frozen, and hungry enough to eat a horse. Heave away, and overhaul the bread-locker.” “Ay, ay! come along,” said the man, and opening another door, he ushered them into a room, where were four others seated round a table, discussing the merits of a steaming bowl of punch that sent up its fragrance to the olfactories of the visitors. They all rose as Stimson entered, and shaking his hand, poured out a confused volley of oaths and welcomings, which almost stunned the ears of the sensitive Dick. “I'll tell you all, my hearties, in a jiffey, but give way there, till I make you acquainted with a new comrade; here, my boys is Dick Martin—true blue—staunch to the backbone. What do you say—Dick—we're a jolly crew.” “Bear a hand with the grog, Jim,” cried Dick, “I always sail best with a deep cargo.” “Hurra for Dick Martin, he's the boy,” cried the sailors, who were taken with Dick's joke, and his frank manner. “Thank you, my hearties; here's halcion days for all of us.” The toast was drunk with vehement applause; scarcely one in the company understood what it meant, only the “halcion” pleased them; and then Dick, ensconseing himself in a vacant seat, was as deep in punch, pipes, and plotting as the oldest of them. “When do we sail?” asked Stimson of an old tar, with a long pigtail, and a deep scar over his left eye. He had been a pirate with Lafitte. “Vy, that sall be as se vind sall go,” answered the man; “if it sall blow east, vy, ve sail to-morar, and if—” “D—n your ifs; when did the captain tell you to be on board.” “Tomorar, sare, tomorar.” “Be on hand, my hearties, then,” said Stimson; “we sail to-morrow, probably; you will be in your stations. Tusker,” continued he, glancing at a large, heavy-built man, who had been smoking a long meerschaum, in utter abstraction, “Tusker will go with us, in the cabin-passengers. Look here boys, listen.” The jingle of the glasses ceased instantly, and there was a dead silence. It was evident that Stimson possessed as much control over the rest as he had attained over the cidevant clerk. “We shall sail to-morrow: now, mark me, in eight-and-forty hours from the time we pass the Narrows, with a stiff breeze, the Halcion must be ours. What say you, boys?” “Ay, ay! hurra for Captain Spanker.” “A new name,” thought Dick. “Captain Spanker,” shouted he, “Captain Spanker forever!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XVII. BATTLE OF CARABOBO. When even the Spaniard's thirst of gold and war, Forgets Pizarro to shout Bolivar. —Byron. It was in the early summer of 1821, and near the town of Carabobo the army of the South American republicans, under Bolivar, had encamped, awaiting the command of their general to attempt the dislodgement of the enemy from their entrenchments in the almost impregnable mountain-fastnesses. Around a watchfire, at one of the outposts, a party of Republican officers were engaged in conversation. “You are certain that Paez is in Varinas?” asked a tall officer in the uniform of Bolivar's staff, of another, whose bluff, careless air, plainly discovered him to be one of the trans-atlantic adventurers who had joined the army, and whose valor had mainly contributed to its success “Ay, by me sowl,” answered he, with a 3 rich Irish brogue; “and with as fine a set of barelegged llaneros, as ever throttled a wild-bull. Och! he's a broth of a by, that same Paez. But when does the gineral intind to make a clane swape of the dirty blackguards up there?” continued the Irishman, pointing with his sword, to the far-off fires in the mountains, “Mr. Diego?” “At day-break,” answered Don Diego,— “and you are on the vanguard.” “Thank his excellency for that same,” said the Irishman. “Who leads?” “The General himself.” “Before Paez comes up, Mr. Diego?” “Se, Senor O'Callagan,” said a voice, and another officer advanced towards them. “Ah, how are you, Major Mina? good luck to you; where's our young frind, the liftinant?” “He is here,” said Mina, and at the same moment a young officer made his appearance, beneath whose white plume, still shone the blue eyes of Henry Fowler. “I am here, my good O'Callagan,” giving his hand to the officer. “And Major Mina,” said he, turning to one whom the reader will recognize as the captain whose life Henry had saved in the streets of Boston, “We are on the attack to-morrow.” “Ah, 'tis well, amigo. We must prepare, buonos noches cavalero,” said he, touching his cap to Captain O'Callagan. “Swate slape till the trumpit sounds,” answered the captain. And Mina left the watchfire. “Captain,” said Henry, as he seated himself, “I have something to request of you?” “And you can do that, my darlint, asily?” “You have always, since I joined the army of Bolivar, expressed an interest in me.” “Niver mind that, me young soldier, sure aren't you a 'Mirican of the ould states of Washington?” asked O'Callagan, using a term by which the South American Republicans designated the North American Union. “But you have never heard why I left the States, and it is time you should,” said Fowler, and he proceeded to narrate to his Irish friend the story of his life, up to the time we left him. “It was through the influence of Captain Mina,” continued he, “that I have become the favorite with our general, and an officer of his staff. “When we arrived at Callao, the castles were still in the possession of the Spaniards, and Captain Mina resolved then to put into operation a plan he had long contemplated; to join the Republicans, and strike one blow, at least, for the freedom of his country. But he generously gave me my choice to proceed with him to the camp, or remain in a situation which he would procure me in one of the seaports. I had but one desire—to win an honorable name—and I resolved to follow him. We arrived at the camp; you were the first, my dear captain, to take by the hand the young volunteer—” “Yes, and a lucky take it was for me, maybe you forget the sabre-cut that you got instead of meself at the battle of Coronas.” “No matter for that, captain. But what I ask of you is this, as I may not survive to-morrow's action; will you bear the tidings of my fate to my friends—my sister?” “Och! don't be talking of dying; ye're worth twinty dead min, yet, me young liftinant.” “But I may fall, captain, and Mina may never again visit North America. Will you promise me, captain?” “It's I that'll do whativer you ask,” said the captain. “But don't spake of dying; for if a dirty bullet should be after shaping its course for you, by St. Patrick! it must first make a hole in Dinnis O'Callagan.” “Thanks! my kind friend,” said Fowler, as he drew his cloak around him, and returned to the General's quarters. The morning had not yet broken, when the army of Bolivar was in motion. Paez was still in Varinas, and it was not probable he would come up with the main army in season to join in the attack, with his mountain llaneros. Nevertheless General Bolivar determined to attempt the passage of the heights, and Cedeno was despatched to reconnoitre. General La Torre, the Spanish commander, had entrenched himself strongly among the almost inaecessible cliffs, and defended in person the only pass through the mountains—a Thermopylæ which a handful might have defended, and which the numbers of the Spaniards seemed to make indeed impregnable. “We shall have hot work, captain,” said Fowler. “Throth, I think it; you're in the van?” “With the staff.” “Thin I'll be near ye. But, gallop! there's the trumpit,” and putting spurs to their horses, the two friends parted. There was in Bolivar's army, a battalion composed entirely of English and Irish, in which Captain O'Callagan held his command. Fowler, through the influence of his friend Mina, and his knowledge of the language, for which he was also indebted to the instructions of the major, had obtained a place near the person of Bolivar, as a lieutenant of the general's staff. The attack commenced. Oh, it was a glorious sight! those brave men, mounting the rocks with steady march, in the teeth of the deadly and masked batteries. Rank after rank was swept away by the fiery hail, and still the trumpet sounded the attack. At once La Torre and his grenadiers emerged from among the rocks. Like a torrent he bore down upon the assailants! Back —back they rolled! Only one firm phalanx withstood the rushing stream. It was the Irish battalion, and the clear voice of O'Callagan rose high above the din of the fray. “Stiddy, my boys! strike for the honor uv the green Isle!” “Strike for the name of the three kingdoms!” cried a brave Englishman to his countrymen; “back, and drive the Spanish dogs to their kennels!” “Strike for the glory of the Stars and Stripes!” shouted a Kentuckian, where a small band, from Yankee-land, from the middle States, and from the West, sustained the hottest of the assault. As the rock withstands the lashing waves, the brave battalion kept back the advancing Spaniards. La Torre himself led on his men, but in vain. Far down the mountain fled the scattered Republicans, in wild disorder. But still the brave foreigners, behind a rampart of their dead comrades, maintained the unequal battle. Bolivar, from a height, and surrounded by his staff, surveyed the rout of his native troops. He saw the battalion of foreigners make its gallant stand, and his heart revived again. “Forward, gentlemen, to the rescue!” shouted he, waving his sword, and plunging from the height. Mina and Fowler dashed after the general. They gained the ravine, and Cedeno met them. “All is lost!” “Back, back, ye cowards!” shouted Bolivar, as he passed the flying throngs; “shall the strangers achieve our freedom?” The scattered Republicans rallied at the trumpet-tones of their leader's voice. Bolivar dashed forward, into the melee, followed by the animated troops. The plain of Tinaquillo presented one vast battle-field. Foot to foot, breast to breast—the opposing forces fought, and disputed every inch of ground. At once a rush—a sweep—and the General was separated from his officers. A Spaniard's sword waved over his head—a bullet struck the neck of his horse, and the brave steed staggered beneath his master.— Mina sprang forward, and a sabre-cut brought him to the earth. The General's fate seemed certain; a dozen bayonets were at his breast, the hail of musket-balls fell fast around him. “To the rescue!” shouted Henry Fowler to the Irish captain, who, forced to retreat from the rocks, had just reached the scene; “Bolivar is in danger.” “Come on, thin,” was the response of O'Callagan, and together they plunged to the rescue of the chief. A timely stroke levelled a Spaniard who had aimed his knife at the back of Bolivar, and enabled the General to mount the horse of the lieutenant. Taking the fallen Mina in their arms the Republican officers now fought their retreat, while the enemy, elated with their success, pressed on with new vigor. At once a trumpet was heard far up in the mountains. It was the signal-blast of Paez, who stopping not to join the army of Cedeno and Anzuategui, had dashed boldly on to dispossess the Spaniards of the heights.— Like a hurricane he swept at the head of his wild llaneros through the dangerous pass. The frowning batteries stopped not his course. On he dashed, and the terror-stricken foe, fled far before him. It was his blast of victory that Bolivar heard in the mountains.— The battle was gained, and La Torre completely routed, ere the Commander-in-chief was aware that Paez had passed him. A glorious scene, the plain of Tinaquillo preseated the morning after the battle of Calabobo. The host of La Torre were scattered, and the banners of liberty waved from every height, that was crowned the day before by the batteries of the Royalists. “Senor Americano,” said the General; “I owe my life to you; you are a captain; henceforth, be this your country, and Bolivar your friend forever! “To the brave Paez, Republican soldiers, we owe this day's victory. On the field of battle I make him major-general of the army of liberty. “To you, brave, undaunted foreigners,” continued Bolivar, turning to O'Callagan, and the English and Irish troops, who were drawn up behind the staff, “For you, let your brave band be forever called `the Battalion of Carabobo.” A shout rose up, from the troops, and the voice of O'Callagan cried, “long live Bolivar.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XVIII. THE MUTINEERS. O'er the glad waters of the dark blue sea, Our sonls as boundless and our thoughts as free, Far as the breeze can bear, the billows foam, Survey our empire and behold our home. —Corsair The Halcion left the waters of New York, with the conspirators on board. Captain Lewis, her master, was a blunt, careless sea-man, who took the world as it came. He had toiled long in the minor grades of the merchant service, and this was the first ship he had commanded. “Mr. Richards,” said he, addressing one of his passengers, “was you ever at sea before?” “No,” said our friend Dick, “it's my first voyage. It was at the urgent request of my friend Nichols here,” continued he, pointing to Stimson, who walked the quarter-deck, “that I have come on board. He fears for my health.” The villains laid their schemes well. The crew of the Halcion consisted of eight men. Of these, four were leagued with Stimson, and three more associates, in the character of passengers, occupied with Stimson and Martin the after cabin. The chief rascal had taken the name of Nichols, and Martin was called by that of Richards. The vessel was three days out from the harbor of New York, when the rising took place. It was all over in an hour. Captain Lewis was stabbed in his berth; two of the crew joined the pirate; the mate and one seaman, as Stimson expressed it, “carried the news to Neptune.” In eighty hours from the time the Halcion left the wharf, a fearful crime had been committed on her decks; a bloody deed planted a new banner on her topmast—the flag of the pirate-captain Spanker. Richard Martin had wellnigh attained the topmost round in the ladder of villany. He had plunged his knife to the heart of an innocent man, and given his hand to the chief of an outlaw crew. Truly he was an apt scholar. Six months the pirate cruised on the Spanish Main, and gained a harvest of blood and gold. But Richard was not one to play the second to a greater villain. Twice had his temper broken out, when the pirate captain's aims had clashed with his own, and already had the crew taken sides; Richard's promises had sapped the regard they had for their commander. There was an old Spaniard on board who had joined the ship at Florida; a dark, designing man, forever plotting, who had passed his life in acts of villany; and with him Richard Martin had tampered, till they had conceived a new conspiracy. In the memory of the young villain there still shone the star of a better day — the image of one whom, when a boy, he had loved, as far as his bad heart was capable of affection. It was his orphan foster-sister, Fanny Fowler. It was she who had first attracted his eye when the budding of her youthful beauty had made her a rich object to possess. He could not bear for the sweet orphan the absorbing love of a brave and generous soul, but the passion of a wild heart had nourished itself into intensity, and as he hourly dwelt on the recollection of the young maiden, he resolved that he should one day possess her. This had prompted him the night of the assault on the Mexican captain, to wrench from Fowler's neck the ken which he knew his fellow-clerk hel dear and sacred—the locket of his sister's hair. And, mingled with his dark plots with his Spanish associate, came the thought of soon possessing the lovely orphan girl. It was the third watch, and the lights were out in the forecastle of the pirate-bark. Stimson lay asleep in the after cabin, his pistols, as was his wont, beneath his pillow, and his cutlass chained to his wrists, for such is the happy security of suceessful crime. At once a slight noise aroused the watchful captain; his quick eyes unclosed, and bending over him was the form of Richard Martin; he sprang from the bed, and grasped his pistols. “What mean you, Martin?” “Nothing, but that I command this craft, now.” “Rebel—take that!” cried Stimson, as he discharged his pistol at the head of his lieutenant. Richard laughed. “You forgot to charge with ball eartridge,” said he. “Mutiny, by heaven!” shouted Stimson, and grasping his eutlass, he sprang upon the traitor. But a swift blow met his. The dagger of the Spanish sailor pierced his heart. The Pirate chief fell dead at the feet of his treacherous lieutenant. “Ha!” cried Martin, springing to the door of the magazine, as the crew, aroused by the pistol-shot, poured into the cabin. “My boys! behold Spanker, who would have murdered me but for this brave man. Will you sail with me, or shall I blow the ship to hell, by firing my pistol there?” and he levelled it at the open magazine. “Hurra! hurra! for Captain Martin,” cried a voice. “The booty that we take is the crew's; the beauty shall be your captain's. What say you, my hearties?” “Hurra for Captain Martin, our brave commander,” was the response. “Then chuck this dead dog over the taffrail, and let the liquor run. What say you my boys? we'll make a night of it.” “Hurra for Captain Martin, and death to mutineers!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XIX. THE ABDUCTION. Brave comrades, we wait but the favoring gales, With a spring on our eables, a bend on our sails. The Buccanneer She is won! we are gone! —Scott. It was a beautiful Spring-morning, and Fanny Merton, as the sister of Henry Fowler was now called, wandered, flower-gathering, with her dear friend, Lucia Abbot, along the banks of the Merrimac river. Lucia had been for a month on a visit at her aunt's, and the two girls had conceived a strong affection for each other. Together they had climbed the dark old Powow hill, together they had glided over the smooth waters of the bay, and together had they talked of the lost Henry. Too late had Mr. Abbot learned his error, when the confessions of Frederick Johnson, and the flight of Martin, had revealed the true villain. Lucia had wept and laughed by turns. “I knew he was innocent,” she cried to her mother; “Henry would never have committed such a crime.” Mr. Abbot had taken every step to bring to justice the offender. But he had escaped, and the merchant could only regret his too easy credulity. Frederick Johnson had made a full and free confession, and through the influence and exertions of his friend Rifton, and Mr. Abbot, he had been pardoned. “And William has come home again?” said Fanny, inquiringly, to her young friend. “Yes, but he is soon to leave again. Oh, Fanny, I wish every one we love, would stay with us; but I suppose that is impossible.” “Where is he going, Lucia?” “To South America; he is to be supercargo, I believe they call it, of one of father's ships. Father says his health requires a sea voyage. “But he will soon return, dear Lucia.” “Yes, in a few months. Oh, I wish our dear Henry would come with him.” The orphan sighed. “But perhaps he will meet with him.” “Oh, yes,” cried Lucia, catching eagerly at the thought; “wouldn't it be delightful if William should bring him home.” At this moment, a man approached the speakers. He came from towards the water and was dressed in sailor garments, apparently a seaman belonging to one of the numerous craft that nestled in the snug harbor of Newburyport. Doffing his hat, he made a low bow, and looking at the astonished girls, said, “Mayhap I address the sister of Henry Fowler--” “Henry, Henry!” cried Fanny, darting forward, and seizing the man's hand; “what of my brother, sir? Oh, tell me!” “He's alive and well. The captain has a letter from him. I've been watching you since you came from that great house on the hill,” said the sailor, pointing to the mansion of Mrs. Merton, which, from a high point on the east side of the town, overlooked the waters of the harbor. “And why did you not bring it to me?” asked Fanny, anxiously. “I doesn't like to overhaul them front doors,” answered the man, rolling his quid of tobacco in his mouth, “and captain said I must see Miss Fanny herself, and give her this; be said you'd know what it meant;” and he took from his pocket a little packet. Fanny eagerly seized and unrolled it. It was a little locket, and in it was a lock of her own hair, which she had braided when she last parted from her brother. It was the same locket which Fowler had missed from his neck the Right of his rescue of Captain Mina. Richard Martin had snatched it, as he retreated from the crowd. “Oh, Lucia! brother sent it. Where is he; when will he come, sir?” “As to the matter of that, Miss, I can't say; but the captain has got a letter for you.” “Oh, tell him to bring it to one, do; can he not, to-night?” “He said if I saw the young lady to ax her to walk down to the shore to-morrow, and he would meet her and give it to her.” “There is some mystery in this business,” said Lucia, advancing; “why does not your captain come to the house, and deliver his letter?” “Why, to tell you blunt,” said the man, with an apparent air of frankness, “our ship is a privateer in the South-service, and the captain doesn't like to come on shore much; it's rather dangerous. But he's a friend of your brother, I take it, Miss, and won't stop to serve him. At any rate, I'll ax him to go to the house, if you won't tell what the craft is.” “O thank you, thank you, sir,” said Fanny, “we won't say a word.” “But you'd better come down to the shore, howsomdever,” said the sailor. “Mayhaps I can get the letter myself,” continued he, as he took a new plug of tobacco, and turned away. The girls hurried home together, to talk and weep over the lock of hair, and imagine and dream what would be the contents of the letter. Alas for golden antieipations! Mr. Abbot was seated in his parlor, lefsurely smoking a cigar, for, like all sensible old gentlemen, he knew what was good to settle his dinner. All at once a carriage drove to the door, and the next moment Lucia was in his arms. “Bless me! returned, my child! and what is the matter?” said he, observing the traces of tears on his daughter's cheeks. “Oh, father—father—poor Fanny!” was all she could utter. “What of Fanny, my child; what has happened?” “Oh, I cannot—here, here is aunt's letter; Fanny is murdered!” “Murdered! bless us! murdered! What do you mean, Lucia? Let me see the letter.” Lucia with a trembling hand produced it. My dear Brother:—Providence has seen fit to afflict us in a peculiar manner.— Our dear Fanny has been abducted; carried we know not whither. A message, purporting to be from Henry Fowler, came to her a few days since. The man who brought it gave her a locket from her brother and requesting her to meet him on the shore not a hundred rods from our house, and receive a letter from her brother. The thoughtless girl, without consulting me, repaired there. Lucia accompanied her. She will tell you the rest. My poor Fanny! I can write no more. Will you use every means to regain her. Lucia tells me that Richard Martin, your clerk, was there. Your afflicted sister, Maria Merton. Mr. Abbot for sometime was silent with amazement. “Martin!” cried he at last “Lucia, tell me more of this. What are the circumstances? What have the villains done?” As soon as Lucia could, she related her story. They had met the stranger on the beach, accompanied by another man. He gave the delighted Fanny a letter, and ere she could read a line, she was seized by his companion and borne shrieking to the boat. Lucia mingled her eries with Fanny's, and fled to the house for succor. When she returned with assistance, the boat was no where to be found. Mrs. Merton and her friends made every exertion to rescue the lost girl. Boats were immediately despatched down the harbor, but the villains had escaped to their ship, and with a smart breeze were already standing from the bay. Porsuit with the heavy and unprepared craft then in the harbor was useless, and the boats were quickly left behind. There was no cutter to overtake them, and the pirate bark escaped with her prize. “And why do you,” said the father, when Lucia had finished her narration, “why do you think Richard--” “I saw him, father. It was he who seized my dear Fanny. I knew him, and he knew me.” “Knew you, Lucia?” “Yes, father; he gave me a terrible look. It was Richard Martin. I knew it, father. Poor Fanny! he will murder her.” What a thing is crime. Successful and glorious. It carries all before it. The murderer attains his object. The seducer attains his object. It gave Dick Martin money, power, freedom, love. Had he remained an honest clerk, he might have starved on his paltry salary. Ho, ho! for your Robinsons, your Averys, and your Edwardses. Ho! ho! for the merry hell-dance!</field>

      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XX THE CAPTURE. A sail, a sail! a promised prize to hope— Mernation. flag—how speaks the telescope. —Corsair. The vessel, in which William Abbot, nominally as supercargo, had sailed for the bene fit of his health—which long confinement to close study had impaired—left the port the day on which his sister returned with the sad intelligence of the abduction of the orphan Fanny. He knew not of it, nor suspected; for a letter, received a few days before from his sister, had assured him of the health and happiness of his cousin, as she fondly called her. William remembered with affection the sweet sister of his exiled friend, for he had heard her light laugh in his summer holiday spent with his aunt, and her bright smile had often rewarded his venturesome ascent of the tall chestnut-trees, to shake the ripe fruit into her out-spread hands. Sad and heavy would his heart have been had be known of the orphan's misfortune. The good ship Garland lay tossed in the Gulf-stream, and ten days the weary mariners beheld the swift sails passing and repassing before the favoring gales, while their own was forced to lay becalmed, or driven at the mercy of the current in a perpetual circle. But at last a breeze sprung up, and before it the ship stood gallantly on her course. William had passed the monotonous hoars in thoughts of his distant friends, and hailed with joy the time when the wind bore the ship on her homeward passage. “A sail, a sail!” “Where away?” “On the windward.” It was a Baltimore-built vessel, and she bore down on them with a race-horse speed, while her fore-foot dipped in the high waves, like a dolphin in his gambollings. “A pirate, by heaven!” cried the captain, as a heavy lee-gun sent its iron messenger across his bows, and a bluck flag rose slowly to the top of the stranger's slender foremast. “We must fight,” continued he, as he turned and beheld at his side the youthful supercargo. “We must,” said William. Another gun sent its summons from the pirate's quarter. Captain Dalton sprang upon the taffrail, and bailed the stranger through his trumpet. “What ship is that?” “Lay to, or we sink you,” was the thundering response, and a shot struck the bows of the Garland. “Boys! do you hear that?” cried Captain Dalton; “shall a Yankee ship be taken by a bloody pirate?” Three cheers rose from the hardy crew, and in the twinkling of an eye the signal-guns were hoisted from the hold, and their muzzles run through the ship's portholes. At the same time the arms were distributed and a dozen men stood on the ships bows, to repel the boarding attack which they knew the approximation of the two vessels would bring on. The Garland had not slackened her course, but the light craft of the pirate was already abreast, and in the wind's eye, was bringing her broadside to bear. At once the beavens grew dark with clouds and a long, loud, distant peal of thunder shook the sky. There was a heavy flapping of the ship's sails, as the breeze which had borne her along died suddenly away, aud she lay motionless upon the water. The Gulfstorm was at hand, and a mantle of thick fog fell around them. At the same instant the pirate bark hove broadside to, beside the Garland, and a peal of musketry from a score of her fierce crew, rattled through the ship's rigging It was returned—and the cheering shout of the brave Captain Dalton, inspired his willing men. The pirates were two to one, and their captain, waving a cutlass over his head, led them to the attack. Three times the grappling irons rang against the Garland's side—three times the cry of the pirate chief, —“Boarders away!”—impelled his followers to the bulwarks—and three times—while the thunder rolled above their heads, and the thick darkness was only lit by the vivid flashes of lightning that burst from the low clouds around them—did the brave Americans beat back their ruthless foes! The pirate captain gaashed his teeth, as for the last time he fell back upon his quarter deck. “Once more!” shouted he; “there's not a dozen left, to drive beneath the hatches. Halcions, away!” and the shrill boarding-whistle was again applied to his lips. On they bore, and like a torrent poured over the Garland's side. Dalton and William fought side by side—the pirate chief sprang first upon the quarter-deck, and his cutlass crossed with the sword of the Yankee captain. Dalton, a strong and powerful man, bore down upon his antagonist; his blows fell like rain upon the pirate blade; and the latter retreated step by step towards the midship melee. At once a bright flash, and a quick clap, gleamed and rattled above them, and the ship's topmast, with its vent flag, came crashing to the deck; she had been struck by lighteing. Dalton, astounded, ceased his strokes, and the pirate's sword fell upon his head. He sunk upon the deck, while the shout of the pirate, as he rushed forward, gave new vigor to his victorious crew. Another flash—another peal—and the dark clouds fell away as suddenly as they had risen; a stiff breeze filled the unfurled sails, and, bearing down upon them, the mingled combatants beheld a Colombian privateer. The flag of the republic stood out from her white topmast, and William, springing from the throng, upon the quarter-deck, waved his own tarn flag in his hand, and beckoned to her crew. But they had already beheld the scene, and with a sudden bend, the privateer bore down and hove to, beside the Garland, and while the iron grapnels fixed themselves in the side of the Yankee ship, a crowd of Republican sailors pozred over her bulwark, and attacked the pirate victors. The pirates were taken almost by surprise, and a vigorous rally of the Garland's crew, forced them to retreat to their own vessel. William engaged hand to hand with the corsair-captain. Exeited by the fall of Dalton, he resolved to revenge it, and pressed hravely on his opponent. A well directed thrust the pirate warded off, but as he did so, his broad slouchy hat fell off, revealed the face of Richard Martin. “Ha!” cried William, and, thunderstruck, his arm fell by his side. The pirate saw his advantage, and rushed upon him. William raised his arm, and caught the descending blow; but his sword flew shivered from his hand, and he sunk upon his knee. Martin raised his arm. A shriek was heard—a woman's cry—and a light airy form sprang up the companion way. A pistol shot rang in William's car and he beheld Richard Martin reel, and fall upon the deck. The bullet had struck his sword-arm, even as it was descending on the supercargo's head.— The next moment, the sister of his lost friend was in the arms of William Abbot, and a loud shout from the Colombian sailors told the pirate crew's surrender. Before the swift homeward breeze sped the rescued ship, to the home of William Abbot. And to her brave deliverer Fanny told the story of her capture; how the villain had talked to her of love and had sworn she should be his; how she had resisted, and how the cry from the deck of “a sail—ho!” had summoned the pirate from his prize. Then she told how the loud roar of the thunder, the din of the fight, and the oaths of the wounded pirates had appalled her. And then, how she flew to the deck, and beheld the pirate aiming the death-blow at the head of William Abbot. And William clasped the fair girl in his arms, and expressed his gratitude for the timely shot that had saved his life. Oh, a happy voyage was the homeward-passage of William Abbot and his betrothed Fanny</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XXI. BOLIVAR'S ENTRY. First came the trumpet at whose clang So late the forest echoes rang; On prancing steeds they forward pressed. His thoughts I scan not, but I ween, The meanest groom in all the hall Would not have been their prey —Scott The streets of Bogota were thronged with exulting crowds. Bolivar, the president, was about making his entry into the city, and the voice of a liberated people sent up its loud welcome. At the head of the cortege rode Santander, the vice president of the Republic, and then preceded by the bravest of his officers, came Bolivar. By his side was Cedeno and Anzuategui, and the brave Irish captain, now Major O'Callagan, followed by the “Battalion of Carabobo,” brought up the rear. Henry Fowler, in the white plume and starry searf of the general's guard, rode on one side of the coach of Bolivar, while Mina, recovered from the wound he had received on the plain of Tinaquillo, occupied the same position on the other. “Viva la Libertador!” “Viva Bolivar!” were the cries of the mighty crowd, and from the balconies, white arms waved the flag of the Republic, and fairy fingers scattered flowers on the heads of the victorious troops. But Henry felt not the joy and the exultation. Though his heart beat high at the shouts of liberty, as he felt that his own arm had fought for it, yet his thoughts were of his own distant and happy land, of his sweet orphan sister, and of the bright and loving Lucia. At the great square of Bogota, a band of the city's guards drawn up around the gate of a large building, attracted the attention of the youthful captain. In their midst were a dozen men chained together, their dark and scowling faces strongly contrasting with the joyous countenances of the shouting populace. “What means this?” asked Fowler of an officer of Bogota, who rode beside him. “Pirates, senor, taken in a sea-engagement, off Cicuta. There are Americans among them, of the North.” Fowler answered not. His eyes were riveted on one who appeared to be the captain of the pirates. The prisoner raised his head, as Fowler's horse tramped by him.— Their eyes met. “Richard Martin!” “Henry Fowler, by heaven!” And such they were. The one a condemned pirate—the other the favored officer of the chief of a free nation. The thoughts of the ruffian clerk ran back through his dark career of crime, and he gnashed his teeth in rage. Henry Fowler rode on; but the form of his fellow-clerk was before his mind's eye, and the thought of his first benefactress—of her death-bed—and the silent committal of her son to his protection. “He is guilty— he has wronged me!” murmured the orphan, “but his mother was my friend, and the friend of my mother!” And what thought Richard. When wounded and disabled, he had beheld the capture of his ship, and, bound with chains, he had been marched from the seaboard, he had cursed his evil fate, and his victorious foes. Then had succeeded a quiet despair, a hopelessness of escape, yet a sullen indifference to his fate. Such were his feelings when, amid the proud and the powerful army of Bolivar, appeared the friend he had wronged—the orphan, Henry Powler. Then came a quick hope of escape; could he not gain a pardon through his firm friend —might he not work upon him? Well he knew the gratitude that lived in the bosom of Henry for the widow Martin's kindly care. “He shall release me, ha, ha!” said the pirate, and despair fled at his laugh. And Richard argued well. Henry could not desert the son of his more than mother. Bolivar had returned from the council-chamber, and was alone. A page appeared. “Captain Fowler desires admittance.” “Ah, the brave young American; let him enter.” Henry advanced, and the general grasped his hand; “always welcome, senor.” Henry bowed; “I have come to ask a favor, senor President.” “Speak; if in my power, it shall be granted.” “Some pirates have been brought hither from the sea-board where they were taken.— The captain, as I suppose, is one who was once my friend—my school-mate. I would save him. He is sentenced to the mines.” “These men have become dangerous to the Republic. Pause, ere you press your request.” “But this may reclaim him, and I owe a debt of gratitude to his mother, which I can never sufficiently repay.” “Enough, senor! I am convinced you will request nothing that is wrong. He shall be pardoned; his name?” “Richard Martin.” The President wrote an order for the release of the prisoner. Henry enclosed it in a letter to Richard at the public prison. He besought him, as he valued his life and liberty—by the memory of his mother, and his brother—by everything he held dear, to renounce his lawless course. And he requested him to visit him and inform him of his distant friends. Then despatching the pardon by a trusty messenger, he awaited the appearance of Richard. But hours passed on—a day—a week; and Henry heard no more of the pirate, but the report of the keeper of the prison, that he had been liberated. Richard was alone, in his cell, when the jailor came with his pardon, and delivered to him the letter of his injured friend. Richard read it; and a feeling of shame struck to his heart, as he reviewed the wrongs he had heaped upon the orphan's head. “I cannot meet him—I dare not,” cried he, and crumbling the paper in his hand, he rushed from the prison. It was night. The windows of the city were illuminated in honor of the arrival of Bolivar. Music sounded from the balconies; gay throngs, beneath an October moon, promenaded the grand square. Richard wandered on—alone; he saw no friend in the merry crowds; no warm hand grasped his own, and his companion was his knawing and evil conscience—his consoler, the thought of an ill-spent life. But the night wore away, and the morning broke; yet the freed prisoner, the escaped convict, found no shelter. And the broad sun rose up in the heavens—the drum of the troops on parade rang in his ears—the trumpet that called them to the general's quarters. Another sight, too, met the pirate captain's eyes; the men who had fought and bled with him on the high seas—the men whom he had led to crime and ruin—he beheld them marched, in manacles, by their guards, to their dismal home for life—the mines of Bogota. He fled from the sight. But the pangs of hunger assailed him; hunger, the gnawing demon that brings the proud spirit down, to earth. He was a stranger—where? Again the night came on, and Martin grew desperate. “Bread!” he cried, to a man that passed him, “give me bread.” “Away, beggar!” “Hell seize you,” exclaimed Martin, and sprung upon the speaker. But his frame, weakened by confinement and abstinence, was little able to cope with the man whom he attacked. Quick as thought, he was dashed to the ground, and the stranger's weapon was at his throat. “Spare me! I am starving!” shrieked Martin. “Ha! a bold beggar. Up with you.” Richard staggered to his feet. “Follow me,” said the stranger, and he led him to an obscure tavern, in one of the narrow streets of the lower town of Bogota. “Ho, wine and meat,” said the stranger to the host; “be speedy.” Richard Martin ate as if he never expected to get another meal; and the stranger watched him with a quiet smile, contenting himself with a draught of the wine. “Well, senor,” said Martin, as he finished his repast, and pushed away his plate, “what do you want me to do?” “Do?” echoed the stranger. “Yes; a man don't feed a starving beggar for nothing, especially when the beggar has just attempted to throttle him.” “Ah, I see you are the man I want. Well, do you want employment?” “What is it, and what's the pay?” “The pay shall be princely. To a man of your mettle, the job is slight. Listen,” and he bent his head to the ear of Martin, “Bolivar's death!” Martin started back. “How?” “The death of the tyrant. He who achieves it will merit the gratitude of all true republicans. Say, shall it be done?” “In what manner is he to fall, senor?” asked Richard. “Shoot him when he reviews the troops. There are a hundred windows on the Plaza, behind which you might lie concealed.” “But if I am taken? No, no, senor: some safer mode than that!” “What say you to striking the tyrant in his own palace?” “Amid his guards?” “Ay; do you fear? The palace can be entered—” “But I am told that Bolivar invariably sleeps with an officer of the guards in his ante-room.” “The officer sleeps with him, senor. We have more to fear from Bolivar's wakefulness, than that of his servants. But the plan is feasible. You shall enter the palace; ay, the president's chamber. One blow will change the destinies of the Republic; and you shall be nobly rewarded.” “And if I do not succeed?” “You must. But you shall be safe. This purse I give you as an earnest; it shall be tripled when the deed is done; speak.” “And who are you, senor, that are empowered—” The stranger bent down and whispered a name in the ear of Richard; a name that was high in the roll of the Republic's bravest. Martin sprang to his feet. “I will do it; when?” “The sooner the better; to-morrow night.” “To-morrow night.” “Remain, then, here,” said the stranger. “I will visit you to-morrow, and you shall know more. Farewell.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XXII. THE CONSPIRATORS. Wan treachery, With his thirsty dagger drawn. —Croly. That night was a fearful one for Richard Martin. Sleep came not to his glazed eyes, nor rest to his troubled conscience. The distant strokes of the cathedral clock struck to his heart like a death summons. He grasped the bowl, and poured out the red wine, until his hand shook, and his brain danced madly. Morning came apace, and at last sleep stole over the frame of the pirate-captain. Sleep, the soother, the invigorator, came upon him. But in the visions of his sleep came conscience, and the dark form of the night-mare fear perched on his heart, and gnawed his rest away. He tossed restlessly, he breathed hard, and strove in his dreams to wrestle with it. Then came a short, calm dream—a dream of childhood; when he played with his brother, and the orphans. The form of his mother bent over him with a placid smile, and the light laugh of Fanny Fowler rang in his ears. And Henry came, and the scene of his first detection, and the form of the friend he had betrayed, in a distant land. Richard Martin lived over again his wretched life. Then, in his slumber he beheld the stranger of the preceding night, beckoning him with a purse of gold, and his mother was weeping over him, and praying him to return. He awoke, and the stranger was indeed beside him. “You have slept well, 't is high noon. Are you ready to accompany me?” Richard gazed around with a wildered glance; “whither?” “We will instruct you.” “I cannot go.” “Ha! fear you?” “No, but—but—Spaniard, I am deep in blood; another drop will drown me.” “In gold, senor, then. Come, come; if you must stay, the soldiers of Bolivar shall be your companions.” “Do you threaten me? I know you, senor, and may denounce you.” “Ha, ha! where are your witnesses? no, no, you must come, amigo.” The stranger turned away, and—Richard followed him. In one of the chambers of a building whose windows overlooked the Presidential palace, were gathered a dozen individuals, whose military garb bespoke them officers of the Republic. On a table before them lay papers and charts, plans of battles, and marches, and over the door hung the flag of Venezuela. “Think you he will be satisfied with the presidency? Behold this,” and the speaker, a slight, yet muscular man, with a dark, bronzed face, and an eye like an eagle's, held up a chart; “this is his plan for the invasion of Peru, and the consolidation of a Spanish Vice-royalty; look ye, senors.” Dark frowns and muttered oaths came from the group, as they silently passed around the document. “And how shall it be stayed?” was the question of one who sat at the right of the first speaker. “Ay, how?” was the question that was echoed from one to the other The door flew open, and a tall form, enveloped in a mantle, entered. A whisper ran around the room, “'t is the major general.” “How, but by the death of the tyrant? the hour and the instrument are at hand.” “What mean you, general?” “That the tyrant, by your leave, shall die to-night.” A silence fell upon the listeners. Each man was struck dumb by the boldness of the proposition. “Well,” cried he whom they called general, “what say you? shall it be done?” “How?—by what means?” asked the first of the speakers. “Ask ye that? Speak! who will volunteer in his country's cause. Who will strike the tyrant?” There was no answer then, for the boldest would not have dared to attack the life of one girt by the shield of the people. “Do ye fear? Well, I will myself.” “Nay, nay, it were too perilons,” cried an officer, who had fought foremost in the battle, by the side of Bolivar. The major general strode to the door; “Senor Americanos.” Richard Martin entered. “Here is the instrument, one who hates tyrants, and will serve the republic. Speak, senor, are you ready?” “I am.” “Remain, then, here. Friends, we will take counsel.” And, followed by the other conspirators, he entered an inner apartment. Richard's ears caught the sound of loud and angry discussion. He heard the name of Bolivar more than once repeated, and with it the word `tyrant.' At last, the door opened, and he was called. And what a sight was before him! Kneeling around the apartment, were the conspirators, each with his crosier-hilted sword erect before him, and a white-stoled priest, with a wafer in his hand, administered the rite of Christianity. As he entered, they arose, and the cross was placed before him. “Swear, by the emblem of salvation, to be true. Kneel and swear—swear to strike deep to the heart of the tyrant!” And as the oath of the conspirator to do a deed of murder came from his white lips, the solemn `Amen' of the priest mingled with it; and the brows of the soldiers bent upon their cross-hilts. And thus shall the bigot and the murderer call upon religion to bless his crime, and it is sanctified unto him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XXIII. THE MURDER. Thomas. I did not see its form, Naught but the horrid face. Bernard. It is the murderer. Monk. What way went it. —Baillie. Bolivar slept. The victor, the liberator slept, but not in calmness. Was it the whisperings of mighty ambition that caused the tossing and the restlessness, the deep sigh, and the smothered groan? He awoke suddenly, and sprung from his couch. “Mina!” The major, whose watch in the ante-room it was that night, entered. “Your excellency.” “I am troubled, I know not why. Remain with me, Mina, I would not be alone. I am not superstitious, major,” said he with a smile, “but there is a heaviness upon me that I cannot account for.” Mina bowed, and seated himself. “Nay, major,” said Bolivar, “throw yourself beside me on the couch; companionship may drive off these vague forebodings.” And there they rested; the two careworn soldiers. The room was lit by a high candelabra, and every object was distinctly discernable. Bolivar's eyes wandered restlessly around the apartment. Suddenly a shadow flitted by the open casement upon the balcony. Bolivar strained his glance; again it passed, and the President sprang to his feet. “My general!” said Mina. “I will return---remain,” and Bolivar advanced to the casement. All was still. No sound save the distant tread of the sentinel, as he paced his rounds before the Palace. In the ante-room still slumbered two officers of the Presidential guard. Bolivar glanced at them, and through the open casement upon the sleeping city.— “This is childishness!” he murmured to himself, “I will sleep,” and he turned towards the couch. Mina's eyes had followed the movements of the President. As Bolivar left the casement, the major's watchful eyes caught a glimpse of a dark figure on the balcony. It entered, and crept noiselessly behind the general . Quick as lightning the pistol of the major was discharged at the intruder, and springing from the bed, Mina threw himself before his general. Bolivar turned, startled at the report and flash---turned, but to behold his brave officer staggering to the floor. “Treason!” cried he, and the guards in the ante-chamber rushed in. A muffled figure rushed by them, and sprang over the balcony. Two shots from the pistols rang simultaneously in the general's ears. The next instant, the room was filled by the roused soldiers. Bolivar bent over Mina---a dagger stuck in his side. “My general,” cried Mina, as his eyes opened on the President, “it is well.” The hand which Bolivar had grasped closed upon his own, and Mina fell back. He had died for his country's deliverer, a death well fitting the soldier and the patriot. “Pursue the assassin!” cried the general, as he sprang to his feet. It needed no more. Fowler, who had entered, cast but one look at his dead friend, and rushed from the apartment, followed by the excited guards. Torches flashed through the gardens, and over the Plaza. “Ha! blood!” cried a soldier, stooping with his torch to examine some dark stains upon a broad stone of the court-yard. “We will track the murderer.” And they followed the course of the blood drops, across the Plaza, and through the imperial street. Drop by drop, it led them on, Fowler at their head. Suddenly the trail stopped; they had reached the river side. Fowler plunged in, beat back the wave, and gained the opposite bank. The form of a man lay prostrate upon the brink and the young captain sprang towards it. The figure rose and staggering forward, raised his sword. The torch which Fowler bore, gleamed in the man's face---it was the face of Richard Martin. Ay, HE was the murderer. The second time had his dagger drank the blood of the Peruvian captain; and this was the death-draught. “Richard---again?” cried the horror-stricken Fowler. “I'm gone—Harry---shot---yes!” muttered Dick, as he fell at the feet of Fowler. Henry bent over him. The soldiers who had followed him, now gained the bank, and surrounded the dying murderer. Curses loud and deep rang in his ears. “Let him confess,” said Fowler to them, in Spanish. “Ay, confess—confess, I will do that,” cried Richard. “Ha, ha! I'm dying; here, Harry—Harry Fowler; I'm a villain. Here, this is yours, take it,” and he tore open his breast, and grasped a little packet. “Mercy! Oh, God—water, water!” A soldier bent forward, and presented his sword hilt; “the cross,” he said. “Away—damnation, ha, ha!” “Richard—Richard—” “Ah, Harry, are you there? Look here! Fowler, I've wronged you—will you—will you—” “I forgive you Martin. May HE forgive you!” said Fowler raising his eyes to heaven. “Ha, ha, ha!” and the soul of the guilty man fled—whither? “He's gone,” said the young captain, as he placed the packet in his bosom, “bear him to the Palace.” A tall form, muffled in a mantle, started from behind one of the trees, that edged the river, as the soldiers bore the murderer back. “He cannot implicate me,” he muttered to himself, “he is dead with Bolivar.” Mounting a horse, he gallopped from the spot. “What is that?” asked one of the soldiers as the clatter of the horse's hoofs struck their ears, as they crossed the narrow bridge that spanned the river. “The wind, comrade,” was the answer. They knew not that the greater villain had escaped, for the tool lay dead before them. “And you must return,” said Bolivar to Captain Fowler. “I would do so, your excellency. I would see my friends, and assert my innocence. Your excellency has heard my story.” “I have; yet I would have you remain. Bethink yourself; I am your friend; your way is open here. But, if you must, return to your country. But let this,” and he took from his finger a costly gem, “let this ring remind you of Bolivar.” Henry sank upon his knee, and grasped the general's hand. “Farewell,” said the President; “when next you visit South America, I may be a private man. But I will still be your friend, and your country's.” “May heaven preserve your excellency.” “Heaven has done so, thus far,” said Bolivar, “from the dagger and the cannon ball. I hold the sword of the Republic, under heaven, for her good. The foes of her liberty may hate and persecute me. The field of battle shall attest the valor of our soldiers and the triumph of our liberty; the same fortunate field shall see me throw down the palm of my command. Adieu, scnor, return to your country, and remember Bolivar.” Farewell to the sunny Southern shores!— Farewell to the hard strife, to the glorious victory! Henry Fowler turned from the palace of Bolivar with a sigh and a smile— a sigh for the friends he should leave behind, and for the fate of the gallant Mina; but the smile was the shadow of Hope, as she came from his boyhood's home. His soul had roved, aimless, amid the wild scenes of his past year's life, but she had now found an object. Home!—how the young wanderer's heart leaped at the thought, for the vision of a bright future came with it. He longed for the day when he should tread again his native shores, with the proofs of his wrong and his innocence. The dying Richard's gift was the key of the orphan's future. “Shure, but ye won't lave us, captain.” “I must return, my dear O'Callagan; I have fond friends in my own country, and my heart is with them. But will you not accompany me, my brave friend, and—” “Throth and it's meself that has frinds,” said the warm-hearted Irishman, as he dashed a tear from his eye; “but, God hilp them, they dwell in the stranger's land.” “And have you none in your own country, major?” “Not while the yoke of the Sassenach is upon her. No, me young frind, me breath is freedom, and the curse of the stranger has poisoned the air of the green Isle.” “Come, then, with me, major, to my own free land,” said Henry. “Nay, me lot is cast here, till the battles of freedom are inded, or her light ahall baam on the hills of swate Erin. Good bye, me young soldier, and when you see an Irishman frindliss and in ixile, befrind him for me sake. God bliss ye. Remimber O'Callagan.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XXIV. THE RETURN.—CONCLUSION. The Wanderer was returned! I saw him stand Before an altar, with a blushing bride. —Byron. It was evening in the merry month of May. A glad company were gathered in the mansion of Mr. Abbot, in Collonade Row. It was the bridal night of William. And who did he wed? Who, but the lovely orphan who had saved his life, was the bride of the merchant's son. The heart of Fanny was joyous, yet there was a sadness mingled with its joyousness. Her smile was sweet, yet there was melancholy in it, for she thought of her absent brother. Lucia, too, thought of him. But in that thought was there nought but the thrill of friendship for an absent one? Ah, ask the youthful and glowing heart of the gentle maiden if she did not even to herself confess a stronger, deeper, warmer feeling—a feeling to which their association in the morning of their days had given birth, but which had been nursed to an ardent intensity because its object had not been near to share it—the first breathing of love! The guests were gay—the dance went round. The wine, for they drank wine then, was poured, in sparkling libations, to the health of the happy pair. “One thing alone is wanting,” said Mr. Abbot; “were your brother here, my sweet girl, our joy were all complete.” The door opened, and the servant ushered in a guest. All turned as a tall and commanding figure entered the apartment, and advanced towards the bride. He was muffled in a mantle, that hid his face, but he no ticed not the surprise of the company. He took the hand of the bride. “What means this, sir?” asked William, advancing. The stranger's cloak fell off. One moment, Fanny gazed astonished at a form arrayed in the rich uniform of the Bolivian Republic. The next, she was in the arms of her long-lost brother. Henry strained her to his heart, and turned to meet the bashful greeting of the wondering Lucia. She was no longer the playmate—the laughing girl, but a gentle and loving woman. “God be thanked!” said Mr. Abbot; “my wronged boy is returned.” “Welcome, Harry, my old friend, and brother.” Henry gave into the hands of Mr. Abbot a small packet. It was that given him by the dying Richard—it was that given to the wretched murderer by his dying mother. The merchant opened it, and his face grew pale, and his hands trembled. “My sister's letters!” cried he. “And we are thy sister's children,” said Henry, “the children of Mary Abbot.” The tears gushed from the good merchant's eyes. “Then are you my children, bless ye, bless ye.” “So we are cousins,” said Lucia, throwing herself in the arms of the happy Fanny. What a long time it would take to tell the joy of the reunited ones—to tell how Mr. Abbot's sister Mary had eloped with a poor man, and for love had lived and died in obscurity—how she had committed to Mrs. Martin the history of her life—how Richard had concealed it from Henry; and how his remorse had at last restored it to the orphan's hands. And how long it would take to describe the love of William and Fanny, too. So, we will leave it to those who love, to fancy it. Thus far in the life-path of youth, have we travelled. Shall we follow? No! for youth is the fresh floweret of the morning, and the high sun of fortune, as well as the storm-wind of adversity, must wither it. We have followed the good and the bad, and we have traced their fate. The long-lost has come once more to his childhood's home. There let him rest. The guilty one sleeps in a foreign land, in a murderer's grave. May he rest also, for of the grave we know not. But what has the old man Time done with the others. The erring but loving Mary we have lost sight of. The repentant Fred. we left in a prison. The coquette Kate, and the wild Ned Rifton—we must trace them, for they, too, were the persons of the drama. There was a beautiful little cottage, in a lovely village in Massachusetts; and the vines clambered over the door, and flowers bloomed in the garden before it. Fields with the shining tops of the grain glittering in the summer sunset, were around it. And at the open door, sat a farmer with a young and beautiful wife, and a little cherub of an infant sported before them. “And have you not heard of Henry Fowler's marri age with the beautiful daughter Mr. Abbot.” “Yes, Frederick, Mrs. Rifton told me in her letter, and of the dreadful fate of Richard Martin.” “Yes, Mary; and such might have been my fate, but for you,” and the husband looked fondly on his young wife. “But when is Rifton coming to visit us?” “Next month. And Kate, too.” “What a happy couple are they, Mary— Ned and Kate.” “And are not we, Frederick?” “Yes, Mary; for I am honest now.” Reader! This has not been a “seduction tale.” You have not been dragged through the chambers of a brothel, nor amid the scenes of low vice. But the “life of the gay spirits” has been lightly touched; and the swift and sudden descent of the precipice of crime has been faintly pictured. What has been said is truth, in the main, and the moral is the moral of life.</field>
