      <field name="fulltext">BOOK I. CHAPTER I. WE have seen that a sort of constitution had been formed; or rather government constituted; for the Captain had been chosen Governor, and the blind lawyer appointed chief justice. A sense of self-preservation had led to this. For it had been found, that in a situation of things approaching to a state of nature, the weak were a prey to the strong, and oftentimes, among the strong, there was much wrong done, not being sufficiently afraid of each other, when the corporal powers were nearly equal; and, until it had been ascertained which had the mastery, much maiming had prevailed.— It had been customary for individuals to league together, to defend themselves; and there was much gouging and biting on both sides, when a contest of the few had arisen. Settlement against settlement was pitted; and district against district, oftentimes with much battery, and blood-shed. Calling out for help was usual amongst the combatants, and it was accounted dishonourable not to interfere, by those not engaged. An honest man walking home one evening, and, whether from intemperance or sleep, nodding as he walked, which being mistaken by a ram for a menace, he was butted, as the phrase is, and overthrown, calling out, “is there none of the down county boys here?” This may serve to give an image of the state of society at this period. It will serve still more to illustrate this, when I relate the following anecdote. A lawyer, or at least one who called himself such, of small stature, and delicate structure of body, being applied to by a client, who having no money, but being of a strong body, offered to do all his fighting for him; that is, for the pettifogger. That will not do, said the wary advocate; for you may not be at hand always to protect me, from an insult, much less from assault; but if you will permit me on some occasion to overpower and beat yourself that is, to seem to do it, as your prowess is incontestible, it will secure me ever after; for no one will molest me. It was agreed; and a sham battle being fought, the advocate, as was agreed upon, got the better. But the whole coming out in due time, when the laws began to be established, the bruiser, as he had been called, prosecuted the advocate; who pleaded an assault demesne, and relying an the maxim, volenti non fit injuria, he was acquitted; and on the civil action, no damages were found against him. It was on this principle, and, in this state of things, that the Captain had been elected Governor. For, coming to the settlement attended by his posse, Will Watlin, Tom the Tinker, Harum Scarum, and O`Fin the Irishman, a damp was struck upon the hearts of the insurgents in different places, which the people seeing, recurred to this new power for safety. Will Watlin having pulled up a grub, and entering the town, called it a switch, as I have seen represented on the stage in some dramatic composition; the people thinking that if that was a switch, what would his baton, or cudgel be? O`Fin the Irishman had, in fact, entered with a log on his shoulder, which he called his shilelah, and threatened death and destruction to all that came his way. Harum Scarum had a branch of an oak tree, which he trailed after him; and Tom the Tinker approached with a club, which he called his hammer. It was much larger than the club of Herculus is painted, and though he had not the strength to wield it with equal ease, yet, poised upon his right shoulder, it had the appearance of a weapon that would do much execution. Teague, the bog-trotter, though with great difficulty, drew after him a piece of a pine log, which he said he had been tired wielding, and knocking down people with. The Captain had a staff, not as large as a weaver's beam, but far surpassing the size of a common walking stick. From these appearances, there had been no resistance made; and in due time the country thought it advisable to put themselves under the protection of persons whose object it seemed to be to keep the peace, and maintain the laws. The Captain had been chosen Governor. But in writing the chapter of the last book of this work, I had run over a great space without entering into the detail, or minutiæ of events. For that, and no other reason, it may appear to want verisimilitude of incidents to support the probability of the narrative. “Premiere de Rois etoit un soldat hereux,” Says Voltaire: and though it may be disputed whether knowledge is power, yet no one can deny, but that wattles and hearts of oak have a great tendency to procure submission. But the Captain himself was uneasy under this usurped authority; and the people began to talk of his resembling Bonaparte. There were those who threw out hints that he had an understanding with that emperor.— It was much agitated in beer-houses, whether he was not under French influence. He denied it, and stood to it, that he had no correspondence with the tyrant.— Is it possible, said he, that I could have much attachment to Bonaparte, who has no attachment to me? For I am well persuaded that he has never heard of me; nor can he possibly regard what government, or kind of government, I have over a few ragamuffins assembled, or rather scattered, in a distant quarter of the globe. It is true, I did happen, coming along, to speak a few words of French, at least they told me it was French, which I had got from a parlez-vous, a carrier, that spoke a certain lingo to his horses; because being used to his vocabulary, they understood no other language; but it was in the most perfect simplicity of mind; and I am not sure that it was French that I did speak; or rather that he spoke; for what I said was in imitation of certain sounds, rather than words of his, as I could catch them from the rapidity of his pronunciation. But why need there be a noise made about it. I am ready to lay down my oak stick, which has been the badge of my government, whenever any one of you chuses.— Let it be laid down, and with that he flung it across a potatoe patch, as far as he could throw it. Now, there it is, said he, and you are a free people. But what are you the better for that? Was it not to keep you from having broken heads that I took up the government.— You talk of Bonaparte usurping the government. What government did he usurp? Had not the people of France found out that there was no government, and could be none short of a despotism? The constitution of 1791, had given way. That of 1793, had gone to the tomb of the Capulets. Was there not one of 1795? If so, It had also gone. The only two of the directory that had any talents, or integrity, Barthelemi, and Carnot, were deported to Cayenne. The better part of the council of 500, and of the council of ancients, I mean the best men of these bodies, were carted in iron cages to the sea shore, and sent off in frigates. Could there be said to be any freedom at this time? What was it that induced Abbe Sieyes, and other wise men who had been tired of making constitutions, to send for Bonaparte to Egypt to take the helm of the state vessel? For, pursuing the figure, when the vessel is at the mercy of the waves, tost and ready to run upon the breakers, is it usurpation to take the helm, and steer her in safety? Comparing small things with great, myself to Bonaparte, did I usurp any authority, when you yourselves called upon me, being at loggerheads, to take the government. But as I have more concern for you, than you have for yourselves, I will retain it a little, with a view to preserve order and regularity among you until you get a constitution, if by that means you can secure your liberty. This speech being ended, it was agreed to consider of a constitution. It was debated in the beer-houses, whether a despotism was not best; or the continuance of the present constitution. But it was carried nemine contradicente, that something new should be adopted. It was agitated how a republican government should begin. Doubtless, it was answered, by a convention of the people. It was asked, how should that convention be brought about? It was answered, in the same mode and by the same means, as what is called a camp-meeting: This is a gathering of fanatics, of which we have seen examples, in almost all parts of the United States. But would there not be danger of the same tumblings, and jumpings, and contortions of body, and agitations of mind, as at those congregations No; because the female part of the society would be excluded. These are not only convulsionists, but the cause of convulsions becoming general among the multitude, by sympathy of feeling, and extasy of vision. Keep these away, and the meeting might be kept sober, unless indeed spirituous liquor was introduced.— And when serious business was on the carpet, this might be excluded, allowing a few days of intemperance, in the manner of the ancient Germans, before the council had begun. It was agreed that a general warning should be given to meet under bushes, and tree-tops by such a day, not in conclave, or divan, but in a general convention of the people, to deliberate on the frame of a constitution.— But were they all to convene, every male, of whatever age, embracing infantia, which ends at the age of seven years; Pueritia, which terminates at 14; Adolescentia, which lasts until that of twenty-one years; or juventus which may be considered as ending at the age of thirty-five; or the virilis ætas, which is complete at twenty-eight, and lasts the whole life of man. Senium, or old age, commences at fifty-seven. Was this age to be excluded by reason of imbecility from the deliberations of perfect men? Another question arose; was every man that wore a head, tag, rag, and bob-tail, to assemble, and have a vote? In contemplation of law, at the formation of our republic, it must be so. And though, in fact, it never was the case, yet the principle stands immovable, and all must be supposed to have a voice. “We the people,” admits of no exclusion. But are people to be admitted that have no understanding? Who can undertake to say of another that he wants sense? Intelligence cannot be weighed by the pound or ounce, or measured by the ell or the perch Who is to make the selection from the mass? It was agreed, therefore, that all who chose to meet, should convene. Advertisements to this effect were put in the gazette, having a journal or public paper in town; and cards and handbills were affixed upon trees, and barn doors, and chalked upon fence rails, and those who could not write proclaimed with the voice, the general assembling of the people. The day came, and the hills were covered.— Those upon the low grounds shouted up to their superiors on the hills; and the hills vociferated to those below But great confusion ensued, by interruption and discussion. Some order became necessary, and the reducing the multitude to a smaller compass; but this could not be done, until a part wearied out, and wanting food, departed to their homes. There were but about a score of persons remaining when the next day appeared. Having taken some refreshment of food, these set about the business. But half asleep, they were incompetent, and had to take a nap before they could renew the task which they had undertaken. It was now debated, whether these present could be considered as representing those that were absent. This was plain; for all had had an opportunity, and might have attended if they would. The question was now agitated, should they have a constitution? Upon this there was a diversity of voices.— Said an honest fellow, what have we to do with a constitution? Why form one? Will we stick to a constitution when we have made it? A constitution is like a nose of wax; it is twisted by the party that is predominant. It might not however be unadvisable to have some outline of a constitution; some groove within which to move, some shape and form of the machine of government. If the people cannot all convene; or if they do convene, cannot act without confusion, as the late experiment had abundantly evinced, it would be necessary to have some means of reducing them to a narrower compass. Let there be primary assemblies, meetings of the people in particular districts, and let these elect and send representatives to a secondary assembly. Let these secondary assemblies select from amongst themselves, and depute to an ultimate body, who shall from time to time meet and frame the laws. Judicial officers must exist distinct from the legislature; executive distinct from both.— Who shall appoint these officers, and in what manner it shall be done, must require some designation, or rule laid down. The nature of the government itself must be determined on; at least some name must be given it, whether it shall be called a republican government, or an aristocracy, or monarchy. Vol. IV. B CHAPTER II. THERE is in the moral world, what may be called an influenza, as well as in the natural. I leave it to physicians to treat particularly of the influenza in the natural world; though disquisitions as to the origin, and history of an epidemic is more within the province of the natural philosopher than of the physician; this last having to do, more with the treatment, and cure of diseases, than with the history; though it must greatly conduce to a knowledge of the remedy of a disorder, to know its origin, and cause, and progress. Hence it is, that no man, whose mind, from nature, or from education, or both, has not been led to investigate causes, and effects, in the natural world, can be a great physician. In laying this down, I reason in my own mind from analogy. For though my knowledge of this subject is not extensive, I mean of the subordinate necessity of general information to particular science, in the case of a physician; yet I can have some conception of it, from what I do know, and can more confidently assert in the case of a jurisconsult, and politician. By politician I do not mean a diplomatist, having a knowledge of affairs of state, or that has been employed in correspondence and communications with foreign ministers; or in the relations and conventions of states with each other. It is a higher science, that I have in view, the arrangement of a form of government for a people; the making salutary laws. Here it is that I find myself on a commanding eminence; when in imagination, I can reach it, surrounded with the great of the world. To them is owing all that distinguishes man from man; whether they have moulded systems that are the offspring of accident in their beginnings, or, that, on original ground they have built fabricks; I will acknowledge that almost all systems of liberty, have begun like almost all other things, that are great, from nothing; and have been gradually moulded to permanence, and durability. And while the unceasing activity of the passions have led to such changes, as have established, or preserved liberty, the same cause has invariably led to the dissolution of free governments. It therefore becomes a matter of the nicest observation, and most comprehensive judgment, to know where to rest. Nevertheless in the most settled state of things, and most happy establishment, if some one like Ehud, blows a trumpet for a change, he will have followers. It may be impossible to trace the very point in the community at which a wild idea took its rise, or what passion in the individual gave it birth, but its progress, like the influenza, may be traced; and its gradual march from north to south, or from east to west, and its deleterious effects. It is immaterial whether it is the common law that is to be abolished, or the right of suffrage extended to beasts. No matter what the innovation, it will have partizans. What we have depicted therefore ought not to be set down as incredible. I would not wonder if it should come to be seriously agitated some years hence, unless this burlesque prevents it. For you might as well express surprise at a man under an influenza having a fever, as at the multitude under a political impression, being thrown into delirium, and phrenzy. In a case of such madness, direct reasoning will be of no avail; but the turning the course of the thought aside by the substitution of some other; not perhaps questioning the practicability, much less the expediency of the proposition, in vogue, but suggesting a more eligible mode of execution. If divisions can be sown amongst the innovators as to the ways and means, they may be diverted from the principal object. Thus in the case of bestial suffrage, admit that quadrupeds have a right to human society, yet the question may be made, whether a gradual, or an immediate emancipation may be advisable. After this, another ground of discrepancy may be laid, suggesting with what species of the brutal kingdom it may be proper to commence the reform. Some who speak first, will say an elephant, and then a Rhinoceros; when all voices are heard, there may be found as many opinions as there are voices. Quot hominum, tot capitum. By good management it may be brought to a wrangle whether votes shall not be in proportion to bulk, strength, or swiftness. To oppose the giving a vote at all will be unwise, but the giving it in a different way and manner from that proposed, or if some strong and monstrous inconvenience can be pointed out, immediately about to fall upon themselves, such as was hit upon, on this occasion, of their changing places, and turning beasts, and being yoked to carts; knocked on the head; or taken in traps, it may succeed. For this is not barely touching the pocket, but affecting the person. It is affecting it sensibly; for the tugging at a trace up a hill presents an idea that is intelligible, and immediately repulsive. Much more the being shot at with a rifle, and the hide taken off as you would a bear-skin. No man will run a risk of a change of affairs, if a bare possibility of such a reverse as this, can be brought into view. I am well aware that there are readers; that is, there will be readers, if they do read, and come to the sense of these last sentences, who will say, what is this, but nonsense? But to such I beg leave to put this question, and let them answer me after much thought and due deliberation, whether it is not what every one cannot do; to talk nonsense eloquently. I know of no author in which this is more exemplified, than a book much praised, but in which I have never been able to discover a single ray of sense; and that is Bolinbroke's idea of a patriot king. And as a parallel to this, I give another as it appeared to me at the time I cast my eye upon it, which was in early life; and which book is always spoken of as a model of stile; viz. Shaftsbury's Characteristics But the truth is, I could not ascertain the point of his observations. I take the chapter that I have just written to be somewhat of the same cast. But as —“Learned Commentators view In Homer more than Homer knew,” the critics may draw something out of it. But if they should not be able to extract a sentiment, let them confine their observation, to the stile, which, at our entrance on the task of writing this book, we declared to be our primary object. I will acknowledge at the same time, entre nous, that stile is what I never could exactly hit, to my own satisfaction. And in the English language, that of Hume, Swift, and Fielding, is the only stile that I have coveted to possess. For I take it they are precisely the same, according to the subjects of their writing But the easy, the natural, and the graceful, is of all stiles, whether of manners or of speaking, the most difficult to attain. CHAPTER III. IT being understood that a constitution by ten, or even twenty men, would be a thing of bad fame, the decemviri among the Romans having got a bad name, it was agreed that the small remnant there convened should proceed no farther than to call a convention of delegates, the time, places, and manner of chusing, which, was pointed out. “Tantæ molis erat romanam condere gentem.” It was necessary that information of this should be communicated. But as a journal, or gazette might not reach all; or if it did reach them, they might not be able to read; runners were dispatched, Tom, Dick, and Harry, to carry the intelligence. The Captain's posse comitatis Harum Scarum, O'Fin the Irishman, &amp;c. having hand-bills struck off, were ordered on their travels though bush, brake, and wood-land, to circulate advertisements. Due notice having been now given, and on the day, a chosen few having been selected from the primary meetings, which by the bye, were not always very numerous; for in some places, the father chose the son, and in other places, the son the father; these, I say, being met, proceeded to debate on the principles of the great magna charta of a constitution. And as at Runnymede, it was literally under an oak, or rather a grove of oaks, that they were convened, a matter of debate was whether every thing that wore a head should have a vote in chusing legislators. It was restrained to the male kind; of course females were excluded. But should boys come in? That was the question. Not unless full grown boys. But at what age does the body come to its growth? Not until the age of 28, says Doctor Jameson, a physician of Cheltenham, in his treatise on the body, does it come to its full growth. It spreads until that time. But impatience to have the rights of men prevailed with some delegates, and they were of opinion to dock off seven years, and to fix the age of virility at 21; for that was the age of the common law, in most of the other states. B 2 But should the suffrage be universal, or with a qualification of property? not real property; that was out of the question: for every check ought to be put upon the engrossing the soil, as the population of the country depended upon restricting to a small share. Camillus had but four acres, said the Latin schoolmaster, and well cultivated, that might suffice any one. At all events it was not good policy to hold out any encouragement to engross land. But it was agreed that every man should have a vote in proportion to his stock. For this was originally the meaning of the word chattels. We shall hear more of this anon; for it led to an opinion in the sequel, that beasts themselves should vote. —Cujum pecus? an millibœi? Said the Latin scoolmaster. But except as to the qualifications of electors, it was determined there should be no constitution; but that, bound by no girdle when the representatives convened, they should legislate at free scope without restraint, from preconceived rules, and set forms shackling the understanding; but that it should be a pure democracy; a real republic. All hands aloft was now the word, to man the state ship. O' navis qua tibi creditam— Said the Latin schoolmaster. The Captain was re-elected Governor; The blind Lawyer appointed Chief Justice; O'Fin the Irishman Sheriff; Teague O'Regan Secretary of State; and Tom the Tinker Cryer of the Courts. All things were going on smoothly, and there bade fair to be much harmony in the commonwealth. CHAPTER IV. THE principle of universal suffrage was much agitated at this time: whether every poll, as the word imports should poll, or have a vote; or that property should also vote. If property alone, the question would arise, whether soil only; or also goods and chattles. If soil only, to what quantity or quality, shall the suffrage be attached? An hundred acres of soil of a bad quality, may not have the intrinsic worth of one of good. How should an inspector, or judge of an election, determine on the quality, unless the owner brings a sample with him, as the man who had his house to sell, brought a brick. This would be an inconvenience; and would render it impracticable to escape frauds. For a man might dig a sample from his neighbours, and pass it for his own. And as to quantity, the occupier of the greater quantity, is the most worthless citizen; at least the one who occupies more than he cultivates; because he neither eats the hay, nor lets another eat it. It is preposterous that soil should vote; a dumb field, a dead tree with a crows nest upon it; an hazle bush; a morass, or a barren mountain; or even a hill with a tuft of oaks upon it. These are all inanimate substances; how can they vote? For goods and chattles something might be said; a live beast particularly; as the animal could speak, not with a viva voce vote, like a man; more humano, like a human creature. But with some guttural sound from the throat, or fauces, which might be called its own; and not like the tree with a turkey buzzard on it; and which is not its own voice. I mean that of the tree, said the speaker, who was running on in this manner; and yet it is advocated, that stocks and stones that go with the soil shall have a vote. There might be some reason in improvements voting; a brick house or a dutch barn; but none at all in the mere brutum tellus of an estate. This led the way to an hypothesis, that property in moveables should alone entitle; and this, after some debate, began to be narrowed down to property in living animals; especially to useful quadrupeds, and those of full growth, and who had come to years, I will not say of discretion, but of maturity. From the light thrown upon the subject, the right of suffrage to grown cattle had become so popular, that there was no resisting it; not that viva voce it was proposed or thought of that, inarticulating speaking creatures should speak out, or name their representatives, nor even that they should give in a ballot, but that they should be brought upon the ground to shew their faces, that there might be no imposition, the voters alleging that they had cattle when they had not. But it was not to every owner's beast that it was advisable to extend the right; but only to the more valuable animals; or such as were of a good breed; Virginia horses that are fit for the saddle or the turf. It may seem very strange; but actually the thing took; and at a polling some time after, it began to be carried into effect that beasts should be constituents, and have their representatives. It was not the principle, but to the individual beast that some exceptions took place; as for instance, an English bull was brought upon the hustings to give his vote. We will have no English bull said the inspectors. Not that a brute beast is not entitled to a vote; nor that a bull cannot vote, or be voted for; but this is an English bull. No English bull can vote. You might as well bring an Englishman himself, to the polls. It is in right of the bull-keeper, or rather bull-owner, that the bull claims the suffrage. If an Englishman himself, not naturalized, is excluded, how can his bull or his horse, or any other quadruped be admitted? It would be sufficient to set aside the election if his ticket was introduced. A bull indeed! The name of John Bull is appropriate to an Englishman. An Irish bull is quite another matter; John Bull shall have no vote here. In the mean time, a man on an iron-grey horse rode up to the window, which was open for receiving tickets, and unequivocally insisted on a vote for his horse. Vouchers stood by, who averred that he was foaled in the county, that, horse and colt, they had known him many years; that as to his paying taxes, they could not so well say, unless his labour on the farm could be considered as paying tax. In the mean time, the horse putting his nose in at the window, taking it for a rack, an inspector gave him a fillup on the snout, which resenting; the owner wheeling round, the horse wheeling under him, he rode over one or more of the bystanders who were in the way. Certain it is, the horse was a meritorious horse, having seen service in the campaign under General Wayne against the Indians in 1793. Nevertheless, they that had been rode over did not brook the affront, or put up with it unrevenged; for calling out horse, horse, to which some added the word stolen, as fame increases as it goes, it was echoed along the lines stolen horse; upon which the man was apprehended, and carried before a magistrate, who not having heard of the right of beasts to vote, thought this story improbable as he related what had passed at the window of the election house, and for want of proper bail he was committed. It may be material to mention that the horse's mane and tail were black to distinguish him from a grey horse that belonged to another person. I have known several that knew the horse; but who were not present on the occasion to which we refer, and so, will not undertake to vouch for the truth of it, not having charged their memory with it, or taken a note of it at the moment it occurred. Or it may be, they do not chuse to recollect it, or give information on the subject, thinking it prudent not to involve themselves on elective disputes, as there is no knowing, when parties run high, how far the bare vouching for a fact may involve one. Such is the result of strong passions when not under the controul of reason and reflection Weak persons are always the most positive, because they cannot afford the acknowledgment of an error It will not do to admit fallibility; for there is no knowing how far the inference may be drawn. Another man came up who brought a sheep to the polls; a merino ram, who, he said, was entitled to a vote, having resided in the country, since he had been brought in by Humphreys, representing him to be of the breed of the great Fezzen ram, though there were those who thought it might be what is called a yankey trick; not but, that all Americans may be capable of substituting a thing for what it is not; and all are called Yankees by the British; but New-England men are distinguished; and called Yankee Doodles. The ram is not entitled to a vote said the inspector, nor ought he to be permitted to put in a ticket, were he of the breed of the golden fleece guarded by the fiery dragons whom Jason overcame; and brought away the wool; no; not if he was the very ram that was caught in the thicket; or that Daniel saw in his vision coupled with the he goat. But he is a Spanish ram born under despotism, how can he be expected to give a republican vote; of papist origin, he may bring the inquisition with him; coming here to vote. Besides, this is a very real sheep, that is offered; and not one whom we call a sheep in a figurative sense of the word. Where we call men horses, or asses, we do not mean always that they are so, puris naturalibus, without overalls on, with the horn and the hoof about them, but shadowing forth the same thing under a veil of metaphor, as the case may be. But not on this ground altogether do I reject him; and because he has wool on his back; but, because he is of barbary origin. The Moors brought the breed into Spain. You may cast a sheep's eye at the window as long as you please, master ram; but not a vote shall you have as long as I am here. I do not know whether you are not a half breed, and no genuine merino. So away with him, as the song says, “To the ewe-boughts, Marian.” Another person coming up, brought a large ox, which he called Thomas Jefferson; not out of respect to the ox, but to the man, as having a good name and reputation. Make way, said the voters, for Thomas Jefferson. We will have no Thomas Jeffersons, said the inspector; he is out of his district. I assert the contrary, said the owner; he was calved in this settlement. He is called the mammoth ox, and I had thought of driving him to Washington; but that I knew, however he might be made a present to Jefferson, the congress would eat him, as they did the mammoth cheese; so that the president would scarcely get a slice of him. For there are parasites in all countries; and the worthless are chiefly those who dance attendance upon men in office; and how can it be avoided to invite them to partake of civilities? You will certainly allow a vote to Thomas Jefferson — No; not if he was the real Jefferson from Monticello, said the inspector. How can I tell but he may introduce the same politics? That is true, said another; break judges, abolish taxes, dismantle navies, build gunboats, lay embargoes, depress armies, pay tributes to barbary powers, issue proclamations, wear red breeches, receive ambassadors in pantaloons and slippers, collect prairie dogs, and horned frogs, dream of salt mountains, walk with Pedimetres, and be under French influence. We will have no Thomas Jefferson. You may drive off your ox. He shall have no vote here. No doubt the judges and inspectors, being men of sense, saw the absurdity of carrying the principle so far into practice, as to admit the representation of property, by this property being itself, and in its own individual existence, the constituent. But not thinking it safe, or practicable, to resist this temporary phrenzy, and misconception of things, by a direct resistance, it became necessary, by indirect means to avoid it. To lay it down in the face of the multitude that these new voters had not a right, would not have been endured; but parrying it by questioning the right in a particular case, gave no umbrage. It was saving the principle, though it denied the exercise. The man that had rode down the bystanders, and was taken up for a horse thief, was pardoned by the governor. This was done to get quit of the investigation; the governor thinking it for the credit of the country that there should be nothing said about the occasion, and manner of the felony; or the mistake under which the imputation had arisen. But, party spirit at this time had begun to run high; some insisting on the right of suffrage to their cattle; and others considering it a burlesque. You might have seen shilelahs in the air, and several bullocks were knocked down that were brought up to the polls. A lad was tumbled from his palfry as he was riding him to water, under an idea that he was bringing him to aid the adverse ticket. The lad was somewhat hurt by the fall, and the steed ran off, and could not be caught again until salt was shewn him, and oats in a hat, some one crying cope, cope. The ram that had been offered, seeing arrive the sheep, cried ba; and it was insisted that he had given his vote, which the candidate against whom it was taken down, resented; and hit the tup a stroke, that, in the sailor's phrase, brought him on his beam ends.— The blow, however, which was aimed at a pig in a poke, which a man was carrying home, and which was heard to squeal; struck the man himself: What, said the assailant, are you bringing here the swinish multitude to vote? Nevertheless, it was not so much the admitting quadrupeds, but unqualified cattle that became the subject of the controversy; intelligent persons arguing that it was a thing shameful in itself, and unjust. Because it was a fraud upon the whole community, that stragglers should be brought forward, which the individual concerned in the fraud reconciled to himself on the score of serving the party: That it required some refinement to be aware of the indelicacy of urging an improper vote. Was it reasonable to suppose that a horse creature could give an independent vote, that was in the power of his owner to be stinted of his oats, and rode faster or slower as he thought proper, on a journey? Was it reasonable to expect that the ox would think differently on political subjects from his master? Should he venture to dissent, a crack of the whip or the spur, would bring him to his senses. Even a rational creature, that may be supposed to have more fortitude, is usually in subjection to the master, in matter of opinion, where he is a slave. It is for this reason that slaves are excluded. — Whatever might plausibly be said as to the expediency of extending the privilege of citizenship to those animals that are feræ naturæ, and are at their own hands in a forest, it is quite another matter as far as it respects domesticated animals, that have no will of their own, but are under dominion, whether subjugated to a plough or a team. The wild animals that roam, have some spirit of independence. They would starve before they would tamely submit themselves to arbitrary rule, and government. Hence it is, that traps are used. It requires shooting to bring some of them to terms. But an ox may be goaded into acquiescence. He does not drink whiskey, it is true; and for that reason, it cannot be said that whiskey will purchase him; but is there nothing to be done with good grass? The inticements are various that might be held out to allure from the independence of his own judgment. As to horses voting on the occasion we are speaking of, so far as matter of fact is concerned, I admit it has been denied. For, that though a great number of horses were seen to be ridden up; yet it is usual to go on horseback to elections, especially when the voters have to come from some distance; so that the mere circumstance of being on the ground, is no conclusive evidence of having given a vote; and this I am the more careful to note, as in the case of a new government, that like an individual, has a character, in some measure, to establish, it is of moment, that what is groundlessly alleged, be explained. At the same time, I am aware of the impolicy of denying a thing in toto where there is any foundation;— were there no other reason that would induce an historian to adhere to the truth. For even where a man is pressing a matter that is difficult to be believed, and he has nothing in truth to concede, he will yield a little, skilfully, in order to give the impression of candour, and secure belief to the more important points. How much more does it behoove a writer to be careful of insisting on the freedom from all blame on the part of those whom he advocates, lest that he bring in question the veracity of his relation, where he has every thing on his side. I do not therefore say positively, that the inspectors and judges of the election, in some districts, were not deceived, and their vigilance baffled; or that they did not connive. For that would be saying too much, considering the nature of affairs. The most vigilant cannot always watch; and the most severe in their notions of the rights of persons, may indulge. But, granting that some horse creatures did vote, with their riders on their backs, does it follow that the inspectors had notice of it; or that the persons who usually stand by and vouch for the right of suffrage to the individual, were not to blame.— They may have announced their names as rational persons; and under that idea, may have got their votes taken. I have been the more careful in throwing out these hints, because if it were once admitted that such votes did pass, unless surreptitiously, and sub silentio, it might grow into precedent. And we well know, that in matters of political and legal law, precedent has the force of authority. It may be suggested as not fairly presumable that inspectors and judges could be deceived. I have seen too much of elections not to think that practice to be unfair, where an individual, powerful for wealth or family, is a candidate, or where there is a contest of party somewhat violent; and unprincipled and daring individuals, will take their stations, and act as common vouchers on an election day, as to the name, age, freedom, or estate of the person who offers a vote. He will be supported by pugilists, or persons prepared with clubs, who though they do not actually strike, will menace with this appearance of force, and intimidate those who might dispute the vouching that is given. I consider all this as immoral and unbecoming a good citizen. But I Vol. IV. C have seen even inspectors and judges intimidated by this shew of hostility; and I would not wonder if I were to hear that under this awe, in some places, improper votes were taken. Not that I would excuse this timidity of officers, as lessening it from a misdemeanor, to a mere neglect of duty. I reprehend both the overawing and the being overawed in the discharge of a public trust. But in justice to the character of the country, I incline to think after all that has been reported to the contrary, that instances of beasts voting were more rare than is imagined; and that a considerable foundation of what has gone abroad on this head, was the epithets bestowed by the contending parties calling one another beasts; such as horses, asses, sheep, buffaloes, oxen, and the names of other cattle. All this metaphorically, just as persons of a less polished education, where they dispute on literary or theological subjects, call each other geese, sucking pigs, or turkey-buzzards. I have heard even well bred persons speak of their antagonists after a warm debate, as wood-peckers and mire-snipes. In political controversies, it is no uncommon thing to bestow the epithets of jack-ass. I have heard even an accomplished lady, use the term monkey, speaking of an individual of the other sex. It would be endless to enumerate such instances of the application of terms, that do not in themselves import the natural form or metamorphose of any person. CHAPTER V. THE day of the election being over, people applied quietly to their usual employments, those of them that were in a capacity to discharge the duties of their functions. Some of them were not capable. And amongst these the visionary philosopher was not in a condition to present himself at the levee of the Governor; but was in the hands of the surgeon, having received a blow with a bludgeon, as he was leading up a merino ram, and insisting for a vote. The Governor himself had been indisposed the whole day of the election, but being now recovered, and the legislature about to meet shortly, it behooved him to think of an address to the representative body. This he was at a loss, whether in the mode of the kings of England, personally, reading the speech himself or having it read for him, in his presence, or whether to adopt that introduced in these states, since the revolution; or rather in this, a later period of the republican history, by sending a message, that is, a written document to be communicated by the Secretary. The message has the advantage in this, that it is a departure from the English precedent, which of itself carries reason. But there is more in it when we consider that it is more convenient. Because when a man makes a speech orally, it is not all of it that can be heard in the crowd that usually assembles on the occasion of an inauguration. And when it is heard, it is not all of it that can be recollected. Many things escape the memory. Whereas when it is by way of written document it can be heard to his satisfaction; not that it would be decent to encore it on the floor of the house; but members can recur to it from time to time, and read it themselves. In that case, they are not kept so long standing on their feet, as when it is heard slowly, and with much ceremony of bringing it forward in the first instance. For the waiting the arrival of the Governor that is to deliver the speech; and the arrangements that must be made for the places of the other officers of government, and the body of the representatives, is tedious; and it ought to be a principle in public, as it is in private life, to consult ease where it answers no good purpose to take trouble. Almost all unnecessary ceremony is displeasing to a man of sense. The finest expression that I have met with on this head, is in the Arcadia of Sir Philip Sidney. “There was ceremony without being ceremonious.” I have some impression in my mind of having quoted this very expression somewhere else in this or some other book, but I cannot recollect with certainty, nor have I time to turn back and examine. It is very possible that I repeat the same ideas in many places, but what of that, if a good thing is twice said. This beautiful remain of the genius of that time, is addressed, if I remember right, to his sister the Marchioness of Pembroke. It is of her that the Epitaph is written. Underneath this marble hearse, Lies the subject of all verse; Sidney's sister, Pembroke's mother— Death, ere thou hast kill'd another, Wise, and good, and fair as she; Time shall throw a dart at thee, You will say this is a digression. There is no doubt but it is. But can it be said that I indulge myself much in this way? On the contrary, are there many writers that stick closer to their subject than I have in general done. Besides I would not write a syllable of what I am now writing, were it not that it is thought necessary, that I should not leave my book at a short angle; but round it off, by giving it something like a natural conclusion. And the truth is, as my ideas are in a great measure exhausted; I mean those that are near the surface; I have not time to fish for such as swim in deep water; or to wait, having taken all that were of a larger size, until the small fry grow bigger. So that whenever a thought leads me into a quotation, I do not make a scruple of conscience, to run after it; especially if I have any reason to think, upon the small reflection I can give it, that the quotation will be better than the original idea that might have taken place of it. So far as respects my own taste, I read with great pleasure oftentimes a book, which has not a single idea in it from beginning to end, except in the quotations. The only question that is made, will be, is the quotation from a good author; or does it amuse, or instruct. Nor in reading good moral observations, or anecdotes of great men, do I care whether they are in a connected series, or strung together like Swift's “Tritical dissertation on the faculties of the human mind.” The apothegms of Plutarch are somewhat in the same way. The chapters of Athenæus, and the noctes atticæ of Aulius Gellius, are of the same rambling sort of composition. Montaigne's essays also; and some of the introductory chapters of Henry Fielding. The fact is, that as a regularly bred cook will shew his skill in the culinary art, by making a savoury dish out of a bit of soal leather; or a whole entertainment out of ordinary materials; so, it may depend upon the manner, more than the matter of what is said, whether it be acceptable. Unquestionably there are but few that have the rare talent of saying things agreeably; and I am not sure that I have shewn that art in any degree in this book. But what hinders aiming at it, by those who feel a benevolence of heart, and wish to please. If any man is amused by any of these images that I am endeavouring to paint, he will be under obligation to me, though he may refuse to acknowledge it. It is allowable towards the end of a book to digress; and in the manner of old age deal in narrative. Though I will acknowledge that I have seldom met with old men who were not apt to digress too much in their narrations. That old men are more talkative than those of earlier years, is characteristic. “Garrulous old age.” But that they are apt to digress is not so generally noted; though it would seem to me to be the case, and were it put upon me to account for it, looking into nature at my own age, I would resolve it into the multiplicity of ideas as one cause. They are numerous, and press for utterance; and when a certain set have had an outlet in part, the speaker suspends awhile the prosecuting them, and goes back to fetch others. It would be like Charon in his boat upon the river Styx, were there an island in it, ferrying a number of the shades half way; leaving them on the island, and going back to bring others that distance, who are crowding on the shore, and anxious to cross. Or like a mechanic, that has a great number of customers, and cannot satisfy, but by beginning the work of several, and C 2 carrying it on by pieces; having it in his power to say to all that their work is on hands. But I return to say something on the subject of ceremony, the point from whence we digressed. For the forms of taking place, or seats, or at least the coming into the government house, partakes something of the nature of ceremony in polite assemblies, on other occasions. All attention to which, and the trouble of it, is avoided by the transmitting what is to be said, in the shape of what is called a message, which may be carried by the secretary and laid on the table. Having adopted the mode of address by message, it was prepared, and transmitted to the legislature, now convened. We have been furnished with an extract of some part of it, which we shall now introduce. CHAPTER VI. IT will not be understood, that I am to give the whole message, at full length; which would be unnecessary, as I think it is full time, that in the addresses, or messages of Governors, in most instances, the common place parts might be omitted; such as what respects improvements of roads, encouragement of domestic manufactures, and the making a new militia law, felicitating on abundant harvests; or complimenting the administration of the general government, which comes also under this head. There are many like common place subjects which it were tedious to enumerate, but which may, in this instance, be considered as disposed of. We hasten to the main matter which the Governor touched upon, the particular situation and affairs of the new government. I cannot do better than just to make an extract in his own words. It is the concluding part, and the plainest in point of expression. For there is a certain stateliness and dignity in the stile of such compositions that is excusable in the initiatory, or perambulatory part, that need not be observed so punctiliously in what relates to real business Tropes need not rise so rapidly, nor need these be taken so much from lofty objects in nature; such as billows of the ocean, or tempests on the land. All may be simple, like that of information, or opinion given in common cases. The extract which we give relates to a matter which may be supposed to have occupied the mind of his excellency, the innovations projected by the visionary philosopher and which had got some footing in the minds of the people, respecting a change in the extent of suffrage at elections, and the right of being elected, consequent upon it. For if any but those under the denomination of rational persons, could elect, other than rational persons might be elected. For, similia a similibus gignuntur. But that he might not give offence, by attacking a prejudice abruptly, he approached the subject circuitously, by talking of the promotion of knowledge, and the establishment of schools. But I continue to talk of the message, rather than to give it. Here it is, that part of it that we have spoken of. “I would not be understood as meaning to insinuate, even in the most distant manner, a deficiency of natural understanding, or any extraordinary want of information in the members of your honourable body. I am the more careful to suggest this, because of the known prejudices which the inhabitants of the sea-coasts entertain, in favour of themselves. Because, from the greater opportunities they have of ships arriving, they may have information of the affairs of Europe, sooner than we have, they may be disposed to attribute this, to a greater facility of apprehension. And because, they have schools and colleges of an older foundation, and more accessible from the propinquity of situation. Hence they are led to think that their possessing more scientific knowledge is owing to themselves, and not to this advantage. The truth is that in point of talent, so far as this includes the capacity of acquring learning, or judging solidly, I take it the ultramontane people are before those of the cities or of the towns, and settlements on the sea-coast: not that in this case I resolve it into a superior strength of the brain, so much, as into the circumstance of better air on the mountains than in the cities; unless indeed I except those just on the sea-board, and where they have the benefit of the salt breeze. It may not be that they possess stronger, but only clearer brain. For if the marshes and the low grounds, overflowed in some part, with the rivers, infect the atmosphere with damps, and vapours, that affect the body, how can the brain, which is a part of the body, escape, being muddied with what naturalists call the effluviæ, and physicians, the miasmata, which are the cause of this? Are the draught cattle of these places, of the activity of those of the hills? Our horses are a smaller breed, but they are more alert on a journey. Our wild beasts in general, are more agile in their movements, and seem to have more resources of cunning, and foresight than the tame; but even domesticated quadrupeds with us seem to be like the human species, in the same regions; that is, of a superior cast to the denizens of the low country. No wonder, for the barometer will shew the difference that exists in the gravity of the atmosphere. And running, and jumping itself, is more favourable to clearness of head, than standing behind a counter, and casting up figures. If I were to take one of these so employed in order to enlighten him, the first thing I would do, would be to apprehend him by the locks, and to set him on the top of a hill, to look about him for a while. I would shake him well, before I would set him down to his lesson. A man's ideas in a shop, are in proportion to the size of the room; he thinks narrowly, if not meanly, who has not more than a few yards of prospect for the greater part of the twenty-four hours in the day. We acquire the magnitude of surrounding objects, and our conceptions enlarge by the space that presents itself. Why is it that all great generals look for the rising and upper ground in engagements? It is because it improves courage. The mere circumstance of striking to more advantage, from the higher part of the inclining plain, is not all. There is a great deal in the bare imagination. The paradox of the schools, crede quod habes, et habes, is not true; but thinking that you can conquer, goes a great way to give the victory. And the soldier that has his head higher than his adversary, is led naturally, by a kind of incalculable impulse, to think that he can subdue him. I do not wonder, therefore, if upon these reflections, and ascribing too much to such secret operations of the mind; derived from the elevation of a range of hills, the visionary philosopher that has come amongst us, may have been encouraged to think that even our beasts might be capable of an extraordinary cultivation. At the same time, whatever may be my prepossessions in favor of a reform, I have not been able to entertain sentiments equally saguine with some worthy citizens, on this particular I consider it rather the offspring of a disturbed mind of some sea-coast politician, that has broached this doctrine, or would induce a community to adopt the hypothesis; and this, not so much out of respect to the powers of mind with us, as complimentary to their own vanity, who have been able to excogitate the imagination. If it is not rather meditated as an insult, being as much as to say, the difference is so small between you and your cattle, that there can be no conclusive reason, or cogent argument, why you might not be put upon the same footing. For as the parallax of remote stars seems small, and we consider them to the naked eye, as together; so it is in the light of an imputation of inferiority in the human species here, that I have taken up the suggestion. For why did they not begin with their own beasts in the lower country, to ameliorate their condition, and extend their rights? They have been visionary enough, in all conscience, with their abolition of the common law, and other innovations; but they have not come so far as to talk of naturalizing cattle, strictly speaking; though some of their naturalizations have been of very uncouth persons. It is not sufficient that the heat and moisture of the climate may produce yellow fever in their towns, but that political pestilences spread from thence. However able you may be as a body, yet if a few bullocks, hide and tallow, were actually mixed among you, by means of the intrigues of these people, you might become the subject of ridicule, instead of admiration;—No—if pards and bears are to be admitted to appear, or officiate in any department of representative capacity, it ought to be at the bar, where noise may be better tolerated, and growling may pass for ability. The late disorderly elections in the districts, was owing to this very proposition of giving beasts votes; whereas in the opinion of most persons, if any were sober, on that day, there were beasts enough on the ground, if I may be allowed to call them so, in a comparative way of speaking, who, on these occasions, can reconcile it to themselves to cheat and to wrangle in support of the frauds they have committed. It is in this sense of the word that the Apostle Paul speaks, when he says, he “fought with beasts at Ephesus;” not as some take it, that he was exposed to wild beasts, in the amphitheatre, according to the barbarous custom of the Romans. If all the election laws that can be framed are ineffectual to restrain breaches of the peace, even now, while men only are allowed the privilege of voting, how would it be, if the elective franchise was enlarged to creatures that have claws, or horns, or hoofs. The biting, and the gouging would be encreased; and there would be so many tame animals at least beaten, and bruised, that they would be unfit for the services of agriculture which will leave the husbandmen without the means of tilling their ground, or getting in their crops. On all these considerations, the scheme, or project, as it may be better called, appears to me fraught with inconveniences; and to be a reform, at this time, not practicable. “The abuses of the late election, whether any in the way of improper votes admitted, it would not become me to insinuate, nor do I insinuate, as to what may have taken place, but what has been advocated as a possible reform. You are yourselves judges of the legality of your own elections; and seeing neither tails among you, nor manes on any of your shoulders, I take it for granted you are all men, and have been elected by such. For though an hundred or two horse votes may have been counted; or a kid, or a merino ram here, or there, may have got his nose in the dish, it does not follow that it has made the difference of a representative in any one case. The purity of the elective franchise, is the first gem of liberty; it is the bud at which it breaks forth. If the frost of fraud blights, no fruit springs from the tree. The prevention of fraud is the object of the laws; but the distinguishing the objects of trust, is equally important. That must remain with the citizens at large.” The message of his excellency, couched in these wary words; was, nevertheless, unfavourably received by the members present, and those of the country attending. The contortions in the visages of them, expressed disapprobation. The words aristocracy were muttered. The physiognomy of some had the appearance of one whom an inexpert barber was shaving with a bad razor; there was screwing, and twisting of the features; and a wry countenance at the greater part of the words read. CHAPTER VII. FROM the right of suffrage, to the right of delegation, the transition was easy; and hence the idea of admiting beasts to a vote in elections, naturally led to that of beasts being voted for, and elected to a representative body. Why not, said an advocate for this policy Because said an adversary, they cannot speak; brutum pecus that have no utterance; not even to say aye, or no. That is the very reason, said the other, that it behooves to chuse such delegates. What do we not suffer from the verbiage, and loquacity of members? A measure of peace or war cannot be carried but over the belly of a thousand harangues protracted to an immeasurable length, by orators that know as little of the subject as a whipperwill, or a jaybird; and yet chatter continually so as to prevent the question being taken. Commend me to a brute beast, a buffalo, or sheep that would chew the cud, and hold its tongue. If there were at least a mixture of those, there would be fewer speakers, and take up less time. Unless you gag a member, he will speak even though no one would wish him to open his mouth, unless to take a quid of tobacco. If an elk, or a horse were to speak, he would make the speach short, if we were to infer from that pithy speech made by Balaam's ass; coming to the point at once, and saying all in a few words, that most of your human orators now-a-days in deliberative bodies, would chuse to say in a speech of many hours. These would seem to make conscience of giving quantity for quality, and this is the only apology that can be made for interminable rhapsodies. Nor is it enough that they waste time in speaking, but they must write out what they have said and trouble the public with conceptions in the papers; crude as they would seem to be, and tire some to read. If any one should undertake to travel through them; it can only be such as have much leisure on their hands, and at a loss to know what to do with their time. But the mischief is not altogether to be avoided by the not reading them, because the journals are taken up with such effusions in the place of which something better might be selected for the public. There is a double advantage in a brute animal to whom nature had denied the power of speech, in being a member of congress because in this casethere is usually denied to such, the talent of writing speeches. If a member, conscious to himself of not excelling in extempore eloquence should hold his tongue, like a dum creature, yet it is ten to one but he will write speeches that he has saved from his prolixity, yet the press is made to groan under the oppression of his verbosity. Give we a young colt that will say little, rather than a jackanapes of the human species that will be eternally on the floor. I am for sending a few asses, not figuratively, but literally, to our council, who will bray, but will do no more than bray a reasonable length of time, and suffer the more intelligent of the members to arrange and carry through the business. No ass brays more than a few minutes at a time, unless you pinch it, or occasion it uneasiness in some way. Whether is it more against nature to send nominally something else; but, in fact an ass? If a beast of the forest should go to the house, he will not be continually turning his head round to listen, and to hear what other beasts say of his speeches, or his vote. He will be more independent of his constituents that are running at large upon the hills, or in the pasture, nor will the idea come into his head, that he is bound by their instructions; a thing inconsistent with the delegating representatives to think where they will have a better opportunity of knowing what is for the good of the commonwealth. If this doctrine is correct, it is the constituent that stays at home that is to think, and the representative that goes to a public body, not to think at all; at least not to make use of his thoughts; which by the bye, is an argument for beasts going, and men staying at home. Will the desire of popularity induce your wild, or tame cattle to make long speeches or to regard what Tom, Dick, or Harry may say about their votes? they may be led to prolong the session for the sake of oats and corn, which they have in their mangers; but, it will not be by many words that this will be done. One cause, at least, of the mischief will be struck away. The desire of members to retain their seats, and procure a re-election, will not exist so strong with the denizens of the woods Vol. IV. D and fields, who will naturally not have the same attachment to a house, as human creatures that are accustomed to be within doors. On all these grounds, there will be more independence in our councils, and less subservience to popular opinion. Individuals will not be continually looking out to see which way the wind blows; nor will they covet place, and preferment so much, looking out to be ambassadors; or to have other appointments abroad, or at home. I am for keeping at home, at least a portion, of the servile pecus, and sending real cattle to the public bodies. One advantage farther; there would be no canabalism in the blockheads of the human shape that are sent with them, knocking down a member bullock at the end of a session; nor would there be an inconvenience in riding a colleague horse home. Sir, said an adversary, your ject seems to be to burlesque a representative government. I deny it, said the advocate; it is to burlesque the abuses of elections, and of the elective franchise.— If people go to employ a mechanic, or manufacturer of any sort, they look out for a capable person; one skilled in the art, or occupation, and with science and experience requisite for the thing to be made, or the object to be accomplished. But, to manage the affairs of a nation, nothing more is sought than simply the being of a party; or the being capable of being made so by some master of the drama at home in a village or district. It is never enquired whether he has two legs or four, provided he answers the purpose of a junto in a neighbourhood. Hence—what? “Words that breathe, and thoughts that burn.” No; stupidity or local selfishness; and words, in order to hide in the rubbish, the want of ideas. If that is the case, said the adversary, and you do not mean to advocate the giving beasts suffrages, or sending them as representatives, I have no quarrel with you.— What these people will do, into whose hands it has been put, is more than I can tell. It is said to be an easy thing to raise the devil; but to lay him, requires all the art of the free-mason with a wand, circle, and a black cat. I do not think it would do any great harm if it was tried, said the advocate. The truth is, I am so much dissatisfied with this mischief in sending incompetent persons to represent us in legislative bodies, talking a long time and saying nothing, or worse than nothing, that I must either laugh or cry; and I think it is as well to laugh; to be Democritus, rather than Heraclitus. But if there is any remedy for this evil, it must be ridicule; and I am willing to try my hand a little at it. If a cow or a horse was chosen, people would begin to think; by pushing the thing to an extremity, the contrast is better seen. If a dumb beast should obtain a majority of suffrages, it would be asked why he did not obtain such a seat; and it would be answered, because he was dumb; and in that case could not be a long-speaking member. But is there no remedy for these things upon principle? said the adversary. I know of none, said the advocate unless the having fewer members, might curtail a little, there not being so many to take up time; or the putting muzzles on them like young calves; but that would keep them from eating as well as speaking.— Ridicule, by sending a young bull to the house, because he would hold his tongue; except bellowing a little, will, I take it, be found the ultimate remedy. A very few members, were they so disposed, would take as much time as the greater number, unless there were so very few that they could not relieve each other when out of breath. Loquacity is the fashion of the day; and I wish to bring taciturnity back again, which has been out of date almost since the school of Pythagoras. I will have, at least, a reasonable proportion of dumb creatures put up at our elections, and sent to the representative bodies. This was a dialogue, aside, between the advocate for the eligibility of beasts, and the individual who opposed it; it had little effect, one way or the other, not being in the presence of the multitude. CHAPTER VIII. THE people were naturally led from the idea of property giving the right of suffrage, to that of the property itself exercising this right; and herds and flocks propria persona, coming forward viva voce, or with a ticket; and this by an association of ideas, introduced that of being capable of being elected. But it did not occur to them until suggested, that the representative is chosen, or in contemplation of the constitution, supposed to be chosen for his superior knowledge and information over that of the constituent. At least it ought to be a principle upon which the selection is founded. And in the original of the English constitution, we find the representatives were called the wittena gemote, or the assembly of the wise men. Nor when it was suggested, did it stick much with them. Nevertheless, they thought it not amiss to give the beasts some education; provided their nature was improvable, which, from what was heard of the learned pig, could not longer remain doubtful. “Man differs more from man, than man from beast,” says the poet. This being the case, it might be tried how far a four-footed creature could be taught the arts and sciences, or instructed in the principles of morality, or the rules of good breeding; not to go so far as to constitute colleges, and academies for their use; but common reading and writing, or, perhaps, arithmetic as far as the rule of three. There are philosophers who assert, with great plausibility, that the highest powers of reasoning, are but a gradation from vegetable life. If so, it must be a greater start from the tendril of a vine to a vernacular substance than from the creeping thing to that which walks on all fours. From thence to the human species, is a leap not more extraordinary. That man may have been once an oyster, was the opinion of Darwin; but that he might have been at least a ground squirrel, was the opinion of the visionary philosopher. Of this character I have already made honourable mention, in my introduction to the history of the beasts voting. He was sanguine in the undertaking to instruct and civilize the brutes. Nay, to fit them for offices, and the discharge of trusts in the community. He had caught a young panther, and, with a chain about its neck, had put it to study law with a young man of that profession, who wishing to get forward in business, thought it would do him no harm, though it might not do the panther much good. There were those who bore testimony against this, being of opinion that lawyers were bad enough, even when made of the best materials. They were supported in this opinion by some reflecting persons who could not conceive that this animal could ever be made capable of explaining a matter to a jury; or stating a point of law to the court. What is it, said the philosopher, whether he may ever be able to explain himself intelligibly at the bar. Cannot he grin, bite, squeal, and shake his tail? Is it with sense, that a jury, or a court, are always moved most? I wish to prove that reason goes but a little way to make learned counsel. The main matter is to satisfy the client; who will be oftentimes better pleased to lose his cause in the hands of one that will make a noise, than to gain it by him who says little. At least he will have less scruple in paying him. For he will not say, you had not much trouble; you said but a word or two; not considering that a rifle shot, is more certain and deadly than any quantum of sound. An ecclesiastic was at hand, who had an antipathy to vociferators, being himself a man of a weak voice; and took this opportunity to express himself against declaimers. It is true, said he, the sound of rams' horns blew down the walls of Jericho; but that was a most extraordinary blast.— And not to be drawn into precedent, said a lawyer who was by. It was an extraordinary blast, continued the ecclesiastic.— But the human voice is stronger than any wind, said the visionary philosopher. No wind blowing will shock an army like that of the shout of a main body about to engage, though since the invention of gunpowder, except among the savages, shouting is not in practice. D 2 The blowing down the walls of Jericho with the sound of a ram's horn, resumed the ecclesiastic, was a most extraordinary blast. But recollect, that in another part of the scripture it is said, “the Lord was not in the whirlwind, but in the still small voice.” CHAPTER IX. WERE it imposed upon me as a task, by some republic, to educate a number of young persons to be orators, in order to introduce a good taste for public speaking, I would begin with the understanding. What? not with the heart; it will be said. I take that to be the same thing. For I know no difference between good sense, and virtue, except that the one is the judgment of what is virtuous, and the other the practice. I take a knave and a fool to have only this difference, that the fool is a knave in his transactions without meaning to be so; the other intends it. Or, if this way of putting the argument will not be understood, I say that every man who knowing the right, intends the wrong, is not wise; that is, a fool. Above all things, give me a good judgment as the foundation of morals: and the communicating knowledge is strengthening the judgment. I admit that there is such a thing as being of a bad stock; and the moral qualities are as communicable as the physical constitution, or the features. Hence it is, that I would look to the stock in the selection of subjects; but still more to the physiognomy of the youth himself. For I think it possible that Curran, who cannot but have a good heart, yet may be of a germ from one of the worst stock that ever trod the bogs. I should have a great curiosity to trace his ancestry. I say, I cannot think but that he must have a good heart; because it is impossible for a cold heart to be warm; and a heart to be warm that has not a love of virtue. His eloquence is to me prima facie proof at least, that he is benevolent. But pursuing my observations on the main point, I say, to form an orator I would cultivate the understanding. What is eloquence, but good sense expressed in clear language. The vox, et preterea nihil; voice without sense, is provoking. I grant that sound may do a great deal; but it is but as the rushing wind. The effect of a persuasive speech is like the moving force of waters. The tide rises without noise; but the effect is irresistible. By the precepts of one whose experience has enabled him to judge of these things, a bad habit may be prevented or corrected. But it is the application only that can confirm the precepts. Hence it is that there is no forming an orator, but when the attaining some object by the speaker elicits his powers. A man that has his life at stake, and what is next to this, has his daily bread to get by his mouth, will not miss the thought, the word, the pathos to accomplish his purpose. Hence it is that the bar is the only school in our government for real eloquence.— In the deliberate assemblies, the speaker is thinking of his constituents, and is a slave sent forward to serve a party founded at home. I would sooner drag a cart than be a representative upon such conditions. Hence it is that a man of talents has no prospect in a public body, but to make himself unpopular; unless on some occasion when the people are alarmed for themselves, and party and intrigue is put down by the danger of the occasion. It is thus in a storm, or other perils in life, abilities are in request. At other times they are the object of envy, and combination to bring down. Application to any science, and the acquisition of knowledge in general, is a drudgery in the first stages; and hence it is natural for the youth to excuse himself; and to hope that by the more easy exertion of his lungs, and the blowing of his mouth, he can supply the defect of thought. It is vexatious to the person who has laboured to acquire knowledge, and has been led to depend upon the effect of solid reasoning, to find that blustering will go as far as it does; but it ought to be his consolation and he will literally find it the fact, that of solid talents, it may be said, as it is said of truth, great is the force thereof, and it will prevail. Magna est veritas, et prevalebit. For solidity in mental talent is truth; and the appearance of intellect where it is not, is the false. One of the best things that I ever heard by a lawyer to excuse himself to his client for having misled him in defending, or bringing a suit, I forget which, where he ought not; was, on the honest man saying, did you not tell me I had the law on my side? And did I not tell the court so too? said the lawyer. Did you? said the client. Yes. The man could say no more. It would have been unreasonable; especially as the advocate had made as much noise as any one could reasonably expect in asserting his conceptions. But had he been informed properly in his profession, his embarrassment might not have occurred, nor his presence of mind rendered it necessary; which, as it is what one cannot always command it may be well to be without the necessity of it.— Not that I mean to say, that any powers of intellect can anticipate what may be the way of thinking of a court and jury. There is such a thing as a by stander thinking differently from both. But that in general the public judgment, both as to merits of the cause, and the ability of those who manage or dispose, goes according to the truth. This is a consolation to the industrious; and the diligent student who places his dependence on solid, not on shewy qualifications. At the same time, the garnishing is not to be neglected. The voice is capable of formation in point of sweetness as well as force. In point of sweetness, by diligent attention, and lending the ear to those who speak musically; in point of force, by exercise alone. It is as necessary to observe the key at which to begin to speak, as for a musician in singing; so that he may retain the command of his voice under every passion to be expressed. It is to be observed that reading well is a different talent from speaking; and does not altogether depend upon equal cultivation. I leave this to be accounted for; I only repeat the fact. Action is the last; the ancients thought not least advantage of a speaker. That can be true only of the oratory proper for a popular assembly. That must be extremely guarded and chastised, that is used at the bar. For the least suspicion in the minds of a jury, that the passions are attempted, will excite distrust of even a good argument, and injure it. At the same time, while human nature is susceptible of the impressions of grace and dignity, the manner of an orator must have a great effect. Hence it is that I recommend even attention to dress; not so much in the cloth, as in the fullness, and flowing of the vestment, which appears to make the orator loom more. I have an impression of having treated upon these particulars in the preceding pages, and that I may seem to repeat. But if any one finds fault, I charge him home with an expression of the scripture, “line upon line, precept upon precept, here a little, and there a little.” It may be said that some of my lines, and precepts, and littles, may be pretty good; but that there is a great deal of trash. That this may be the case, I have acknowledged heretofore. But would the more valuable be read without the less? I applied to a hatter the other day to make me a hat; and requested him to make me one entirely of beaver, and not to mix racoon. The truth is, I thought he would charge me as much for the one as the other, and therefore I might as well have the best.— But he informed me that a little racoon mixed with the beaver would make a better hat than one all beaver. It may be so with my book, which is calculated for all capacities; and a mixture of images drawn from high and low life, with painting serious and ludicrous, may conduce to the being more read; and lasting longer in the world. Or should it not be read, and that object fail, it is amusing to one's self to indulge variety; to discumb and to rise. CHAPTER X. A Yankee trick in the mean time had been discovered, disgraceful to the land of steady habits, even though it was at the expense of the English government; and they might be considered as deserving no favour, and scarcely fair dealing. But it is one thing to merit punishment, by retributary injury, and another, to have the right of inflicting it. Hearing that the scalps of families of the United States, were in request in Canada, a premium being paid for these, by the British government, two young men of Connecticut, having entered into partnership, devised the scheme of cutting up into patches of a proper size, with the hair on, the furs of muskrats, and martins newly flayed, with a view to make the appearance of green scalps; and to vend them to John Bull. They were called to an account before the Chief Justice; they justified themselves on the ground, that the British government in Canada were in the habit of counterfeiting treasury notes, and bank bills of the United States; and why not forge or counterfeit scalps, in return? Could John Bull complain that false scalps were passed upon him, for which his premium in gold and silver was received; since this was done without actually scalping a human being. The Chief Justice did not see well what could be said to this defence. It was a kind of retaliation, and might have the effect of lowering the price of scalps, and thereby reduce the demand, which would in that degree lessen the taking them. It might also contribute to breed a difference between them and their scalp-taking auxiliaries, or allies, by an imputation upon Tecumsey as privy to the fraud. For scalps having got into the market, it could not readily be distinguished what had been sold by the Indian tribe, or by brother Jonathan trading with his cart. On these foundations of public policy, the young men were acquitted, and dismissed, but it was recommended to them, to be cautious in the business, and not to scalp any human person by mistake, especially of that settlement. If they should scalp a few Johnny Bulls of their own country, who justified old John in all things, it would not be so much matter. But to license such a thing on the part of the government would not do; or even to go so far as to give it countenance; because in carrying the thing into effect, great abuses might take place. If it could be confined to leaders, O— P—, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. it would be of little moment. Old Bull, it is true, might resent the fraud doubly, as taking his own scalps to palm them upon him for those of the democrats. A little round Englishman, who had been tooth-drawer to a lap-dog, but was now in this country, said it would have been determined otherwise, according to the law of nations, by a court in England. CHAPTER XI. IT being some time since the preceding part of this memoir has been published, and an opportunity given of hearing the strictures, and criticisms, that have been made, or that passed upon it; it has not escaped the knowledge of the author, that some have thought the particulars, in some instances, extravagant, and bordering on the incredible; which is contrary to the maxim of sticking at least to an appearance of truth. But how can any one undertake to say what is extravagant, or what is incredible? Who is there at this day, who will call in question the truth of the rise and progress of the Corsican adventurer; and yet this borders upon the marvellous. At a future day, when the lights of history have been obscured, who knows but his adventures, when written, may be laid on the same shelf with that of Amadis, of Gaul; Don Bellianis, of Greece; or a small book, entitled, the history of the seven Champions of Christendom? It is in the cards, to use a phrase taken from the gamblers, and not at all improbable, that his fall may be as rapid, and not less extraordinary than his ascent.* * This was written some years ago. In fact, the greater part of this volume is printed from scraps furnished by the author, from his port folio, in consequence of our signifying an inclination to publish a new edition of his work. It is perhaps somewhat owing to a defect in the narration, that an air of improbability is thrown upon a history by not entering sufficiently into a detail of the transactions. There is a remarkable instance of this, in the history of the American war, by Ramsey, in which he notices the capture of three vessels, and 1500 men of the British by a stratagem. Perhaps not 1500, for I have not the book before me; but certainly some hundreds. All this by four of a Georgia regiment, and an old negro, a waiter. It was in all the Gazettes of the time; but the details were not given. It is also mentioned by General Lee, in his memoirs; who, though he gives some particulars, yet is not minute in his statement of the circumstance. There is no doubt of the fact, however; nor would it appear doubtful to any one, provided Vol. IV. E the circumstances were minutely stated, which led to the success. But it is not consistent with the object of this work, to introduce this narrative by way of episode. I mention it only as an instance, that the improbable is not always false. The study of brevity, is a cause of the omission of incidents; an unwillingness to detain the reader. And yet the great charm of ancient historians, is the minuteness of painting. But I will say for myself, and at the same time, it may be an apology for other historians, that the extreme study of brevity arises frequently from too much sensibility to public opinion; too great a fear of wearying the reader. We are not sure that what we relate is of sufficient importance to engage attention; and we endeavour to crowd the more into a narrow space. This is an attempt to make up by condensing, what the material itself wants in its quality. But the want of probability has not been an observation in the mouths of all readers of this work. On the contrary, it has been thought by some, that the incidents have been all common and natural, that there is nothing improbable in them; and that the triteness of occurrence, rather than the unusual, and extravagant, ought to be the objection. What extraordinary can there be, say some, in such a creature as Teague O'Regan receiving appointments to office, or being thought qualified for the discharge of the highest trusts? Do we not see instances every day of the like? Is it possible to say how low the grade of human intellect that may be thought capable of transacting public business? It will be seen in the subsequent part of this narrative that the joke has been carried farther than the lowest possible capacity of what is found amongst men; not just a block of wood, for that would be assigning intellectual functions to an inanimate substance. And yet, even this has not been without a parallel in the history of the human mind, as to what has been one subject of the belief of nations. Did not some even make gods of stocks and stones, assigning to them celestial natures, and placing them above a mortal existence? Under this impression some have been forward enough to tell me, that, so far from my bog-trotter being a burlesque upon human credulity, and pretension to office, that the bulk of men in office are below even his qualifications; and that if I were to go into any deliberative body, and pull out the first man that occurred to me, nine times out of ten I would find that I had a Teague O'Regan by the tail. I have no idea that things are just brought to this pass, notwithstanding there may be colour for the allegation. For undoubtedly there is nothing in which men are less disposed to question their fitness, than in what regards the endowments of the mind. A horse not a hunter, will not leap a five-bar gate, nor attempt a ditch of the same number of feet in width, unless he is greatly pushed by the rider. For the animal will have the sagacity to look and compare the distance with what he has been accustomed to surmount. But such is the sanguine temperament of the human mind, that who is there that does not think himself equal to any undertaking? This is the moral of this book, and the object of setting the example of the bog-trotter before the people; not as what is universal in every instance of a candidate for office; but as an instance of what is too common, and which ought to be avoided rather than imitated. For be assured, that so far as my observation goes, it is not the way to happiness, to court an advancement by a rise that is unnatural or to think of being respectable by the mere possession of office, or delegation. The point of honour in such case, is rather that of a private station. But it is experience only, that, with an individual, or with the public, can sufficiently establish a conviction of this truth. It will be said, why has the narrative been so long suspended? For it is now some years since the history had been brought down to the Captain with his pedeseque coming to the settlement; and the sequel of the history begins at that point. The fact is, it was not suspended, as to the writing; but only as to the publication. For it will be seen that the incidents had not only occurred in the years 1805-6, but that they had been committed to paper, with the observations accompanying them, nearly at that time. For it was in those years that the convulsion of public opinion took place, with regard to the formation of a new constitution; and that we had that great struggle in this state to preserve ours; with analogy to which, the disquietude of the public mind, in the new government, has been depicted. For the passions of men being always the same, under like circumstances, they will shew the like ebullitions. It must be admitted that under this new government, the reverses, as they may very properly be stiled, were much more extravagant. And if it is considered as having a relation to what has happened, elsewhere, or has actually happened any where, it must appear outre, as the French stile it, and beyond the life. And therefore in the application, I give notice, that it is to be taken cum grano salis, or with a reasonable drawback. Nullum simile est idem; nor does every picture run upon all fours. There is a likeness, and a better likeness; a resemblance, and an exact picture. But a caricatura is not to come under the rules of painting from the life, or to the life; but on the contrary, of giving you to know what is intended; but at the same time, shewing you something different from the thing itself; in other words, suppressing the beauties, and giving the faults. For, where the graces, and the deformities are mixed in the object, you are apt to fall in love with the deformities, for the sake of the graces. The use therefore of the caricatura, is to put the deformities by themselves, that they may cease to be the object of imitation. Did any one ever see an imitator who did not copy the defects, even though he did not mean to do it? I say nothing of Alexander's courtiers having their necks awry; for that is a common place illustration. But I myself once knew an orator, a man of great powers, who had a kind of grin when he spoke; this, accompanied by some very noble flights of fancy, was rendered pleasing by what followed; but when catched by the imitator, was displeasing. So that what took place in this state, being followed, and carried to excess in the new government, would seem scarcely the same, though it might be evident that it was the same, not in degree, but in kind. But it is with a view to serve future times, that these things are handed down. For the cupidity of man still continuing the same, the like convulsions at no distant day will occur, and unless well managed, will terminate in the overthrow of liberty. For it is only by the permanence of establishments that are constituted on the basis of freedom, that liberty can be preserved. And if constitutions once come to be played with, like battle-dores, there is an end of stability. Every new man, must have a new constitution; for he will wish one to suit himself; and he will have no doubt but that he can make one, that will at least have in it what he wants. Will there be any end to the projects of innovators, in matters of law, and government; especially where the most uninformed are equally entitled to an opinion with those of the greatest experience, or the deepest thought? And to exclude any from the right of having an opinion in public affairs is impracticable, consistent with the enjoyment of liberty. The principle of the right must be acknowledged; what is more, it must be preserved, and cultivated. It is only by reason, or by ridicule, that what is excessive in the exercise of the right, and erroneous in the deductions of the mistaken, can be corrected. In the propagation of a new religion, or in a new tenet of a particular faith, what is moderate will be less likely to prevail in the opinions of men. The absurd is always the most popular, and this upon the principle that artificial tastes are stronger than the natural; and what produces the greatest excitement, is most pleasing to the mind. Hence it is that mere morality, and the dictates of nature and truth in the conduct of men, are undervalued in comparison of the dogmata of fanatical faiths. Unintelligible reveries are better relished in the pulpit than just reasoning on the principles of right and wrong in the actions of men; and incomprehensible theological disquisitions are put into the hands of young people, as more substantial food for the mind than precepts of moral truth, which every step in life will bring into practice, and explain. E 2 CHAPTER XII. THE altercations which took place, were almost general with all ranks of the community, for the perfectibility of man and beast. And whereas some taking the side of the men, and others of the beasts, dwelt pretty much at large in their harangues, upon the want of talent, in the bulk of the community to execute offices, or discharge trusts; so with others, whose argument was the indiscriminate capacity of all persons, it was contended that there was no man so destitute of natural powers as not to be fit for any office. Nay what is more, that even less than what men in general possess, might suffice. As it is the nature of all contraries to run to opposite extremes, so it was even at length carried so far that some undertook to sport an opinion that even that degree of mother wit which some beasts possess, might suffice. In the heat of debate, in the warmth of argument, it was insisted on that the experiment ought to be made. Why did not the Governor appoint some quadruped to office, and see the result? Was there ever any thing ascertained in matters of government, but from experience? Experience was the test of government. We did hear of horses and sheep being in office. This was meant as abuse; and might be the cause why a prejudice had been entertained in making these actually, and bona fide officers of government, or members of the legislature. It contributed much to give currency to this way of thinking, that about this time there came a visionary man from the seat of the general government, who was called the visionary philosopher; and well indeed he might be so called; for he had adopted the opinion of the practicability of the civilizing beasts, and making them members of the community. It was with a view to reduce this system to practice, that he had made an excursion to the new country, conceiving that prejudice in favour of the old system, would be less likely to be in a new country. He had been several months broaching the matter amongst the common people, which is always the way with innovators, before he thought proper to wait upon the Governor, and to broach it. This he had at length done. The Governor, as we have seen, was a man of that mildness of character that he did not decline a conversation on the subject, though he thought it extremely absurd. But affecting to listen to his reasonings, he answered him at length with some abruptness but in a tone of voice softened as much as the nature of the reply would admit. It is a wild project, said he; but I see it must be tried. The people will have their way, and restraint will but dam up the current, and produce a flood that will produce an inundation, and carry all before it. CHAPTER XIII. NOTWITHSTANDING the governor's opinion seemed to be against him, yet the visionary philosopher still persisted in his idea that the brutal nature was capable of cultivation, if not in moral qualities, yet so far as respected the acumen ingenii or the powers of the understanding. He had before this time, turned his attention to the instituting an academy, where he had a number of animals, of different species, and amongst them some squirrels which he had put to study Algebra. Harum Scarum, thought, he had better have begun with music, and taught them to play the fiddle. No jibe, or jeer could move the visionary man from his purpose. He argued that it had been the case with all experiments, that the bulk of mankind were incredulous to the first essays. And hence it was that in medicine, quacks had led the way in all improvements. In the profession of the law, precedent had enslaved. In mathematics, Erra Pater that wrote the book of knowledge, was thought a visionary man, though since his time greater credit has been attached to the casting nativities. The diving bell was an invention of Sir William Phips of New England, and no one had faith in the success of it until he actually explored the galleon at the Bahama Islands, and shewed the treasure he had got from it. Paracelsus died with the secret in his mouth, of the elixir of longevity, owing to which accident, it is perhaps, that men do not live now to the age of a thousand years. Parrots, jays and black birds have been taught to speak; and why not squirrels and racoons? With these reasonings in his head, he was busy in structing certain quadrupeds in their gesticulations, and grimaces, that had the appearance occasionally of disputants. The chattering which some of them exhibited, sounded not a great deal unlike, Bocardo, cesario, ferio, baralipton, Terms which logicians use. A number of horned cattle in an inclosure, he was engaged in disposing to take the floor in turns like members of a legislative body. He had employed a stenographer to take down their speeches in short hand. With these he could use the same liberty that he had been used to take, with members of the human species, which was to make the speeches; or at least to new model them in such a way, as to be a caricature, or an improvement. Stenographer, said I; for I had the curiosity to visit this menagerie; when you make a speech for a bear, as for instance, for that Bruin which I see chained, you will be careful, to make it rough, surly and congruent to nature. The lowing of the cow, and the roaring of the bull, must be translated, into loud sounds, very different from the mewing of the cat, or the squealing of the pig. By all means, said he, every thing in character. Now said I, with respect to a legislature of beasts, it will not be thought a matter of ridicule, to paraphrase what is said as spoken by a buffaloe; or to insinuate the insignifience of a member by calling him a ewe or an ass; or to designate his heaviness in a debate by saying he is a horse; for in this case, all things will be without figure, and the truth. However, the people thought the man deranged; and, it would seem to me, not without reason; especially when he had incurred considerable expense, in purchasing up subjects of tuition. He had trappers in the woods; and horse jockies employed to pick up lively colts that might seem to be of parts, and scarcely a drover passed through the settlement, with black cattle or swine, but he was bartering for a calf, or a shoat. Application had been made to a magistrate for an order to confine him on a habeas corpus: he was brought before the chief justice, and made his defence. Chief justice, said he, though you are blind, in a certain meaning of the term, yet I flatter myself, you can see pretty plainly into this matter. It does not follow that because a man is deficient in one sense, he is destitute of another. On the contrary it is well known by observers of human nature, that where one sense is denied, the remaining become stronger. Even where an arm or a limb is lost, of the human body, the arm or the limb which remains, acquires an increase of power as if to supply the want. Would Tiresias have ever passed for a prophet if he had not wanted outward sight; or would Meonides, have written his rhapsodies, or Milton his divine poem? So much the rather thou celestial light shine inward, and the mind through all her powers irradiate; there plant eyes; all mist from thence, purge and disperse. Not that I suppose that a man has equal advantage in describing an object, who has never seen it, but takes his impressions from the description of others. For it must be rare, if a thing at all in nature, that a man can be a poet who is born blind; but having lived to a considerable age with his eye-sight, and received all the images of things upon his mind, from the originals themselves, it may be possible for him; nay it may be with advantage over others, that he can recollect these, and become more familiar with them in a reflex view, than if he was disturbed with the images themselves renewed from without. Certain it is that a man can think more deeply and closely, with his eyes shut, than if he opened them on surrounding objects. Darkness and silence are favourable to contemplation. Philosopher, said the chief justice, you do not seem to be a plain man in regard to thinking closely. You wander from the point. You are to be informed that you have been taken into the keeping of the law, not as a bad man, but as one standing in need of a protector, conceiving you under the calamity of being a little deranged in your nervous system, from a fever possibly, or some cause, which constitutes a malady, not a crime. The enquiry is whether you are in your right mind; a suspicion to the contrary of which is excited by your congregating cattle and wild beasts, in order as you say, to civilize them, and make them members of society. Experiments of this kind have with great difficulty succeeded with the savages. And indeed, where they have succeeded, it has been chiefly to the southward, where the system is more relaxed, and the temper mild. It appears madness in the abstract, to talk of humanizing brutes, that are behind savages, and at a great interval. That I deny, said the philosopher. Haud magno, intervallo—said the latin schoolmaster. I say that many of the human species are not before the brutal. “Man differs more from man than man from beast.” These things are figuratively spoken, said the chief justice. In poetry or prose, the meaning is no more than that a portion of our species, have so far degraded themselves by obedience to the sensual appetite, that like beasts they lose the face erect to heaven, and constantly looking down upon their tables, without mental enjoyment; or, that from a neglect of the cultivation of moral reason, they may seem to want but the horn or the hoof, to be like the cattle that graze the commons. This is no more than the sentiment of Plato, which with the expression in which it is clothed, is given by Longinus, as an example of the sublime. I am not just so far lost to reason, said the philososopher, as to take figures for realities. I know that a figure is but a short simile; or fable hit off in a few words; and that orators, or satyrists among the poets, or philosophers in their moral essays, by their burstings and castings, mean no more than to dissect insignificance or degradation, or sensual indulgence. It is not their intention to communicate the idea that men actually become quadrupeds; though I have seen some not far from it. But still this does not affect the question, how far the nature of beasts may be improvable. But admitting the absurdity of the attempt, and that it carries with it a presumption of derangement of the brain, is the insanity prejudicial to the community? It can be but time thrown away, which supposing me a man beside myself cannot be of great value. I purchase all my stock that I employ my pains upon, with the exception of a few that have been bestowed to me. I had a present made me of an elk from the mountains. This I am forming for an ambassador, for which if he does not turn out fit, he can be disposed of to a museum. Why should it be thought impossible to instruct the four-footed creatures, and render them capable of suffrage, if not of office? I have a great deal of trouble with them in my school, it is true, for they are apt to play truant. A young fox broke off the other day, and I have not been able to recover him. The discipline which I find it necessary to enforce is not the mildest. I use a pretty rude ferule; and I have occasion to exert authority, to quicken parts and application. If I succeed, in bringing these sans culottes to be good citizens, I shall have deserved well of the republic; and if I should fail, no one's labour is lost but my own. Experiments in every other way are indulged; and even patents granted, where the invention has but the appearance of succeeding. Why may I not be allowed to turn my attention to the making a justice of the peace out of an elk, or a judge out of a buffaloe, if the thing is possible? Especially, as instead of making a demand for my production, if I should be so fortunate as to be able to furnish these out of my manufactory, it will cost the state nothing for the education, and as to the officers themselves, the forage will be less expensive; in some cases a few tufts; in others, a little grain will suffice. If a horse-judge is invited to dine, a peck of oats, of grass or corn, and a bundle of hay in the stable and truss of straw to litter him at night, will be all that will be wanted. This will be a great saving to poor rogues that may wish to have it said that a judge dined with them; not that they care for the judge, but that people may think they have the law on their side. I say that hospitality in this way, will be less expensive, and economy, if not a moral, is at least a political virtue. But independent of these contingent advantages and barely possible, if you please, advantages, the money circulated in the settlement by this instruction; or a college of any kind which cannot but bring money, must increase the value of property. This last argument was popular, and struck the croud, de circumstantibus. Several counsel present, as friends of the court put in a word, catching at popularity, and gave their opinions that they knew of no statute in the case; and that, by the common law, every man had a right to traffic in such purchases; and that no enquiry could reasonably be made when a man bought a pig, whether he meant to make a scholar of him, or a barbecue. The chief justice inclined to be of the same opinion, and the prisoner was enlarged. CHAPTER XIV. IT is a melancholy consideration to consider how nearly the brutal nature borders on the human; because it leads to a reflection that the difference may be in degree, not in kind. But on the most diligent consideration that I have been able to give the subject, it would seem to me, that no reasonable doubt can exist of there being a distinction in kind. The brutal creation is not improvable beyond a certain limit; and that limit is reached at an early period, without pains taken to inform. The mind of a beast grows up to its size as naturally as its body. And though the capacity of a man of a very heavy nature may seem not a great deal beyond that of a sagacious quadruped of some species; yet it is capable of continual enlargement; and, at the latest years of his life, until perfect superanuation, is susceptible of new impressions. If the strength of judgment in comparing objects, cannot be improved; yet the sphere of thinking can be extended. His ideas can be infinitely increased What carries with it the appearance of virtue, in a faithful quadruped, seems to be the feeling of its nature, and not the result of any reflex sentiment of duty and obligation. Except certain noises, peculiar to their natures, and of which all of the species are possessed, as soon as they receive existence, and which is an untaught language, we have no evidence of ideas in their minds annexed to sounds. Much less is there a capacity of a variation of articulation to any extent, worth mentioning. A traveller of good sense, who has seen the Cafrarian; or whatever other species, under the denomination of the creature man, at the lowest grade, would not despair if it was imposed on him as a condition to reserve himself from slavery or death, that he must take a young person from amongst that people, and teach it any language, or science, or abstract principle of knowledge; but if it was made the condition that he should take the seemingly most intelligent of the quadrupeds of the countries he has visited, and teach any thing like what is called a rational acquisition, he would say the attempt is not worth Vol. IV. F making, it is impossible. The seven wise masters or mistresses of Greece, alluding to a popular book under that title; the philosophers of antiquity, or of modern times, employed for an indefinite space, would never teach him more in reality than he possessed in the woods from whence he came. He might be taught to connect certain movements of the body with those shewn him; and by imitation led to make them, under fear of a whip, but that is all. It is humiliating to think that brutes of whose post-existence we have no hope, have even so near an approach to our natures.— But it is consolatory that there seems to be something like demonstration that they are so far behind: that it is not in degree of intellect, but in kind, that they differ; and that that difference is so immense, that it is not unreasonable to entertain the idea of a totally different destination This is reasoning from the laws of nature as to the destination of the human mind, and on which the philosopher must dwell with pleasure, as aiding what those who believe in revelation adduce as the grounds of their faith. For there can be no philosopher, who, whatever doubts he may have of religion, can be without a wish that it may be true. What is it more than being certain of what, even supposing it not to be revealed, yet the imagination of a man would contrive for himself as painting his glory, and his happiness? What is that which we call revelation, but a system of ideas representing a prospect ennobling to our natures; and which, if not revealed, must at least be the conception of great and good minds intent on what would constitute the grandeur and felicity of the creature man. We have no means of getting at the exercise of the mind of a beast; so that we cannot say what may be the limit of their cogitations. But no one observing them has ever been able to trace any thing like an idea of what they have been; or a fear of what they may be. No uneasiness of mind seems to hang upon them from this source. Yet this anxiety is given so strong to our nature that it is the constant subject of our thoughts: our reasonings concerning it are infinite; our aerial castles which we build, even where they are the mere effect of imagination, are without end. We people all nature with beings for ourselves, even where we are not. What might have been the agonies anterior to the time of Moses, in Egypt, and other parts of Africa, we cannot ascertain; but from the history of the Jews, we have considerable information relative to that of Syria; at least of Palestine, the part of Syria, more immediately adjoining. The heathen mythology, particularly so denominated, presents an immense scope; and which, with the poets, is yet preserved. It is a part of a learned, or even of a polite education, to be made acquainted with this system in order to understand the allusion of the fine writers ancient and modern. What an immense exercise, and employment of the human mind must it not have been to build up such a system. However false we may suppose this peopleing with celestial powers, or earthly divinities, it cannot but be consolatory to reflect that it makes a boundary at all times distinct, between the human mind, however in darkness, and that of what we consider the mere animal creation. We have but partial and obscure information of the systems of other nations, contemporary with the Greeks and Romans. But we see in what we have of these, the like evidence of activity, pressing beyond the bounds of what we see before our eyes, and fashioning to our minds images of existence. The nature of these, is usually a proof of the duration and refinement of a people. Where the imagination was limited by the doctrines of revelation under the Mosaic, or Christian dispensation; as to the unity of the deity, and ministers of good or evil to man, how unlimited have been the excursions of the fancy, and the subtleties of the intellect, in the subdivisions of credence. The Talmud and the Targum of the Jews present us an immense field. The polemic divinity of the christian schools, is more within our knowledge; taught in some section of the church, to the catechumeni or propounded, in the pulpits. These disquisitions shew the wonderfully metaphysical nature of the human mind. On the contrary, there seems to be no trace of hope or fear, with regard to futurity, in the mind of a brute. I have observed with great attention, and I could never discover any symptom, in the smallest degree, of that horror which is felt by man at the view of a dead body. This horror arises from the ideas associated with the view, that it is the remains of a man. The revulsion of mind which is felt at being in the dark, especially with a dead body, seems not in the most distant degree, participated with any of the hairy or feathered tribes, neither in respect of dead creatures of their own species, or of the human. No shyness of a church yard, has ever been remarked. Tales of apparitions, are told in the hearing of domesticated animals, without the least symptom of that fear of being left alone which afflict families where there are nurses, whose memories are stored with relations of this nature. Memoirs of the Fairy kingdom, have no effect upon a dog, or a cat. But where is the heaviest of the creature called human, that is not affected? Nay, perhaps, liable to be affected the most. There would, therefore, even from this small ground of argument, be reason to infer that whatever may be said, in figures of speech, or however really man may degrade himself; yet, in the scale of being, the lowest is by an infinite distance in his nature, above a beast. That gregarious animals are susceptible of a kind of civil government, is certain. But their regulations seem to be a law of their nature; at all times the same; without changes in any country, or at any period. I do not remark this, as refuting the reveries of the visionary philosopher, but as going in deduction to the establishment of the above position. As to the philosopher, I have dwelt long enough upon his reverie, which I thought might amuse young persons, and I omit what further occurred, the contrivance of Harum Scarum, and Will Watlin, to confirm him in his hypothesis. This was to dress themselves in hair and bear skins, and to pass with him by running upon all fours, for educated cubs that had been taught languages. These were frolics of which the governor did not approve; for it is not becoming to be amused at the expense of persons deprived either of the gifts of reason, or of the goods of fortune.— It might not perhaps be blameable to be diverted at the mistake of some weak people, who were imposed upon, and became alarmed at the idea of their being candidates for the legislature, at the next election, and sent forward to take a seat. This was what the wags threatened in their disguise; and when the caprice of suffrage was considered, who could tell but that the apparent quadrupeds might make good what they spoke. CHAPTER XV. IT had struck ingenious persons that the popular opinion of beasts speaking, and being taught to speak, might be turned to some account. Hence it was that two young men with a cart, from New England, coming through the settlement, and vending tin-wares, or exchanging them for other articles, in order to sell again at a profit, projected the idea, of inveigling some rustic simpleton, and dressing him in the skin of a wild beast, put him in the vehicle, and pass him for a speaking Panther, or cat of the mountain; or what else they might think most likely to take with the multitude. Accordingly being in quest of some straggling individual, they got sight of the bog-trotter, and dogging him to a hayloft, into which he had crept to take a nap, they cast a noose about his neck, and dragging him to their receptacle, put him in their cage. A panther's skin which seemed to accord with the colour of his hair, was thought a suitable disguise with which to invest him; and this they had at hand, having in the course of this exchange, procured it amongst other peltry, which they had in a bale on the top of their carriage. They found he could speak, but in a dialect which they did not well comprehend; nor perhaps could other people, and therefore the more suitable, as they thought, for their purpose, as having the appearance of articulation, but of a beast not yet brought to express himself with a correct idiom of any language. For these itinerant traders being from the eastward, and what are called Yankies, did not understand the vernacular of the west of Ireland, of which country Teague was. Having cased him in the panther's hide, they exhibited him as one of this species, and giving him a touch of the whip now and then, and causing him to exclaim, in the language of complaint, they proved to a demonstration, that a beast might be taught to speak. The bog-trotter, in the mean time, had been missed, and something in the nature of a hue and cry had been raised on his account. Being found in the possession of the vagrants, they were questioned on the nature of their property by the officers who had detected them; though F 2 this was not until they had had him in their custody several days, and had made money by the imposition. The detection of the fraud was unavoidable, being exhibited to so many, some of whom had been acquainted with the bog-trotter, and knew the peculiar idiom of his brogue; so that suspicion first arising of the kidnapping, it came to certainty by the investigation. The robbers, as they might be called, were apprehended by a warrant from the chief justice, and brought before him. The attorney general, Harum Scarum, was very warm on the occasion and disposed to prosecute them, though not being well skilled in the law, he could not well tell for what; or in what shape to send up the indictment; whether for larceny, or burglary, or arson. But he gave the act and deed, many hard names, which he had heard of in the law. The chief justice thought it but a trespass, in legal contemplation, though of a very aggravated nature, and could not but lay a ground for an action of damages. Young men, said he, you are from a country of steady habits; but these are not the habits in which it behooves to be steady. I have heard much of the religion, or rather hypocrisy, of your country. They tell me you chuse a chaplain when you go to steal a pig, for a thanksgiving day; or plot against the government. Not that I undertake to censure your stealing a pig, provided it is for a religious purpose; because it is amongst yourselves, and these are matters with which those that are without may not have a right to meddle. But your stealing a man from himself, and from the community to whom he may be useful, though, in law, it may not come under the denomination of stealing, under all circumstances, and where it is not to take him out of the country, yet is at least a very aggravated trespass, and in what is called a civil action, may subject to very high damages. And this, I say not as anticipating the trial of the cause, if a suit should be brought, but with a view to a compromise. You are not aware of the injury to the individual which must depend somewhat upon the dignity of the person trespassed on; and the injured in this case, is no less a person than one who has been a candidate for a seat in congress, and might have been a successful candidate, had he submitted to the canvass in his favour for that delegation. But he has been actually in the capacity of a judge, and sat upon a bench. It is not long since, that the people of this country would have made him a major general, but for his own modesty that declined it, which I could wish others had done, who had, perhaps, less brain to be shot away by a cannon ball. It is alleged that he was wrought upon by his fears in declining the commission, as it might subject him to greater danger, with his uniform and his epaulets in an engagement Riflemen, or what the Europeans denominate sharp shooters, might take him off when he came to reconnoitre, or was discovered in the advance of an engagement But what is it, whether fear or modesty led him to decline the honour, so it is that he was thought worthy of the command, if the governor had thought proper to give him the commission, or he could have reconciled it to himself to have accepted of it. I mention these things, not as approving the making bog-trotters generals, or advancing them merely because a chance circumstance has given them the eclat of fortune. For in war fortune avails much. Nor do I undervalue natural talents; for I can suppose a man drawing a plough, with his gears on, and to have his traces cut, and turned loose in a command, and far surpassing in the talents of a commander, another who has had all the science and all the experience that military schools and campaigns can give. But a presumption of abilities cannot but arise from education, and experience. There is something like certainty in the one, there is but accident in the other. But dropping this, I return to your misdemeanor; not what the law calls a misdemeanor; for that is a crime, and this at least borders on a crime; but unquestionably as respects the community, you have been guilty of a great indecorum. I admit, you would not think it an offence, or at least a great offence, in your land of steady habits, where the second table of the law has been almost struck out of the decalogue, and the ceremonies of religion, and observances of these, have taken place of justice to man. It would be of less consequence, if you cheated a little in the way of your trumpery that you vend, or exchange through the country. But to purloin a valuable member of society, even if you did not mean eventually to detain him, is a transgression not easily reconcilable to a pure conscience and a good mind. But it is a maxim of the law, as well as of the gospel, or rather the law has derived it from the gospel, “talk with thine adversary whilst thou art in the way with him.” This is the foundation of our imparlances in the law, or the time given to speak with; so that as there is a tavern, or what is called an ordinary there, not far off, I would recommend it to you, young men, to take the bog-trotter aside, and, after eating and drinking together, you might perhaps come to terms. Agreeable to the hint given, the young men took the bog-trotter away to the public house, in his panther's habit as he was, and the presumption is, that a compromise did take place; for, in the language of law writs, there was no more clamour heard on that head for defect of justice. The like finesse, but in a different way, though with the same view of making money out of the phrenzy of the country, was practised; a couple of speculating men, the one in the dress of a man, the other in the costume of a beast. For it had been agreed that the one should personate a publican, or inn-keeper, the other, who was the smaller man, should pass for the bar-keeper; and, to disguise the human form, he was invested with the skin of a wild cat. The tail had remained appended to it, and as the physiognomy of a cat somewhat approaches to that of a man, the skin drawn over the features, with the same orifice for mouth and eyes, unless to a very nice examination, there was no difference. The multitude of those that came to see the hotel, would not admit of the possibility of a metamorphose, but insisted that the barkeeper was a real cat of the mountain. The faculty of speech, which it evidently had, made it the more interesting. For, as to having speech, there was no doubt; it spoke several languages, German and low Dutch, French and English. But whether it was a real beast or not, was the question. If it was a beast, and could speak, all admitted that the problem was solved, and it no longer remained an hypothesis, that there were beasts who spoke naturally, or that they could be brought to speak. There were amongst the incredulous, doubtless, some men of understanding and sagacity, and who reasoned from the laws of nature, and the analogy of the parts, there being no organs of speech to a brute creature; but abstract reasoning was borne down, by the testimony of the fact, the majority affirming, and actually believing, that it was a cat, and nevertheless was endued with the faculty of articulate speech. The inn-keeper, who affected to be a person of veracity, averred that he had known him when he was first brought from the mountains, an active skipping cat, without the smallest cultivation, or capacity of articulating a syllable, save in its own mother tongue, and a kind of mew that cats have; but that in the course of three years that he had had him as a waiter in France, Holland, Germany, and England, he had acquired sufficient of the languages of those countries to converse, or at least to understand sounds, and answer calls in German, French, &amp;c. There was not a word of truth in all this, I mean in the bar-keeper having been a cat, any more than a turkey-buzzard, but the whole a fiction of the man who passed for land-lord, acquiesced in, and sanctioned by him who passed for bar-keeper, and this to their mutual interest, and by their joint contrivance. And, nevertheless, it was as firmly believed for a considerable length of time as Redheiffer's perpetual motion, a thing not less against the laws of nature, than even the speech of beasts. As in the case of Redheiffer, so also here, the press was, in some instances, on the side of the credulous, and there was at least one editor who menaced all the invectives of his journal against any one who should presume to express a doubt of the fact. All that existed short of Redheiffer's case, was the appointment of a committee by the legislature, to ascertain and make report. Even at this day, when the bubble has burst there are those who will excuse their belief, by saying that if the little bar-keeper was not a cat, he was at least as nimble as a cat. So that if they cannot get him to be what they had taken him to be, they will have him something that resembles it. When the Governor came to interrogate Teague as to the treatment he had received in the tin cart, and the manner in which he had been apprehended, and put in it.— He gave the following account. By de holy faders, said he, I was tired trotting about de country, and just tought dat I would turn in, and slape a wink in a hay loft, when dese spalpeens, de one wid a shilelah, and de oder wid a whip, told me I was a wild baste dat could spake. I said, de devil a bit o' me was a wild baste more dan deir honours, but an honest Irishman from de county Drogheda. Wid dat one knocked me down, and de oder gave me a cut wid de whip, and marched me into dat cart yonder, and kept me dere two days, and made me spake to de paple, as if I was de panther dat had been skinned, but not to tell dat I was de bog-trotter; treatning to shoot me dead if I should own dat I was de governor's sharvant. I had de devil's own time, bad luck to dem, wid deir raw mate dey trew into my cage, save once or twice a dumplin, to shew de paple dat I would ate like a Christian baste; which I had learned, at de same time dat I was taught to spake wid my tongue, as dey said. I could spake wid de tear in my eye, but de devil a word I dared to say; or to tell fat I was, more dan dif I had a potatoe in my mouth. De big fellow o' de two would order me out of de cage, to shew de paple dat I could stand on my hind feet, and dance like a human crature, as well as spake something. But we made all up wid a good treat, as de old gentleman, de chief justice, his honour recommended; and if dat had not been in de way, I would have broke deir heads for dem, widout more compassion dan I would a snake or a tarrapin. The governor recommended him to be cautious of going into barns or hay lofts, or rambling far, as this was a new country, and the times were troublesome. It could not be anticipated, what it might be put into the peoples' heads to do with him, or with any one else, or what projectors, or itinerant speculators might set on foot next. It had been by great good fortune that he had been discovered, and rescued from these Yankies before they had got him off to their own country, whence they might have taken him to England, and shewn him to old John Bull. CHAPTER XVI. A VOTE in a community in proportion to the stake, would seem at first sight reasonable. But what is the stake? The foot of earth that one holds merely? Can soil be valued by the foot, without regard to quality, and situation? Is the improvement made upon it to pass for nothing? Quantity, and quality of soil cannot be the measure. Labour expended may be more than quantity, or quality. The adscripti glebis, or attachment to the soil, may give some security against external enemies; but what security for internal peace, and equal liberty? On the contrary, he that has much will covet more, until an aristocracy is established; and aristocracy leads to monarchy, and tyranny. Put it on the footing of desert— Does the accumulation of riches imply virtuous action? Must he be considered to be possessed of a great mind who has been fortunate? Is it not oftener evidence of a low mind to have acquired riches? I say oftener, because I admit that it is not a general rule. Has the dictum of philosophers passed for truth, that there is nothing great to despise which is great; and shall wealth in a commonwealth be accounted great, and entitling to honour and immunities? But the presumption is, that a man regardless of his own means will not be likely to adopt wise measures in affairs of the republic. I will admit that a presumption lies against him who has no property, that he might have had it, if he had been industrious, or prudent. But the moralist truly says that “riches are not to men of understanding.” That is not always so. I lay it down in general, that a moderate degree of wealth is “to men of understanding.” But there are exceptions that defy chance and time. A special providence, or chance, if you would chuse to have it so, has something to do in the affairs of men. “He that is born to the plack will never win to the babee,” is a proverb in the old Saxon language. But I hold it that in general the fact is that “the hand of the diligent maketh rich.” And a man that is faithful in his own affairs, affords a reasonable presumption, that he will be faithful in the affairs of the public. But selfishness, and disregard of the public is a symptom of a groveling mind. And there are heroic souls, that seem born not for themselves but for the public. And there is a Latin maxim, “non nobis metipsis, nascimur;” we are not born for ourselves alone. There was a poor man, and yet that “poor man saved the city.” You cannot exclude the unestated man without at the same time excluding the wise and the virtuous that are without estates. There can be no good enjoyed without an alloy of evil. Liberty of the tongue, liberty of the press, or any other species of liberty and equality will have its drawbacks. It is doubtless a great evil that Tag-rag and Bob-tail, and who are so by their own indolence, should come to the polls with an equal voice, in the constitution of the government, with those who have a greater stake in matters of property; but it cannot be avoided without losing the principle that money is not virtue. If you carry it out that property must be represented according to property, the voter must have votes in proportion as he is wealthy; and wealth in soil only cannot be regarded. The establishment of manufactures, the encouragement of commerce, would oppose this. If he that is without property of any kind can have no vote, he that has much must have many; and this brings it to an inequality of votes, which require a continual census to regulate the number. If paying tax is a criterion, he that pays more tax, ought to have more votes. I see nothing simple, and like truth in the matter, and approaching the practicable, but that the poll should poll; and every one that brings a snout of full age, to the election ground, should have a vote. Indigence is in its nature dependent; and will rally round candidates of some standing in society from their degree of independence; and the votes being thus amalgamated, will balance parties in a commonwealth. A government of liberty is the most delicate of all structures, and there is no preserving it, if the love of money is encouraged, and made the sole evidence of patriotism. If a difference in suffrage could be made, I would make it in favour of those who have invented useful arts, and made discoveries in mechanics; or who have in fact in some way benefited society. There would seem nothing unreasonable in the indulging him with privileges who had brought up a large family of children; or introduced a new breed of cattle; or grown a better sort of grass. But a usurer, or one enjoying rents from the lands that his ancestor has left him, cannot be said to deserve well of his country; or at least not so much. The New-England man that comes with his machine, for which he has obtained a patent, is of peculiar respectability compared with these. I say New-England, because that part of the United States has been most fruitful in inventions, from Phips, of Massachusetts, who invented the diving bell, down to the present time. Whether it is that poverty has produced the necessity of recurring to their wits, having a greater stock of population, and the means of livelihood being less within their reach—Ingenii largitor venter; or whether it is in the soil, or the air, and water of the climate; for natural, as well as moral causes may produce this difference in the capacities of men. I can see no reason in giving a field a vote, much less a piece of woodland; nor one to the owner of beasts in proportion to his stock; unless those beasts could speak and give a viva voce vote. It has seemed to me that the ancients, and some of the moderns, have carried the fiction beyond all probability, of beasts speaking; because a dialogue of this kind exists but in books of fables. It is much more within bounds, to put at least for one of the speakers, a person that can speak. This we have done, and have not put a single syllable into the mouth of a beast at all. It is the man that we make speak; the beast only listens. Yet it is ten to one but some will call out against the going even so far, as to represent beasts listening; because it is to music only, that they have heretofore been made to listen, and not to the dry precepts of didactic art, or moral reason. But certainly the introducing men speaking, and beasts listening, is not so extravagant, as beasts speaking, and men listening. The instances of beasts actually speaking are so few; in fact there is not a single instance within my knowledge, so that I thought it the more prudent part, in order to avoid the having the truth of my history called in question, to confine them to listening altogether. What these beasts would have said, had they spoken, every man may imagine Vol. IV. G for himself. In this case there is the less danger of giving offence, every one having it in his power, to mould his sentiments, a son gre, or according to his own mind. But had I been so inclined, how could I have made them speak? For just as they were going to open a mouth, or at least as the occasion had arrived when it would have been proper to have done it, the dogs were set upon them, or the dogs did set upon them. For this would appear to be the safer expression, as the bar assert that they as a profession, whatever some individuals might have done, had nothing to do with it. It has been stated that the proper articulately speaking beasts have not been pitched upon. It is sufficient to answer to this, that we had not the chusing them; or, if we had, can it be said that all beasts are not equally made to speak; that is, are represented equally capable of speaking in the history of Reynard the fox? Among the Jews, the ass seems to have been the principal speaker; and though an ass at the bar, or on the bench either, would be no new thing; yet vulgar opinion is against it; and if an ass had been introduced, the force of prejudice is such that any disappointment that might have occurred, would have been attributed to the choice made. Amongst the Romans, the feathered creation seem to have been the most loquacious, as they are to this day, in their own way. “Annosa ab ilice cornix.” But a prejudice also exists in modern times against fowls articulating: they are said to chatter; as for instance the magpie. Ornithologists are not so attentive as they ought to be to the language of birds. The plumage seems to be most their object in delineation; and it must be acknowledged, that it is in the article of fine feathers, like some fine ladies that I have known, that they are most distinguished; red, green, blue, vermilion, and all the colours of the rain-bow. It is in this point of view that I take the liberty of recommending the Ornithology of Wilson, lately published in Philadelphia,* * It must appear that this had been written years ago. with fine drawings of our American birds: and which every man that can afford it, ought to encourage by his subscription. Not that he makes them say any thing, ore humano; but he gives a clear and full note of their notes, under the figure of each bird; this though perhaps not so useful, is at least as amusing, as a dissertation shewing to which of the articulations of the human species, they approach nearest in their respective sounds: Arabic, Samaritan, Shawanese, or Creek. The language of beasts and birds has been much studied by the Orientalists; but none of them have given us a vocabulary, much less a dictionary, of any of those multitudinous dialects which exist amongst them. And yet in their tales of the geni, and other compilations, we have abundance of the conversation of the inhabitants of the air; which proves that the people of the east must be a good deal in the habit of hearing birds converse. The story of Mahomet's pigeons, I take to be a fiction of the monkish writers; but we have in the scripture, if it is not a figure, and a strong way of expressing what is meant, “Curse not the thing; no, not in thy thought, and curse not the rich in thy bed-chambers, for a bird of the air shall carry the voice; and that which hath wings, shall tell the matter.” Hence the language of mothers to their children, when they mean to say that they have got the information from a source they do not mean to explain, “a little bird told me of it.” It will be said that in all this ribaldry of beasts and birds speaking, I have it in view to burlesque lawyers: not at all; it is to burlesque their defects; and under the guise of allegory to slur a truth; for an able counsellor, an advocate of a good head, and heart, of which I know many, are with me amongst the first of characters. I have no such vulgar prejudice against lawyers, as some people have; there are good and bad of them as of other professions. And this I will say, that of all professions, it cannot be but that the study and practice of the law, leads most to discern the value of honesty; for the study consists in tracing the rules of justice, and the practice in the application of them. It is the man that is no lawyer, but calls himself so, that is the knave. The nature of law is liberal; and gives understanding; and wherever there is sound sense, there will be honesty. But I have such a contempt of chattering in speech, and blustering, and bullying in manners; and of quibbling, and catching in practice where it occurs, that I feel no compunction in designating it under the masque of irrational noises, or quadrupedal affections. If any thinks the cap will fit him, let him put it on. In the mean time, I will put on my considering cap, and see what it is that I have to say in the next chapter. CHAPTER XVII. IT is abundantly evident from the history of the human mind, that the more extravagant any opinion is, it is the more likely to prevail in some times and places. This will have been found to be the fact in many theories of philosophy, or systems of religion. Were there two such presented to me upon any subject which comes within the province of imagination; the one rational and moderate, the other absurd; and I was to take which I chose with a view to the speediest propagation, and the greatest number of adherents, I would take the absurd; for what merit is there in admitting what nobody, without an effort, could dispute; and independent of this, there is a secret power in the unknown, and incredible, to arrest the fancy, and subdue the judgment. The outrageous, when first presented, shocks, and then domineers over the understanding. I would just as soon undertake to persuade the bulk of mankind, that they saw a bull in the firmament, as that two and two make four. At all events, when I had once got such a thing into their heads, as a buffalo grazing on a cloud, I would defy years to get it out again. Hence it is not to be wondered at, if the idea of the improvable nature of beasts having got into the hands of the people, all reasoning with them was at an end. The visionary man had made proselytes to such an extent, that the people insisted on an experiment, by raising some of the brute creatures at least to executive offices. The clerkship of one of the courts being vacant, great interest was made by the owner of a monkey, to have him appointed. The governor was harrassed by the application, which was at the same time so respectably supported that he could not possibly avoid the nomination. Not that even yet he had the smallest confidence in his capacity of discharging the duty; but that he might save himself from the importunity of the friends of the experiment. Accordingly, the monkey was appointed, and his commission made out in form. He had remonstrated G 2 against the solicitation, representing his persuasion of the incompetency of the animal; but it was so firmly impressed upon the public mind, that the thing deserved a trial, that he was obliged to yield. For they insisted that whatever might be the incapacity of the animal, the commission would supply the defect. Indeed they argued very plausibly upon this; and it seemed not to be without foundation that they urged, that it was every day before their eyes, that persons were appointed to office who were not qualified; and what was more, never could become qualified; and yet the world did not stand still; nor did even the order of society, and the affairs of men seem deranged. It is incredible what a little matter will go to support one in the discharge of an office. Hence it is not so absurd what the buffoon said, “let the king give me a commission, and I will see who will say I am not fit for it.” However, in the present instance, it was carrying the jest, or as it ought to be said, the experiment too far. The monkey did not make out even to save appearances for a short time; whether owing to the mismanagement of those who had the command of him, or to his own incurable restlessness, and locomotive faculty. For being brought in, and placed upon the table, with the implements of writing before him, and the docket to make entries; the first thing that struck him, was the basket of a fruiterer at some distance; and it was not a second of time before he had leaped upon it, and had a pippin in his paw. Being brought back, and put to his desk again, and desired to make a minute, he deliberately got up and made water on the table, the inkstand being in the way. This was encouraging to the sanguine; for it was thought he wished to have the ink made thinner, as being about to write. But no appearance of this, when the next bound was upon the bench, and the judge's wig hauled off his head, and pulled under the table. This was ruled a contempt of court, and pug was ordered into custody. It was with some difficulty that this was accomplished; the constable and sheriff exerting themselves to take him, but his leaps were so nimble, that it was not until after a considerable time, with the assistance of the whole bar, and the suitors of the court, that they could lay their hands upon him. In fact, it was not until some of them had laid their sticks upon him, and knocked him down, that they were able to entangle him in such a manner as to overcome his cantrips, and get him in a bag, as you would a cat, in order to convey him to prison. Who could have thought that such a practical experiment would not have reduced the falsity of the hypothesis of the improvability of beasts to the extent alleged by some, to an evident demonstration. And yet so ingenious is the pride of the mind, to support the error which it has once patronized, that some did not even yet submit to reason and common sense. They averred, a want of candour in the court and bar to have the experiment fairly made, alleging the craft of the profession; that pug could not have had fair play in the trial; that he must have been pinched in the tail, or in some other way, rendered unmanageable. For, that of himself, he never could have shown such an unwillingness to discharge the duties of the office; more especially, as by shewing him apples and nuts at a distance, it was a hint to him, what he might expect in the way of fees, provided that his capacity, and his diligence, was found to equal the hopes his friends had entertained of him. But, whether the experiment in making a monkey a prothonotary, was baffled by the utter incapacity of the animal himself, or by the intrigue of the profession, and the court frowning on it, the practicability of making more out of the brute creation, than had ever yet been done, was not wholly given up. It was determined to make an experiment of what might be done, in bringing forward some of them into the profession itself; and with a view to this, choice was made of the more noisy of the dumb creatures, a dog For though this beast comes under the denomination of dumb, yet it is no uncommon thing to compare a lawyer to him, or him to a lawyer; and though we say a dumb dog, yet I have heard a lawyer called an impudent dog; and there are many who are said to bark, rather than to argue a cause like a rational creature. The court were a good deal opposed to the admitting a hound to the bar. But the people, out of doors, and those of the circumstantibus, or bystanders, would insist upon it. The court said, they would not be understood to entertain a doubt of the capacity, in such advocates, at least so far as respected the making motions; but they were apprehensive of disorderly behaviour; not so much as to side bar conversation, and sitting on their backsides, and looking up to bark, as to their movements to and fro, and leaping upon the bench; in which case it would not be much less difficult to keep them to their places, than it had been in the case of the monkey, whom they had all seen could not be kept to order. As to the keeping to the point in their discourses, of that there was not so much matter; for it was not always easy to see what was the point that was made, and to which it became necessary to stick. Was there no danger, that instead of confining themselves to a wrangle, they would actually wage war, and interchange bites in the course of their altercations? Wager of battle did not exist as a mode of trial; and therefore fighting like dogs was not known in judicial proceedings; though the quarrels of counsel did sometimes approach a little towards it. On all these considerations, the court would have been willing to have confined the construction of the constitutution, that “a man shall be heard by himself or his counsel,” to the being heard by himself, or some animal of his own species. Nor was there any great reason to believe, that, though in many instances we see the more incompetent of a bar at the head of the business; yet in general, people will find out those who can serve them best; and it was not probable, that if the real, natural, and actual tykes were admitted to plead, any one would be so weak as to employ them in a cause; it is true, they had known many an ignorant impudent puppy at the bar; and some good natured of the dog tribe, so called by way of figure and resemblance, even make fortunes. But this was by way of figure; and they had never yet known one so perfect a beast, as to want the shape of a man, to make his way, or even to attempt practice. And if no suitor did employ such a one, when admitted, where would be his business; unless in the case of a pauper unable to defend himself, where the court might appoint counsel; which would not be decorous in them to do, even in the case of a misdemeanor, unless they had greater reason to expect something like a defence for the unfortunate accused, than from such unexpereinced persons. It is true, that such appointment by the court, as in the case of a horse-thief, that every body believed guilty, even before he was tried, might pass without censure; but if an honest pauper was convicted, being falsely accused, and this owing to the blunder of an advocate appointed by the court, the reflection would fall upon them; for these reasons they would be shy in taking such nomination upon them; and would be disposed to leave the dog, whether what is called a feiste, or a mastiff, to his own exertions to get himself employed as he could; and if it came to them to assign counsel at any time, they would select, if the younger, yet at least some of the bar more likely to do justice. It was to no purpose that these matters were urged.— For however weighty the reasons, they were of no avail against the current of public opinion; whether it was that there was some, as there was reason to suspect, wished the lawyers burlesqued, and the profession made a subject of ridicule; or that the greater part were really credulous, which is more probable, to the representation of the philosopher. Hence it was, that on the day appointed for the experiment, a great number attending, some of the most respectable of the community; two of the canine species were brought in, and placed opposite each other, as adversaries in a cause. They were said to be dogs of a good bark, and had been pitted against each other several times before the bringing them to court, and had worried each other pretty comfortably, on more occasions than one. Hence there could be no doubt, but that they would take different sides of the question, and snarl, and grin, and growl abundantly; the only difficulty would be the keeping them apart, until the testimony in a cause had been introduced, and they were directed by the court to proceed. This difficulty, as was foreseen, did actually occur; for no sooner were the beagles uncoupled, than they actually flew at each other, and had one another by the throat. It was in vain that the judge called out order, gentlemen order; I shall be under the necessity of committing you for this irregularity of proceeding; your behaviour is unbecoming the profession. The dogs continued their contest, till one knocked under, and howled most piteously. The humanity of the spectators, some of whom were suitors, and some not, at length interposed, and wished them to be separated, but not an individual of the bar gave themselves the least concern on the occasion; but on the contrary, seemed diverted with it as a farce, and laughed immoderately; which gave great offence to the people, and much reason to suspect, as in the case of the monkey, there had not been fair play in the experiment. Who could tell what spurs, or sharp weapons there might have been under the table to prick and goad these simple and unsuspecting creatures to battle? If Jowler and Cesar had actually succeeded in maintaining a standing at the bar, it might materially have affected the employing human bull-dogs, to manage a controversy.— And could it be supposed, that having this interest at stake, the profession would have made no exertion, secret or reserved, to counteract the introduction of quadrupeds Upon these grounds, the persuasion of the capacity of beasts to advocate the most difficult question of law, or fact, was strengthened, rather than reduced, by the experiment made; or if some did query whether all at once, they might be competent to give the best advice, as chamber counsel in a matter of difficulty respecting the legal tenure of estates; yet no one hesitated to pronounce his conviction that they were capable of being good advocates, in a criminal case of assault and battery at least; or where noise and racket went a great way to constitute a good pleader. The public opinion out of doors, was formed a good deal upon the noise they had heard. It was thought to resemble that of lawyers in their sparring. If some surmise did get out, that in nothing but yelping did they resemble, it was attributed to their not being of the genuine breed, that was fit for the bar; that experiment ought to be made from the Norwegian lap dog, to the little Indian dog of the South sea, until they came to one that had the right genuine snarl. But all idea of incapacity was hooted at by others, who had taken up a more favourable impression, having been in the way of hearing that one of them made a speech of an hour in length; and that, had he not been stopped by the court, he would have spoken two hours. What did he say? said a man somewhat incredulous. I never can tell very well, said the other, what the lawyers say. It is all the same sort of jargon to me, consisting of law terms; but this I know, if I had a cause to try, I would leave it as soon to the dog that I heard bark, as to most lawyers that I have seen plead at a bar. Owing to these averments, and promulgation of rumours, all tending to make dog pleading popular, it was not longer than the next week, that there were several people who had come into town, enquiring where the dog lawyers had their offices. The real lawyers were so enraged that they knocked them on the head, though of the profession; but clandestinely; for they were not without apprehension of the resentment of the suitors, if the dogacide should come to light. The law might take hold of them also, if they could be considered as coming under the description of reasonable creatures in the peace of the commonwealth. But there was no need of this precaution, and secrecy; for the whole circumstance relating to the dogs, and their appearance in court, or the manner in which they acquitted themselves in the trial of a cause, was lost and forgotton in the introduction of a wolf and fox the third day of the court; the wolf muzzled, having been taken in a trap. But to avoid all insinuation, or popular obloquy, of not giving them a fair chance, by admonishing them before they began, of the duty of counsel, the rules of the court were read to them, and it was stated what abuses in the conduct of attornies, had been observed, and which it behooved them to avoid; such as scratching their noses, puffing their breath, turning and twisting in their seats, or sitting on their arses, and talking to the bench; holding side-bar conversations, and looking and yelping to the juries, or grinning when they thought they had said a great thing smart. Growling and grumbling when the point was given against them, they ought not to take it for granted, that they were the only persons who had a knowledge of the law or practice; and that their opinion of a law case, or the application, was not infallible. Gentlemen, said the chief justice, you are entering on a profession that, independent of legal knowledge, for that, we take it for granted, you have a competent share of, requires in a practitioner the utmost delicacy of behaviour, both to the bar and to the bench, as the surest means of your success. For it is a mistake to suppose, that impudence is the principal qualification here. It may go some length in the opinion of bystanders, to give them the impression of boldness; but it goes no length with the court. It is, on the contrary, a great drawback. Diligent preparation in your offices, and modest demeanour at the bar, is the most likely way to secure confidence and to conciliate attention, and to have what is called the ear of the court. For when a person merely barks, the moment he begins, nothing but a bark being expected, the judge lets his mind go to pasture, if I may be allowed a figure, that is, indulges himself in absence of mind, until the harangue wears near a close. There is what is called having the ear of the court: for should you howl ever so loud, or bark, unless there is a previous respect founded in the expectation of what you are about to say, there will be little attention in reality, whatever there may seem to be. Opinion had been expressed in the mean time, on the talents of the respective advocates, according as any one had augured favourably, or the reverse of one or the other. It was expected the fox would shew the most address in the management of a cause. But that the wolf would be most likely to carry his point by browbeating his adversary, and the court. Gentlemen, said the court, fox and wolf, or wolf and fox, whichever of you it is that begins first, and that will depend upon your being for the plantiff or defendant— you will please to proceed. The wolf being unmuzzled, and the fox let slip, the one ran under the bench, and the other leaped out at the window: the wolf it was that leaped out of the window, the dogs after him, which gave occasion to leave this matter of professional capacity still undetermined; the pursuit of the dogs giving occasion to the old surmise of the lawyers having set them upon them to get rid of a formidable rival. In the hurry scurry, there was little said about the fox, and he was supposed to have made his escape. The reprimand that the chief justice gave to the squirrels and the pigs for their behaviour in court, was perhaps the most pointed of that given to any of the beasts; to the squirrels for cracking nuts, and chirping like cockroaches, while the charge was delivering, and conversing in corners with each other. To the pigs, for munching apples; because it was not only a trespass against decorum, but an interruption to the argument of counsel, which could not be so well heard. Mouthing on the stage is spoken of as far from being agreeable. But such mouthing produces but a slight tumefaction of the oral orifice, and gives a rounding to the voice, “Ore rotundo.” But the mouthing the pippin, or the peach, distends the jaws occasionally to an immeasurable width; and if one half the hemisphere is attempted to be embraced like a snake swallowing a hare, the eyes have an appearance of starting from their sockets, which communicates pain to the beholder, because it impresses the idea that the actor is in pain. Vol. IV. H CHAPTER XVIII. WHEN I speak of the Visionary Philosopher, I do not mean him that had “Read Alexander Ross over;” but who had seen the great Stewart, who delivered lectures in this country, on the perfectibility of man, and this student, or disciple, had been disposed to carry the matter farther, and discuss the perfectibility of beasts. It is impracticable, said the Governor. Instinct has but narrow limits; and is not improvable, as is human reason. However sagacious a fox may be, in eluding hounds, and catching poultry, the distinction is immense in the nature of the intellect. I hope you would not think of extending the right of suffrage to these. There is no incorporating wild-cats and jack-daws in the community. We have enough to do with men that have the shapes of Christians, let alone, opossums, and jackalls, and bears of the forest that have no reflection; or if they could reflect, would their keepers permit that intercourse with peaceable inhabitants, as to render the interchange of civilities safe and convenient. In point of capacity they would be deficient, and unqualified even for the ministerial offices of government. But as to those duties, or professions which require some discrimination of meum, and tuum, they ever remain totally incompetent. What? said the Philosopher, persisting in his theory; have you not heard it said, that judge this, or judge that, is an ass, that another is a horse, and of even a juris consult, or barrister, for instance is a panther; a bear; especially when he is hard upon a witness in his cross examination? Might it not be practicable to bring a brute beast to be even capable of filling an office of trust or honour? I grant that a judge, figuratively, said the Governor, may be a horse, or a buffalo, or an ass; or that a counsellor may somewhat resemble the ferocity of a tyger at the bar. But that these animals, stript of all figure, and colouring of speech, should in reality, and in propria personæ, be put upon the bench, or licensed to plead, would be more than I am yet prepared to think advisable. You are not aware of the hypothesis of Darwin, said the Philosopher, that man may have been originally a cray-fish, or a flying-squirrel? I am not, said the Governor. And though I do not know that the Lord spoke all things to Moses that he is said to have spoken; for there may have been some mistakes in the translations from the Hebrew, as in other versions; yet there seems to me more probability in the cosmongony, of that Hebrew writer, than in the reveries of Darwin in his Temple of Nature, or his Zoonomia. And even supposing the brutal to be capable of amelioration from one nature to another, until it reaches the human, it would seem to me, that its rights should keep pace only with the improvement of its forms; and that we should wait until the elephant comes to sit upon his one end, and cease to go upon all fours, before we think of introducing even the noblest of animals, in point of intellect, into a participation of civil institutions. The swinish multitude, are spoken of as having a right to vote; but that also is figurative, and it is not meant that a pig can be actually admitted at the hustings to give in a ticket; much less, that a wolf, just taken in a trap, should be made a justice of the peace, or an alderman. What, said the Philosopher; has there not been a time when the beasts spoke? “Pecudesquæ locutæ,” Annosa ab illice cornix, said the Latin schoolmaster, who had just joined the conversation. It is fabulous, said the Governor. I have seen what is called the history of Reynard the Fox; and what beasts were when under the monarchy, where the lyon was king; and I think a good book might be written, called the republic of beasts, pourtraying the cabals of men, and their contentions in a free government. But to constitute a republic in reality, of the four-footed creation, would be carrying matters a step farther than has ever yet been attempted In that case, I acknowledge we would have no occasion for the common law; nor tribunals, or forms of administering justice; jury trial might be abolished; for scratching and scrambling would be the way of every one. Blackstone has a chapter, said the blind Lawyer, “on the redress of private wrongs, by the mere act of the parties.” That would make shorter work than even an arbitration, said a bystander. But, said the Governor, to speak seriously, though it may give a wise man indignation to see incapacity in office, which will always be the case in any government, and perhaps not more in a republic than in any other; nay I incline to think less so, which it behooves me to say, who am honoured with one, under that kind of constitution, yet I am opposed to the extreme of universal suffrage, to all the denizens of the forest, as some are pleased to stile them, and which phrase may have misled this philosopher to think them capable of being denizen amongst men. But if you think the experiment worth making, let a number be collected, and go into the measure with caution, and deliberation. You will see what a conflict will take place, and what a warring there will soon be. —“Mugitusque boum, Exaudire leones”— said the Latin schoolmaster. Plase your honours, said Teague O'Regan, who was listening, a shape will be de safest baste to halter first, and try in de plough o' de commonwealth. If de pretty baste can say ba, in de congress o' de nation, dey cannot say dat it is de ass dat spakes. There may be a prettier, but there cannot be a greater beast than yourself, Teague O'Regan, said some one in the crowd. And yet we have heard of you getting an office; what is more, we see you in one, not just on the bench, as in a neighbouring state, but in an office though executive. It is said, the Captain, our now Governor, who opposes the innovation of giving horned cattle a vote, proposed you for congress, and would have no objection to have seen you President of the Union. That is not the fact, said the Governor; I did object to it, but I was overruled and induced to let the experiment be made; but I never did approve of such extraordinary advancement; though were I to be guided by what I see here, I might not think the presumption so preposterous. How much better are many of you that are in office, than Teague O'Regan? The visionary Philosopher having taken wind, went on. Why need Cyrano de Berjerac have gone to the moon, said he, to see monkeys and baboons in the capacities of waiting men, if we had been supplied with domestics of that description here? And why limit our experiments to what may be made of men? The perfectibility of human nature, no one can doubt, who has heard the lectures of Stewart, the pedestrian, who was in this country some years ago. And why not the perfectibility of animals that are not human? I have heard a man called a calf, a sheep, a hog, a goose, and why not, one day, hear these called man? And to accomplish this, I would by admitting them to the elective franchise; at least all above a certain age, and who have come to the years of discretion. Years of discretion! said the Governor. Did you ever hear of a beast coming to the years of discretion? Instinct is not common sense: for common sense is that degree of understanding, that portion of intellect which is generally distributed to the human species. Where the capacity is in any way distinguished, we call it talent. But where that portion of judgment which enables to judge with reasonable correctness on common subjects is given, we call it common sense. A man may be a scholar, a lawyer, a judge; that is, may have the reputation of a scholar, and may have the commission of a judge, and yet want common sense; by which I mean sense in common things. For a knowledge of abtract rules may go some length to make a man of science; but common sense is judgment in the application of rules. It is the comparing things; and hence it is that I do not think this Philosopher, though he may surpass the magi of Babylon in a knowledge of the stars, can have common sense, in urging this matter upon a young people, just beginning a new government. What would you do with a horse upon a bench; to eat hay, and dung on it: a monkey a prothonotary, to crack nuts, and be restless: an ass to quote British precedents, and to say, my lord has said this, and my lord has said that; if indeed he could not say any thing, and not rather bray what he had to say. We have dunces enough of our breed to be doing with a while yet. Why enlarge the sphere of stupidity A pretty bar we would have of it in point of order, if elks, and panthers were admitted to conduct a cause; motions for new trials in abundance. The pertinacity of the unicorn would be unsufferable. What! said Will Watlin, a constable; have we not heard a bar called a bear guardian; interrupting one another, H 2 troublesome to the court. I should like to see a cat, and a racoon wrangle as some of these have done. The mild and the modest man has no chance. All is carried by a coup de main, which some interpret a stroke of the fist. I am not permitted to take up my staff and apply it to knock them, as I should be warranted in doing, in case of a wild boar, or a rhinocerous, I should take them across the noddle, as I would have done many a lawyer, if the rules of court permitted it. I am for enlarging the sphere of jurisprudence, said Harum Scarum; and the province of admission to bench or bar. Is any man afraid of the rivalship of turkey-buzzards? What can check the hospitality of letting all into the pale of our union? We shall have more to contend against the savages. Pro aris et focis, said the Latin schoolmaster. We shall have more to contend against the savages, continued Harum Scarum; for increase numbers in a government, and in that proportion, you render them active in support of their privileges. Men that ought to think, can learn to stand upon their heads, and to run upon all fours; and why not beasts of the wood learn to think. I dislike the having all things in a common course. Nature herself has given us the variety of seasons, and revolutions of the sun and moon, and heavenly bodies, and why not in the affairs of men; and especially in their social institutions as to representation, or exclusion. In the mean time, about a score of young persons, by climbing up into trees, to hear the debate, or to see what was going on in the centre of the meeting, were seen by the spectators, and mistaken for opossums that were turned into men already, by the bare proposition of advancing them to naturalization; and though this error was corrected in a short time by one of them who had fallen and brought intelligence of the cause of the ascension, and the mistake of the transformation; yet it but struck the notion deeper into the heads of the vulgar, of having accession from the quadrupeds at the next census of free inhabitants; and a man with a strong voice in particular called out that it should be so. A bull happening to roar, and a horse to neigh at the same time, it was called out that it was the voice of the people. In the multitude of a town meeting, or even in a whole community, it requires but a few persons stationed at convenient distances, and dispersed in due proportion, to raise a voice, and to call out in favour of a proposition, to give it currency, and acceptability. Every one fearing to be in the minority, will seize the opportunity of coming round to the majority. It is “the height of ability to distinguish the times,” says the Duke de Rochefaucault and I know no proof of discernment in a republic greater than to foresee which way the current is like to set, and to sail with it; or rather, if you can influence at all, to seize occasion by the forelock, and by disposing a few frogs in a pond to roar, make it be supposed that the public opinion is in the direction you chuse to have it. Shall a man value himself on predicting the weather, and not the changes of political events? At least this is the principle upon which the greater part of politicians act. The Governor finding that he was like to be on the unpopular side of the question, was willing to ease away, and come under the lee of the Chief Justice, who though but a blind man could see farther into the nature of the occasion, than his excellency. His opinion was to let the thing take its course, and in a short time the public would be convinced how impracticable it was to extend liberty, where nature meant that it should have limits. He thought it best to address himself to their feelings in point of interest, than to call in question, the practicability of the project. Philosopher, said he, there is no doubt, but there is truth in what you say; and your proposition might be carried into effect, with suitable restrictions. But if we should admit the beasts to the rights of citizenship, we should have set them free as we done the negroes. The very right of suffrage would be a manumission; and it would be unreasonable to extend the privilege to such as are of feræ naturæ, and exclude tame beasts. Now if cattle of oxen, and horses become entitled to equal privileges we could not treat them as beasts of burden, or use them for the draught; much less could we knock down a pig, or shoot a deer, or take the skin off a bear; not even ride a horse, but on condition of taking turns, and letting him sometimes ride us. Who of you would be hitched in a sled, or stand at the tongue of a wagon for a whole night champing cut straw, and rye meal, or bear the whip of the carter in the day time? Who would be ringed and yoked like a pig, to keep you from getting through a fence? These observations, however ridiculous, had more effect in quelling the commotion, than any direct reasoning because whatever crosses the thought, and gives a different direction to the imagination, has been known to be most effectual in relieving a derangement of the mind. CHAPTER XIX. A CONSTITUTION had been adopted and laws about to be made, when Teague O`Regan at the head of a number of his countrymen, began to make a disturbance. Assembling in groups and calling out for more liberty. It was thought advisable, this Jack Cade, being his own bog-trotter, that the governor should address them, and bring them to reason. Mounting a stump where they were assembled in an old field, he addressed them accordingly. Sons of St. Patrick, said he, you appear to me like draught cattle that are put into the plough or harnessed in a team and striving to throw off your tackle. Can you draw without gears? Is not some confinement necessary to enable you to draw together? A joint force cannot be applied without some means of coupleing you. You have as much liberty as you are capable of enjoying. Teague in particular cannot endure more; I say a little less would do him good. [At this time a noise was heard of some one singing Erin go bra;] it is a good tune said the governor; and I admire it more than Britannia rules the waves. For I always thought that a very impudent chorus. It is sufficient to excite the indignation of nations, to avow despotism of the seas, in so barefaced a manner. Not but that I think we are under French influence. For do we not see in these states French emigrants teaching French, and can there be a liking to the French without some predilection for the people. We have imitated the manners of the St. Domingo people because they speak French, and the dress of our females is improved as some think by borrowing from them the Grecian stole, with the cincture of Venus, which is thought in a warm climate to give more grace to the shape, than the short jacket and the hoop of old maidens formerly, by which the form was cut into two, nearly in the middle, like those we call insects in the history of animals. But that French influence prevails no one can doubt, who will reconsider the history of these states. There is reason to believe that the French were at the very bottom of our revolution. I will take the liberty of stopping a little at this point of the game to express a few thoughts that come into my mind, though it may be esteemed a digression. I observe that some of you come to breakfast with your beards on in the morning. It is because you are waiting for the barber: but why not shave yourselves? I would have you learn this oeconomy even were it at the expense of some blood drawn. How can you be independent unless you can do this within yourselves, the taking off your beards. You talk of reforming the government, and you leave undone the reforming yourselves. I can excuse curriers who have to clean horses in the morning, but those that have to take care but of themselves, to be coming to breakfast with their visages untrimmed, is ungraceful. The first thing to be done in the morning, is to shave, wash and dress for the day. The savages greese themselves to save from the damp earth, and to guard against the rheumatism, as well as to amuse the flies; and the people of this new settlement who are bordering on savages, may be indulged in a little resemblance; but clerks of an office, or young lawyers, subject the delicacy of their minds to be called in question, to be shuffling about in their hippen in the morning, with their hair in disorder, and their hands, begrimmed, and their faces black. Nor is it in your persons that you are deficient in attention. How much more comfortable might you make your habitations by little more judgment in the construction of them. The nearer the water you build, you save toil in carrying from thence, but the ground is low, and you subject yourselves to colds, whereas the higher ground, at the expense of a little more labour, would preserve health; lasiness is visible in all your vestiges. There are many inches and bits of days which you lose, because it is like for rain; and a thousand small matters are neglected, which might be done at these shreds and patches of employment. All this you overlook less considerate than the fowls who make their nests on the trees around. Yet you are sharp-sighted in the affairs of government; you abuse governors; you attack judges. Were I at the head of a paper I would turn the battery upon yourselves; I would carry the war into your own country. Your error in deracinating grubs; not keeping your mattocks sharp; wearing leather aprons when you bestride saplins, worming your fences when you might have post and rail, planting corn without cross ploughing your fields: occasioning so much labour of the hoe, and giving way to the weeds. I know but little of these things, it is true, nor do you much about the nature of constitutions and the common law. But I would charge home upon your ignorance of agriculture; and keep your minds employed in defending yourselves. Now you are dissatisfied when I call you ignoramouses, and clodpoles; just out of an anxiety to get you to take care of your interests. This harangue had some effect for the present, in stilling house, and quieting accusations, though it did not actually eradicate the cause of the dissatisfaction. For in the language of the poet. Convince a man against his will, And he's of the same opinion still. CHAPTER XX. THE preceding painting may be considered as extravagant; and exceeding all probability; the voting of beasts. But is it a new thing in the history of government that the right of suffrage should be made to depend upon property. No man shall be entitled to a vote unless he is worth so much, say some of the constitutions. In this case is it not his property that votes? If this property consists in cattle, can it be said that his cattle do not vote? Ergo, a cow or a horse, in some communities have the privilege of a vote in the enacting laws. If some of them, who belong to hard hearted masters, knew of this privilege, and could exercise it to the whole extent of their wishes, they would stipulate with the candidate, for milder treatment in the drudgery in which they are employed. I have seen many a horse, that considering matters individually; and apart from the nature, I have thought more respectable than the owner; and yet this horse most unmercifully treated. The only universally distinguishing criterion of humanity, that I know is, the mild treatment of every creature that has feeling, and is in our power. This ought to be inculcated as a moral duty. But as to beasts in propria persona, voting, not just giving in a ticket for themselves, but standing by, and neighing or grunting, or grinning. It may be thought too much yet. But why should it be thought altogether out of the compass of possibility. After what I have seen and heard of mankind, I should not wonder at such a thing taking place. Of what absurdity is not the human mind capable. Who would think it possible were it not a fact established by ten thousand testimonies, that human sacrifice could ever have been thought acceptable to the divinity? It is easy to trace the origin of the idea, and the policy of the sacrifice of cattle; because it facilitated to an order of men who did not labour, the means of livelihood. And unless we suppose that the custom of human sacrifice began amongst men that were cannibals, I am at a loss to account for it. It may be considered as still more absurd, that a creature, supposed rational, as man, could be so far irrational as to think that the punishment of himself could be acceptable to divinity, unless taken in this light, that the present smart might help weak minds to refrain from the like wrong they have done; connecting the flagellation with the memory of it. Hence it may be said, that it is not out of nature, to ascribe any thing however absurd to the creature man. The line of the poet Pope applied to an individual, may be parodied, and applied to the whole species. “The greatest, basest, meanest of all kind.” If it should be found, as I hope it will, some hundred years hence, that no innovator in a republican government, has at that time thought of extending suffrage in this manner, will he be sure that it is not owing to my ridicule that the thing has not taken place? If a chapter like this had been written in the course of the revolution from the government of Britain, representing the body of the people in some state, as reprobating the common law, and calling out for its abrogation, would it not have been thought extravagant, and intended as a burlusque upon the republican institutions of the country? And yet we have seen this actually pressed and not far from being carried. It amounts to the same thing as having no law at all. For it is experience that has made that law; dictated by the wants of man successively brought to view. And to begin again, we must be in the situation of those who had no law; and therefore the proposition was to be without law; and to have law only as a legislature, from occasion to occasion, could enact.— the case that first happened, could have no principle, that could apply to it; that must be provided for the second: and at the end of a thousand years, we might have such a body of laws, as that which is proposed to be abolished. I say we might have; but it would be a rare chance if we should: for it would require the continuance of a free government all that time to give it.— How should a man be sensible of this, that had not traced the history of that law, and examined the nature of it? It could not be expected from one who had confounded its perversions with the law itself. If when the constitutions of these states were formed, after much reflection of the ablest judges, and the people had solemnly, and deliberately adopted them, it had been stated by any writer, that in the short period, of perhaps not more than Vol. IV. I twenty years, innovators, not born in the country, or born late, and having no experience of what had past, should assume the language of what they call reform, to the extent they have done in some places, would it be believed? Nay, would it not have been rejected as outraging all probability? Suppose it had been a part of the prediction that these innovators should come, the principal of them, from the country with whom we were then at war, and these not the most intelligent of them, and that the body of our people should be wrought upon, in any degree by their representation, would it have been thought at all likely to happen? There is no knowing to what the love of novelty may bring the human mind. It is a strange compound of the rational and irrational, and it is only by turns that the rational predominates.— “Thinkest thou me a dog, that I can do these things?” said Hazael. Thinkest thou me a beast, may one say to me, that I could advocate the suffrages of beasts, or of giving them the elective franchise? Yes: human nature, I do think you capable of being brought to such absurdity, or to any thing else you please to call it. It is true, I do not see you at this moment offering up your children, or even enemies, as sacrifices to please a divinity, which out-herods Herod, in all conceptions, yet I hear doctrines published, and see them in books, which are still worse. For their divinities, with the exception of the case of Jeptha and his daughter, were the false divinities of the heathen world; and might be supposed to delight in the miseries of mortals; though what good they could get by that, I cannot comprehend. But in the doctrines which I have in view, a good deity, and even represented as good, by these blasphemers, without knowing it, is holden out as having created existences the sum of whose misery may exceed the happiness. Nay, even the escape from the excess of misery above that of happiness, may depend upon a charm. For the idea of felicity in a future state depending upon subtilties of creeds, is placing it upon the mere accident of situation and the casualty of belief. Yet if one were to deny to some doctors the truth of what they teach, they would be disposed to treat the individual as not a good citizen. It is true, they would only say, they did not think him a good citizen. But I would say to them, that I did not think them Christians at all, so far as regarded opinion, whatever they might be in practice. For the Christian religion is a system of humanity, and truth; and the great object of it is to secure morality amongst men. It has no metaphysics in the nature of it; but is intelligible to a child, though catechisms are not.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">BOOK II. CHAPTER I. “Once more to the breach, dear friends, And close up the wall with English dead.” THAT is not a humane sentiment; for though we have wrongs from England, yet I wish a war put off as long as possible.* * This was written before the war. Though I see that in the nature of things “offences will come, and wo to him by whom they come,” says the scripture. The ultima ratio regum, though the most effectual, is the hardest logic that can be introduced. But when I used the words, “Once more to the breach,” or when they came into my mind, it was as much as to say, “another whet at the ram.” This means the same thing, and is a well known allusion to the clergyman taking his text from that portion of scripture, where the ram was caught in the brake, for the sacrifice, instead of Isaac; and having preached figuratively upon it, was wont to introduce his remarks, with “Another whet at the ram.” This anecdote will be found in a book, entitled, Scotch Presbyterian Eloquence. It is a matter of great self-denial in me not to introduce more quotations from the Latin classics; but I am unwilling to incur the imputation of pedantry, which persons who do not understand the language, are apt to bestow upon those who indulge themselves in this liberty of quotation from the Roman writers. And yet to myself it is extremely pleasing; because I see great beauty in the turn of expression in that language; but still more in the Greek; though I do not quote it, because there are few printers who are furnished with Greek types, and can set the words. As to French, I am not unacquainted with it, but never have come to like the language; that is, to relish it, and to feel the delicacy of an expression perfectly, as setting off the thought. Nevertheless I am not wholly insensible of the neatness and perspicuity of the stile of some writers in that language, in preference to others, as of Voltaire, or Russeau, compared with the bulk of those who have gone before them. But of all languages that I have ever tasted, the Greek, unquestionably, with me, has the preference; and yet it cannot be supposed that I understand it as well as my vernacular; nor within many degrees of it; and yet I think it a thousand times superior. Bred in a soft air, and warm climate; whereas the English would seem to have been frozen in the north, before it began to be spoken by man; or rather it was first spoken by frozen men. Certain it is, that cold climates give a rigidity to the fibre, and harden those muscles by which the articulation is performed. Pinkerton the greatest philologist of modern times, at least that I am acquainted with, thinks that the Greek is derived from the German and that the German is the original Persian: that in some convulsion of the Persian empire, at an earlier period than we have any account of, some portion of that people had emigrated, and passing to the north, had made the circuit of the Caspian, and Euxine seas; and, at length established themselves in the heart of Europe. I can more readily conceive the Persian hardening into the harshness of the German sounds, than of the German softening into the fluidity, and sweetness of the Greek accent; but that there is a great affinity between the German, and the Greek, there is no one who understands both languages, but must admit. Both have a dual number; but independent of this, it is a proof of the affinity, that a German can easily learn to pronounce the Greek gutturals; whereas to those of most other nations, it is difficult. That the Germans used the Greek alphabet in the time of Julius Cæsar, appears from his commentaries; though some have attempted to lessen the evidence of this, by changing the words, Grecis literis, into Crassis literis utuntur; but clear it is, that a long time must have elapsed in the amelioration of the German into Greek; though I do not altogether reject the idea of these being the same language originally, as Pinkerton has endeavoured to prove, both by the authority of writers, and by an historical deduction of the I 2 origin of ancient nations. I must acknowledge that until I had read his dissertation, I had been inclined to think that the Germans had been a people distinct from all others from the creation of the world; for it is remarkable that in the time of Julius Cæsar, before any mixture of other nations had intervened, the colour of the eye, and the hair of all, were the same; the blue eye, and the yellow hair— Cærula quis stupuit, Germani lumina, flavam Cæsariem— — This quotation is from Juvenal, who puts this national characteristic of feature, upon the same footing as to being common with the swelling of the neck in Switzerland. Quis tumidum guttur miratur sub alpibus. Which swelling, called the goitre, is not confined to the Alps; but is found at the foot of most high mountains: at those of Thibet in Tartary, as well as of the Allegheny mountains, on the west side: for it is remarkable that no instance occurs on the east. And in Chili, which runs an extent of 1300 miles between the Andes and the Pacific ocean, being, at a medium, but about 350 miles wide, there is nothing of this swelling; though the streams are swollen with snow waters; which refutes the hypothesis of those who resolve this protuberance into the drinking snow waters. In examining into the history of nature, there is nothing that has puzzled me more than to account for this phenomenon; if the word phenomenon may be applied to so small an object, which is usually applied to large appearances in the atmosphere, or in the phases of the heavenly bodies. As little can I have an idea that the goitre is to be attributed to the mixture of calcareous earth with the water that descends from the mountains, which is the theory of Coxe; but rather incline to that of Sassure, to account for it, viz. the humidity of the atmosphere; but that mere humidity can occasion it, I do not believe; because, in Ireland or even the north of Scotland, which are moist climates, there is nothing of it. Yet that this, which may be called a malady, has some connection with moisture, I incline to think; inasmuch as from my own observation those situate near ponds, or in wet grounds, are most liable to be affected. But, what is more to the purpose, on interrogating individuals as to their sensations, I have been informed by them, that they are sensible to every change of weather, from dry to moist, and can perceive, to use their own term, a fluttering in that part of the neck, on the approach of rain. I am not of opinion, however, that the cause, whatever it may be, has the least relation to marsh miasma; for the locus in quo, as the lawyers say, where this disorder is known, is as free from fever, as the driest regions. But I return from this digression to the subject we were upon, the origin of the Germans, and the language of that people. I feel the more interested in this disquisition, because the Saxon, which was my vernacular tongue, is a dialect of the ancient German; and the mother of the English. The dialect that is spoken by the common people in Cumberland, and the adjoining country of Scotland, called the low lands, is Saxon. It is in this dialect that the old comedy of Gammer Gurton's Needle is written, which is the prototype of the Gentle Shephard of Allen Ramsay. Many of the scenes, that of Maudge the witch, in particular, are evidently borrowed, so far as respects the character of the personage. I wonder that it is not looked up, and printed with the Gentle Shepherd, that it may be seen how nearly they resemble. It will be found in a collection of old plays, by Dodsley; amongst which the model of Shakespeare's Othello, in a tragedy by a certain Jan, or John Pafre, will be seen. In looking over these, it will appear that what is called blank versification, was written with great felicity before his time, in that fluent way which he has preserved, and which is the only way in which it is tolerable to me, that of Milton excepted. For the versification of neither Thompson, or Young, do I greatly relish; and that of Cowper as little. Congreve comes the nearest what I can bear. But I recur to a consideration of the language of nations, not meaning stile in composition, but the sounds by which ideas are expressed; and those sounds attempted to be communicated by letters of the alphabet; I say, attempted; for after all that can be got by the arbitrary marks which we call letters, it is by the ear alone that we can catch the real sounds that are intended; it is only by a length of time that the ear can catch a sound, or the tongue be brought to imitate it. It for this reason that it is thought that those who have a taste for music, and some facility in catching a tune, could most easily acquire the pronunciation of a language; though I have my doubts of this; for there seems to be no immediate connection between the faculty of singing, and of speaking merely; not that I will undertake to say that softness of features and softness of voice are not connected; for beautiful features always appear to have more delicacy of expression, than the homely; and a handsome woman to sing more sweetly, if she can sing at all, than one that is what we call an ordinary person; whether it is that the imagination cheats the ear, and what is more lovely to the eye, is also more pleasing to that organ. A young man in the pulpit is thought to possess greater powers of oratory in proportion as he has the advantage of personal appearance. In fact the goodly person has the advantage before any audience. Cicero considers stature, as an advantage to the orator. A public speaker must be tall; or have such powers as to be able to make those that hear him forget that he is of a small stature. This was in the power of Garrick, according to the poet Churchhill. Figure, I own, at first, may give offence, And harshly strike the eye's too curious sense; But when perfections of the mind break forth; Fancy's true fire, and judgment's solid worth; When the pure genuine flame by nature taught, Bursts into act, and every word is thought; Before such merit all objections fly; Pritchard's genteel, and Garrick six feet high. It strikes me as very extraordinary that those whose province is speaking, do not think of assisting the personal appearance more, by the article of dress: I mean in the costume or model of the coat, which is that of the labourer, rather than of the man of the gown; I meant to have said of the long robe; for the vest and coat that sits close to the body, and is short, has not the dignity of a more loose and flowing garment. And hence a speaker appears better in what we call a surtout, than in that which sits tight to the body. He will feel more easy in such a vestment; though he must be careful when he turns his back to the fire not to burn the tail; but at the same time, it will not do to take it up in order to warm his backside, because a delicate man will not wish to have it brought into view that he has a backside to warm. For nature having an antipathy to the posteriors has turned them behind, which Longinus notices, as an illustration of a precept of good writing. It is true the jocky-coat, being slit behind, a corner may be taken up under each arm; but the attitude is ungraceful. A friend of mine once, for whom I had a great good will, introducing his son, asked my opinion what he should do with him—He had given him some education, and was at a loss, whether to put him to study law, physic, or divinity. I recommended to a handycraft employment. But an experiment of a learned profession being uselessly made, the father, after some years, wondering at the sagacity I had discovered, having had no opportunity at the time I had given my opinion, of knowing any thing of the lad, but just seeing him on his being introduced to me, enquired on what ground I had formed my judgment; I told him frankly, that I had seen at a glance what he was in the stamina of his mind, by the manner of his turning his back to the fire, and taking up his coat behind. For there is a delicacy of feeling which always accompanies genius; and which shews itself in even the smallest particulars. A diligent observer will find in what may be thought the most indifferent actions, enough to indicate the portion of intellect which has fallen to the share of a young person. For as a great general at a coup d' oeil, or glance of the eye, can catch all the advantages of ground to draw up upon, and manœuvre his army; so one acquainted with the human physiognomy, and is attentive to the movements of the body, can give a pretty good guess whether the boy is to be denominated a John Bull-calf, or Nicholas Bottom the weaver. I have not the same skill in the female character, and might be mistaken in my ideas of what a young lady might be brought to be; but having been employed a great part of my early life in the academies, and in the instruction of youth, I had acquired some degree of sagacity in distinguishing the aptitude for pursuits in life. And I cannot say that this has been the source of much advantage to me; but on the contrary, of much vexation, to see those whom nature intended for hucksters, and haberdashers of small wares, pushed forward into the learned professions, and calling themselves lawyers, or affecting to be politicians, and conductors of the affairs of government. I well know that no man's opinion can be considered as importing absolute verity; but so far as my opinion will carry weight with it, I can say that I have known judicial characters who, if things had taken place according to their gravity in the moral world, would have been at the bottom of the stair-case; at least would never have risen higher than keeping a shop of merchandize, and in that situation might have been respectable. For far be it from me to undervalue men's occupations under whatever denomination. It is the unfitness, the incongruity of talents for the occupation, that I arraign. Felices agricolæ, sua si bona norint. Happy might the dunces be if they knew their happiness; that is, could they distinguish where it was to be found. But returning from this digression to the thread of our discourse. I take it, the Basternæ were that people from whom the Saxons of the Weser and Vistula were principally descended. For after their repulse by the Romans, under Augustus, when they attempted to enter Thrace, they would seem to have pressed upon the west of Europe, and occupied this quarter. The Getæ or Goths, were more upon the Rhine, and the heads of the Danube. Turner, in his history of the nations which have emigrated from beyond the Elb, has proved or rendered it extremely probable, that a great country was lost during the dark ages, on the west of Europe, of which Greenland, and Iceland are remains. For it appears from the archives of Denmark, that from very ancient time, that kingdom had colonies in that quarter; and an intercourse had been kept up which had been discontinued during the adumbration of the north from the inundation of barbarous nations. We are certainly but little acquainted with that corner of the earth; the Romans having had no knowledge of it; much less the Greeks living more remote from the scene. It is but extremely little we know of the earth we live upon, so far as respects mankind; nor, perhaps, is it to be regretted; for to what purpose would it be to know more, but to increase our knowledge of bloody battles; or, of individual misery. Would it not rather be desirable that the whole remembrance of past events was struck out of our minds, and that we had to begin a new series? What happens every day now, is so like what happened before, that the sameness is wearisome. Instead of consuming so much time in acquiring a knowledge of history, we might employ ourselves in searching the mountains for simples, or digging for minerals. Chemistry begins to be once more a fashionable study; but the fine arts, music, painting, poetry and architecture, occupy so much of the time of education for a young person, that there is not leisure, or space left for the more useful pursuits. I have not mentioned statuary; for there are few amongst us that handle the chisel in any other way than as joiners, or carpenters. Caruchi was guillotined as being concerned in constructing what was called the infernal machine, for the purpose of blowing up Bonaparte. It is astonishing that one so far above his species in the divine art of imitating a man by the fabrification of the hand, should have thought of destroying an original. It was this Caruchi that proposed the representation of in sculpture, ringing the rivers from her hair. David the painter, is also one of those wonderful personages; for such I call them, who possess the sublime of genius in one of the fine arts; that of painting what would seem extraordinary; he was said to be one of the most bloody of the revolutionary tribunal, at least subservient to them. Now there is a delicacy, and fineness of mind, so to speak, in such kind of intellects, that it astonishes me, how cruelty can find its way to mix with it. Is there reason to suppose that this earth is, with respect to some superior order of beings, but a beehive; and that they are amused looking at our working? It is humiliating enough, to conceive so of our insignificance, and therefore I repel the idea; but supposing it be so, it must be amusing to them to see the same revolutions over again in the moral world. The like abstract notions in metaphysics, and theology, with similar experiments in government. For it is true what the wise man observes, “there is nothing new under the sun.” I have no idea that the Theagony of Hesiod, as it is applied to action in the Iliad, and Odyssy of Homer, and continued down in the Eneid of Virgil, will be revived in the faith of nations while any vestige remains of the credence. For there must be novelty in the hypothesis that will attract. Though I will admit that boldness, or rather extravagance in the belief, is most likely to be successful. The preceding dissertation on the origin of the languages of Europe, and incidentally upon other subjects, may seem incongruous with the nature of this work; did it not occur to a diligent observer, that there can be nothing incongruous, or inconsistent, with a book which embraces all subjects, and is an encyclopedia of the sciences. It is an opus magnum, which comprehends law, physic, and divinity. Were all the books in the world lost, this alone would preserve a germ of every art. Music, painting, poetry, &amp;c. Statuary it says the least about. Nevertheless, some hints are given that will serve to transmit the reputation of Phidias and Praxiteles; and stimulate the efforts of the chisel upon stone, in generations yet to come. Yet, disliking egotism, and all appearance of vanity in others, I am unwilling to emblazon, beyond what is moderate, a production of my own. But, to speak my mind a little freely, leaving the bible out of the question, which taking it even as a human composition, may be termed a divine book; a collection of tracts unequalled in all ages by other writers; and conceding to Homer his superiority; and to Shakespeare, and Plutarch's Lives, I do not know, but I certainly flatter myself, that my performance may occupy the next grade. But I will not say more at this time, least I be accused of boasting, and be called a braggadocia; an imputation carefully to be avoided by all who would escape envy, and the vexations of that malignant passion. CHAPTER II. THE neighbouring country being peopled a good deal from the north of Ireland, the early teachers of youth were from thence. What were called redemptioners, or persons unable to pay for their passage, contracting to be sold in this country for what time might be necessary to raise the money, were bought for schoolmasters; or put to that employment in the summer; and in the winter to weaving, or cord-waining, or whatever other trade, or occupation, they were qualified to exercise, from the use of it in the old country. It was in this way that Greece had her first preceptors from Crete; and again, Rome from Greece. And in the same manner, letters were brought into Italy, by the emigrants after the fall of Constantinople. It was under the tuition of one of these that the governor had been taught the first elements. The master, as he was called, had a small staff attached to a strap of leather cut into thongs; the flagellum, or whip, and ferule in the same instrument. Nor was he sparing in the use of this inforcer of discipline. For as he had not a facility of communication of ideas, it was necessary to drive more by the hand; for “when the iron is blunt, you must put to more strength:” which was rendered still more necessary from the want of those introductions to spelling, by division of words into syllables, which are now in use. Thornton in his prize essay, on the facilitating early pronunciation, has shown the advantage of beginning with the consonants, to give the sounds, and letting the vowels follow. Thus, ba, be, instead of ab, or eb. But such nicety was not attended to by the resolute men by whom the youth of that day were initiated in the first mysteries. The conjoining, and the reaching of sounds, was less studied; the system being that of direct force. I have seen a score go through their facings on a Monday morning, by flagellation; for it was thought most advisable to whip first, and go to get their tasks afterwards. And in proportion as the schollar was a favourite, he was the more roughly handled. A higher grade of men of this education, and discipline, had got possession of the pulpits; the leading doctrines Vol. IV. K of which, in the mouth of some of these, were not calculated to give the most favourable impressions of the nature of the divinity. It is of a later period, that we are indebted to this cunabula for editors of papers. Said I, to one of these, why do you attack me, who have no ill will to you? God love your shoul, said the Paddywhack, it is not you I am attacking; it is the party. This set me a thinking; and certainly one has no more reason to be offended with a shot from one of these; for they mean nothing more personal, than with the gunner who points the battery. It is not an individual that he aims at, as individual; but as one of the squadron; the more eminent in character, the more prominent to the aim; and instead of defamation, it is a compliment, to be thought worthy of a piece levelled, or the artillery directed. In the midst of abuse, this has reconciled me to the bearing it; and, in fact, in the contention of parties, the passing by a man, is a sure proof that he is insignificant. Speaking of foreign emigration, it occurs to me to say a few words on the subject of French influence: and in doing this, I must take notice, that those who canvass this matter, do not go far enough back. It could not but have been agreeable to France, to hear of the revolt from the authority of Britain, being a rival nation; and the presumption was, that France would at least wish well to the opposition. In fact, they did wish well, and at a very early period, began to discover it in acts. If she did not openly receive our ambassadors at first, she did privately; and under the idea of commercial arrangements by individuals, she slurred supplies of ammunition, and the means of war. French engineers and soldiers of fortune, came to serve in our armies; and young nobility, as to a military school. Even an army came in due time, when she had acknowledged our independence; and French money was distributed: many thousand French crowns were circulated. But for this we could not have carried on the war. France is certainly opposed to our giving up our independence, and returning to our obedience to Great Britain. But, be this as it may, certain it is, that the success of the French arms, at Marengo, at Jena, at Austrelitz, at Friedland, at Wagram, and other places, have obstructed our re turn; which may be termed an indirect French influence. I shall not pursue this train of thinking; it is enough to have given a hint. It cannot be denied, however, but that one thing the French have done for the world, the advantage of which all protestants will agree in admitting; the putting down the Pope. Nor is the prospect hopeless, but that Mahomet will be reduced; a thing remembered in the prayers of those whom we call the faithful, for a long time in Christendom. CHAPTER III. THE mind of man is active, and the great secret of managing it, is to find employment for it. L' ennui, for which we have not a correspondent English word, is the feeling of a vacant mind. We had a phrase in the old Saxon, and which still exists in that dialect of it which we call broad Scotch which hits it exactly; it is to think lang. O' woe, quo he, were I as free As when I first saw this country, How blythe and merry would I be, And I wad never think lang. The mind inactive loses its spring; and it ought to be the study of all who are concerned in the early education of youth, to devise employment for them; and in communities, to find means of occupying the grown persons. This to keep the man from pursuits that are injurious to himself or to others. Where an army is not to be raised, and soldiers enlisted, the making turnpike roads, and digging canals, is an excellent substitute for this draught of the superfluity of population, and a proportion of society who have not the foresight, or perseverance to devise employment for themselves. Hence it is, that they are mustered in elections by the ambitious, for their own private views; and these are they who are made use of to call out for a change of the constitution; Not that all who make use of them for this purpose, mean more than to advance themselves by the aid of the confusion which they excite. For when men are out of power, they wish the drawing of the lottery to begin again, and the prizes drawn to go for nothing. The blanks that are drawn do not give satisfaction. Not but that the common people are of themselves sufficiently disposed to novelty. A desire of a change is the characteristic of the multitude, at all times. And even if a man has no prospect of ameliorating his condition, it helps a little that it is not always the same. Though the next plank is as hard as that on which a man lies, it is pleasant to roll upon it. It is a great misfortune, when a restless spirit has a faculty of haranguing; and still more so, if he has ideas, and can get himself placed at the head of a paper. He is restrained by feelings of delicacy only in proportion as he wants terms to express himself. If one of these should happen to be of the kingdon emphatically so called, because it has been but nominally a kingdom for some ages, he brings the same licence into his paper, that he shewed at the fairs of Liffy, or Tipperary, with a shamrock in his hat, and a shilelah in his hand.— Yet there is in the history of that people in their own country, something greatly to be valued: their hospitality, and generosity. An Irishman has no mean vices.— He is brave and open in his enmity; and sets the law at defiance, at the same time with the public opinion. It is an old adage, an ounce of prevention, is worth a pound of cure: or, as the mock doctor of Smollet has it, Bestum est curare distemprum ante habestum. It is but a slovenly way of reforming a man, to hang him. Some indeed have their doubts whether it is lawful to hang a man at all, or take away life in society.— Certainly nothing can justify it, but the necessity of self-preservation. If a man had killed five hundred, and the remainder can be safe, the necessity of taking away the life of the murderer ceases; and it is unlawful to put him to death. But where a man kills one, a presumption arises that he will kill two, and it is on the principle of precavention that he is suspended, or otherwise taken from society. Banishment is unquestionably the proper mulct to him who has forfeited the benefits of society. But the culprit may come back, and take and repeat his blows; or he may commit mischief in the place to which he is sent, or to which he may come; or another society may refuse to receive him. But the Jewish lawgivers said, “Whosoever sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed:” but if that is to be taken strictly, hanging is no shedding blood; and yet the murderer is hung, not beheaded. The meaning is predictive; and as much as to say, that in the natural course of things, the taking the life of a man, leads to the loss of a man's own. But taking it even as injunctive, and as pointing out that punishment which retributary justice ought to inflict, it must be taken as applicable to the Jews in the wilderness, whose unsettled life did not admit of places of confinement sufficiently safe to secure offenders. While they were journeying K 2 from Kadesh Barnea to Cushanrishatharim, they must be at a loss what to do with the malefactor; and therefore it saved trouble to despatch him from the world. In a country where the sitting is permanent, to borrow a phrase from the French national assembly, and where strong buildings can be erected like the old or new jail of Philadelphia, what necessity can there be to put a man out of the world? He can be put to work, and to make some amends to the community for the life he has taken away, and the expence of bringing him to punishment. As for himself, is he not more punished by solitude, or labour, than by the infliction of death? It does not follow, that if left to a man's self, he would prefer confinement to death, that for this reason, the punishment is lighter. He has not resolution to consult future happiness, by the enduring present pain. But if it is left to a man to consider whether he would wish to have his enemy confined, or to undergo instant death, would he be willing that his adversary should escape vengeance by getting speedily out of the world? It might be a satisfaction to him that the murderer should go to hell; but he is not sure that he would go there; and when he has him in a work-house, he is sure that he must work. Besides, who can be of so diabolical a nature, as to be reconciled even to a murderer going to hell; and why not allow him space and opportunity to repent, as much as the short life of man will allow, in a cell of confinement with nothing but bread and water, at least until he gives signs of repentance. Be this as it may, from all the examination I have been able to give my own mind, I would think a man more punished who had murdered, to see him in a cell, than on a gallows; what I would think if I had been murdered myself, supposing me still to have the feelings of humanity, in another state, is a different question. I might wish to have my adversary with me there; in order to retaliate, and to have the gratification of retributary vengeance. Unquestionably it must be a feeling of this nature, and a putting ones self in the place of a murdered person, that can lead to an idea that it is but justice to the dead, that the murderer should die. It is but an innovation in the common law of our ancestors, the Saxons, to put to death, when a compensation could be made to the public, and to the relations of the deceased for the injury done, in taking away the life of an individual. It seems to be a dictate of nature; for the early ages of man in all countries, sanctions this mode of atoneing for injuries, not excepting murder itself. Where there was a community of goods, compensation could not be made in this way, and confinement and hard labour would be the only punishment. But, be as it may, if life must go for life, I dislike the mode of taking it. The sus. per col. is an ugly minute on the docket. I do not know that they could have done better before the invention of gun powder; for beheading is not much better; if not rather more shocking, from the mutilation of the body. I would prefer shooting; at least if I was to die myself by the order of the law, that would be my choice; and through the breast rather than the head; for I would not chuse to have the human countenance disfigured. I saw once four deserters shot, sitting on their coffins, and their graves dug beside them, and yet with these terriffic circumstances, I thought them killed prettily in comparison of being put to death by the halter. The guillotine is too appaling, on account of the apparatus. My mode of death, were it left to my choice, I mean death forced, would be to fall by a pistol shot by the hand of a mild compassionate female, drest in white muslin, who would have fortitude to be unmoved; because, in that case, death would be presented with as little terror as the nature of the case would admit. “To paint death as we do, is an injustice, says the duc de Ligne. We should represent it in the shape of a tall, venerable, mild and serene matron with traces of beauty left on her countenance, and her arms opened gracefully to receive us. This is an emblem of an eternal repose after a sad life, replete with anxieties and storms.” I will admit, that the sudden impression, the theatrical effect, so to speak, of a public execution, is calculated to strike the multitude; but it is passing, and as to the deterring from the commission of crimes, no punishment can have any great effect. All depends upon the ways and means of preventing; caution a priore, is the most effectual. I have weighed a good deal in my mind, the speeches of Julius Cæsar and Cato in the Roman senate, on the sentence to be passed on the conspirators, the associates of Cataline. That of Cato prevailed, which was for the putting them to death; and with good reason, on that occasion, which was in the midst of an insurrection, and when a confidence in the power of government was necessary to be expressed, and the audacious intimidated, shewing them what those who had the administration dared to do, against those who had so many of the populace on their side; and because also, in those perturbed times, there was no secure keeping them; they might have got out of custody in a short time, and have gone to increase the numbers of the traitors. Self-preservation, in this case necessity, dictated the putting out of life; yet it is remarkable, with what delicacy the Roman consul expresses the event, walking down to the Forum after their execution: “Vixerunt,” they have lived. The Greeks also, in their mode of expressing the last offices, speak of having accompanied the departed, a little way on their journey. “Odou cimarmenene,” the appointed journey. What an impression must we have of the manners of those times, when torture preceded death; and death itself, was accompanied with all the horror of circumstances. May not the time come, when the putting to death at all, unless in extreme cases, such as those alluded to, will be felt as the proof of an uncivilized state of society; and a remnant of barbarity still retained by the prejudices of the vulgar? CHAPTER IV. THE visionary philosopher had not yet abandoned his project of civilizing the brute creation, and teaching them the arts and sciences. He had caught a young panther, and, with a chain about its neck, had put it to study law with a young man of that profession, who wishing to get forward in the business, thought it could do him no harm, though it might not do the panther much good to undertake the task. But there were those who bore testimony against this, being of opinion that lawyers were bad enough, even when made of the best materials.— This idea was supported by some sensible men, who could not conceive that this animal of the cat kind could ever be brought to be capable of explaining a matter to a jury, or stating a point of law to the court. The visionary philosopher taking fire at this opposition to his discovery, invention, or improvement, or what else it might be called, exclaimed abundantly. What is it, said he, whether he may be ever able to explain himself intelligibly at the bar? Cannot he grin, bite— [There would seem here to be an hiatus in the manuscript, or the sheets misplaced. The editor cannot connect the narrative.] It had come to the knowledge of the people, or, at least, was projected in the mean time, that after the proclamation for scalps, and the hunt which took place in consequenc of it, the governor had been guilty of the most manifest partiality in screening the bog-trotter, who was as much liable as any person, no one having been more noisy in beer-houses, and active at town meetings, to bring about a convention, than he had been; with the exception of Thady O`Conner, who had taken the benefit of the insolvent act; and a few others who had been refused tavern licences at the sessions. It was thought to be a ground of impeachment to connive at the secreting any one on such occasion. The fact was, the governor was as innocent of the charge as any one among themselves, and so he declared to them; that for a considerable time past, he had ceased to have a controul over the bog-trotter; that like Noctra Mullin's dog, he had been at his own hand, these six weeks; that is, since he got in to be constable. The affair was like to take a very serious turn, and the people would not be satisfied; when Angus M`Donald, the Scotch gardener, having knocked down the panther that was studying law, and taken off a piece of his hide, came forward with it, saying it was little matter what had been done with Teague on the occasion alluded to, since he had put the law in force against him just now, and scalped him himself, as they might see by the red hair, and the blood. There is nothing sooner softens a passion, or calms a mad multitude, than the yielding to it. Hence the fury abated in a moment; and when it occurred to them that their remonstrance to the governor had been the occasion of the tragedy, they began to relent, and to blame themselves as having been too precipitate in their representations. The difficulty now occurred, what to do with the bog-trotter. For it would not be safe that he should remain in the government, and that it should be visible that the scalping had been but a substitution, and not the genuine exuvia of the man. Harum Scarum was of opinion that it was best to knock him down in reality, and take his scalp to the people, laying the deception at the door of the Scotchman, as it really ought. The governor was opposed to that, as it was to save him from an impeachment that Angus, with great presence of mind, had bethought himself of the stratagem, to divert the fury of the populace. But the visionary philosopher, in the mean time, enraged at the murder of his crony panther, and the lawyer with whom he was studying, dissatified, or seeming to be so, the circumstance was explained to the people. But they thought enough had been done for once, and that it was not necessary to pursue the matter farther. In fact, some of them were in the secret, and meant only pastime from the beginning. However, thinking it might not be amiss to be out of the way for a while, the bog-trotter was sent over hill to dig potatoes, at the farm of Niel M`Mullin, a neighbouring gentleman. CHAPTER V. It may be thought that in my allusions to impeachment, I may have in view what has happened in this state. It is probable, or rather certain, that it is this which has led me to think upon the subject, and to introduce it in a picture of democratic government, such as that I am now describing. But if it is inferred from thence, that I approve or condemn what has taken place in this state, it will be unfair; or at least a misconception. For I do not mean that any inferences, favourable or unfavourable, should be made from it. On the contrary, I am far from reprobating the power of impeachment in the constitution, or finding fault with a discreet use of it in practice. I look upon it, as the means of avoiding tumults, and assassinations. When dissatisfaction with the conduct of public officers, is suffered to shew itself, and to have a vent in this way, the public mind, having an opportunity of hearing grievances discussed, and getting to know the real demerit, good or bad, of the functionary, is more likely to be satisfied, and it is safer for the object of the obloquy. Nor, on examination, will it be found, that in many cases, where there is a public dissatisfaction with an officer, there has not been some foundation laid; if not in the very particular that is made the subject of enquiry, yet in some other that has led to it. As for instance; even in the case of Scipio Africanus, where, perhaps, a just cause has been the least suspected to have existed of all instances of a great man impeached, that are to be found in history. Yet if any one will read Livy attentively, in his account of the way in which this young man came forward into public life, he may anticipate the vexations he experienced after he had accomplished great things for the commonwealth. His error was, a premature competition for office. Before the age allowed by law, he set up for the Edile-ship, and carried it by the undue favour of the populace. “Si me, omnes Quirites edilem facere volunt, satis annorum habeo.” How arrogant the expression; how insulting to the tribunes and Fabius Maximus, and others of the senate who opposed it? His offering himself for the proconsulate in Spain before his 24th year, quatuor et viginti annos ferme natus, professus se petere, was more excusable from the occasion. But it was in some degree by an affectation of religion and arts of dissimulation, that he had prepared the public mind, to favour his premature pretensions. From the time that he had put on the toga virilis, to this, he had been preparing the minds of the people. There was no day, before he did any thing private or public, but that he went into the capital, and entering a temple, sat down, and for the most part alone, in secret, and spent there some time. This custom, which was preserved through his whole life, whether designedly, or that it so happened, procured credit to the opinion published by some, that he was a man of a divine stock, and brought up the story before common, of Alexander the Great, and equal to it, in fable and variety, that he had been conceived of a huge dragon, which had been seen in the bed of his mother; and which tale he increased by the art of neither contradicting nor assenting. On his return from Spain, after the expiration of his proconsulate, he was willing to have accepted a triumph, though to that day, there had been no instance of any one triumphing, for whatever successes, unless he had had the command in chief; or, as the historian expresses it, qui sine magistratu res gessisset. It is true, it is said that “the hope of a triumph was rather tried than obstinately persisted in.” But it shews a too great forwardness to catch at honours. But the inordinate nature of his ambition was more evident, on his obtaining the consulship. He grasped at Africa for his province though not according to his lot, “nulla jam modica gloria contentus.” And this he said openly, he would carry by the people, even if the senate set themselves against it. He made his words good, and the senate, with all the authority and reputation of Fabius Maximus, venerable from age and wisdom, and other aged likewise and experienced, were bullied by the tribunes and people into an acquiescence. I cannot help considering his conduct in procuring the province of Africa for his brother Lucius, having Lælius for his colleague in the consulship, who equally was ambitious of that designation, as extremely indelicate in throwing his weight into the scale, in the deliberation of the senate between the two, by offering to serve under his brother as his lieutenant; if they would prefer his brother. By this means, and by his previous advice to his brother in submitting the matter to the senate, rather than to the chance of a lot, and thus having it in his mind to use the address of offering his services in a subordinate capacity, which was, in fact, obtaining the command for himself, he fixed in the minds of the principle men much chagrin and dislike. And deservedly; for ambition is self-love; and when it is at the expence of others, it is odious. Every man in a community has what may be ranked among the imperfect rights in society, a right to have his age considered, in pretention to office; and not to be intruded upon by the coming generation before its time; much less to have power engrossed even by virtue itself, or the most distinguished ability. For the keeping the flame of public spirit burning, is the vital principle of republican government, to which there is nothing more smothering than inequality in the chance of obtaining offices, honours, and emoluments. And if the next generation come on too soon, the seniors are pressed out, and lose their chance. Nor is it only by the younger intruding that this equality is effected, but the usurping by those of any age, of what is not equal.— And I call it usurpation, where any thing is obtained; what is more, where any thing is even taken, that reasonably ought to go to another, in consideration of standing, ability, or services. If these are obtained by popular favour, unduly coveted, what reason has the candidate to complain, or good men to regret, if the same caprice that has advanced, should, notwithstanding unimpeachable conduct, nevertheless impeach. We shall see that this was the case with Scipio. He was impeached by the tribunes of the people on a charge of peculation, and converting the public money to his own use, in which there was no truth; but in the remainder of the charge, there was truth; “that he had pushed himself forward to foreign nations in a manner as if peace and war with the Roman people depended upon him alone: That he had gone out as a dictator to his brother, rather than as a lieutenant; and for no other purpose, but that he might shew himself, and have it believed in the east, as he accomplished in the west, that he should seem the head, and the pillar of the Roman empire: That a state, the mistress of the world, should seem to be under the shade of his power: That his nod Vol. IV. L stood in place of the decrees of the senate, or the orders of the people.” The charge of peculation he could easily answer; but these things he could not answer; nor was there any thing so definite in them, that strictly speaking, they could be made the ground of an impeachment; but it was easy to see that by reason of them, the alleged offence would be established, and which alone could come within the laws. He chose to withdraw from the trial, and go into banishment. If, in like manner, impeachments that have brought a reproach upon republics were examined, it might be found, that in the greater part of them, bating sudden errors, and mistakes, incident to all human affairs, there would be found, though not the best foundation for the particular charge alleged, and the sentence pronounced, yet remotely something blameable, which had led to the making the charge in question. But even taking it as matters seem to be on the surface of things, the wrongs of democracy, and injustice of public characters, will be found to fall short of those under lurid despotism. For a view of this, let the history of the Roman empire, by Livy, be compared with that of the same people under the emperors, as we have it by the divine pen of Tacitus. There is no one who will consult the nature of things, or look into what has taken place in popular governments, but will think that there is greater chance for justice to an honest man, than where this depends upon the caprice of an individual. For it is not the despot himself that is alone to be dreaded; it is those he has about him, and will allege words spoken of him, or acts done against his government; when, in fact, it is their own resentment, for something done, or said, or omitted to be done, or said, which they wish to gratify. A despotic government is safer for a dishonest man, and he has the best chance of coming forward there, where it is not ability or integrity that recommends, but subserviency to the passions of the prince. But it is the rage of mere democracy that has brought reproach upon republicks; democratic power unbalanced, is but the depotism of many instead of one. It is the balancing with stays and braces of distributed powers that gives safety. This distribution of power is the highest effort of the mind, and yet you will find but few, who, like my bog-trotter, will not conceive that they could form a constitution that would give energy and guard liberty. It is this false idea, overweaning conceit, that I have it in view to ridicule. I am willing to give it the whole force of my indignation, in proportion as I know the error, and the consequences. Let any man look at a book published in this state, under the specious title of “Experience the test of government,” and see the crude conceptions that it contains; I do not know by whom written, and he will be sensible of the consequences of putting the modelling of a constitution into such hands. “I am not afraid of the people of Pennsylvania,” said a pompous orator to me. The fact was, he had nothing to be afraid of, unless they would take his scalp. Nor am I afraid of them on my own account; but on theirs; at least I am afraid on their account, as well as my own. For the formation of a government, is not a matter to which the bulk are competent: or if they will indulge caprice in changing, and they will go to change; whenever a change is made, it will be but a majority that is satisfied, and perhaps that not great; and it is to be expected that a portion of the majority, not finding their account in the change, will associate with the former minority, and hence a change, and so toties quoties, until only one remains that is to be satisfied. It will be said, impeachment is of no use; the constitution being such, that a conviction cannot follow; it requiring such a proportion of the tribunal, before whom the impeachment comes to trial, to be of a mind. Is it nothing even in the case of an acquittal, to be scared half to death? Even on a representation of the people, and a citation before a committee of the house of representatives, one may as well be half hanged, as to undergo the terror. Can any one, looking at the quarter sessions, think that there is no good by trying, even where there is no condemnation? I have known many a man tried, that I thought guilty in the letter of the law, and perhaps spirit, but if acquitted by the exclusion of testimony not legal, or the leaning of the jury on the side of himself, or otherwise, I did not think there was nothing in the having brought to trial, and shaken the prisoner well over the indictment, or rather the indictment over him. He might reform and it would be a warning to him. It is possible, that something like oppression and tyranny, or bordering on these, both to people and bar, may have been complained of in judges with some cause in times past. Is it to be supposed that what has taken place, has contributed nothing to arrest, or remove this grievance? Would not the oppression and tyranny seem to have veered to the other side now, and to be found, in some degree, if not with the people, at least with the bar. It has seemed to me to be so, and it is therefore, but an emanation of my feelings when I pourtray in my imagination the disorder of untamed animals admitted to be advocates. It is doubtless a caricatura of what I mean, but a thing has usually some excess in it, to be felt as the proper subject of a caricatura. While the lawyer has it in his power to influence his client; and even to excuse his own ignorance or errors, by laying the loss of a cause upon a judge, or alleging oppression, the client can apply to a house of representatives, and the judge, of course, be brought down with facility, the presumption is, that he will bear a great deal of impertinence, impudence, and irregularity, before he will think it advisable to endanger the running the gauntlet, by entering into a contest with a powerful member of the bar. I do not mean powerful in point of talents; for there is nothing to be apprehended from men of ability; it is from the uninformed that the difficulty arises; and insults are received from them, because it is the instinct of their natures, to cover their defects by noise and arrogance; or, from a want of knowledge, they think themselves monstrously wronged, when they have the fairest hearing, and the fullest justice. The suitors of the court, the jurors, the circumstantes, or bystanders, complain of the length of speech in the lawyers, and of the judges for suffering them.— There was a time when the judges might have taken some liberty in restraining, or at least in frowning on diffusiveness of explanation; but more caution must be used now, lest offence should be given; judges being more under the weather than formerly. A prudent man in a judicial station, will bear for the present, what he will not always bear; because he will discern that this is not the time to make head; but that after some time, the current may begin to set in a different direction; and that may then succeed which now would but strengthen the tide. Besides, it is difficult to say when the speech is too long; and it may be a question whether the court ought to be suffered to judge of that. The constitution provides that a man shall be heard “by himself or his counsel;” but it does not say how long he shall be heard. Admit the court may have a right to say, that the speech has been long enough as to them, have they a right to say that it has been long enough for the jury. How can they tell whether the jury are satisfied? What is more; is it the court or jury that have the right to say, that they have heard enough? Or, is it the suitor or his counsel, who have a right to say, we have not been sufficiently heard? Tyranny and oppression in refusing to hear, may be charged; and thus it is a matter that must depend a good deal upon the temper of the times, and upon a discreet discernment of what is practicable, on particular occasions, or with particular persons, that a judge must determine what to do. A man of sense at the bar, is easily manageable; but a weak man is as difficult to manage, as the visionary philosopher's panther. Do our representatives in our legislative bodies, always confine themselves to the point, though they may to the question? In other words, is it possible to keep them to order, though it may be to call them? Is it found possible to abridge their harangues while breath and strength of lungs last? If those whose business is not speaking can find such facility in prolonging a discourse, what may not be expected of such as are more in the habit; and without fatiguing themselves, can speak interminably? Were our orators in the legislative bodies as much in the hearing of the people, as the advocates of our courts, they might be complained of as much for the length of their speeches. In the courts, it is no uncommon thing for the judges to express a weariness of the tediousness of counsel; and sometimes to attempt to bring them to the point, and to abridge their harangues; but it will seldom, if ever, be found to answer any end but to prolong the discussion; for if you restrain at one point, there will be an overflowing at another; and it being like to come to an altercation, which is indecent, it will seem best to give up the contest, and let the thing take its course. The line is so delicate between unseasonable interruption by the court in calling to the point, and what is justifiable, that it is difficult to fix it without doing injustice, and impossible without giving L 2 dissatisfaction. In human affairs, there is no reaching the perfect in the application of principle. All that can be done, is to come as near it as possible, by a just discernment of circumstances. What is done, may be blamed; but there might be more blame, had the contrary been done. CHAPTER VI. CONSIDERATIONS ON THE POWER OF IMPPEACHMENT—Continued. THE power of impeachment, is the most salutary principle of a free government. Where there is a full scope for this, there is no danger of convulsions; and there is a prospect that the constitution may be preserved. Injustice may be done: no doubt of that, and injustice a thousand times, has been done. But it is the fortune de guerre; the fate of war; in other words, a tacit condition of the acceptance of an office. It is a maxim of law, qui sentit commodum sentire debet et onus. A good book might be written on the history of impeachments. It would be instructive; and might be entertaining. I would like to see the sentiment I have broached, fully developed; and the history of impeached characters, so far traced, as to see whether some conduct in a public capacity, or in the ways and means of getting at public office, or appointment, had not laid the foundation of the ultimate prosecution. The presumption is, that the shoe must have pinched somewhere, to have produced that uneasiness which has been felt; and which has terminated in a public accusation. And, in some particular perhaps, in which the individual may have deserved commendation rather than blame; but upon which it has been thought the more practicable to succeed, taking into view the prejudices of the times. Such an investigation of causes and effects, might save the character of democratic governments from much blame. I admit it would not perfectly justify the impeaching for one cause, while another was more in the minds of the public; but it would account for it, and excuse it. One is less shocked at the imprisonment and fine of Miltiades, when we recollect his demand of an olive crown after the battle of Marathon. It was answered to him, “when you shall conquer alone, it will be time enough to ask to have honours paid you alone.” It may easily be seen, from his coveting this distinction, that his ambition was not sufficiently regulated; and it may be inferred, that the like spirit exhibited in other instances, may have given just offence to a people jealous of equality. I have known a man in office, whose sordid mind in money matters, appeared to me to render him undeserving of an office; and though this could not render him liable to an impeachment; yet, if he was impeached for something bordering on what was impeachable, there would be a predisposition to be reconciled to his being found guilty. For no man deserves an office in a republic, that is mean in money matters, and is justly chargeable with a sordid oeconomy. Inordinate self-love in the accumulation of office, in a single family, is at all times obnoxious to popular dislike, and the most upright discharge of a public function, will not atone for the engrossing money in one's own person, or that of connections. One consideration ought to go a great way in reconciling the public mind, in a popular government, to the bearing these things when they occur, that nature is constantly acting to remove the grievance, by death, and in this way to bring about rotation in office. Combinations will be broken by the quiet operation of this general law; pluralities will disappear; and the poor devil that is disgracing himself by a nearness that is contemptible, cannot always live to enjoy, if he ever may be said to enjoy the savings of his penury. In the mean time, it is a satisfaction, that if the general contempt is not felt by him, it is felt by every one else. Where a man is liberal in his private dealings, and contributes to objects of utility according to his means, he is thought deserving of office, and his generosity and public spirit, like charity, will cover a multitude of sins. It is rare that such a character becomes the subject of popular prosecution. Where indeed his liberality is but the stilt of his ambition; and this is indulged so as to wound the self-love of others, we need not wonder if it draws persecution. The most manly thing that I know in the history of the Roman senate, is the impeaching Manlius Capitolinus. Generosity, and public spirit on his part had shewed itself to be but the stilt of ambition. That is, it was not public spirit, but inordinate self-love. He had saved Rome in defending the capital; but he was not satisfied with the consciousness of this, and the gratitude of his country on all occasions expressed; but he must be the only man of any name in the state. With a view to this, what were his arts? Affecting to be the advocate of all confined for debt; paying debts himself for some, with ostentation; shewing his wounds and scars, and perpetually talking of having defended the capital, haranguing against the senate, and charging them with concealing the public treasures; remonstrating with the community on their not knowing their own strength, and doing themselves justice in the government. From these arts, such was his influence with the body of the people, that even the dictator Cornelius Cassus the second after Romulus, who had taken the spolia opima; and who was created dictator for this purpose, amongst others, of checking the sedition, dreaded it more than the war against the Volsci, which he was obliged first to meet. For though returning victorious over the enemy, and armed with the honour of a triumph, yet he considered the contest at home as the more formidable; and though he had ordered him into custody, yet had not thought it advisable to proceed farther against him. It was thought that his abdicating the dictatorate, which he did at this time, was owing to his not chusing to meet the tempest that was breaking out on behalf of this demagogue to liberate him from the prison. The consuls now chosen, and the senate, were in consternation, when at the proposition of two tribunes of the people, Marcus Mœnius, and Quintus Publius, the bold measure was adopted of charging him before the people themselves, and bringing him to an impeachment. The result was, that the very people rallying onward to support him, were arrested in a moment at the idea of guilt charged upon him, and themselves made the judges. What was the charge? Why simply that of attempting to destroy the balance of the government, by inflaming the populace, and running down the senate.— Yet, strange as it may seem, this very populace who were alleged to be the subject of his arts, and the means of his treason, on a fair examination, found him guilty; and in order to stamp his conduct with perpetual disgrace, it was provided, that no one of the family of Manlius, should ever bear the name of Marcus, which was his name. He was thrown from the Tarpeian rock like the vilost of criminals. CHAPTER VII. UNDER the existing constitution, the patronage of the governor was considerable. This very thing which at first view would seem to be a ground of his security, was the cause of much uneasiness, and constant opposition to his administration. For not in one case out of ten did he make an appointment, but some concerned became enemies. The one appointed was an enemy because his appointment was not as good as he had expected; and the others of the community were dissatisfied, because he got any appointment at all. For there was not one who did not think himself better entitled, at all events, better qualified. Some were vexed because they had not been chosen governor themselves, and no appointment would have satisfied them. There was a weaver amongst these who had pretensions to the chair, and raised a clamour against the constitution, thinking that in the confusion that would ensue, things being once more put into hotch-pot, he might renew his chance for the office of chief magistrate; that having failed to be put in nomination under existing circumstances he might have better luck under a new arrangement. A second chance he would have at all events, and it might be more favourable in the result; inasmuch as the very bustle he was making in the affair of the new constitution, would bring him into great notice, and increase his popularity, there being now an indifferent mass of citizens who were dissentients from the same motives with himself, and might promise themselves something from the confusion of affairs. But the proposition of a new constitution, as being less alarming to the bulk, was suggested under the idea of an amendment. For the revolutions in France about this time had created some alarm, at the idea of changing rapidly all at once from one constitution to another. But who was there who could have any reasonable apprehensions of risk or danger from an amendment? But it being thought adviseable to specify some amendments in order the better to bring about a convention, there was no one that had not the sagacity to find out some things that might be put on a better footing than they had been. As for instance; the weaver seemed to think that the price of weaving ought to be raised; and that no customer should hereafter find fault with the work done; and that he should pay for it as soon as it was done. All this seemed reasonable, especially as the cordwainer, and the brick-layer could easily see that in the course of the deliberation, it would naturally take a wider range, and introduce a clause providing for them also. For though not by name in the first instance; yet all occupations would be virtually included and enjoy the advantage of the like reform It had become a cry pretty much prevailing, that the sitting of the people should be permanent: and the constitution revolutionary; so that whenever, and wherever, the shoe was found to pinch it might be altered. Amongst the malcontents with the constitution, it was not a little unexpected by the governor, to find Teague Oregan his late protegee and associate in his peregrinations. For notwithstanding he had, in the first instance, been appointed cryer of the court, and in the next, advanced to the grade of auctioneer, he was dissatisfied because he had not been made chief justice, or advanced to that of secretary of state. For these reasons he was amongst the loudest for a reform, and proposed an assembling of the whole people, once more to fix upon a new constitution. The governor conceiving himself to have some kind of right to controul and regulate the ambition of his bogtrotter, took an opportunity to expostulate with him on the danger and inexpediency of the proposition at this time; and more particularly on the indelicacy of persons newly come into the country, taking upon them to be the first to propose a revision of that frame of government, which they had found prepared for them, and what on becoming citizens, they were under an implied obligation to support. Teague, said he, you cannot but recollect the inconsiderable station from which I originally advanced you; being a redemptioner on board a ship from Cork in Ireland. In fact though you called yourself a redemptioner you were a bound servant for years, and in such capacity you were under an obligation to serve me, nevertheless I treated you as a redemptioner, paid the money for you, the passage money, and told you that as soon as you had served me to the amount of it at the yearly hiring of a labouring person, I would give you your liberty. The business that I set you about might be called drudgery, because you were fit for nothing else; but did I not as soon as I conveniently could, endeavour to amend your station, by making you my body servant, and taking you with me almost in the light of a companion in my rambles? In the course of these, in proportion as I saw an opening, I was disposed to advance you still more, and to bring you forward. Was it my fault if in these prospects which seemed to be occasionally flattering, there were some disappointments? You know well what happened from first to last when being made a judge you kicked an associate off the bench. Have I not done as much for you as I well could do, since coming to this new country, and my advance to the chair of government? Did I not make you a crier of the court, and are you not now an auctioneer? What reason had you to expect that I should make you a chief justice, even though you did read law a while, and had been upon the bench in another place? This very circumstance if no other, was a reason against it; for it gave me an opportunity of knowing that you were not fit for it. You have not the patience of a judge even if you had all other qualifications. I could not make you secretary, for you cannot write; and though you might act by deputy, yet it is but an aukward thing for a man to be secretary, which imports by the usage of the term, some ability to minute matters, and not to be able to write his own name. It is impossible for me not to know that whatever you and the others of you who call out for a new constitution are moved not by your opinion of defects visible in the old, but because you think a new may be more favourable to your particular pretensions. But setting aside all that could be said on this alleged point of private views on your part and theirs, is there not some decency to be observed on our part in coming into this country, in proposing innovations? Can a bog-trotter just from Ireland like you be supposed to be cognizant of the genius of the people sufficiently to form a constitution for them? Is it the most delicate thing in the world to undertake to find fault with that which they have formed? I feel it on my part a matter of peculiar delicacy to sport an opinion. It hurts me even that you lately in my train, should cavil against it, least it should be supposed to be at my prompting. Though there can be no ground of presumption that I who have been complimented Vol. IV. M with the government, could cabal to overturn it. Yet one cannot tell what those who are the advocates of what they call a reform may do, or say in order to acquire weight to their machinations. They may pretend, that I who hold an office under the constitution and am sworn to support it, do not approve of it. They will allege in proof of this, my having an officer who is foremost in his vociferation for a change. You do not consider, Teague, where this may end. The termination in France we have all seen; it was the guillotine. What is de guillotine? said Teague. It is, Said the governor, a thing in the shape of a crowbar or a harrow with teeth of a foot long, which they draw over a man's back, and scratch him as you would the earth in: which seed is sown. The truth is, the governor did not himself know precisely the form of this instrument, nor the manner of its operation; but it was necessary to seem to know, and to give a description, as he had alluded to it. It is, continued he, a horrible instrument; and the meddler with constitutions, is in danger of coming under it. A regular tenor of things is the safest condition. In order to be safe from the irons of a saw-mill, let the unskilful beware of meddling with the wheels. In the same manner I may say that the prudent man will keep aloof at these times, from the danger of unseasonably intruding himself as a mender of constitutions — Agreeably to this is the distich of the poet, “Ah me, what perils do environ, The man that meddles with cold iron.” You enjoy the lucrative office of an auctioneer, and having seen a great deal of the world, ought to have begun to learn that those who advise, have not always the interest of those whom they advise, in view. May it not be in order to serve themselves, and perhaps in the turn of affairs to get your office, that persons flatter your vanity as whom it becomes to put yourself at the head of a reform in the state? I would not be willing to take an oath that even some of your own countrymen may not have sinister ends in view, in putting you upon this project.— For that you are propelled, I am strongly inclined to think as I have always found you yourself disposed to be contented with your station, except in cases where the mistaken notions of others working upon your inexperience and mine, have misled our understandings. These reasonings had weight with the bogtrotter, and more especially that part of the expostulation which respected the danger of the guillotine; for though the mode of its use was not minutely explained, yet the impression made, was that of a cutting, or tearing instrument, in either case, painful to the patient. But though intimidated and of himself disposed to cease his opposition to the constitution, and his clamour for a reform, yet his countrymen out of doors, and others of the multitude desirous of a change, still continued active at vendues, particularly, to urge the bogtrotter to a perseverance in his endeavours in favour of what they called liberty. There was no station that could put him so much in the way of being wrought upon by the designing, as that of auctioneer. For it subjected him to flattery, giving an opportunity to compliment the strength of his voice, his vein of humour, which term they could give to his coarse jokes, and call it wit. The bottle occasionally going about, as is the custom in the country, at using which he was no slouch, drew from the croud also much applause; for in proportion as the cryer was pleased, he put about the bottle, and it came in the way of the man that had given the last bid. It was indeed a matter of complaint against him by those who had articles to sell that he would suspend the hammer; or as it was a mallet that he used, he would stand with it lifted up until some one had finished what he had to say about the constitution. And instead of announcing the name of the article put up, and describing its utility, expatiating on its value, he would forget himself, and instead of a good thing, this, or that, he would call out, an excellent constitution; not at half its value; who bids more, another cent buys the whistle. Three times. There were petitions for removal on this ground. But what could the governor do? The mania had become general. Not an individual that was not affected with the rage of constitution making: not an occupation in the exercise of which something relative to amending at least, the constitution, did not break out in the language that was used. It was not alone in the case of the auctioneer, that such a derangement as it might be called, had begun to shew itself; but with persons in almost every other employment. The common mechanic, and labourer were led away both in speaking and acting, with an enthusiasm for a change of constitution. “I saw a smith stand with his hammer thus: The whilst his iron did on the anvil cool. With open mouth swallowing,” the news about a change of constitution. A tailor was asked what he was now making? He said a suit of constitution. A tinker what he was now mending? He said the constitution. All that could write had drawn up forms; all that could not write, had meditated forms, and were reciting them to their neighbours. It was amusing to attend to the various suggestions of the fancy of these improvisatori; or extempore makers of constitutions. Some proposed for an article, the having a provision to fatten hogs without corn; and it was in vain to explain to them that this did not depend upon the constitution of the government; but on that of the hog. Some wanted chickens hatched without eggs: others, harvests raised without the trouble of sewing seed. All were for an amelioration of things in the natural or moral world. A groupe had got together at a distillery; and were endeavouring to put into words, what they would wish with regard to the article of extracting more whiskey out of a bushel of grain. But they were not all of them in a capacity to articulate the article just then, and so it fell through for that time. In order to acquire knowledge on the subject of constitutions, where any one entertained a suspicion that he had not sufficient information, which was a rare case, he applied himself to study the hiding places, or edifices of beasts and birds. For instinct was surer than reason. One man of very honest investigation, was stung in the face as he was inspecting a wasps' nest, and his face became much swollen, and was kept in countenance only by another who was in something of the same plight, from a hive of bees into which he had thrust his nose. That republic being much celebrated, it was thought the purest model that could be studied. A diligent observer of the flight of wild geese, and of the manner in which one stands sentry for the flock when they alight to feed, drew thence what he thought a good lesson towards qualifying him for the task of new modeling a frame of government. But the play upon the word goose which this naturally drew upon him, threw it into ridicule. For it was observed that he must be a goose who would think of modeling a constitution after geese. By others it was called a wild goose chase that he was upon, and little attention was paid to his draught. M 2 CHAPTER VIII. IN this phrenzy of the public mind, it is not to be dissembled that the most active of the constitution menders, were those who had ruined their own constitution, or that of their estates. It was observable also, that emigrants from beyond seas; and especially from the green Isle of Erin, were the most forward in offering themselves for this service. Not knowing the trouble of making a constitution, they thought it light work; being in the habit of calling out against the existing government at home, they did not distinguish that partiality which the people here must have for the work of their own hands, and their unwillingness to have assistance not asked but forced upon them. At all events, supposing them justifiable in the innovation, it cannot be maintained that the volunteers were altogether discreet, in the time of undertaking it. A number of these who had come from the county Monaghan, and other places, being together singing Erin go brah, and talking politics, the governor having actually a regard for them, as a well meaning, but impetuous multitude, thought proper to address them, and remonstrate against their proceedings. A minute of his discourse has been given me, and I have set it down here to diversify the narration. Gentlemen of the bogs, said he, or green hills of Erin: for in the geography of your country, you talk of bogs; but in your songs we hear of nothing but hills—For that reason, I shall speak of hills— Gentlemen of the green hills of Erin, when I cast my eye over the Atlantic Ocean, or rather cast it upon the map, I see your island like an emerald as you call it, set in the waves. It is a pretty little spot, on the face of the earth, I was going to say, but rather as I ought to say, face of the water. Of the internal geography I do not know much, but I have heard of Limerick, and Drogheda, and Sligo, and other places—The Cunabula gentium the birth place of your parentage. But as to those, I have not much attended to them; my attachment is chiefly to the history of the people. I know your origin if I am to believe some, and I am inclined to believe them, that you are of Punic origin, that you have in you the blood of the Asdrubals, and Hamilcars, and Hannibals of antiquity. But as the poet says, Genus, et proavos, et quæ non fecimus ipsi, Vix ea nostra voco.— I set more store by what has been done upon your island in the persons of your immediate progenitors. I am not unacquainted with the fame of many great characters; Fin M`Coul, and Brian Borumy, and others. But for your divisions in your own country, you might have been England, and England Ireland. And though insinuations have been made by writers of a proneness to rob on the highways by some of you, I do not wonder at there being some truth in this. It cannot be a matter of surprize, if after the military spirit of a people has subsided by subjugation, it should break out into petty robberies of the proud victor, and a disposition should remain for a long time, to indemnify ones' self at the expense of the conquerors, for the loss of private fortune. What could have been expected of those who were expelled from the north of your country, the four counties of Ulster, but that they would turn free-booters? I find no fault with the opposition made to the government of England; for you have been oppressed by it; and I do not wonder that a reform was thought of, and zealously attempted by the governor of the country. Though I do not altogether approve the irregular, and consequently useless, disturbances by hearts of oak, as they were called; hearts of steel, white boys, break o' day boys, who broke the peace of the country. For of what avail is disjointed opposition; partial insurrections, which like the struggles of beasts of burden, serve but the more to intangle, and furnish a reason, or at least a pretence for weightier chains, and stronger gearing for the future? For you see that however good your cause, and I will acknowledge that it is my opinion there could not have been a better, yet from immature exertions, and a want of concert, some of you have been under the necessity of absconding, and others of you have been shot. Those of you who have come to this country ought to distinguish circumstances. You have no doubt meditated much, the greater part of you upon political establishments; but it is not a Lycurgus, or a Solon that is wanted so much at this time, as cultivators of the soil. The constitution that is already framed may do awhile until we get more ground cleared, and fences put in repair. You will not for a moment entertain the suspicion that I undervalue your capacity for these things; but I make a quere with regard to the expediency of the occasion. You have all heard of what has happened in the neighbouring country of France, from instability in government and from a change of constitution. The guillotine was the result, you have all heard of the guillotine. The croud, or some one in the croud, acknowledged that they had heard of the guillotine; but had not a perfect knowledge or clear conception of what it was. It is, continued the governor, a machine which works as I understand it, something like a farmer's cutting box. But the noise resembles that of a forge hammer, or a slitting mill. Governor, replied an orator, it is not the sound of iron, or the working of hand saws, that would intimidate an Irishman; nor is it that we think we can make a better constitution than the one that is made, or set up a better government than that of which your honour is the worthy representative, and chief magistrate. But just coming to the country, we like to be concerned in what is going forward. When we see the game played we like to take a hand. Nor is it we alone that are moving in the matter. It is your own people that have been bred and born in the country, that make the most ado. We only come in to take a lift at the log; just as our forefathers did in the war, that is past, where some of us were shot as well as yourselves. Having cleared the ground of the British, along wid you, we are entitled to the raising a cabin on the spot; you may call it a constitution, or what you please. But all we want is a bit of ground to set potatoes and to plant cabbage, with the free use of the shilelah into the bargain, as we had it in our own country. That being the case, said the governor, the constitution that you have, will answer every purpose. It is for securing you in your possessions; and the free use of the shilelah subordinate to no law but that of the country, that the constitution has been framed. But for the constitution and the laws, what would you differ from the racoons and opossums of the woods? It is this which makes all the difference that we find between man and beast. This was an unfortunate expression of the governor, and gave countenance to the theory that had begun to prevail about this time, that there was no radical difference between man and beast. And of this we may hear more in the subsequent chapters of this book. But not being in a hurry with this narrative, we shall not go on with the history of this phrenzy of imagination just immediately. It is time to rest a while; that is, to dip the pen till one looks about and reflects upon what has gone before, and may come after. What that may be I cannot well tell; for though I have all the matter of the book in my head, I have not arranged it in the series and juncture of the particulars, so that I can tell before hand what will come next. My pen moves almost involuntarily, from the mere habit of writing; like people that speak without being aware of what they say. And this unconcern arises from a consciousness that I have no harm in my mind, and therefore there can come none out; I mean, actual and intentional harm. If the maxim is true, quod non habet, non dabit, I can give no offence to any one, for I mean none. For notwithstanding all that has been said, or suspected, I never had a single individual in my mind, in characters I have drawn, but have been dipping my pen simply in the inkstand of human nature. If any man sees himself in this glass, tanquam in speculum, it is his own fault to put his face near it. For, it is not my intention to put the glass to him. I will acknowledge that a principal object with me is amusement, and I would hope to keep it innocent, if I cannot make it useful, and I do not see why it may not be considered as having the like chance for this, with the fable of Menenius Agrippa about the belly and its members; or any of those which are called Æsop's, under the similitude of beasts, and birds speaking. But be as it may, if we should miss the mark, all that can be said, is, that if we mean instruction, we have but an aukward way of conveying it. But call it even our own amusement alone that we have in view. it is a picture of human nature, from childhood to old age; from the baby-house to the laying out money in bank stock; or the purchasing land for which the owner has no occasion. It all goes to engage, and employ the mind, whether it is throwing a long bullet, or drawing up an address to the President of the United States. Our hands must be employed, or our minds.— And this I take to be a great cause of the restlessness of a man in society, or out of it—the activity of the mental powers. And in proportion as a man has less or more of the vis inertiæ, in that proportion is he locomotive, or stationary. Thady O`Conor had taken the benefit of the insolvent act; nevertheless he was an honest man, for he had nothing that he did not surrender, never having had any thing to surrender, unless his brogues in Ireland; which though they might be considered as still his property, yet they were not in his possession, having fallen from his feet, as he made his escape from sheep stealing in the old country, and so left behind when he came to this. He had imposed upon the captain of a vessel, by telling him that he was a nephew of general Washington, and would have his passage paid for him three times over, the moment he arrived. But no president Washington, or any for him, appearing to claim him as a relation, the Captain was at a loss what to do with him, and while he was deliberating, Thady made a shift to do something for himself; and making his escape from the vessel, had been some years sojourning in the country, and at last got into jail, from which he had not found it convenient to escape, and so paid his debt with a ticket as the phrase is and being liberated by due course of law, he set out for the new settlement, of which he had heard. He was for a new constitution, and swelled the squad of malecontents with the administration of the government. He was chosen for a convention, as soon as it had been agreed upon, that there should be one. FRAGMENTS. WHAT is the reason that there is usually more talent in a new settlement than in an old? Is it the fact? That would lead to a discussion of some delicacy, in our republic, and induce comparison, which, according to the proverb, is odious. But there is doubtless some ground for the assertion, that our best generals, and ablest orators in congress, have come from the west, or been of the new states. As to generals, Harrison, Brown, and Jackson might be mentioned. As to orators, we have had Patrick Henry, of a frontier in Virginia; and I might mention one of my own name of Kentucky, though he spelt it Breckenridge as my father did; but thinking him wrong I altered it, because I found the bulk of the same stock spelt it so; and particularly doctor Brackenridge of the philosophical society in London. Clay, Crawford, &amp;c. of the congress in later times, are examples. But supposing it the fact, can I assign the cause? It is sometimes accident. Sallust in his introduction to the Bellum Catalinarium, asks, How came it, that the Roman state rose to such eminence, the Greeks being before it in arts, and the Gauls in valour? Reflecting on the subject, he resolves it into the circumstance of a few great men having arisen in it. Nevertheless, though it may be sometimes a matter of casualty, yet it would seem to me that it cannot well be otherwise, but that in new countries the human genius will receive a spring, which it cannot have in the old.— But the cause lies deeper; and in this, that the strongest minds, and the most enterprising, go there. They are thrown upon the vigour of their own intellect. Why is it that subterranean fire bursts from the earth, but because it has an energy that breaks through obstructions, and ascends to a higher element? The plodding cub stays at home, while the more active tatterdemalion, quits his paternal roof, and goes to build a cabin, and make a new roof for himself, in the wild woods of Tennessee, or elsewhere. The same elasticity and spirit of mind, which brought him there, gives him distinction where he is.— The independence of his situation contributes to this; fettered by no obligation, and kept down by no superiority of standing. Why is it in the arts, that an age of great men cannot but be succeeded by an inferiority of powers? This holds true in poetry, which is the province of the imagination. Why did the slaves, on a certain occasion, defy the swords of their masters, but yielded to their whips? It was owing to the subjugation of habit.— People accustomed to feel superiority in a certain way, are discouraged in their efforts. The streams of a new country are more abundant, and the springs burst more plentifully. This is owing to the shades which hang over them; which not only render their margins and fountain heads more pleasing, but serve to protect from the exhaling heat, and conciliate dews, and the moisture of the clouds. Hence it is, that it is greatly blameable to cut down the trees about a spring head; or, if it can be dispensed with, the grove on the hill above. For these wonderfully contribute to preserve the abundance of the current; and the perennial flow. It is for this reason I was delighted with the cascades of a new country, tumbling over rocks; because when one thinks of bathing, there are mossy banks to strip upon, and deep shades to embower, and conceal from the nymphs. For one is not afraid of any one else there, unless, perhaps, a young girl looking after cows, who would not much mind it, being used to see people without much covering to their carcases, nor much caring whether they have any. For it is in cities and the abodes of luxury and false taste, where we depart most from the simplicity of Eve in paradise, who “Clouted Adam's grey breeks,” or pantaloons, when he had a pair. I feel the grandeur of these water falls, and at the same time have a sense of the salubrity of the immersion. For I take the application of cold water to the body in hot seasons, to be not only pleasant, but wonderfully medical. The effusion of cold water removes heat, and by the direct action which we call a shock, braces the system. The visionary philosopher having put himself at the head of an institution for teaching beasts, had collected sundry of what he thought the most docile animals. He had in his academy, as it might be called, under scholastic discipline, a baboon, a pet squirrel, a young bear, and half a dozen pigs, &amp;c. &amp;c. The squirrel, as in the case of young masters, with the sons of rich people, he encouraged, or coaxed, to get his task by giving him nuts to crack; and the pigs, by throwing them rinds of pompions, or parings of apples; the bear and the baboon, in like manner, by something in their way; and so with all the others. Some he intimidated by the ferule and the birch. He was instructing them according to the Lancastrian mode, or method, to make marks on sand, and to write before they began to read. Things were going on very well to all appearance, and to the satisfaction of the tutor, when a catastrophe which now took place brought the matter to a conclusion. It was not from the lady who had brought the pet squirrel to be taught, though she had expressed some impatience at the favourite not making a more rapid progress, because she was sure it had genius. But she had forbidden the professor to use the rod; and what ground could she have to expect a close application, and a quickness of perception without a stimulus to the mind, by the feelings of the body? However, it was not from the lady taking away her scholar, or that of any of the other employers and subscribers withdrawing their rabbits or other students, but from that wicked fellow, Will Watlin, followed by Harum Scarum with a switch, who, breaking into the menagerie, exclaimed to the professor, or principal; it is not of much consequence now which he is called; What, said he to the master of the hall, is it in imitation of your pupils, that you are here in your bare buff? Sans culottes, have you nothing to cover your nakedness? Had you put yourselves in your sherryvallies, or overalls, there would have been some decency.— Every thing is French now-a-days. Is it French that you are teaching these to speak, or write? I see a baboon there; Lewis, I suppose is his name. He will learn French fast enough, if that is all you have put upon his hands. He was a Frenchman as far back as Arbuthnot. The squirrel may chatter something, and it may sound to us like French. Do you mean to make the bear a parlez-vous? Vol. IV. N No wonder that the two John Bulls, senior and junior, the Old and the New England, should talk of French influence. Do you expect your pigs will be made officers under Bonaparte, interpreters, perhaps? I would have you know that we have too much French amongst us already. If the French should come over to us in an oyster-shell; for I do not see what else they have to come over in; and this they could not do, unless like Scotch witches, there might be some use in currying favour with Napoleon. But is the discipline of your school correct, even if there was something to be taught that would be of use, in science, in agriculture, or in commerce. Do you instruct them in history and good breeding? To keep their persons clean, to pare their nails, and shave their beards, those of them that are grown gentlemen? That fellow there, the racoon, does not appear to me to have had his beard shaved these two weeks. It is true, I do not see any of them with a cigar in his teeth, like the American monkies and opossums, the greater part of them of a bad family education; and so farewell. But that mongrel between the terrier and the pointer breed, with a collar on his neck, may be said to have a collar without a shirt to it. I am tired of these remarks; away with you, away. With that, Will Watlin drawing his watlin, and Harum Scarum using his switch, they began to lay about them. The monkey leaped; the pigs squealed; the squirrel chattered, and ran into his cage; the bear growled; the pointer howled, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. The education was thus interrupted, and the institution broken up. The bog-trotter complaining of neglect; alleging his services at the original establishment of the government in trailing a pine log, and thereby intimidating the populace at his coming to the settlement, the governor was constrained to give him an office; and selecting one for which he thought he might be, in some respects, qualified, he made him an auctioneer. It could not be said that he had not a pretty strong voice; and in knocking down an article with his mallet, “once, twice, tree times,” with the assistance of a clerk, the sales were pretty rapidly effected. Occasionally he made a blunder, as knocking down a frying pan, and at another time a brass kettle, he rung too long, because the sound pleased him. He alleged that a hive of bees had swarmed, and he was wringing to get them to cluster. All agreed that he made a pretty good vendue master; but still he was not satisfied; and an ambassador being about to be appointed to the Barbary powers, he was willing to go to Algiers Tunis, or Tripoli. His friends favoured his pretension, Thady O`Connor, and some others, who had an expectation of accompanying him; Thady as secretary, and others in different offices. The governor resisted the application on the ground that one office was enough at a time. His resignation even would not justify it; because it would look as if there was a penury of men of talents, when it behooved to take one from his duty, as if another person could not be found who was as well qualified. The junto, and Teague himself, spoke of the appointment of John Jay to the court of London, while he was chief justice, not resigning; and of Ellsworth, also a chief justice, in a similar situation; and of Albert Gallatin, who was secretary, and continuing such; yet maugre all the clamour, and even good grounds, as Jefferson and Madison, and others thought, he, the said Albert was appointed by the said Madison to an embassy. These things were all wrong, said the governor. I do not mean the finding fault, but the doing that with which the fault was found. Could Washington do wrong? said a stickler on the side of the bog-trotter. Yes, said the governor, and Adams too. These were the bad precedents that Madison followed. I shall not copy after; not questioning but that these treaty-making people might be very capable, or perhaps the most capable; but were they the only persons to be found that were adequate to the task? I will not say but that my bog-trotter might make a very good ambassador, with instructions, and the advantage of a secretary; but is Teague O`Regan alone, in all the land, to be singled out for this trust? After searching the whole country from Dan to Beer-sheba, can I find no other that can sustain the weight of this negociation? If I do appoint him, he must resign his place as auctioneer, and does he know that the Algerines are Turks? and if he goes there, I mean to the Barbary coast, he must be circumcised, and loose— Loose what? said Thady O`Connor. I will not say what, said the governor; but you may guess. There is more effect in a hint, than when the story is spoken out; and therefore Thady, and the auctioneer also, their imagination outrunning their judgment, and their fears their ambition, concluded it would be best to stick to the hammer, and for Teague to remain a crier of vendues, and Thady O`Connor clerk. I have often thought, that if a president of the United States in our time, had a Jewish prophet to denounce to the people, their political transgressions; that is to say, the swerving from the true faith; in other words, his own party; how much more secure his standing would be; how much less vexed by the calumny of editors, and paragraphs in gazettes. Among the Britons, the aborigines or early inhabitants, the druids, did not denounce much; but what they lacked in speaking, they paid away in acting; and a disturber of the government being pointed out by these, it was not long before he was in an ozier creel; the Simulacra contexta viminibus, and his breath extinguished by the flame. Would it not have been possible for president Madison, for the $50,000 paid to Henry, to have secured as many of the New England clergy in his favour, as would have made them act as druidical priests in support of his administration? I cannot, say I would wish to see the wicker basket introduced; but I was thinking of the effect of the practicability of establishing something that would be in lieu of it: that is, the influence of the priesthood; but not in the same way. Pulpit denunciations have a prodigious effect to the eastward. It is no wonder that the religious functionaries of that part of the union have made a noise, both before and since the war. If they really believed, and it is possible they did, that Bonaparte had transmitted several tons of French crowns to the United States; finding that none of them came their way, what wonder if they became dissentients to the war? Madison should have made a point of securing at least a majority of these congregationalists. It was upon this rock the witches split, in not having secured Cotton Mather, when they made their descent upon New England. The consequence was, that an uproar was raised against them; and they were hanged, and drowned, till the people began to be satisfied that there was not a witch left; and for a plain reason, because there never had been one. If the people were not satisfied at this, yet certain it is, they ought to have been—so saith the writer of this book. But I will not take a bible oath upon it, that there are not John Bulls in that quarter, as true as ever crost the ocean, and were imported to this country. Take the individual man, and how difficult it is to form him. Between the boy, and the man it is the most difficult to govern him; from the time, that the voice begins to break the treble of the puerile age to the counter of that of manhood. Here we have to do with the confidence of feeling some power of mind, and the insolence of inexperience. It is the same with men in a state of society. A constitution has been framed; it is impossible to convince them that they cannot make a better. The young, as they grow up, despise what has gone before them. They are sanguine of temperament, and take it for granted that the world has never seen such a creature as they are, before. That whatever errors others have committed, in the like situation, they will have the judgment to avoid. It is not until by disappointment, and the vexation attendant upon it, that they can be brought to know themselves, and to rate their natural talents, and their discretion at a lower estimate. A man must be forty years of age, said lord treasurer Burleigh before he begins to suspect that he is a fool, and fifty before he knows it. It is on the same principle that an individual must have lived a long time in a republic before he can be a republican. Some have gone so far as to say, he must have been born and brought up under a republican government, to have the habits and way of thinking of a republican. Rollin, I think it is, who says, he must at least have lived fifty years before he is fit to be trusted with affairs. N 2 There is more in age as a qualification, for the right of suffrage; or the right of delegation, than in that of property REAL or PERSONAL. The longevity of our republic will depend upon there being an amendment of this nature. Young cocks should never be heard to crow in the senate house, or young whelps to bark. It is true the Scripture says, “Bray a fool in a mortar, and he will not be wise.” All length of time and all experience of consequences from his own errors, will not correct. But he must be a fool indeed, an idiot, that will not derive some advantage from what he has seen and suffered. When a member has made a speech in a deliberative body, of some hours continuance, and finds that he grows no taller in reputation, and which he will, in due time discover, he will not be unwilling to abridge his ventriloquy on other occasions: for I call it ventriloquy; it deserves no better name. There were two Raneys here, some years ago, ventriloquists. If we had them in congress to imitate jay-birds, and amuse the members, till a decent time had passed to let the question be put, it might be an improvement: I say a decent time, because appearances would be saved, and as we on the bench have an advisari vult sometimes out of courtesy to the counsel as if the argument on the wrong side had nevertheless puzzled us, so civility to adversaries is not altogether lost, by affecting to think the matter not just as plain as a pikestaff: you may conciliate, and gain attention when you are wrong yourselves, that is when they think you wrong. There is no moral truth, the weight of which can be felt without experience. What do I mean by moral truth? I mean that which depends upon the nature of man, and is the foundation of his actions. Who would comprehend without feeling it, that it is of all things the most difficult to govern men? The most simple way, and doubtless the most effectual, is the same by which you would govern a beast; the bridle and the whip. An individual at the head of an organization may command millions, and keep them in subjection: but in this case, no one can be allowed a will of his own, to the smallest extent. If the two legged thing that calls himself a man under such a government, should attempt to speak or act for himself, off his head goes, scalp and all, and there is an end of the disturbance. There is one way, which is to let the multitude alone altogether, and then there is anarchy, or no government. If you let them alone, it does not suit very well, for in that case, they rob; and there being no security, there is no industry; and consequently no improvement in the arts, or amelioration in the condition of man. If you undertake to restrain their passions, how will you go about it; but by force or persuasion? Persuasion will go but a little way with a man that is hungry to hinder him from puting his paw upon whatever eatable there is before him. It must be, therefore, force. All government must be therefore founded in fear. It is but a conceit in Montesquieu, to found a republic upon the principle of virtue; a monarchy upon that of honour; and a despotism upon that of fear. Fear, is the foundation of government, of man, as much as of a horse, or an ass. The great secret is to govern him, not just as you would a beast; but by the fear of suffering a distant evil. The reason and reflection of a man can comprehend this; that of a beast not so much. What we have seen in this new settlement, is a picture of the credulity, and restlessness of man, and his constant struggle to break through that organization of power by which he is restrained from that to which his passions prompt. He will endeavour to break through, by talking of changing the modes of government. But it is not the mode, but the being governed at all that displeases him. A constitution is that organization by which a man is governed by rules that apply to every individual of the community; and from which no one is exempt, but all bound to obey. This is what is called a republican government. The changing a constitution begets the desire of change, and like a dislocated bone, must produce a weak joint. It ought to be some great defect that would justify a change. The one half the effect of laws or general rules, is the being acted under. It injures a saddle horse to put him in harness; because he must change his gaits. The governor had acquired considerable authority over this mob, by the intimidation of scalping, and I take it he will speak in a more decisive tone, and act with proportioned firmness in the future exigencies of the commonwealth. Fraud is sometimes called, pia fraus, because it is a deception of the people for their own good. But fraud is not admissible, but on the gound that they are in a temporary phrensy, and not in a condition to hear reason. A book entitled, Incidents of the insurrection in the western parts of Virginia and Pennsylvania, in the year 1794, gives a picture of a people broke loose from the restraints of government, and going farther than they had intended to go. If that book was republished at this time, and circulated in the Eastern states, it could not but contribute to shew the danger of even talking of a severance of the union, or an opposition to the laws.— The bulk will take one another to be in earnest in these matters, when individually, they never thought of carrying the project farther than talk. It is not a want of understanding that prompts dissatisfaction in this part of the republic, but a want of self-denial, and humility. Doubtless it may be said that Virginia, though she has ore of a good quality, has wrought her mine too much, in protruding presidents; and there is no intelligent man, but will approve of an amendment to the constitution of the United States, to remedy such engrossing in time to come; but they will support the administration, since it is the will of the majority for the time being. An error in the expedient, and this could be considered only an error in what was expedient, is a small matter compared with a violation of principle. Opposition to an administration, is an error in principle, and may lead, though not intended by the actors, to the destruction of the machine. If, in giving a picture of a Hartford convention, in the narrative of the proceedings of the new settlement, I should, in due time, have a convention here too, I will have no chaplains, because it looks like a burlesque; and it would be ten to one, if the governor could keep Teague O`Regan from being one of them. If the people would insist upon it, how could he help it? The Reverend Teague O`Regan, I presume, he must then be called, to give the greater solemnity to his function; but this very designation would but increase the farce. I wonder what business our legislative bodies, of the individual states; or governors, or congress, or presidents have with proclaiming days of festivity, or humiliation which ought to be left to the societies of religious denominations. It savours of hypocrisy for the temporal power to interfere. CHAPTER IX. THADY O`Connor found a cousin here, Tom Snilloch; a cousin by the mother's side, a half breed. He appeared a good deal bloated; which besposke high feeding and intemperance in drink. The history of this man was singular. He had been an oastler; or, as it is spelled, ostler, and pronounced hostler, to a counsellor Otterborn a man of great eminence in his profession. The counsellor having to go to attend the courts for some time, and taking his horse with him, Snilloch, who was left behind, had no currying to do. But not willing to be idle, he took possession of the office, and the counsellor's books. The clients calling, he passed for a partner and gave advice and took fees. The counsellor returning, he set up for himself, and said he had studied at the temple, and practised in the four courts of Dublin. Business fell into his hands without seeking it, and every one that had a suit in court were anxious to engage lawyer Snilloch. He took care not to write out opinions; for it was not a clear case, that he could write. But he was what you call an off-hand lawyer; and though his oratory was not very intelligible, yet it had much pathos, and was said to be accompanied with the action of Curran. It was not astonishing, that he ran away with the whole business from the old counsellor, whom he affected to undervalue and despise, as one who could speak nothing but common sense, while what he said was real law, and had nothing to do with sense. By de holy fader, he would say, every man can talk sense, but de law is de ting. So it was that his reputation grew; and though what he said, was as unintelligible as a Delphic oracle, yet the response was as much respected. He purchased lands, though I cannot say he paid for them: he bought a house; married a wife; set up a carriage; and had the judges to dine with him when they came to the circuit, and sometimes to sup. Who but the great counsellor Snilloch! He might alter, or withdraw records; make affidavits for his own use; no question being asked in the case of a man of such high standing in society. All that the poor counsellor, Otterborn, who was left starving, could do, was to turn poet. This he did, and consoled himself with writing a ballad upon Tom. As a specimen of the border minstrelsey of this time, we give it here. A BALLAD, TO THE TUNE OF “I sing a song of six-pence, A pocket full of pins.” TOM RASCAL, OR RASCAL TOM—A BALLAD. I sing a song of rascal Tom; Tom rascal, do ye see; And when you meet a rascal man, Just sing the song with me. This Teague not many years ago, Came with his broguery, From Dublin city, where he had been, Before he cross'd the sea. What had he done, or what had not, No matter, for he's here; He said he was a lawyer bred, Which look'd a little queer. But no one ever doubted much, He had been at the bar; Though what his standing there had been, They did not know, nor care. But if he was a lawyer bred, He had not read the books; And scarce could make himself a pair, Of hangers and pot-hooks. No matter what his learning was, Nor what his share of sense; He had what did to set him up, A stock of impudence. Nor did he let his talent sleep, Or in a napkin hide; But put it out to usury, With fortune on his side. No more he'll trot by Allen bog; Bog-trotter there awhile; He has a better trotting place, The Alleghany soil. Some say he has a tract or two, He now can call his own; No more beholding for a place, To shake his brogue upon. Not as it was in Dublin town, And many such are there; Where, had he stay'd, he might have gone, To shake a brogue on air. Was it by pleading, that the 'squire, Made out to make his jack? As well you might expect a cow, To give you latin back. The ways are more than one, you know, The mower whets his scythe; But how to whet it, there is none Can tell until he try'th. No matter how you money make, Provided that you make: The less you have of character, The less you have at stake. I only dread that those may hear, The luck, and cross with speed, From Dublin or from Drogheda, To overstock the breed. So have I seen a vermin hous'd Soon followed by a score; And what will be, we best can tell, From what has been before. Lavater had a happy knack, Of telling to keep clear, Of such as might impose themselves, Like Monsieur Braganeer; Cou'd read the faces, and take a hint From brow, or lurid eye, And made a book, and called it, of The physiognomy. He seem'd just like a famished bird In snow time, when he came; The people gave him oats to peck, And many were to blame. We thought he had a partridge track, But he turn'd out a crow, Or harpy, in old times the bird That plagued the people so. I wish I had an Ovid here, To change him to a bat, Provided that he had no wings, To keep him from the cat. For some have been transmogrified, And are not what they were; Vol. IV. O If he was made a whip-poor will, The change would make him stare. When Don Quevedo was in hell, He saw two devils busy, In carrying in a rogue or so, And here and there a huzzy. But saw two others fast asleep, And had been so full long, With cobwebs overgrown their mouths, The rubbish there among. They had been lawyer-carriers once, No use now for the elves, The lawyers of the later date, Come fast enough themselves. I wish these devils were awake, And had a mind to come; I'd give them more than they would ask, To carry off our Tom. A gally-nipper could be spar'd From the musqueto race, And the extinction of a fly Would make the evil less. But nature has her lurking views, In breeding many things, The use of which we do not see, Or why she gives them wings. The very sky itself has got A scorpion and a crab; As you yourself may ascertain, By help of Astrolabe. But why allude to similies, Or metamorphoses, Or caricatura that we hate, Of his immortal phiz. When circuit judges come to town They'll surely taste his wine, And were he even Cerberus, Would not refuse to dine. But such the world in which we live, And such the state of things, Republican the government, Or under mighty kings, The worthless will have countenance, The worthy be depressed; Which having said, enough is said, So let the matter rest. But Tom has eat and drank so much, And guzzled so much wine, That em bon point, as Frenchmen say, It makes his visage shine. His dewlap it hangs down like clout, Or wallet under chin, Would do to make an apron of To put his luggage in. His goitre is not from the air, Or water we have here; And guttling that gives him a throat, And dewlap looks so queer. The case has ever been the fact, Since Brutus did exclaim, Virtue I have followed thee, But found an empty name. Nay, long before, it was the case Since Lumeck was a lad, For all you got by being good, You might as well be bad. I grant you may not go so far As matter that will hang, But any thing just short of this, May take within your fang. The judges supping with the great lawyer Snilloc, who had made an immense fortune at the bar, had this ballad recited to them; Tom himself producing it, as the effusion of that contemptible mortal, counsellor Otterborn. The judges laughed immoderately, and shook their sides; because, when a person is at the table of another, it behooves him to laugh at what is thought ridiculous. Snilloc anticipating the judges, who might hear of the ballad, thought it advisable to bring it forward himself as a good joke. But these things did not last always. Tom had recovered money that he could not pay over; he had contracted debts that he could not discharge; and in his dealings was found to be a rogue. People began to suspect that it was not for building churches that he had left Ireland, especially as he had not discovered much inclination to build any here. He became insolvent; and the alternative was to go to jail, or, as the phrase is, to cut and run. He chose the latter; and was now with his cousin in these woods. CHAPTER X. WILL Snickley had come to these woods, a short time before Tom Snilloc. Snickley had absconded on account of a duel in which he had been second, and in which the principal was killed. For though not valiant himself, Will Snickley, could be the cause of valour in other men. Not altogether destitute of ingenuity, and where he had to do with a simpleton, sufficiently successful, this Snickley attacks an unsuspecting man in the Gazette; whom he advises to cowskin the Journalist. It is done; and the Journalist challenges. The unsuspecting man declines, because the Journalist had shewn himself a blackguard. But that the unsuspecting man might have no excuse, a red hot Irishman is prompted to offer himself, as no man could dispute, but that he was a gentleman; Snickley in the mean time offering himself to be his second. The unsuspecting man could not well tell what to do, and was under the necessity of accepting; and being in love with a young lady, took her brother, a young man, for his second. It was proposed that an apology should be made which Snickley drew up, and couched in such terms, that it became impossible for the unsuspecting man challenged to adopt. Snickley took care to have the Irishman's pistol loaded skilfully, and having the first fire, shot the unsuspecting man dead. So much for seconds; who, from what little I have seen of the matter, if not the instigators of the duel, are seldom without blame in not taking due pains to compose the difference. A man of sense, and humanity, in the capacity of second, will insist upon an investigation of the cause of quarrel; and if the actor who has called upon him, is in fault, he will dictate his apology accordingly. The seconds on both sides being thus disposed; and I assume it that on both sides they are men of sense and humanity, a contest of this nature, will never terminate fatally, and seldom without a reconciliation. I own it to be, in most instances, the weakness, or wickedness of seconds, that occasions it to happen otherwise. From my own experience, I could give a hint to a young man just going into the world, that in all probability O 2 would save him from being challenged, or being insulted, and reduced to the necessity of challenging himself. This does not consist altogether in having good pistols, or practising with pistols, and having the reputation of a good shot; for this is what is known to every one, as a preservative against the injuries, and insults of Ruffians. But the secret I would communicate, is, the concealment of your dislike to duelling, or the being principled against it; for on letting that out, every villain will be endeavouring to make what he will call a character, at your expence. He will insult, or challenge, believing that this may be done without risk to his carcase. A surgeon of the British navy, happening, after the revolutionary war, to settle in the same town with me, and being intelligent, I cultivated his society, and conversation for some time. But hearing him declare himself a duellist, and the little hesitation, he would have to give, or accept a challenge, I thought proper to draw off, and to avoid as much as possible, occasions of being in his company. This he appeared to feel very sensibly; and addressing me, wished to know my reason. I stated candidly my apprehensions of giving him offence inadvertently, some moment when I might be off my guard; and that as I must count upon a challenge in that case, I thought it prudent to forego the pleasure of his society, for my own safety. I will tell you, said he; I am a small man, and not of great bodily strength; and did I not hold out the idea of fire arms, I could not protect myself. But I will let you into the secret; I am the arrantest coward on the face of this earth, so that you need be under no apprehension from my duelling. It is all to keep those that are stronger, from knocking me down, that I affect courage. Snickley did not stay a long time in these woods. He returned to the old settlement; and the matter blew over. Party supported him; family connections gave him countenance, the ladies danced with him; Judges supped; he was elected to office; became director of banks; and is in a fair way to be — — just what he pleases. I will acknowledge that I have no idea, that Snickley, when he projected this duel with the unsuspecting man, had any idea of the ultimate catastrophe; or that death would ensue. There are so many chances in favour of a wound, that a wound only was contemplated; and the pistol was loaded upon the same principle that a gaff is put upon a cock, by young men of silly minds, who take delight in such barbarous amusement. But I would not have the compunctions of Snickley, for all the sensation of present pleasure, that he derived at the time from the contrivance of the tragedy. Teague, though a fool, had more of a certain sort of sense, than the unsuspecting man. For being told by one of these that take delight in exciting duels, that he had been slandered by a racoon, calling him an opossum, and was advised to challenge the racoon, as there could be no avoiding the calling him to account: Master racoon, said he, may tink me an opossum; and de opossum may tink me a racoon, and call me so; but de racoon, and de opossum may settle it between demselves two: you may tell Mr. Racoon, dat I would just as soon be called an opossum as a racoon. Dey may tink one anoder gentlemen; but dere is not a hair's difference between dem, except it is as to de colour, or de bulk of it. A blackguard will always have de last word; dey may call me opossum, or racoon. If dey could say any worse of me, dey would do it. And it is a good joke dat each tinks de oder, noting more dan a vile baste. Dey may talk deir slander, and publish deir papers; but it is all de same ting to Teague. CHAPTER XI. THE visionary philosopher, notwithstanding the want of success which attended his speculations, had still great weight amongst the people. I mean, his opinions had great weight; for though a tall man, he was not of great corpulency. It had been suggested that it behooved to impose taxes for the support of government. What? said the philosopher, have you not got a constitution; and cannot a constitution work without taxes? At all events, what is called an impost may suffice. An impost; what is that? said a man amongst the crowd. Why, an imposition, said another, what else could it be? Impost, has nothing to do with imposition, said the philosopher. It is to knock down a man when he comes into the settlement, and take his money from him. The English have what they call a pol-tax, or a tax upon scalps. It cannot but raise a good sum from the red people, who take so many from the whites. In some governments they tax boots. Would it not be better to lay a tax upon legs, as being more easy to be collected, and less liable to evasion? said an honest man. Of all taxes, said one in answer; I think this would be the most easily evaded; because a man could run away with his legs. Robbing people that come into the settlement, will not do, said one; at least for a permanent revenue; because it will keep people from coming. I am against all constraint upon ourselves, or any one else. I propose voluntary and occasional contributions. You propose a fiddle, said his opponent. Voluntary, and occasional! Do you conceive a man could spare a pound of flesh, or an ounce of blood, occasionally, for any great length of time? He might bear the first slash that he got; but he would wince at the second. Loans, loans, said a financier; you have nothing more to do than to borrow a million now and then, when you are out of money. Why, if robbing pedlars will not do, said the Visionary Philosopher, I think loans must be the next resort. A pretty noise we have made about a constitution, said a smart looking man in a pair of leather breeches; if there must be force constantly applied to the wheels; and money expended to keep it going. How can a machine go unless it be wrought, said a man with a sloutched hat, without some to work it; and how can it be wrought without hands? I mean persons hired for the purpose; and if hired, they must be paid. I do not know, unless you apply steam, said an ingenious mechanic. Would you make the government a steam boat? said one in a bear-skin coat. But supposing it the case; you must have coals to boil the water, and produce steam. At this point of the game, a simpleton came forward, and spoke as follows:—Gentlemen, said he, I am but a fool fellow, a mere ass, a sheep, and what not; but I do not see how we can borrow, unless we expect to pay; and if what is borrowed is to be paid, why not pay in the first instance? That will not do, said an artful member; we will be turned out, if we lay a tax; the people must be cheated by our borrowing in the mean time, and leaving it to those that come after us to lay a tax, and pay. What use in having a general financier, said the multitude, if he cannot make money out of chips and whetstones If nothing more is to be done, than to count the money, or cast up the tax when it is paid into him, any cod-head may do that. A financier may do a great deal more than that, said an intelligent person. He may determine and report upon what a tax may be best laid, and to what amount. But if we hesitate to tax at all, I grant you, any body may be a financier; for it is an easy matter to borrow, if you can get any to be fools to lend without funds to sustain it, and at least, pay the interest. But why borrow when a man has money in his chest? I would call for this; every man his proportion according to his property, just as we subscribe to an undertaking; and the only difference is, that, in this case, we subscribe what we think we can afford; in that, we contribute what the community shall think we ought to advance; the community, through some organization of officers, and these being the judges. “Put yourselves in an attitude and armour for war.” What is this but to raise money, which is the means of war? It did not mean to clothe yourselves in sheet iron, or in bull's hides; but to go to the bottom of the matter, and to lay a tax to support a war. No difficulty in procuring soldiers for a campaign, if you have money; no necessity to call upon militia; you will have enough to offer their services. It is money makes the mare go. Give me money, and I will shew you men; and when I have the men to shew, there will be no war. Aye, said Teague O'Regan, give me de boys, and a shilelah, and I will clear de fair. If you will give me de money, I will get de whiskey; and if I have de whiskey, I will have de boys, and let me see who will like to come to blows wid Paddy. This speech pleased the people much; and they insisted upon the Governor to place Teague at the head of the finances. It is more than probable he might have been advanced to the head of this department, the Governor yielding to the solicitation of the people, had not the popular voice propelled him in a different direction. For about this time it was reported that he had taught a cat to speak. It is true, that as he had seen done in Ireland, by taking the lower jaw between his finger and thumb of the left hand, and pinching her upper jaw with the finger and thumb of the other hand, moving the lower jaw, in the mean time, as she mewed, he would make her pronounce something that resembled the saying Erin go bra, which was Irish; and by another kind of movement, and breaking of the voice, it would seem to be, bacon, fat bacon, which was English. From this specimen, it was thought that if put at the head of an academy to teach beasts to articulate, he might succeed better than any had yet done. He was called principal, and being made a Doctor of laws, was put at the head of the institution. But it took more time to teach the principal, I mean the bog-trotter, to make him mark and write something like L. L. D. at the end of his name, than it had done him to teach the cat; and if you had not known that it was L. L. D. that the letters ought to be, you would have been at a loss to know what they were. It is necessary that a man in a station which bespeaks learning, be a Doctor of laws; but it does not always follow, that he be learned in the laws; at least I have known some that are not the most profound scholars, on whom this degree has been conferred. To make the bog-trotter a Doctor of laws was some advance; but, it would be more to confer that degree on one of his pupils, a bear, or a young elk; at least it would occasion more surprise. The Visionary Philosopher had made out a system of rules and regulations for the government of the academy; in other words, the discipline of the institution; such as conditions of admission, price of tuition, grade of classes, freshman, sophomore, &amp;c. books to be read, hours of study, and vacation; meals, kind of food, with matters that regarded decency of manners, such as that squirrels should not crack nuts, or pigs eat apples in the school rooms; nor racoons chew tobacco or smoke segars. It was particularly inculcated on all, that they should rise early, wash their snouts, comb their hair, and pare their nails, as becomes a student. All things were arranged for this menagerie; and a proper number of the more tractable of animals got together to begin with, such as young cubs, whelps, &amp;c. when it was put into the head of the Principal, by some of the more high minded of his countrymen, that it was a degradation to have it said, that an Irishman was teaching beasts; to be called a horse professor, and the like. Whether it was that the pride of the bog-trotter took alarm at this, or that he saw the ridicule himself; he threw up the trust, and would have no more to do with it. The people were dissatisfied, and his popularity fell as rapidly as it had risen. Transit gloria mundi; There is nothing so fleeting as sublunary joys; and of all these, popularity is the most evanescent. It was but a short time ago, which was the occasion of the bog-trotter teaching the cat, and having succeeded, that he was caressed by the multitude, followed, chaired, &amp;c. but it so happened that the chairing took place in a small cabin; and when he was raised suddenly, those hoisting, not having due regard to the height of the story, he struck his head against the ceiling, or rather rafters; for there was no ceiling; at which the Latin schoolmaster exclaimed, “Sublimi feriam sidera vertice.” But what gave him more consolation, was the having a dinner given him, the Chief Justice presiding, and toasts drank. For it is not in our time as it was at the Olympic games, or a Roman triumph, or ovation, that an oak leaf, or a sprig of laurel, or a bunch of ivy, a branch of olive, or some other unsubstantial vegetable was the gift. In modern and more improved times, we have solid food of flesh, and sauces, to gratify the palate. Certain it is, the bog-trotter had been feasted abundantly during his popularity; but now on the ebb of this, he had declined so far in reputation, that he could not have been made a constable. So fortuitous, and unstable is the popular voice. Whereas heretofore during the current in his favour, things were imagined to his advantage that he had never done, and words framed that he had never spoken; so now the reverse took place; speeches were framed it is true, but they were all to his disadvantage; as for instance, that he had said the moon was made of green cheese; that a snake was a vegetable; that the only conversion with the fanatics was the turning the heels where the head should be; that he had reflected on the general government, saying that gun boats were only fit to make Virginia hog-troughs; that an embargo was like yoking pigs where there was no fence; that borrowing money only became a young spendthrift, who was afraid to apply to his father or his guardians; that there were faults on both sides, weakness on the part of the administration, and wickedness on the part of the opposition. These allegations might be all true enough; but he had not the sense to make them; but being down, every thing must be heaped upon him. An editor of a paper, who had boasted he could write down any man in six weeks, opened his battery; charged him with tumbling, and bog-trotting, and shaving himself with a bad razor; some things frivolous, and some things false; but it went to compose a paragraph. There was no standing this. The bog-trotter was at a loss what to do; whether to withdraw from society, and take a hut to himself in some corner of the settlement; or to quit the country and to live amongst the savages, and wild beasts, when a mere accident gave him some countenance in the community. It was reported that he had found a stone; and doubtless he had, for it was an easy matter to find a stone on a piece of ground which had been once the bed of the river; and these stones also round and lubricous; but it was suggested to be what is called the philosopher's stone. This hint, some wag had communicated to the Visionary Philosopher, who went immediately in quest of Teague. The truth is, the stone had something singular in its configuration, and was perhaps a petrifaction. The Philosopher, though somewhat irritated at the Irishman's desertion of the trust in educating beasts, yet as it is natural with visionary men, was struck with this new idea, as what might be turned to account in making gold and silver in the present scarcity of specie, the banks having refused to issue any for their notes; and adopting a conciliatory address, he bespoke the bog-trotter. Teague, said he, I am not come to take you up, not being an officer of justice; nor having any thing to do with the matter of your teaching beasts; for it has occurred to myself, that if taught to speak, and sent to congress, they might gabble like magpies, and the remedy would be worse than the disease; so that I came, not displeased with you, on account of your relinquishing the tuition; more especially as you have found out the means of replenishing the national treasury, by this stone that has fallen in your way. It is a desideratum in chemistry that has been long sought after; and if Redheiffer had turned his attention to that, instead of the perpetual motion, it would have been better for the public. For though an editor made a demonstration of it as plain as a problem in Euclid, yet some still doubt the fact of a perpetual motion being discovered, except in the tongue of a member of congress. Have you made any silver out of this stone yet? I should like to see a little of it. I have made a pewter spoon, said the bog-trotter, and dat is de next ting to silver, and a lead bullet, and a piece of copper; but de spalpeens have robbed me o' dese, and took dem out o' my pocket whilst I was aslape, and no body de wiser for it; bad luck to dem, de shape-stalers, and tiefs. Come back with me to the settlement, said the Philosopher, and I will make a man of you. Dat I will, said the bog-trotter; and see de Governor, and shew him de stone. The stone was shewn to the Governor, who was glad to see the bog-trotter again; but had no faith in the discovery. He knew Teague to be such a liar, that he could give no credit to what he averred. The stone, said the Governor, is a very pretty stone, made by the rolling and tumbling of the water, in one part, and breaking off in another; or has been originally a piece of wood, cut by a joiner, and is petrified; but I would just as soon take a stick to make gold, as I would a stone. A stick to hold in one's hand and compel a robbery, would Vol. IV. P be as efficatious as a stone; and this is the only way that I know of making money, suddenly, which cannot be done, unless you have some one to rob that has money. The Philosopher with Teague, appealed to the people, and reported that the Governor was averse to the having money made. The only remedy in this case was, the threatening that they would turn him out and put Teague in or the Visionary Philosopher for Governor. With a view to this, and to refresh his popularity, a dinner was once more given to the bog-trotter. The toasts were, Down with paper money; gold and silver the genuine circulating medium, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. When the bog-trotter retired, a volunteer was given: “Our noble bog-trotter.” CHAPTER XII. THE governor, wearied out by this folly of the people of his government, and being somewhat in a passion, at a meeting of the legislature, instead of sending a message, came in, and with a speech made the welkin ring. For it was out o doors that they were convened, not having yet built a state-house; and being a man of very powerful lungs, like some of your warriors of antiquity, or Shelby of Kentucky, in modern times, and mounting a stump, on a rising ground, the heavens his canopy, he raised his stentorian voice. “Good people, said he, I care no more about my popularity with you; or whether I am again to be chosen governor or not, than I care whether you are fools or knaves; it all comes to much the same thing; for in both cases, you mistake your own interest. If this fool fellow, Teague O`Regan, that has been one day popular with you, so as to be fit for any office, and at another day not fit to be your hangman, has found a stone, which this politician, the visionary philosopher, gives out as having the virtue of transmuting metals, and changing wood or shells into gold and silver; if this ragamuffin, I say, has found such a stone, which I no more believe than that my horses' hoof has the virtue of changing the earth that he treads upon, into gold; what good would it do you, when the very thing that makes such metal precious, scarcity, would take away all use, or benefit of it? If you would make gold and silver as plenty as bank notes, would it be of more value? Do you take me for one that, for the sake of keeping my place, would consult a temporary popularity? I tell you that I will have no more teaching beasts to speak, sing, or whistle: no more coining money, by philosophers stones; or discoveries of perpetual motions, or any such stuff. Your philosopher may teach you to catch crabs in a new way, or to open oysters; I look to what will establish the government, and render it vigorous; taxation, and no borrowing from Jew brokers, like minors that have their estates in expectancy. Does the heart borrow from without; or does it not take back the blood from the extremities, which it has circulated to them? It is a cheat and deception of the people not to tell them truth— “Si populus vult decipi, decipiatur,” Said the latin schoolmaster. No, said the governor, they shall not be deceived by me. I disregard their caucusing, and talking of taking up another candidate for governor They may have my bog-trotter, or the visionary philosopher, when they please; and they may impeach me when out of office, or let it alone: I am at their defiance, having acted to the best of my judgment, for their true happiness. Do they take me for a coward in politics, that am afraid to touch their pockets, and apply to a philosopher's stone, even if it had the virtue of making gold, when the making gold or silver, would do more harm than good? “You may have my bog-trotter, and welcome, for a governor; I am pretty well tired of bothering myself with him, to make use of a phrase of his own; I have had as much trouble on my hands with him as Don Quixotte had with Sancho Panza; and I cannot but acknowledge, as some say, that I have resembled Don Quixotte myself, at least in having such a bog-trotter after me; save that Sancho rode upon an ass, and this O`Regan trots on foot. But I hope I shall not be considered as resembling that Spaniard in taking a wind-mill for a giant; a common stone for a magnet that can attract, or transmute metals. It is you that are the Don Quixottes in this respect, madcaps, and some of you from the madcap settlement, Thady O`Connor and several others, tossing up your caps at every turn, for a new constitution; not considering that when a thing gets in the way of changing, it will never stop until it gets to the end of liberty, and reaches despotism, which is the bourne from whence no traveller returns. Do you take me for Jefferson? You are mistaken if you think I have so good an opinion of you. I would ill deserve your confidence if I made your whims my guide; or regarded popularity obtained in such a way. It never came into my head that, because I had got the chair of government, there was a millenium about to come, when all men would do justice, and there would be no occasion for judges and lawyers; nations could be coerced by proclamations; and no war would ensue. Your philosopher's stone will stand you in little stead if an army is to be raised and a fleet supported; and without an army and a navy, are you safe within or without? Not while you live in a country where there is a water on one side and savages on the other. John Bull will come by the water, and Tecumseh by the wilderness. A navy is the safe defence of a republic where it must, or at least, will have commerce. It always rallies round the government, and not faction. I want money to support a navy and an army, and this I will have, not by a philosopher's stone, but by drawing on yourselves; and when you cannot pay, then borrow; but lay yourselves to the wheels, and see what you can do first. “The mischief is, you have too much money, and hence it is we hear of banks in every quarter, depreciating the medium until a paper dollar comes to be an oak-leaf; and if you were to make silver as plenty, it would be the same thing. I will have none of your philosophers stones, I will put my veto on it. “The priesthood have young John Bull, I mean New England, under complete subjection; because they alarm them with the idea that but for them, the clergy, the witches would be let loose, and carry them to the red sea. Now, I neither wish such subordination, or by such means; but I tell you the truth, that I will resign the government, and go about my business, bog-trotting as I used to do, with some new waiter, if I should leave Teague upon your hands. I neither know nor care, but I should not be surprized, if some of you should have your necks in the guillotine, before a fortnight; (and here he gave a description of the guillotine.) This happened in the French revolution, and it will happen with you, if you give way to your reveries. I will abdicate this moment. I am off; and I would not wonder if some of you had a guillotine about your necks before the morning.” At this, descending from the stump, and making as if about to go off, a great dismay fell upon the legislative body, and the multitude without. They had a confused idea of the matter threatened, but could not well conceive what it was. Some thought it was at least a hanging matter that was to come upon them; but all apprehended some bad consequence, there having been a rumour of philosophers in France having brought the nation to much suffering, by guillotines; the royal family having fallen victims to this mammoth kind of execution. They P 2 began therefore to intreat him to retain his place as governor; and even hinted at a resolution to guillotine the bog-trotter. It was moved, and seconded, and passed nemine contradicente, that the bog-trotter should be guillotined. The visionary philosopher afraid that in this turn of the public mind, he might also be guillotined, fell in with the current of the popular opinion, and said he was for the guillotine; that he had a model of one in his pocket. It was the fact, he had a model, not in the least expecting such a result of things; or that there would be any occasion for a guillotine; but merely as the model of a machine that had been in use, at a distance, but not introduced here. I have, said he, the model of a guillotine, pulling it out, and, I take it, with the help of a carpenter or two, I could have one constructed of a proper size for the bog-trotter in the course of this evening. Resolved and seconded, that a guilletine should be made, and that the bog-trotter should be executed at ten o'clock the next morning. I would just observe, said the governor, that the guillotine has fallen into disrepute in France. Deportation is the modern manner of disposing of the criminal. And without much time lost, it may be perfectly convenient to carry a deportation into effect. Here is a tin cart of one of these young John Bulls; I mean one of those carts that carry tin-ware, watering-cans, and cullenders. You can make use of one of these for deportation from the country, not that I can spare my bog-trotter from digging potatoes, but here is Thady O`Connor, a loose fish, that can be put into it. No sooner said than done; Thady O`Connor was taken up and put into the cart. CHAPTER XIII. CONTAINING OBSERVATIONS. IN some things in the above, I may be considered as having a fling at president Jefferson, in the article of not looking at the nature of things, or judging nicely upon them; though, I will acknowledge, that in some matters I erred with him: approving of an embargo, and not seeing until a late day, that the policy was ineffectual. I approved of gun-boats to some extent, and may do so still; but, not so as to supersede a navy, which was the error of the president; though, if I recollect right, it was the project of Thomas Paine. It is natural for a person to think what he would have done, had he been in the situation of another, even though he never had the idea of being in that situation. But having an interest in common with others in the management of the helm, it becomes more essentially natural for one to think what ought to be done; and it is not an after thought with me in saying that I saw the first error of the Jeffersonian administration; and this was in the attack upon the Federal Judiciary, which was a cingulum to bind the states; the belt of Protagoras, to keep together the bundle of sticks which had been so well arranged by the constitution. The next error was the repeal of the excise and the stamp duties. The people had become reconciled to the excise, and I do not recollect a single petition for a repeal. The objection to the stamp duties was founded in a prejudice against the name; because the Britons had had such an act, and had attempted to enforce the like upon these colonies, on the principle that the parliament had the power, as was declared, “to bind us in all cases whatsoever,” and this without representation in that body. It was an objection also, that it was not productive to a great amount; the remedy for which was to increase the duty: it was a mode of taxation the best that was ever devised. It fell upon the monied men, and the poor paid little or nothing. The next error was, the not continuing, or reviving the direct tax, and to a greater amount than before; not upon improvements by building, and on windows, &amp;c. but upon the value of the soil, and the proportion holden by any one. What would I have done with the revenue arising from these? I would have had a navy augmented by this time to fifty ships of the line, an hundred frigates, and two hundred sloops of war, with brigs and schooners in proportion. These things are not an after thought with me; for I can vouch the new president, the then secretary of state, James Madison, that in Philadelphia, in the summer of 1805, I stated to him all these errors; and as a consequence of these, the paying tribute to the Barbary powers, when with a navy which we might by that time have had, we could have burnt up their towns like wasps' nests. It was upon these grounds that I have said a thousand times, that Jefferson, so far as respected our interior arrangements, was not a great commander. I saw it before he was three months at the helm of government. My idea of his talents upon a great scale had been high; but they were lessened. But it is only with regard to the management of the interior, that I had applied the dignus regnandi si non regnavisset. I was always with him in his apprehensions of John Bull; and I deplored his errors only because he left himself in a situation to invite the horns of that madest of all mad cattle Good fences restrain fencebreaking beasts, and preserve good neighbourhoods. All idea of the nonsense of French influence, I have ever rejected from my creed; nor did I go so far as to be of opinion that Bonaparte had usurped the government in France; for there was no government when that man took the helm; so that if he did usurp it, it was only as respected the Bourbons, and not as respected the French people. There was no government in France at the time he took the helm; there anarchy, the guillotine, and despotism. The people were ready to “call upon the mountains and the rocks to cover them.” But the now Elba emperor deserves the contempt of the world, also for his want of true wisdom, and his injustice with regard to Spain, Russia, Holland, &amp;c. &amp;c. As to his conscriptions of the French people, it is nothing more than our militia laws. It is ridiculous to call in question the principle; but the use that was made of it. This chapter, when the scenes have passed away to which it refers, may be struck out, or omitted in the subsequent editions of this work. CHAPTER XIV. INCLINATION prompts me to give some account of the locus in quo, as the lawyers say, or the place where the Governor had pitched himself; I say pitched, which is a metaphor from the pitching tents by an army. It is expected that I am to describe the situation of the hill above, and dale below; shade of tree, or falling fountain by the house. Will it not be proper that I first describe the house itself; which I do not mean to do minutely; because I have no idea that it will stand many years; but that he will get a better, as the country improves, and saw-mills erected. What can be expected from early settlers, but the choice of a situation? and every thing is not always made with the best judgment. For it is inconceivable by any one who is not acquainted with it, how little of the ground can be seen, and particularly explored, while it is under wood. The best situations will be overlooked; or, if they are seen, some less superb is chosen with a view to present convenience of water, or vicinity in some other particular. It was not such a mansion as would hurt the pride that is natural to the mind of man; and might lurk in the bosoms of other early settlers, not so well lodged themselves. I do not know that the builder had thought of the uneasiness occasioned to Valerius Publicola, by the loftiness of his dwelling on the Velian eminence. But his mind not running upon superb edifices, he had thought only of convenient accommodation. The simplicity of his taste was at a distance from every thing of shew and splendour; so that, not from the reflection of a wise precaution, but from the natural disposition of his mind, he was satisfied with a structure that could not affect the less opulent. But what it wanted in grandeur, he endeavoured to make up in taste, if that can be predicated of a building where little cost had been expended. Taste there was, in having it in such a style, that it would not have occurred to any one that taste had been thought of; for there was no ornament, nor was there room for it.— For what ornament could there be bestowed upon an oblong in the proportion of one hundred and twenty, by twenty feet; the sides and floor of hewn logs, and the roof of split timber? What was it but a suit of rooms under the same cover, divided by entrys, or intervals, of ten feet transversely to the length; which had the appearance more of a range of barracks than of a farm house. The fact is, the humanity of the governor had intended it chiefly for that use, the accommodation of individual families for a night, in their emigration to a new settlement. It stood east and west upon a ridge of ground like a whale's back, with a stream on each side running in a direction contrary from each other, but falling into two sister rivers on the east and west, which joined their silver currents at a small distance, and in prospect of the building. As there was a suit of rooms, so there were stacks of chimneys on the north of the range, and these of stone, built strong to resist the tornados not uncommon in that country. These, with a cellar underneath the whole length, walled with stone, and the lower timbers of the building laid half their depth in the wall, there being but one story above ground, rendered the structure pretty secure from the most violent blasts of wind. Having given this outline, it may suffice. I shall say nothing of the subdivisions, because they may be imagined. Nor shall I describe the extent of level or of rising ground in view; or the bearing of the mountains at a distance; or the circling of the floods. What attracted my attention more, was a beautiful water fall in one of those springs that issued from the hill on which the mansion house stood. It was a perennial stream, and issued from a crevice in a moss-covered rock, with a current of about two inches in diameter. It was as clear as crystal, and as cool as the Hebrus. The projection was in its first pitch, clear of the rock, several feet, into a bason of pure white gravel large enough to bathe in, and shrouded with a group of wild cherry trees on the sides, but above with the shade of the tulip-bearing poplar, and the oak. The spring on the other side of the small dividing ridge, and towards the west, at the distance of perhaps one hundred feet, issued more abundantly, and fell from one ledge to another, but with some murmur of the current, as dissatisfied to quit the fountain. The new town, as it was yet called, stood in sight, and had begun to shew two streets of houses at the confluence of the two rivers, and parallel with each, with the public buildings at equi-distance from the banks; and towards the base of the right angle which the two streets formed. I shall say nothing of the garden grounds; for these were laid out but in imagination, save as to a kitchen garden, with such vegetables and essential roots as could immediately be cultivated and were the most necessary. The collection of indigenous plants, and native flowers, or sought from abroad, could be the object of a more leisurely attention at a future day. People were thinking more of cutting down trees, than of planting them, which may be a fault. For individual trees, as well as groves in some places, ought to be spared, in removing a wilderness. The depth of a native grove in a hot day, surpasses all description in the sensations that it gives. The power of art with all her skill can never equal nature. I think it a great pity that we have lost so much of the ancient mythology as respects the sylvan deities, such of them to whom no worship was addressed, unless in the figurative language of the poet, which we still use, but do not feel, as those who believed in the existence. It inspired a tenderness to rural scenery; and in sparing shades was favourable to taste. One could tell a rustic who had no conception of the pleasures of imagination, that if he cut down this or that groupe, he would have all the Dryads on his back; the Hamadryads would come to their assistance; the Oreades would not send him storms; the Naids would order the spring that furnished water to his reapers to be dried up. But now we have no hold upon him; and much pain has it given me to see a fringe of willows by the brook, or a semi-circle of trees on the brow of a hill, entirely cut away. Nor, is it only in matters of taste, that the settlers of a new country are, in most instances deficient. They have not the most perfect judgment in the use of the small means they usually possess to establish themselves. I do not mean to undervalue the good intentions of public bodies, in sending missionaries among the Indians, to teach the doctrines of supralapsarian predestination; but might not other funds be constituted to assist settlers in removing and in fixing themselves in a new settlement, and to instruct them in the principle of an agriculture adapted to the soil and climate? The thoughts of a scientific man of experience in agriculture, would be a great advantage in a district of country, to advise in the making improvements. Men of public spirit in some instances, have combined their own interest with the benefit of others, in improvements in a new country. Disputed titles are the bane of settlements in new districts: this is owing to a want of specialty in the original granting, or correctness in the laying out the lands. Would not the salus propuli justify in such instances, the settling disputes in a summary manner, by commissioners? Does not such a transcendental right of government exist in all cases? It is not enough that the rind of shrubs, or wild berries, and the juice of the maple, should constitute the principal part of the food of a settler for a time; that he should put up with the shelter of bark stript from the trees, for the first summer, but after he has cleared his ground, and has raised corn, his field is taken from him by an error of the survey, or the equivocal description of an office right. The soil of a new country is wet, the air moist, the winter longer, of course, in the bosom of a wooded country; hand-mills for a time must suffice, and every man must be something of a jack of all trades. He must be a worker in iron, and in leather, and in wood. Invention as well as industry, is requisite. But the principal defect, as in all other objects of human application, is the want of original thought, to adopt new modes to new circumstances. Things are rather done in this or that way, because they have been so done elsewhere, and heretofore. For this reason, I would wish to see missionary agriculturalists sent into the country; societies instituted for the propagation of agricultural knowledge among the people, and the relief of distressed inhabitants. There might not be just as many Indians brought into the pale of the church, but there might be more churches built amongst the whites on the frontier of the country. The establishment of churches in the frontier country, is not amiss; but on the contrary, deserves commendation, where the preachers employ themselves in explaining and inculcating the intelligible principles of moral duty; and even when they take up the time of the people in supporting or overthrowing the speculative opinions of their adversaries, it amuses the congregation. That institution is not wholly useless, which supplies amusement. It reconciles the labouring part of the community very much to hear the rich and the luxurious denounced as not likely to come so well off hereafter, having had their good things in this life. Cold, and heat, and fatigue are better borne under these impressions; Vol. IV. Q there is less murmuring in the community. In a political point of view also, religious institutions have their use. Obedience to the laws, is a christian duty, and the support of government is favourable to that settled state of society, in which alone any system of mental cultivation can be the object of attention. In the late commotion of the public mind in this new government, respecting the calling a convention to alter the constitution, we had an instance of what might be done by an honest open hearted clergyman, of good sense, among his profession. He had a few acres of ground to clear, by cutting down the timber and rolling it away; and for this purpose, made what is called a frolic: that is, an assemblage for labour, and a feast at the same time; the feast was in the fete champetre way; though they did not give it that name. While they were at work, the pot, which might be rather called a kettle, was boiling: for it was a large boiler which had been employed in making sugar from the maple tree, more like a kettle for distilling, than a pot; it suited extremely well to make the soup, or broth on this occasion. A pile of wood had been set on fire, and the kettle suspended over it on a cross beam, supported by a fit arm at each end. The maker of the frolic, the owner of the clearing, going forward, had told the men, as the truth of the case warranted him in doing, that as the female part of his family had not come out to the settlement as yet, nor would until he could get some shelter built and improvement made, they must stand cooks themselves. There were fleshes of venison, and beef, and pork, and some fowls, and vegetables, and articles of seasoning: each might put in according to his liking. Each did put in according to his notion of making broth; and like the wierd-sisters in Macbeth, they stirred the kettle, singing as they stirred, till the pot was boiled, and taken off the hanger, to assemble round and put their ladles in. Some thought the broth had too much salt, or pepper, or cabbage; others too little. The proportion of every article of fish, flesh, or fowl was found fault with by some one. My ingredient, said the master of the entertainment, is yet to come, that is a flask of whiskey; to which they all assented to have poured in. A ladle of the broth enlivened with the spirit, put them in good humour; and it was a safe thing to jest with them, and to slur good hints under the veil of parable. “Good folks, said he, being of an occupation which the wags in their humour sometimes call pulpit whacking, it is not difficult for me to strike a doctrine out of any thing, as easily as Moses did the water fall out of the rock at Meriba; and hence it is, that we are apt, even on common occasions, though not in the pulpit, to spiritualize. This I am not about to do at present, but rather, if you please, to moralize a little. We have a constitution, or frame of government, which has stood some time, and for any thing I can see, might stand a while yet. It was framed by men of great political skill, at least, great information; and it was with great deliberation that it was formed. It was not until lately that any one thought to disturb, and new model; and in fact to make another. Reform, is a popular word, and it is that which is chosen. But every one must foresee an entire overhauling. Now, as I would wish to see our young timber sawed into planks to line houses, or to make floors; or by hewing, made fit for harrows or plough beams, rather than erected into guillotines, I am for putting up with the constitution until we get our fields cleared, and our meadows made; until we look about us, and get time to think a little, lest going hastily about it we make it worse. For you see, in making this broth, where every thing was put in that any one said he liked, it was not savoury, until a dash of whiskey made it palatable— CHAPTER XV. IT may not be amiss, at this stage of our history, to mention that the governor had not yet been a married man; and it was not the death of his lady that propelled him to enter on an unsettled, and rambling way of life; as was the case with Sir Thomas Graham who, to relieve his grief for the loss of a beloved wife, sallied out with a regiment of English troops against the French, to kill all that he could. It was not the loss of a dear woman that had made the captain half mad when he set out with the bog-trotter, “In romantic method.” But it was a cause that had some relation to it; disappointments in love. These had happened to him frequently and from an early period. His first attachment that took a strong hold of him was about the twenty eighth year of his age. He had taken it for granted that it was a thing of course for the maid to affect coyness, and to be won with great difficulty. And hence it was that he persevered too much and too long; and when repulsed he bore it the more hardly, because he had not expected it. The effect also was produced, that in his advances to a future mistress, a very small matter discouraged him; in the same manner as a steed in a curricle, once baulked, will stick at a small impediment, and refuse to draw. For falling in love with another beauty, and learning that poetry was essentially necessary in a matter of love to a young person, he wrote verses, and presented them. The lady wishing to bring him to the point, affected to consider his madrigals as a burlesque, returned them to him, telling him that she had not expected such ridicule from a gentleman of his good breeding. The poor captain in the honesty of his heart took her to be in earnest, and never went to see her more. The third that he addressed; for a lapse of a long time intervened before he could muster resolution to pay his respects to any one; the third I say, that he addressed; or rather purposed to address, was a blue-eyed beauty, with black hair and a white skin, whom he took by the hand, which trembled so, that he let it go; and gave up his pretensions. The truth is, it was sensibility in the young lady; and her joy in the good fortune that she had to be addressed by one whom she prized so much. He mistook it for a feeling of horror at her situation. His next campaign was with one whom his heart loved but his reason di approved, for she was as handsome as an angel, but as ill tempered as Jezabel. He would have married her; but he was relieved by a richer wooer who made a present of a bread tray, and chicken coop to the mother; and having her good wishes, succeeded with the daughter so far at least as to gain her consent to matrimony. His last attack, to speak in a military phrase, was on the heart of a young widow, who would have yielded incontinently had he pressed his advances, but her little boy calling a gentleman pappy who gave him sweetmeats, he took it that the child had the hint from the mother, and that the other was the favoured lover. Considering the matter all over, he resolved not as the English novelists say, upon a trip to the continent, but a journey on the continent to dissipate his ennui, and recover himself from the softer affections which had obtained the ascendant. For a change of objects diverts the mind; and going to watering places cures love as it does the rheumatism; not that it has any other primary effect, than cheating the imagination of its reveries. The people of the settlement had built the governor a house. The mansion of his excellency, was spacious, and furnished with several large tables, and some long benches, but was deficient in one particular, a lady of the castle who might attend to household affairs, and receive company. His senate thought that he ought to marry. Having weighty reasons to oppose, he did not all at once accede to the proposition. The truth is, as we have seen he was apprehensive of a repulse. For he had laid it down from his own experience, that as some attract women, so others repel; and there is no contending against nature. But though of great candour, he did not wish to acknowledge, or profess the real motives which led him to hesitate; but rather to evade, and raise difficulties. The setting an example of matrimony for the sake of peopleing a new country, was suggested as an obligation upon every good citizen: and that it behooved every good man to see to it that he multiplied himself. To this he Q 2 replied, that he was not so sure of the truth of that proposition. That when we saw nature using means to put people out of the world by pestilence, and earthquakes, we could not be certain that it was the will of Providence there should be more brought into it. And as it is of no consequence to such as have not yet come into life, whether they ever come at all, he did not see that those who did not come had reason to complain of those who were but the negative causes of the non-existence. There was a subtilty in this reasoning which the people could not answer; yet they were not satisfied. It came to this at last that he was under the necessity of explaining to them the delicacy of his situation, that it did not become him, the governor of a republic, to compel matrimony in his own case, or indeed in that of any other; and that he had no reason to suppose that in any other way, he could obtain the hand of the inamorata that he might pitch upon. It seemed to the multitude a ridiculous idea that there could be any spinster in the colony who would refuse the hand of a man of station when offered to her. But that if there should be any one found so recreant, the voice of the people should compel an acquiescence: that they would send out through all their border, and find out a damsel for my Lord, the governor, as in the case of king David, Ahasuerus, and others that are read of in the scripture times. Appalled at all idea of constraint, he was disposed to try rather what might be accomplished by fair means. He had heard of the emigration of the Creoles from St. Domingo, which happened about this time, being driven from their own country, by the revolt of the negroes, some of these half mulattoes themselves; or what are called mustachees, and not being of the fairest complexion, and pressed by great necessity, might wish to match themselves with any person for a livelihood. Or, as another expedient, he thought of sending by a trader, a keg or two of whiskey, to the Indian towns to purchase a princess who could be reconciled, for a little calico, to relinquish her connections. But the people would hear of no Creole, nor savage, who would be running back like a pig that is brought from another settlement; or bringing her relations along with her of foreign manners, and attachments. They insisted on his issuing a proclamation to call in all the spinsters, and selecting one from the assembled; some Abisha, the Shinamite, or Easter; not for a concubine; for they would have no concubine, but to be the lady of his hall, in a decent manner, as became the magistrate of a christian people. His excellency could not reconcile it to himself to procure an assemblage of females by proclamation; as in that case one must be rejected, and another chosen, which could not but wound his own mind as well as that of the unsuccessful candidate; and he could not marry them all, even were they so disposed; for a plurality of wives, in modern times could not agree in one house, however it might have been in ancient, when women were better tempered than at present. Besides the accommodation of the country would not admit it. If he took two, some honest settler might be without one. To obviate the delicacy of a selection, it was suggested, the procuring a number to be got together under the idea of a spinning match, a thing well known in the country, and let the best spinner take the prize; or to draw lots, as marriage is but a lottery, which would be a way of avoiding all idea of a preference. That may do, said the Governor, provided that my man, Teague O'Regan, is put out of the way, or fastened up; for if they once see him, the matter is at an end; I shall get none of them to take a chance for me. But all things considered, it was thought the most convenient course to do, as others did; and without making any noise, to ride about the country a little to see the damsels in their hamlets and at their spinning wheels, in their virgin state and simple habiliments, with unadorned tresses. In visiting the settlement, his excellency admired much the spinning wheel, a piece of machinery which he saw in almost every cabin. The attitude of the spinster is unquestionably finer than that of a lady at the forte piano, or harpsichord; not altogether because it connects grace with industry; and charms imagination at the same time that it engages reason in its favour; but because the position of the body behind the instrument, and with a front view to the beholder, has a great advantage. The fact is, that a finely formed woman can be seen in no possible attitude, to more advantage, than at the spinning wheel. At the forte piano, at a side view, which is the best; for you cannot have a front view, but a side view only, the instrument being in front, you see but the profile of the face, and the person in an inclined posture, with the shoulder stooping, somewhat. Even the fingers, however lightly they touch the instrument, are not seen to more advantage, than those of the spinster when she draws the lint from the rock with one hand, and rests the other on her lap. I consider the Irish harp as but approaching the spinning wheel in exhibiting the person to advantage; but independent of connecting the idea of utility, figure to yourself this simple piece of mechanism, combining the circle with the triangle, in its form; the lever, the inclined plane, the axis in the principle of motion; the orders of architecture in the rounding of the pillars, from the turning loom; and the white maple stained in concentric circles of bright yellow, or scarlet die; the yellow by the rind of the shumack, and the scarlet by the pacoon root, gathered by the female hand from adjoining woods. The tripod of Appollo, made of ebony, may present a resemblance; but the trapezium, on which the foot rests, and puts in motion the machine, with the neat ankle, and morocco slipper, is not so easily painted to the fancy. But when you raise your eye to the auburn, or golden, or hair of raven wing; with a skin milk white, and a brow of jet, and eyes of the crystal blue; when you add to this the finger of Hebe, disporting with the lint; the chest of Juno, thrown back from the position; the cincture and the smile of Venus, and the vivacity and sense of Mnemosyne, you may have an idea of what I have seen of beauty, and loveliness of the use of this instrument. A woman, on horseback, presents her form to advantage; but much more at the spinning wheel. “And still she turn'd her spinning wheel,” is a part of an old song; and if we ever get our Don Quixotte married, it is ten to one, but it will be to a spinster. CHAPTER XV. WERE I to imitate the action of an epic poem, it would now be the time to give the history of the Governor, before he was a Governor, and had set out upon his travels; deducing my narrative from his early years. His ancestry also might be touched upon; but the fact is, as I have said, I know little about him prior to the time of his setting out; and still less of his descent, and pedigree. I should be better pleased if I had it in my power to give some account of the progenitors of Teague, as being a character of greater singularity; but that is not in my power. From his ambition for eminence, I should think it very probable that his descent was noble, and from some of the old Irish kings, if the heraldry could be traced; but, in the sacking of towns, and burning of castles in the civil wars in Ireland, and foreign conquests by Danes, and by John Bull, all documents of ancestry have been lost; so that we are at liberty to imagine what we please upon this head. Philosophers dispute with each other; but the divines all agree that we all came from Adam. If the divines are right, we are all relations, tag rag, and bobtail; kings, emperors, and bog-trotters. I am content to have it so; for it is a way of thinking, favourable to benevolence; and I do not know that I should gain any thing by the idea of there having been different stocks; for though I should get quit of some rascals, that have sprung from Adam, I might have others on my hand not much better. The truth is, I know nothing of my own ancestry, farther back than the year 1715, where a certain M'Donald did good service with his claymore at the battle of Killicrankey, under Dundee. He was the grand father of my father, by the maternal line. I mention him, because he is the only one I have ever heard spoken of as being a dead-doing man. My father's father, called out in a conscription of feudalists under Argyle, fell at the battle of Culloden; and this is all I know of him. It has occurred to me sometimes, that coming from a remote island, and an obscure part of it, I might feign an ancestry with coats of arms, as others have done. The bracken, or brecken, as it is indifferently spelled by the Scottish poets, is the most beautiful ever-green of that part of the island; and might furnish something towards an escutcheon. The brecken is introduced by Burns, as an ornament of Caledonia. Their groves o' sweet myrtle let foreign lands reckon, Where bright-beaming summers exalt the perfume; Far dearer to me yon lone glen o' green brecken, Wi' the burn stealing under the lang yellow broom: Far dearer to me are yon humble broom bowers, Where the blue-bell and gowan lurk lowly unseen: For there, lightly tripping amang the wild flowers A listening the linnet, aft wanders my Jean. Tho' rich is the breeze in the gay sunny vallies, And cauld Caledonia's blast on the wave; Their sweet-scented woodlands that skirt the proud palace, What are they? The haunt o' the tyrant and slave: The slave's spicy forests, and gold-bubbling fountains, The brave Caledonian views wi' disdain; He wanders as free as the winds of his mountains, Save love's willing fetters, the chains o' his Jean. The ridge, o' green brecken, would have done as well as the glen; for it grows on the ridge as well as in the valley, which is the meaning of the word glen, a narrow valley, overhung by a ridge on each side; and so lone or lonely; that is, wild and romantic, by the small stream murmuring through it. This is the origin of the name breckan, or brackenridge. But I am running off at a tangent, and wandering from my subject. Having nothing to say of the ancestry of the Governor, or of that of the bog-trotter, I must omit, or rather cannot accomplish the dramatic form of the epic, but must proceed in a prosaic way with the narrative, a parte post, and say nothing of the exparte ante. The Governor was thinking of a lady for his castle, or mansion house; but does not seem to have succeeded; for he remains yet unmarried. Teague, as we have seen, had been heretofore much in request with the ladies; and still more so from the late reputation of his generalship, and the display of his tumbling at the camp-meetings But the circumstance of his having taught a cat to speak, was against him; for no woman would like to have a tell-tale of such domestic animal. It would render it unsafe to have a cat about the house. CHAPTER XVI. HOW shall we account for this eternal babbling in our public bodies, which delays and confuses business? Can it be French influence? No. I have no idea that Bonaparte ever expended a single sous for the purpose of inculcating this tediousness, or loquacity. The French themselves are far from being a taciturn people; nevertheless I do not find reason to believe that it is from an imitation of the French orators, that this prolixity occurs. There was no great length of time taken up by the member of the constituent, or national assembly, when he ascended the Tribune. Some have thought that it was a proof of the hypothesis of Darwin, that men have been once magpies, and parrots. I am of opinion that it resolves itself into one of two natural causes, want of self-denial, or want of sense. I know there are babbling schools at the present time, as there were at a former period; debating societies among the manufacturers in towns and villages, as there is in Great Britain. In some of the New-England seminaries, I am told, debating and discussing questions is made a part of the academic exercises. Of this I do not approve, if the students are to take, one, one side, and another a contrary, to whet their wits; and to say what ingenuity prompts, without a reference to the truth, and a just decision of the question. It would vary the exercise, at least that, of the class each should propound a question in his turn on the science which makes the subject of his studies; and the one who explains best, and forms the soundest judgment on the question, and with the greatest brevity expressed, should take the prize. I would commend brevity and truth, not the diffuse harangue, with sophism and errors. This would lay a foundation of eloquence for a legislature. Something ought to be done to correct this logomachy, or war of words, and nothing else. The vox, et preterea nihil is at all times abominable. If those of this class will speak, let them pronounce the word whippor-will a reasonable length of time, and that may suffice. Whippor-will; whippor-will; whippor-will; imitating the sound of that bird, for a quarter of an hour, might pass for a speech. O, how I have wished for a gag or a muzzle, when I have seen four or five columns of a newspaper taken up with verbosity. I would take it off only on condition of giving a good instead of these. The fact is, an amendment of the constitution would be the reducing the ratio of the representation; fewer to speak, there would be less said. Many hands make light work; but this applies to bodily labour only, where a certain object is to be accomplished; such as the removing a fence, or cutting down a wood. Fewer members would do more in a short time; and perhaps would do it better; for though in a multitude of counsellors there is safety; yet if all speak there is delay. Could we not give a power to the chairman, or president of a deliberative body, to knock down a member, when he had seemed to trespass on the patience of the house. At any rate, he might be permitted to give him a wink, or a nod, which it should be understood as a hint to have done. But there is great difficulty in breaking bad habits; and there are some whose tongues, according to the expression of the poet, speaking of a stream, “Which runs, and runs, and ever will run on.” Things have come to such a pass, that I generally take it for granted, that the man who gives his vote, and says nothing, is the man of sense. Adonizabee, in the scripture, “had three score and ten kings, having their thumbs cut off.” Why did he cut off their thumbs? It must have been to keep them from writing out their speeches. At least I have been led to think that it would be a gain to our republic if Adonizabee had our members of Congress in hands a while. Vol. IV. R CHAPTER XVII. LOOKING back upon this work; for I do not know that I shall add any more; it occurs to me to reflect whether it will do good or harm. I cannot think it will do harm. It contains a good deal of moral sentiment, the result of my own reading, observation and experience; “All which I saw and part of which I was.” I have myself been of the bar; have had to do, in a canvass for elections; and have been of a legislative body; like all young orators, I have babbled as others have done. This day do I remember my faults; and if I were to go over the same ground again, I would make one word do where two were used. The fact is that I have spoken upon subjects I did not understand; and had an ambition to display oratory. In correcting the errors of ambition for place, or the mere display of powers, this book may be of service in a republic. It is a caricatura doubtless; but it is by caricatura, that the ridiculous is discovered. For this painting I claim credit; but I have more the useful in view than the amusing of the work. I will acknowledge that I value myself a good deal upon the performance. Any animal of the human species, with a mediocrity of talents, may come to be a judge, and may appear pretty well in a book of reports, provided he cites precedents; but how many are there in an age that could write such a book as this? And yet to my astonishment, it has not got up in the world as I think it ought to have. But a great deal depends upon having a felicitous introduction. When it comes to be published with drawings, or what are called cuts, it will look quite another thing to grown gentlemen; and will come into vogue, and be a stock book. I do not affect to be the first in this line of writing that has appeared in America. There is a New-England publication entitled, “the Cobbler of Wagram,” which I have never seen, but have heard of; and which, I would thank some of the New-England literati to procure for me. For though I have made some flings at our young John Bull, yet I have had in view, but a few persons of the present time,and as touching a political way of thinking in alluding to them under the appellation of young Johnny; but as to their literary standing, I have a high respect for them; and at the same time am sensible, that the great body of them are true men, and err only in particulars; and this, a good deal from the not having the helm in their hands. They will get it in due time, as much as will fall to their share. But they expect too much, and cannot have every thing their own way. A separation of the Union they never thought of; it is all in Terrorem; but such talk may lead to the catastrophe which of all people, as they border on the British settlements it concerns their safety most to avoid. When I say the states of New-England never thought of a disunion, I distinguish individuals, who, for ambition, and the hope of obtaining power from a change, may not talk, but think, of such a thing. I am persuaded, there are in those states, at this moment, a minority, perhaps approaching a majority, that are as much anti-John Bull, as any other part of the Union. This is said as explanatory of what may be thought otherwise from my allusions to young Johnny Bull. I call them young Johnny, because old England, is old Johnny, and they are New-England; and because there are some of their editors at least who advocate British politics, and call the war unjust. I do not say British interest; because it is not less the interest of Britain to yield her claims of domination on the sea than it is for us to resist them. If the war continues seven years, I do not wonder if we should burn London; at least then that we have it in our power to burn it. For I should be sorry to burn any thing, or kill any one. But, I will acknowledge myself an enragee against uncle John on account of the injustice of his claims, and the barbarities of his allies. I am confident there are few of the people of that island, who if they were to see a single scalp taken, as I have done, and hear the savage yell, would not have the same impression. The war in disguise upon the western parts of the Union, in furnishing with implements, not of agriculture, but of hatcheting and scalping, the Indian tribes, was a cause of war long before it was declared by our republic. The invasion, was justifiable only on the ground, and it was expedient on the ground, of interposing between the vendors of scalping knives, and the purchasers, the Indians. The love of gain propels all the measures of John Bull; I speak of the government. It is an inconsistency, and a calamity at the same time, that a people who have the character of humanity, generally, and bravery, should exhibit with regard to nations, a conduct so profligate. CHAPTER XVIII. A KEY TO THE PRECEDING. THIS will be found in the history of the times; and especially of that of the state of Pennsylvania. And indeed, I flatter myself, that it is not a little owing to this book, published in portions, from time to time, that a very different state of things now exists. I do not believe, there has been a single bog-trotter, as I may designate them, admitted by the American Philosophical Society, for many years past; at least I have not heard of any since Oric M`Sugan, the house carpenter, who did the inside work of a stable for one of the members, and was therefore admitted. In the winter of 1787, being then of the legislature of Pennsylvania, it was signified to me that I might be put in nomination, with several others, that were about to be balloted for, if I thought proper to skin a cat-fish, or do something that would save appearances, and justify the society in considering me a man of philosophic search, and resources. Enquiring who these might be, that had been nominated, and put upon the list, and not chusing to be of the batch, I thought proper to decline the compliment. It was this which gave rise to my idea of such a candidate as Teague O`Regan for that honour. Some time after this, when delegates were about to be chosen from the county where I resided, to frame a constitution for the United States, after the adoption of the federal government, I offered myself for this, as considering it a special occasion; but to my astonishment, and before I was aware, one of Shakespear's characters, Snout, the bellows mender, was elected. This led me to introduce Teague as a politician. An excise law, under the federal government, having been carried into effect; and, it being obnoxious in the western country, and excise officers tarred and feathered, as you would a sheep, or an Indian arrow, it was with no view, but to burlesque the matter, that I made Teague a guager, or exciseman; and being a sans-culotte; which signifies, — I thought, a pair of breeches, might not be amiss of any sort. R 2 Being in a public station from the year 1800, I had to pay the usual tax of obloquy to men in office, from Paddy from Cork, &amp;c.; and, paying more than I thought my proportion, it was natural for me, to think of my bog-trotter as one who would make just such an editor as some of these were. It was for this purpose, therefore, that it came into my mind to give him a journal to edit. It was a retrospection to a past period when a batchelor, and recollecting the competition of those whom I thought undeserving persons, that I was led to caricature their pretensions with the success of my bog-trotter. The fact is, I thought it might be of service to the young women in the choice of a husband, and save them from swindlers, who differed little from the quadruped, but in the horn and the hoof, which they had not about them. I have had individuals in my eye, in all these matters, no doubt; but I do not name them; because they are not worth naming; nor would the subject admit it. General strictures of human nature, is all that can be expected, in these matters. From the talents of some new editors of papers, who had never yet fleshed their maiden swords in a republic, but were from Ireland, Scotland, or England, and some that were from neither, but turf-born, in this country, the press came to daggers-drawing with the law. The types disposed themselves; 1, against the judges; 2, against the law, and finally against the constitution. They got help from partisans on all sides; and these establishments were likely to be blown up. Learning was decryed and it was no uncommon thing to hear members of the legislature thanking God “that they had never been within a college.” There is now a considerable reform of the public way of thinking; candidates for state trusts begin to value themselves for having been at school, and find their account in being thought able to read. It is not as it used to be, the enquiry altogether, whether a man be a plain unlettered person; or has had a tincture of the law to poison his faculties. There is now actually a lawyer a speaker of the senate. Heretofore you might have seen caucus-holding men at their wits end for some extraordinary kind of dunce to send to the house; upon the same principle, that the philosophers dig into the earth for a mineral, a science which is called Oryctognosy; or that they look for a shell on the sea-shore, or a beetle in the woods, to send to a museum. The enquiry now is by these caucus people in every county, not only who is honest, but, who is capable? There are said to be sixty-two new members in the present session; I cannot say whether in the two houses, or in one, the old having been left out; and this on the principle, that they had missed a figure in calculation, and read four for three dollars. In the courts of judicature, in this state, there had always been much delay; and this, in a great degree, owing to the length of speeches; and note-taking. What else but this book has put that down. Does any body now hear of much excess in harangues? On the contrary, there is the utmost precision of thought, and brevity of expression. Nor has it only been in forensic eloquence that there has been a curtailing, but in that of deliberative bodies. It is not from Pennsylvania, that those interminable speeches come, which we hear of on the floor of congress. Is it not to be hoped that, when my book gets a circulation beyond the state, and into other parts of the Union, a retrenchment will be perceptible in the verbosity of members from other places, and that quality will begin to be consulted, and the quantity reduced. I could wish a tax were laid upon the time taken up in a debate. Why is it that congress do not buy up an edition of my book, and distribute among the members? It would be of more use to them than the library of Monticello. If it lay with the President, I am confident he would not hesitate, had there not been so much said about the $50,000 to John Henry. The people of Pennsylvania are so sensible of the use that it has been in this state, that there is scarcely a parlour window without a MODERN CHIVALRY. Five booksellers have made a fortune by it; for I have never asked a cent from any of them for the privilege of printing an edition, save in this last instance, where a few copies have been stipulated for the amanuensis to whom I have dictated what has been added to the work, and this for the purpose of distributing to his uncles, aunts, and first cousins, as the members of congress do the copies that are ordered to be printed, of President's messages, reports of ambassadors, &amp;c. I have said that I do not know that I shall write more, though I have some transactions in my mind, that I could wish to Chronicle; and characters that might be drawn. I know, that after the present war, which, in the nature of things, cannot last always, an ambassador will be sent to England; and Teague may be a candidate. I can carry him it I will; but, in that matter, I shall hesitate, because I should have to take the trouble of presenting him after his outfit; and going through the ceremonies of an introduction, with which I am not so well acquainted. For though a great deal might be said in favour of a republican going from a republican government, being less in need of a knowledge of etiquette, like an Indian prince that comes from the woods; yet, as those who had preceded him. Adams, Jay, King, Pinkney, &amp;c. had not gone with their coats buttoned behind, but accommodated themselves to the dress, and the customs of the courts of Europe; my bog-trotter could not well depart from precedent.

      <field name="fulltext">APPENDIX. SOME scenes of the preceding had been written in the first instance, in verse as what might be the foundation of an American Hudibrass; but afterwards embraced in prose, in the general narrative. To diversify the entertainment, some of these scraps are given here, and which may be preserved as a specimen of what the work might have been in that way. To me the verse of Butler is not less pleasing than the prose of Cervantes; but though in my own opinion, my verse in imitation of that of Butler is not without some felicity of imitation, yet never having been complimented to the same extent by others, I thought proper to change my composition into that of prose; or rather to drop the continuation of it in verse, and to take prose, which was a more humble and might be a safer walk. The following is the XIth chapter, of the first volume, containing what respects the institution of the Cincinnati Society. CINCINNATUS. A POEM. WHAT time the States had settled peace With adversaries over seas, And troops disbanded, it seem'd good, To institute a brotherhood, Among the chieftains of the war, Of Cincinnati character, Who now laid by their arms and came, To seek an agricultural fame, On territory they had sav'd. For, as together they had brav'd, The toils of service, wish'd a tie, At least upon the memory, Of that companionship; hence 'twas, The institution came to pass, Of a society and badge. At first it did provoke the rage, Of several of the citizens, As not republican; and hence, When one of these in rambling gait, Came to a village of the state, With badge dependent at his bosom. It seem'd a singular rosy crozum, And drew attention and surmise; And every one that seem'd more wise, Began discussion of th' affair. A certain pedagogue was there, Did first accost, and ask'd the rise, And the intendment of device, And how he got it, when and where; Effigies of a bird of the air, And other such interrogatories. The Cincinnat who heard the queries, Explain'd the history of the club, And effigy upon the bob; Videlicet, that having fought, And put the adversar's to trot, Retir'd from war like Cincinnatus, And were about to plant potatoes; But first in memory of their warfare, And individuals did most care for, Had set up club and wore a badge. And what bird have you in the cage, Quoth pedagogue? Is it a goose, That you have chosen for your use? Or a wild turkey or a swan? This hurt the Cincinnati man— Quoth he, I will not say you mean, T' affront, and throw out with design, This sarcasm o the badge we wear; But 'tis an eagle of the air, And emblematical of power, As having dominion of the lower, Fowls of the stack-yard and grove; And hence becomes the bird of Jove, And is device upon the badge, Which you and other fools with rage, Decry and vilify and abuse, As being without sense or use; Because your ignorance is such, You cannot comprehend it much, The meaning of the hieroglyphic, Or motto that is scientific, Devis'd by scholars that were good, And authors of similitude. Quoth pedagogue, I own I saw It had a bird's tail and a claw; But never did so far encroach, To look distinctly on the broach Whether a grey goose or a drake, That seems to give himself a shake; But what resemblance does it bear To him of Roman character; Who wore no brocket at his button Or a remarkable escutch'on; But when had ended war and battle; Return'd t' his harrow and draught cattle, Without a goose-resembling bauble; Or other bird or beast, could gabble, A word of Latin or of Greek. But what the phrase it seems to speak? Relinquit omnia, servare Rempublicam; But quere, Had this same Roman much to leave? Or, would he not have laugh'd in's sleeve, T' have had these words applied to him? And you that are of modern time, Were in the same predicament, Before you to the warfare went. So that the point is not in this, From whence the eulogy takes rise, The having left an ox or two, Or an old horse with which did plough; But your returning to your place, When armies had been sent to grass; So that 'twere better you had made it, Nunc victor ad aratrum redit: Or some intelligible phrase, That would bespeak the proper praise, Which really did belong to such, As not ambitious over much, Return'd from victory and war, To till their ground, and take the care, Of stock upon their farms; but wore, No other ensign than before, With barbarous Latin such as this, Assum'd for the diagnosis. To him a certain clergyman, Did take upon him to explain, The meaning of the badge and use, Drawn from the hist'ry of the Jews; Said, he was an idolater, That from the eastern climes came there With native sparrow at his breast; Or what else bird it was express'd; Egyptian ibis or a stork, That did among the sedges lurk, In face of dictate that was given, By decalogue the law of heaven, Vol. IV. S Inhibiting the worshiping, Of graven bird or beast or thing; Or that he was a great magician, And dangerous on this occasion; For had a trinket of his own, And abracadabra writ thereon, With some infernal spell or force, Above a common Christian's powers. The Cincinnat enrag'd to hear Attack upon his character, Address'd him to the populace, Which were assembled at the place. Quoth he, though no great orator Experience being more in war, Yet sense of injury and wrong, May give me exercise of tongue; Enable me to tell my tale In way, perhaps, acceptable; Especially as candour hears, As is evinc'd by your drop'd ears. For well aware that public lies, Insinuation and surmise, Have got the start of me, I fear'd, I would not be with candour heard. It seems the thing has gone abroad, That I have image of false god, Hung at my breast; the effigy Of bird, or beast, or fish, or fly; Which idol grav'd in bit of gold, Like the idolaters of old, I worship, and put up a prayer; Tho' but a wild fowl of the air. Theologists have given rise, To this religious prejudice, As natural to every mind, To breed according to its kind; But nothing more dissimilar, Than that a soldier in the war, Should worship God at all, or beast, In effigy or shape express'd; For seldom worship the true God, Save when some danger comes the road Unless the Swearing by the Lord, Or zounds or zuks, or some such word, May be accounted reverence, Express'd to the Omnipotence; And therefore much less probable T' adore the visual beak or bill Of this small eaglet that I wear. As to idolatry am clear; For though know nothing more about, Religions that are set on foot Than a grey goose; yet catholic, Let all men worship till they're sick; Nor interfere with church or psalm, But be plain soldier as I am You that compose my audience, Are persons of superior sense, And can with others set that right Misrepresented by this wight, And save my hard earn'd character, And the good name I wish to bear. There was a citizen just by, Attentive to the apology. Quoth he; it may not be the shape Of bird or beast at which you gape, For sake of reverence or prayer; But to distinguish what you are; The only champions of the cause; It being not the truth; whereas Are many others that have fought, And taken the Hessian by the throat, And may deserve more solid praise, Than wearing that small thing of brass, Unworthy even of you that chuse, To have the ensign of the goose. Is't not ridiculous that one, Who in the service has been known, As champion of a sober cause, Which with it such advantage draws To the republicks of this clime, Should turn his thoughts to such a whim As savours of a ruder age, When every light-head wore a badge; And is no trophy or a spoil The warrior earn'd, upon the soil, But arbitrary honour made, By some one of the brazier trade; And is no special proof of worth; There are so many to hold forth, Pretension to the same devise? For the peculiar honour lies, In being distinguish'd in desert. Are you the only that have mer't, In revolution brought about? Or are there not amongst the croud, Some others that have just pretence; If not with sword, at least with brains, To patriotism in the cause? If not with arms they have with jaws In councils of the several states, Or by their writings in Gazettes, Rebuff'd the British power and force And militated with discourse; And many who have spoke and wrote, Have also on occasion fought. And there are victims of the cause, By operation of the laws; In favour of the general good. What think you of the multitude, Reduc'd by fluctuating paper, Estates vanishing like vapour, And brought to beggary and loss? For take the people in the gross; And all have suffer'd more or less; And so may claim by services, At least a bit of lead or pewter, As their deservings are minuter, And institute a club or so, For what they did against the foe, In their particular grades and places; So that the multitude increases, To an infinity of badges; The honorary rights and wages, Of the whole bulk of citizens. In this there might be share of sense, But the Cincinnat replied, As having more reason on his side. Quoth he, it is a small affair, If at the period of the war, We instituted this our club, To recreate us after rub, And wear a badge which some arraign As visionary toy, and vain; But is't not fancy that supplies, One half of things which are our choice; And all beyond the dress and food, Is but imaginary good? The cut, the colour of the garb Distinguishing the Jew from Ar'b; And all kinds of appendages, Of different tribes and nations dress Have their foundation in caprice; Not from necessity take rise. The savages that are untaught Do wear their honours at the snout; And nature sanctions the pursuit By giving feathers to the brute. The badge we wear is not a charm Of physical or moral harm; But forcibly doth operate, And in the human mind create A love of fame and dignity, By having this before the eye; As, in the British isle, a Star And Garter, is reward of war; And the St. Louis cross in France: In other places like advance: It is a small thing if from toil, Of summers sun and winters soil, Deficient in the stipend due, We wear a thing distinct from you, A trifling signet of our own, Which scarcely costs us half a crown Is there a law against the usage, Proscribing it as a surplusage; So that a writ of capias corp', Can have the virtue to disturb? If there is neither rule of nature, Or jurisprudence that can deter, And hinder us, why not go on, On the same principle begun? For though not great the excellence, Yet have there not been men of sense, Among the Romans and the Greeks, That wore such things about their necks? S 2 A bull or button at the breast; And yet the thing not made a jest, By persons that have talk'd like you? Quoth citizen, it may be true; And also in the modern days, There have been found out many ways, To tickle fancies of the fools. There scarcely is a king but gulls, His courtiers with appendages, (At least when he is moneyless) Proud of a feather that is red, Or blue, because they take't in head, It does them honour with the prince; But here behooves us to have sense, And real merit of our own, And not a mark to make it known, Hung up like sign at tavern door, Or barber's pole your nose before, Evincing that there is within, You could not otherwise divine. Besides, why do you quote the Greeks, Or Romans that had like dogs tricks? There is a difference in the case; For there the people's suffrages, Bestow'd the honour that was worn; But here it would not serve your turn, But you yourselves assum'd device. Quoth Cincinnat, the error lies In this; we took it up; but yet, It may be said the gift of the state, Because the honour was our right, And by deserving we came by't. Be that as't may, the thing is safe, And well befitting to the brave; And innocent in name and nature; Nor works a harm to single creature, T' offend a layman or divine. At this the clergyman hark'd in, Quoth he, have said, and say it again, The thing is heathenish and vain, And wearer an idolater, Of whom there is just cause to fear, Is some false prophet come to light As is laid down in sacred writ, That fell deceivers would arise, In the last days to blind our eyes, And draw us from the truth we hold; For as to that same bit of gold, What use? unless symbolical, Of something bad and magical, With rhyme that is engrav'd thereon? If the mythology was known, It might be found it was that gog,— And magog that has lain incog, So long in the apocalypse; And now emerging from eclipse, Has risen in such shape to men. The Cincinnat to him again: Quoth he, it ill becomes a priest, To travel from his sphere, and jest, About this trinket that I wear; Against it roaring like a bear, Who should be reasoning with the Jew, Wherever you can find a clue; Or with the infidel, about The devil's horn and cloven foot. Is this the knowledge that you gather, From every old and long dead father, As Chrystostom or Polycarp, Who on a different string did harp; Not meddling with our institutions, Instead of prayers and absolutions, And teaching from the catechism, The origin of faith and schism: Which is unnatural and absurd, Deserves to be chastis'd and cur'd? For have you not an ample scope; Or as we say enough of rope, To vent your rage and crudities, Against the errors that arise, Of fools that are propense to evil, And lay the fault upon the devil, As if he were a Jack o' lantern, In every whole and corner saunt'ring, Who never yet was out of hell, Or knew a single syllable, About the matter laid t' his charge, In pulpit oratory at large? I'st not enough to split your text; (Till every hearer's heart is vex'd) In forks and branches multiple, And firstlys, and so-forths at will, With heads and horns of Daniel's ram, That in the prophet's vision came; Or bring a sermon out of what Has scarce the semblance of a thought, By the reversion of the phrase; Or cloathing pristine nakedness, With commentaries of the brain, Which no man else can find therein; And have you not interminable, Career to run as fast as able, Through all the systems of the faith, And variations that it hath, Drawn from theology of schools, Or self-born of the preachers skulls, And built upon the abstract base; Which was originally much less: For so extensive is the flood, Of knowledge that is bad or good, A man may souse therein and toss, Just as in ocean would a goose, And find no shore or bottom out Of doctrines that are set on foot? Where then necessity to stretch, Your legs upon us at a fetch, As if you had not room at home To canter on your hypodrome, But must inveigh against what is But a mere symbol and device, And has no moral turpitude; Or meaning that is bad or good. And cannot give offence to Moses, Or hurt the decalogu's proboscis, Or you that are conservators, Of all that in religion stirs. Theologist—The matter lies Just here; the pagan deities, False gods in Egypt or elsewhere Did under some such shape appear; And even we read amongst the Jews They fell sometimes to this abuse; But chiefly worship'd calves and stocks; For which were given them rebukes. But paganism worship'd fowls, Eagles and pigeons and vile owls, Which you would imitate by this A sample of idolatries, And whoredom people did commit, And carnal sins in holy writ; And hence were banish'd from the earth Which gave the several nations birth, Of Canaanites, and after them, The Philistines that err'd the same; The Romans, Greeks, and other pagans, That had their Ashtaroths, and Dagons And worship'd bulls, and goats and heifers; And were your oracle believers; Which brought the curse of God upon them: And hence it is that there is no man, Who sees affection that you have For that which workmen did engrave, But fears a judgment for the sin, And wickedness that is therein; Deserving every punishment, That on the guilty can be sent. The Cincinnat was very wroth, At matter and the manner both, Of this retort; nor could restrain Repulsive motions of his brain, And choler; but essay'd to draw His hanger contrary to law And civil authority; when one Of cooler judgment looking on, Who was a great Philosopher, Though yet had made but little stir, Put by the blow, and thus bespoke; Quoth he, your hot-born rage revoke, Nor draw your sword upon the cloth, Because you are a little wroth; And without reason or just cause, At what has been thrown out; whereas, It is a general allegation, And turns upon the whole profession Of club, which has so broad a base It easily bears it, in this case, And is not personal alone, To you on whom the thing is thrown; And when a number are to bear The ignominy of the affair, It is as nothing to the whole. Have you Don Quixotte in your skull, And yet not recollect the speech, He made t' a town within his reach. Which had conceiv'd offence, because His Sancho braying like an ass; At which he was not any slouch; Did seem to say they were just such? He tells them that no word can strike Or hurt a body politic, Because the offence has no just base Of individual in the case. Are not the learned professions known To be a string to harp upon? We say that lawyers are all rogues, And preacher, that he but humbugs; And of physician, that he kills; More than he cures with his damn'd pills. And yet we have not on our backs, The whole of these like pedlars packs; For the physician, lawyer, priest, Laughs at the matter, as a jest. Why then enrag'd, at any one, For obloquy, that he has thrown, Just for a theme of his discourse, To raise a laugh among the boors? Do they who write your worst of satires, And ironies and all such matters, Possess a temper worse than others, Drawn from the nature of their mothers; Or just to shew their wit, at times, They scratch out paragraphs and rhymes; Attack the clergy, or the bar; Or with Hypocrates make war; Or chuse a country, or a town To be the subject of lampoon; Who laugh and read the ridicule; And only but a natural fool, Would take in head to fight or fence; Or 'gainst the slander break his shins. But where there may be some just base, Of obloquy, in any case, It more behooves to bear, as here, Where though the matter may be clear, You have a right to wear what badge, You choose; yet, there are who allege, It is a trespass to break heads; For though the man is pleas'd who reads, The history of achievement, yet, Not him who feels the blow on's pate. Unseasonable chivalry, Does not with modern times agree; Where law takes place of ancient prow'ss, And puts a stop to the abuse, Nor troubles knights to knock down cows; Or giants that have broke a house; So that it is unnecessary; The cudgelling an adversary, Especially a clergyman, Who has his privilege: again; Inglorious to make war with such, Not having honour very much, Of victory, when it is obtain'd.— There was a corporal by, hot-brain'd Who had been in the war, and fought; But no bald eagle, yet had got; Or was a partner of the club, Which military had set up; And took it much amiss that those, Who equally had fac'd the foes, Unworthily, were left i' th' lurch, To stand the back side of the porch, And though, were also at the must'ring; Yet had not at the breast, or postern, A thing, significant of this— For his part, he was wounded thrice, While that same officer that spoke, Had scarcely ever seen the smoke. But since he was so hot to fight, With Talmudist, no man of might, Had better turn to him a soldier, Would make his blood a little colder; And ease him of intemperate passion; Because the parson had some reason, And others, to find fault, and blame, The Cincinnat that left no fame, To th' common soldier, and the serg'ant But of your own accord, take charge on't And wear this honour as your own, Appropriate to yourselves alone. Quoth Cincinnat; an officer, Alone can have a right to wear, The emblem of the victory; Because there must be low and high; And what is better born and bred, 'Tis reas'nable should be the head. For what our nature makes the foot, Doth, in the inferior station, trot. As, in this very body of ours, We do not go, upon all fours; So, it is reas'nable, there should, Be a distinction of the brood; And those who have but little sense And lower quality of brains, Should occupy a sphere beneath. Is not the officer the head? When we gave orders you obey'd, So that 'tis proper you possess But the inferior grade and place; And have no badge or institution. The corporal felt his passion rushing.— Quoth he, have just as good a right, As you, though thus you did come by't To take to ourselves and wear a badge. The Cincinnat in greater rage. Quoth he, forsooth, because you fought, Where battle was a little hot, You claim the privilege with us, To be o' th' inside of the house, To have insignia at your breast! As well might an irrational beast, The horse that draws artillery gun, Or soldier had to ride upon, Put in for heraldry, because, Has sometimes been where danger was. What would you think to see a ribbon Or badge hung at his tale or hip-bone? A burlesque on your appetite, To have this matter made so light, Which were a proper ridicule When such a Teague O'Regan fool As you, would claim the establishment. The corporal's anger which was spent Broke out.—It was not proof of sense, Or other quality of brains, Quoth he, that fabricated one, An officer, and let alone, The other, that was just as good; But Congress, that was in the mood; For had a comrade, in my hut, That often made a common butt, Of those that were his officers, Who had as little sense as bears— And yet forsooth poor soldier Dick, May wish for honour, till he's sick, And get no knob or bit of ribbon, Hung at his bosom, or his hip-bone, As many of the cod-heads have, Who did not shew themselves so brave, In any battle that was fought. At this, the Cincinnat, red hot, Drew out his hanger, to shed blood, And hew down corporal, as he stood; Who forming front advanc'd his centre, As if he would the onset endure; Hence thought it best, t' accost him first, Before the matter came to th' worst. As Homer, when he wages battle, Between two of heroic cattle, He has a parley, and a speech, To know each other, which is which; And of what origin, they were; And, how the devil, they came there: Because, who knows, but they were cousins? So should not cut each others weazons; But, turn to other combatants: And even in the time of giants, And champions, throughout Christendom, Before they, hand to hand, did come, And actual clashing of the swords, 'Twas not unusual to have words; Though what was proper to be said, Have not at present in my head: Vol. IV. T But do, remember, very well,— What from our Cincinnatus fell. Quoth he, if, so preposterous, T' have also what they call a goose, Is your ambition, why not take, God's name! and hang it at your neck; Or at your breech, or back, or bosom; Or like a turkey-cock, at nose o' 'im? Some wooden peg, or pewter noggin, To wear it as you are a joging; Or copper ball, or piece of metal Inferior, for the common cattle; With something on it like a bird Or sign of poultry; whence infer'd, That you have rob'd hen-roosts, you rogue Or stole a duck or drake incog; When rations were a little scarce.— This seem'd to make the thing a farce; And a militia man just by, Who listen'd t' him attentively, Was angry, and began to frown, To see the soldier so run down. Quoth he, though but a common rat, I am, and you a Cincinnat. Great captain, that have spoke so loud, In your haranguing to the croud; And, though I know the soldier would Much rather have a fowl for food, And eat the wing or rib of goose, Than smell its picture at his nose; I take a part in his defence, Because he speaks the better sense; The undervaluing, you throw out Hits me, and others in the croud, Who being but militia persons, Who in the war have made exertions Yet have no right to wear the badge, As indirectly you alledge, By title and the club assum'd.— By this time common fame had drum'd The like ideas every where, Amongst the people that were there, With such exaggeration, as, Is natural in the like case; Videlicet, that the prognatus Who then was there of Cincinnatus Had ridicul'd the common people; As not of the state church or steeple; Calling them all scrubs and bodkins, And haberdashers, and such odd things: How that they ran away at York, And left the regulars at the work: And fled at Germantown and broke, From those left busy in the smoke: At other places turn'd about, And scarcely ever shew'd their snout, Where there was danger, or hot fire. One of the colonels that was higher, Became the spokesman of the rest; And rage now boiling in his breast; Quoth he, no doubt, we are but goats And scarce above the beast that trots, Compar'd with you, in what was done, And services you son of a gun; Tag-rag and bob-tail, doubtless, are Compar'd with vet'ran officer; Because we have not at our bosom That thing of yours, a rosy crozum; Are not embellish'd with a broach, At head, or neck, or breast, or crotch; A Latin motto or an ensign, Our toils, or services evincing; Being but a vulgar sort of whigs, That in the marches danc'd our jigs; Nor help'd at Trenton to take Hessians; Or fought like you, on such occasions; Or at the Cowpens, made good battle; And so are but a common cattle, And you alone sustain'd the cause, While we like bears at home suck'd paws; And cannot now advance a claim, To hieroglyphic of your fame. Quoth Cincinnat, the charge is false, And of the nature of all tales, Which contradicted, shew by proof, Intrinsical, what they are of. What? an American, by birth, Degrade the military worth, And lessen the deserv'd applause, Of my compatriots, in the cause, Of those who fought, in front, or flank, In regular or militia rank. My sentiments are the reverse; And never had in view t' asperse The signal honour you have won, In order to advance my own. These words had reason, but his voice Was wholly buried in the noise; And as the humour was with bat, And brick, t' attack the Cincinnat, His words could not restrain the mob, Or check the violence of hubbub. For when a multitude convenes To carry on some hot designs, They must do something, or seem slack, Of skill and courage, for the attack. So rushing discompos'd, the throng, Brought violence, and blows along: Here one uprais'd a ponderous stone; Another got a dead horse bone; Elsewhere, was seen, a block of wood, Portending to the knight no good; And all around the face of war Appear'd, just gathering, in the air. Now, shall we here describe a battle, And if they encounter him at all, Say, shall he wage an equal fight; And wound whole ranks, and kill outright; Like val'rous Hector, at the siege, Of Troy, compose a perfect bridge, Of bodies, upon which to tread, And swell the rivers with the dead; Or mow a whole battalion down, Like Ajax, son of Telamon; Construct a rampart of the slain; And strew with carcases the plain? Or shall I bid him jump among The individuals of the throng; Like Alexander, when half crazy, He leapt among the Oxydracæ? Or represent him as expert, The various wiles of war t' exert; Now giving way, and now advance, To spit a parcel on his lance? Shall I describe a various fray, And change the fortune of the day; Now on the verge of a defeat; And now, in turn, advantage get; One while broke down, like very stubble; Now rise, and give the foe more trouble? What wounds shall specify; what heart Oppress with javelin or dart? What names relate, and characters Of those who rag'd this day like bears? I wave the arduous task of this; Because narration would be lies; For, just the naked truth express'd, In history, is always best. Hence shall relate what came to pass; And how the issue really was; Videlicet—but here again, I feel the rushing epic vein, To bring Minerva, from the clouds, Down sliding through aerial shrouds; To make her vet'ran champion wise, And teach him that no honour lies In waging battle, where the chance, Of war, between the combatants, Is so unequal, as this was; For, had no head piece, made of brass, Or iron, adamant, or wood; And let him do the best he could; Yet still, the number, and the weight, Of blows, that must assail the pate, Would overpower his best defence, And wound him, or knock out his brains. 'Twas no Minerva, or a God From dome celestial, or abode, But, his own reason, play'd the part, And put discretion in his heart. For, seeing that the wild misrule, Of mob, as raging to the full, As pedlars at an Ulster fair, With their shilelahs, swung in air, Left him no hope of victory, He thought the best way was to fly; T 2 And without waiting for the blows, He turn'd the corner of a house; Escaping from the rioters: As when a morning shadow stirs, And hides itself behind a wood, Before the sun that would suck blood, Pursuing, with his rising heat, The thing that is not adequate, To give him battle, and withstand The numerons beams he has at hand: To overpower it on the plains, And maul it, and knock out its brains. Retir'd, and to a tavern got, Where disturbance there was not; Fatigu'd with what had sung and said; Now on a sofa laid his head; Because he did not wish to trudge. God Morpheus who does not begrudge A dream, sent one to keep him quiet. He saw a plain, and there espied, The champions of the former period, And airy coursers, on which they rode: The cavalcade of ancient knight-hood; A show would do the very sight good; Such, as the monsters, had knock'd down; And dwarfs, and giants, overthrown; And fiery dragons of the air; And pale fac'd virgins that were there; Whom they had rescued from the grasp, Of ravishers that did enclasp Their snowy bodies, in their arms; And drank the lustre of their charms; Or knights themselves, who had been freed, From oaken durance, where were treed; Or bound in rocks, where by a spell, They had remained invisible. The Cincinnat approach'd the throng, Who beckon'd him to come along; As recognizing his advance, To be that of no common man's; But one who came to join the squad, By that same baublet that he had; With ensign of the eagle's beak, And motto in th' original Greek Or Latin, knew not which it was: For things had come to such a pass, When these knights flourish'd, devil a one, Had such a thing as learning known; But all depended on their slashing, For fame, and for diurnal ration; And cut and carv'd their sustenance, By force of vig'rous arm and lance. The Cincinnat address'd as ought, With chosen words and select thought, Quoth he, my seniors, in the art, Of chivalry's great master part; You see me of a junior breed; A germ, sprung from the self same seed, Of predecessors in romance, And orders that did flourish once; Profession now degenerate, Reduc'd to the very lowest state; For even the Cincinnati club Which imitative is set up, Is much traduc'd, and badge they wear Is greatly undervalu'd here; For instance that same pedagogue, And clergyman that is in vogue, And other cavillers, just now I met with in a town came through; Do lead astray the populace, Who have no judgment in the case. A senior from the squad step'd forth, Of a superior mien, and worth: Quoth he, the more the degradation, Of chivalry, the more occasion, For an exertion of the brain, To kindle up the thing again; And doubtless this same club of yours, Has, as't were added boots and spurs, To bring it to a trot once more And restore the days of yore. And, if discouragements arise, In this the greater honour lies, To overcome and persevere. 'Tis true, no dragons of the air, Or fiery vultures do occur, T' encounter with, and make a stir; Or damsels ravish'd in a wood; Or giants to let out his blood: Or an enchanter with his spell; But yet there is the devil in hell To pay with other villainies, That in your modern days take rise, Such as false notions of the right, Which it behooves a valourous knight T' arraign with free born thought and speech And tell the people which is which; And no less courage is requir'd, To speak the truth with which are fir'd; Than to knock down a cow at grass, Or monster that did come to pass. Adventure, quoth the Cincinnat, Not much less perilous than that La Mancha's knight attempted when, Somewhat unstable in his brain, He took a wind-mill for a giant; For like catastrophe is nigh hand To him that combats with opinion That is once fixed and has dominion; Whether the monster of the hour, Be anarchy or other power In shape of mob, or demagogue Which is another name for rogue; As just now with a rabble rout I did experience in the crowd, In an adventure that was hot, And where no credit could be got; So that I deem it preferable To joust with you than with the rabble Of mankind in their prejudices, Which no man ever did who wise is; And so escaping I am here To enter lists and break a spear. Meantime a message had been sent By Charlemagne to call from tent, By trumpeter, the several orders, That lay upon th' enchanted borders. Our hero look'd to see where was, Old Cincinnatus in the case. In vain, for, in Elysium hous'd, His mettle had not yet been rous'd; But mixed, with the ignoble shades, Did wander, idly in the glades; And as in life, had been a ploughman, And wore no badge, or dress uncommon; So now he troubles not his head, With these; but walks among the dead, The Romans or obscurer Greeks; That wore no pendle at their necks. So much for vision of the dream, That came into the head of him. But now the Cincinnat below. Awaking as some one came through, Saw nothing but the standing chairs, And landlord coming down the stairs. The following comprises the scene in the 7th chapter of the 2d volume. THE MODERN CHEVALIER.* * This was written about the year 1788-9, and gave rise in the authors mind to this publication under the signature of Modern Chivalry. NOT far off hence there was a cabin Inhabited by a great Rabbin, A weaver who had serv'd the state, Which Chevalier did not know yet, And therefore having heard the loom, Just as he had that way come More out of humour than of ire Began to feel a great desire T' accost the manufacturer, And ask him what was doing there; A breed that earth themselves in cellars, Like conjurors or fortune tellers; Devoid of virtue and of mettle; A sort of subterranean cattle, Of no account in church or state, Or ever think of being great, As warriors or as politicians, But lurk in dungeons like magicians. Shall such an animal disturb Quoth he, the peace of our suburb? Or shall we drive him from his house, Give him two or three kicks or blows? Or is it best t' expostulate And reasonably the matter state, Why such inglorious life he leads; And on alternate traddle treads? Agreed; for what is moderate, In counsel has the greatest weight; And now advancing to the window Like lover to his Rosalinda, Address'd the manufacturer, Or as 't were whisper'd in his ear, With words mellifluous and speeches And parables, and far fair fetches, His censure of the occupation: But take it as it was; the oration. “Believe me not a Knight uncourt'ous, Devoid of manners and of virtues, Though thus abruptly I address you, But calmly wait and hear the issue. Are you enchanted by some gipsey, Who on your heart has cast a sheep's eye, And fain would hug you to her amours In low and subterranean chambers, That thus you linger in sick mansion, Where never hath the light of sun shone? Or worsted in some desperate wrangle, By Giant, is your foot and ancle Enthral'd in bondage past unloosing? Or are you here of your own chusing! And for your pastime tread on traddles, As men in water play with paddles, Or maidens on spinnets that warble; Or harpsichord with grating ter'ble? Is that a loom that stands before ye That keeps you from the walks of glory? It ill befits that men whom nature, Hath favour'd with such parts and feature, Should waste the taper of existence, In meaner arts, when their assistance Is wanted both in field and council, To help our politics at groundsell, And make some new and wholesome laws, Or is it reasonable those claws Should be employ'd in knotting threads; Or oratorial shoulder blades Should work, to drive the texture close, Which else might in the Senate house, With proper gesture give just force To your expressions and discourse? No doubt you have the eloquence, If we could but extract it thence, To bend the judgment and persuade And hit the right nail on the head; For half the force of nature lies In latent powers and qualities Which but the art of men alone Or the occasion can make known. What is there in the orifice Of oral organ or of eyes, That you should only gape and stare, Just fit to carry guts to a bear? Arise and shake your slumber off; You have capacity enough; Assume your place in state affairs, And get up to the top o' th' stairs.” The weaver sat and gap'd awhile, Astonish'd at unusual stile, And was preparing to reply With a new lustre in his eye, When on the outside came a blow From unknown but unnatural foe. It was the weaver's termagant Who overhearing the Knight's rant Did snatch a cudgel, and essay'd A blow upon his shoulder blade, Not to enable him with title, But to give vent t' her rage a little; But missing upper, did alight Upon the postern of the Knight, For head in window and hat slouching He saw not this grey mare approaching, The better horse at least o' th' weaver And kept him in subjection ever. Quoth she, what raggamuffin this That comes to broach absurdities, And turn again the crazy head Of Traddle from his daily bread; The business of his warp and woof, Who has already had enough Of politics and stuff, God knows, Since first the hurry scurry rose: The Devil burn them with hot pinchers, And scorch their knuckle joints and fingers, Who put it first in his conceiving To think of this, and quit his weaving, While customer is at the door And must have work done: what is more, In these affairs what does he know? About as much as my brown cow. No wonder that am out of humour With the discourse of every comer That puts such whimsies in his brain To turn him to his freaks again. With that she lays another thwack, Impetuously upon the back Of Knight who thought but of retiring T' avoid th' unexpected firing, 'Till reconnoitering the foe, He could distinguish who was who. No doubt he could have match'd the onset, For his long sword was not the bluntest; But seeing her unwarlike sex, With petticoat about her legs, He took again his hand from hilt; For no presumption of the guilt Could justify by laws of order The hurting her or going further, For such the deference due the weaker, That for a Knight to draw a trigger Or lift his hand against a woman, Is deem'd unfair and unbecoming, But rather gradually assuage With oil of courtesy her rage, And having dissipated clamour, Convert the contest to an amour. So having drop'd his ire and hanger, He thus address'd him to harnague her. Uncourteous Damsel or Enchantress, For you are not a common laundress, What œstrum or phrenetic fury, So underhandedly could spur ye, To bastinado me, and break My body from the rump to the neck, Because I would do him a service So long immur'd beneath the surface, Why then from you uncourteous usage Hard words, and cudgelling surplusage? For such my meaning and fond wishes, I had not thought of blows but kisses: At least from one so fair as you are, For as to charms of person few are, More fit to be a Del' Tobosa And in Romances make a huzza. Are you unwilling to take rise, Above your natural pedigrees, And get your family upstairs Securing honour to your heirs For be your wife or virgin daughter Draw but a ticket in state lotter' And have relation to the house, Especially if tis a spouse, He draws you up to the same place, Acquiring novel privileges. Quoth she, experience is best proof, And therefore I am wise enough To know the fulsomness of this And Traddl's popular services. Much better he would keep t' his loom, Nor listen to the roocks that come And talk of the affairs of state; Not much the better for them yet; A set of idle lounging louts That talk of interest and of votes And keep him from his work, discoursing, But never see them draw a purse string, To recompence the loss of labour: And after all what is't but jabber; For what can he or they discover, As I have told them over and over In government that can be worth The knowing or the calling forth? Vol. IV. U The saying hits th' nail on th' head; “Let every cobler stick t' his trade,” And therefore be what you will I take your interfering ill, To touch the fiddle-string again Of politicks that turns his brain. No wonder that I feel some passion, On this particular occasion, And meditate another stroke; Nor care I if your back is broke. Quoth Knight, not half so much the blows Of oaken stick hath wrought me woes, As the bright lustre of your eyes Which touches my propensities. With teeth as white as ebony— There's many a man would give a guinea, To taste the ruby of your lips. 'Tis said that when a knight equips Himself for deeds of chivalry, Behooves t' have some one in his eye Who fires his thoughts, and at whose feet Throws all the victories he can get. Now you are such a paragon Of beauty's diamond set in stone, That I am willing to enthral, My heart to you and give you all. Quoth she, my eyes are not so bright That I can see without some light, Nor have I any other teeth Than serve to eat provisions with. But were it so that I had beauty, I better know my sworn duty Than to in the world have it said That I put horns on Traddle's head. Quoth Knight, but is indissoluble The knot, or cannot carry double? Th' idea of antlers is a figure Which are put on by the intriguer, And do not in real'ty grow Upon the injur'd husband's brow, To make him Elk or Unicorn With single or with double horn, Or hinder him to enter door, Or move as easily as before. Think what an honour it will be To have a progeny by me, Some gallant chieftain or a worthy To turn the world topsy turvy; Unlike the offspring of one bred To a diminutive manual trade; Whose mind partakes of situation And the subordinate occupation. Quoth she have read some of your books Knight errant Quixots', and their jokes, Who fought with windmills, in a wood, And drew from one another blood. But was it not the rule with these First to perform the services Before did claim the ladies favour As the demerit of their labour, Now there is not far off a writer To whom I bear a little spite here, Because he laughs at Traddle's nonsense Which is not equal to his own sense, And says it is a vile state slur To chuse him for a senator; And though some truth may be in this Not always should the truth express, At least when it concerns him not; Now I would have you go red hot And cudgel him for his provoking, And his unseasonable joking; For though it is ridiculous That Traddle should go to the house, Or take a seat as he has done, Why should it be so harp'd upon, Or any but myself express A sense of the unworthiness, Though by the bye he is as fit, As others that have no more wit, And yet are pass'd by in the ballad Escaping names that he is called. Quoth Knight, you hit the very essence Of all my spirits' effervescence Which is to tread in magic steps Of chivalry, and hair breadth scapes, Redressing injury and wrong, Or matron grave or damsel young; For beauty is a brand that lights Warm passion in the breast of Knights, Down from the earliest days to this, Which is at bottom of the base. As to this writer in Gazette He is a rascally marmozette, As more that drew satiric quill Half starv'd in garret 'gainst their will, And worse than spiders which inhabit The same aerial dome and abode. Or wasps who with their nests incumber Aerial garrets amid lumber, And sting the very hand that presses, Or lodges with them, and caresses. No wonder that a mess-mate writer Should be a damnable back-biter, And if he has not kings t' engage Attacks a weaver with his rage; But shall repent it suddenly. The Lady blandish'd with her eye, And seem'd to thank him for his heat, Hence set out to enquire the seat, And chastise this Archilous With battery and actual blows, For words no more affect such vermin Than does a hypocrite, a sermon, Who turns deaf ear to your inveigh'ng And goes on with his work again; Though first it might be well t' upbraid Before should come to break his head; Preserve the usual character Of good men when they go to war, That of humanity and pains To save the loss of blood and brains, Until necessity aloud Doth say that such way does no good; Then it behooves t' impress the force Of arm and cudgel on the curs. It was a garret high in th' air With small incumbrance round it where The Rhymster had his residence And issued all his lampoons thence, The Knight perceiv'd him as he enter'd With scratch and scrawl of verse encenter'd, And though lip quivered and his rage Bespoke the war he meant to wage, Yet did compose his brow to rest And thus the adversar' address'd. Quoth he, though not devoid of manners To the more honourable retainers Of muse, and melody, and wit, Who labour daily to excite, The pleasing images of fancy, In ode or madrigal or stanza; Yet scarce have common courtesy, To dogrel versifiers that lie In obscure garrets, and from thence Send forth th' expenditure of brains: As't were the inmates of the rafter, The fabricators of low laughter; Who spare not neighbouring characters Of any animal that stirs, Up from the beggar to the prince; And uselessly must break their shins, Just merely to express the jest That comes into their heads in haste: The ebullition of their fun; And you are such a son of a gun; For is there not one Traddle, whom You have depicted as the scum Of Politicians of the age, Which puts his Lady in a rage; A weaver made a senator; Object it to him as a slur; And undervalue manual trade, And calling of inferior grade; Whereas in such consists our riches, Without them where were coat or breeches Or other vestment that we wear But for the manufacturer? But whence particular hate to this, The sphere of your antipodes; The cellar weaving Knight that lurks While you swim to the top like corks, And take your station in mid air, And weave your compositions there, And ought to have a fellow feeling For those in nadir of your dwelling: U 2 For both are of the mystery Though one is low the other high, But being a lady in the case Behooves to interpose; suppress Your obloquy in verse or prose, Kick breech or corrugate the nose, For such the dernier resort, Reciprocation of the sport; That, diction when it meets repulse Should vibrate to its native sculls, And reach the head that fram'd the verse And did maliciously asperse. Quoth writer, though a man o' th' sword, Yet by the grammar of your word You seem of literary talent, With noble air and manner gallant, And hurts me that you have t' express The language of such prejudice Against a loitering garretteer, Eespecially myself, who here Have honour to receive address, From one of so much worthiness. But though we have our residence More elevate than other men's; Like mad-cap wasps, sting travellers, By flying at all characters; Yet not without a proper use In system to correct abuse, When what is fungous, or absurd In common matters has occur'd; For instance when the foot puts head Beneath upon the soil to tread, And takes itself the upper place, There is a monster in the case; And we designate it, and note Conversion of the head and foot, And cast a ridicule on swain, Who has ambition in his brain To be a statesman, and make laws, Instead of working with his claws: Because his nature had not made His mind for legislative trade; At least the want of literature T' appear with dignity in sphere, Is an obstruction to the rise: And hence more rational and wise To occupy the quondam place Than struggle for such loftiness, And hence it is I have inveigh'd 'Gainst Traddle, not because his trade Is underserving, but because Would quit it to enact our laws; For sir, would be as far as you From bringing matters into view, That may relate to means of living As that of boot-making or weaving. I hold all arts in estimation Nor undervalue occupation; And think a ditcher a good fellow, Provided he his business follow, It is unnatural change of places, And the conversion that disgraces, An able ditcher making laws A senator in the morass. In their own element all natures Appear with justifiable features: Why call a surgeon to set bone If judgment is not look'd upon? Is government an easy art, Just like the driving of a cart Which ever doth some skill require To keep the wheel out of the mire? 'Tis thought the highest art of man With comprehensive view to scan The various interests of a state And means of its becoming great. I question not the good intent Of Traddle for the government, But the ability and skill, On fact and similar principle. As if a customer mounts loom, Who accidentally might come; And though his will is just as good He cannot weave the web for's blood But breaks the thread and works much evil, Not instigated by the devil, And so not object of our hate Yet impropriety is great And in the nature of things absurd. The Knight had drank in every word And thought the principle of's speech, Some shew of reason seem'd to reach. Quoth Writer, it was first my view In what with Traddle had to do, To open eyes and men convince, At least the people of good sense, How injudicious they were Of sending untaught character To pourtray in the senate house As if he were the type of us; But now with the description wearied, Have brought my lampoons to a period, And will no farther speak or write, Especially since a worthy Knight As you appear to be, advise it, In this polite and friendly visit. Quoth Knight, th' opportune courtesy, Allays the passion that was high, And now t' apologise for question And my intruding on th' occasion, Am of the order, and a Knight Whose object is to set things right; Depress th' unworthy and raise up The preferable to the top, And injury and force restrain Of warriors sword, or writers pen, Distributing best services And keep commonwealth in peace, And hence was led to interfere In aid of Traddle's character, Whose Lady is an Amazon, And beauty's perfect paragon, And laid it on me as a task My sword and battery to unmask, Against your irony and wit By which her conjugal is hit, And bid your pipe and verse repose, Or take th' incendiar' by the nose, Which from apology so courteous, Expressive of your sense and virtues, I wave, as being satisfied That you have reason on your side: But for the sake of this said matron For am no rigid son of saturn, Would wish you to be smooth and moderate Until your differences are solder'd, Nor carry to extremes the war, But learn to conquer and to spare. Enough is said to give you sense Without your taking farther pains, So drop your currency of quill And volubility be still, And turn to other quarters for The instances that may occur T' elucidate your argument, And give your oratory vent: For though so rough my late address, Do not consider you the less, But rank you as of class with us, A writer at th' top of house; A kind of literary knight, Dispos'd to keep the world quiet By aid of your satiric verse, Th' insignificant t' amerce, Or put down villainy and pride That has opinion on its side, For ridicule's a test of truth, No less than reason; for it sheweth, The weak and vulnerable part, And probes distemper to the heart. Hence kings have dreaded it and beggars, More than artill'ry that beleaguers Of rational and sober sense; For when men laugh the farce begins, And thing becomes aharlequin: Whom you contemple with a grin Leads men to hate it: as you please Can turn the adversar' to geese, To rat or monkey, and give tails Just as the ide' you have prevails; Effectual as magicians spell, Or conjuror come out of hell, For on retina of the eye, Doth spread the worst absurdity, So that no power of champion's sword Doth surer victory afford, Or throws a more oppressive weight Into the scale of church or state. Quoth writer, what you represent, Is doubtless a great compliment T' assimilate a knight and writer, And of an equal worth consider; But waving compliment, and reason You have set forth with good expression; I deem it greatly fortunate That in this boist'rous time though late, One has arisen with such skill To subjugate all shape of ill. It seem'd to me not long ago As I did read a page or so, The spirit of Chivalry was gone Which has in other ages shone, And left the world to common means; Where what is gradual intervenes, Without the aid of knight or waiter To interfere and make it better. But since excluding this conclusion, You as it were have made intrusion, And shewn by an example splendid, That such exertion is not ended, Go on like other combatants Not just like them in killing g'ants; But in performing modern good, For ages are not now so rude As to produce the like disorders Which were remov'd by ancient orders; And more by chivalry of tongue Remains it now to redress wrong, Than by an actual violence; No doubt we had good share of sense, Among the people of these states; But yet have taken 't in their pates, Because have privilege of office They have the qualities that suffice, And as republics have laid open Advance to all men, there's no stopping, And not a thing that wears a head By an immediate impulse led But sets up for a senator. And though we do not hear the stir, Of giants, monsters now adays, Yet there is trouble other ways, In keeping down licentiousness Of what we call our privileges, And just as much ado to quash Election that is rather rash, As was of old to knock down champ'ons; And tho' harangu'd them in my lampoons, Yet still the populace do err Not chusing qualified that are; But giving to such men their votes That have as little sense as goats; And thus it was that though did wage A war with Traddle, had no rage, Against the manufacturer; But meant it as a kind of slur Or fable designating hate Against this evil in the state, Men running up to services Who are not fitted for the place, Not having just capacity, Because another way doth lie The effort of the untaught brain; Not that they are inferior men, But of themselves are very good Provided would not thus intrude, And make equality a curse By not distinguishing the force And aptitude of natural powers For their own offices or ours. And now this day there is a rout Scarce on your way a mile about, Of people met to form a ticket Of those who chuse to politic it, And be our representatives According as their interest thrives For the respective candidate; It would do service to the state, If such a noble Knight as you Would teach them what they ought to do, And give them seasonable lessons Respecting such their crude creations, That on the one hand while they pass The ignorant though monied ass, So on the other should avoid The chusing such amongst the crowd As are unqualified though less, They may in property possess The Knight set out, and not far off Fell in with people busy enough About the matter of a choice, And soon distinguish'd some one's voice, As one who was a candidate. The Knight address'd the people met With usual stile of eloquence, Quoth he, my fellow citizens, No doubt you are all men of skill In state affairs, and have good will In serving this our government Republican from Heaven sent, Where all may climb to offices Like animals that clamber trees; But yet this liberty should use As Saint Paul says, so not t' abuse; And while each one retains the right To bring his talents to the light, Yet let the public mind prefer I do not say the worthier But him most for the office fit, By his peculiar cast of wit, And talent for particular case And senatorial services, As nature fits one horse to run Another draws artillery gun; For surely in the framing laws There's need of something more than claws, Or horn or hoof, or nails to scratch At least to frame them with dispatch; For judgment must be something worth And speech to make a man hold forth, And justify the step he takes; Else twisted like a nose of wax He bends just to the fugal man With whom the yea or nay began; Doth loose the natural dignity Which all men have in reason's eye While unaffectedly they move And keep the corresponding groove, For when th' unqualified are up, And take their station at the top, The commonwealth may be express'd In the similitude of beast That runs with tail upon its back In its excursion through the brake; Racoon, opossum or a bear, Devoid of intellect that are. These words encourag'd one hard by Who had advancement in his eye, From the pretension of some sense, To hazard his own eloquence. Quoth he, have had the inclination To take a turn in public station, Not that I have the greatest skill, But that I have the best good will To be a representative, And make the public interest thrive; T' assist your trade, and make you rich, And give you liberty, for which You have sustain'd so long a war And now at length victorious are. What profits it to have knock'd down The great Cornwallis and Burgoyne If in the meantime money-less Your agriculture languishes? It is the fault of those at helm That these distresses overwhelm, For if just measures were pursued Our government would do us good: And mischiefs that are come to pass Be remedied by proper laws. But those you send are loggerheads And might as well be in their beds; Or if they have a little share Of sense and industry to spare, They lay it out for their own use And personal interest introduce. As for this man that is set up, What is foundation of his hope? Has he more knowledge than a goose? By what criterion do you chuse? Is it his speech or dialect, That has so rapidly you prick'd Vol. IV. X To elevate him to a sphere Where greatest orators appear? Or are you credulous there is In him some occult faculties Which when the time may come about You may be able to find out? Or is it out of mere caprice Would give him such unnatural rise To shew the people can supply A sudden respectability; A man to power and greatest weight From nothing as it were create? To him the man not erudite,— For he could neither read or write But by a necromantic skill Could lead the people at his will, By means of some infernal dews By which he sprinkled them profuse: Not dews of Acheron or Styx, By which he play'd these magic tricks, But dews which he himself distill'd From what he gather'd in his field: Men call it whiskey, but the Gods Call't what they please above the clouds Who tasted it was straightway drawn Insensibly to taste again, And such the virtue of the fluid, But say not whether bad or good, Whoever put his nose to th' steam Conceiv'd the delusory dream Of being more than what he was; And hence it easily came to pass H' attributed the fume o' his brain To a celestial origin; And thought the giver of the fluid With more than mortal pow'rs indu'd And worshipp'd him: you might have seen Idolators before the shrine At morn and midday prostrate there Or offering up an evening prayer. No wonder that they thought him fit With every talent requisite, To occupy a place of trust, Where weightiest matters are discuss'd, And gave up sense and power of vote For the ambrosia they had got; And hence he had been Constable, And acted as he was well able; And next a Justice of the peace, And bound o'er people at his ease, And now became a candidate For the assembly of the state, He made no speech, but pointed out, A keg of whiskey to the croud, As much as if to say there is, The test of my best services. Why need I say the man was chosen, By people waving like the ocean; The wonder would be if left out. The fact was he got every vote, And would have got had there been more, Or of competitors a score. The Knight broke silence, and gave scope To words as fast as he could ope, Regretting this such strange perversion, Of the political exertion. Quoth he, am no aristocrat To blame what people would be at, In chusing from the multitude Him destitute of noble blood, Nor fenc'd with family connections, To gain the popular affections. Nor do I much regard estate In chusing men to legislate, As if alone your purse-proud fellows Were capable to blow the bellows. For poor in purse as well as spirit, Have oftentimes the greatest merit, And those in lowest life have wit, And may be for an office fit, With education for the place And the connatural services, More than the rich and glorious, Who have a castle for a house And ask an hundred men to dine, Where all varieties combine, As if the eating much or drinking, Could help the faculty of thinking Or looking at the bulk of stones, Or brick they have about their bones, In shape of building, could advance Their parts above a common man's. Have known as many perfect beasts In ignorance at rich men's feasts, As ever in inferior station Where natural sense gets little lesson; Have no ide' that equipages, Can give unusual privileges, Of sense and reason in the brain, But often plain and labouring men May have more sense than those whom riches, Have dignified; the sons of bitches, That set a value on estates, As being a substitute for pates; Whereas the talent nature gives Original in the spirit lives, And independent of the sod Which else inglorious might be trod; And hence the men that have been sages, And greatest warriors of all ages, Have had their birth in poverty, And through distress have risen high: For exercise of wit gives wit, And renders the possessor fit, For station that he occupies, Or prompts him to superior rise, Whereas the weight of wealth keeps down, With an incumbrance of its own, The fool imagining his gold, Outweighs his folly when 'tis told And turns to wisdom what he says, Though ingorant as cow at grass. Have seen enough to make me sick Of purse proud men who very weak, Have arrogated sense though were As senseless as a sucking bear, Which I despise and reprobate, And would exclude them from the state, Educing better progeny Which fortune seems to have past by. So that no aristocracy But nature that I have in eye. Nor is it literature alone, That I would take my stand upon. There are as many natural fools, That have the literature of schools, As have it not; and mother wit, Is better than the whole of it: The common people have a right To throw into the state their mite, Though not born all philosophers, To gaze at planets and read stars, And not in the academies Are always found the very wise, And science is but little help To one by nature a dull whelp; But what is nature without art, To qualify for any part? Whether it be the making shoes, Or rectifying state abuse; For not, as in the scripture phrase Comes inspiration now adays To make a statesman prophecy And see with an intuitive eye, But men just as they were remain, Before were taken up. Again, The making laws is not of grace, And inspiration has no place, And so that whether poor or rich, And by the bye it makes not which; Or whether learned in school or not, Or education may have got, I want the man of sense, of brain, To put into the statesman's train; Which not in this case is the case, If one may from appearance guess. Is it necessity or use You have to plead in your excuse? Or do you wish to burlesque us By sending such a thing to th' house? It is ungen'rous and unfair, For you to be the merrier At our disgrace and ignominy, Being all as't were indigeni! Of this same soil and residence. Some thought the man had spoken sense, X 2 But others willing to dissent Not understanding what he meant Or caring much about the matter; (Just Lillibolera at Boyne water, Would have suited them as well, Or Gibberland or Granuel) Shewed symptoms of dissatisfaction, Opinion having a re-action; And urging an appeal to force, From the descision of discourse. So that it seem'd the wiser way To drop the occasion of affray, Retiring from the multitude And let him talk and fight who would. It struck into the head of knight, And glad he was he had come by't To go t' a conjurer and enquire, Into the case a little higher Of what had puzzled him of late These strange vagaries of the state; And humour of the multitude; Could do no harm, if not much good. Approach'd the cell, and this his speech, Quoth he I come not to beseech Your conjuror-ship to explicate How I a thing that's lost may get, A cow, a stray horse, or a sheep, But mystery that is more deep, Videlicet; (and here he stated The difficulty we have narrated.) Quoth conjurer could better tell What hurry scurry is in hell, Or going on above the sun Or will in future day be done; Can question nature in her course, And read the stars when mankind snores, Or cast nativities and teach A man's whole fortune at a stretch; Go under ground and dig up spades, Or dive in ocean to fish-beds, And rifle trunks of men of war That at the very bottom are Or run through dens beneath the earth And drag out thiefsters for our mirth, For this is given to conjurors skill But not a single syllable Above the common race of men To sphynx it and the cause explain Of natural phenomenon Such as you have just touch'd upon. Prevaricative, quoth Knight and false. Can you that trip it through stone walls Not enter into human breast, And read the passion there express'd, And tell the origin of it, In mode and manner explicit? If maid wants husband, you can shew The physiognomy of the beau, And yet not tell why men run mad Upon this legislative trade. Is't easier or of better use To find a stray horse, or stolen goose, Than satisfy one at a loss On what strange gudgeons this thing goes That populace who have some sense Should chuse a clod-pole without brains To be themselves as't were i' th' house And bear the politics th' espouse, Well knowing that the image must Bespeak th' original of bust, And that they suffer in the shape Which they send forward there to gape. Now tell me what the cause of this Absurdity of suffrages? Not able, quoth the conjuror, But there's a great philosopher Not far off who has studied books, And is a wise man by his looks, Considered human nature so That he can look it through and through, And knows the inside of the scull And breast of man, as well to th' full As I can by an astrolabe Take in the Heavens at a grab And tell the future destiny Of things that are in fortunes' eye: For this my skill, and my profession. Quoth Knight, no need of a disgression, Or further homily to explain Particular defect of brain. The moral causes are best known To him who keeps his noddle down, Upon affairs of state; whereas, In other studies for a cause, Behooves t' apply to them that know From the particular bent of brow. The mathematician can demonstrate What line is crooked or goes on strait; The chemist analyse a vapour And make the hydrogen appear Or oxygen if such there be Pent up in the concavity; So that apology you make Accounts in some sort for renege And reference to another office, For why or wherefore that may suffice; And hence I take me to my scrapers And farther investigating labours— Elsewhere t' examine, and discuss, This state arcanum &amp; non plus. So having spoke concluded diction, Lest he should make the conj'ror sick soon, And turn'd short off his perg'rination, With more of thought and less oration, Towards the sage's residence, And having entered thus begins. Quoth he, have been with a strange wight, Who proves a mere blatherskite, A conjuror but cannot tell, Tho' has much magic in his cell; How is it?—(here he stated knot, The difficulty he came about And pray'd the sage philosopher To give the reason of th' affair:) Was it enchantment of the brain, That hurts the intellects of men, And charms, that unawares invade With error, popular cavalcade, And mists and necromantic spells; Made out of pots and crucibles, To cloud the fancy and obscure, The honest vision of the viewer Who is deceiv'd and gives his vote, As blindly as if drawn by lot, Without distinction of the good, Or bad among the multitude. Quoth sage, it may be the gallanter, To say 'tis done by an enchanter, But so it is that simple nature, Without a cause occult or greater, Than men's own ordinary passions, Or accident of the occasions, Produces this phenomenon, You seem so much to harp upon. Sometimes it happens that caresses, And courtesy attains the graces, And bends the populace to him, Who falls in with the popular whim; For not th' inducement of best sense, But in our liking choice begins; For public interest gains no vote, It is an object so remote— Moreover envy of the good, Will put the people in a mood, To chuse the worst, out of mere spite, To shew you that they have a right, To take him up you call a fool Out of the election water pool: And of't without a thought they chuse, As't were by accident, a goose; Not knowing what they are about, Until the tickets are drawn out. Or if they would select the wise, Stupidity has his disguise Of sapience from his graver air, Whereas sound reason speaks out clear, And there is nothing magical, Where you can comprehend it all; But the obscure is the sublime, And hence the people value him, That has no speech at all, as gods, Were rais'd to the supreme abodes, In Egypt out of cats and rats, And leeks and onions and all that's Contemptible of beast or stock, Because these us'd no words to shock The adverse sentiments of men: Or what may farther serve t' explain; No one is jealous of the dunce, Nor journal thinks worth while to pounce Upon the ignoble candidate, While the artillery of gazette Plays on the obvious character Which can afford some wear and tear, And the excited prejudice To a new progeny gives rise Of falsehood and malevolence, Perversions that the bad dispense Against the endeavours of the good, And wise not rightly understood, So that, though medium of their hate, Refracted, there is nothing great, But like a wand in wave immers'd, Seems crooked from the being aspers'd, For as a fly is seen to poke His nose where'er the skin is broke, So calumny discovers faults, And from defects to crimes exalts; While such as have but little force Of nature like a cow or horse, Are safe, because what can be said But that they have been stolen or stray'd. Hence paragraphists have no woof, Or warp to make invective of And while no one exclaims, the wight, Is deem'd for the advancement fit, Or suffered to retain his place Not on the score of works but grace; Sufficient if he can say nay Or ope his mouth to get out yea, Just as the fugal man o' th' party, Gives motion to the Neil M`Carty: For being an automaton, The movement need not be his own And is more reg'lar the less sense, Of independence he retains, And less effects self-love of such, As actuate the scaramouche; And hence no word of him but good, At home amongst the multitude, So that he goes and goes again, While the republic lasts—Amen. The problem seemed to have solution, And merited a contribution. So asking what was to be paid, The able casuist shook his head, Declining to make charge—The Knight, Was glad to have so cheap come by't, And taking leave he wish'd him well, Which is the ending of the tale.</field>
