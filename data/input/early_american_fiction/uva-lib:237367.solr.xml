      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER I. The Moro Castle and Sloop-of-War. The loftier turrets of the Moro Castle were still sheathed with gold, from the reflection of the setting sun, while its embrasures and bastions lower down — its walls, still lower — and the harbor and town, far beneath, lay in the soft shadows of the first tremulous twilight. A moment more, and the last sunbeam disappeared, like a blaze suddenly extinguished, from the topmost pinnacle of the cloud-capped fortress; and the simultaneous roar of a heavy piece of ordnance, from the platform of the Castle, told the world of Havana that the sun had set. At the signal, there was a general descent of gay flags, from mast-head and peak, on board full three hundred vessels, of all nations, that lay at anchor within sound of the evening gun of the Moro. It was a brave sight, to behold so many gorgeous ensigns flying and fluttering in the air; and, seen from the battlements of the lofty Moro, they appeared like a flock of flamingoes, or birds of paradise, descending and alighting upon their decks. The smoke from the discharged gun floated away horizontally in the air, like a scarf unrolling itself from its folds, and, reposing at length upon the still air of evening, cast its blue reflection upon the dark surface of the harbor; and though it rested level with the ports of the Castle, to those below, on the vessels' decks it seemed a cloud in the sky, so elevated was this Gibraltar of the west above the surrounding scene. A young man, in the undress of an officer of the American Navy, stood listlessly watching this light cloud, in the gangway of a beautiful sloop-of-war that lay at anchor within pistol-shot of the Moro, — so near, indeed, that, to range her lowest battlement with his eye, he had to elevate his line of vision above the fore top-gallant yard-arm, the sloop being anchored with her head towards the rock. Near the sloop, between her and the rock, and perpendicularly under the Castle, was moored a small, old-fashioned Spanish or St. Domingo lugger, of about forty tons, and rigged with two polacca masts, for carrying foresail and mainsail, and a dwarf mast, stepped in the taffrail, on which to rig `a driver,' in running before the wind. The craft had nothing about her to attract the particular notice either of seamen or landsman, save her extremely antiquated and unseaworthy appearance. No one was visible upon her shallow deck but a negro, with a gray head and a gray mustache; and silent and motionless she lay, in the dark 1* shadow of the Castle, reflecting from the black, waveless flood, her uncouth proportions in singular and forcible contrast to the elegant and airy figure of a small clipper-schooner, that rode at her buoy about a hundred fathoms farther in the harbor, and nearly in a line with the American sloop-of-war. The young officer was idly watching the smoke of the cannon unroll itself along the air, like a piece of delicate tinted azure silk thrown out upon a carpet, and when it reposed above his mast-head, like a canopy, he let his eye fall upon the lugger, which had only come to anchor there a few moments before the day had closed. A smile passed across his handsome sea-browned face, as he surveyed her motley appearance. He then cast his eye beyond the craft, upon the clipper, and his features lighted up with a more animated and pleased expression, as he admired her beautiful proportions, and the seaman-like set of her yards, and the nautical precision which marked every thing about her. `There is as much difference, Mr. Forrestal,' said a reefer, who was following the direction of his officer's eye, and seemed to understand the nature of his thoughts, `there is as much difference between those two craft as between a venerable barn-yard pullet and a lady's hunting falcon!' `You have expressed the difference very clearly, Harry,' responded the officer, turning upon him with a smile of personal kindness. `Were you on deck, Mr. Forrestal, when the lugger — I mean the old pullet — set herself down there to roost, almost on the end of our flying-jib boom?' `No. Who worked her? I see only a negro on board.' `There are three or four others, Spaniards, below, at their supper of garlic and dried fish! Pah! don't you smell the air that is infected with their messes? Give me two marines and the gunner's monkey-boy, Ben, and I'll cut her out and send her about her business!' Forrestal laughed, and, tapping the youth, who was a lad of almost girlish beauty, scarce sixteen, — `I fear it would bring on a war between us and Spain, Harry, if there should be blood shed,' he answered, in the same vein in which his young friend had spoken. `What think you of your lady's falcon? Would you like to cut her out?' `I would like —,' and the youth stopped full and colored. `Well, what would you like, Harry?' `I would like to have you in command of that clipper-schooner, I your “first,” a picked crew, and sail away to rescue from her prison that lovely Spanish princess they say is held in bondage, by the king, her uncle, in a castle on the Mediterranean!' `That would be romantic, to say the least. I fear we should be more likely to share her fate, than do her a service. When you are ten years older, Harry, you will express some other wish, in reference to the schooner, than rescuing a Spanish princess. You will leave such matters to Don Quixote! Nay, — don't look hurt, my brave boy, — I appreciate your chivalric feelings, and know they spring from a generous and noble nature.' `I am not hurt, Mr. Forrestal. It was not so much romance as a deeper feeling that prompted me to utter this wish, — a feeling that is based on an event which, perhaps, you do not know of; but which exerts an influence over my thoughts, my dreams, and, oftentimes, my words and actions!' `What is this circumstance to which you allude, my dear Henry?' asked the officer, kindly. `I have heard from the commander that there is an interesting feature in your history. It is this, doubtless, to which you allude. The captain once was about to make it known to me, as I was dining in the cabin with him, but something interrupted the narrative at its commencement.' `For the three months that I have been sailing in this ship, you have, sir, shown me very great kindness.' `You have won it out of me, rather, Harry, by your cheerfulness and good humor.' `Yet I have received it from you,' answered the youth, grateful emotion causing a tremor in his tones. `I will tell you all I know of myself, and why I had uppermost in my thoughts a wish seemingly so fanciful. I was born in England, and of a family of wealth, whatever was its rank; for I have distinct recollection of being surrounded with all the appurtenances of opulence in my childhood. I had a sister nearly three years older than I. Her I remember as if I saw her face reflected in the deep blue water into which I gaze, instead of my own. Her soft hazel eyes, her flowing brown hair, her rosy cheeks, and ripe-red lips and joyful laugh, and her sweet tones when she called me “brother, brother!”—all these, Mr. Forrestal, are present to my mind. I can never forget them. I dream of them all, almost nightly, and the presence of my sister's voice is ever with me, waking, echoing in the ear of my heart!' The officer silently pressed the hand of his young friend, and as Harry returned the warm and sympathizing pressure, Mr. Forrestal felt tears trickle warm upon his fingers. Both continued for a moment silent. The distant cry of the Spanish sentry upon the battlements above their heads, rung clearly out upon the air; the rippling sound and measured dip of the oars of a boat rowed by at a distance; the deep, mellow tolling of the Cathedral clock in the city; the far-off shout of one calling to his fellow; the musical song of the seamen in a neighboring ship getting their anchor, all came distinct, yet melodiously mingled to their ears. They listened to the soothing sounds for a few moments, and the young midshipman, aided by these in subduing his emotion, thus resumed his narration: `The abode of my childhood was upon the banks of a river—a pleasant river, on which small vessels sailed by; but whither bound, I know not. One day I was in pursuit of a tame doe, which playfully eluded my efforts to take it, and drew me along the banks of the river till I was out of sight of the house. The house I remember with distinctness, and should recognize it at once, should I ever behold it again. Alarmed, I was turning to run back, when a man, who was standing by a boat near the shore opposite a vessel called to me, exhibiting at the same time some large oranges. As he called me by name, and with a smile offered me the fruit, fearless of danger and unsuspicious, I went to him. He gave me one of the oranges, and said to me, ` “These two are for your sister. Go home and tell her there is a person waiting here to give them to her; and be sure you inform no one but her.” ' `I hastened, and found her on the lawn, coming to seek me. I told her what the strange man had said, and showed her the orange I had received. With a laugh and a bound, she started off, and we soon reached the boat. The man was standing in it; but on seeing us he got out, and I saw two men rise up in the boat, and take the oars. As soon as my sister came near, he advanced towards her, presenting the orange, and as she timidly extended her hand to take it, he caught her by the arm, and raising her in his arms leaped into the boat with her. Isidore shrieked aloud, when he rudely pressed his hand upon her mouth. Although I could have been scarcely six years old at the time, alarmed for my sister's safety, and indignant at seeing her thus treated, I sprang forward, and clinging to the man, struck him with what strength I could wield, and demanded my sister. Not heeding me, the men, on his getting in, pushed off into the stream, while I still clung weeping and threatening to him, and endeavoring to take her from him. In vain he tried to force me to release my hold. I clung to him with the strength of despair and determination. In the mean while, the men had been pulling swiftly towards their vessel, and I found, from what words passed, that I was by no means a welcome passenger. My sister was the only one they sought, and doubtless had been laying in wait for.' `To what conceivable purpose?' asked Forrestal, manifesting the deepest surprise and interest. `I am ignorant to this moment. Finding they could not get rid of me without throwing me overboard, which was proposed by one of the men, but resisted by him who held Isidore, they let me remain; and on reaching the side of the vessel, the two oarsmen tore me from my affrighted sister, whom I was now clinging to, and cast me rudely upon the deck. It was now twilight, and without delay they got the vessel under weigh, first locking my sister and myself in the cabin. Alone together, we cast ourselves in one another's arms, and wept bitterly, our young hearts filled with a thousand fears.' `This is certainly a most extraordinary relation!' said Forrestal, with emotion, and looks of astonishment. `But do not let me interrupt you. Proceed, for I am deeply interested.' `We remained, it seemed to me, a long, long time, together in the cabin; but it may not have been half an hour. At length, the man came down, and unlocking the door, entered, and frowning fiercely upon me, he said: ` “You deserve to be thrown overboard! You are one more than I bargained for!” ' `But I will hasten with my story. We sailed out to sea, and day after day we kept on with no land in sight. I and my sister were at length permitted to stay on deck, and go about the vessel as we chose; and the captain (as the man was, who took us forcibly away from our home,) seemed to take a pleasure in our society, and gradually my sister conquered her repugnance and fears; but my hostility was not to be overcome by any of his efforts to win my confidence.' `What class of vessel was the one you were in?' `A brig.' `Do you remember her name?' `No, I do not.' `Nor the captain's?' `No, sir.' `Would you recognize him, if you should meet him again?' `Yes, as quickly as I would you, sir, were I to leave you now and meet you to-morrow again.' `Go on, Harry. I would hear the end of this strange affair.' `At length we reached a port—a large city. I know now that it was Boston, but I was not then told its name. We came near the wharves, and anchored. It was just at dark. The captain then took me by the hand, and said; ` “Now, boy, bid good-by to your sister, for you will never see her again!” ' and he led me towards her. `On hearing these words, I was frantic with grief and indignation; and instead of embracing her, I turned to vent my emotions of anger upon the monster who had thus torn us from our parents, and was now to rend us from each other. Finding I would not take leave of her, he took me forcibly from the vessel, and placed me in a boat alongside. My cries were suppressed by his hand pressed against my face, and in this manner I was held by him until the men pulled ashore. He then got out with me, and threatened me, if I opened my lips to make any further outcry, he would kill me on the spot; at the same time exhibiting a knife before my eyes. I suffered him to lead me up into the city, and, carrying me to the steps of a large house, he told me to sit there until he returned. How long I remained there I am not able to say. I must have very soon fallen asleep. It was very late, when I was awaked by a hand upon my shoulder, and a kind voice addressing me, and asking me why I was sleeping there upon the cold steps, with my head resting against the marble column. Instead of replying, I recollect that I burst into tears. He took me by the hand, and led me into the mansion. From that moment, Mr. Forrestal, I had a friend and benefactor. I told him all my story, and he became to me in place of my father, and I know used every effort to ascertain who my parents were. He educated me, and treated me as a son; and two years ago, when he died, left me the half of his large fortune. Moreover, he obtained for me the berth I now hold in the navy, this profession being my choice, and chosen, perhaps, with some vague idea that I might one day visit England, and yet behold again the home, from which I and my sister were so singularly and mysteriously taken. `And you have heard nothing of that home, nor your parents, since?' `Nothing, sir!' 2 `And your sister?' inquired Forrestal, with slight hesitation, as if not wishing to move his feelings by the reminiscence of her. `From the hour I was taken on shore off India Wharf, in the small-boat, and left to perish in the streets of Boston, I have neither seen nor heard from Isidore!' `This is very strange!' `It is probable that she has perished, sir,' said Harry, sadly. `I trust not,' answered the officer with emphasis. `I trust you will yet behold her again.' `It is a faint hope that she lives that both makes me cheerful and sad; cheerful, at the idea that we may meet again,—sad, at the reflection that if she is living it may be in great misery and degradation. I have often imagined her imprisoned in some place by the seaside, and when I heard of the imprisonment of this Spanish princess I thought of my poor sister, and that possibly she may be lingering in some desolate spot, the prisoner of this monster. It was this feeling which prompted me to give you the reply I did.' `And I am very glad you gave it, my dear boy. It has been the means of opening to me the knowledge of your strange history, and enlisting my strongest sympathies and friendship in your behalf.' `You are very kind, Mr. Forrestal,' answered the youth, pressing his hand; `you are very kind, sir; but I fear I shall never behold either my sister or my mother and my father's home again. I sometimes think I ought never to smile or be gay; but then the natural cheerfulness of my spirit will break forth; though few know, sir, how heavy the heart is beneath.' `This should not, and I am glad it does not, altogether make you depressed. The world is fair still, and has many sunny scenes; and perhaps yet all this mystery that hangs around you will be cleared away, and you will find the remainder of your years happy and unshadowed by a sorrow.' `I have little hope, sir. If I knew that Isidore was dead, Mr. Forrestal, I should be less unhappy; but the consciousness that she may be living, and living in the power of that dark and evil man, at times almost makes me frantic.' `Was this man a foreigner? Yet, as you were so young you could not tell.' `Though I was young, and at the time could not form a correct judgment upon what occurred and was visible around me, yet so vividly are those things and events impressed upon my memory, that I can look back upon them and judge of them with my present experience. In this way I am able to say that the vessel was a brig, for now I know that the form of the vessel that was engraven upon my mind then, belongs to a vessel of this class. In this way I can speak with accuracy of what otherwise I might be incapable of describing.' `Your history is a very singular one, my dear Harry. Do you recollect your family name?' he asked, quickly. `No; I only remember that my name was Henry. Such my parents, such my sister, called me.' `And her name was Isidore? By this time, if she be alive, she must be in her nineteenth year.' `Yes, Mr. Forrestal. But I shall never see her alive again; or I would rather know her to be dead, than find her in a condition of degradation; for this man would be guilty of any wickedness.' `What was his appearance?' `Large of stature, with light long hair, blue eyes, and heavy brows. His voice was harsh and his bearing stern. Yet I think he had the air of a gentleman; certainly he was not a low ruffian.' `It is more extraordinary still! But why do you start? what ails thee, boy?' `That voice—that man!' `Who?—what man?' `On the lugger! see!' Before Forrestal could arrest him, or anticipate the young midshipman's movements, he had sprung from the gangway into the dark waters below.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER II. The Recognition. Forrestal stood an instant transfixed with surprise at this sudden movement of his young friend, and then believing that the memory and recital of his sad history had turned his brain, he gave aloud the startling cry, `a man overboard!' and sprang into the water to rescue him. The cry was taken up simultaneously by others on deck, and the quarter-master, who was standing near the wheel, ran aft and cut away the life-buoy, while the officer of the deck, seeing Forrestal also plunge in, leaped into the third cutter which was at the quarter davits, the boats being all hoisted up, and followed by a part of its crew was lowered into the water. Forrestal, however, reached Harry as he was swimming, regardless of the cries and of his presence, towards the lugger, with the outlay of every sinew. `Come, my dear boy,' said his friend, with a kindly smile as he grasped him firmly by the arm, `you must not escape from the ship this way!' `But it—don't detain me, good Forrestal! I must—' `But, Harry, you must return to the sloop! What can have driven you overboard in this mad fashion? Here is the cutter right upon us! You must get in with me, and then, once on board and in your warm hammock, you may talk. Do n't resist me, Harry.' But the young midshipman seeing the boat almost upon them, loosened Forrestal's hold and dove deep out of sight. `He is swimming shoreward under the surface,' cried the lieutenant, standing up in the boat and watching his course beneath the water. `Forrestal take hold of the gunwale, and, men, give a couple of short strokes and we shall reach him as he rises.' The cutter glided on about twenty feet when the head of the youth, as he ascended to the top of the water, struck with violence under her starboard bow. Forrestal, who was holding by one hand to one of the heart-shaped `fenders' of the boat and swimming with the other, immediately caught him beneath the arms and raised him out of the water so that those in the boat could grasp him, when he was immediately lifted in, but insensible, from the blow he had received. Forrestal getting in after him, took him in his arms, and the cutter was immediately pulled back under the sloop's quarter, the davits hooked, and she was hoisted to her place with all in her. Harry was conveyed by Forrestal to his own hammock, and there, by the aid of the surgeon, every means were used to resuscitate him; but it was three hours before he showed any signs of returning sensibility. `That was a severe blow, Mr. Forrestal,' said the surgeon, who was holding his pulse, and watching returning life.' `Yes, doctor. If I had not caught him in my arms as I did, he would have sunk to the bottom like lead!' `Can you account in any way for his throwing himself into the water?' `No; unless from the excess of grief at the remembrance of his unhappy fate, and that of his lost sister; but I will not now explain what I mean; briefly, he was, in childhood, mysteriously separated from an only sister, whose present fate is a source of constant anxiety to him; and it was while he was recounting to me some of the facts connected with her separation from him, he suddenly made a leap into the water!' `It is very strange. His brain, perhaps, was for the moment a little unsettled,' said the surgeon, shaking his head. `I fear so,' responded Forrestal, sorrowfully. `Poor Harry! — he opens his eyes, sir!' `Yes, he is fast coming to. Please hand me that lamp from the table, Mr. Forrestal.' The surgeon placed the light before Harry's eyes, and looked closely into them. The youth closed them slowly, and heavily sighed. `The expression is soft and natural,' answered the doctor, looking at the lieutenant, who was watching this act with intense anxiety. `I see nothing to indicate insanity.' `Thank God!' exclaimed the generous-hearted officer. `Mr. Forrestal!' murmured the lips of the youth. `I am here, dear Harry!' answered the officer, bending over to catch his words. Harry opened his eyes, smiled faintly, and sought to grasp the hand of his friend. `You are better, Harry?' `Yes; I feel much better! Am I not in your state-room, Mr. Forrestal?' he asked, looking round, and trying to recollect himself. `Yes, Harry. I am glad to see you are reviving. We have all been very anxious about you.' `Thank you!' he answered, pressing his hand warmly. `I am quite well now. You need not hold my pulse, Doctor Fosdick. I shall soon be quite well, Mr. Forrestal.' `Well, Harry?' `How long have I been here?' `Four hours, nearly.' Instantly the cheek of the youth became flushed. `I wish to say a word to you. Bend down! — no, you need not; you see I can rise and sit up. There, you perceive how well I am, doctor. Please let me say a word alone to Mr. Forrestal!' He spoke with such earnestness and emotion, that the surgeon hesitated a moment, placed his hand upon his pulse, and then laid it upon his temple. `Doctor, I am quite well now. If I am worse, Mr. Forrestal shall call you,' he said, with earnestness. The surgeon took a second keen glance into his eyes, and then said, with a smile, `Well, I will let you have a few words with your friend; but I forbid you talking much. I hold you responsible, Mr. Forrestal.' `I will see that he does not say much, for I know rest and quiet are most needful for him; and as he spoke, he with a gentle hand put back the chestnut curls from the young man's forehead, with the tender, soothing air, which a brother would show towards a loving and beloved sister. Harry listened till he heard the doctor's step cross to the farther door of the ward-room, and then with both hands he took hold of the hand of Forrestal, which lay in his, and said, in a deep, trembling tone, `Mr. Forrestal, you must think I have acted very strangely. I will explain to you.' `Not now — to-morrow. It is near midnight. Seven bells are now striking. You should sleep, dear Harry. To-morrow you may tell me all.' `I conceive that I must have sunk or fainted in the water after I dived away from you,' he said, as if all at once reflecting upon being where he was. `Do I not owe you my life, sir? How was it?' `As you came up to the surface, your head struck under the bows of the cutter with violence, and the shock rendered you insensible.' `That accounts for my head — for the great pain in it.' `You must be quiet, my dear Harry.' `No. Let me first thank you for my life: for I know it must have been you who saved me, when I was rendered insensible,' said Harry, looking up into his face with that generous emotion, which sweet gratitude alone can impress upon the countenance. `Well, and this renders you more dear to me.' `I am so happy having such a friend as you a sir. But I must tell you what caused me to spring overboard as I did. But first, is the lugger anchored there?' `I do not know. I suppose so, unless she weighed with the tide.' `O, see sir, see!' `I will, Harry, but —' `Do n't hesitate, but sit down, and I will first tell you, for if she is not there now, all is lost! Do you know, sir,' he continued, with the most excited manner, his cheek flushed and his eye kindling, `do you know, sir, that I saw that man!' `What man?' asked Forrestal, now quite convinced that poor Harry's brain was truly affected. There was no doubt that his thoughts were yet a little unsteady, from the effects of the blow he had received, but they were faithful to the one subject he had now upon his mind. `The man that carried my sister and myself on board the brig in the river, when we were children!' he answered, with great earnestness. `Saw him, Harry?' asked Forrestal, with an expression upon his face, that told how sadly he was convinced that the mind of his young friend was wandering — wandering fitfully upon the past. `Yes, Mr. Forrestal. It was that which made me spring overboard; for I felt, that if I did not reach him then, I should, perhaps, never see him again. I immediately leaped into the water to swim to the lugger, with the purpose of seizing him, and demanding my sister!' Forrestal looked a moment on the face of his young friend, with a gaze of mingled surprise and incredulity. There was no sign of insanity in his eyes, whatever there might be in his words; though his manner was deeply excited and earnest. `Harry,' said he, seriously, and fixing a steady, observant gaze upon him; `do you mean to say you saw a man on board the lugger, who resembled the individual who took your sister away?' `I saw the very man, Mr. Forrestal,' answered Harry, with very great positiveness. `On the deck of the lugger?' `Yes, sir. While I was talking with you, did you not see a man, with bushy grey hair, reddish whiskers, high, broad shoulders, and tall in stature, come out of the cuddy?' `Yes, I noticed him, and was struck with his savage appearance!' `That was the man, sir. The moment he appeared in full view on the lugger's deck, I recognized him; for his image has never been absent from my thoughts. As soon as I recognized that it was he, without saying a word to you, I impulsively leaped into the water.' `But, my dear Harry, it is eleven years since you saw him, and then you were but six or seven years of age. Time must have changed the man who beguiled Isidore from her home, so that now you would not be able to identify him.' `This man I could recognize and identify had he reached eighty years, sir. It is the man! O, sir, will you believe me, and have him arrested, that I may once more behold my sister, or know what has become of her?' `My dear Harry, this seems too extraordinary a circumstance to be the truth. Yet I will believe you, for nothing but a positive recognition of the man can account for your extraordinary conduct in leaping from the gangway into the water to swim to the lugger; I thought you crazy.' `Thanks, thanks, sir, for believing me. I am not crazy, save with joy and hope. Haste, sir, to the deck, and see if the lugger is still there; and if she is, let me board her with you. He must not escape from me, Mr. Forrestal. I must demand my sister of him.' `He shall not escape, dear boy. Whether he be the man or not, he shall be brought before you, and you shall be satisfied.' `The lugger, if she is not moved, lies in our power, and nothing will be easier, dear Mr. Forrestal, than to take him from her and bring him on board. Oh! let me go on deck.' `You are not yet sufficiently recovered, Harry. It will endanger your health to be exposed to the night air. In the morning, you shall be on deck. Here is the surgeon, with his finger up.' `Ah, Lieutenant Forrestal, you have had too long a talk with my patient. You see his cheek is like a peony, and I dare say his pulse is full one hundred and ten. No, it is but ninety. This is not so bad as I feared.' `Please remain with him, doctor; I will soon return,' said Forrestal; and the next instant he was on the gun deck. He hurried to the gangway to look for the lugger; but as the ebb tide had swung the vessel of war round with her head in an opposite direction, he did not think of the fact until he saw the towers and roofs of the city in the distance, instead of the Castle, which was now behind him. The lugger, it 3 will be remembered, lay in the shadow of the rock, upon which the Moro Castle was built. He crossed the ship's deck to the gangway, and with a quick, searching gaze, looked for the lugger where she had lain at sundown. After a few moments' observation, he was satisfied that she was no longer there. This conviction was a deep disappointment to him, for he had come to a firm belief that Harry was right. `Mr. Veryl!' he said to a young reefer, who had been walking up and down the waist smoking a finely-flavored Havana cigar, but who had now arrested himself in his mechanical promenade to watch the hurried movements of Lieutenant Forrestal; `do you know what has become of the lugger that lay at anchor half a cable's length from us in shore at sunset?' `She weighed at the turn of the tide, sir,' answered the reefer, touching his cap, and removing his cigar from his lips. `When was that?' `About the second bell, sir.' `At nine o'clock; and now it is twelve! She has been gone three hours. Did she stand out of the harbor?' `Yes, sir. I was leaning over the hammock-nettings watching her movements; for at one time, as the wind baffled, I thought she would fall aboard of us. Yet they managed her well.' `Did you see many men on her deck?' `Five, sir.' `Spaniards?' `I could not tell in the dark, though I heard Spanish spoken, and that too by one who had an English tongue in his head.' `Are you sure that it was an Englishman?' asked Forrestal, quickly. `Or American, sir,' responded Mr. Veryl, replacing his cigar a moment, to keep it alive, and then removing it. `I know you speak the language well, Mr. Veryl; but it requires a nice ear to detect Spanish, when spoken by an English tongue!' `I cannot mistake the accent, sir. The man, whoever he was, was the skipper of the lugger; for the orders all came from him. He did not speak loud, but I could hear distinctly his words.' `And the lugger stood out of the harbor?' `Yes, sir.' `How is the wind?' `About south by east, and is outside five or six knot breeze, I should think, sir, from the way the lugger showed her paces after clearing the harbor.' `Then you watched her?' `For about a mile I could distinguish her; but she rapidly went out of sight.' `What course did she steer?' `I should think about northeast, sir.' `Thank you, Veryl.' Forrestal then remained a moment in deep reflection, while Veryl embraced the opportunity to revive his expiring cigar, which his courtesy — for Mr. Veryl was a very fastidiously polite reefer, of eighteen years — would not suffer him to smoke while addressed by his superior officer. `Did you notice if any one left her before she weighed?' asked Forrestal: `No, sir, I did not. I was only induced to give the craft my attention from hearing their noise in getting their anchor.' Forrestal made no further remark, but walked aft at a quick pace, and descended into the cabin. `What can be in the wind now?' asked another midshipman, who had heard part of the conversation, and the inquiries of the lieutenant. `That I can't tell, unless the lugger has been bucaneering,' answered Veryl, speaking with his cigar in his mouth, and with his laced cap thrown back from his brow with an air. `It is n't that! Forrestal has something in his head for her. She has been doing some mischief; or, perhaps he wants her to help him on this cruise that is whispered about.' `It may be so. But the clipper-schooner is no doubt to be ordered on that duty. This was the rumor in the steerage at supper, you know, Rogers!' `Steerage rumors are not bulletins. But there is something in the wind all round; and we shall know, before either of us are twenty-four hours older, something more both about this pretty clipper under our quarter, as well as this lugger that has spread her black wings and flown seaward.' `What do you imagine the clipper-schooner has been ordered out from Baltimore for?' asked Veryl, taking a Bermuda grass case from his side pocket, and deliberately drawing forth a fresh cigar. `Take one' Rogers.' `Thank you, Fred, I smoke only rapellitos,' responded the reefer, a round-faced, short young gentleman, with a bob-tarpaulin, cocked knowingly over his larboard eye; `and, besides, I have a fresh quid of pig in just now. Well, I can't tell what she is here for, unless it is, as the first luff was overheard to say, to cruise in among the Bahama Keys, where the sloop wont go.' `That is my opinion, though nothing certain has come out. Every thing is kept so close under hatches in the big cabin.' `We shall know soon; for the schooner was provisioned with fresh tuck from shore this afternoon, and that means anchor a-weigh and blue water!' `Yes. And we are to sail too, soon, if that is a sign, for we had at least two bullocks in beef come aboard to-day, and vegetables and fruit enough to freight a Yankee skipper. What a long craft that schooner is!' `A picture,' answered Rogers, changing his quid from his right cheek to his left, and taking a closer view of the little vessel, that lay quietly at anchor a little ways off the starboard quarter. `I would like to take command of her myself!' `I should n't care to take a holyday cruise in her, if I thought we should fall in with some of these bucaneering wreckers, and especially the fellow they talk so much about, that holds out the false lights that lately have wrecked three of our best merchantmen.' `That would be a spirited cruise, Fred. I would like the capturing of that fellow, and I believe Old Par has something of this sort in his eye.' 3 * `Eight bells,' cried the officer of the deck. `Eight bells,' repeated Rogers, passing the words forward, and at the same instant the deep-toned ship's bell tolled out, in quick double-strokes, the hour of midnight. `I am not sorry to turn in, Fred,' said Rogers, as he prepared to dodge into the steerage, as the relief came on deck. `I shall wait up a few minutes, for I want to see what Forrestal will have to say when he comes out of the cabin.' `Hark! what a ringing of eight bells there is!' They both paused a moment, to listen to the wild and startling sounds that broke upon the night from every part of the harbor. From ship to ship the hoarse midnight call resounded, followed by three strokes of their bells in every variety of key, from that of the small war-schooner to that of the ship-of-the-line; while, mingling with it, came swelling solemnly upon the breeze, the deep tones of the Cathedral clock in the city, slowly sounding from its lofty tower; and, far up in the sky, as it were, was heard the shrill cry of the Spanish sentinel, upon the Castle battlement, proclaiming `All is well.' In a few minutes the sounds, one after another, ceased, and the reefer was about to disappear to throw himself into his hammock, when Veryl said, warningly, `Do not make a noise, Rogers, if you can help it, as Harry is, you know, in Forrestal's cot, and only a bulk-head separates you from him.' `True; and what, Veryl, is the matter with Harry? Do you suppose he was crazy when he went overboard in that style?' `I can't tell. It is a mystery to me.' `The doctor says he must have been a little out.' `I should think he was a little in,' answered Veryl, with a slight smile at his pun. `Good, Veryl. But it is too bad to joke upon Harry's ducking. You would make a pun upon your grandmother's coffin!' `To be sure I should, if she had a bad cold!' `There, you are at it again! Good night.' And the reefer disappeared down into the steerage, and in two minutes was sound asleep in his hammock, so lightly do the cares and events of life lay upon the minds of young sailors. Veryl stood a moment on the spot where his friend had left him, and then advanced a few paces aft and remained solicitously looking at the entrance of the cabin, as if expecting the re-appearance of Forrestal; for he hoped he might yet hear something further from him in reference to the interest he had taken in the departure of the lugger. But after waiting some five minutes, and hearing nothing further from him, he turned and reluctantly descended to his hammock. Before throwing himself into it, he went to see how Harry was. He found him, with the doctor seated by his cot. `I thought it was Mr. Forrestal,' said Harry, in a tone of disappointment. `Have you seen him, Veryl?' `Yes, he came on deck, and then went into the captain's cabin.' `Do you — did you — that is — is the lugger —?' `You must keep quiet, Harry,' said the doctor, firmly. `You must not talk. Pulse up to ninety-seven, and hard.' `I will not remain here, doctor!' answered Harry, very positively. `I am as well as you are! I must know and see!' he said, earnestly. `You shall know and see, but you must get well first,' answered the surgeon, kindly, but firmly laying his hand upon him to detain him, for he had sprung to his feet. `The lugger, — is it there still, Veryl?' he asked, with singular earnestness. `No. It weighed three hours ago, and put to sea,' answered Veryl, not a little surprised at the interest taken also by him, in this obscure craft. `Gone! Then he is lost forever!' cried Harry, almost with a shriek; and burying his face in his hands, he fell back nearly insensible upon the cot. `He is surely crazy,' said Doctor Fosdick, with sympathy. `It is a plain case of madness, Mr. Veryl. He must lose, at the least, sixteen ounces of blood, without delay.' `Poor Harry!' said Veryl, sadly. `Such a noble fellow!' `Poor boy! mad as a March hare!' answered the good-hearted doctor, in a husky voice; and wiping the rim of one of his glasses, which had caught a tear that was stealing down his brown cheek, he replaced them upon the bridge of his long nose, and prepared to bleed him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER III. The Clipper. Forrestal, on descending from the deck, stopped in a sort of vestibule or hall, at the foot of the stairs, from which a richly-gilt mahogany door led into the main cabin occupied by the commander of the sloop-of-war. He tapped at the door twice before he was heard, when he was ordered to `come in.' `Ah, Mr. Forrestal, it is you,' said Captain Parmenter, who, wrapped in a brocade dressing-gown and his feet thrust into Persian slippers, was seated by a table that was draped with a scarlet cloth, and strewn with books and papers and partly covered by a very elegant inlaid writing-desk. The cabin in which he was seated was spacious and panneled with rose-wood and maple, polished in the highest manner, and relieved by beads of burnished gold, and pilasters of marble placed at intervals, surmounted by gilded Corinthian capitals. Though small in dimensions, nothing could be more magnificent than this nautical saloon. On either side of it a door opened into a state-room containing French couches overarched by damask canopies. The furniture of this tasteful cabin consisted of two lounges covered with thick crimson velvet, and two luxurious easy-chairs, with the circular table at which the occupant was seated in one of them. A large mirror occupied the space above the transum between the two dead-lights, and over the table hung a very elegant bronze lamp in the form of a nautilus. `I have taken the liberty to intrude upon you, sir, but' — `No intrusion, Mr. Forrestal,' said Captain Parmenter, with the courtesy of a perfectly bred man. `You are so assiduous in your duties on deck, that it is rarely I have the pleasure of a voluntary visit from you; besides, I was just thinking about sending my servant to you. Be seated, sir! How is poor young Carneil? The doctor was in awhile since, and said, that although he was in no danger of his life, he was still in the same state in which I left him two hours ago!' `He is now, I am happy to say, sir, quite out of danger. He has not only recovered his senses, but spoken rationally, and seems to be quite free from any alarming symptoms!' `Was he rational, quite? Did he betray no signs of that painful condition of the mind which the doctor has hinted at as the cause of his leaping into the water?' `No, sir. It was from me the doctor got this idea, for I was the only one present and conversing with him when he made the plunge. I then believed, and expressed to the doctor my opinion, that it was an act of temporary insanity.' `But you do not think so, now?' `No, sir.' `It is very strange what should have led him to do it, said Captain Parmenter, thoughtfully; but I am glad the poor boy is doing well. He shall be removed to my cabin.' `He is quite comfortable where he is, sir, and I think will be on deck in the morning, in his usual health.' `Well, that is favorable. Now, Mr. Forrestal, let me talk with you about this clipper-cruise. I was just about to send for you for the purpose.' Forrestal was burning with impatience to communicate to his commanding officer what was on his mind, and which had brought him so abruptly into his presence at that late hour; but the courtesies of the service rendered him silent till he should have first heard what the captain had to say to him; and he moreover secretly trusted, that what he had to propose might forward that which he himself had in view in reference to the lugger. `You are aware, Mr. Forrestal,' said the captain in a serious manner, `that I have in view a cruise on the Bahamas, and I have already made known to you that the clipper-schooner, just arrived from the States, is to act as a tender.' `Yes, sir.' `It is my intention, as I hinted to you this morning, to place you in command of her, having confidence in your ability as well as in your judgment and discretion. Forrestal bowed, and Captain Parmenter resumed in the same quiet, conversational tone. `My orders are to cruise between Nassau and the Hole-in-the-Wall, and endeavor to ascertain the haunts of the wreckers, (or rather now to be called pirates, for their late deeds,) who were guilty of plundering the packet-ships and robbing the passengers, of which so much has been said lately; and I have particular instructions to endeavor to ascertain where, by what means, and by whom the false decoy-light near Abaco has been displayed, by which two of these vessels were deceived and cast away. My orders came out in the clipper, though I had some intimation from the Department, that I was to be ordered on some such service, and hence my delay here. You have not been on board the clipper?' `No, sir, not yet. She is a very fine-looking craft, and must sail well.' `She is. I am told by the masters'-mate, who brought her out, that she skips over the waves like a gull. She draws but eight feet, though her length is so very great for her breadth of beam, she looks twice her tonnage, which is but one hundred and ten!' `When do you weigh, sir?' `At noon, to-morrow.' `Have you' — Here Forrestal checked himself, and appeared embarrassed what to say, as if he was about to ask something that he shrunk from proposing. `Why do you hesitate, Mr. Forrestal?' asked the captain, blandly; `I have seen you have had something on your mind all along while I have been talking: out with it, sir!' `I was about to ask if you had any objections to my getting under weigh with the schooner to-night?' `To-night! Mr. Forrestal? To-night! and alone?' `Pardon me, sir, I should first have explained to you my motive. It is connected with poor Harry's leap into the water!' `Let me hear it, sir,' answered the commander, with a look of surprise and curiosity. `How your sailing 4 to-night can have any thing to do with Carneil's affair, I cannot conceive. But I am curious to hear.' `You are, I believe, sir, acquainted with his singular history, Captain Parmenter?' `Yes; and once began to relate it to you.' `He has told me himself, sir. We were standing together, at sunset, enjoying the beautiful harbor-scene around us, when from some circumstance that occurred he began to give me a relation of the events of his earlier life. It was a strange and interesting story, to which I listened; and I need not assure you, sir, to whom these extraordinary facts are known, that I became most deeply interested.' `You could not be otherwise than so, Mr. Forrestal,' said Captain Parmenter, in a sad tone of voice. `I never think of the affair without pity. What do you imagine was the motive of that fellow, who abducted the lovely little girl, his sister? To me the whole subject is one of painful mystery. Harry has deeply interested me, not only from the peculiar circumstances connected with his life, but from the many noble traits of character in mind and heart he daily developes; I never knew a youth who promises so fairly to be heard in the world. That he has come of good blood, is plain from his spirited head, his proud brow and eye, as well as from the delicate, yet by no means feminine, shape of his hands and limbs. He is a capital sailor, and seems to take to the sea by instinct; and I would not hesitate to bet, if there was any way of proving it, that his father lived longer on the blue water than on the green land. But what is your opinion of this abduction?' `I can form none satisfactorily. If both children had been desired, then there might have been some motive based upon property, which, if they had remained, they would have inherited.' `I have thought of the same idea, and the same objection, of one only being taken away, voluntarily occurred! I would give a thousand dollars to get at the bottom of this mystery.' `I think we are likely to, sir,' said Forrestal, with animation. `How? In what way?' demanded the captain, with eager inquiry. `I have told you that Harry was relating to me his story, as we were standing together on the side of the ship looking towards the Moro.' `Well.' `Between us and the Moro lay at anchor a small lugger, that dropped down there a little before sunset.' `I remember seeing her, and thought she looked amazingly like one of the Bahama wreckers; and I thought I would in the morning send for the skipper, and see what I could get out of him touching the doings of some of his brethren on the Banks. But what of him?' `Harry had just ended his recital by saying, in reply to a question from me, that if he saw that man who took him from home, he should recognize him, under any disguise. We both had our eyes turned in the direction of the shallop at the moment, and all at once, while he was speaking, he uttered an extraordinary cry, and plunged instantly from the gangway into the water. Supposing he must have been seized with a momentary madness caused by grief and despair, I plunged in after him, and we were so fortunate as to rescue him, though not without injury.' `Yes, Mr. Forrestal, and you deserve great praise for your act. But I am impatient to hear more; for I see you have something strange yet to tell connected with the affair.' `Yes. Until about a quarter of an hour ago, when Harry came to himself, I believed that he had jumped overboard from the impulse of temporary insanity!' `And what was the cause, Mr. Forrestal?' asked Captain Parmenter, earnestly. `You will scarce believe what I am to say, for I was first incredulous myself, until firmly convinced by Harry's positive manner and the sincerity of his air, that he was right! He declares positively that the cause of his conduct was the recognizing in a man on board the shallop as his eye glanced that way, the features and form of the very individual who had taken him and his sister from their childhood's home! That he obeyed the first impulse of his feelings and leaped overboard to swim to the shallop!' `Can this be possible, Mr. Forrestal?' exclaimed the captain, springing from his seat, in the strongest excitement. `Harry positively asserts that he is not mistaken; that the features of this man, who tore him from his native land, are engraven upon his memory, and that the man he beheld on the deck of the shallop is the same man!' `This is most wonderful!' `It is, indeed, sir!' `Let me see Carneil! I will question him! But what is this confusion in the companion-way? Here he is in person, and pursued by the doctor!' he cried, as Harry burst into the cabin and threw himself upon Forrestal with a perfect abandonment. `What is this? Doctor Fosdick, explain, sir!' demanded the captain, as the surgeon arrested himself in the door and stood there wistfully eyeing his patient, yet afraid to intrude into the cabin, his right hand armed with a lancet and his left flourishing a strip of linen bandage. `Sir, my patient has eloped and I pursued him,' answered the discomfited medicine-man. `Mr. Forrestal, he would have bled me, and I am perfectly well!' cried Harry. `I had no sooner pricked the cuticle of his arm with my lancet point, Captain Parmenter, than he came to, and was up the steerage ladder in a trice. He is mad, sir, stark mad, or he would quietly have suffered himself to be bled!' `That is no good proof, doctor. I will vouch for the sanity of my young friend. Let him remain with me to-night, I will be responsible. Good night, doctor!' The surgeon took the polite bow of the commander as a civil request for him to retire, and wishing the two officers a `good night,' in return, he closed the cabin door and departed to his own state-room. `Now, my dear boy,' said Captain Parmenter, kindly, `we both know, Mr. Forrestal and myself, that you are not mad! The doctor we will suffer to remain, for the present, in his own opinion. Mr. Forrestal has told me what led you to leap into the water, 4* and it is very naturally explained under the circumstances. I am glad you appear now so well over your sad accident of hitting the boat. Now, be composed, Harry, for I see your soul is almost ready to fly out at your lips!' `But, sir, the shallop has weighed!' `Weighed!' `Yes, sir. This is what has roused me again. O, sir, if he now escapes us I may never see him again!' `You did not tell me the lugger had gone from her anchorage, Mr. Forrestal.' `I was just about to do so when Harry came in as he did. This was my motive in desiring to put to sea to-night, that I might overtake her!' `Oh! good, good Forrestal!' cried Harry, almost embracing his friend; and then his eyes, fixed on his commander, hung upon his answer. `Harry, let me first ask you if you are sure you are not mistaken in this man's identity?' `No, sir. I had no sooner fixed my eyes upon him than I knew him! He was not much changed, save that he looked older and grayer, sir!' `You are positive!' `It was the man, sir, the very man!' cried Harry, with tearful earnestness. `O, sir, if you would let the sloop get — but I am of too little importance for a sloop-of-war to weigh anchor on my account!' `The sloop need not go in pursuit. Does any one of the watch know which course she took after getting an offing, Mr. Forrestal? Was she seen?' `She stood to the north and east; so Veryl told me, as he was watching her when she moved out from her moorings. She sailed with the first ebb and has been gone near four hours now!' `I am satisfied you are right, Harry, or you could not look and speak so positively, not to allude to the fact of your springing overboard so readily and impulsively. I shall therefore act accordingly. The clipper-schooner that is anchored near us is to act as a tender to the sloop in a cruise, and Mr. Forrestal is to take command of her. Both vessels were to sail together to-morrow noon; but as you are of great importance, my dear boy, notwithstanding your modest doubts, the schooner shall weigh as soon as Mr. Forrestal gets on board of her. Do not look so pale, Harry. You may accompany him, for nothing could be done without you, you know! Now get your kit ready, if you feel strong enough; if not, the steward shall help you!' `I can get together what things I shall want in a few minutes, sir. I am well and strong, now that I know we are going in chase of the shallop. I do not know what to say to you for your goodness, Captain Parmenter!' `Say nothing, my dear boy; only catch and bring that fellow back safe under hatches, and I will have the screws ready to clap on him, to make him confess all his diabolical villainy!' Harry left the cabin, his bosom swelling with new and strange feelings, to prepare for a transfer to the clipper, while the steward, by his order, began to get ready Mr. Forrestal's chest, with his nautical books, charts, quadrants, spy-glass, &amp;c. `Now, Mr. Forrestal,' said Captain Parmenter, as Harry left them together, `you will enter upon and pursue this chase with all diligence. There is no question but that Harry has, by God's good providence, seen the very man! Providence will aid you in carrying through the matter to a successful issue, if Harry has been right in the outset. I shall put to sea to-morrow noon at the ebb. If I am correct in my suspicions this fellow is a wrecker, and has probably been in port here to dispose of the more valuable portions of cargo he has either picked up on the beach or pilfered from some wreck. If Harry's man is indeed in her, she is more likely to be one of the very piratical fellows I am ordered to hunt out of their hiding-places among the Keys. The shallop will, therefore, doubtless take you in the direction of the Banks, as Veryl says she steered a northerly course after getting outside. I shall also stand for the Banks to-morrow. I will give you full time for your cruise — twenty days — and at the end of this period I shall rendezvous at Key-West, where you will then meet me and report progress. If you are successful in capturing the shallop in less time, and this man is on board, you will join me either at Nassau or in the neighborhood of Abaco, where I shall cruise for several days. You have now my instructions! You can get on board as soon as you please!' `I will not delay a moment, sir,' answered Forrestal, taking up his naval cap from the ottoman. `The manner in which this skipper has stolen off, leads me to suspect that he must have recognized Harry while he was in the water!' `I have been thinking the very same thing, sir,' answered Forrestal, arresting his hand upon the knob of the door, which he had partly opened when the captain spoke. `Yet there must have been such an alteration in Harry that I question if he could have identified him!' `Perhaps this man — and I think on reflection it is more than probable, perhaps he has kept this youth in his eye from the first. It is not likely he would willingly lose sight of him altogether. He must have known that he did not perish on the steps, and that Mr. Carneil took him in. It appears to me that he must have kept his eye upon him, and I should not be surprised if his dropping down here from the inner harbor and anchoring so close to us had something to do with his knowledge that Harry was on board the sloop!' `Such a supposition is a very natural one, sir; and if he anchored here with any designs upon him, he would very naturally move again as soon as he well could, conscious of having been recognized, and fearful of the consequences when Harry, whom he must have seen, was taken on board insensible, should come to himself and give the reason for his conduct!' `You are right, Mr. Forrestal, I am now firmly convinced in my own mind that Harry saw the true man. This suggestion explains the whole. When shall you weight?' `Within twenty minutes!' `God give you success. Good-by, sir,' added the captain, shaking his hand. `And you, Harry, good-by too! Are you all ready, my dear boy?' `Yes, Captain Parmenter!' `Then God bless you! Good night!' The captain accompanied them to the deck, and in a quiet manner they put off from the sloop, and in three minutes stood on the deck of the clipper. In five more her anchor was atrip, her sails were loosed and sheeted home, and, gracefully swinging round with her prow to the sea, the beautiful vessel went flying ocean-ward, and was soon lost to the eye of the commander in the hazy indistinctness of distance and night.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER IV. The Wrecker. We shall now take our readers on board the shallop, not following her from the harbor, but letting her proceed on her course for the present, and go back to the morning of the day on which she dropped down alongside of the sloop-of-war. The shallop, at the time we are to visit her, lay at anchor quite up to the city above the quay, and before the entrance of a small inlet or dock that made in close under the walls of an old guard-house, which was now converted into a pulperia, or wine tavern, and a famed resort for Spanish boatmen and sailors of the worst description. It was about nine o'clock on the morning of this day, that a man a little above the common height, with broad massive shoulders, and whose age might be about fifty, came up from below the shallop's decks, and looked around him with a quick, observing glance. There was, to a close observer of men, distinguishable about him an air like that of one who had once mingled in good society; a look of intelligence, education, and polish, though now nearly obliterated by his present savage appearance and costume. His dress was that peculiar to many of the Bahama wreckers — a red and blue striped woollen shirt, with loose canvass trowsers, and a sash tied about his waist instead of suspenders. His head was surmounted by a crimson woollen cap, with the pointed top hanging down over the ear; and beneath it escaped masses of mingled black and gray hair, the latter predominating. His features were bold, yet repulsive, and decidedly English. There dwelt upon his face an expression of settled fierceness, to use this word for want of one of closer meaning, and his mustachoed lip seemed habitually compressed with a look of hostile defiance. His powerful frame and malignity of aspect made him a man to be feared if he possessed power over his species. He was without weapons save a seaman's sheath-knife stuck in his sash. The shallop was a small lugger, her deck flush, and about thirty paces from stem to stern, steered by a tiller, and rigged with fore and main-sail, with a stump mast over the taffrail for carrying when before the wind a square-sail, called a `driver.' She was very broad in the beam, her width amidship being nearly half her length. She had a hold for the stowage of cargo, and the hatchway served both for entrance to it and for access to the after part of the vessel, where the skipper lodged, in a small room separated from the main hold by a low bulk-head. There was a place in the forward part of the craft for her crew. She was apparently very old, seemed once to have been painted black, but was now throughout of a rusty brown hue, and her canvass was of the same dingy color. Her rigging was much worn, and in some places was repaired by strips of raw hide instead of rope. Upon the forward deck was a fire-place of bricks, in which 5 a fire was now burning and over which an Indian half-blood, descended from the aborigines of the islands, was cooking a breakfast savory of garlie. These two were the only persons visible on board the shallop. Her boat was absent, and probably had taken all the crew; and for the return of this he seemed to be watching, as his glance was directed towards the landing-place, that was shut in by overhanging Spanish houses, which threatened each moment to fall into the sluggish water of the gloomy dock. There was an angle in the pier, and a vessel similar to his own lying in the range of his vision, so that he could not see the steps of the landing from his deck. `Hoyo!' `Señor?' responded the half-breed. `Throw yourself into the water and swim to the pier, and hasten those loiterers with the boat. I would go on shore.' The lith Indian was about to throw off his gingham shirt, when he was arrested by the voice of the skipper. `Stay! they are coming.' With a swift pull, a small canoe-shaped boat came from the recesses of the dock and rapidly approached the shallop. It was pulled by two men, a third being seated in the stern. They were all Spaniards, and were garbed much like their captain, save that one of them instead of a woollen cap wore a broad-brimmed palm hat, deeply shading his brows. This person was he who sat in the stern of the boat. His age was about twenty-four, his features handsome naturally, but marred by that peculiar expression which vice and crime indelibly impresses upon the countenance, even of the most beautiful, if beauty can be without virtue and honor. `How is this, Vique?' demanded the skipper sternly, addressing him in Spanish. `Said I not I must be on shore at eight?' `I had some difficulty, Captain Ingles, in finding the agent Davila,' answered Vique, as he sprang lightly on deck. `And will he take all?' `He wants all the articles, but demurs at the price. However, he waits to see you in the pulperia of the old guard-house, to pay you the money.' `He shall not have an article for one marovedi less than the price I have set upon them. Remain in the boat, nombres, and pull me ashore. Vique, you see that all is ready for sailing, for I shall depart in an hour; for it is not safe to lay too long here.' `No, Señor; it was whispered to me by more than one buen comrada last night, after I had landed the goods, and stored them in the place you named, and gone into the wine-shop, that there was a strong feeling growing against all wreckers on account of—you know what, Capitan,' said Vique, significantly. `Innocent as we are, we may be suspected, and I am quite willing to leave Havana over the shallop's taffrail as soon as you give the order.' `These rumors are idle, for nothing positive can be known touching us,' answered the skipper, with disdain; `still, as we shall get through our affairs as soon as I have adjusted this matter with Señor Davila, have all ready to start as soon as I come on board.' Thus speaking, `Ingles,' as he was called by Vique, entered the boat and was pulled in the direction of the sunken stairway. On reaching it he stepped on land and said, `Leave not the boat nor your oars until my return. Lay the boat's head towards the shallop, and be ready to pull back to her at a moment's notice.' He then ascended the steps between black slimy walls of stone, and passing through an arch at the top, where once had been placed a gate, the hinges of which only remained, he found himself in one of the narrowest and most obscure streets of Havana. Ranges of dingy tenements, of stone or brick, stuccoed and grown mouldy with time and moisture, stood on either hand, and occupied chiefly as wine-shops, gambling-rooms, with a cock-pit at intervals of every dozen doors. Opposite to the arch rose, black and sombre, the strong walls of a prison, with only a single window upon the street, but this full thirty feet in height, and strongly grated from the pavement to the roof. It looked into a vast common hall, in which he could see full a hundred prisoners assembled, and from which came sounds almost infernal. The tall window was also filled with prisoners, from the bottom to the top, standing on the cross-bars of iron, one over the other, gazing into the street, talking with their acquaintances, begging money from the passers by, or scattering oaths and vulgar witticisms upon every one going along. As Ingles came into this street he drew his cap over his eyes, so that the hanging top would droop over and conceal his features, and, without noticing the calls to him for money that proceeded from the prison window, he passed along rapidly till he came to about the ninth door from the arch, where he entered, glad to escape more than one voice, hailing familiar recognition of him from the carcel. The place he entered was a Spanish tavern, containing a bar at one extremity lined with shelves of wine-bottles, and around the walls many little tables for the guests. There were but three persons in the room, and two of these were men-of-war's men; the third individual was seated at a table in a retired nook, as if to escape observation. Ingles, on entering, looked keenly round. His eye fell on this man, who was a short, fat little Spaniard, in a soiled red-velvet waistcoat, a remarkably long queue, and very dirty ruffles at his wrists and bosom. He had a pair of iron spectacles upon the table by his side, and also a cup of wine before him, with a piece of bread and a garlic half eaten. `Señor Davila, good morning,' said Ingles, approaching him; and, taking a seat directly opposite to him, he bent upon him his large gray eyes for an instant, and then added, `Vique tells me you like the goods but decline the full payment!' `The goods are good goods, Señor Ingles, and are precisely what I can turn to profit in my shop on the Plaza; but if I pay you the twelve hundred dollars aggregate you demand, I can make no profit at all.' `We have traded before and had no words, Davila, and I desire none now. Those goods cost me much! They cost men their lives! Their price has been blood, and I swear to you, por Dios! that I will not abate the tenth part of a peso! I know the value of the goods, and that you can pay this and yet continue to enrich yourself as you have done.' 5* The Spanish merchant looked in the face of the wrecker for an instant and then answered, `Be it so! I will pay the price, though it is very dear, Señor Ingles.' The skipper made no reply, save by an impatient movement of his mustachoed lip. Davila slowly took from his pocket a large leathern purse, and laying it before him upon the table, untied it and poured forth the contents, which were Spanish ounces and half-ounces. He then slowly counted out one thousand dollars, and thrust it over towards the wrecker. `There, Señor Capitan, there is gold for thy goods.' `It is not enough!' `There is one hundred pesos more.' `It is not the sum I demand. Trifle not with me and make this delay. I must not dally here.' `Thou art a hard dealer, Señor,' answered Davila, thrusting him the remainder. `There is thy price.' `And thou hast the goods in store below. Adios, Señor,' and the wrecker rose to go. `Take wine with me, Señor. I always close a bargain with good wine, and this is a rare wine, which I ordered expressly for thee and me! a glass will refresh thee, and make thee cheerful; for, by our lady, you always look gloomy enough!' The wrecker frowned, but letting the curtain fall again before the alcove, he reseated himself at the table and extended his glass, which the merchant filled. Ingles was about to lift it to his lips, when the door opened and a young American midshipman and two sailors entered. The midshipman was Harry. One of the two men-of-war's men, who were drinking at the farther extremity of the pulperia, seated in a darkened box, looked out between their curtains, on hearing the door open, and immediately uttered a warning cry to his companion, and both together rushed from their table, leaped over the bar and darted through a door in the room. Harry was about to follow the deserters with his men, when the Spanish pulperero, who was in the bar, placed himself before the passage, with a long glittering knife, and said, as he brandished it, `No puede pasar aqui, Señor.' Harry drew his stiletto, but immediately replaced it in its sheath, and giving orders to his men to follow him round to the back of the shop, he darted out of the street door, without having discovered the two men, the merchant and the wrecker, seated in the box by the door. But the latter had caught sight of Harry's features, as he was leaving the pulperia, and on beholding them he started with such impetuosity that the wine-bottle was overset, while an exclamation of mingled hatred and surprise escaped his lips. Without saying a word in explanation to Davila, he instantly left the box and advanced quickly to follow the youth, the recognition of whom had produced such an extraordinary effect upon him. But ere he opened the door, he stopped short and turned back and approached the bar, where stood the swarthy pulperero, replacing his knife in his girdle. `Pepe, do you know what ship those two seamen deserted from, that this officer was after?' he demanded, in a tone that made the merchant survey him with surprise, and Pepe to stare a moment before he replied, `The Augusta, Señor.' `An American?' `Si, Señor.' `She lays at anchor, near the Moro?' `Si, Señor Capitan. She dropped down there yesterday, and is ready for sea, the two marineros say. They give me, you know, two doubaloons a piece to conceal them till she is clear of the harbor.' `Do you know her destination?' `I believe, a cruise to windward.' The wrecker made no further inquiry; but after reflecting a moment, he was abruptly leaving the pulperia, when Davila cried, `Ah, bless us, Señor Ingles, you go without your gold, which you have left here on the table, tied up in a handkerchief. You see I am an honest man.' `Very honest, Señor,' responded Ingles, ironically; and taking up the money he placed it in his breast-pocket and quitted the house. Before advancing along the street, he looked on either hand as if in search of the young midshipman; but not seeing him, he said, `Well, let him go, now! If that sloop does not sail to-night, he is mine, and my revenge upon those I have hated, as other men love, shall then be complete. Had I known all I have lately learned and now know, I should never have let him gone as I did. But I will make amends for this folly, by getting him once more into my power. He is attached to this sloop, then. It is many years since I last saw him, when I left him in Boston, but I cannot be mistaken. The youth has the same face that the child had. I knew, too, from my faithful spy, that he was in some ship in the American service. Now, how to get him into my possession? for, without him, all I have done hitherto is but half done, and done in vain. Were it night, and he without the men with him, I would seize him at any risk, before he reached his ship.' He walked slowly on, planning some scheme for possessing himself of the person of the youth, whom he had so singularly met. He knew that he would soon return on board the sloop-of-war; and after some deliberation, he resolved to go on board his shallop, and send Vique, whose person was less known than his own, to ascertain in the town when the sloop was likely to get under weigh. Having decided on this first step, he hurried on board his craft, desirous to escape possible recognition by his victim; for, if recognized by him, he feared that an excitement might be raised, and that his vessel would be detained. He, therefore, resolved to keep out of the way, leaving Vique to act. In an hour the young emissary returned from the coffee-house, and reported that it was thought the sloop would not get sail until late the next day. `Then have I time to arrange my plans,' he said, with energy. `Vique.' `Señor.' `I have a service for you. Do it faithfully, and you shall have one hundred pesos. `Bueno!' answered the handsome but villainous looking young Spaniard, his black eyes shining at the proffer. `I have a desire to get into my possession a young midshipman, who belongs to the Augusta sloop-of-war. Towards evening, I shall drop down and anchor nigh her, so and in such a position that the current of the ebb tide will set from her towards me. In the mean while, you must, in some way, manage, ere night, to get on board the sloop in one of her boats. Once there, you must try and get to speak to this midshipman aside. Tell him, privately, that if he would hear news from one he has been long separated from, he must manage secretly to let himself down into a boat, which he will find under the lee counter, which will take him on board the shallop he sees near, where he will hear news from his sister.' `This will hardly induce him to risk so much, Señor.' `Do not fear. Repeat to him the words I have taught you, and I will answer for him, that you will find it hard to keep him within the bounds of due caution. Tell him this intelligence will be given only on the pledge that he withholds his intention from all on board. Assure him that the least attempt to betray you, to make you tell your secret there, will defeat forever his wishes! Now go, and be prompt and discreet.' `The name of this midshipman, Señor?' `I know not what name he goes by, now. Doubtless he is called Henry or Harry; but of this I will not be sure. He is about seventeen years of age, with chestnut hair glossy and curling, brown eyes, large and expressive, and rather handsome. It is the same one who was on shore this morning in pursuit of two deserters. This fact will be a sufficient guide to you. Now, take the boat and depart.' It was an hour past noon, and three hours after Vique left the shallop on this expedition, that a boat's crew came to the quay in the first cutter of a man-of-war. Rogers was in command of her, but Harry was also in the stern sheets. The crew landed and proceeded to load the forward part of the barge with provisions and parcels, that were lying upon the quay ready. Among the crew was a young, good-looking Spanish sailor, neatly clad, who was cheerfully volunteering his assistance to the men in getting the heavier parcels on board. He spoke broken English very amusingly, laughed, cracked jokes, and, altogether, made himself and the old tars very merry at their work. `I say, my lad, how should you like to ship,' asked Rogers; `we have lost three men to-day, and I think you will do.' `I will ship for good wages, Señor,' answered Vique, who was quite a different looking person, in his neat blue jacket, shining tarpaulin, and white duck trowsers, from what he was in his broad palm hat, red striped shirt, and green plaid gingham pants, shortened half up to his knee and trimmed with a fringe! `You shall have twelve pesos.' `Bueno! I will ship, then.' `Where is your chest?' `It is at a café, in Calle San Pedro.' `Well, the boat will be ashore again before sundown. Go and get your chest here, and we will then carry you on board. He will make a good hand, Harry.' `Yes,' answered Carneil, `I am glad to get one to make up for the two that escaped from me. But once let the men get inside of these pulperias, they are safe.' The boat put off to the ship, leaving Vique standing upon the quay. His eye followed the figure of Harry till it was lost to it. He then turned away, satisfied that he had discovered in him the person Ingles alluded to; for he had not only heard him repeatedly named by Rogers, in speaking to him, but he perfectly answered the description; and Vique also heard him confess he had lost two men he was in pursuit of. As there was yet some hours to sunset, he returned to the shallop, and reported his success thus far. He remained on board until the anchor was weighed, and she was under weigh to drop down towards the sloop, when he left her by springing on board a vessel that lay at the dock, as the skipper steered close to her, and brushed by her for the purpose. We have already seen the shallop take up her position near the Augusta. Vique hastened to the quay, but too late. He found the cutter had just gone. He knew it would be the last boat that day from her. While he was hesitating what to do, a boat came to the landing, the seamen of which he knew to belong to the American service. He inquired of the coxswain, who told him she was the first cutter of a clipper-schooner. On learning that the schooner lay near the sloop, he told him his story and the coxswain bade him get into the boat, if the officer they came for was willing. This officer, a passed midshipman, and acting lieutenant on board the clipper, at this moment made his appearance, and permitted him to go in the boat. But on reaching the schooner, the officer told Vique to come on board, that he was more needed there than in the sloop, and that Rogers must find another man. Vique silently submitted; but resolved to swim to the sloop in the night. Suspecting this, the officer ordered him below, for he had noticed his reluctance at the first to get on board. He was therefore in the schooner, when she got under weigh with Forrestal and Harry. Ingles, finding from Harry's cry and act that he had been recognized, and dreading the consequences, had instantly got under weigh, ignorant of Vique's situation, but leaving all, to effect his own escape.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">6 CHAPTER V. The Island Cavern. We now change the scene of our story to that region of islands and keys, known as the Bahamas. Towards the northern extremity of this western archipelago are congregated several large islands, connected by keys or chains of rocky islets, or mere sand-hills, with here and there a single palm or cocoa tree, growing upon its sterile surface. The largest of this group of superior islands is well known to navigators as Abaco; but its more familiar appellation is `The-Hole-in-the-Wall,' suggested by the singular aspect one of its low promontories presents to the eye of the passing voyager, being perforated with an arch, through which the sea and vessels sailing past in the distance are visible. The `key-stone' of this natural arch has fallen into the deep water underneath, and now only a wide opening or cleft meets the view. It is upon this island we are about to lay the scenes of this chapter. The time is three days after the departure of the shallop and the clipper-schooner from the harbor of Havana. The sun has not yet gone down, but lingers in the glowing west, turning the waves of the farspread ocean into burnished gold. The large, desolate, and almost treeless island, Abaco, lays outstretched upon the shining sea, like some huge leviathan, throwing out from its southern head and sides jagged reefs, like feelers, as if reaching forth to seize upon and make prey of the heedless ship, that approached too near. Upon the head of one of these wall-like projections, the sun reveals a single human figure. On a near view, it is apparent that it is a female. She is standing looking seaward along the ship-passage to the south and east. Her eye turns away, and rests upon a sail that lies close under the horizon, far away to the north. This sail and herself are the only signs of life in all that wide region of ocean and island. Nay, far to the south, at least nine miles, can be just discerned a lonely white tower. It is a light-beacon for the guidance of mariners through that perilous passage by night; but the sight of it only makes her own solitude more sensibly felt. The expanse of view around the island on which we find her is wide, and, lighted up by the gorgeous hues of the setting sun, is beautiful even in its desolation. Naked rocks, towering in solitary pinnacles, and savage chains of reefs have their edges gilded, and receive a rosy light from the sky; and barren islands, and the white, sandy keys that fill the prospect southward, are made to smile with sunshine; while the wide water is like a prism in the glory of its dyes. The skies above the island are also pure and soft, and here and there a fleecy cloud resembling a snowy plume, or one like a scarlet mantle flung out upon the western sky, gives new beauty and variety to the whole fair scene of heaven, earth, and ocean. There were within the horizon of this general view certain objects in detail, which the eye would only afterwards take in and particularly observe. One of these was a wreck of a large ship, that lay in the cleft of a black, ragged reef, that stretched south from the cliff, on which the female was standing. The wreck was without masts or bowsprit, and on the rocks were strewn fragments of spars and of pipes, bales, and boxes, broken open and rifled. Far away, a league north, on a lonely key, was visible another object on the strand, which the practised eye would detect to be another wreck. There lay also, near the foot of the rocky eminence on which she stood, the forward half of a lugger, that had been wedged in the rocks, and over which, in a storm, the sea must leap with a wild roar. Placid as every thing was around her in the glory of the evening sun, the features of the island immediately about where she stood were very wild. The shoulder or hump of the island swelled away abruptly west, gaining its highest elevation less than a mile distant. But a few stunted shrubs grew upon its bold, rocky surface, and the winds of the fierce tempests that sometimes prevailed in those seas, had a full sweep to howl around its summit. Beneath her position, sheer down a hundred feet, was an inlet, reached, from where she stood, by a dangerous, zigzag pass. On all sides of it, save a narrow outlet towards the sea to the southeast, it was shut in by cliffs, whose dark shadows cast a gloom over its sheltered bosom. The sides of the precipices were, in many places, excavated into cavernous passages, in which, when the winds and sea were high, the surges roared and reverberated with the noise of thunder. This was the view beneath on her left. On her right was another precipitous descent into a circular basin, nearly shut in by isolated fragments, between some of which a small vessel might pass wing and wing. The south boundary of this basin, which was about half a mile in width and depth, was the curious spur or wall, in which was the enormous fissure denominated `The-Hole-in-the-Wall.' It was on this long, gigantic, wall-like promontory, and but a few paces from the verge of this chasm, that the female was standing. The top of this natural sea-wall was about sixty feet broad; and its length, from the main body of the island to the fissure, was a third of a mile. The chasm was a hundred feet broad, and the remainder of the spur beyond it extended about a quarter of a mile farther into the sea, terminating in an abrupt cliff-head eighty feet above it. After the female had taken a long and close view of the southern horizon, her position commanding many leagues of the ship-passage across the banks southward, she moved forward along the top of the sea-wall, and stood on the very verge of the chasm. As she moved forward, a huge brown mastiff, of that savage but sagacious breed, produced from a union of the Newfoundland race with that of the Cuban blood-hound, rose from the rock on which he had been crouched near her, and walked slowly on after her. His stature was enormous; and his aspect of sullen ferocity, combined with his vast strength, inspired terror. His color was a blackish brown, with the ears jet black, and lapping like an elephant's; while the skin of his black muzzle, with the bright red of his lip visible turned outward, hung loosely about his jaws, and a tusk like a boar's protruding beneath on his left side, increased the savageness of his appearance. A 6 * thick wiry mane covered his neck, and hair as long dangled about his huge feet. His motions were slow, but it was evident, from the tiger-like action of his limbs, that he possessed great activity as well as immense physical power. He came within a few feet of the female, and then crouched again, laid his head upon his fore-paws, and fastened his red, fiery eyes upon her, like a wolf watching his prey. It was a dreadful look, and jealousy watched each motion she made; but the young girl—for she was both young, and, though sun-browned and coarsely clad, graceful and beautiful —did not seem to regard his looks or his presence; yet it was plain there could be no compact of friendship and amity between that malignant brute and the innocent maiden his glaring glances watched so determinately. She was not more than nineteen years of age. Her eyes were a soft blue, but sad and sorrowful in their expression, as if the sunshine of her eyes had too often been extinguished in tears of woe. Her hair was a dark brown hue, and, spite of the sun and air that had darkened her cheek, was long and flowing, and worn in wild profusion down her shoulders. Poor girl! she needed its covering; for her shoulder was naked, and the garment she had on was of the coarsest cloth, and much torn, leaving one leg bare nearly to the knee. Her feet were also bare, and one of them was lacerated with the sharp flint-points of some of the loose rocks, that were strewn around. Such small and symmetrical feet were scarcely ever seen, yet they were as dark as a gypsy's, from exposure. Her small hands, too, were as hazel-hued as those of a little Abanaquis Indian girl's. Her form was symmetry itself; and, but for the brown hair, the blue eyes, and the glimpse of her white shoulders through her rags, she might have been taken for an Indian maid. The blue eyes looked strangely out from her dark face, and gave a singular style of beauty to her countenance. Their expression was sad, as well as that of the beauteous mouth; and the stamp of misery and bondage was impressed upon her restrained look and air. In her hand this beautiful savage held a little sprig, which she had plucked from a stunted shrub, containing three scarlet leaves, which by some means had lost their green hue. These she carried for their beauty of color, for she had never seen a flower on that reef-girted island of rocks. She knew not that there were roses,—that the green earth was enamelled with fragrant flowers of a thousand dyes. If she found a stone or a shell with pleasing colors, it was as a flower to her. She now looked upon the three poor little red leaves, and said, `how beautiful!' and smiled as she looked upon them. She was happier with gazing upon them than many a maiden is upon her crowded conservatory or her gorgeous parterre of flowers, where the dahlia, the moss-rose, the rhododendron and tulip vie with each other to win her passing regards. She stood watching the blue sea heaving through the passage in the Wall, as the tide rose, and then again her eyes wandered towards the southern horizon. The expression with which she seemed to look for a vessel was not one of hope and anxious desire, but rather of fear; for as she saw that there was none visible where she sought for one, her face assumed a more cheerful and relieved look. Her gaze was directed seaward more in apprehension than in hope. `He will not be here to-night,' she said, after satisfying herself that there was nothing in sight southwardly. She spoke in a joyful tone and in a very melodious voice; but her speech was in the Spanish tongue. The sun had by this time sunk slowly below the horizon, and the twilight was gently gathering over the scene. She placed her hand up to shade her eyes, and took one more look, and then began to retrace her steps to the more elevated point a little way back, on which we first beheld her. As she turned, the mastiff-hound rose and followed her with dogged perseverance, but evidently not from attachment and affection; for he seemed capable of neither. She passed the point where she was first looking out, and, after continuing about fifty yards, she came to a fissure in the top of the cliff-wall, which extended half way across. It was of such depth, that it looked dark on gazing into it. She passed part way around it, when by steps, visible only by close observation, cut into the sides, she began to descend, with a familiar and fearless tread, into the very bowels of the rock. It was like one of the cavernous wells of the East, the bottom of which is accessible only by a flight of artificial steps. After she had descended for about thirty feet this narrow and irregular path, she came to a shelf of the rock which would contain a dozen men; and still lower down the fissure was cleft into the heart of the promontory. At the farther verge of this shelf, and in total darkness, was an arched way, through which gleamed faintly a light like that of a lamp. She passed under this inner arch, and, stooping low, traversed a sort of gallery for about twelve feet, each step bringing her into stronger light, when she emerged into a vast subterraneous chamber, in which burned the lamp, the rays of which had penetrated nearly to the perpendicular shaft of this natural mine; for the descent was like that into a mine, and the passage and cavern like the excavated gallery and chamber of a mine. There was a narrow fissure in the side of this interior room, through which the glowing sky in the west looked like a zigzag chain of gold; and through a small, irregular crevice opposite, not bigger than a hand, was a view of the sea to the north; but both of these apertures were so small that they afforded no light to the chamber. The lamp which illumined it was a frigate's battle-lantern, and stood upon a projection of the rocky wall, at a sufficient elevation to cast its beams over the place. The chamber was about forty feet long, fifteen in height at its highest part, and twenty five or six feet in breadth. A cavern, very similar, farther out in the cliff, had doubtless been undermined by the waves, and falling into the sea left the roof arching across, till by-and-by that plunged also, leaving a passage that a schooner could pass through. This cave into which the young girl descended was like some huge storehouse. It was filled with bales, kegs, boxes, and such articles of lesser bulk than hogsheads, as could be conveniently transported thither and secreted by mere bodily strength. They were the choice portions of the cargoes of more than one luckless vessel; for the names of two ships were plainly visible on the directions and labels of some of the parcels. Besides these articles, which were neatly piled up on one side of the cave, were rolls of canvass, sails, cordage, light spars, and other ship apparel. Furniture of all kinds was strewn around, and wares and utensils for cooking. Two hammocks were swung at one extremity, and a berth with gilded pannels and cornices just as it was taken from the ship, was put up in one corner; and near it were placed several bunks of ruder construction. All kinds of arms were piled in one corner, and near the entrance stood a brass four-pounder against the rock. The young girl crossed the uneven floor of this underground chamber, and ascended a sort of loft constructed partly of upright spars and partly by the aid of a broad shelf of the cave-side. The loft was eight or nine feet high above the floor of the cave, and was gained by a rope ladder, which had once served as the rattlings of a ship's mainmast. She went lightly up this ladder, and drew it up after her, and then, kneeling down, folded her hands and murmured some simple words of prayer, such as childhood lisps at a mother's knee. She then threw herself upon a mattress that lay close within the shelf that sustained the narrow platform which served her for a lodging-room, and in three minutes she was fast asleep. The dog had descended the sides of the shaft a few moments after her, and now entered the cave. He trotted along towards the loft, and laid down directly underneath it, after first satisfying himself that she was upon it. As he laid down he disturbed some one who was crouched there, and an oath, uttered in strong African gutterals, showed that the individual was a negro. `Get out ob dis, Jover, you' bed furder dat away!' The dog replied only by a growl, and stretching himself still more broadly upon the skin which served him as a couch. `O, well, keeps you' place, you willain. I see by de red sunset froo de chink dat it time for me get up and cook some supper for me and Dory; and pra'ps massa come too. Hab you seen him sail, Jover? You say notin', so you hab 'nt. Is you hab Dory up dar, safe, you put yourself down here for watch? You growl, dat am yes. What for she go sleep widout her supper? Lately, she dont eat notin'; I spec' she sorry massa no come back sooner.' Here the African chuckled with a sort of malicious glee, and then twisting himself over and over, rolled his body out from beneath the loft into the middle of the cave. He then placed himself upright with a spring, not upon his feet, for he had neither feet nor legs; but looked precisely like one of those Chinese pear-shaped figures of human beings, heavier at one end than the other, made to vibrate like a pendulum. This African was just such a looking monster, only he had arms, which served him by their great length instead of legs. In height he was not more than two feet and a half, and quite as broad as he was high. His head was enormously large, and the features possessed the most hideous flexibility of muscle, so that his countenance was capable of every possible diabolical expression; yet his face was not destitute of a certain look of humor and easy good-nature, which is a peculiar characteristic of the negro race; nevertheless, it was clear, that, aroused to anger, his passions would be quite as savage as the brute ferocity of Jover, between whom and himself there appeared to exist a sort of growling good understanding. The negro wore upon his huge head a turban formed of a gay bandana handkerchief, very much the worse for the wearing, and his trunk was covered with a sack or frock of red woollen flannel. After righting himself and looking at the oil in the lantern, by which he ascertained the time that elapsed while he slept, he placed a hand on the ground on either side of his body, and raising himself a little, threw himself forward full a yard; and then repeating the manœuvre, he in this manner crossed the cavern to a box, from which he took a short pipe, which he filled with tobacco and lighted by the lantern. He then went to another chest that stood near a ship's stove, and taking out a piece of junk-beef weighing several pounds, he went to the stove, tossed it into a large kettle filled with water, kindled a fire beneath it, and placing himself before it, watched the process of boiling, while he deliberately smoked his pipe. The cavern was soon filled with smoke, both from the stove and the pipe, but gradually found its way out through the chinks in the sides and by passing out and up through the shaft.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">7 CHAPTER VI. The Tower Rock. When the African monster had satisfied himself, by tearing off pieces with his long fingers, that the huge piece of salt beef in the kettle was sufficiently cooked for his palate, he stuck a short fish-knife, that he wore in his belt, deep into it, and drew it reeking forth. Holding it up on the end of this knife, the savage began to rend it with his teeth and devour it in enormous masses. The piece of meat was two thirds the size of his own head, and yet, in ten minutes, he had left nothing of it but the bone. At every few mouth-fulls he would stop and chuckle and growl, with his jaws crammed, and seem to regret that he could not devour the whole at once. Every now and then, as he ate, he would cast a look, between apprehension and defiance, at the dog, who had risen from his couch and padded his way towards him almost with the heavy tread of a lion. The dog, however, made no other demonstrations than to snarl and display his fangs at every fresh pull the negro took at the meat. `There, Jover, dar bone for you,' said the African, casting it on the ground before him. Jover paid no other attention than by a deep guttural note of resentment. The negro then went to the chest and threw him a piece of meat, which the dog caught ere it reached the floor, and paced off to a corner of the cave to eat his meal without interruption. The African then lighted his pipe and went out of the cavern by leaping forward, with his ape-like hands placed on each side of him upon the ground, and which he used with such skill as scarcely to miss the other limbs which nature had denied him. On getting into the shaft, he saw that the night had fairly set in, and that the stars sparkled brightly in that small space of the heavens visible from the depth at which he was from the top of the promontory. `Hark! de wind risin, and dat bring master home to-night,' said the negro, listening to the low murmur of the sea around the base of the cliff. `I hope dere be storm to-night, coz time we catch anodder big ship; coz de beef mos gone. Me go up and look at de wedder.' Thus saying, the negro began to draw his body up the broken sides of the perpendicular descent, by fastening his strong fingers into the crevices, and in this way, in about three minutes, reached the top; though the least slip of his grasp would have sent him back to the shelf from which he started, like a heavy stone, and perhaps rebounding from the shelf, which led into the cavern, he would have plunged down the fathomless darkness of the depths far below. But habit had rendered him insensible to the danger, as well as the young girl, whom we have seen descend the same perilous path, with a light and fearless step. On looking around him, the Ethiopian saw quite a different aspect of the sky and ocean, from that which the young female had beheld. The golden clouds, that hung about the sun, as he went down, were now of an inky blackness, and were rapidly rising from the southwest, and expanding over the sky, though over his head all was yet clear and sparkling. The sea was moaning, and restlessly throwing itself against the shores, and a wind was already agitating its dark bosom. Far to the east a single light, like a star on the horizon, told him a vessel was in that direction. It was the ship seen by the young girl in the northeastern bound, and now steering southwardly to take the great channel between the ranges of islands. To the south, a bright light, three leagues distant, gleamed across the water, flinging its beams cheerfully abroad, as a beacon to the trustful mariner, who, with full confidence in its guiding and warning ray, steers fearlessly onward in the darkest night his adventurous bark. The African, after looking all round the horizon, with a slow and observing gaze, settled his eyes upon this beacon with an air of surprise. `Ah, dere you show you lantern agen! Now, if massa Paul do n't put you out, if he here, den I know notin! You know massa Paul 'way, and so you light up widout him leave! coz I know he nebber tell you light up when storm comin'; coz den am my time! You see he no kill you when he know dis!' added the negro, clenching his hand and speaking the menace with a savage vindictiveness, that would have been ludicrous, had it not been so devilish. `Dar a cloud comin up flyin like a black gull, and dere a ship comin on de bank for pass de channel. Now dat light dere, how I catch him, and if catch ship, when massa Paul gone, I get good deal gold and red cloth, and beads and long knife, and beef, and hide it way, and nebber massa Paul know what Lobo do! Ah, dere dey put em out, and guess dey better. I guess dey see dat cloud comin now, and know dat time to put em out!' The light had, indeed, suddenly vanished, and the African, after waiting a few moments, to see if it would reappear, said, `Now I mus have my business done, afore dis storm come on; coz I see by de way de waves begin to chafe on de rocks, it blow a reglar white gale, and de sea moanin, coz it no like to be wake up! Dory! ho! Dory!' he shouted down the shaft, in a shrill voice, that sounded more like the shriek of a cormorin than human. `Come, hurry you up with your lantern, for there is a storm risin!' `O, shall I never, never escape from this fearful bondage,' said the young girl, rising hastily from her rude bed and descending to the floor of the cave. `I was dreaming of my happy, happy home, and it sometimes seems that what I think I remember of the past is all a dream, and that I have never been otherwise than I am! Yet I do feel within me the spirit of another, and O, what a different state, that once in childhood was mine, and this it is that sustains and elevates me above the degradation to which I am doomed!' `Dory, you lazy wretch, come up!' shouted the Ethiopian down the cave, in an angry tone. `Yes, Lobo, yes! I am lighting the dark lantern, she answered, taking a small lantern with slides to 7* conceal and protect the light — for there was no glass in it — and lighting it at the stove. `Oh, that I could find some way of escape from this monster, and from the no less horrible guardianship of this fierce dog, who, faithful to the trust his cruel master has imposed on him, has already left his food to follow me, to see that I escape not! Poor chance has one so desolate as I am to escape; with no boat to convey me; no place to fly to, where I should not be pursued! Even the passengers and crews of the vessels that were wrecked by him, lest they should have discovered this cavern, were hurried from the Island by him and his wreckers in their luggers to Nassau! and here I remained a prisoner closely watched by Jover, while, doubtless, no one thought this lofty rock was accessible, or contained a living being! for, save those who know the path up its sides, it seems a sheer wall down to the sea! Coming, Lobo, coming! I cannot long remain here! Each month, each hour, my slavery is becoming more intolerable,' she said, with a kindling eye and in a spirited tone. Taking the lantern, she took her way out of the cave, and in a few minutes stood upon the top of the cliff. `You are a long while coming; take care, or I'll give you blows with my stick!' said the monster, savagely, and brandishing a short cudgel, that had once been a belaying-pin of some hapless vessel. `Oh, ho, Jover! you had to be done you supper quick! Good for you, coz you no satisfy wid de bone. Spose I want brute dog lib of de same meat me eat? Me man! me eat beef! You no man! you no bus'ness eat what Lobo eat! Ah, I know you come, soon I call Dory bring de lantern; coz you know if you let Dory get way, you hab take it when massa Paul come, wors an you did when she teal boat and get off a mile afore you swim out and catch de boat in you teeth and tow um shore. If you no swim out and tow um shore, when she get way dat time, massa Paul hab cot you brack head orf, Jover, and you knows dat wery well! So you bes keep sharp eye on her; coz Lobo no foller bout and go widout debble leg where Dory go, when she take it in her head to run! Come, now, down the cliff to the water,' he said to the young girl, `for we must have our work done afore it too dark, and dis storm come on and catch us!' She obeyed him, by going to the verge of the cliff, on the western side, and opening her lantern to throw light upon the spot, stooped down, and, taking hold of a projection of the rock, began to descend the face of the cliff by a path that had been formed by a portion of the upper part splitting off perpendicularly and falling over into the sea. The zigzag course of the break, which extended from the top to the bottom, was generally about a foot broad, but in some parts not three inches, and very steep. Opposite this cliff was another of less height, and between the two was a basin, into which this perilous descent led. The basin was dark in shadow, and the gloomy dash of the unseen surges echoing among the cavernous sides of the base came fearfully to the ear. Having found the first step of her path the young girl closed her lantern and hung it by a hook in her girdle, which was a seaman's rude leathern belt, and went down with a step so free that it was truly appalling to witness; for it seemed that the least error in placing her foot would precipitate her into the gulf below. But she had been too familiar with the path as well as with that down the shaft, to hesitate. The whole descent was about ninety feet by the path, the cliff being about seventy. After she had got about twelve feet down, the dog followed, creeping cautiously close to the wall of the rock, but stepping surely. Then the African committed himself to the path by his hands, by swinging his body over the verge and hanging on the edge of the descending path; and in this way, by passing one hand over the other, he followed them with astonishing celerity. At the foot of this dangerous passage was a large fragment of the rock which had fallen from above, ten feet broad and four or five out of the water, which all around it was of great depth; for it stood full a hundred yards from the main shore of the island. Upon this rock the young girl stepped, and opening her lantern looked on the inner side of it, where lay a small boat completely hidden by an overhanging part of the cliff-side. The dog and Lobo landed by her side, and the latter taking hold of a chain that secured the boat to a bolt in the rock, drew it towards them. He then took a key from a long pouch which he wore tied round his neck, and which held a little of every thing, and unlocked a massive padlock that secured the chain to the rock. He then threw himself into the boat, which was a small old skiff, and taking up two oars that lay in the bottom, placed them in the row-locks. The young girl got in and stood up in the stern, for there was no seat, and the dog leaped in and crouched silently in the bows. The African then bent to his oars, rowing without a thwart to set upon, for he needed none, being just the height of a person seated, by reason of his strange deformity. The little boat shot rapidly out of the basin, the surface of which already swelled with a heavy moaning noise, which in that region often betokens a gale. The scene around them, with the tall black cliffs on either hand, the high `back' of the island astern and near, before them the murky expanse of ocean, broken here and there in the foreground by the faint outline of a large rock, or the stronger defined range of a reef; while overhead swept past broken masses of bluish clouds, which had been detached by the upper currents of wind from the vast columns that were marching from the west across the field of the zenith. The boat kept along under the cliff, which, as we have said, extended nearly half a mile seaward, and as they glided along past that portion of it within which the cave was excavated, the momentary glimmer through a crevice of the light of the battle-lantern within the cavern was detected by the African, who had his eyes, as he pulled, elevated to a sufficient height to catch it. It was, however, but an instant glimpse he obtained of it, and to the eye of a stranger it would have been taken for an electric gleam flitting across his own vision, rather than for a light shining out of what seemed a solid wall of rock. The boat kept along the cliff until it came to the opening so well known as `The-Hole-in-the-Wall,' and which we have already described as an arched fissure shaped by the sea working into the cliff till it forced a deep passage through it, capable of admitting small vessels. Here it changed its course and shot through the passage, the overhanging fragments of the broken arch seventy feet above their heads threatening to come thundering down upon them each instant. Lobo pulled with a strong stroke through the fearful passage, for `the tide-current' had begun to set through it with considerable force against him. Having got through and on the northern and eastern face of the cliff he pulled seaward again parallel with it; rowing fast, for the storm was coming up with great rapidity, and he was fearful he should be unable to get back to his cavern and his beef before it would burst upon them. As he got farther out from the island, though still with the cliff close at hand on his left, there was visible a dark line extending quite across the field of view as seen from the low position in which they were. This was a reef; one of those long lines or chains of rocks, off against the promontory already described, and which, commencing near the cliff, at a quarter of a mile distant, stretched away for a league in a southerly direction, and towards the ship channel. At high water the reef was covered for the outermost two miles of it, the other shoreward mile showing only here and there above water a sharp point. At low tide, the whole reef was visible from one extremity to the other. Ships steering southwardly after making Abaco usually passed, at the time we write of, within a mile or two of the end of this reef; though now since new surveys have been made, and other and better channels discovered, their course, after making Abaco and across the banks, is altered. South of Abaco nine or ten miles, a beacon had been placed by the British, for the express object of defining this reef, so that a ship could lay her course safely by night and it was understood by mariners that vessels making Abaco at dark and bringing this light to bear W. S. W. half W. could run safely through the intricacies of the channel entrance and so render it unnecessary to come to anchor, as many vessels formerly did when the nights were dark; for there was a current that always set steadily towards the reef. The portions of this reef which lay near the cliff were composed of high insulated rocks, some of them fifty feet in altitude, rearing themselves like a ruined tower from the sea. To one of these large tower-like rocks, the negro directed his boat, leaving the cliff directly behind him, and pulling with great strength until the boat struck its side. It was not more than a quarter of a mile from the head of the cliff they had left, and stood, so to speak, on the extreme right of the league-long reef that extended its rocky line far away to the verge of the channel. The description is made thus particular that the subsequent details of the scenes enacted here may be clearly comprehended. Having made a landing upon this rock, the African began to ascend it with wonderful celerity, followed by the girl, the mastiff remaining in the bows of the boat, for he seemed to understand that his vigilance was on such a spot quite as effective if he remained in the boat; besides, the face of the rock was not furnished by nature with such means of ascent and descent as were the cliff and shaft; and it is doubtful if he had reached the top if he had made the trial. On getting near the summit of this columnar rock, Lobo reached, on the seaward side, a small cavity with the top of the rock overhanging it, not unlike the top of a chaise. It was an irregular, but perfectly sheltered opening, looking towards the east; and six men could have found shelter in it from a storm driving from the west. The floor of this shelter had been smoothed evidently by labor, and some projections, that extended too far over it from the top had been broken off. In the shape of this cavity there was nothing remarkable, as a hundred other similar excavations yawned in the cliffs and hollowed the rocks of that region. The use to which it had been and was now to be put, was the most wonderful. Lobo, on gaining this spot, removed a canvass covering which had once lain over a vessel's hatchway, and exposed in the back of the cavity a large iron hoop, suspended against the rear of this hollow place in the side of the top of the tower-rock. Upon the hoop were hung on wire hooks thirty-six small glass lamps, filled with the purest oil, and all neatly trimmed. This hoop of lamps was the size of the largest hogshead hoop. Behind it, made visible by the light of the lantern which the young girl opened, was a reflector composed of more than a thousand fragments of mirror irregularly put together, but covering a surface of the diameter of the hoop of lamps. In a word, it was a simple but most efficiently constructed light-house beacon! In a box underneath it were scissors, wicks, and a bottle of turpentine, to make them ignite easily, and with which Lobo began to touch each wick by means of a feather; and in the crevice of the rock were large demijohns of oil. `We must be speedy and return, Dory,' said Lobo, as he touched the last wick; `now light up and let us go, for the sea is growing dark, and we shall be caught in the storm.' The young girl with a sigh, and covering her face with her hand as if doing that, which made her tremble, but which fear compelled her to do, touched the light to the circle of lamps, and as they were all connected by a thread dipped in turpentine passing from one to the other, the whole circlet was instantly in a blaze, and a light dazzling as the sun caused them to turn away their faces and descend; while far over the sea eastward this false `Light of the Reef' sent its infernal glare, to lure the trustful and confiding mariner to shipwreck and death.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">8 CHAPTER VII. The Wrecker's Lugger. Leaving the two inhabitants of the cavern hurrying towards it in their little boat, after the light had been kindled upon the summit of the Tower-Rock, we shall now change the scene to the deck of the shallop, two hours later. By this time the tempest had burst upon the sea and islands in its strength, whitening the wild surface of the waters as if snow were drifting over them. The shallop was about twelve miles to the south of the island and laying to, for the wind was too high and the waves too terrific to run. The seas made a breach over her as she lay, but being light she rode them with buoyancy, though each moment threatened to be engulfed. At the helm stood Ingles. It was lashed, but nevertheless he stood by it from habit, his grasp upon the head of the carved tiller. It was a fearful sight. The howl of the wind through the skies, and its terrific roar, as it lifted the black waters and bore them upon its wings, would have appalled one less accustomed to such scenes. The wrecker stood grasping the helm with one hand and holding to the bulwarks of his little vessel with the other, and with a stern composure waited the passage of the hurricane. His men were forward clinging to the stays of the fore-mast, on which was spread the close-reefed fore-sail, which kept them to the wind. The only light thrown upon this fearful scene was from the phosphorescent glare of the foaming waves that heaved and tumbled and broke in shining masses around them. Darkness was upon the face of the deep, and the elements seemed rushing back into original chaos. The eye of the wrecker was often directed from the care of his vessel to windward, as if looking earnestly for some object. Then an expression of defiance would pass across his features, which shone white and ghostlike as they caught the baleful glare from the phosphorescent sea; he would murmur some words indistinctly, and then give his attention in-board to his vessel, the momentary expression passing away and changing to one of seaman-like anxiety for the shallop's safety. `See to the fore-sheet, that it is well belayed!' he suddenly cried, in a voice above the tempest. `The sail labors hard, and if any thing gives way we do n't see `The-Hole-in-the-Wall' again, any of us! The storm has n't yet got all her pipes in her teeth!' `All safe, sir,' answered one of the men in Spanish, for the wrecker had used this tongue, though with a slight accent, that indicated it was not native to him. `Do you know where we are now, Capitan?' `About three and a half or four leagues from the Island. But since this storm came up I cannot tell where we are, exactly. We must lay to till it blows over us. The boat rides well, and has need to; for this is a gale that a larger and better craft might go down under.' `Where do you think the schooner is by this time?' `At the bottom of the channel, I hope!' answered the wrecker, with emphasis. `They can't be so well acquainted with these waters as I am, and yet we have been nearly lost to-night till we hove her to. Rocks and reefs around her, and not twenty feet under her keel, she stands a fair chance of faring as I hope she may!' `It was a hard chase we have had, sir,' said the Spaniard, who had taken Vique's office in the craft; `and if it had not been for this gale we might have had warm work of it. When it came on she was within three miles of us.' And the man, as he finished speaking, came aft, pulling himself along the decks by the aid of the bulwarks; for the deck was as steep as a roof, and each moment a cataract from a broken wave poured over her from taffrail to bowsprit. `There is no doubt we should have been overhauled, Publo, but before they should have come alongside they should have sunk the shallop with their shot!' The words of the wrecker, as he spoke, were not more expressive of determination than his countenance. `Do you think they have any idea who we are, Capitan?' `They know very well. They have one on board them, or else are sent by one who knows that I am in the shallop. But let him heed himself. If I ride out this storm safely, there may yet be power in my hands for evil, as there has been.' `What do you mean, Capitan?' asked the Spaniard, wonderingly. `It matters not what I mean! attend to the shallop. Look out up the rigging for the light! With this tide and wind we must be drifting fast.' The man threw himself into the rigging, and, clinging to it with his hands and feet, had ascended but a little way before a wave caught him upon its crest, and wresting him from his grasp bore him, shrieking with despair, high over the vessel's deck, and whelming him far to leeward in the wild vortex of the mad seas. The wrecker gave utterance to a fearful curse, as he saw the man borne away beyond hope of rescue. The next wave tore the fore-sail from its booms and hoops, and swept the deck, pouring over the vessel in a deep cascade, a roaring waterfall of many feet, and for a moment only the masts and the head of the skipper and one of his men was above the surface. The shallop, however, after a desperate struggle, threw off the vast weight of water, and rose buoyant above the surge, only to encounter another equally gigantic. `She can't stand this, crank as she is,' said Ingles, seriously, as he shook the salt spray from his face and gray locks. `I have but a single man left; for this last sea has taken that lubberly Pedro!' `What shall we do, Capitan?' cried the sole remaining man, creeping aft and clinging with fear to the tiller.' `Die, if we must!' he answered, with savage gloom. `But thou mayst follow after thy companions, and perish; but I shall not die! O, no! I have too much unfinished work yet in the world. It is not to be my fate to die now! By and by, but not now!' `We are sure to be lost, Capitan!' `No, Juan, no! I fear not. If thou wouldst live, cling closely, and bind thy body to the main-mast.' `No, no! if the shallop should founder!' `Then take what care you can of yourself.' `Where are we now?' 8 `Ask the wind or the waves! I know not. Dost thou not know that the waves have long since put out the binnacle light, and my compass is no better than a piece of white paper? I know not south from north, save that I guess it from the course of the wind. But I am content,' he added, with an exulting laugh; `I am content, Juan, so that the infernal schooner has the same!' `And do you think she fares as bad as we have?' `She will be at the bottom before dawn to-morrow, if this gale blows on in this way.' `And so shall we, Jesu Maria!' `No; keep thy tears and prayers! I tell thee I shall not die!' `Then I will cling to thee, Capitan;' cried the man, terrified by the fate of his shipmates, and the roar of the tempest, which seemed each instant to increase in fury; and, as if catching a sort of hope from the reckless words of the wrecker, he embraced his knee, and clung to him with the energy of a man who would strive to resist fate. `Ah, poor Juan, you will die, too, in spite of your fears and clinging grasp,' he said, smiling at the man's terror. `We are now driving, God knows where! before the tornado; for now our fore-sail is blown out of its hoops we have nothing to steady her by, and must let her drive! When the gale first struck us we were then running in the windward gap, to creep to windward of the schooner, for I knew she would hardly risk following us in, without a pilot, which she can't have on board, I think. We were about five leagues from Abaco then, and running N. N. E. We ran about a league in the gale before we lay to, and we have been laying to more than an hour and a half.' `And all this time we have been drifting!' `Yes; both with wind and tide. It is my opinion we are not many miles off from the Island!' `O, Señor, that we were there! There is a high wave rolling along astern after us! It will destroy us!' `Hist thy noise, hombre! 'T is worse than the wail of the storm. Do you not see how the shallop rises upon it, as it stoops under the stern and lifts her up as you would lift an infant, and tosses her onward!' `We shall soon drive on the rocks, and then there will be no escape!' `I can do nothing! The hurricane holds us in its fist, and we must await our destiny. Didst thou feel, Juan, the joy I feel, to know that the schooner is in peril as well as we, and that perchance there is one on board of her who will perish with her, if she perish, as surely she will this night, unless that boy carries a charmed life, as I think he must, for many is the death,' added Ingles, muttering to himself, `that I have laid in his path, and yet he lives.' `Who is it, Capitan, you speak of?' `Get to thy feet, man, and look this way with me!' cried the wrecker, suddenly. `What is it thou seest? Is it not a vessel, almost within call?' `It is a spectre ship, Señor! The Holy Mother save us now, for our death is sure.' `Fool! 't is the glare of the sea that throws this strange light upon her! It is a vessel, and it is the schooner! But she is to leeward. It must be another vessel!' `I see her, but I cannot see how many masts she has. The schooner should be to windward.' `My eyes are not blind! Dark as it is, I see plainly she is a schooner. She may have carried sail longer than we did and so over-run us. She is now laying to, and as dead ahead as she can lie, and not a cable's length off!' `We shall go into her, Capitan!' `No! your knife, quick, to cut the lashings of the tiller, for I can steer her clear, if the devil help me!' A schooner was now seen but a little distance ahead, lying to under a close-reefed fore-sail and jib. Although the skies and sea around the low horizon were pitchy black, yet the outlines of near objects were visible by the light of the breaking waves, as we have before observed; a light peculiar to the sea in low latitudes, of a most extraordinary nature, and of which no description will convey any adequate idea. It must be seen. Instead of light it is the ghost of it! It was by its unearthly glare that the schooner was apparent to their vision. The shallop, driven before the wind, upon the top of the waves, without an inch of canvass, was bearing down directly upon the schooner's beam. The wrecker had cut the lashings of the hitherto neglected helm, and taken it in his grasp. With an eye fixed upon the schooner, he coolly undertook to save his vessel from instant destruction. If he could have sunk the schooner at the same time with his own craft, he would doubtless have let her run aboard, head on, as she was driving; but the weight of the shallop was not sufficient to insure certain destruction, and less than that he was not the man likely to attempt. The shallop was now seen on board the schooner, and instantly the voices of alarm and warning reached the wrecker's ears, as he stood in the stern of his little vessel, guiding her with all his skill and strength, aided in the latter by Juan. He smiled, as he heard the confusion. `Now starboard a little, Juan.' `Starboard, señor!' `Steady, Juan!' `Steady!' `Starboard hard!' he shouted, in a voice that rung on the winds; and they threw themselves bodily upon the tiller to press it hard up to the windward. `Starboard for your life!' called out Forrestal, from the deck of the schooner through his trumpet, and echoing his cry were heard a score of voices throughout the vessel. The next moment the shallop shot by upon a huge wave directly under the bows of the schooner, the bowsprit of the latter catching each of her masts, one after the other, and sweeping them from her deck as she flew by, scarce checking her in her fearful speed. At the same moment, Ingles, swept off by the masts, found himself in the sea, clinging to the davit of his vessel with one hand, his other arm hanging broken at his side. With a vast effort, he raised himself to his deck, the dismasted vessel still driving on like an arrow upon the waves and winds. On looking around he found himself alone. Poor Juan had perished. He smiled with a feeling of stern, almost savage exultation, as he realized that he was the only one who had survived the tempest and the wreck; and he felt as if he could believe in the truth of his own recklessly uttered words, that, as yet, his destiny on earth was not sealed! Behind him was the schooner, fading spectre-like, in the mists of the night, and on the storm was borne to his ears loud words in fierce denunciations, that he answered with a loud laugh, that mingled strangely with the shrieking of the gale. The shallop had hove in sight, borne down upon, and plunged under the schooner's bows all so in a moment, that Forrestal saw her flying dismasted to leeward, with her commander standing alone upon her deck, before he could realize the whole that passed. He had run forward, after echoing the wrecker's own order to put his helm hard up, but only to see him dash by, leaving ruin behind; for the bowsprit, which had swept the lugger's mast by the board, broke off short at the foot, and fell into the sea amid the ruin it had caused. The schooner lost her power with the loss of the jib, to lay to so well, and began instantly to roll and pitch as if she would pitch her long slender masts out of her, for they bent with the elasticity of steel rods at every plunge of her bows under. Forrestal stood a moment upon the windlass, supporting himself by his hand on the bitt, looking after the shallop, which was not in sight to his eyes a minute and a half after she had gone past. Suddenly, he felt a hand upon his arm. `Well, Harry!' `It was the shallop! I saw him! for I had hold of the foot of the jib when she went by. I saw him! You will not let him escape!' were the earnest words of Carneil, amid the confused and angry cries of the men. `Yes, it was some wreckers, Harry; but it may not have been the chase. It was too dark to distinguish any one.' `No, no! not to distinguish him! Besides, I heard his voice! Listen! I hear it now!' `It is the laugh of a demon! I will have him, Harry, if it be our man, as I suspected when I saw him coming down, though I expected he would have been ahead.' `Shall I give the order to make sail?' `Yes, Harry, for we cant well lay to without our jib. Let her drive! He has no canvass, and we will not be long behind him. I know pretty well where we are, and that the channel is free ahead. All hands to unloose the main-sail and set her close-reefed, and ease off the fore brace. We must let the schooner take it wing and wing and drive!' The orders were obeyed with alacrity; for the shallop had for the last two days given the schooner a great deal of trouble, by dodging and running among keys, and taking advantage of other means of escaping, rendered efficient by the perfect knowledge Ingles had of the Bahama Banks, over which the chase had been followed. The crew were, therefore, glad of any chance of getting him into their power. The schooner now went bowling along over the huge white-capped waves with appalling velocity; and as she was hurled onward from sea to sea, she rolled in every shell of the billows, so that her top-sail yard dipped at every swing of her masts to this side and that, and the sea was almost constantly waist deep in-board. `If she goes bodily under at every swoop, Harry, I promise you I will stand on so long as a spar holds, or she can swim!' `Thank you, Mr. Forrestal,' answered Harry, who stood by his side on the quarter-deck, both keeping their feet by holding to the binnacle, — for no man could stand upon deck unsustained. The bows were under water constantly, and the men had all been called aft as far as the capstan, for the forecastle was swimming. `Thanks, for your kindness, good Forrestal,' continued Harry, insensible of the great danger around him, in his anxiety to capture the shallop; and Forrestal, for love of him, and almost as deeply interested as himself in getting the man into his power, looking upon the storm only in the light of a more welcome means of putting the wrecker into his hands. `He cant be far ahead now, Harry! We must go twice as fast as he does, scudding with our sails, and he without a spar. The only fear I have is, that he may go to the bottom!' `Oh, no, I hope not! If he is lost to-night, all is lost! Heaven preserve him!' `Amen! this is praying in earnest for our enemies, Harry! Keep him from drowning, that he may be hanged, is my prayer! Keep a sharp look there about the gangways. We can see ahead without being on the bows, now we have no bowsprit, Harry. See! it is breaking in this direction! It is to the northwest. It blows yet as hard as ever, but we shall have an end of this before midnight. What do you see?' `I thought I saw the shallop, but it was only a black wave lifting itself ahead.' `The billows are growing longer and higher, and that is a sign we are shoaling our water. Heave the lead!' he shouted. `You need not go forward with it into the fore-chains, or you will be washed overboard! besides, you cant stand it. Heave at the gangway, with plenty of slack!' `Seven fathom!' answered the man, in a quick tone of surprise and alarm. `Sound again!' `Six fathom!' At this moment, a ground-swell billow, twenty feet in height, and of inky blackness, with an edge of bluish light, came majestically swelling after them. Seeing its approach, Forrestal called out, `Harry, hold on to me! Every man throw himself flat upon the deck!' The mountainous wave, with a velocity that outstripped that of the winged vessel, hung an instant above the stern, like a beetling cliff, and then tumbled with a sliding motion in upon the quarter-deck, and rolled roaring towards the bows. A second and then a third followed it, and the vessel, for full a minute, lay dead under the burden; but rolling, she emptied her decks of most of it and recovered herself from the shock, and went driving onward again, as before. Forrestal sprung to his feet, and Harry with him, to behold a scene of ruin. The binnacle, with their only compass, and the man at the wheel, had been swept overboard, and a dozen of his crew, out of fifty men, were 9 struggling in the surges far astern. The companion-way, the caboose, and every thing not a part of the firm hull, had been swept over, and three of the guns had broke from their lashings and were driving from one side of the deck to the other, at every roll of the vessel. Forrestal had hardly time to contemplate the wreck, or lament the poor fellows lost, ere Harry, who had but one thought and one object for his eyes, cried out, in thrilling tones, `The lugger! the lugger, Forrestal!' `Where?' he cried with animation, forgetting all else. `Dead ahead!' `I see, and I will ride right over her and sink her!' `No! He must be saved!' cried Harry. `True! Then I will lay along and leap on board! How is the lead?' he asked, anxiously, `for we may be ashore in three minutes!' `Eight and a half!' `We are safe awhile, then!' he answered with energy. `I will take the helm now myself, for your man shall be ours, Harry!'</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER VIII. The Fate of the Shallop. The wrecker, from his deck, saw the schooner reappear from the darkness astern, in about a quarter of an hour after he had passed her with such damage to his little vessel; and with one arm clinging around the stump of his main-mast, and the other thrust into his bosom, he stood with his face towards her, sternly watching her approach. `They come upon me fast! They will soon be aboard of the shallop, and it will be a grave in the deep sea, or chains,' he said within himself. `I will not die yet. What proof have they, that I am the wrecker that kindles the false beacon on the reefs? No man knows it, that dare betray me! So, I fear them not. But what these now seek me for, is not a matter of beacons and shipwrecks. That boy's tale has despatched the schooner, for I clearly saw him with my glass on her decks yesterday, when she came so near as to fire a shot over me. Then I should have been taken, but for an opening in the keys into which I run, and so got through to the channel beyond, while they had two leagues round to go. Ah, I have led them a brave chase, the three days since I sailed from my anchorage under the Moro. And well it was I did sail, for I should have been prevented, I see, from the prompt manner this schooner has been sent against me. Bravely they come on, and in five minutes they will be up with me! They mean to run over me!' he suddenly exclaimed, with a quick alarm, that showed the instinctive love of life was true to itself. `No! they are putting the helm up! I will suffer them to take me, for I shall deny all knowledge of the boy. His word can be no proof for my detention, after she gets back to port; and no man of them can identify me as the displayer of the beacon. They are upon me! I must yield or sink! Ho! the schooner!' he shouted, in a tone loud and imperious,—do you mean to go over me?' `No, but I mean to sink your shallop,' answered Forrestal, who had changed his original intention, knowing the man would save himself. `As the bows of the schooner touch you — for I can't pass you, having no command of my vessel in such a sea — cling to the anchor-fluke and throw yourself on board!' There was no time to deliberate. The schooner was right upon him. The masts and sails towered above his head, and the next wave would hurl her over his little vessel, whose deck was now nearly level with the surface of the sea `Now is your time,' shouted Forrestal, in a tone heard above the noise of the waves; and the same instant the sharp bows of the schooner struck the larboard quarter of the lugger about a fathom forward of her taffrail, and pressed her, or rather crushed her with the blow and weight instantly out of sight! The wrecker, with an oath at the loss of his vessel, and at being compelled to throw himself into the hands of his foes, caught at the fluke of the anchor, and saved 9* himself from being swallowed up in the wild vortex which had engulfed the shallop. He then threw himself over the bulwarks of the schooner, and, half swimming, half wading through the seas that broke over the bows on their striking the shallop, he made his way aft, and confronted Forrestal, who had hung a battle-lantern on one of the belaying-pins under the main shrouds. The light of the lantern fell full upon the wrecker. He was bare-headed, and his grey thick hair was dripping with brine. His brawny neck and chest were naked, and he was clad only in a Spanish shirt and pantaloons. His large stature and muscular frame were in strong relief, and the haughty defying expression of his strongly marked features was imposing. With his bared arms folded across his herculean breast, he stood, as if disdaining any support, during the irregular rolling of the vessel, surveying Forrestal, and Forrestal surveying him, for full half a minute in silence. Close by Forrestal's side stood the light, elegant figure of Harry Carneil, his eyes also closely reading the features of the wrecker. `So, then, is this your welcome,' said Ingles, with a sneer, and a disdainful movement of his head; `am I a wild beast, that you and your men stand and gaze on me thus. God help you! I hope you will know me again, and especially that younker with the button! You have run down my vessel, and I expect you to give me hospitality on your own!' `You shall have it, to your heart's content,' answered Forrestal with a cool smile. Harry had started, and all the blood in his heart leaped to his brain, when the wrecker alluded to him. For an instant he could not speak. He was about to reply in an indignant tone and boldly denounce him, when Forrestal said, in an under tone, `It is your man, Harry, is it not?' `Yes, and I —' `Not now. Time enough. This is no time nor place. He is ours, and we will sift him soon as this gale is out! Keep quiet, and compose yourself, and be thankful for our success! I need n't have asked you, to be sure, if he was the right fellow, for he could be nobody else than precisely your villain! Come, sir,' added Forrestal, turning to his prisoner, `you will please, for the present, regard yourself as my prisoner!' `By what authority?' haughtily demanded Ingles. `That I will explain by and by, when we can hear each other speak better. The irons, gunner?' `They are here, sir!' `Put them on him!' `Do you bind a shipwrecked man — wrecked by your own vessel?' he demanded, stepping back. `You need not think to deceive me. You are the skipper of the shallop that I have been in chase of up the keys for two days past. You are the wrecker who lay at anchor under the Moro Castle three nights ago! If I find on examination to-morrow I have wronged you, I will make reparation. Will you submit quietly to be manacled?' `This is a dangerous ground your schooner is driving over! Each moment, I warn you, you are in danger of shipwreck!' `I know it, and I mean to come to anchor now I have caught you, sir! I have risked the lives of every man on board, as well as the vessel, to get you in my power, for I should have come to anchor after losing my jib, but for the pleasure of this meeting! Clear away the anchor. Spring lively, men, for it is time now to look to ourselves. Cast the lead, one of you. Look out forward that none of you get caught by a sea and carried overboard in its arms. Luff a little and lay her to the wind, helmsman, close as you can, and check her head as much as you can in safety to the men that are clearing away the anchors. It won't be safe to let her drive this way.' `Quarter-less-six!' sang out the man in the fore-rigging, for there was too much sea yet for him to stand in the chains, though the gale was evidently lessening in its force, and the waves broke seldom and less violently over her stern; while forward she kept her forecastle clearer of seas than she had done ten minutes before. `I submit,' answered the wrecker, sullenly, `but if I must be chained, and your vessel is wrecked, my life be on your hands.' `I will be responsible, Señor,' answered Forrestal, firmly. `Five and a half!' cried the man heaving the lead. `You see it shoals. We are driving ashore!' `More need to have you secure. Gunner, do your duty. Hurry there with the anchor.' `I will see to the men and the anchor, dear Forrestal, if you will only have him chained,' cried Carneil. `That I will do. Forward, and call out when all is ready. We are driving to destruction, and have been; but I have done it to secure this fellow.' Ingles sullenly suffered the gunner, aided by the boatswain, to fasten the manacles upon his wrists. `Now pass that slack of the topsail halyards twice round his waist,' said Forrestal, `and secure him firmly with a double turn to the capstan. If he gets free from that he will have to pull the capstan up from the deck; and, bull-necked as he is, he won't quite do that.' The wrecker was chained and bound as Forrestal had commanded, the key of his hand-cuffs being taken by Harry himself, with a feeling of peculiar satisfaction. Forrestal now gave all his attention to the safety of the schooner. In a few moments the anchor was ready. Men were stationed at the halyards of the fore and main sails, and two placed at the wheel. `Hard-a-lee!' shouted Forrestal, from the starboard main-rigging, into which he had got, better to command the schooner. The bows came round with a leap, as it were, dashing the spray high into the air. `Halyards all!' shouted the commander, and the fore and main sails came down, leaving the schooner without a stitch of canvass. `Now let go the anchor,' cried Forrestal, his voice heard clear and distinct above the raging elements. The noise of the plunge of the anchor was lost in the louder dash of the waves. The twenty fathom of cable was brought up tight in an instant, and the schooner was checked with a shock as if she had struck a rock. `That liked to have knocked her masts out of her,' said Rogers, who we forgot to say accompanied Forrestal and Harry to the schooner from the sloop-of-war; and acted as second in command, next to Carneil. `She drags her anchor, sir!' shouted Harry, from the windlass. `What water have we?' `A quarter-less-five.' `That is not bad for the Banks. I am more afraid now of deepening our soundings, for then I should know we were near an island. Does she drift much, leadsman?' `About four knots.' `That is better than driving twelve. Clear away the other anchor. The best bower is n't enough.' A second anchor was just ready to be dropped, when Carneil reported that the best bower had parted. Forrestal had no need to be told, for the portion in-board flew back, striking the hollow deck with the report of a four pounder; while the vessel began to toss about like a chip in a whirlpool. The other anchor was dropped as soon as the schooner could be brought head-to again, and her way deadened; but this did not hold her so but that she drifted four knots, each moment shoaling her water. The clouds, in the mean while, were growing lighter, not only in the west, but overhead, and there was every sign that the gale would speedily abate. `So long as I do n't get much more nor much less than six fathom, I am safe, Harry. How does the cable hold?' `Well.' `See that it does n't chafe in the hawse-hole.' `It is well served with matting and canvass. There is not so much strain as there was, sir, on the other. The sea is falling. It was a plunge head-foremost, and then the short lift again, that parted the best bower.' `I hope we shall ride it out; for I do n't know where we are. The lead gives black and white grains I see, but this is the same for a hundred miles of latitude on the Banks, at precisely the same depth of water. I only know we are in the channel, but whereabouts, north or south of Abaco, I can't say. One of you go aloft and see if you see any thing of the English light on the key head. It is ten miles south of `The-Hole-in-the-Wall,' and we should see it if we are in its neighborhood, as it is now clearing in the horizon.' `I will go up and see,' answered Rogers. `But this is the region of the false beacon, that all the captains who have been wrecked swear they were misled by, though nobody has ever been able to find a trace of one by the day.' The wrecker's face wore a peculiar smile of exultation and contempt as this remark fell upon his ear. But he remained silent, though his lips moved slightly, as if he would have spoken something. The movement of the muscles of his lips was, however, quite as expressive as words. `What do you see?' called Forrestal to his acting lieutenant, after he had got up in the rigging two thirds of the way to the top-sail-yard. `The waves run so high that by daylight we could n't see more than two miles. I discover nothing.' `She drifts so, sir,' cried Harry, from forward, `that I fear she has slipped her anchor. There does n't seem to be any strain on the cable.' `Give a turn to the windlass and see. I should not wonder if we had lost it; she has been pulling at it ever since it caught itself on the bottom, like a horse trying to snap his bridle.' `The cable comes in freely, sir! we are drifting!' `Then we must take our chance, for there is no knowing where we are. Keep a good look out, Mr. Rogers, for the light. The clouds are breaking and opening fast, and we will soon find out where the schooner is. There is a star already twinkling through a gap in the storm. All hands to make sail. Man the halyards there forward and let us set the reefed fore-sail again. Spring aft here some of you to the main halyards. We must try and carry sail now we have no anchors to hold on by.' `Light ho!' called out the young officer cheerily from the cross-trees, in which he stood swinging to and fro with the roll of the schooner, in fearful arcs of full forty feet sweep from side to side. `Where away?' shouted Forrestal in a joyous tone. `In this direction,' he answered, pointing over the larboard quarter. `I can't tell how it bears, as we have no compass, sir.' `The gale blows from the south and west,' said Forrestal, thoughtfully; `we must be driving now towards the north and east. The light bears then about W. S. W. We are in the channel, there is no doubt of that, and have been bowling straight through it all along, or we should have been brought up by some of these islands or keys long since. There is no other light in this region than the English light, and this must be it, for I calculated we could not be far from its neighborhood. I will go aloft and see for myself. I see it now,' he said to Rogers, after he had got up a dozen ratlins; `it is the English light. I know now where we are. Now if we had a bowsprit we could soon run up and make a harbor, for there is good anchorage there.' `The gale has nearly blown itself out, sir,' said Harry to him as he came down upon deck. `Shall I see to fitting a spar for a temporary bowsprit? We can rig one in an hour, and in another hour bend another jib.' `You are born for a sailor, Harry. I was about to give you orders to do this very thing.' Harry sprung forward, involuntarily shrinking with a gesture and glance of fear as he passed the wrecker, who stood silent and gloomy with his manacled arms crossed upon his breast, and listening with an air of scorn, and at times with a derisive smile on his lip, at the conversation of the officers. Forrestal went below to examine his chart. He unrolled it before him upon the table, and soon ascertained exactly where he would be likely to be, the light bearing in a certain quarter. `I am,' he mused, revolving his calculations in his mind, `I am about six miles south of “The-Hole-in-the-Wall,” and about five distant from that light, and this will make the schooner here,' he said, making a point with his compasses nearly half way between `The-Hole-in-the-Wall' and the English light. `Here is my position, and I am going this course to the N. N. E. at the 10 rate of nine knot under my reefed fore-sail and main-sail! This is my place on the chart, if the gale has not veered and still blows as it did when it began, from the south.' `It has abated enough, sir,' called Rogers from the companion-way, `to shake a reef out of both sails.' `Then make more sail and set the fore-top-sail close reefed.' `Ay, ay, sir.' `The wind, I think, still holds where it did, for the waves roll with a regular onward swell, which they would not do if the wind had chopped. Besides, I see no varying of the mercury in the thermometer, which any change of the wind to a point more northerly would affect instantly. So I will make my course accordingly for the light.' `The new bow-sprit is in hand, Mr. Forrestal,' said Harry, coming into the cabin, `and it will soon be run out. I have every spare hand at work either hewing, rigging in stays for the jib, getting ready to bend on the jib, or reeving halyards. In less than half an hour we shall have the sail set.' `You have done well, Harry. There is our position,' and he placed the point of his dividers in the place he had before marked. `The light bears so! the wind comes from about S. by W. and we are here. I shall go about as soon as I can carry the jib, and try to make the light for a harbor.' `The sea is going down and we shall soon have a clear sky and less wind.' `I hope so. Your man on deck, Harry, looks as if he would like to have us all go to the bottom together.' `I shudder, even to pass him! All he made me suffer when a boy rushes upon my memory, and I tremble as I did then. But I will conquer this.' `You are sure it is the man?' asked Forrestal, looking in his face earnestly. `Yes; I cannot be mistaken.' `Has he noticed you? Does he seem to recognize you at all?' `No; he has noticed me only by the remark you heard him make.' `It was a singular remark to be made to you, if he is the man and did not know who you were. I am glad you are so positive, for in binding him I have taken a great responsibility; for he might have been only a poor wrecker. Half of them you know look like bucaneers, so this man's looks are not evidence enough against him.' `I can tell you how you can be convinced. I remember that the man who tore me and my sister Isidore from our home had lost his small toe from the right foot. I used often to see him wash his feet in the cabin when I was in his power, and this circumstance made a strong impression upon me.' `This, then, will be evidence enough. What has he on his feet?' `Spanish boots of untanned skin,' answered Harry, going up the companion-way and looking at the prisoner, who stood where the light of the battle-lantern could expose every movement. `This matter shall be decided at once.' `I do n't need any such proof; for I am positive, Mr. Forrestal. He avoids my eye. I am glad he is bound.' `I have bound him lest he should do you a harm, for he cannot escape unless we are shipwrecked. Sir Spaniard,' said Forrestal, who did not wish him to suspect his purpose, `I know it is the custom of your countrymen to conceal knives in your sleeves, girdles, and even your boots. I wish to deprive you of any such means of doing mischief. You will suffer the boatswain to search you.' He made no reply, but smiled scornfully, and unfolding his arms, permitted the boatswain to examine his sash, and then his sleeves. `Now his boots!' said Forrestal, with deep interest in this part of the proceeding. The left boot was removed and held up and shaken by the earnest and thorough-searching sailor; but no knife fell from it. `Now the other!' The wrecker put out this foot with the same air of defiance and derision he had offered the other. He seemed to feel a pleasure in disappointing them; for he could have no suspicion of a deeper motive than that which had been given for the removal of his boots. He could not even have any idea of the use that might be made of any discovery that should be made of a physical defect. `There is nothing here, sir,' said the boatswain. At the same instant Forrestal felt Harry nervously pressing upon his arm. `Very well, help him put on his boots again,' answered Forrestal to the boatswain. `I am sorry to trouble you, Señor, but I wish to be secure.' `You saw it, Mr. Forrestal!' exclaimed Harry, drawing him down into the cabin. `Yes; and now all my doubts are removed. That man shall stick to me and I to him till all you wish to know is known.'</field>
      <field name="fulltext">10* CHAPTER IX. The Beacon Light. The singular discovery made by Forrestal with which the last chapter concluded, removed at once every doubt that might before have existed as to the identity of the man they had so wonderfully got into their power, with the person who had taken away Isidore. Harry had no need of this confirmation. The recognition from the first had been unhesitating and without a doubt in his mind. `Now that you are convinced, my dear Mr. Forrestal,' said Harry, earnestly, his cheek glowing with his zealous solicitude, `let there be no delay in bringing him into the cabin and making him answer truly, with his life at your feet, where my sister is. I would have asked him at once to his face, had you not checked and bade me wait. I have waited.' `There is now no opportunity to question him as I wish to, dear Harry,' said his friend, smiling. `He is safe enough for the present. As soon as you get the bow-sprit rigged and the jib on, I will tack ship and lay her course for the light. I am afraid to run much longer in this direction; and if I can weather the light there is a snug harbor there that I can lay in, with the schooner against the rock, as at a pier. There we must lay until I can send some wrecker to Nassau for anchors and a compass; or till the sloop-of-war arrives on the Banks.' `The light is out of sight, sir,' called Rogers. `Yes, we are drifting away from it every moment. Go, Harry, and drive the men to get on with their work forward as fast as possible. Keep her to the wind, helmsnan! Let her hug it as close as she can!' `Ay, ay, sir! she lays to pretty well now.' In half an hour more the bowsprit was rigged, jib set, and the gale having lessened to a steady nine-knot breeze from the south, the schooner bore up and laid her course for the light, which was just visible from mast-head, glimmering on the horizon like a planet setting in the west. `She lays her course very well, Mr. Forrestal,' said Rogers, who stood by him on the deck; only she throws the spray forward so heavily that no man can stay on the forecastle.' `The light opens fast and bright upon us,' answered Forrestal. `It is now about a league and a half. What soundings have we here? Heave the lead. If we have eight and a half, I know I am right in my calculations as to our whereabouts. The star Aldebaran I caught a glimpse of through the drift a moment ago, and I knew from that my bearings pretty accurately. I am running right.' `No bottom!' called out the leadsman from the lee rigging. `No bottom! How much line did you throw?' `Fifteen fathom, sir.' `This is strange. Run out thirty.' Forrestal walked forward and stood anxiously waiting the result. `No-bor-or-or-to-o-o-m,' sung the man, in the sonorous sing-song strain peculiar to leadsmen. `This is surprising! We must be on soundings! That must be the English light!' cried Forrestal. `Wrecker,' he said, turning to his silent prisoner, `you must know these waters. Is that the English light?' `If an American naval officer does n't know his duty, he must not expect to learn it from a poor wrecker,' answered the man, derisively. `Confound the villain!' said Forrestal to himself, `if I do n't humble your haughty bearing, my fine fellow, ere you and I part!' `Mr. Forrestal,' said Harry, `you can't be too careful. You know this is the part of the Banks on which false beacons were displayed! This may be one! and there is an expression of exulting malignity in that man's face, since he answered you, that leads me to fear this may be a false light you are running for.' `I begin to mistrust, since I find I am not on soundings. On the chart I should have eight fathoms all along here.' `Deep water!' sang the leadsman. `Have you bottom?' `Yes, sir, at twenty fathom.' `Throw again; this is better.' `Sixteen fathom!' `That is better still! we were out farther than I thought, and are now running in to the regular bank soundings.' `Thirteen fathom!' `I am right! we are correct. It is the English light, if the next heave give us less water.' `Nine and a half!' From nine and a half to eight it continued for nearly ten minutes, when the soundings became so regular that Forrestal's doubts were removed. Moreover he was confirmed by a sneering remark made by the wrecker. You had best be cautious how you run for that light so boldly, master; for I see you fear false beacons. Now I think it more than probable that is one; so if you take my advice you will run farther to the south.' `This man's words decide my course,' said Forrestal to his young officers. `I know well that this is the neighborhood of the false lights that the captains of the two ships say misled them; though the Spanish cruiser that went to find them returned, saying there was no signs of any.' Forrestal felt a slight touch, and catching Harry's eye, was directed by its glance to the face of the wrecker. Its expression was one of singular exultation. `This man is a very devil. I do n't know what to make of him,' said Forrestal to his friend. `But I will bring him up with a round turn, soon as I get the schooner in safety.' The light now opened so round and clear, being about two and a half miles distant, that Forrestal was satisfied it was the English light, which he had often seen. `No wreckers could show a light like that,' he said. `We are right. Keep a good look-out there forward for land!' `Ay, ay, sir!' `Rogers, take your place forward, and keep watch. We are running in now very freely. The lead speaks correctly, and I think we are safe in running. It is impossible this should be a false light, for then where is the English light? We must see two lights, if we see one!' `That is true,' answered Rogers. `We shall have a heavy rain out of that black cloud upon us soon, that will hide it,' said Forrestal. `We have had the wind, and now we are to have a shower.' As he spoke, a flash of lightning, followed by thunder, came from a rain-cloud that had risen in the west after the heaviest of the storm had blown over. It rapidly obscured the few stars, and came upon them with that rapid advance so common in that latitude. In five minutes the rain poured upon the deck in a deluge, while the sea, beaten down by its force, seemed almost without a billow. The light was faintly seen, for a moment, and then was lost in the dense atmosphere of water. `Do you mean to stand on in this course long?' asked the wrecker, suddenly. `Yes. I know where I am. Why do you ask?' `Because that light, I assure you, is a false one!' he answered, earnestly. `If you wish to save your vessel, you must alter your course several points farther south.' `I shall do, be assured, just the opposite of what you say,' answered Forrestal. `Your object is to mislead me. The rain is lessening,—keep her as she is. Can you see the light ahead there?' `No, sir.' `Keep a bright look-out, Harry! We must run close under it, and leave it a quarter of a mile on the starboard bow, says the chart, and when we get it abeam, steer west northwest, one half north, and that will bring us into the haven behind it.' The schooner continued to stand on. The wrecker appeared very uneasy, and several times ejaculated as if he would speak. He was constantly looking out ahead with anxiety. `You fear, if I run in here, that I shall find men who know you and can bear testimony to some villanies of yours on the Banks,' said Forrestal, observing him. `Light, ho!' shouted several voices. The schooner, advancing obliquely in one direction and the shower in another, suddenly passed out of it, and the light blazed forth not two cables length distant on the lee bow! `Put about, sir, or we are lost!' shouted the wrecker, bounding as if he would break from his confinement. `I hear the roar of breakers!' cried Rogers. `And I see a dark reef dead ahead!' responded Forrestal. `Ready about! Hard down your helm! Luff! Luff! right up into the wind's eye! There is no time nor room to put her away!' cried Forrestal, his voice elevated to its highest pitch. The danger of the schooner was instantly apparent; for the light from the `Tower Rock,' which blazed above them, shed its glare over the angry waters which all around them were lashed into foam by the repelling rocks over which they were breaking. Dark as the night was, Forrestal could see a wall of reef-rocks stretching away to the right and left, and the light which had lured him on to the danger, now served only to show him the fearful trap in which he had been taken. `I told you of your peril,' cried the wrecker. `Now, loose me! Would you have me perish here, bound like a dog?' But he was unheard. Forrestal had sprung to the aid of the helmsman, and every man was exerting himself to get the schooner out of the danger. She obeyed her helm and luffed into the wind with all shivering; but she had got such head-way, and the seas set so strongly upon the reef, that, before she could wear and take the wind on the larboard tack, she was lifted upon a large billow and dashed, beam on, upon the jagged rocks that rose above the surface on all sides of them. She struck with such force, as the wave passed from under her, that her masts went by the board, shivering upon the sharp rocks as they fell. Another wave bore the bull farther on, and letting her fall heavily upon a cleft in the reef, there she became firmly wedged in. The next billow leaped over her with a wild roar that drowned the cries of the mariners, who were seeking safety by every means within their reach. `Be cool, men,' cried Forrestal, `and try to reach the rocks over the stern, between the coming of the seas. Harry, you stand by me. Rogers, see that the men do not throw themselves over rashly, to be dashed to pieces! Now, men, is your time!' By great exertions, nearly all the sailors reached the rocks above the surges. The light which had led them on to ruin blazing brilliantly down upon the scene of death and devastation. At intervals from the shore, and as it seemed on the summit of a tall cliff that hung over them a cable's length off, came to their ears a wild savage shout of triumph. It seemed as if a demon was exulting over the ruin below him. `Now, for our safety, Harry! Wait till the next wave passes over us. Lay close to the deck, when you see it coming!' `But the man! Hear him call upon us and curse us!' `I mean to free him as soon as the next sea clears us, and give him his chance with us!' `If he is lost, all my hopes —' Harry's words were broken off by Forrestal's pulling him flat upon the deck. The wrecker, who had been struggling to free himself, and calling for aid, crouched behind the capstan, to let it swoop over him. Its force and weight broke the hull near the main-mast, leaving him on the more forward part, alone! Forrestal and Harry were irresistibly borne upon the surge from the deck and lodged together upon a rock, to which they clung. Aided by Rogers, and the men who had already got ashore, they were lifted from this place, from which the next wave would have washed them, to a shelf on which they stood above its reach. The first thought Forrestal had, was of the wrecker. The man was seen by the glare of the beacon, still bound to the capstan, and each moment the part of the wreck he was on was sinking lower and lower, as it slid from the rock. His cries were more like those of a wild beast, than human! He writhed and struggled 11 and plunged with mad but impotent efforts to free himself. `He will perish! I should have released him before, but the schooner struck so suddenly, it was out of my power!' said Forrestal, with pity and grief. `I care not so much for the villain's life, but for you, Harry! Yet, I would not like a man should perish, bound, whoever he is, without giving him a chance for his life. Nor shall he perish!' With a generous impulse, Forrestal made a spring to reach the wreck, when the gunner caught him and held him back with a strong arm. `It will be death, Captain Forrestal!' He had hardly spoken before there was a general cry from Rogers and the men, and Harry Carneil the next moment was seen swimming amid the surges. `Harry!' cried Forrestal, with horror; and but for Rogers and the others, he would have plunged after him. Two seamen, however, did so at the risk of their lives. One was driven back by the waves, but the other, diving, as did Harry, let it pass over. The next moment the daring boy was by the side of the man whom he most feared and hated on earth, but whose life he would rather save than any man's living, — not excepting, perhaps, even Forrestal's! `You come to save me, boy!' cried the man, looking upon him with a singular expression of ferocity. `Yes. You shall not die yet!' answered Harry, casting off the strong rope that bound the man to the capstan, and which he had stranded in his superhuman efforts to liberate himself. The bonds were loosened and the man stood free, save his manacles, which gave his hands about twenty inches play, — this being the length of the chain connecting the hand-cuffs. `Now, your hand-cuffs!' said the determined boy, taking the key from his pocket to unlock them. While he was doing it, the light of the Tower was suddenly extinguished. `One word, now,' said the wrecker, flinging his chains into the surf. `Do you know who I am?' The wrecker spoke in English, with his mouth close to his ear. `Yes, villain!' `And you have pursued me to take me, because you recognize me!' `Yes!' `Then know, before you die, for die you shall, if I have to drown myself to drown you, that your sister lives, and is in my power!' As he spoke, he caught him up and sprung over the stern with him into the boiling surge. The sudden extinction of the light, after the prey had been taken, to prevent the discovery of its position, prevented Forrestal from seeing what was done, though he was also on the wreck again, having risked his life to save that of Harry. But as he reached the capstan, he heard Harry's wild shriek ring above the roar of the billows, as the monster plunged with him into the mad waters. Forgetful of all else but his young friend's safety, and divining, from his knowledge of the facts of Harry's life, and of the character of the man, that he was attempting his destruction, he did not hesitate to leap after them. It was pitchy dark, but he heard near him, in the water, a gurgling cry and swam in that direction with all his force. The next moment he felt his foot strike something beneath him, which yielded. He dove and buried his hand in the wiry hair of the wrecker. Another grasp lower down and he held him by the throat. The wrecker, who had sunk beneath the surface to keep his victim under water till he should drown him, knowing, from his experience in swimming, that he would outlast him in breath, at once rose to the top of the water, but releasing his hold of Harry and thrusting him far beneath him. He then grappled with Forrestal. The latter, however, held his advantage of having him by the throat, and, although the wrecker clung to his waist and sunk with him, he did not release his hold. Suddenly, he found Harry's hand pass across his face and his grasp upon his arm. To save him, he instantly released the wrecker's throat, dashed his fist into his face, and, catching Carneil in his arm, rose to the surface with him, and after an arduous struggle, gained, first the wreck, and then the rocks. `Has he drowned, sir?' were Harry's first words, after being able to articulate, which was not for five minutes after the men had got him and Forrestal beyond the reach of the waves. `God knows! I hope so, the incarnate demon!' answered Forrestal, who was chafing his young friend's temples and hands with the tenderness of a brother. `O, no, no! He must not perish! Save him, dear Forrestal! All depends on him! All is lost if he die!' `It cant be helped, Harry. He may have got to the reef, but it is so dark here we can see nothing. If he is saved, we can secure him. `O, I hope so! I hope he is saved! He told me my sister lives, and is in his power! `Did he say this?' `Yes. After I had released him, he asked me if I knew him. I told him, yes. He asked if I had pursued him because I recognized him. I said, I had. He then said, in the most savage manner, `that he would let me know, before I died, that my sister lived, and was in his power. He then caught me up and said I should drown, if he had to drown with me!' `The man is a fiend! This is wonderful, you tell me! His revenge against you is wonderful! Never was a person involved in such mysteries as seem thrown around you! I do hope the man has got to the rocks safely! But our shipwreck, Rogers! This is a most singular affair!' `That light was not the English light.' `It was the prince of darkness, holding out a lantern to lead us on, rather. I now believe that there is a false light, and that we have been running for it. And the fact that it has been put out, so soon as it was discovered a vessel had come ashore!' `If it is a false light, it is on Abaco Point, just where the captain said, and we are ten miles north of the English light. One thing is certain, — we are wrecked on a long reef, as we can tell by the roar to the right of us, running south of the light we were steering for, and such a reef is no where near the English light; but there is such a one stretching off south of `The-Hole-in-the-Wall,' on Abaco Island; and on that reef we 11* are, I am very well convinced. But now we are here, I dont leave the Island till I know all about this beacon affair. If it is to be found, and those who kindle it are to be found, they wont escape us. If I could sift this matter to the bottom, and catch these monsters, who thus murder seamen by wholesale, I would not regret the loss of the schooner.' `What time does the moon rise?' asked Rogers. `At about an hour after midnight. By feeling the hands of my watch, that goes still, with all its wetting, I find that it is now just twelve; for they are both close together at the handle. We will wait here quietly till we get the light of the moon, and then move to better quarters. Dont despair, Harry, we may catch your man skulking about the rocks yet.' `The sea is falling fast, sir,' said the boatswain; `I think by the time the moon is up, we can get on board the wreck and get arms as well as provisions If this is the `Light of the Reef,' that has lured us on here to-night, we are likely to need something to defend ourselves against the villains, as well as help us capture the whole nest of 'em.' `The fellow was right when he cautioned me about steering for the light,' said Forrestal. `It was to save himself, when he found we were likely to be wrecked; as he knew the light he must be of the gang,' remarked Harry. `Hark! Hear that yell from the cliff!' cried Rogers. `It is the same exulting cry we heard when we struck!' Again it was repeated, and then again, with increased exultation, — a sound something between shrieking and laughter. The men huddled together, appalled with superstitious fear. And as the light had gone out at once, leaving no sign of its ever having existed, they began to whisper among themselves that the devil had more to do with their shipwreck than any wreckers; for they were quite assured that the voice they heard was his. The cry began to be uttered again, when it was suddenly checked, and ended in a yell of pain, while a deep voice was heard, in menacing tones. Then all was silent. `That voice was his!' cried Harry, almost with a shout. `He is saved, Forrestal, he is saved! I felt he would not die with that secret on his soul!'</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER X. The Beacon. The long-wished for moon at length rose, without a cloud far to the north of east, for it was in its third quarter. The clouds had been driven before a northwesterly wind, beyond the horizon of the ocean, and it had become gradually bright star-light above them. As soon as the moon sent her red beams across the sea, which yet rolled its heavy billows landward, but without that wildness which had characterized their motion in the storm that had gone over, as soon as her light would enable him to move with safety upon the rocks, Forrestal ascended an elevated portion of the reef and looked around him. At a glance, he saw that the round swell of the Island, from which the reef shot out, was `the back of Abaco,' and that he had been wrecked on Abaco reef. He therefore was satisfied that the light which had misled him was that false `Light of the Reef,' which had been sworn to in Havana and Nassau, by the captains who had been wrecked as having existence, though many questioned it. He now looked along the jutting bastions of the reef for something that resembled a light-house. He could see nothing. Harry and Rogers were by his side. Harry was looking for `his man,' — Rogers, for the beacon! Suddenly the latter, with an exclamation pointed Forrestal to a glittering object on the top of the needle-like rock, a cable's length, or eight hundred feet, to the north of them, which our readers know as the `Tower Rock.' `It is a reflection of the moonlight upon mica!' said Forrestal. `No — it is globular! and see, as the moon rises, another and another object catches its light; and now there is a circle of bright globes shining like a crown of silver stars in the bright glance of the moonbeams!' `What can it be?' exclaimed Rogers, who, with Harry and Forrestal, had been watching its gradual advance from a single spot to a circle of them. `I can tell!' answered Forrestal. `The secret is out! It is a ring of glass-lamps, hung there towards the sea. It is the very place where the light was when we struck, and, though they were put out, the friendly moon has betrayed their secret covert!' `This is true. I can count the lamps. What an extraordinary discovery!' `Now,' said Forrestal, `to catch the rogues!' `And to catch him, also, dear Forrestal!' `Never fear, Harry! He must be one of them, I imagine, if not their head one! Now I will bless the moonlight after this! But for it we should not have discovered it, for the rock looks inaccessible and as naked as a needle. I should have looked for a beacon or a wood-work affair, — never for a circle of lights hung on the face of a rock. Doubtless, it is taken care of in the day and hid away in some of these caves!' `What will you do now, first, Mr. Forrestal?' asked Carneil. `The wreck can now be boarded by swimming. I will have some of the men go aboard and pass a rope to the reef, and by means of it we will get some boarding pikes and cutlasses, if no pistols or powder, which is doubtless all wet. We will then explore and try and get a footing farther on the Island till morning.' The stern portion of the schooner, abaft the companion-way, which had hung unsupported while the rest of the keel lay upon the reef, had broken off, as has been narrated; but, as full three-quarters of the schooner lay wedged in the rocks, though surrounded by the water, they were enabled to obtain a few cutlasses and pikes, though into the hold of the vessel the sea flowed freely. Arming his men, and placing himself in advance, Forrestal began to move along the reef. The moonlight enabled them to step with safety; but as some parts of the reef were detached from the rest, they had to swim from rock to rock; but as the sea was now comparatively smooth, they were enabled to get on without the loss of any life. Forrestal's object was to reach the base of that columnar portion of the chain of rocks on which he had so singularly discovered the circle of lamps gleaming in the moonbeams. After arduous exertions, on the part of all, they at length got to the foot of this rock. It rose more than forty feet into the air above their heads. He began to examine its base, and at length discovered that it contained fissures and projections that would aid one who should attempt to ascend. He resolved to make the trial, for he knew that the lamps — if lamps they were — could not get there without human means. He found, as he got higher and higher, that the facilities for ascending were greater, until he could mount with celerity, as if up a flight of stairs. These projections, which he found as he advanced, were not apparent from below; so that, to one at the base, the rock appeared inaccessible. This deception had, probably, prevented other shipwrecked men from the attempt now made by Forrestal, and which he would not have made unless he had seen the moon reflected from objects upon the summit, that he believed were lamps composing a beacon. He was followed by Harry and Rogers, whose profession as well as his own, had taught them how to climb. On reaching the shelf, near the top, and walking round to the sea-face of the rock, Forrestal discovered the cavity, with its hoop of lights, its reflector, and all the other apparatus of the spot. He uttered an exclamation that sounded very like an oath, which drew his two officers to the place. For a few moments they stood gazing on the lamps and then on each other, in silent astonishment. `Well, this is a discovery worth the schooner,' said Forrestal, at length. `I don't regret her. Here is the beacon that has played me false, and others before me. I never saw any thing quite up to this!' `I don't wonder the Spanish gun-brig that was sent up here didn't find any thing,' said Rogers. I never should have supposed there was a place up here large enough for a gull to perch on. See what a nice nook is all hollowed out to keep all under cover. The government couldn't ask for a better lighthouse than this, if it was only honestly kept.' `We should see the real light from here,' said Forrestal, looking south. `It is invisible, though the horizon is clear in that direction,' said Harry. `It is very strange. Well, I shall sift this matter to the bottom, all round. We are forty-one, in all, and armed, after a fashion, and we can hold head against these fellows; for there can't be more than this number here, if a dozen. Doubtless, they all about here have a share in the profits of the wrecker, and have a keeper of the light. I hope he nor none of the rest will escape off the Island before day; for the wrecker who got ashore will give the alarm, and let them know they have caught a Tartar, instead of a peaceable merchantman. The sloop-of-war will be along to-morrow, if she has safely weathered the storm, for she was to sail direct for Abaco first, and then cruise up and down the channel. Till she heaves in sight, we must hold together for defence. At daylight, we can judge how it is best to act.' After having carefully examined the ingenious apparatus of the false beacon, the party descended; with more difficulty, however, than the ascent was made. Forrestal let it remain, in order to remove it complete by day. From the top he had discovered that the reef on which he was, and of which the beacon-rock formed a part, was about fifty yards from the end of the cliff, and that `The-Hole-in-the-Wall' was in this cliff about a furlong farther in towards the Island. The gap he could discern, though, from his position, he could not see through the cliff. The sides of it seemed to sink perpendicularly beneath the water, and to afford no path to reach the main even should they reach it. He therefore resolved to remain quietly on the reef till morning with his men; and, each one seeking such shelter as he could, the weary seamen soon fell asleep on their cutlasses. Harry, also, shortly sunk down, overcome with fatigue; but Rogers and Forrestal remained awake to watch; for they knew they were upon a spot where dangerous enemies, doubtless, had their eyes upon them. Forrestal walked up and down a narrow space on the reef, at quarter-deck pace, revolving in his mind the events of the night, — till all that had occurred passed in calm review before his mind. He could not but give vent again and again to his astonishment in audible exclamations, as he thought upon the wonderful discovery he had made at the top of the rock, and upon the singular instrumentality by which the reflector had been revealed. His thoughts then dwelt upon the extraordinary man he had taken prisoner, and upon his mysterious connection with Carneil; and as he revolved the whole subject in his thoughts, he came to the conclusion, in connection with the wrecker's knowledge of the beacon, that the man was one of the piratical beacon-wreckers who were concerned in this false `Light of the Reef;' and that, in pursuing Harry's villain, he had been pursuing, also, one of the pirates of the Keys, against whom the schooner and sloop had been ordered to cruise. `If,' said he, turning to Rogers, and speaking aloud his thoughts, `if this fellow who got ashore is one of this “Hole-in-the-Wall” gang, then he must have a dwelling somewhere on the Island; and there it is we must look for that poor girl.' `What poor girl, sir?' asked Rogers. 12 `O, ah! I forgot. You don't know Harry's story. Well, to beguile the time, I'll relate it to you; for you ought to know a twofold motive we have in getting this man into our possession again.' Taking the arm of the midshipman, Forrestal then began to relate the story, as he walked up and down the rock,—the waves, the while, breaking at their feet,— the moonlight silvering the heaving ocean in a long, bright path, — the dark rocks towering above them, and the groups of men sleeping around. `Now, Mr. Rogers,' he said, as he ended the long recital, now you can account for poor Harry's anxiety to save the man alive; for in his wicked breast was locked up the secret of his sister's fate, — nay, of his own parentage and birthplace!' `And also, now the cause of his springing into the harbor when he recognized the man. We thought him crazy.' `It is enough, this uncertainty, to make him so. Do you know that I begin to suspect that fellow, Vique, who escaped when we were off Double-Headed Shot Keys, at night, belonged to these wreckers? His face always wore, I noticed, a peculiar expression, when he heard me speak of capturing them; and then he boasted their skill in avoiding cruisers, as if he knew more of them than he cared I should guess. Now, I believe that fellow was as bad as any of them, and got away from the schooner because he was afraid of being found out.' `He would not have left her where he did, sir, if he had not been sure of meeting friends, I think.' `That is my opinion. List! Do you not see an object moving on the cliff? Stand perfectly quiet, and direct your eye where my finger points.' `It is a man, stooping.' `So I thought. It is a wrecker, watching us. Let us be quiet. We are in shadow and unseen, while the moon reveals him. Let us observe his motions. He is creeping low. Now he is stationary.' In a few moments the individual disappeared, and they saw no more of him, or any other moving object, for at least twenty minutes, when Forrestal detected a small boat emerge from `The-Hole-in-the-Wall,' and pull towards the reef, keeping close under the cliff. It moved with noiscless progress, but came steadily on. As it approached, they could discern one person in her only, who was rowing with two oars. `That must be the man who was on the cliff. He was watching if he could discover us; and as the men are all sleeping in sheltered nooks, and we have a rock between us and the moon, he has seen no one, and is doubtless coming to destroy or preserve from our discovery his reflector and lamps. He can have no other motive in thus stealing along and coming so near.' The boat now left the cliff and began to cross the narrow space of water between it and the reef, the moonlight shining clearly upon it. It now pulled on swiftly, but still with a noiseless dip of the oars. `Whoever he is, or whatever his purpose, he is cautious enough,' said Rogers, in a whisper, for the boat was within ten fathom of them. `See, how low he crouches in the bottom!' `He has turned his face. He is a negro. Let us be as cautious as he, and we shall yet have him in our power. Doubtless, he supposes we are all down by the wreck, or else are asleep. Keep close, and be ready to aid me, if he lands.' The next moment, the boat touched the reef just above where the men were sleeping, and where they were concealed, and instead of a man, to their astonishment out sprung a monster! It was Lobo. He had placed his hands upon the rock and thrown his body out by turning a summerset and lighting upon the stumps, that should have been legs. Acting as if secure from observation, he then began to go over the rocks towards the base of the beacon, throwing himself forward on his hands after a fashion that excited the astonishment both of Forrestal and his companion. `It is the devil himself,' said Rogers, with emphasis. `Then let us take him prisoner,' answered Forrestal, laughing. `It will be doing mankind incalculable service. Look at him now. He is listening. You see he is a deformed African. Now he moves again dexterously, using his arms for legs. He is making for the foot of the beacon-rock. His object is either to destroy or secrete the apparatus. The fellow has masters over him. He is not the prime mover. It must have been this monster whose yells we heard.' `How can he get up that rock?' `Let us watch him. See that! He goes up hand over hand, like a sailor up a rope. He must have the strength of a giant in his arms to lift his body in the air in that style. Now, come and let us take him, before he can injure what I wish to preserve as a curiosity as well as a trophy.' The two officers sprung forward, each with his cutlass drawn, and Forrestal reaching the foot of the rock, called out to him. Lobo stopped mid air, and looking down, gave expression to his surprise and alarm in a deep Spanish execration. `Come down, Muchacho,' commanded Forrestal in Spanish, `or I will come after you and cut you down by the wrists!' The only reply he got was something like a growl, and the savage rapidly ascended till he reached the top. Forrestal sprung after him, holding his cutlass between his teeth. When he had got up ten feet, a fragment of the rock, torn off by the negro from the mass, came bounding down, and leaping over Forrestal's head within an inch of it, plunged into the sea. Forrestal, exasperated at this attack, redoubled his exertions, and soon stood upon the top. Lobo threw himself over, at the same instant, into the cavity that held the lamps. Forrestal followed him and presented his cutlass at his throat, as he crouched in a corner of the nook, grinding his teeth like a wolf in his lair. `Monster, will you yield, or shall I kill you?' `I be massa's slave, massa no kill,' answered Lobo, covering his face at the sight of the weapon. `Then go down, and I will follow you. Try to escape, and the officer below will slice your huge head from its shoulders!' `I no try get 'way, massa,' answered the African, who, finding escape no longer possible, had, all at once, changed animal ferocity into slavish submission. Lobo descended the same way he had gone up, by the aid of his hands, and not a little to the amazement of Harry, the boatswain, and two or three of the seamen, whom the noise of the falling fragment had awakened. Rogers, in a few words, explained how he came there, and that he was, probably, an agent of the pirate-wreckers. On reaching the bottom of the tower, Forrestal said to the slave, laying the flat of his cutlass upon his shoulder, `Now, Muchacho, your life depends on your speaking the truth. Deceive me, and you die!' `I speak true, massa,' growled Lobo, trying to look very virtuous and innocent, — but making, in the effort, grimaces so diabolical that the sailors were confirmed in their original opinion, formed when they saw him coming down the rock, that he was the prince of evil; and that he was without legs because he had a pair of black wings folded up under his arms. This was both the gunner's and boatswain's opinion, in which they were sustained by that of nearly every one of the men. `What have you to do with that beacon?' `Me fill de lamp, me burnish him, me light him, me take car' ob him.' `You do, do you? And who is your master?' `Massa Capitan Ingles.' `Is that his name — Ingles?' `Him name, massa.' `He put the light there, and you take care of it?' `Yes, me and Dory.' `Who is Dory?' `Massa's Dory.' `Where does this precious master of yours live?' `I nebber tell, if you cut nigger head orf!' `Then your head shall go off quickly; for, you rascal, you confess you lighted the false beacon which wrecked us.' `Yah, yah! Yes, massa.' `The black devil laughs at his mischief,' exclaimed the gunner with a burst of indignation, in which all the crew joined, — for by this time they were all gathered round Forrestal and the negro. `You see these men. They will tear you in pieces, if I say the word.' `Massa Ingles kill me, if me tell. You kill me, me no tell,' said Lobo, trembling at the angry faces around him. `If you will show me where the habitation is of the man or men, or rather, fiends, who light this beacon, you shall be protected, not only from your master, but the vengeance of these shipwrecked seamen.' `Will you swear massa Ingles no hurt me?' `Yes. How many has he with him? Is he captain of the gang?' `He hab in de cave livin wid him no more dan Lobo, Jover, and Dory.' `Who is Lobo?' `Me, Lobo.' `Who is Jover?' `De big dog, what watch Dory.' `And who is Dory, — a monkey, I dare say?' `No, a woman, — a litty young woman. She got eye blue, like de sky. `Be patient, dear Harry! There is nothing here yet to raise hope. His master may not be our wrecker.' `Had your master gray hair?' asked Harry, eagerly. `Yes, young massa.' `Had he lost any one of his fingers?' asked Harry, with singular discretion, so as not to put a leading question, by asking that he meant this should lead to. `No, not on he hand; but he hab loss one orf he right foot. I wish he lose em all, and he leg, too, and den he be like Lobo!' `It is our man! You are right, Harry. Providence is in this, be assured, and so take courage. Has your master been off the Island?' `Yes, massa, more den week.' `And he came back to-night?' `Yah. You know dat! He in you schooner, and cuss you coz you wreck him, too! Yah, yah, yah! I larf, coz massa get wreck too. He mos drown. But he no so drown he no mos killee me, coz I glad, too, I see de schooner on de reef. He come catch me larfin, and beatee me like de debbel, till me yell.' `Where is he?' asked Forrestal, intensely interested, and hardly able to command that patience necessary to enable him to get the information he sought. Poor Harry was almost wild with expectation. `In de cave, massa.' `Where is this cave?' `Ober dere in de cliff,' he answered, pointing. `Will you take me there in your boat?' `Massa Ingles kill me.' `I will protect you. I and these young officers shall go with me, and these two stout men here, my gunner and boatswain. We will protect you from the man you dread, only show us the cave where your master, the wrecker, has his habitation.' `But he will set Jover on me!' `Into the boat, and pull me to the place. If you deceive me, you shall be slain.' `If you will kill massa, me be you slave?' `It is your master we want. We are his enemy, but your friend.' `Den me go show you,' replied Lobo, with a leer of animal delight that was truly ferocious. The negro swayed his body to the slender oars, and pulled the heavily laden boat across the space to the cliff, and then skirting it, suddenly passed from the sight of the men on the reef, as it turned into the passage of `The-Hole-in-the-Wall.' We briefly conclude our Tale. The young girl was found, recognized by her brother, and restored to civilized society. She was educated, and became the bride of Forrestal. The old man refused to divulge the names of his victims, and, making an attempt on Harry's life, was killed by Forrestal. Lobo, terrified, threw himself into the sea. An advertisement in the English papers brought the mystery to light. `Ingles' proved to be the natural brother of the Earl of Taverston, the father of Harry and his sister; and revenge, so far as could be ascertained, alone dictated his conduct towards his nephew and niece.</field>
