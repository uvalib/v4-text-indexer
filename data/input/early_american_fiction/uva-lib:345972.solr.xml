      <field name="fulltext">MODERN CHIVALRY: VOL. IV.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Vol. IV. A MODERN CHIVALRY. A Chapter to be referred to the third Volume, at the Conclusion. Not withstanding the fairy scene of imagination with respect to the advancement of Teague, in which the Captain had suffered himself to be engaged; yet sometimes he would begin to doubt with regard to the reality of the prospects, and to question whether, after all, it was probable that the executive of the United States would think him adequate to the discharge of judicial or ministerial functions, and appoint him accordingly. Ruminating one day on this subject, a servant presented a billet: It was from the President of the United States, expressing a desire to see the Captain, and to converse with him relative to the appointment of the young man in his service, of the name of Teague O'Regan, to some office in the government. Nothing could be more opportune: for the Captain at that moment, weary weary of his charge, and dispairing of success, was just about to re inquish all further prosecution of his object, and to remand Teague to his boot-cleaning and horse currying as formerly. It may easily be supposed that he lost no time in having his coat and hat brushed, and setting out to wait on his excellency. Presenting himself, he was asked to fit down; and the conversation opening on the subject of Teague, and his qualifications for office. The Captain not willing to be the means of deception in the introduction of his valet, thought proper to deal candidly with his excellency, and to give him an exact account of the education and history of the bog-trotter; that if, on a full view of his character, he should think proper to appoint him, the responsibility might lie with himself. For to be candid, faid the Captain, I should doubt the expediency of appointing him, in the first instance, to any of the higher offices of government. Such as Secretary of State, or even that of Secretary at War; though, I presume, requiring less talents than the former: The business of a soldier lying more in the heart than the head. As to Secretary of the Treasury, should bar that altogether; as it might be unsafe unsafe all at once to trust him with too much money, until he had given greater proofs of fidelity in this particular, than those of his nation and rank are usually found to possess. The diplomatic line might suit him best, were it not that the sending him off the continent will put him out of the way of that superintendence which for some time I myself am willing to take of him, until he shall have acquired habits of diligence, and principles of integrity in business. The President smiled, doubtless at the idea of the Sans Cullotte (for such I figuratively call him, because he had now got on breeches,) being at all in the way of appointment to such trusts; for a thought of the kind had never come into his mind. He was thinking of an office of much less dignity, and which came nearer to the capacity and grade of ordinary education. It was that of an excise officer. Having mentioned this, the Captain approved of it, and thanked his excellency, and took his leave. Teague having received his commission, was elated beyond measure, and impatient to fet out to his district, in order to enter on the functions of his office. The Captain having purchased him a horse, for he refused to bog-trot any longer, the revenue officer took leave of his old master, who had previously given him much good advice with regard to duty in office, and promised to follow him, as soon as he could provide himself with another servant, that he might be on the spot to give him countenance, and assist him occasionally, with such farther lessons of prudence and morality, as his experience in life might enable him to give, and which it could not be unbecoming in one of his age, however dignified by office, to receive.BOOK</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A2 BOOK I. CHAP. I. TEAGUE having thus departed, it became the Captain to look out for another servant; and deliberating on this subject, Mr. M`Donald the Scotch gentleman, of whom we have before spoken, happening to enter, the Captain explained to him the circumstance, and made enquiries with regard to his knowledge of any one that chose to be employed in this way, and might be fit for the service. Said Mr. M`Donald, I ken a lad right weel of the name o' Duncan Ferguson, frae about Perth in Scotland, that is trusty and vera fit to wait upon a gentleman, except it be that he may gie ye o'er muckle trouble about religion, having had a vera strict education i' the presbytery; gin ye can put up wie that, I fal warrant him honest, and vera vera faithful to his master, and that he take guid care of your horse. He is about thirty years of age, and has been a guid deal in service, and knows what it is to wait on guid houses, in his ain kintra; I dina ken how he may suit all places in these parts; but wie a man of your judgment, I think he may do vera weel. The Captain thanked him for the information; and having conceived a good opinion of Mr. M`Donald's integrity and sense, he was willing to take the young man upon the recommendation he had given. Accordingly he being sent for by Mr. M`Donald, the North Briton came, and presented himself to the Captain. The wages of his service being agreed upon, he entered on his functions the same day; and in a short time the Captain having paid his bills in the city, set out with Duncan on the same rout with Teague.CHAP CHAP. II. DUNCAN in like manner with Teague had to walk on foot, for the Captain could not afford to purchase another horse, more especially as he had considerably exhausted his finances, by the late equipment of Teague. But even could he have made it convenient to have increased his cavalry, the expences of travelling would have been increased, which he could not also well afford; or which it would not have been within the limits of a discreet economy to have incurred. For travelling slowly, the servant could without weariness equal the pace of his master on horse-back. Besides, it gave diversity, and had more the air of ancient custom, than being both mounted. It was in this manner, the Gauls who fought with Cæsar equipped their dragoons, as we learn from the Commentaries; and also the Numidian horse under Jugurtha, as we learn from salust Salust, had each a foot-man by his side, who sometimes assisted himself by the mane of the quardruped in running; but was at all times considered as attached to the rider, and ready to subserve him in battle. The Scotchman, moreover, had but a light luggage to carry; being nothing more than a couple of shirts, a pair of stockings, a Kilmarnock cap, a Confession of Faith, Satan's invisible kingdom discovered, and Crookshank's history of the Covenanters. It was upon the topic of religion that the conversation first turned, Duncan asking the Captain of what denomination he was. I am denominated Captain, said he; but my name is John Farrago, though I have had other epithets occasionally given me by the people amongst whom I have happened to sojourn, especially since my last setting out on my travels, after the manner of the antient chevaliers. I have been called the modern Don Quixotte, on account of the eccentricity of my rambles, or the singularity which they conceive themselves to discover in my conversation and manner. I have been called the Knight of the single Horse, having but one myself, and none for my attendant; in this particular unlike my predecessors, whose squires were mounted mounted as well as themselves. In some places I have taken my designation from the Irish valet that I had, and of whom you have heard me speak, of the name of Teague, and have been called the Owner of the red-headed Bog-trotter; as it is probable I may now be designed occasionally by the appellation of the Master of the raw Scotchman, by those who may be able by your dialect to dislinguish your origin. But all these things I look upon as inconsiderable. It is of little, or perhaps of no consequence to me, what my stile is amongst men; provided it contains nothing in it that may impeach my moral character, and may seem to have been drawn from some bad quality or vicious habit of the intellect. They may call me Don Quixotte, or Hudibras, or the Knight of the Blue Beard, or the Long Nose, or what they please. It is all the fame to me; and gives no affront, unless containing a reflection on my understanding or integrity. Captain, said Duncan, it canna be, but ye ken right weel what I mean. It is na the denomination o' your temporal capacity, that I wad be at; but of your religion, and to what perswasion ye belong; whether er o' the Covenant, or of the Seceders, or the high kirk o' Scotland. Duncan, said the Captain, I am not such an adept in faith, as to be acquainted with these nice distinctions. I have some knowledge of the Christian religion in general, but not of those more minute subdivisions of which it is probable you speak. For I have understood that Christianity is the national religion in Scotland, and I presume what you call Covenanters, and Seceders, are sections from the general establishment, and subordinate to the worship of the kingdom. It has not come in my way, nor have I much ambition to be more particularly acquainted. There is a degree of information on most subjects which it becomes a gentleman to have; but the going beyond this may favour of pednatry, and argue the having spent more time in trifles, than bespeaks strength of mind and elevated talents. Just as we respect the naturalist who amuses us with the philosophy of great objects; but smile at him whose life is occupied in catching butterflies, or gathering petrified shell-fish. Or to give a simile that conveys my meaning better; skill in language, either to write or speak, is a noble attainment; but this consists more in a a just taste of the leading beauties, than in the criticisms of a mere grammarian, which shew the mind to have been wholly or chiefly taken up with these: To use the words of the poet, Word-catchers that live on syllables. Commas and points they set exactly right, And 'twere a fin, to rob them of their might. The most liberal studies may be pursued to an illiberal excess; as for instance in music, where it must be considered as an elegant accomplishment to have some talents; yet not to have made such proficiency in the execution, as to induce a suspicion of attention to this art, to the neglect of others. I have taken care to acquire a general knowledge of the surface of this earth, from the maps; yet have not made myself master of the situation of every slough, or bog that may be found in your country, or exact bearing of hill or mountain there. In the same manner, I may know that you are Christians in that island, but nothing more. What, man! said Duncan, ha' ye never heard o' the Solemn League and Covenanr. I have heard, said the Captain, of many Leagues and Covenants. In the time of of Henry IV. in France there was what was called the League. The family of Guise was at the head of this, and opposed to the Protestants. It is probably a branch of this that has come over into Scotland, and kept up the name, after having been broken by that heroic Prince, and afterwards taken away altogether, by his conversion to the mother church, and peaceable possession of the kingdom. By that, ye wad make out the Covenanters to be a relict of Popery, said Duncan. I ken ye right weel, Captain; ye canna be sae ignorant as not to know that the Covenanters are the very reverse o' Popery. Did ye never read Crookshanks? Did ye never hear o' the persecution. I have heard of the ten persecution under the Roman Emperors, said the Captain. Under ten Deevils, faid Duncan. I am speaking o' the persecutions in Scotland; when the ministers were hanged at Ayr. The Captain saw that his valet was beginning to be warm on the score of religion; and that it would be difficult to continue the conversation in any shape without giving him offence. He was therefore disposed to address his pride, and please him by Vol. IV. B by an acknowledgement of ignorance; at the same time proposing a readiness to be instructed in the peculiar tenets of the faith of the Covenanters. Duncan, said he, you are under a mistake as to the opportunities of education in this country. It is not as in Scotland, where the Christian religion has been planted above a thousand years, and the reformed church established a century or two; where clergymen are numerous, and religious books plenty. Ay, said Duncan, where ye have preaching amaist every day of the week, and twice on the Sabbath. Ye canna set your face any way, but ye hae a kirk before you. Catechizing o' the children begins amaist as soon as they are born; and examining the grown people, in visits at the house; wie a strict discipline, that calls to the session for things that scandalize the morals. Ye sal find many guid bukes there published by the Erskines, and the Gillises. Did ye e'er read Peden's Prophesies? I have read nothing of this kind, said the Captain; for I was observing to you, that in America we have not these opportunities. For my own part, I have lived a good deal in the rout of clerical functionaries, where they have passed and and repassed, and have heard their sermons, and conversed with them; and though they may have been distinguished amongst themselves as orthodox or heterodox; or under several names, or by various particulars of doctrine; yet the differences appeared to me so minute, that I never thought it worth while to trace them; and they made themselves acceptable to me, less or more, by the greater harmony of voice, or elegance of language, or gesture; or by the justnses of their observations on the obligations of morality amongst men, and the good consequences to society and to the individual.—Have ye read Willison on the Catechism, or Halyburton, or Boston's Fourfo d State, or Durham on the Revelation? said Duncan. Nothing of all these, said the Captain. Said Duncan, I ha' got the Confession of Faith in my wallet here; I wad lend it to you to get a piece of it by heart, if ye wad promise to take guid care o' the buke. My memory is not good, said the Captain, especially in that artificial exercise of it, which consists in committing abstract ideas. What touches my affections, I remember without trouble, and sentiments which are obvious and natural; and I should think the early mind mind would be better occupied in reading some instructive fables, than in committing these dogmas of divinity, that are untelligible to any but theologists themselves; nay not even by them incontrovertibly; for otherwise how should they differ so much in their illustrations of them. However, I have no inclination to be led into a debate with you, Duncan, on a subject where you are so much my superior. But you will excuse me in committing the Confession of Faith to memory; at my age it is painful to apply to a thing as to a task. Duncan acknowledged the truth of this, and was disposed to excuse him; but recommended him to read the sermons of the reverend John Dick, and Saunders M`Alpin.CHAP CHAP. III. Having travelled this day without any remarkable occurence, and puting up at an inn in the evening, Duncan had taken care of the horse, in having him well rubbed down, and having seen his oats given him, and the rack well filled with hay. A gentlemen had also that evening put up at the inn, and whose servant had been engaged at the same time with Duncan, in taking care of his respective master's horse. This valet, whether from reading Thomas Paine's Age of Reason, which had been published about this time, or to the sceptical conversation of some one in his way, was far from being orthodox in his notions of religion; or rather was sceptical with regard to religion altogether; and had not been accustomed to the strictest propriety in the choice of his expressions; which became apparent, in a short time, from his use of suppletives that are common with pro- B 2 profane men, when they would enforce what they have asserted; or when prompted by passion, they are carried beyond the bounds of decorum, in imprecations on themselves or the incidental cause of their injury. Whether the horse had not maintained a proper position in currying him, or that the valet thought he did not, is uncertain; but so it was, that in the course of his labour he broke out into occasional sallies of ill humour; or perhaps, from mere habit, and without any cause at all, he began to damn the soul of the beast. Duncan could not avoid taking notice of it, and reprimanding him for his profanity. The other gave him no other thanks than to damn his soul also; which language began to raise the blood of Duncan; but he repressed his resentment for the present, and was silent until they both came to sit down to supper in the kitchen of the public house, the gentlemen above having already supped; when Roderick, for that was the name of the valet, began to eat, not having first said grace. At this Duncan losing all patience, broke out upon him. Sirrah, said he, I could make an excuse for your damning the soul o' your beast; because I dinna believe he has a soul, and in that cafe case ye were doing nothing mare than making use o' a bad expression; but ha' ye na mare decency, than to fall to your meat without asking a blessing on what is set before you; more than your horse i' the stable, when he falls to his oats? what could ye expect frae a dumb beast? but with ane o' the shape o' a Christian creature, it favours o' infidelity. Ha' ye na sense o' religion? Did ye never see the Confession o' Faith; or the Larger or Shorter Catechism? Are ye na afraid, the devil will get power o'er you, and make ye hang yoursel. Hang the devil, said Roderick. I am not afraid of the devil; I could kick him, and cuff him, and play hell with him. Guid deliver us! what blasphemy, said Duncan; I am afraid young man, ye may get a trial o't, you'l see then wha o' ye will be uppermost. I'll lay my lug for it, ye dinna stand him twa shakes, for a sae stout as ye are. Ye had better seek the Lord, and be out o' the reach o' Satan. I never saw any greater devil than myself, said Roderick; nor do I believe there is any, I wish I saw this Satan of yours; I would take a knock with him; I would bite, and gouge him, and,— This he said jumping to his feet, ?tretching out his hands towards Duncan, and grinning at the same time. Duncan could sustain it no longer, but making his escape from the kitchen, ran to the chamber where the Captain was with the gentlemen, taking a glass after supper: Exclaiming with great vehemence, he gave them to understand that the muckle deel himsel was in the house below stairs. I did na just see his horns, and his cloven foot, said he; but I ken him right weel by his way o' talking, when he was i' the stable wie the gentleman's horse, rubbing him down, he cursed, and swear'd like a devil; and when he came to sipper, he could na bide the blessing, but when I spake o' grace, he brake out into profane language; and at last fairly acknowledged that he was the deel himsel. Guid guide us, that we should hae the devil among us! I wad na be astonished if he has the kitchen aff in a flame o' fire, before we gae to bed yet. I hae Satan's invisible kingdom discovered wi' me, in my bags. It gies great account o' thesethings. The like happened at Drumalawrig ance before; and the guid folk had a great deal o' wark to get the muckle thief out o' their sight again. The Captain and gentleman were at a loss to to understand this rhapsody; and could only in general collect from it, that he conceived himself to have seen the devil. Where is this devil? said the Captain. Can ye shew him to us, Duncan? I can soon do that, said Duncan. I left him i' the kitchen at his meat; but I trow he does na eat muckle. It is a' a pretence, to pass for one o' us. But gin ye sing a psalm, or pronounce a verse o' the Bible, or gae about prayer, I sall warrant ye sall soon see him in his proper figure, wi' his horns and his cloven foot girnning at ye, just as he had come out o' hell about an hour ago. Let us see him, Duncan, said the Captain, and examine into these circumstances. The Captain and the gentleman had supposed that some wag, amongst the servants of the public house, had been attempting to amuse himself with the credulity of Duncan, having discovered him to be of a superstitious cast of mind; and that with some kind of vizor to the face, and uncouth dress to the person, he had assumed a frightful form, and imposed upon him the idea of a demon. Under this impression they went forward, Duncan with fear and trembling, lurking behind, and eyeing ing carefully the scene as they approached. Entering the kitchen, Duncan started, and exclaimed, The Lord deliver us! there he is, eating at his meat, as if he was a creature above ground, though ye may all see that he has the physiognomy of Belzebub. Of whom do you speak, said the Captain? of that muckle chiel there, said Duncan, i' the blue jacket, and the lang breeks;—(it was a pair of overalls);— that Satan-luking fallow, continued he, wha puts the bread in his mouth, and sits wi' his backside on a stool, as if he were ane o' oursels; and had na been i' the bottomless pit these twelve months. But gin ye speak till him, I sall warrant ye sal soon hear him talk the dialect of hell, and curse and swear like a fiend, and girn like the deel himsel; and shew his cloven foot very soon, tak my word for't. Why that is my servant, said the gentleman. Ay, ay, said Duncan, I dinna doubt that; he may hae passed himsel for your servant. But that does na hinder him to be the de'el. Dinna ye hear what the apostle says, “he can transform himself into an angel o' light.” It canna be a great trouble then to take the shape o' a waiting man, man, and sit before a pair o' saddle bags. If ye read Satan's invisible kingdom discovered, which I hae in my portmantles, ye sal find that the devil can make himself a minister, and gae into the pulpit, and conduct himself very weel, aye'till it comes to the prayer, and then off he gaes thro' the window, or takes the gavel o' the house wie him. It happened once at Linlithgo, that he tuke the shape o' a guid auld man, the reverend doctor Bunnetin, and undertook to preach the action sermon at a sacrament; but gaed awa in a flight o' fire, just as he came to gie out the text. Ah, sirrah, said he, addressing himself to Roderick, are ye there yet? ye think because the folk here in America dinna ken ye, no ha'ing Satan's invisible world discovered among their printed bukes, that for that reason, I wad na ken ye. I ken ye weel enough, auld Reeky. Gae back, to Scotland, and take the shape o' muckle dogs there, whare there are guid foks that dinna sear ye; and no come o'er the burn till America, where the gospel is na yet planted, and there is na need for ye. What have you been doing to this man, said the gentleman to Roderick, that he has conceived you to be the devil.No. Nothing more said the valet, than that when we sat down to eat he insisted on saying prayers first, and talked like a fool about religion. I was hungry, and did not like to wait for prayers. He talked about the deel. I told him I was the devil myself. He took me to be in earnest, I suppose; that is all. Aye, and ye are the deel, said Duncan. Put out your foot here, and let us see if it hae a cloven place i' the middle o't, or be like a christian's foot; or try if ye can stand till I say the Lord's prayer; though I wad na wish to say it, as I dinna ken but ye wad take the man's house wi' ye, and leave the Captain, and this gentleman without a chamber to gae to bed in. PshaDuncan, said the Captain; how can such ideas come into your brain? I see nothing, but the gentleman's servant. It is the prejudice of your education, to suppose that the devil can take the shape of men, or tangible substance; at least that he can eat food, and converse with a human voice, You will come by and bye to have a better sense of things. In the mean time we must excuse your revereis, as you are but a late emigrant. This valet may be indiscreet, or as you would say, profane, in his expre??sions; a thing of which I will venture to say this gentleman, whose waiting man he is, does by no means approve. Nevertheless, I cannot think he is Apolyon, or Belzebub, or Satan, or the great arch devil of the infernal regions I do not even believe that he is one of your inferior devils, that has assumed the shape and function of a valet, and has sat down here to eat his supper in the kitchen. I am not one one of those, said the gentleman, that approve of profane language, or the undervaluing the religious ceremonies of a conscientious, though weak man; but it would appear to me that this is but an affair of humour on the part of my valet, who by the by is but hired with me as a waiting man, and I have no controul over him, farther than to dismiss him for improper conduct. He is a merry fellow; but I have always found him faithful, and of good temper; so that I will venture to say, that if Duncan, for that I understand is the name of this North Briton, will take supper, and go to bed with him, he will receive no injury whatever. I wad na take the whole town o' Perth, to sit down wie him, said Duncan; nor a' the kingdom of Scotland to sleep wie him ae Vol. IV. C ae night. I should expect nothing else but to be i' the lake o' brimstane before the morning. I will be damn'd said Roderick, if I do you any damage. I am no devil more than yourself. It was to get quit of your long prayers before victuals, that led me to talk as I have done. Do you hear him, said Duncan? would any body but the deel, acknowledge himself willing to be dam'd, or talk about it in sae light a manner. He confirms by ae breath, what he denies by the other. He is the deel, as sure as ever Mitchel Scot was in Scotland, or if he is na the deel; he is as bad as the deel, and it gaes against the grain wi' me to hae ony communication wi' him. Let him gae to hell for me by himself. He sal not hae my company. I wad na trust but that he wad hae an hundred witches here about the house, before the morning, and put every one o' us on a broomstick to ride along wi' him, taking the taps aff the trees, and dinging floon houses, as he gaes along; the auld woman turning themselves into cats, as they like, or taking the shapes o' hares, or swimming o'er rivers in their egg-shells. The Captain finding that it was in vain to to attempt by direct means to overcome the force of prejudice, changed his language, and affected to suppose that the valet might be the devil, and proposed to examine the extremity of both limbs, to see whether he had a cloven foot. The valet, summitting to the jest, agreed to be examined. His boots and stockings therefore being stripped off, his feet were examined, and no sissure appeared more than in a common foot. Now, said the Captain, if he can stand the recital of a prayer, will you not acknowledge that he may be a human person. Ay, if 'twere a minister, said Duncan; but I dinna ken, if the prayer o' a layman, can affect him much. But it does na matter muckle, whether he is the devil or not; he is amaist as bad as the devil, as you may distinguish by his conversation, and I dinna care to ha muckle more to do wie him. That is, devil or no devil, said the Captain, you will neither eat nor sleep with him. Just the short and the lang o' it, said Duncan. I will take a bit o' bread and beef in my hand, and creep into some nuke by mysel, if it should be i' the stable with the horses, rather than wie this wicked crea creature, that if he is not Satan, has a great resemblance o' him. With this the Captain and the gentlemen, left them to themselves, and returned to the chamber. CHAP. IV. IN the morning it appeared that Duncan had sat up the greater part of the night, with a candle burning by him in the kitchen, until near day-light; when overcome with sleep he had reclined upon a bench, until the gentleman and his valet had departed, and the Captain had got up, which was about an hour after sunrise. Having breakfasted, which was about 9 o'clock, they set out upon their travels, conversing as they went along upon subjects that occurred. The first topic was a comparison of Scotland with this country; in what particulars each had the advantage of the other. Duncan gave a decided preference in all things to the trans-Atlantic region; and found nothing on this con continent that could encounter the smallest competition. I should presume, said the Captain, we have more timber in this country than in yours. You may have more, but not half sae guid, said Duncan. Our fir, is far better than the oak that ye find here. I will allow you the advantage in one particular, said the Captain; you are more closely settled, and the soil of course must be under a more general cultivation. Aye, but that is nathing, said Duncan; it is settled wi' a better stock o' people; and we hae dukes and lairds amang us; no as it is here, where ye may gae a day's journey, and no hear of a piper at a great house, or see a castle; but a' the folks, and their habitations, luking just for a' the warld like our cotters in Scotland. But, said the Captain, what do you think of the works of nature here, the sun and moon for instance? The sun is a very guid sun, said Duncan; but he has o'er muckle heat in the middle of the day. I wad like him better if he wad draw in a little of it at this season, and let it out i' the winter, when we sal hae more need o' it. But as to the moon, Duncan, said the Captain, you have seen it since you came in; do you C 2 you think it is as large as the moon in Scotland? I dinna ken, quoth Duncan, but it is amaist as large; but it changes far aftener, and it is no sae lang at the full as it is in our kintry. But what think you of the stars, Duncan; you have taken notice of them, I presume, in this hemisphere. The stars dinna differ muckle frae the stars at hame, quoth Duncan; save that there are not sae many o' them. Wi' us, the firmament is a' clad wi' them, like brass buttons; they light it up just like candles. But here they luke blaite, and hae a watery appearance in the night, as if they had got the fever and ague o' the climate, and were sickly, and had na strength to put forth their fire. I tell you, captain, there is nothing here equal to what it is in Scotland. How could you expect it; this is but a young kintra. It will be a lang time before it comes to sik perfection as wi' us; and I dinna ken if it ever does. How comes it to pass, Duncan, said the Captain that the devil chuses the women of your country, in preference to any other, to make witches of? For it would seem to be the case; as I have heard more of of Scotch witches, than of English or American. I can gie ye a good reason for that, said Duncan. The deel kens weel enough where to find out the best materials. The English women are no worth making witches of; they could do him little guid when he had them. Ane Scotch witch is worth a dozen English, or American. They can loup farther, and sink a ship in half the time. The Captain having made this experiment of the national partiality of Duncan, was satisfied; and turned the conversation to another subject.CHAP CHAP. V. I Shall not stop to record the minute incidents that took place in the course of this day's travel; or that of the two following days; or relate the particulars of the conversation of the Captain with Duncan, or of Duncan with any other person. What I have related, was chiefly with a view to give some idea of the new valet's character and manners. I think it was the fourth day after leaving the city, that the Captain casting up his eyes at a place where there was a considerable length of straightroad before him, saw a person trudging on foot, who by his make and gait, appeared to him to resemthe new revenue officer, the quondam bog-trotter. Duncan, said the Captain, if that man was not on foot, that is before us, I should take him for Teague O'Regan, the waiting man that was in my service, and who gave place to you; having obtained a a commission in the revenue, and become an excise officer. But as I had equipped him with a horse, it is not probable that he could be without one already, and have taken to his trotters, after being advanced to be a limb of the government. It would be a degradation to the dignity of office. I dinna think, quoth Duncan, there is muckle dignity in the office. What is he but a gauger? that is of na more estimation in our kintra than a hangman. There is na ane that can live in an honest way without it, will take the commission. Duncan, said the Captain, it is not so in this country, where the government is a republic; and all taxes being laid by people, the collection of every species is a sacred duty, and equally honourable. Honour! quoth Duncan. Do you talk of honour in a gauger? If that be the way of thinking in this kintra, I wish it were back in Scotland. Every thing seems to be orsa versa here; the wrang side uppermost. I am but a simple waiting man to a gentlemen like yoursel, and I wad na take the office o' gauger upon me, for a' Philadelphia, which is amaist as big as Perth. By this time they were within a small dif distance of the traveller, whom the Captain reconnoitering more perfectly, discovered absolutely to be Teague. The revenue officer, turning round, he recognized the Captain, and accosted him: “By my shoul, and there he is, his honour himself; the Captain, and a new sharvant that he has trotting on foot, as I myself used to do.” And as you seem to do yet, Teague, said the Captain. What is become of the horse I furnished you? Has he been stolen, or has he strayed away from some pasture in the course of your progress? By my shoul, said the officer, neither the one nor the oder of dese happened; but I met wid a good affer on de road, and I took it. I swaped him for a watch dat I have in my pocket here. Bless de sweet little shoul of it: It tells de hour of de day, and what time of de clock it is, slapeing or waking; and in de night time you have but just to look at the face of it, and de sweet pretty figures dat are dare, and you will know how long it is before the morning come. Not like de dumb beast, that could not answer you a word in the night nor in the day; but hold his tongue like a shape, and say nothing; while dis little watch, as de call it, can speak like a Christian creature, and keep keep company along de road like a living person. It was for dat reason dat I took it from a country man dat I met wid last night at the tavern; and am now going on by myself, and have no horse to take care of, and plague me on de road, and give me falls over his tail, and over his mane, up hill and down hill, so dat I almost broke my neck, and thought it safest to ride upon my foot. Dat is truth, master Captain. But who is dis son of a whore dat you have wid you trotting in my place? Does he take good care of your creature at night, and clean your boots. I would be after bidding him smell dis cudgel here dat I walk wid, if he neglect a good master, as your honour is. The blood of Duncan was up at the idea of being cudgelled by an excise officer; and stepping up to Teague he lifted a cudgel on his part. “Ye cudgel me, sirrah! said the Caledonian. If it was na for his honour's presence, I wad lay this rung on your hurdies; or gie ye a rap upon the crown; to talk sik language to your betters. I should make ye ken what it is to raise the blood of a Scotchman. You ca' yourself a revenue officer. But what is that but a guager? which is the next to a hang hangman in our kintra. Captain, will ye stand by and see fair play, till I gie him his paikes for his impertinence. My lug for it, I sal make this rung rattle about the bones o' his head to some tune. With that Duncan was making his advance, having raised his cudgel, and puting himself in the attitude of a person accustomed to the back sword; which Teague on the other hand observing, accosted him with softer words; not disposed to risk an engagement with an unknown adversary. Love your shoul, said he, if I was after affronting you more than his honour my master; burn me, if I don't love you, just because you are my master's sharvant, and takes care of his baste. I was only jokeing. It is just the way I would spake to my own dear cousin Dermot, if he were here; for in Ireland we always spake backwards. Put up your stick, dear honey, I am sure the Captain knows that I was always good-natured, and not given to quarrels; though I could fight a good stick too upon a pinch; but it never came into my head to wrangle with my master's sharvant, especially such a tight good looking fellow as yourshelf, dat has a good shelalah in your hand hand, and is fitter to beat than to be beaten, by shaint Patrick. Duncan, said the Captain, you have heard the explanation of the hasty words the revenue officer at first used; and it would seem to me, that, consistently with the reputation of courage, and good breeding both, you ought to be satisfied. I dinna ken, quoth Duncan; it was a vera great provocation to talk o' cudgeling; and it may be the custom o' a friendly salutation in Ireland, but no in our kintra. While I ha a drop o' the blood o' St. Andrew in me, I wad na gae up to sik civilities. Said the Captain, as far as I can have understood, St. Patrick and St. Andrew were cousins, and you his descendants or disciples ought to be on terms of amity. St. Andrew a cousin to St. Patrick! said Duncan. I canna acknowledge that, Captain. St. Andrew was a guid Protestant, and a Covenanter, but St. Patrick was a Papist, o' the kirk o' Rome; and did na keep the second commandment, but worshipped graven images, and pictures o' saints; and tuke the sacrament wie a wafer. I shall never gie up that, Captain, that St. Patrick was o' kin to St. Andrew. They Vol. IV. D They might be i' the ministry at the same time; but there is a great difference in their doctrine. Did ye e'er ready any o' the works o' John Knox, Captain? Dinna ye ken, that the church of Rome is the whore o' Babylon? If ye had lived in the time o' the persecution, ye wad na hae compared a Scotch saint wie a Irish priest. Said the Captain, I have no particular acquaintance with the distinguishing renets of the two Evangelists; nor do I know any thing of them, save just to have understood that the one had planted Christianity in Scotland and the other in Ireland. But this is not a point so material to us individually, as that we cultivate peace, and have no difference. I must therefore enjoin it on you, Duncan, that you drop your stick, and keep the peace towards the revenue officer on the high way, that he may not be delayed in going forward to enter on the functions of his office. Said Duncan, Since your honour says the word, I shall lay down my stick; for I ken the law better than to stand out against the civil authority. But Teague, said the Captain, how can you distinguish the figures of your watch, so as to tell the hours of the day; you that do do not understand figures? By my shoul, said Teague, and I never tought of dat. Will not the figures spake for demselves, when I look at dem. I am sure, I saw the son of a whore dat I got her from, look at her, and tell the hour o' de day, like a pracher at his books; and I am sure and certain, dat such an ill-luking teef as he was, could neither read nor write. But by my shoul, if dat is de way, dat I have to read de marks myself, I will swap her back for a horse or a cow, on de road; or for something else, dat will plase your honour better; so dere is no harm done, plase your honour, while we are in a christian country, and can meet wad good paple to spake to, and take a watch or a colt off our hands, when we mane to part wid it, plase your honour. Such was the conversation at the first interview of the Captain's family, to use a military stile; and may be considered as a sample of that which took place in the sequel of this day's travel, as they proceeded together until noon; when they came to dine at a public house, and umbrage was taken by Duncan, because the Captain had permitted Teague to sit at table with himself; which he did in respect to to the office which he held, and in order to support its dignity. Captain, said Duncan, coming to the hall door, and looking in, d'ye permit an excise officer to sit at the table wie your honour. For sik profanation I never heard o' in a' my born days; if it were in Scotland, it wad cause a sight to the whole neighbourhood. Does your honour ken that he is an excise officer? Duncan, said the Captain, it is a principle of good citizenship, especially in a republican government, to pay respect to the laws, and maintain the honour of its officers. It is for this reason, that I make it a point to honour one who was lately my bog-trotter; not that I discern in him any remarkable improvement in talents or manners; but simply because the government has discovered something; and has seen fit to give him a commission in the revenue. Who knows but it may be your own fortune, at no distant day to obtain an office, and will you not think it reasonable then, that it should be forgotten that you were once in the capacity of a waiting man; and that you should receive the respect and the precedence due to your new dignity? it is not with us as in monarchies, where the advance is gradual dual in most cases; though even there, an individual through the favour of the prince, or of the queen, or of a lady or gentleman of the court, may have a sudden promotion: but in a free state, what hinders that the lowest of the people should be taken up, and made magistrates, or put into commissions in the revenue? I must insist, Duncan, that you retire to the kitchen, and take your dinner, and make no disturbance in the house at this time; you will come to understand better the nature of offices in these commonwealths in due time. Duncan retired; but in soliloquy expressing his chagrin, at the strange reversion of affairs in America, from what they were in Scotland; and his mortification at finding himself in the service of a master, that could degrade himself by dining with an excise officer. Teague, on the other hand, though he was silent in the hearing of Duncan, broke out as soon as he had shut the door; Captain, said he, plase your honour, where did you pick up dat teef-luking son o'd a whore, dat has no more manners, dan a shape-stealer in Ireland; or a merchant dat sells yarn at a fair. By saint Patrick, if your honour had given me leave in de road D 2 road, I would have knocked his teet down his troat; and if your honour will excuse de table, I will go out and take him by de troat, and make him talk to himself like a frog in de wet swamps; de son of a whore, to spake to your honour wid a brogue upon his tongue, in such words as defe. By the brogue, Teague meant the Scottish dialect, which Duncan used. Teague, said the Captain, the prejudices of education must be tolerated, until time and experience of the world, has lessened or removed them. He is an honest fellow, and I have more confidence in him, than I ever had in you, though his talents have not appeared equal; at least if I am to judge from the estimate made of you, by these who have a better right to judge than I have. However, I am unwilling to have any disturbance between you, and therefore, must insist that you leave him to the reprimands which I myself have occasionally given him, and shall continue to give him, until he attains a better knowledge of the nature of things in this new hemisphere, so different from those to which he has been accustomed. This put an end to any altercation between tween the two, the revenue officer and the waiting man, for the remaining part of that day, as they trudged together, until they came to the inn at night, and having supped, were about to go to bed. It was what in some places is called an Ordinary; that is, an indifferent tavern, of but mean accommodations. The house was small, and there was but two beds for the reception of strangers; one of these so indifferent, as to appear fit only for the servant of a gentleman, who might happen to travel the road, though large enough to contain two, or three persons. What it wanted in quality of neatness, and perhaps cleanliness, was made up in dimensions. This bed therefore seemed naturally to invite the reception of two of the company. Teague, said the Captain, when about to go to bed, I think Duncan and you, being the younger men, may pig in together in that large bed, and leave the other to me who am an older man, and am apt to tumble and toss a little, from weariness in my ride; and may perhaps disturb you in your sleep. Guid deliver me, said Duncan, frae sik a profanation o' the name o' Ferguson, as to sleep wi' an excise officer. I am am na o' a great family, but I am come o' a guid family; and it shall never be said that I came to America to disgrace my lineage, by sik contact as that. Gae to bed wi' an excise officer! I wad sooner gae to bed out o' doors; or i' the stable amang the horses. The revenue officer was affronted at this; and gave way to his indignation. The devil burn me, said he, if I will be after slapeing wid you, you son of a whore, you teef luking vagabon; wid de itch upon your back; I am sure all your country has de itch; and keep scratching and scratching, as if de ware in hell, and could get brimstone for noting; you son o'd a whore. The youke! said Duncan. Do you impeach me wi' the youke? You impatche yourself, said the revenue officer. Did not I see you scratching as you came along de road; and do you tink, you teef, dat I with to get de leprosy, or de scurvy, and have to sleep in a bag o' brimstone two or tree weeks, before I be fit to travel wid his honour the Captain again? The deel damn me, said Duncan, if I can bear that. What, swear, Duncan? said the Captain, or curse rather; you that are a Covenanter, and have religious books in your wallet, the Confession of Faith and the Catechisms! How can I help it, man, said Duncan. The deel rive his saul, but I man be at him. Duncan had by this time seized his walking staff, and put himself in an attitude to attack his adversary, who on the other hand had, instinctively, ensconced himself behind the Captain, and opposed him as a rampart to the fury of the Scot. Duncan, said the Captain, you are in the wrong on this occasion, you gave the asfront, and ought to excuse the revenue officer for what he has said, which, by the bye, was not justifiable, on any other ground but that of provocation. For national reflections are at all times reprehensible. But in order to compose this matter, and that we may have no further disturbance, I will take the large, though more humble bed my self, and sleep with the excise officer, for the reputation of the government who has thought proper to appoint him to this trust. The deel take me if ye shall do that, Captain, said Duncan; I wad rather take the the stain upon mysel, than let my liege be disgraced; for it wad come a' to the same thing in the end, that I had been the waiting man o' ane that had been the bed fellow o'a gauger. O! guid keep us, how that would found in Scotland. What wad my relation Willy Ferguson, that is professor i' the high college o' E'nburgh, say to that? But rather than your honour shou'd take the stain upon you, I sal put up wie it for a night; though if the landlady has a pickle strae, and a blanket, I wad rather lie by the fire side, than contaminate mysel, beding wi' sik a bog-trotting loon as he is, that wad gae into sik an office for the sake o' filthy lucre, and to make a living; when there are many honest means to get a support other ways. The landlady gave it to be understood that she could furnish him with a bag of straw and a blanket. This adjusted the difficulty, and saved the delicacy of the Scotchman, and embarrassment of the Captain, in keeping peace between the bog-trotters; as in reality they both were, though the one had obtained a commission, and the other remained a private person.CHAP CHAP. VI. IN the course of the three following days, during which the Captain and the two bog trotters, journeyed together, a great deal of ill will shewed itself between the under?trappers. By the bye, I ask pardon, before I go farther, of the government, for thus confounding the revenue officer with the present waiting man; but I aver, that it is not owing to any disrespect of the government, though it may have that appearance; but is to be resolved simply into the force of habit which I acquired in designating O'Regan in the early part of this narrative, before he was advanced to office; and since that, to the impression made upon my mind, occasionally by his conduct, which has not intirely corresponded with the dignity of the commission. When instances occur of this nature, I fall involuntarily into the use of the former epithet, which reflection, doubtless, would teach teach me to discard. This is my apology; and if it should be attributed to any secret grudge, or dislike of public measures, or persons at the head of our affairs, it will be a great injustice. But, as I was saying, in the course of the following days, much bickering took place between the Hibernian and the Scotchman; or as I might otherwise express myself, between the son of St. Andrew, and St. Patrick. The Scot thought the Hibernian defective in grace and manners; both because he did not ask a blessing to his food, and because he took the liberty to eat with the Captain, and to converse with him as on equal terms. Indeed it was the only fault he found with the Captain himself, that he did not say grace to meat, and that he admitted the gauger to this enjoyment of equality. He did not enter fully into the necessary policy of observing the forms of respect to officers of government, merely for the sake of the authority, and as a compliment to the laws themselves. Nor was his knowledge of the human mind, and the modes of acting, sufficient to inform him, that the saying grace at victuals is a matter of form, more than of faith; and that for this reason, some christian fects sects, particularly the people called Quakers, omit it altogether. The Hibernian would sometimes beat off, to use a nautical phrase, and disarm his adversary by expressions of benevolence, as “Love your shoul,” &amp;c.; sometimes he would prepare for battle, and be disposed to defend himself; on which occasions it behoved the Captain to interfere, and break off the contest. The Captain, at length, weary of this trouble, thought of the expedient of dismissing the revenue officer a day or two a head, in order that he might be apart from the other bog trotter. This being done, with exhortation that he would go lorward speedily, and open an office in the district, the Captain propofed to remain a day at the public house where he then was, in order to give the revenue officer the advantage of the start I have mentioned. In the mean time, hearing of a cave in the neighbourhood, which was thought to be a great curiosity, he took the opportunity of visiting it. The guide led them to it, I mean the Captain and his waiting man, in about an hour's walk from the public house. It was on the bank of a small river; the mouth of the cave opening to the bank Vol. IV. E bank. A small stream issued from the cave, and fell into the river, with a fall of a few feet over a rock, rendered smooth by the current of the water. Above this, was a shade of spreading beech, with thick foliage, and beneath, towards the strand of the river, was a gradual descent with washed pebbles, and a clear filtrating sand. Hard by the fall of this water, and on the strand of the river, the attention of the Captain was attached by certain rude sculptures, observable on a flat rock; and also by others on a perpendicular one, that composed a part of the bank. There was the figure of the tarapin, the bear, the turkey, &amp;c. It was a subject of reflection with the Captain, whether these impressions had been made by the animals themselves, while the rock had been in a plastic state, and before it had hardened from clay into stone; or whether it was the work of the savages, before the Europeans had possession of the country. He lamented that he had not a philosopher at hand, to determine this. On the bank above, and toward the mouth of the cave, were a number of petrefactions to be found; the water that ran here, appearing hence to have a petrifying quality. The Captain considering deri these, was thinking with himself how good a school this would have been for Teague, had he been admitted a member of the Philosophical Society, as had been proposed at an early period. The mouth of the cave, was of a height and width to receive a man walking upright, and without constraint on his entrance; after a passage of a few yards, lined with the solid rocks, it opened into an apartment of about eighteen feet cube. The oozing from above formed the stalactites, and would probably in the course of a century or two, fill up this chamber altogether, unless by digging above, the course of the water could be diverted from the roof, and carried off by a conduit on a solid part of the mountain. The floor of the chamber had been raised by the pretrifaction of the water; as appeared from the inequality of surface, formed by the stalactites, and from the testimony of the guide, who remembered the time, not more than fifteen years ago, when the descent to this apartment, was a step of at least a foot from the level of the entrance. Passing on a few yards more, they descended a step, and came to a second apratment, of a greater extent, and of not less than an hundred feet to the level vault. Here was a vast bed of human skeletons petrified, but distinguishable by their forms. No doubt it had been a repository of savage chiefs, whose bodies, converted into stone by the virtue of this water, were preserved more durably than the mummies of Egypt. The dimensions of some of the skeletons bespoke them giants; that of one measured eight feet, wanting an inch. Duncan, said the Captain, I doubt much whether there have been larger giants in Scotland. Aye have there, half as large again, said Duncan; from the stones that are put up in some castles, there must have been men at least eighteen or twenty feet in height. What can have become of this breed? said the Captain. They have fought wi' ane another, 'til they are a' dead, said Duncan. This was the easiest way of accounting for the loss. There was an ascent of a step or two to the next apartment, which was of an oval form, the conjugate diameter of which was about thirty feet, and the transverse twenty five. There were the bows and arrows, all petrified, that these warriors had used in life. The water descended not in drops, but through the fine pores of the rock rock in a gentle dew, and with an impression of extreme cold, so as to endanger life, and probably convert the human body into stone in a very short space of time. The guide thought it not advisable to remain long, and Duncan was anxious to return; the forms of the dead in the chamber behind him leading him to apprehend, that some of their shades might come after them, to enquire the occasion of their visit. Regaining the entrance of the cave, and emerging into light, I mean the light of day, for they had entered with torches, they left the place, and returned to the tavern. The day following, they paid another visit to the cave, and observed in the chamber of bows and arrows, a pool of limpid water, into which looking, they discovered arrow heads, and hatchets of stone innumerable. They took out, and brought away some of them. These had no doubt been first formed in wood, and then put in this water to petrify, and become fit for use. Thus we easily account for the formation of such implements; whereas the idea of being formed out of a stone, in the first instance, by the dint of human labour, and with no other instruments than E 2 than stone itself, involves great difficulty. This discovery, the Captain, I presume, lost no time in communicating to the Philosophical Society, as will in due time appear, from a publication of their transactions. Near the entrance, and on the right, was the passage to what is called the petrified grove. This, on their return they entered, and in about thirty steps, found themselves in a spacious square, which appeared to have been once the surface of the earth: For here was trees in their natural position, with wasps nests on them, all petrified; and buffaloes standing under, in their proper form, but as hard as adament. A bleak wind, with a petrifying dew, had arrested them in life, and fixed them to the spot; while the mountain in a series of ages, had grown over them. That which struck the Captain most, was an Indian man reduced to stone, with a bundle of peltry on his back. If the virtuosi of Italy, could have access to this vault, there would be danger of them robbing it of some of these figures, in order to compare with the statues that have been made by hands. When this cave shall have gained due celebrity, there is is no qestion, but that attempts of this nature will be made. I submit therefore, whether it would not be adviseable for the connoisseurs of America, to apply to the legislature of the state, where the cave is, to prevent such exportation. The Captain leaving this place, took nothing with him but the skin of a wild cat, which hung upon a stone peg in the side of the grotto, and which he broke off, by giving it a sudden jerk as he turned round. Duncan took a petrified turtle, which he thought resembled a highland bonnet, and said he would scrape it out, and send it for a curiosity to Perth.CHAP CHAP. VII. Containing Observations. It may be observed, that as I advance in my book, I make fewer chapters, by way of commentary, and occupy myself chiefly with the narrative. It is the characteristic of old age, and may be decorous towards the conclusion of the work. Nevertheless, I shall arrest myself here a little, to reflect on one particular of the discoveries of the Captain; the sculpture on the rocks, which appeared to be the labour of the aborigness of this country. I have not seen these sculptures, for I have not had an opportunity of visting this cave; but I have seen similiar sculptures, in abundance, on the west of the Allegany mountains. I recollect at an early period to have heard it said, that Ferdinando Soto, had been on the Ohio waters, and as high as the mouth of the great Kenaway; and to have have heard it given as a proof of this, that in a particular place near the mouth of that river, the imperial eagle was to be seen engraven on a rock; the eagle which was the ensign of the Spanish monarchy, under Charles V, also emperor of Germany, and the successor of the Cæsars. It was added, on the same ground, that the vestiges of fortifications discoverable in this country, were the remains of Spanish works, and encamping grounds, under Soto. I had understood, that the great Franklin had adopted this hypothesis with regard to these forts, from the sculpture of the eagle. In the winter of the year 1787, I had the happiness to converse with that sage, and amongst a number of questions, which I had the curiosity, and perhaps impertinence, to ask, I put this, with regard to the Kenaway sculpture, and the theory of the vestiges of forts in the western country. I found his ideas to be as I had been informed, and have stated. I was then in Philadelphia. In the fall of this year, having returned to the western country, a surveyor who had been engaged in surveying lands on the Kenaway, being in my office on some business, it occurred to me to interrogate him him on the subject of the sculpture. He had seen the engraving, of what was thought to be the eagle, but called it a Turkey; which word no sooner strnck my ear, than all the hypothesis of the holy Roman eagle, and Ferdinando Soto, fell to the ground. It is a turkey, thought I, which the fancy of the virtuoso and antiquarian, has converted into the king of birds. Conversing, with the surveyor, he gave me an account more minutely of this, and other figures cut upon the rock, viz. the turkey with its wings spread, as if just alighting; the deer with his branching horns; and the savage himself, with a large head and long limbs, rudely cut. He added, that he had heard from a hunter whom he well knew, that there was a rock with similar engravings on Cheat river, a small distance above where it falls into the Monongahela; and promised to bring this hunter to give me a description. About a month afterwards, the surveyor brought the hunter to me, who appeared to have been observant, and to be intelligent. He had seen the rocks near the mouth of Cheat river. The following is the memorandum that I took from him: The “The turkey appears to have alighted at the lower part of the rock, and ran up to the top. You see the track, which it leaves; the stretched back, and the body thrown forward, as between flying and running. There is the figure of a man, with a large head, and horns, and a thin skeleton-like body. There are deer tracks well cut. This rock stands on a bend of the river; and the figures on the lower end, which projects most, are defaced by the water, which rises to this height in the time of floods. There is a horse track. This is the only thing that I think remarkable, if it is a horse track; for, as I do not know that there were any horses here, before the European settlements, it would argue that this engraving had been done since, and by the natives who have come from the Chesapeek, and had seen horses. The settlement made by Captain Smith at the mouth of James river, Virginia, was I believe the earliest made, contiguous to this country.” This hunter gave me to understand, that he had seen a rock, sculptured in like manner on the Kenaway, about eighty miles from its mouth; that is nearly in a line line directly west from the rocks on Cheat river. Having been led into the way of enquiring on this subject, I have found that these engravings are very common throughout the whole western country; that they are discernible all along the Ohio, at low water especially, when the horizontal rocks are left bare; that they are found on the margins of the smaller streams also. I had heard of one of these on the Monongehela, about forty miles above Pittsburgh, and in the summer of 1793, crossing the country near that place, I spent a part of a day, in going out of my course to observe it. The sculptures were of the same kind, and answer the description before given of those elsewhere. The figures on this are, a bear rudely or rather clumsily cut; a hawk flying with a snake in its beak; the moon and the seven stars; a racoon; a human arm, and human feet, well done; a buck with branching horns; the turkey; and a number others. I want no other proof that these sculptures were by the natives, than the form of the feet, which are unquestionably Indian. The narrowness, and smallness of the heel evinces it. It might also be induced as a pre presumption, that there are the vestiges of a sortification, such as has been mentioned, just above on the hill. For it is reasonable to suppose, that these works of leisure and taste, were most likely to be pursued in the neighbourhood of such a work. But what has been at all times conclusive to me, that these engravings are the works of the natives, is, the circumstance that no alphabetic mark of any language, or Roman or Arabic numeral, is found amongst any of these. For it is well known, that it is a thing which would occur to any European, who should amuse himself in this manner, to impress the initials at least of his name, and the digits of the year. I had put this question to the surveyor and hunter, of whom I have made mention, with regard to letters and numeral marks, and found that none had been observed by them, on the rocks which they had seen. On that ground, independent of all others, I made the deduction I have stated. I consider these sculptures, as the sirst rude esseys of the fine art of engraving; and to have been the work of savages of taste, distinguished from the common mass, by a talent to imitate in wood or stone, the Vol. IV. F the forms of things innature, and a capacity of receiving pleasure from such an application of the mental powers. Whilst a chief of genius, was waiting for the assembling of other chiefs, to hold a council; or while the warrior was waiting at a certain point for others, that were to meet him, he may have amused himself in this manner; or it may have been the means to cheat weariness, and solace the intellectual faculty, when there was no counselling in the nation, or wars to carry on. Happy savage, that could thus amuse himself, and exercise his first preeminence over animals we call Beasts. They can hunt, and devour living things for food; but where do you find a wolf, or a fishing hawk, that has any idea of these abstract pleasures, that feed the imagination? Why is it that I am proud, and value myself amongst my own species? It is because I think I possess, in some degree, the distinguishing characteristic of a man, a taste for the fine arts: a taste and characteristic too little valued in America, where a system of finance, has introduced the love of unequal wealth; destroyed the spirit of common industry; and planted that of lot lottery in the human heart; making the mass of the people gamblers; and under the idea of speculation, sthrouded engrossing and monopoly every where. It would seem, that the sculptures of which I speak, are the works of more ancient savages, than these which have lately occupied this country; these tribes not being in the habit of making any such themselves, and the figures evincing an old date, being in most places, in some degree essaced, by the water of the river, or the rain washing the rocks, on which they are engraven. They would seem to have been a more improved race, who had given way to barbarians of the north, who had over run the country. It is generally understood, by the tradition of the present Indians, and the early French writers, Charlevoix and others, that about the beginning of the present century, the Six Nations conquered this country, and expelled the former owners; and the word Ohio, is said to mean Bloody, and was the name given it from the blood shed upon its waters at that time. The sortifications of which we speak, must have also been works of defence, of that or an earlier period. From the trees grow growing upon the mound, or parapet of these, they must be some of them many hundred years old. It will strike the reflection, how was it possible for the human mind to remain so long in so low a stage of improvement, as was the casfe with these, the aborigines of this country. Perhaps the more puzzling question would be, whence the spring that could have sussicient energy to rouse from it. I shall leave this to philosophy, thought, and historical deduction. Enough has been said at present.CHAP CHAP. VIII. ON the third day renewing their journey, the conversation between the Captain and his servant turned on the character, and history of the present revenue officer, the late Teague O'Regan. The Captain gave Duncan a relation of what had happened; in the case of the attempt to draw him off to the Philosophical Society, to induce him to preach, and even to take a seat in the legislature of the United States; that had it not been for a certain Traddle, a weaver, whom they had been fortunate enough to substitute for him, the people would most undoubtedly have elected Teague, and sent him to Congress. Guid deliver us! said Duncan; do they make Parliament men o' weavers i' this kintra? In Scotland, it maun be a duke, or a laird, that can hae a seat there. This is a republic, Duncan, said the cap F 2 Captain; and the rights of man are understood, and exercised by the people. And if he could be i' the Congress, why did ye let him be a gauger? said Duncan. This is all the prejudice of education, Duncan, said the Captain. An appointment in the revenue, under the executive of the United States, ought not to have disgrace attached to it in the popular opinion; for it is a necessary, and ought to be held a sacred, duty. I dinna ken how it is, said Duncan; but I see they hae every thing tail foremost in this kintry, to what they hae in Scotland: a gauger a gentleman; and weavers in the legislature. Just at this instant, was heard by the way side, the jingling of a loom, in a small cabbin with a window towards the road. It struck Duncan to expostulate with this weaver, and to know why it was that he also did not attain a seat in some public body. Advancing to the orifice, as it might be called, he applied his mouth, and bespoke him, as he sat upon his loom, thus: Traddle, said he, giving him the same name that the Captain had given the other; why is it that ye sit here, treading these twa stecks, and playing wi' your your elbows, as ye throw the thread, when there is one o' your occupation, not far off, that is now a member of the house o' lords, or commons, in America; and is gane to the Congress o' the United States? canna ye get yoursel elected; or it is because ye dinna offer, that ye are left behind in this manner. Ye shud be striving man, while guid posts are gaeing, and no be sitting there wi' your backside on a beam. Dinna your neibours gie ya a vote. Ye shud get a chapin o' whiskey, man, and drink 'till them, and gar them vote, or, ye shoud gae out and talk politics, and mak speeches. Such was the address of Duncan, meaning nothing more than to amuse himself, with the idea of a manufacturer obtaining a seat in the legislature, and making laws instead of warping webs. But in the mean time, the wife of the mechanic, who had overheard the conversation, and was incensed at an attempt to take her husband from his business, seizing a pot stick and running out, and turning the corner of the house, laid a blow upon the posteriors of the orator; accompanying her force with reproachful words to this effect:will Will you never let the man alone, said she, to mind his business, but be putting these notions in his head. He has been once constable, and twice member of assembly; and what has he got by it, but to leave his customers at home, complaining of their work not done? It is but little good that has been got of him these three years, but going to elections, and meetings, and talking politics; and after all, what does he know of these matters? just about as much as my brown cow. A set of lounging louts, coming here and taking up his time with idle nonsense of what laws should be made, and urging him to be elected; and William Rabb's wife waiting for her coverlet this three months, and Andrew Nangle for his shirt cloth. It is enough to put a woman in a passion that has the temper of a saint, to have her man's head turned so from his own affairs, by idle vagabonds that come the way in this manner. At this, she made another effort, and springing forward, was about to impress a second blow; when Duncan retreating, and listing up his stick in his turn accosted her in these words: “Gin ye were a man, as ye are a muckle witch, I shoud be for taking ye wi' this rung across your hurdies. it Is it any affront to have it evened to your man Traddle, to gae to the senate, and to get a post i' the government, and no be knotting threads here, wi' his shuttle, like a tradesman o' Paisly? Ye vile carlin, ye maun be a witch, or a warse body, to take a stick in your hand, like a driver o' stots, and come pelmel, upon a man ahint his back, when he is na speaking till ye. Foul fa' me, but if it were na a shame to battle wi' ane o' your sex, I wad break your back with a lunder, before ye knew what ye were about. To keep this honest man here, shut up like a prisoner under ground, in a dungeon, drawing a reed till him, instead o' throwing out his arms like a Latin scholar, or a collegian, making his oration to his hearers? Are ye chained there, (turning his speech to Traddle,) that ye stay sae contentedly yoursel, man, and dinna break out, and escape srae the fangs o' this witch.” This witch! said she, (apprehending danger from a second address to the weaver,) this witch! I shall witch you to some purpose, you vagabond. With this she made a hasty step, and was nearly on the back of the Caledonian, with her pot-stick, having made a stroke at him, which be eva evaded, by taking to his heels, and retreating speedily. The Captain in the mean time had rode on, and left them to compleat their dialogue. CHAP. IX. Duncan had affected the wag on the late occasion with the manufacturer and his wife, and had like to have suffered some alloy of pain from the blows which were inflictted, or were meditated. But at the public house, in a village, a little way ahead this day, where they halted about noon, a circumstance happened which changed his view a little, and disposed him to sadness, rather than to play the wag with his neighbours on the road. While the Captain had reclined, and was asleep on a sofa, a constable had apprehended Duncan with a warrant; commanding this officer to take the prisoner before a justice of the peace, by whom it had been issued. Duncan had taken for granted, that it was the weaver's wife who had made complaint, and sent after him, on account of the threats he had made to chas- chastise her. The bustle in apprehending him, had made a noise in the porch, and awakened the Captain. Duncan, said he, what is the matter? Lord deliver me, said he, if I ken. They say I am a prisoner. The baisiff here has ta'en me wi' a warrant. It maun be that witch the weaver's wife, that has made a complaint, just because I was jesting a wee, about her husband gaeing to the legislature; and she did na take it weel, but amaist brake my back wi' her' spurtle; and now she has ga'en awa and sworn belike that I strak her; for this is the way o' these witches, that they turn states evidence, and swear for themselves against honest people. Duncan, said the Captain, this is what comes of your meddling with politics. You must undertake to say forsooth, who is qualified to be a representative of the United States; you must insist upon an industrious mechanic to relinquish his occupation; and this not from any opinion of his fitness for such appointment, or any principle of love for the public good; but merely for your pastime, and in ridicule of a republican government in this country. For though there have been instances of chusing weavers for the legislature, and and coblers, and coopers, why make a burlesque of this? Have not the people a right to make such a choice? yet because these things are not common in Scotland, it must be the subject of a laugh here. Had you been serious, there could have been no fault found; but the insult lies in your making a jest of it, which was evident from your manner, in turning aside from the highway to address a weaver through the windos of a cellar; and in an abrupt manner, to introduce an expostulation with him on the subject of election. No wonder that the termagant his wife, who did not relish the proposition, even in a serious point of view, was offended, and disposed to inflict blows; and, on the resistance made on your part, and threats probably thrown out, has applied to a justice of the peace, and obtained a warrant to commit you to the custody of the law. What can they make o' it? said Duncan. I do not know, said the Captain, what offence it may be in law, but certainly it was a great indecorum to amuse yourself, not at the expence of a mechanic, but indirectly at the whole body politic of the union; not that I think it unbecoming to send such as Traddle to deliberative a??emblies; blies; but that you seemed to think it so; because it is a thing not known in North-Britain, where aristocratic principles prevail. You might have meant this as pleasantry; but it may be construed a reflection upon a republican government, and to destroy the rights of man, in the first germ and principles of their existence. They canna make high treason o't said Duncan. I do not know, said the Captain, what a strict judge might make it, I should think it could not be made a hanging matter. However let us see the warrant, and enquire what the justice of the peace has made of it. I shall not shew the warrant to any man, said the constable, but to his worship, justice Underchin, to whom I must carry the prisoner immediately. So come along; come along; the justice will shew you the warrant. There being no help for it, Duncan was obliged to go along, the Captain accompanying him. Being brought before the justice, Ah, have ye nabbed him? said his worship: I am glad ye have got him; a great rascal. There is no question, said the Captain, step Vol. IV. G stepping forward, and addressing the justice, but the young man has acted with considerable imprudence; but ignorance of the world, and especially of the laws and customs of America, has been the principal cause of his intrusion. Though he has not been long in my service, yet I am disposed to speak with some confidence of his civility in general. But, may it please your worship, in what shape have you brought the charge. Is it an assault and battery, or what? I make it bastardy, said the justice; what else would I make it? Bastardy! said the Captain. It might be fornication, or adultery; but how can it be bastardy in so short a time? It cannot be a rape, that your worship means. There was no rape, or fornication, or adultery in the case, I will engage that. And how can there be bastardy? some very hot words passed between him and the woman, and strokes might have been given; but there was certainly no disposition, as far as I could see, to beget bastards; nor was there time for it. They were not in such a very loving humour, when I left them; nor did he stay behind me above twenty minutes on the road.The The justice was a little swarthy man, of a corpulent habit, seated in an elbow chair, with pen, ink, and paper on a stand by him. He threw himself back, as he spoke; leaned his head alternately on the right and left shoulder, and bridled his lips, as the phrase is, discovering in the affectation of his manner, great pride of office, and apparent satisfaction in having caught a criminal. Endeavouring to be witty at the embarraslsment of the present culprit, and the expressions of the Captain, why Mr. said he, addressing himself, to this last, though I do not know who you are, that are so willing to assist me in the examination of this vagrant, yet I will observe to you, that I make no doubt that some hot, or at least warm words, have passed between them; and strokes as you call it, might have been given; but as to the time of twenty minutes, or a larger period, it is of no consideration in the law; provided the woman swears, as this one has done, that she is with child by him. Nor will his ignorance of the customs of America, excuse him; we must commit him, or bind him over, if he can find security, to appear at the sessions, to take his trial for the fornication.Wi' Wi' bairn! said Duncan. She might just as well have ta'en an oath, that I was wi' bairn to her. Was na her man I raddle, sitting on his loom looking at us a' the time. O the false jade! I get her wi' bairn! I wad get a witch wi' bairn as soon. It is extraordinary, said the Captain, that she could be certain of her pregnancy in so short a time? So short a time! said the justice, do you call six months a short time? It is not six hours, said the Captain, nor the half of it, since the fracas happened. Guid guide us! said Duncan, who was standing on the back ground, making his soliloquy; Guid guide us, that I should come to America, to be tri'd for getting a woman wi' bairn. What will Mr. Dougal, our minister think o' this? after ha'ing the Confession of Faith wi' me, and sae mony guid bukes. Standing on the stool, is bad enough; but nathing to the way they hae i' this kintra, o' taking a man wi' a bum, and bringing him before a magistrate; just the same thing as he ware a sheep-stealer. O' the base jade, to swear a bairn upon me; what will my ain folks say say, when they hear o' it in Scotland? It will be a stain upon a' my kin to the third generation. It was the deel himself put it in my head, to stand taking wi' a fool weaver about his election. I wish I ware in Perth again, and out o' a' this trouble. Six hours! said the justice, answering to the Captain. Is it not six months, Sampson, referring to the constable, since this pedlar left this settlement? Pedlar! said the Captain; he never was a pedlar; nor is it six months, since he left Scotland. He was recommended to me by a gentleman whom I knew very well, Mr. M`Donald, as a lad just come over. So that it is impossible he could have been here six months ago. I am no sax months frae Perth, said Duncan. Is not your name, Ryburn, said the justice, and are you not that Scotch pedlar, that was in this settlement two or three months? Can there be any mistake? referring to the constable; is not this Niel Ryburn, for whom the warrant calls? It is the very man, said the constable. I knew him by his dialect the moment I saw him in the porch at the public house, talking with the hostler. He has the same brogue upon his tongue, and says Guid guide us, just G 2 just in the same manner: only at that time he used to say also, By my fa'th, and by my sa'l, more than he does at present. He has become religious since, or pretends to be so, in order to deceive your worsship. But at that time, he had not much religion about him, and had no guid bukes as he calls them in his pocket; but could damn his sa'l, and swear like a devil. Niel Ryburn! said the Captain, that is not the name of my valet. It is that of Duncan Ferguson. But pray who is the woman that he is said to have got with child? The weaver's wife is the only one that he has had a conversation with to my knowledge; and as I said before, they were not much in the way of making love when I left them. A weaver's wife! said the justice; no, Mr. M`Radin, or whatever else they may call you; it is no weaver's wife; it is Kate Maybone, that has made oath against him. He had carnal knowledge of her about six months ago, when he was in this settlement pedling, and got her with child. I perceive said the Captain, we are all at cross purposes, and under a mistake in this business. This North Briton— Stop, said the justice, if you are to give your your testimony, Mr. with the cocked hat, speaking to the Captain; we shall take it by yourself; and not let the pedlar hear it, to enable him to frame his story to the fame purpose. Accordingly Duncan being withdrawn, in the custody of the constable, the Captain was examined, and related the particulars on oath of all that he knew respecting the prisoner; and now being ordered to withdraw, the prisoner was called in and interrogated. His story was to the same effect with that of the Captain, and would seem to distinguish him from his countrymen named in the warrant; but his Scottish dialect founded the presumption of identity so strongly, that it was difficult, if not impossible, to get over it. I see, said the justice, that they have framed their stories by collusion. They are a couple of ingenious rascals; though the one of them, the pedlar, affects great simplicity; and the other vouches for him that he is ignorant. I believe I must commit them both; the one for bastardy, and the other for horse-stealing. For the circumstance of having but one horse between them, is extremely suspicious, and renders it it probable that they must have stolen that one. The story which they tell, of having come in company with a revenue officer, whom they have sent a head on foot, is absurd, especially when you add what the one who is called Captain tells, of this officer having been once his servant, or passed for such, under the name of Teague O'Regan, and bog-trotting as he calls it, in the manner that this Duncan, which he pretends is the name, does now; and yet even then being likely to be taken from him to preach, to go to Congress, and the Lord knows what: It is impossible; it must be a falsehood; and the probability is, that this fellow, this Captain, is the head of a gang of horse-thieves; and this Scotch pedlar, and the Irish revenue officer, are Iri?h"&gt;Irish revenue officer, are under-strappers, with him, in the trade. Ths being signified to the Captain who was now called in, he addressed the justice to the following effect: Mr. Justice, said he, what I have related to you upon oath, however improbable it may appear, is the fact; and as to your surmises of horse stealing, they are groundless; and you may commit, if you think proper; but you shall answer for the consequences. It is no small matter to deprive a citizen of his li- liberty, and I am not so much unknown to the government, as not to obtain redress against an ignoramus like you, who disgrace the commission by your stupidity, as many of the same office do. The utmost of your power is to commit; but it may come in my turn to impeach, for your abuse of power. What proof, or presumption have you, that I have stolen horses? Is it that of having a servant on foot, rather than having one mounted? If I had stolen one horse, could I not as well have stolen two? The presumption is the reverse of what your worship states. As to the North Briton, who is charged with bastardy, by the name of Niel Ryburn, with a certain Kate Maybone, where is the woman? cannot she be brought face to face with the man, and confronted? Let her then say if this is Niel Ryburn; and that this simple lad is the person who begot a child with her, six or eight months ago. I am persuaded he was on the east of the Atlantic at that time, and if she could become pregnant by him, she must have been on that side also. Let this matter be examined. From the sedate and firm manner with which the Captain had expressed himself, the the justice began to be apprehensive of having been mistaken, and was intimidated. He was willing therefore to send for the woman who had made the oath. Being in the village, she was in a short time brought before his worship, by the constable who had been dispatched for that purpose. Kate, said the magistrate, is not this the Scotch pedler, the father of your child, and against whom you have made oath? The father of my child! said Kate; does your worship think, I would let such a servant looking son of a bitch as that, get me with child? does your worship mean to affront me, by having him taken up in the place of the moving merchant, Mr. Ryburn? no, no; he is not the father of my child. I never saw the clumsy looking dunce in my life before. Duncan was well pleased to be relieved from the charge of bastardy; but at the same time a little hurt, at the undervaluing of the witness. Young lady, said he, I wish you muckle joy o' your big belly, but I dinna envy the pedlar o' his guid luck o' ha'eing you wi' bairn. If I was to stand i' the stool, it should be for anither sort of luking lassie; and no sik a brazen fac'd ane as ye are.Kate Kate was about to make reply; but the justice not thinking it comported with the dignity of office, to suffer an altercation in his presence, and being chagrined at not finding this to be the real culprit, released the arrest, with ill humour, desiring Captain, prisoner, Kate, and constable, to be gone about their business.CHAP. CHAP. X. THE second day after this, in the afternoon of the day, as the Captain and his man Duncan were advancing on their journey, they perceived a person a head, coming towards them, with a long slouching walk, as if in considerable haste, and a stick in his hand. If that man had not his face the wrong way, said the Captain, I should take him for the revenue officer, Teague O'Regan; he has a good deal of his appearance, both in his person and his gait. But he cannot have mistaken his direction so much as to be coming this way, instead of going to his district. I dinna ken, said Duncan; these Irish ay put the wrang end o' their speech foremost; and why not put the wrang end o' their course now and then. As they were debating, the person approached, and it was discovered to be Teague. He He had advanced to a pass of the mountain, where he was met and opposed by two men, of an athletic personal appearance, who forbade him, at his peril, to proceed farther. They were armed with clubs, and presented a very choleric countenance. The revenue officer had thought it not advisable to encounter them, being two to one, and proposed rather to fall back, and join himself to the Captain and the Scotchman, who might support him in his march. These two men were of the name of Valentine and Orson; so called either from the fierceness of their nature, or from their superior strength, resembling the two champions of that name, of whom we read in books of romance. They had been born and bred in these mountains. Valentine had the advantage of some education with a Welsh school-master, who passed his native language upon the young man for Latin; so that conceiving himself to have acquired the rudiments of this tongue, and therefore qualified to enter on the study of some one of the learned professions, he had deliberated whether he should plead law, preach, or be a physician; but happening one day to see a member ber Vol. IV. H of Congress riding along, with a boy behind him, carrying a portmanteau, he had taken it into his head to be a member himself, and had canvassed frequently for that delegation; but had been disappointed; one person and another coming forward, and taking off the votes. He had made up his mind for some time past to make an experiment of personal force, to intimidate competitors. For this purpose, he had taken to his assistance another young man of the name of Orson, whom he found in the neighbourhood, and with whom sallying out as a kind of squire, or armour-bearer, he could knock down any fellow that had the impudence to set up against him in the district. Orson had not actually been suckled by a bear, like his name sake in romance; but he was a rough, stout man, and well qualified to bear a part in this mode of canvassing. The rumour had prevailed by some means, that Teague was coming forward to stand a trial in that district; whether propagated by some wag, who passed him on the road, and was disposed to amuse himself with the apprehensions of the two rustics; or to some mistake on the parr of tra- travellers, who had come through the village in the neighbourhood. The Captain, however, and the revenue officer himself, had resolved their menace into a dislike of the excise law, and a wish to intimidate, or prevent by force, the opening an inspection office in that district. Under these impressions, advancing to the pass, they were met by the young men, who made a shew of battle; though on their part, not a little disconcerted at seeing Teague return with a reinforcement, and with the advantage of cavalry. The Captain placed himself in the center, on horse-back, and a little in advance of the two wings on foot, Duncan and Teague. The North Briton, preserved a composed manner, and shewed a steady countenance. The Hibernian, on the other hand, willing by an appearance of great rage, and much valour, to supercede the necessity of battle, or blood-shed, stood with his right foot before the left, flourishing his cudgel, and grinning like an angry person, who was impatient for the onset. As is the manner of heroic men, the Captain thought proper, before the commencement of hostilities, to accost the adver?e verse combatants, to see whether it might not be in his power to remove, or at least allay their prejudices against the obnoxious law, and induce them to suffer the officer to pass. Accordingly he addressed them in the following words: Gentlemen, said he, the law may be exceptionable on general principles, or locally unequal in its operation to you in this district. Nevertheless, it is the law, and has received the sanction of the public voice, made known through the constitutional organ, the representatives of the people. It is the great principle of a republican government, that the will of the majority shall govern. The general will has made this a law, and it behoves individual minds to submit. I wad na fleech and prig wi' them, said Duncan, stepping forward, and flourishing his cudgel. I wad na hae many words about it. But just see at ance whether they will dare to stap the high road. Gin they persist, I can tak ane o' them, and ye and Teague, can tak the ither, and my lug for it, I sal gie the ane that fa's to my lot, a weel payed skin, I warrant him. Sae dinna ye tak up time fairlying about the matter; but gae on, and try our rungs o'er the the hurdies o' them. I sal gar this stick crack o'er the riggin o' the loons, in a wie while. Teague, in the mean time, was on the back ground, endeavouring to look sour, making wry mouths, and grinning occasionally: all this with a view to support the threats of the North Briton. Duncan, said the Captain, for he had not attended to Teague, put up your cudgel. Policy oftentimes avails more than force. The law in question may beodious, and great allowance ought to be made for the prejudices of the people. By sost measures, and mild words, prejudices may be overcome. These appear to be but young men; and rashness is a concomitant of early life. By expostulation we may probably have the good fortune to be able to pass on, without being under the necessity to attempt battery, or shed blood. The two young men were not to be intimidated by a shew of cudgels, or grinning, and wry mouths; but still conceiving that the object of the Captain was to force an election in favour of his precusor, the Hibernian, and not understanding the scope of his harrangue, but ?upposing sing H 2 him to speak of the law of election where the votes of the majority, that is, the greater number of votes, constitutes the representative, they were as much disposed to use force as at first; and, advancing, appeared ready to sustain the shock. An affray must have ensued; for the Captain having taken every possible measure to avoid blows, was now resolute to force the pass, even at the risk of battle. But just at this instant, a grave man coming from the village, who had known the character, and had been frequently a witness of the conduct of the young men, addressed them: “Young men, said he, will you be eternally running into errors of this kind. Have you interrogated these gentlemen, and understood from themselves whether any of them are candidates, and mean to disturb you by setting up for Congress in this district? It is possibly the humour of some wag coming up the road, and knowing your disposition, that has created the surmise.” The fact was, that some wag who had passed Teague on the road, and who had known the apprehensions of Valentine, had given rise to the report. For he thought to amuse himself by it, knowing the extravagancies gancies into which it would of course throw the two young men. For the whole country, not long before that time, had heard in what manner they had mistaken individuals for public candidates. On one occasion they had fought with a mason and his barrow-man, and abused them considerably. On another occasion, they had knocked down a potter with a bag of earthen-ware, and broke several of his vessels. For this reason, the grave man, of whom I spoke, who had got a hint by some means of what they were about, had traced the young men, and coming up at the critical moment, addressed them as I have before said, exhorting them to make enquiry first, whether their apprehensions were well or ill founded; and not to take it for granted that either of these personages, were competitors for Congress, before the fact had been ascertained, and their pretensions considered by an amicable expostulation. Candidates for Congress! said the Captain; what could have put that into the young mens heads? is it true, this bog-trotter, who is now an excise officer, was on the point once of being a candidate, or at least of being elected, a repre?entative tive of the union; but having escaped that, though with some difficulty, he is now in the executive department; and has received an appointment to the collection of the revenue of a district beyond this, to which he is now on his way; and is far from having any thoughts of an election of any kind whatever. The two young men, at this, were relieved from their fears, and their minds seemed dilated with unusual joy. Stepping forward, they shook hands with Teague, and invited him to drink with them; but the Captain apologized, alledging the necessity on the part of O'Regan, to press forward as speedily as possible, and to be on the spot where the functions of his duty called him. This apology seeming to suffice, they all three made obeisance to the young men, and to the grave looking man; and passed on.CHAP CHAP. XI. Containing Reflections. It may be thought preposterous in these young men to attempt force in the matter of an election. That depends on their possessing any other faculty by which they could succeed. Have not all animals recourse to these means of providing for themselves, which nature has given them? The squirrel climbs a tree, while the wolf runs through the brake. The cat lies in wait, and watches for her prey; while the greyhound pursues with open mouth, and seizes the hare or the fox. Valentine would not seem to have possessed the advantage of mental recommendations; he could not have it in his power to allure and persuade. Why not therefore act by compulsion, and use force? But why not make application of this force upon the voters themselves, and knock down either before or after an election, all all those who had been obstinate, in withholding their suffrages? It is probable that experiment had been made of this, and that it had been found ineffectual. What then remained, but to repel the intrusion of competitors. It was more convenient, as there were fewer of these; at least it rarely happens, that there are as many candidates as voters. It seems more natural, as beginning at the source, and repressing the pretensions of the canvassing individuals, who are usually the first movers in the business. It is of the nature of a summary proceeding, and avoids delay, to break the head of a competitor, and induce him by fear, if not by modesty, to desist. It may be queried, what respectability in the capacity of legislators can such persons have, after having been elected, without the requisite information on state affairs, or talent of eloquence, to make a figure in a public body? That is no business of mine. It belongs to these that set up for such appointment, to consider this. It may be said, however, that it is not necessary that all should make a figure in the same way. In the exhibition of a circus, you will be as much diverted with the clown who mounts mounts a horse clumsily, or who attempting to tumble, falls on his backside, as with the greatest activity shewn by the master. In music, bass is useful; nay, may be thought to be necessary, to mix with the treble. An illetirate and ignorant member of a deliberative assembly, forms an agreeable contrast with the intelligent; just as in gardening, we are pleased with a wild copse after a parterre. It may be thought a vesania, or species of madness, to entertain such an inordinate passion for the legislature. Not at all; it was not a madness properly so called, by which I mean, a physical derangement of the intellect. The cause was merely moral; and the derangement only such as exists in all cases, where the mind is not well regulated by education, and where the passions are strong and intemperate. This young man Valentine had conceived, at an early period, the idea of becoming a legislator; and as has been said, from seeing some member of Congress pass the road, with a servant and portmanteau also; not at all comprehending the necessity, or at least usefulness, of a knowledge of the geography of the world in commercial questions; or of history in pol- political: he had been accustomed at home to run a foot race with a wood-ranger; to lift a piece of timber at a house building, or log-rolling; or to wrestle at Cornish-hug with the young men of the village; and had imagined that the same degree of strength and dexterity, which had given him a superiority, or at least made him respectable in these, would raise him to reputation in the efforts of the human mind. Why need we wonder at an uneducated young man judging so preposterously on great subjects. It is not to be presumed that he ever had an opportunity of reading Cudworth's Intellectual System, or any other writer on “the eternal fitness of things.” This belongs to the schools; I mean the higher academies, where metaphysics, and the co-relate science of logic, is taught. I am aware that malevolent persons, judging from their feelings, will alledge that in the caricature I have given of the mountain candidate, I have had some prototype in view, and hence intended a satire upon individuals It will not be a fair deduction; unless it is restrained simply to this, that something like it has occurred in the course of my observation, which has given rise to my idea of the picture.Now Now that I am upon the subject of elections for deliberative assemblies, I will make a few general observations, without meaning to give offence to any one. There are but two characters that can be respectable as representatives of the people. A plain man of good sense, whether farmer, mechanic, or merchant; or a man of education and literary talents. The intermediate characters, who have neither just natural reflection, nor the advantage of reading, are unnatural, and can derive no happiness to themselves from the appointment; nor can they be of use to the commonwealth. But men err, not only judging falsely of their capacity for a public trust, but in the means of obtaining it. I have in view, not only all indelicacy in the solicitation of votes, but in the management that is too often used on election days, in changing tickets, obstructing windows, voting more than once; a thing tolerable perhaps, or at least excusable, in the election of a sheriff, an office of profit; but which ought to be considered indelicate in a competition for honour. It is impossible for any law to reach the cure of this evil; it can be remedied only by attaching disgrace in public opinion, Vol. IV. I opinion, to them or the like arts. I do not mean to represent as indelicate the candidates offering to serve. For I would rather be accused of forwardness to offer myself, that of affectation to decline, when I was willing to be elected. The one favours of cowardice and falsehood; the other, at the worst, can be called but vanity. The wife and virtuous exercise of the right of suffrage, is the first spring of happiness in a republic. If this is touched corruptly, or unskilfully, the movements of the machine are throughout affected. Not only judicious regulations by positive law are necessary to secure this, but the system of family and scholastick education ought to contemplate it. An advice which no father ought to fail to give to his son should be to this effect. “Young man, you have the good fortune to be born in a republic; a felicity that has been enjoyed but by a small portion of the race of man, in any age of the world. In some ages it has been enjoyed by none at all. It is a principle of this government, that every man, has a right to elect, and a right to be elected. In the exercise of the first, the right to elect, be taught my son, to preserve a scrupulous and delicate honour: And as at at school, the sense of shame amongst your equals, would restrain you from all fraud, in obtaining a game at fives; so much more now that your are a man, let it restrain you from all unfairness in this the great game of man. With regard to being elected, your first consideration will be your talent. Quid valeant humeri, quid ferre recusent. At school, you would despise the boy who would set himself forward, as an expert swimmer or wrestler, who was deficient in skill at these exercises. In order to be respectable, put not yourself above your strength. If you covet the honour of a public trust, think of qualifying yourself for it; and let the people think of chusing you to discharge it; that is their business. Lay in a stock of knowledge by reading in early life. Your old age, by these means will acquire dignity; and appointments will readily follow. You will be under no necessity of solliciting inordinately the suffrage of men.”CHAP CHAP. XII. THE Captain and the two on foot, journeyed from bence together, without any material incident falling out, or any thing to attract the attention; save what arose from the sparring of the aro?e"&gt;arose from the sparring of the bog-troppers. This took place on the ground of irreligion in Teague, and disregard for the covenants; but more especially on a difference of opinion with regard to the desert of their respective services, in the late rencounter with the highway-men, as they were disposed to call them; Teague alledging that he had intimidated them by grinning, and wry mouths; Duncan claiming the credit by the display of his cudgel. The Captain had a good deal of trouble, in parrying a decision of their respective pretensions; or adjusting them in such a manner as to satisfy both. They were likely sometimes to come to blows. He was relieved, however, by the approach of of the revenue officer to his district, into which they now began to enter. After some days peregrination through it, having made choice of a central situation, it was thought proper to open an inspection office, which was done by hiring a house, and writing over the door, Inspection office of Survey, No. &amp;c. Suspicion had existed on the part of the government, that opposition would be made in this district to the opening an office; or at least to the collection of the revenue. These were founded not only in reports of threats of that nature; but in some instances of actual violence, clandestinely committed on deputies. It was for this reason, amongst others, that the President had made choice of O'Regan, a stout and resolute man, as he thought him, with a shelalah in his hand, who could repel occasional insults. So far these suspicions appeared to be without foundation; the officer having conspicuously traversed the district, and opened an office without molestation. The Captain was now about to return home, having seen the establishment of his ward in an office under government. But before he parted with him, he thought it not I 2 not amiss to give him lessons with regard to the discharge of his duty in his present appointment. With this view, drawing him into a walk the second day, a small distance from the village, he began his lecture in the following words: Teague, said he, for I am still in the habit of giving you that appellation, not having yet ascertained whether you are to be stiled, your worship, your honour, or your reverence; or at least not having yet been accustomed to add these epithets; Teague, I say, you are now advanced to great dignity; a limb of the executive of the union. It is true, your department is ministerial. Nevertheless it requires the wisdom of the head to conduct it. But the integrity of the heart is the great object to be regarded. Keep your hands from bribes; and by a delicate impartiality towards all, even from the suspicion of taking them. I should regret indeed after all the pains I have taken in sitting you for an office, and contributing to your appointment, to hear of an impeachment against you, for a misdemeanor in that office. By conducting yourself with a scrupulous honour and pure morality in your present trust, the way is open open to a higher grade of advancement; and there is no kind of doubt, but that in due time it will be attainable. The President of the United States, from whom you have received your commission, is said to have the virtue, or rather the excess of one, never to abandon the person whom he has once taken up; or at least to carry his attachment to an extreme of reluctance in that particular; whether owing to great slowness in conceiving unfavourably of any one; or to pride of mind, in an unwillingness to have it thought that his judgment could be fallible. You will have an advantage here; but at the same time there is an ultimate point in this, as in all things, beyond which it is impossible to preserve a man. Bear this in mind, and be honest, attentive, and faithful in your duty, and let it be said of you, that you have shewn yourself a good citizen. Just at this instant a noise was heard, and, looking up, a crowd of people were discovered at a considerable distance, advancing towards them, but with acclamations that began to be heard. They were dragging a piece of timber of considerable length, which appeared to be just hewn from the woods; and was the natural stem of of a small tree, cut down from the stump, and the bark stripped off. At the same time a couple of pack-horses were driven along, which appeared to be loaded with beds, and pillow cases. The Captain was led to believe that these were a number of the country people, who having heard of the revenue officer coming to his district, had come forward to pay their respects to him, and to receive him with that gratulation which is common to honest but illiterate people, in the first paroxysms of their transport. Having understood that country to be chiefly peopled with the descendants of the Irish, or with Irish emigrants themselves, he had supposed that hearing the new officer was a countryman, they had been carried forward, with such zeal to receive him, with huzzaing and tumult. On this occasion, he thought it not amiss to turn the conversation; and to prepare the mind and the manners of the deputy for this scene, which being unusual, might disconcert and embarrass him. Teague, said he, it is not less difficult to preserve equanimity in a prosperous situation, than to sustain with fortitude a depression of fortune. These people, I perceive, ceive, ceive, in a flow of mind are coming forward, to express, with warmth, the honest, but irregular sallies of their joy, on your arrival amongst them. It was usual in the provinces under the Roman republic, when a Questor, of whom a favourable impression had preceded, was about to come amongst them. It is a pleasing, but a transient felicity, and a wise man will not count too much upon it. For popular favour is unstable to a proverb. These very people in the course of a twelve-month, if you displease them, may shout as loud at your degradation, and removal from dignity. At the same time, this ought not to lead you to be indifferent, or at least to seem so, to their well-meant expressions of favour at present; much less to affect a contempt, or even a neglect of them. A medium of ease and gracefulness in receiving their advance, and answering their address, whether it be a rustic orator in an extempore harrangue, or some scholar of the academy, or school-master, they may have have prevailed upon to draw up a speech, and read it to you. There is no manner of doubt, but the President of the United States, may have been a thousand times embarrassed with the multitude of of addresses delivered, or presented, to him; and it required no small patience and fortitude to sustain them. Yet it has been remarked, that he has received them all with complacency; shewing himself neither elevated with the praise, nor irritated with the intrusion. And it is but reasonable, and what a benevolent man would indulge; for it is a happiness to these creatures, to give themselves the opportunity of being distinguished in this manner. Duncan who had heard a rumour in the village of what was going forward, had in the mean time come up, and understanding from the last words of the Captain what had been the drift of his conversation with Teague, and discovering his mistake, interrupted him at this place. Captain, said he, ye need na be cowshuning him against applause, and popularity, and the turning o' the head, wi' praise, and guid usage: for I doubt muckle if it comes to that wi' him yet. I wad rather suspect that these folks have na guid will towards him. I dinna ken what they mean to do wi' him, but if a body might guess frae the bed ye see there on the poney's back, they mean to toss him in a blanker. But if it were were to be judged frae the tree they hae trailing after them, I wad suppose they mean to make a hanging matter o' it, and take his life a' the gether. There is na doubt but they are coming in a mob, to make a seizure o' the gauger, and the talk o' the town is o' a punishment I dinna understand, o' tarring and feathering. I have heard o' the stocks, and the gallows, and drowning like a witch, but I never heard o' the like o' that in Scotland. I have heard o' tarring the sheep, to keep them frae the rot, but I never heard o' tarring a human creature. May be they mean to put it on his nose, to hinder him frae smelling their whiskey. I see they got a keg o't there in their rear, drawn upon a sled; at least, I suppose it to be whisky they hae in that keg, to take a dram, as they gae on wi the frolic; unless it be the tar that they talk of to put upon the officer. This last conjecture was the true one. For it was tar; and the stem of a tree which they drew, was what is called a liberty pole, which they were about to erect, in order to dance round it, with hallooing, and the whoop of exultation. The calvacade now approaching, they began began to cast their eyes towards the groupe of the three as they stood together. By de holy faders, said Teague, I see de have deir looks upon me. De look as wild as de White Boys, or de Hearts of Oak in Ireland. By de holy apostles, dere is no fighting wid pitch forks; we shall be kilt, and murdered into de bargain. Teague, said the Captain, recollect that you are an officer of government, and it becomes you to support its dignity, not betraying unmanly fear, but sustaining the violence even of a mob itself with fortitude. Fait, and I had rader be no officer at all, said Teague, if dis is de way de paple get out o' dair senses in dis country. Take de office yourshelf; the devil burn me, but I shall be after laying it down, as fast as I ever took it up, if dis is to come of it; to be hooted at like a wild baste, and shot, and hanged upon a tree, like a squirrel, or a Pady from Cork, when de foolish boys hang him upon the 17th of March, with potatoes about his neck, to make sun o' de Irish. I scorn to be choaked before I am dead; de devil burn de office for me, I'l have none of it. I can take my Bible oath, and swear upon de holy cross cross, dat I am no officer. By shaint Patrick, and ifdere are any Irish boys, amongst dem I would rather join wid dem. What is de government with offices to a son o'd a whore dat is choaked, and cannot spake to his acquaintance in dis world. By de holy, apostles, I am no officer; I just took it for, a frolic as I was coming up de road, and; you may be officer yourself, and good luck wid de commission, Captain; I shall have noting to do wid it. At this instant the advancing croud; raised a loud shout, crying, Liberty and no excise, liberty and no excise; down with all excise officers. Teague began to tremble, and to sculk behind the Captain. By de holy vater o' de confession, said he, dey are like de favages, dey have deir eyes upon me, I shall be scalped; I shall be kilt and have de hair off my head, like a wolf or a shape. God love you, Captain, spake a good word to dem, and tell dem a good story; or by de Christian church, I shall be eat up like a toad, or a wild baste in de forests. The bog-trotter was right; for this moment, they had got their eyes upon the groupe; and began to distinguish him as the officer of the revenue. An exact description scrip- Vol. IV. K had been given them, of his person and appearance; for these people had their correspondents, even at the feat of government; and travellers, moreover, had recognised him, and given an account of his physiognomy, and apparel. There he is, there he is, was the language; the rescally excise officer; we shall soon take care of him. He is of the name of O'Regan, is he? We shall O'Regan him in a short time. The devil burn me, if I am de excise officer, said Teague. It is all a mistake gentlemen. It is true I was offered the commission; but the Captain here knows dat I would not take it. It is dis Scotchman that is the officer. By my shoul, you may tar and feather him, and welcome. No, said the Captain stepping forward, no, gentlemen: for so I yet call you; though the menaces which you express, and the appearance of force which your preparations exhibit, depart from the desert of that appelation. Nevertheless, as there is still a probability of arresting violence, and reclaiming you from the error of your meditated acts, I address you with the epithet of gentlemen. You are not mistaken in your designation of the officer of of the revenue, though he has not the cundour, to avow himself; but would meanly subject a fellow bog-trotter to the odium and the risk; an act of which, after all the pains that have been taken of his education, to impress him with sentiments of truth and honour, I am greatly ashamed. No, Gentlemen, I am unwilling to deceive you, or that the meditated injury should fall on him, who if he has not the honour of the office, ought not to bear the occasional disadvantage: I am ready to acknowledge and avow, nor shall these wry faces, and contorsions of body, which you observe in the red-headed man, prevent me; that he is the bona fide, actual excise officer. Nevertheless, gentlemen, let me expostulate with you on his behalf. Let me endeavour to save him from your odium, not by falsehood, but by reason. Is it not a principle of that republican government which you have established, that the will of the majority shall govern; and has not the will of the majority of the United States enacted this law? will— By this time, they had sunk the but end of the sapling in the hole dug for it, and it stood erect with a flag displayed in the air, and was called a Liberty Pole. The beds beds, and pillow cases had been cut open, and were brought forward. A committee had been appointed to conduct the operation. It was while they were occupied in doing this, that the Captain had without interruption gone on in making his harangue. But these things being now adjusted, a principal person of the committee came forward, just at the last words of the Captain. The will of the majority, said he; yes, faith; the will of the majority shall govern. It is right that it should be the case. We know the excise officer very well. Come lay hands upon him. Guid folk, said Duncan, I am no the gauger, it is true; nor am I a friend to the excise law, though I came in company wi' the officer; nevertheless I dinna approve o' this, o' your dinging down the government. For what is it but dinging down the government to act against the laws. Did ye never read i' the Bible, that rebellion is warse than witchcraft? Did ye never read o' how many lairds, and dukes, were hanged in Scotland lang ago, for rebellion? when the government comes to take this up, ye sal all be made out rebels, and hanged. Ye had better think what ye ye are about. Ye dinna gie fair play. If ye want to fight, and ony o' ye will turn out wi' me, I shall take a turn wi' him; and no just jump upon a man a' in ae lump, like a parcel o' tinklers at a fair. The committee had paid no attention to this harangue; but had in the mean time seized Teague, and conveyed him to a cart, in which the keg of tar had been placed. The operation had commenced amidst the vociferation of the bog-trotter, crossing himself, and preparing for purgatory. They had stripped him of his vestments, and pouring the tar upon his naked body, emptied at the same time a bed of feathers on his head, which adhering to the viscous fluid, gave him the appearance of a wild fowl of the forest. The cart being driven off with the prisoner in this state, a great part of the mob accompanied, with the usual exclamation of “Liberty, and no excise law. Down with all excise officers.”CHAP K 2 CHAP. XIII. Containing Reflections. It is time now to make some reflections, were it not only for the sake of form; just as the clergyman who divides his text into several heads, and then adds, “we shall conclude with an improvement of the whole; or with a few practical observations, or reflections.” In early life, when long sermons tired me, the young mind not capable of a long attention, I used to look out for this peroratory part of the discourse, with much anxiety; not that I valued it more than any other, for the intrinsic worth of it; but merely because it was the last. It appeared to me an unconscionable thing in a man to speak too long, when it was left to himself how long he should speak. Ah! if it was known how many curses I have given tedious speakers even in the pulpit itself, in my time, I should be thought a very wick- wicked man. Perhaps some may think that I am a tedious writer. Well; but have not readers it in their power to lay down the book when they think proper, and begin again? But as I was saying, it has become time to make some reflections, of which it must be acknowledged, I have been sparing in this the latter part of my performance. But upon what shall I reflect? The vanity of things, doubtless. But in what mode shall I present this vanity? In moralizing on the disappointment of the Captain and the revenue officer, with the waiting man Duncan Ferguson, coming forward to establish offices, and all at once made prisoners, and treated as the meanest culprits? or shall it be on the mistaken patriotism of even good, though uninformed men, opposing an obnoxious, and unequal law, not by remonstrance, but by actual force, and thereby sapping all principle, or rather overthrowing all structure of a republican government. No: these are exhausted topics. I shall rather content myself at present, with a differtation, on that mode of disgrace, or punishment, which was chosen in the case of the revenue officer; tarring and feathering.I I find no trace of this mode of punishment amongst the ancients, I mean the Greeks, Hebrews, and Romans. Having had occasion lately to look over the whole book of Deuteronomy, I have paid attention to this particular, and have discovered no vestige of it. Amongst the Greeks, so far as my memory serves me, there is nothing like it. I recollect well the sanctions of criminal law amongst the Romans. And what appears to me to come nearst to this of tarring and feathering, is the punishment of the sewing up the culprit in a sack, with an ape, a serpent, and a fox; and throwing him into a river, or a balon of the sea, to drown, if he had escaped death by his companions in the mean time. As to the origin of tarring and feathering, I am at a loss to say. It would seem to me, that it took its rise in the town of Bofton, just before the commencement of the American revolution. Unless, indeed, it should be contended that Nebuchadnezzar was tarred and feathered; of which I am not persuaded; because tho' it is said that “his nails had grown to eagles claws,” and in that case presenting the talons of a bird, which a tarred and fea- feathered man resembles, yet at the sam time it is added, he eat grass like an ox. Now a turkey buzzard, or a bald eagle, does not eat grass like an ox; nor do I know that these sowls eat grass at all, at least so obviously as to make the eating grass a distinguishing characteristic of their nature. I shall therefore give up the hypothesis of Nebuchadnezzar being tarred and feathered. It would appear to me to be what may be called a revolutionary punishment, beyound what in a settled state of the government may be inflicted by the opprobrium of opinion; and yet short of the coercion of the laws. It was in this middle stare, that it took it's rise with us; answering the same end, but with a more mild operation, than that of the lantern, at the commencement of the revolution in France. It took rise in the sea coast towns in America; and I would suppose it to be owing to some accidental conjunction of the seamen and the citizens, devising a mode of punishment for a person obnoxious. The sailors naturally thought of tar, and the women, who used to be assisting on these occasions, thought of bolsters and pillowcases. Let Let it suffice that I have suggested the question, and leave it to be settled by some other person, at some future period. CHAP. XIV. WITH regard to Teague whom we left in the hands of the unob, having been carted about the village, until the eyes of all were satiated with the spectacle, he was dismissed, but ordered to depart from what was called the survey, under the penalty of being seized again, and hanged on the liberty pole, to which they pointed at the same time, and on which there was a cross bar, which appeared to render it convenient for that purpose. The unfortunate officer was not slow to take the hint, but as soon as he was out of their hands, made his way to the wilderness. There we shall leave him for the present, and return to the Captain, whom we left in the village, and who had been employed during the occasion, reasoning with with the people, and endeavouring first to divert them from the outrage, and afterwards to convince them of the error of it, and the danger of the consequences. Instead of allaying their fervour, and convincing their judgments, it had begun to provoke, and irritate exceedingly; and gave birth to surmises that he was an accomplice of the excise officer, which in a short time grew into a rumour, that he meant to continue the inspection office, and substitute the North Briton as a deputy in the room of O'Regan, until his return. Under this impression, assembling next day, they proceeded to pull down the inspection office altogether, and to enquire for the Captain and his valet, that they might tar and feather them also. The Captain having had a hint of this, and judging from the experiment he had made, that it was in vain to oppose the violence of the people, outrather to yield to it for the present, thought proper to withdraw from the village for a time, and take his rout to wards the mountains, where he might remain at some farm house, until a more peaceable state of things should take place. He had travelled the greater part of the day, and towards evening when he began to to think of taking quarters for the night, he came to a narrow valley at the foot of the mountain, with a small, but a clear and rapid stream running through the valley, which had the appearance in some parts of a natural meadow, there being intervals of grass plats of considerable extent, with hazel copses, and groupes of young trees. The tall timber on the height above, formed an agreeable shade, and ledges of stone, worn smooth by the water in some places, making small but perpendicular falls in the current of the water. Dismounting, and delaying a little in this spot, to let the horse take a mouthful of the grass, and deliberating whether if no habitation appeared, it might not be agreeable enough to take a bed there on the natural sward for the night; having a small quantity of provisions in Duncan's wallet, and a flask of whiskey, which they haltily put up at setting out. At this instant, an aged and venerable looking man descended from the mountain, with a slender and delicately formed young lad accompanying him, having on his shoulder the carcase of a racoon, which he held by the hinder feet, and which probably ably had been cut out of a hollow tree, or taken in a trap, that afternoon. The Captain thought with himself, that he would have no great objection to have an invitation from the old man and his son, as he supposed him to be, to go home with them, and lodge for the night; taking it for granted from the appearance of understanding in the countenance, that they were of a grade of education above the bulk of the people of that country. It so happened, after explanation had taken place, that he did receive an invitation, and went home with them. The residence was romantic, situate on a small eminence on the north side of the valley which running east and west, the sun struck it with his first beams, and the zephyrs, playing in the direct line of their course, fanned it in the summer heats. A small cascade at a little distance, with a sandy bottom, afforded a delightful bathing place; and the murmur of the falling water, in the silence of the night, was favourable to sleep. It was a cabbin of an oblong figure, perhaps twenty by twelve feet, consisting of two apartments, the one small, and serving as a kitchen, the other answering the pur- Vol.IV. L purposes of hall, parlour, and bed room. —The family consisted of the old man, the young lad his son, and an attendant who acted as cook, butler, and valet de chambre. Duncan having rubbed and combed the Captain's horse, and turned him loose to eat, was stowed away in the kitchen, while the racoon was barbecued for supper, and the Captain with the host, and his son, were pursuing the explanation of what they respectively were; being yet in a great degree unknown to each other. It appeared that the old man was the Marquis de Marnessie, who had been an emigrant from France, a short time after the commencement of the present revolution, and had served some time in a corps of 10,000 men, which had been formed of the nobility, under the combined princes, against the republic. Having been under the necessity of abandoning his seats with precipitation, he had been able to carry with him, but a few thousand livres. These had been reduced in supporting himself and friends in the service, and he had brought but a few hundred to America This country he had been led to seek, disgusted with the combined powers, when the stipulations of the convention of Pilnitz, began to to transpire, and the object appeared to be, not so much to support the monarchy, as to divide the country: chagrined also with that neglect, and even contumely, experienced from the German princes who appeared to think with contempt of their services, and to repose their confidence alone, in their own forces, and discipline. Coming to America, he had retired from the sea coast, both to be out of the way of the French democrats in the towns, and in order to occupy a less expensive residence. He had found this valley unappropriated by the state, a warrant for an hundred acres of which he obtained from the land office, at the low rate of fifty shillings; and having cleared a small spot, had made a garden, and cultivated what is called a patch of Indian corn, subsisting and amusing himself and his family, chiefly by trapping and hunting in the neighbouring mountain; wishing to forget his former feelings, and to live upon the earth as regardless of its troubles as if buried under it. His cabbin was neat and clean, with flooring of split timber, and stools made out of hewn logs. A few books, and half a dozen small paintings, a fuzee, and and an old sword, being the only ornament of its walls. Having supped on the barbecuedracoon, they took bed upon the planks, each furnished with a blanket, being the only matress, or covering with which they were provided. A great deal of conversation had passed in the course of the evening; and considerable sympathy of mind had taken place on the part of the Marquis towards the Captain, considering him in the light of an emigrant with himself, having been obliged to abscond, from sans cullotte rage, and popular servor, which though not of the same height with that in France, yet was of the same nature, and different only in degree. The invitation was given by the Marquis, and accepted on the part of the Captain, and to remain in that retirement for some weeks, until matters were composed, and it might be safe for him to take his way again through the country, and return to his dwelling. Duncan took care of the horse, chopped wood, carried water, and assised the French valet to barbecue racoons, young bears, squirrels, pheasants, partridges, and other game, that the traps traps, or fuzee and dog, of the Marquis and his son, accompanied by the Captain, could procure. Much conversation passed in the mean time, on the affairs of France; sometimes sitting on a rock on the side of the mountain, or under the shade of an elm tree in the grassy valley; or walking out to set a trap; at other times, in an evening in the cabbin, when they had returned from the labour or amusements of the day. These conversations were chiefly in the French language, which the Captain spoke very well; but in relating any particulars of that conversation, we shall give it in English, to save the printer the trouble of having it translated. And we shall confine ourselves to a very few particulars, meaning rather to hasten to the action of the work, than to delay the reader in an episode, longer than is absolutely necessary to let some things be matured, that are next to take place.CHAP L 2 CHAP. XV. IT was one of those temperate and pleasant evenings which in this climate succeed the autumnal equinox, that the Marquis and the Captain walking out together, the subject of the conversation happened to be the right of the people of France to overthrow the monarchy, and establish a republic. The Captain had read the pamphlets of Thomas Paine, entitled, “Rights of Man,” and was a good deal disposed to sabscribe to the elementary principles of that work; a leading doctrine of which is, that at no time can the pact or customs of ancestors forestall or take away the right of descendants to frame whatever kind of government they think proper. This must be understood, said the Marquis, like most other general propositions, with some limitation, or exceptions; or at least some explanation, before the mind of all, at least of mine, can acquiesce in the de- deductions. It may easily be supposed that I am not a proper person to canvass this subject, having been of that class of men, who had all to lose, and nothing to gain, by a revolution in the government of the country where I lived. Nevertheless, if my feelings do not deceive me, I ought not to be considered as a person under great prejudices. For it seems to me, that I am detached from the world, and never more expecting to be restored to my country, so as to live in it with reputation, or even with safety, I am like a person with all his senses awake, and within a few seconds of death; his vanity is asleep, his pride is gone; he looks back upon his pursuits, and his hopes with true philosophy, and makes a proper estimate of all the acquisitions, and all the enjoyments of life. Or rather, I may be thought to resemble a disembodied spirit, who no longer capable of enjoying the false glories of life, is not liable to be seduced by the appearance of them. The shades of departed men in the elysian fields as imagined by the ancients, and painted by the poets, cannot be more abstracted from former impressions, than I feel myself to be, in this kind of elysian, and posthumous valley. When I converse with you who who have come from the world, and may return to it, I am in the situation of the Grecian worthies defunct of life, when visited by Ulysses. Achilles candidly acknowledged to him, that he had rather live as a hired labourer with a poor man, who had little food, than to rule over all the ghosts. I will in like manner declare, that such is my predilection for my country, and that ravishing delight which I would take, in breathing my native air, and feeing my native soil, looking at the buildings which were accustomed to strike my eyes in better days, that I would prefer fishing along the streams for my precarious and daily food, or digging the soil, and procuring my subsistence with a peasant, than to be the President of the United States, deprived of the countenance of my countrymen, and the view of that other heavens, and that other earth. The contempt that I may have entertained, or at least the undervaluing insperable from my situation, which I may have felt, for the undignifyed with nobility amongst us, is totally gone: I could lay myself down, with the meanest plebian, and call him my brother. Descent, title, and fortune, have disappeared from the eyes, and I fee see nothing but man, in his rude and original excellence, as a conversing and sociable animal. Nevertheless, even in this state of mind, I cannot wholly subscribe to the analysis of Paine. Let us examine his position. The new born infant has a right to a support from its ancestor, until it shall be of years to provide for itself; but has it a right to his estate after it shall have been of a mature age? surely not a natural right; nor a right sanctioned in all cases even by the municipal law; for the ancestor may alien, or devise away from the heir. But if he claims as heir, or takes by devise, is it not under the artificial establishment of society, that he makes this claim, or takes this gift? shall he not then take this estate subject to that government in the principle and form of it, under which this estate was acquired, and by which it is preserved to him? The civil relations that exist from the aggregate to him, are a law, as well as the relations that exist from individuals. Suppose all minors of age at one hour, and all ancestors just departed at the same moment, there might be some reason then in supposing that the descendants were not bound by the former er establishments, but were at liberty to introduce others; or the descendants emigrating, and occupying a new soil, are certainly at liberty to frame new structures: But not while a single ancestor exists, who has an interest in the old mansion house, and is attached to the building, however Gothic; because the ancestor had this right before the minor was born, and his birth could not take it away. I say, then, contrary to the principle of Paine, that our ancestors having established an hereditary monarchy, it is not in the power of the descendants to change it. They may remove from under it, if they will, but not pull the house down about our heads. The early feudalist, whose acquisitions, and possession of them, depended on that military subordination and tenure which gave rise to the system, when he took his place in it either as a chestain, or a vassal, submitted to it; he had his voice in this social compact; and shall his descendant be allowed to unhinge the tenure, and change the fabric which was not of his building? shall he claim the advantages of that species of government to which he has been introduced, and not submit to the inequalities qual- of it? or shall it be changed but by universal consent? shall even a majority change it? No: because each individual is, in the language of the law, a joint tenant, and has a right, per my &amp; per tant, in the part, and in the whole. It can no more take away the right an individual has in the system of government, than the right he has in his estate, held by a prior law. Upon investigation, it will be found a question more of power than of right; just as in these woods, I take the racoons and rabbits, not that I conceive mysself to have any right to have come from the banks of the Loire to make these depredations, but that having come, I have the skill to do it. The Captain was led to smile at these last words of the Marquis, as favouring of misanthropy, equalizing the case of brute animals with men. I can easily excuse, said the Captain, this sally of your mind, and must resolve it into the wounds your feelings have received from the reverse of your fortune, and the dreadful outrages which have taken place, in the course of the revolution, from the fury of the human mind. Nor would I call in question wholly the justness of your position, with regard to to the right of changing a mode of government. Nevertheless, it may admit of some discussion in the generality, and be so bounded as to leave some great cases out of the rule. I grant you that the descendant, on the principle of natural right, can claim nothing more of the personal labour of the ancestor, or of his estate, than support, until he shall be of an age which gives strength of mind and body to enable him to provide for himself. But does he not possess by his birth, a right to so much of the soil as is necessary for his subsistence? you will say he may emigrate. But suppose all adjoining known lands already peopled; he cannot emigrate without committing injustice upon others. He must therefore remain. How to preclude him from all right to think, or act in affairs of government, with a view to improve, and to improve is to change, is restraining the mind of man, in a particular capable of the greatest extent, and upon which depends, more than on all things else, the perfection of our species. I would put it upon this point; is it conducive to an amelioration of the state of life, and likely to produce a greater sum of happiness, to innovate upon established forms, or or to let them remain? It is true, indeed, that when we consider the throws and convulsions with which a change in government is usually attended, it ought not to be lightly attempted; and nothing but an extreme necessity for a reform can justify it. It is almost as impossible, comparing a physical with a moral difficulty, to change a government from despotism to liberty, without violence, as to dislodge a promontory from its base, by any other means, than mining and gunpowder. Of that I am convinced, said the Marquis; for there never was a people more generally disposed to a degree of reform, than the people of France, at the commencement of the revolution. The writings of philosophers had prevaded the minds of the highest orders, and it had become the passion of the times to lean towards a certain extent of liberty. It had become the wish of the good, and the humour of the weak, to advance the condition of the peasantry. As an instance of this, I myself had written a book, entitled, “Sur le bonheur de Campagne,” with the express view of depicting the depressed situation of the common people in the country, Vol. IV. M and the means of raising them from that condition. But a reform once begun, it was found impossible to arrest it at a middle point. It may be resolved into a thousand causes, but the great cause was, the insatiable nature of the human mind, that will not be contented with what is moderate. For though there were doubtless a considerable portion of the nobility who were opposed to any diminution of their power and pageantry; yet, on the other hand, as great an evil existed in the wish of extreme equality in others; or rather, a wish to bring all things to a perfect level, that from thence they might begin to ascend themselves. There began to be insincerity on the part of the court, and licentiousness on the part of the people; and finally a contest, lurid and dreadful, like the column of dark clouds edged with blue, and fraught with lightning. A contest so terrible, that I have thought myself happy in escaping from it, even though I have been obliged to call upon the rocks and the mountains to cover me in this valley. The above is a sample of those conversations which took place, between the Marquis and the Captain, during the space of of some weeks which the Captain spent in this rural and obscure recess. In the mean time, the Count, the son of the Marquis, had been dispatched occasionally through the settlement, and to the village where the late outrage had been perpetrated, in order to learn what had become of the revenue officer, as also to ascertain the slate of the public mind, and when it might be safe for the Captain to shew himself in public, and return by the main road to his habitation. Nothing had been heard of O'Regan, but accounts the most unfavourable were obtained of the disposition of the people. The flame of opposition had spread generally, and the whole country appeared to be involved in a common burning. They had demolished all inspection houses, far and near; assembled in committees, and framed resolves of the utmost violence. The obnoxious were banished; and even the lukewarm in the cause were threatened with the destruction of their goods, and injury to their persons. They had begun to frame guillotines, and to talk of taking off the heads of traitors to the cause. The Captain was not a little alarmed at these these proceedings; but the Marquis who had seen the machine of the guillotine in actual operation, was seized with a horrid fear; and he almost imagined to himself that he saw it moving of its own accord towards him; and his reason told him, that it was not all improbable but that it might be brought to approach him very speedily, as the same sans cullotte anarchy and violence began to shew itself in these regions, as had broke out in France. CHAP.XVI. IT may now be time to make some enquiry after the unfortunate excise officer, who had been treated in the manner we have mentioned. The evening the outrage had been committed on him, he had run several miles, naked as he was; if a man may be said to be naked, that is invested with a layer of viscous fluid, and the adhesion of birds feathers to cover him; through much danger ger from the country people, who were ill affected to his office: He had at length gained the recesses of a forest, where he thought himself safe for the night; until near morning, when the barking of wolves at no great distance, as he thought, led him to apprehend the being devoured by these animals, who might take him for an object of their prey. To escape this, he had thought it adviseable to climb a spreading beech tree, and there remained until after sun rise, when two hunters coming along at that early hour, descried him amongst the branches; and not without much surprize and astonishment. At first they took him for a bear; but seeing the feathers, it was decided that he must be of the fowl kind. Nevertheless his face and form, which appeared to be human, made him a monster in creation, or at least a new species of animal, never before known in these woods. They at first hesitated whether to take him down by a shot, or to pass on and leave him unmolested. But at length it was determined to pass on for the present, as if they had not seen him, and to rouse the settlement, to take him with dogs, and the help of men. It would be a valuable ti- M 2 tiquision to have such a creature to carry to the great towns for a show. It might be a fortune to a man. This being resolved on, one of the hunters was dispatched to rouse the settlement, while his comrade in the mean time, had taken his station on an eminence at no great distance, to watch the motions of the wild creature, and give information of his change of situation. The officer in much melancholy of mind had descended from the beech, and was sitting on the point of a rock, looking about him like a bald eagle, when a couple of stout fellows came suddenly behind him, with the folds of ropes, and entrapped his body, so that he could not move his arms, which they took to be wings, but was as tightly laced as a ship's yard arm, when the sails are furled to prepare for a tempest. A cage having been made and put into the bed of a waggon, he was conveyed to the capital, when the proprietors, after having published an advertisement, began to exhibit him as a curiosity, for the sum of a quarter dollar to each grown person, and an eighth of a dollar to the children of families whose parents brought them with them.In In a short time, this uncommon creature, as it was thought to be, became the subject of general conversation; and the Philosophical Society had heard of it. Having called a special meeting, they dispatched two members to ascertain and report the nature of the animal, in a memoir to be inserted in their transactions. The two members accordingly requested of the proprietors an opportunity of a leisurely examination of the animal, and paid them a quarter dollar each extraordinary, for this indulgence. The proprietors were disposed, as was natural, to assist with some particulars of fiction, the singular qualities of the animal they had in charge. They related, that when they first saw it, in its flying from the mountain, it was just alighting on the tree top; that having taken it, they had at first offered it boiled and roasted flesh, but this it refused; but that at length it had come to eat flesh both roasted and sodden with considerable gout, and sometimes even with rapacity. This was false, by the bye, for they had tried the officer with raw flesh at first, which he had refused, and would eat only roasted or boiled. The proprietors informed, that when first first taken, its cries, or voice, was of a mixed sound, between that of a wild cat and heron; but that it had come to have some imitation of the human voice, and even articulation, and might from that circumstance be probably a species of the parrot. The philosophers noted all this, and doubtless made a proper use of the particulars, in determining the genus of the animal. For the last thing that a virtuoso ought to question, is the truth of facts. It is by taking facts as granted, that an hypothesis is most easily established. The transactions of the Society have not been yet published. Nevertheless we have been favoured with the report of the members on this occasion, with leave to publish it, having so immediate a relation to this work. It is as follows: “The animal of which an account is now to be given, was asleep when we made our visit; and the keepers were unwilling to disturb him, having been kept awake, they said, too much for some time past, by the frequency of people coming to see him. However, this circumstance gave us an opportunity which we would not otherwise have had, of observing him while while asleep. He lay with his head upon his right shoulder, and his hinder legs, drawn up to his belly, in the manner of the dog, or bear. The drawing his breath, and his snoring, is that of a man. He has hair upon his head, with a mixture of feathers; but upon his body there is nothing but feathers, not in the manner of other fowls, if fowl this may be called, smooth and clean, but growing through a viscous substance resembling tar, and intermixed with it; in this particular differing from the bird kind in general, who by means of a spinal gland secrete an oily substance, with which they besmear and dress their feathers; for here the oily or viscous substance is itself mixed with the feathers, and oozing from the skin. Nor are the feathers here, as in fowls in general, lying all one way, but in various directions, as if nature had given them to sprout out at random. But what is most extraordinary, the stems are frequently protruded, and the downy part inserted in the skin. Such were our observations while he lay asleep. After half an hour the keepers having awaked him, he got up from his straw by turning on his back, stretching out his fore fore legs, or wings, if they may be so called, raising himself on his rump, and then by resting on one paw, rising with a slow and easy motion, to his feet. It may seem a catachresis in language to talk of the face of a beast; nevertheless we shall use this phrase, for though in great part covered with feathers, and the same viscous matter with the body, yet in shape it has the appearance of a human face, full as much or more, than the baboon, or others of the ape species. It cannot be said to laugh, but rather grin, though once or twice in our presence, you would have thought that it exhibited a dilatation of the oscular muscles, as if attempting to laugh. The eye is of a grey colour, and the look wild, but steady, like that of a person under an impression of amazement and wonder. The neck, and whole form of the body, and even the hinder legs, have a strong resemblance of the human. Were it not for the feathers, a person on a superficial view might mistake the wings for arms, being attached to the body by a shoulder blade, and the claws resembling the fingers of a Negro. If this animal is to be referred to the quadruped, or beast kind, it would most natur- naturally be classed with the Ouran Outang, or Wild Man of Africa: If with the bird kind, we shall be totally at a loss to assign the genus. For though it has a head and face not unlike the ouzel, or the grey owl, yet in the body it has no resemblance. Nevertheless we should certainly give it a place amongst fowls, were it not that it has ribs instead of the lamina, or side plates, which are peculiar to the winged race alone: as also, because we have reason to think it has an epiglottis, from the articulation of its sounds, by which it has come to imitate our speech, with a pronunciation not unlike that kind of brogue, which we remark in some of the west country Irish. It appears to want the ingluvies or craw; but has a gizzard, and digests its food by the dissolving power of the gastric juices. All things considered, we incline to think that it is an animal of a species wholly new, and of a middle nature between a bird and a beast; yet so widely differing from a bat, as not to be classed with it. This discovery leads to new and important considerations. We do not undertake to decide for the Society; but shall venture to suggest some particulars.this This animal would seem to form the link between the brutal and the human species; being nearer to it in some particulars than the Ouran Outang itself; and especially in the evident articulation of certain sounds. Articulation was with the ancients, the distinguishing characteristic of the human kind. The poet Homer has the epither frequently, Meropon, Antbropon: articulate, speaking men. Yet we find from this discovery, that articulation, at least to some extent, is not peculiar to man alone. This is an incidental characteristic, given by the poet; but the distinguishing marks has been given with more subtilty of observation, by his scholar Aristotle, whose definition is that of Animal bipes implumis. A two legged, unfeathered animal: For though it might be contended with some plausibility, that this animal has two legs; yet it is evidently feathered; not indeed with the long and strong plumage of the ostrich, but with the down of a goose, or duck. This animal, like man, has not a tail. Nevertheless it has the os coccygis, or termination of the spinal bone, longer than in man; as was ascertained by one of us, who in the interval of his sleeping, felt his rump. Not that that we would draw from this any conclusion in favour of the hypothesis of Monboddo, that men had once tails; but that in the scate of animals, there is a gradual nearing of distance, from having long tails, to the having no tail at all. The most important enquiry comes now to be investigated, namely, whether this be an animal new to discovery, or actually new to the world, and just lately come into existence in the natural kingdom. No account of it having been heretofore given by any traveller in America, either from the information of the natives, or personal observation of their own, founds a strong presumption that it is of a novel breed of creatures; but that it is prepared to preserve its species, with a female, may be inferred, from the circumstance of nature having furnished it with testicles. The idea of original production, involves in it the late hypothesis of Macilhattan, in his treatise, De Seminibus, that nature has within herse f an aboriginal productive power; so that as some animals disappear from the earth, the Mammoth for instance, others spring up, that were never known before. Which hypothesis, by N by the bye, so far as respects the extinction of animals, receives considerable countenance from the ancient relations of the gorgon, the hydra, &amp;c. and the less remote allusions to winged gryphins, orchs, &amp;c. If this should be found to be the fact, it may be suggested whether it would be going too far to say, that it might be in the compass of human research, to discover the subtil combination of causes and effects, necessary to the production of life, and the formation of a living creature; and that the time might not be far distant, when ingenious chymists might undertake and accomplish the analysis of matter, and synthesis of composition, so as to be able to make animals, to those who should bespeak them; as a workman would make articles of furniture for a hall or assembly room. This would save much expence, in feeding, and providing them for food, or for the purposes of labour, and burdens. We have thought it sufficient to suggest this, and propose it to the industry and ingenuity of the learned in philosophic science.” So far the memoir. The society expressed their approbation of it; and it was proposed to make a purchase of this animal, for the purpose of ex- examining it more fully, in their own hall, and possibly of sending it to the societies abroad, for their examination also. This proposition was adopted, and the same members appointed to drive a bargain with the proprietors, for the subject of their shew. When the deputation came forward, and began to traffic with the keepers, proposing a purchase of the curiosity in their possession, the revenue officer, in the cage just by, raised what is called the Irish howl, in a most pitiable manner; recollecting what the Captain had told him, on a former occasion, with regard to the use to which they would apply him, when they should have him in their power. God love your shouls, my dear masters, said he, that have taken me in the wild woods. I care not sat you make o'd me, a wild baste, or a turky buzzard; or a fish o'd de varer, while I gat good mate to ate, and clean straw to ly down upon; but for the sake o'd de holy fathers, do not sell me to defe filosophers, that will cut me up as you would a dead cat, and put my skin upon a pitchfork, just to plase deir own fancies; rader let me stay where I am, and shew me to de good paple, dat gape gape and stare, but keep deir teeth in deir mouths, and luke foolish, but dont affer to bite. The philosophers assured him, that his apprehensions were without foundation; having not the least intention of diffecting, at least until he died a natural death. Doubtless, it might be an object, to ascertain from the internal structure of his body, to what genus or class of animals he might belong: nevertheless, they were persuaded, the society would content themselves, with the observations drawn from external structure, at least for some time. On this turning round to the proprietors, they resumed the conversation relative to a purchase; the supposed animal continuing to vociferate and roar horribly. In the mean time, the affair of this wild man, beast, bird, fish, or whatever it was, began to make a noise in the town; the people who had come to see it, being divided in opinion; some believing it to be a monster, or new animal in the creation; others disposed to be of opinion, and others confidently asserting, that it was a real man. Coming to the ear of the chief justice of the slate, it occured to him, that if a man, the the confining him in that manner was a restraint upon the liberty of the subject; and ought not to be permitted in a country where the laws govern. Accordingly, he had issued his writ of Habeas Corpus to the keepers, commanding them forthwith to bring before him, the animal in their possession, and to assign the cause of this detainer. The officer came forward at the moment the keepers were about to close the bargain with the philosophers, and shewed his writ. They were obliged to obey; and came forward with their charge before the chief justice and associate judges, in open court then sitting, alledging property in themselves by caption, and employing counsel to support this allegation. The court having assigned counsel to support the Habeas Corpus, the argument began: Counsellor Patch first. May it please your honours, I take this to be an animal in which there can be no property absolute or qualified, being fera natara, or of an untamed nature, such as a panther, or a buffalo; of which it is laid down no larceny can be committed, as not being the the subject of property. 4 Black. 235; referring for authorities to 1 Hal. P. C. 511. Fost N 2 Fost. 366. 1 Hawk. P. C. 94. Here counfeller Patch read the authorities. Councellor Catch in reply: But by the same authorities, it is laid down, that animals fera natura, or wild, when reclaimed, or confined, and may serve for food, may be the subject of property, as deer inclosed in a park, fish in a trunk, or pheasants or partridges in a mew. But is it conceded, that this animal can serve for food? rejoined counsellor Patch. The question to be considered in the first place, interrupted the chief justice, is whether this creature is of the brutal or the human kind. Speak to that point. Counsellor Scratch, as amicus curia observed, that this being a question of fact, was most properly determinable by a jury. Counsellor Patch thought not, as the trial by inspection in the case of infancy, which was within the province of the court, was analogous to this. The court were of opinion with counsellor Scratch, and proposed to the counsel for the thing in custody, to bring a writ de Homine Replegiando, or Replevin, for the body of a man, as the proper writ to bring the case before a jury; or that an issue might be made upon the return to the Habeas Corpus, by con- consent; and in that shape let it be tried. It was agreed; property pleaded, the issue made up, and the jury about to be impanelled. Counsellor Patch under the principle of an alien having a right to a jury de medietata lingua, demanded, that the jury should consist of one half beasts. Curia advifari vult, and in the mean time desired the counsel to search for precedents. No instance was found of the jury de medietata lingua, being carried so far as this, and the motion was overruled. The jury being now sworn, the counsel for the keepers, offered the two members of the Philosophical Society, who had examined him, to establish his brutality; this evidence was offered on the principle, that it was peculiarly within the province of their studies to ascertain a point of this nature, and were therefore the proper witnesses; as in a case within the custom of merchants, individuals of this occupation are usally called. According to the maxim of the civil law, Unicuique, in arte sua, perito credendum est. Exception to this evidence, that they were interested, having had an eye to the pur- purchase of this thing, and actually in negociation for it. The objection was overruled, as going to the credibility, not the competency. The witnesses were clear that this thing was not of the human race, though as to what class of brute animals it was to be referred, they were not yet prepared to decide. To the weight of this evidence counsellor Catch opposed the evidence of nature herself; the thing had a human voice and speech, that of a west country Irishman; no instance of which was to be found in any natural historian that had ever written. He would call upon the gentleman to produce any authority to that effect. Counsellor Patch, was not prepared with an authority to prove, that beasts had been found that could speak Irish; but that it was no uncommon thing in early ages, and in many countries, for beasts to speak fome language; such as Latin, Greek; for which he might refer the gentleman to the AesopiFabulae, or those of Phedrus; nor was he without an authority at hand, to prove that even in more modern times, there were many beasts who could speak Englis; this authority was that well known book, book, The History of Reynard the Fox; which he now produced, and from which he read passages. The court thought the authority in point, and the evidence not to be got over, and directed the jury to find accordingly; which they did, in favour of the keepers, and the Habeas Corpus, was dismissed, and the thing remanded to custody. The members after this, struck a bargain the more easily with the keepers; as they had been a good deal alarmed at the risk they had run of having this property taken from them. The Society after having retained the curiosity a year or so, and ascertained its structure and properties, proposed sending it to some of the foreign societies, who had expressed a with to have a an occural examination of it also. The preference was given to the societies of France; and it was accordingly shipped in a brig of Blair M`Clenachen, that was bound to Nantz. At this place on coming ashore, the cage, by rolling and tubling in it, having worn off the tar and feathers from his back-side, he was mistaken for a sans culotte; and the mob rising, broke the inclosure, and let him out. I have not heard on, and he was greatly obnoxious with the army and judiciary. When the troops had attained the point of destination, and the judicial examinations had been set on foot with regard to the conduct of individuals, it was always a principal question, What do you know of Captain Farrago? They had heard of his man Duncan, and thinking that he must be acquainted with the secrets of the Captain, orders were given to apprehend him, under the idea of a criminal. The examinations were conducted with great dispatch, many hands making light work, there being a vast number of assistant interrogators, and deposition-takers, in the capacity of journeymen, and apprentices. It was a good school for students of the law, and young clerks who came out on the expedition. It is true, they were not very capable of taking the true sense of what was stated in the testimony, nor very careful to take down for and against; but the giving them a habit of asking questions, and spelling words, was of more consequence to the public, than the doing justice to people that had lived in a remote corner of the commonwealth. Duncan having been arrested, was put un- under guard with several others. When he came to his examination, he was asked the following question, and made the following answers: Are you aquainted with John Farrago? I hae a short acquaintance since I hae been in his service, about a month or twa. Has he ever conversed with you on the subject of politics? He wad na converse wi' me, he kens I dinna understand them. Do you not know him to be an insurgent? Indeed I dinna ken ony sik a thing. I believe he is no just vera right in the head, but I dinna believe he tuk any part in stirring up the insurrection. He has gane about the kintra for some time past, in an odd way, wi' ane Teague O'Regan, an Irishman, that got to be a gauger, and came out to this kintra, to set up in the business, and made a' this broil; and since he parted wi' him, he has employed me in the like capacity, no much to my profit, if I am pursued, and put in fear o' my life, and to hide three weeks in a glen for fear o' the mob, and now to be hanged for hanged ha'ing been in the kintra; and what is mare, to be made a witness against the Captain, when I hae nathing to say o' him. The deel tak me, gin I swear a word to wrang my conscience. That is the the short and the lang o' it. Sae ye need say na mare about it, but gae to the examination o' some other body, for U hae told ye a' that I hae to say about it. Duncan was dismissed, and the Captain himself; and falling into the hands of an assistant examiner of sense, his account and explanation was understood, and he acquitted from the suspicion of having swerved from the duty of a good citizen. Setting out after this with Duncan, he returned to his home; having experienced a number of incidents, and some danger in his travels, sufficient for one ramble. FINIS</field>
