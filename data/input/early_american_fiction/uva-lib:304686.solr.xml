      <field name="fulltext">INTRODUCTORY. It was a source of wonder to the sarcastic Beatrice, that the gentleman would still be talking when no one marked him; and, in these rapid days, an intrusion in the shape of a preface, even if that which is to follow were regarded as entitled to such formality, is to encounter the risk of speaking without the compliment of a listener. Whatever be the fate of his book, the writer may feel tolerably sure that introductory remarks, on his part, whether he affects humility, or takes credit to himself, are not likely to attract attention. But, since it is the custom to endeavour to say something on these interesting occasions, when there often is nothing to be said—in the way of civility, perhaps, to greet the welcome reader as he turns the page—it will probably suffice to intimate that, like causes having like effects, the motive for publication in this instance is much the same that leads to a similar result in the generality of cases. However confined our sphere, or lowly our ambition, it is a natural wish not to be passed over and forgotten altogether; and, a previous volume of sketches having had the good fortune to be received with favour, it affords encouragement to the collection now offered. It may be as well to state that a portion of the trifles thus included, never appeared before, and that the other sketches were published at intervals during the last year or two, in various periodicals of the day. Under a suggestion that it would be acceptable, if they were brought together in a less ephemeral shape, the deed has been done; whether prudently or not, remains to be seen. Something might probably be urged, as a palliating plea for these multiplied offences, relative to the hurried and disadvantageous circumstances under which they were perpetrated; but, as an appeal of this sort cannot well avail, when the sin is voluntary and with malice aforethought, it may be wise not to offer it in extenuation, leaving “Peter Ploddy” and his attendant culprits to the fate they are thought to merit. If condemnation is to fall on them, it will be a lesson for the future. If not, we shall cheerfully acquiesce in the justice of the sentence, and ever cherish it as a proof of sagacity and judgment in those who sit upon the bench.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">1* PETER PLODDY, AND OTHER ODDITIES. PETER PLODDY'S DREAM. Let no one be unjust to Ploddy—to Peter Ploddy, once “young man” to Mr. Figgs, the grocer, and now junior partner of the flourishing firm of Figgs and Ploddy. Though addicted a little to complaint, and apt to institute comparisons unfavourable to himself, it would be a harsh judgment to set him down as ever having been envious, in the worst sense of the word. It is true, no doubt, that at the period of his life concerning which we are now called upon to speak, a certain degree of discontent with his own position occasionally embittered his reflections; but he had no wish to deprive others of the advantage they possessed, nor did he hate them on the score of their supposed superiority. It was not his inclination to drag men down, let them be situated as loftily as they might; and whatever of vexation or perplexity he experienced in contemplating their elevation, arose altogether from the fact that he could not clearly understand why he should not be up there too. It was not productive of pleasurable sensations to Ploddy, to see folks splashed who were more elegantly attired than himself. He never laughed from a window over the disastrous results of a sudden shower; nor could he find it in his heart to hope it would rain when his neighbours set gayly forth on a rural excursion. It is a question, indeed, whether it had been a source of satisfaction to him to see any one's name on a list of bankrupts. The sheriff's advertisements of property “seized and taken in execution,” were never conned over with delight by Peter Ploddy; and when the entertainments given in his section of the town were as splendid as luxury and profusion could make them, it was yet possible for Peter to turn in his bed at the sound of the music and of the merriment, without a snarl about “there you go,” and without a hint that there are headaches in store for the gentlemen, with a sufficient variety of coughs and colds for the ladies. He never said, because an invitation had not been addressed to Ploddy, that affairs of this sort make work for the doctors. It will be observed then, that Peter was not of a cynical turn. Neither did he attempt to delude himself, as many do, into a belief that he despised the things which were denied to him. When his hands found an amplitude of room in empty pockets, he was candid to himself, and wished them better filled, instead of vainly endeavouring to exalt poverty above riches. When Thompson married wealth, or Johnson espoused beauty, it was no part of Peter's philosophy to think that extravagant habits might neutralize the one, and that the love of admiration could render the other rather a torment than a blessing. In short, Peter would have been pleased if both together had fallen to his share. Wealth and beauty might unite in Mrs. Peter Ploddy without causing consternation in his mind, and he confessed that the said Thompson and Johnson were lucky fellows. It being conceded that pedestrianism is a healthy exercise, and that being jumbled in an omnibus is a salutary impulse to the physical constitution, still Peter remained unshaken in the opinion, somewhat theoretical though it were, that a fine horse is not to be taken amiss, and that a smooth rolling carriage, however conducive to indolence it may be, is not an appendage to be altogether contemned. It is true, to be sure, that horses are often perilous to a rider's limbs, and it needs no demonstration at this late day to show that vehicular mischances are many; but Peter was willing to encounter the risk, and to exchange the toilsome security of going on foot for the dangers incident to more elevated conveyance. Haughtily as they might travel by, he never even indulged himself in a charitable hope that certain people might break their necks before they reached home, notwithstanding the quantity of dust thrown in his eyes. On such occasions, it was the habit with Peter to wipe his optics as carefully as possible, as he wondered why it was not his lot to kick up a similar cloud, to the astonishment of some other Peter. Here lay the trouble. Why was not Peter Ploddy otherwise than he was, if not in circumstances, at least in personal attributes? Why was he environed by disadvantages, when the favours of nature and of fortune had been so profusely distributed around him—when almost everybody but himself had something to boast about or to make capital of?—There, for instance, was his young friend Smith, at the apothecary's, over the way—Smith was a wit and a mimic—Smith could imitate all sorts of things, from the uncorking of a bottle to the plaintive howl of an imprisoned dog—his “bumbly-bee” was equal to any thing of the sort to be heard among the clover blossoms or in the buckwheat field—his mosquito would render a sound sleeper uneasy, and he could perform a cat's concert so naturally that old Mr. Quiverton, who is nervous in his slumbers, has thus been made, more than once, to leap from his bed and dash his slippers into the yard, as he uttered imprecations upon the feline race in general and the apothecary's cats in particular. The gifted Smith! As a calf, too, he was magnificent. No one in town could bleat half so well. Why could not Ploddy have accomplishments like Smith? —accomplishments which are the instinct of genius, and not attainable by labour. For had not Ploddy tried the effect of practice? Had he not, in the solitude of his dormitory, devoted whole evenings to corking and uncorking a bottle, listening with all the ears he had to its peculiarities of expression—had he not given himself assiduously to the study of the “bumbly-bee”—endeavoured to analyze the vocalism of gallinippers, and whined industriously through successive hours? And with what result, as the reward of so much intensity of application and usefulness of labour? A request from Figgs to quit his infernal noise o' nights, without the least doubt on the part of that respectable gentleman that the said noise was Peter's work. He did not even desire him to abstain from imitations—he did not recognise imitation in the matter at all. He spoke only of noise, without the slightest zoological or entomological allusion. And as for Mrs. Figgs, when Peter wished to test his progress by an effort at the “cat's concert” in the open air, did not her night-cap appear at the window and think that Peter Ploddy— “you Pete”—had better go to bed than stand screeching there? She did not ask whether it was Pete—she did not say “'scat”—she knew it was Pete, in the dark. Yet Smith had never been so disparaged. He could pass for a cat, or for any thing he pleased. He had no difficulty in causing people to jump and to cry “get out!” And hence every one was proud of knowing Smith. It was equal to a free admission to the menagerie. Then there was Bill Baritone, at the dry-goods store. Bill sang delightfully, and was “invited out” every evening. A serenade was not regarded as complete without him. Nobody could be in greater demand than Bill Baritone, whose sentimental strains went to the heart of every young damsel. But when Peter Ploddy tried to sing, people stopped their ears—the neighbours sent in to know “what's the matter,” and the boys in the street were of opinion that something had “broke loose” —a species of compliment for which Peter had no great relish, especially as the droll Mr. Smith had woven the affair into a story, and gave prime imitations of his vocal efforts, which were described as a bunch of “keys,” and all sorts of “time,” past, present, and to come. Peter had bought several music books, and had gone so far as to ask the price of a guitar; but he soon abandoned the hope of competing with Baritone, though he continued to wish that he could sing—at least a little—just enough to enable his friends to discover what tune it was, or what tune it was meant to be. It is so discouraging to be obliged to tell them the name of it. Tom Quillet, who was reading law round the corner, how he could talk—how he did talk—how he could not be prevented from talking! Ploddy had not the shadow of a chance when Tom was present. In the first place, Ploddy was not very rapid in raking up an idea—it often took him a considerable time to find any thing to talk about, and to determine whether it was worth talking about, when he had found it; and then it was to be brushed up and dressed in words fit to go out. Tom Quillet, on the contrary, was a walking vocabulary, who sent forth his words to look for ideas, being but little particular whether they found them or not; and he was, therefore, fully entered upon a speech which scorned subjection to the “one hour rule,” before Ploddy had discovered a corner in his mind where a thought lay burrowing. Tom, in truth, used his friends as a target, and remorselessly practised elocution and oratory upon them on all occasions. He could talk Peter Ploddy right up, with the greatest ease. He was, in the comparison, like steam against sails. He could talk all round Peter—before, behind, and on every side. Ploddy was not voluble, and Quillet either brought down or scared away the game, while he was priming his gun to take sight at it. “Why can't I express myself like that everlasting Tom Quillet?” thought Ploddy, in petulance; “what he says don't often amount to much, to be sure, when you come to think of it, but it stretches over a deal of ground and hammers out broad and thin. A little goes a great way. I wonder if he ever heard anybody but himself say any thing? I wonder if he believes that any body but himself has a right to say any thing? How does he do when he goes to church, I'd like to know, and must sit still without contradicting or giving his notions on the subject? How does he manage to stop his confounded clack long enough to get asleep?— Should there ever be a Mrs. Tom Quillet, and should she ever happen to want to make an observation, which is very likely, she will die as certain as fate, of not being allowed to speak her mind. She'll die of a checked utterance and of a congestion of words. Her thoughts will be dammed up till she chokes with them. Tom will never give her a chance. He never gives me one—not half a one.” Quillet was a politician, and a rising youth upon the stump, whither Ploddy ventured not to follow him. His elocutionary failure in social life had closed the gate of his ambition in this respect, and he felt assured that to gain distinction by the power of tongue did not fall within the compass of possibility, so far as he was concerned. Still he thought it a great thing to be able to talk—to be the operator rather than the patient—the surgeon in preference to being the subject—a Quillet rather than a Ploddy—on the general principle which obtains in warfare, that the offensive is apt to be a surer game than the defensive, as it affords room for choice in the time and method of attack, whereas the other party is never safe, and must always be on the qui vive. All these dashing qualities, with others that might be named, which are placed first in order as coming first in Ploddy's estimation, could perhaps have been dispensed with, had he been able to discover things in himself calculated to compensate for their absence. As a matter of immediate concern, he fell back upon his quiet common sense and sound unobtrusive judgment. We always think much of our common sense and sound judgment, when surpassed in more showy characteristics. Almost everybody has a wonderful degree of judgment—judgment more precious than other people's genius; and who is endowed with talent equal in value to our common sense? Like the rest of the world, Peter derived consolations from this source; but it was his youthful desire to be able to flash and glitter, if he could only discover the way to excel, or the line for which he was qualified. He had consumed no little time in fruitless efforts, musical, mimetic and otherwise, to acquire accomplishments which were impossibilities to him, as has happened and will continue to happen in more cases than that of Mr. Peter Ploddy, and he had encountered both toil and disappointment to convince himself of disqualifications obvious from the first to every one except himself. But in giving up these, he sighed for others equally unattainable. He saw that every man's life is a story, and that every man must perforce, and for want of a better, be the hero of his own story. Now, in examining the magazines, the nouvellettes, and the historiettes of the day, it will be discovered that heroes are always tall and generally valiant. Peter Ploddy was not much above five feet, and he resigned from the Thunderpump fire company because he had no fancy for riots, or for being hit over the head with brass trumpets and iron spanners. He never liked “games of that sort.” Heroes are graceful too! but Ploddy's dancing was not at all admired. It would have been strange if it had been. Heroes are handsome, moreover, with dark eyes, clustering curls and umbrageous whiskers. But the mirror insisted upon it to Ploddy that he was not handsome—verging rather in another direction—that his eyes were of a dubious lightness, his hair sandy, and his whiskers discontinuous, uncertain and sparse. He gazed sadly upon Mr. Daffodil Twod, the pretty man in the perfumery way and the fancy line. Sweet Mr. Twod!—with such loveliness, it is worth one's while to strap tight and to make costume a science. But Ploddy was not improvable into any resemblance, however remote, to the Narcissus family. Nor could he approximate otherwise to his impressive friend, Samson Hyde, the currier, who was wild and wonderful, at the corner of the street. Samson Hyde—what a martial figure he was gifted with—what mountains of chest, and what acres of shoulder. And his frown—so terrific. How Samson Hyde could fight—how he did fight, whenever opportunity occurred. “I wish I was Samson Hyde the currier,” ejaculated Ploddy, as he doubled his fists and endeavoured to scowl Dick, the shop-boy, into entire and utter annihilation. As Dick only asked whether Mr. Ploddy had got something in his eye, that he made such funny faces, Mr. Ploddy felt that the attempt to pulverize the boy by mesmerization was an undeniable failure—he felt at once, as he attempted to hide his confusion by adjusting a box of candles, that there was nothing fascinating in his qualities, picturesque in his appearance, or heroic in his composition—that he could not surpass the men, attract the women or confound the urchins—that he had not even the genius to make a fortune at a blow, like Mr. Headover Slapdash, the speculator, who rolled in wealth and built long rows of houses 2 —that he had no inward or outward gifts to afford success or prominence—undistinguished and undistinguishable Peter Ploddy, young man to Mr. Figgs, the grocer! In meditating upon the injustices of nature and the inequalities of fortune, Peter, even at his post of business, grew melancholy and abstracted. He sometimes sold salt for sugar, and sent people honey instead of oil, to fill their lamps and to illuminate their ways. Mr. Figgs found it necessary to take him aside and to “talk to him seriously,” which all who have chanced to be subjected to it know to be as unpleasant an operation as a young man can undergo and expect to survive. There is nothing worse than being “talked to seriously,” in an empty room, the door locked and no help at hand, though elderly gentlemen are so much addicted to it. Mrs. Figgs, however, with the gentleness peculiar to her sex, was not so cruel. She had not much faith in having persons “talked to,” and, besides, she was convinced that the young man must be crossed in love, as she had an exalted idea of the potency of the tender passion, particularly among those employed in the retail grocery business, which she regarded as calculated to increase the susceptibilities and to soften the heart. Figgs had been struck with her, and she had been struck with Figgs, under circumstances of this description, and it had ever since rendered her firm in the faith that a young woman, whether she be sent for soap, sugar or tea, is very likely to be smitten by the insinuating individual who waits upon her, and that the insinuating individual himself is in love all the time, and, for the most part, with a great many at a time. However this may be as a general rule, though not exactly applicable in the instance under discussion, it is nevertheless true that employments have their effect, somewhat in the manner suggested by Mrs. Figgs. Your baker's boy, for example, who serves customers of a morning—what a destroyer of hearts is he! what a concentration of coquettishness, as he goes flirting from door to door, distributing loaves of bread, words of love and seductive glances all over town. He is a dangerous fellow, that same baker's boy—none the less so because his experience is so extensive that his own heart is Cupid-proof, and is rarely, even in extreme cases, scratched deeper than his tally. “Peter's crossed in love,” repeated Mrs. Figgs, at the tea-table, in the little back room; “Peter's crossed in love. He snores so loud you can hear him all over the house, and that's a sure sign of being blighted in the affections and nipped in the bud, as a body may say. First, they snore, and then they borrow pistols, and buy clothes-lines, and fippenny-bits-worth's of corroding sublimity, done up in white paper, with the name pasted on the outside. It is actually shocking the cruelty of us women,” and Mrs. Figgs “wiped away a tear.” “I've heard Peter sythe by the hour,” observed Miss Priscilla Figgs, in corroboration of her mother. “Yes, my dear,” added Mrs. Figgs, “young gentlemen that have got the mitten, or young gentlemen who think they are going to get the mitten, always sythe. It makes 'em feel bad, poor innocent little things, and `then they heave a sythe,' as the song says. You should have heard your father when he was in a state of suspension about whether I was going to have him or not. Several people thought it was a porpus.” “Do porpusses get the mitten, ma?” interjected little Timothy Figgs, who was always on the search for information. “I didn't think fishes ever wore mittens.” “Pshaw, you're always talking about love and mittens and stuff, as if people had time for such nonsense now-a-days,” said Mr. Figgs, sternly. Figgs had survived his sentimental era, and grew impatient at any reminiscences of it. The reference to the “porpus” nettled him. “If Peter is crossed as you say, wait till we take an account of stock next week. That will cure him, I'll be bound. But the long and the short of it is, that if he keeps growing stupid, I'll send him adrift. I'm afraid he is beginning to read books and buys cheap publications. Reading books is enough to ruin anybody. There ought to be tee-total societies against it.” But Peter was not then in love, or, if he were he was not fully conscious of the fact; nor did he read books enough to do him material injury. His complaint was ambition. He wanted to be something, and he did not know what, which is an embarrassing situation of affairs —he cared not what—rich, handsome, wise, witty, eloquent, great upon the stump or fierce in regard to whisker—he would be a meteor, large or small—courted or feared—loved or envied—if not a cataract, at least a ripple on the wave,—more than Peter Ploddy had ever been or was like to be,—as funny as Smith, as musical as Baritone, as voluble and as impudent as Quillet, as pretty as Daffodil Twod, as big and as forocious as Samson Hyde, as wealthy as Headover Slapdash was reputed to be. It was one of those afternoons at the close of the month of June, which seem to have no end to them— when the sun, broad and blazing, appears to be unwilling to approach the horizon, and endeavours to make the night his own as well as the day—when the eye wearies of excess of light—when ice-creams are in their first flush of popularity and little boys paddle in the brook— when crops rejoice in green, while people swelter in white,—when nature clothes herself thickly in leaves, while the rest of the world divests itself of garments to as great an extent as the customs of society will permit. It was such an afternoon as this, and the Figgs family were abroad for recreation. Dick, the boy, was out on an errand, trying how many hours could be consumed in a transit from one given point to another. Peter Ploddy was alone in the shop, labouring under a suspicion that customers must have departed this life, and that buying things had become an “obsolete idea”—so he availed himself of the opportunity and of a friction match, to find recreation in the smoking of a segar. Reclining upon coffee bags, he puffed and he mused, he mused and he puffed, until the smoke circled around him in lazy clouds, and his brain grew as hazy as the atmosphere. Light faded, sounds melted indistinctly away, and, at last, Peter imagined that he was rapidly travelling over the gulf of time, using his coming years for stepping stones, and anticipating the occurrences of the future, as if he were turning over the pages of a book of prints. The beginning and the end were equally within his ken, and, fixing himself at a point some eight or ten years after date, it struck him that he would like to know where “funny Smith” might chance to be at that period. The place certainly had somewhat the appearance of a theatre; but of a theatre in a very small way—of a theatre in a consumption, and troubled with a difficulty of breathing. The room itself was not very large, but it was much too large for the audience, who disposed of themselves in various picturesque positions, as if desirous of making up in effect what they wanted in numbers. One individual had his pedal extremities on the bench before him, and looked, as it were, from a rest, his elbows placed upon his knees, while his chin reposed in the palms of his hands. Another was longitudinally extended, with his back against the wall; while others intersected at least three benches in their desire for repose, lifting their heads at intervals to see what was going on. 2* The gentleman in the window seemed to be as comfortable as any, in his zigzag attitude, with his feet on one side and his shoulders on the other; and he had the advantage too of seeing all that occurred, both inside and out, as was evident from his frequent remonstrances with certain juveniles in the street, who were poking him with a stick because he obstructed their view. “Git down, I tell you!” cried Zigzag, impatiently, every now and then. The candles were few and ghastly; a single fiddle comprised the strength of the orchestra, and it was quite enough; for had there been more of the same sort, it would have been a questionable experiment upon the limits of auricular endurance. Ploddy paid his entrance money to a faded-looking woman, with one disconsolate child in her arms, and several others, equally forlorn and unkempt, hanging about her, while she herself, who, in her own person, united the offices of treasurer, check-taker and policeman, (in which latter capacity she often visited the window aforesaid, to aid Mr. Zigzag in making them “git down” on the outside,) was a singular compound of the remains of beauty, of the slattern and of the virago— care-worn indeed, but theatrical still, like the odd volume of a romance, thumbed to tatters in the kitchen. A performer was sustaining the regular drama by a series of “barn-yard imitations,” which struck Ploddy's ear as familiar, as also seemed the figure of the imitator, though his hollow cheeks, painted face and flaxen wig set recognition for a moment at defiance. The well-known finale of the “cat's concert,” however, dissipated doubt. It was Smith—the funny Smith—the envied Smith, who soon came round to “the front” to hold the baby and mind the door, while Mrs. Smith delighted the audience with a fancy dance. His countenance told a sad tale of disappointment, poverty and suffering, and rendered explanation unnecessary. “It is just as well,” thought Ploddy, as he slipped sadly away, “that I never could succeed in being a funny fellow, and made so poor a business of it at the cat's concert, and at imitating the bottle and the cork. This trying to make people laugh every night, from year to year, especially when their mouths are full of gingerbread, wouldn't do for me, and doesn't seem to do for Smith. I'd rather be Ploddy than Smith, if that's the way it's to be.” As Peter went meditating along, musing upon the melancholy situation to which funny apothecaries, who think more of creating merriment than of wielding the pestle, may be reduced, he found himself, at the small hours of the night, in the streets of the city. He was startled by the sound of rattles, and almost overthrown by a rush of tipsy and uproarious gentlemen, who battled the watch, and would have battled also with Peter, but that he secured a birds-eye view of the scene from a lofty flight of steps. Mars proved false to Bacchus, and victory perched like an eagle upon the banner of the functionaries. “Well, bang my kerkus for a drum,” panted Dogberry, “if this 'ere isn't that 'ere singing chap agin. I knows him by his mulberry nose. He's on a shindy somewhere or other every night, and gets knock'd down and tuck'd up three times a week, rig'ler. Old Calico, his daddy-in-law, has turned him out—couldn't stand it no longer, no how it could be fixed; he got so blue and blew it out so strong. He's a musical genus, you see.” “The corporation should make a contract for ketching him by the month, or else they should keep him ketch'd all the time,” replied Verges. “Put the genus in a wheelbarrow,” exclaimed Dogberry, in tones of command, “and make the t'other fellers walk.” A shade of doubt passed over Peter's mind as to whether the gifts of Bill Baritone had really, and in the long run, proved of benefit to him, and whether it was desirable, after all, to enjoy that degree of popularity which causes a youth to be “invited out” to convivialities every evening. It was a distinction, perhaps, but Peter did not exactly like the order to “put the genus in the wheelbarrow.” “But I must go to Quillet,” said Peter, “and ask him to talk the police people over in the morning, to get poor Bill out of his troubles.” Quillet, however, had exhaled and evaporated. The places that had known him, now knew him no more— no Quillet at the ward meetings—no Quillet on the stump. His talking abilities had converted him at last into a mere hanger-on of party—he neglected clients, and clients returned the compliment by being equally neglectful of him. People praised him that he might do the work necessary for political triumph; but when that was accomplished, it so happened always, that somebody else reaped the advantage. “Good fellow, Quillet,” said they, “but not popular—obnoxious—too much before the public. Can't recommend him, you know. Habits not very good—doesn't attend to his business—oughtn't to go to so many meetings;” and the unlucky Quillet was finally starved out, to do his talking elsewhere. And the pretty man, in the fancy line, Mr. Twod—what disposition had these years made of him? He had dressed so well and lounged so much in the resorts of fashion, by way of showing what nature and the tailor had done for him, that in the end “Twod's Perfumery” was disposed of at public sale, without the slightest regard to his feelings on the subject; and some remorseless stripling, whose face must have been as hard as the contents of his bosom, had disfigured the door by a chalked inscription to the effect that “Pretty Mr. Twod is now safe in quod.” “A face is not always a fortune,” inferred Peter; “there are decided differences between being useful and being ornamental;” and he had his own notions on another subject, when he became impressed with a belief that Samson Hyde, the currier, had disappeared suddenly, to avoid the consequences of a fatal fray, in which he was deeply implicated. Broad shoulders and alarming whiskers were sinking below par—a man may have too much spirit. Ploddy was not sure, but it struck him that the barkeeper at the Spread Eagle had a marvellous resemblance to Mr. Headover Slapdash, the speculator,—a little older, but yet as restless as ever. What had possibly become of his equipages, his magnificent mansion in town, his beautiful retreat in the country, his long rows of houses, and his immense accumulation of lots? Gone! Could it be? There was nothing more likely. “How different things seem to be in the end, from what they promise to be in the beginning,” muttered Peter, as he moved uneasily upon the coffee-bags. “Strange, strange, very strange,” and his foot dislodged a demijohn from its perch. The crash aroused him from slumbers and dreams, and he sprang to his feet in bewilderment. “Headover Slapdash has exploded—didn't you hear the smash?” shouted Peter. “Crossed in love, poor thing,” said Mrs. Figgs, as she rummaged for her sympathizing pocket-handkerchief. “Who crossed him, I'd like to know?” cried Priscilla, with a twinge of jealousy. “He's becoming foolish,” added Figgs. “He's been asleep, and has had an inkeybus,” observed the youthful Timothy, whose bias was in a scientific direction. But Peter was rejoicing that it was only in his imagination that his friends had suffered,—that however real and however probable the whole matter appeared, it was still no more than a dream. There were hints in it, notwithstanding, which might be rendered useful, not to himself only, but to the other parties concerned. Peter was sure, at all events, that he had learned something about contentment with his position, with his faculties and with his physical endowments, which he had never acquired before, although he stood greatly in need of it. He had, in half an hour or so, anticipated the trying experiences of years, and saw that every condition has its compensations—that the higher the elevation, the more imminent the danger of a fall—that brilliancy may betray to ruin, and that successes are often lures to destruction. Humbleness looked by no means so despicable as he had previously considered it. “Tol de rol!” said Ploddy. “You can't sing, Peter,” remarked Mrs. Ploddy. “I'm glad of it,” returned Ploddy, thinking of “genus” on the wheelbarrow; “I'll mind my business all the better.” It was to this observation, coupled with a confirmatory change in his general business deportment, that Peter eventually was indebted for his position as a member of the firm of “Figgs and Ploddy,” and a very prosperous, respectable, and wealthy firm it came to be, owing in part to Peter's dream, which also gained him the reputation of being a philosopher, in secretly furnishing the material for wise discourses upon the folly of inordinate ambition and vain desires. There was, however, another event in Peter's life which deserves to be chronicled as important. It was evident that there was something on his mind as he fidgetted before the glass—an unusual event with him —and he rumpled his hair in all directions. “It's labour thrown away, Peter—you can't make yourself handsome,” hinted Priscilla Figgs, rather maliciously, as she glanced over her sewing. But Peter had not been studying himself in the mirror. His eyes were on the reflected image of Miss Priscilla Figgs, who was by no means a disagreeable object. Ploddy had too much taste to look at himself when she was near. “Ha! ha!—ho! ho!—I know it,” said Peter; “I've had a lucky escape.” “Not a very narrow one, I'm sure,” replied Priscilla, tossing her head, “whatever Sally Jones may think.” “Sally who?” “Sally Jones,” responded Priscilla, poutingly. She appeared uncommonly pretty at that moment, and Peter had a sensation. “Now, Priscilla!” “Now Peter, you know—” “I don't—I don't know,” and Peter drew nearer to the damsel, whose head was turned coquettishly away, but not far enough to prevent her downward glance from noting the progress of the approach. What explanations were made relative to Sally Jones, the historian saith not; but the inference is that they were satisfactory. “Peter, Peter, there's ma!” cried Miss Priscilla Figgs as she flew to the opposite side of the room, assuming a look of intense demureness, which was perhaps a little overacted, if not also a little contradicted by the mantling colour of her cheek and the dewy softness of her eyes. “Let her come,” said Peter, with delight, “all the ma's there are, and pa into the bargain.” Figgs had no objection to Peter as a son-in-law, now that he had “got over his foolishness,” and was so strict in his attention to business, and “ma” was charmed to think that her theory of the tender passion in reference to grocers, had been so happily illustrated, the more especially as she had somewhat risked her reputation upon it that Peter was in love. Smith, Baritone, Quillet, Twod and Samson Hyde were at the wedding, and you may be sure there was a merry party. Peter told them his dream as a bachelor's legacy of warning against the dangers to which they were individually exposed, and the effect was no doubt salutary. Certain it is, that Peter Ploddy heard the clever imitations, the funny stories, and the good songs—listened to Quillet's neat and appropriate speeches—saw the pretty man dance and the valiant man look heroic, without a shadow of discontent or envy, satisfied to be, in every particular, as he was and as he was like to be. Priscilla was decidedly good-looking enough for both, and Peter Ploddy was a happy man.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE PRISON VAN; OR, THE BLACK MARIA.[1] [1] In Philadelphia, the prisons are remote from the Courts of Justice, and carriages, which, for obvious reasons, are of a peculiar construction, are used to convey criminals to and fro. The popular voice applies the name of “Black Maria” to each of these melancholy vehicles, and, by general consent, this is their distinguishing title. “Hush! there she comes!” It was a pleasant summer morning,—brightly shone the sun, and the neighbours gossipped at the door. Nancy polished the handles—Susan had the windows wide open, and, with handkerchief on head, leaned forth to join in the conversation. Mrs. Jenkins had been at market, and paused upon the step, with the provision-laden Polly. There was quite a discussion of the more agreeable points of domestic economy, and a slight seasoning of harmless scandal gave piquancy to the discourse. All were merry. Why, indeed, should they not be merry? Innocent hearts and balmy weather— sunshine within and sunshine without. No wonder their voices rang so cheerfully. Even Mr. Curmudgeon, over the way, that splenetic and supercritical bachelor, with no partner of his bosom but a flannel waistcoast, and with no objects of his tender care but the neuralgics and the rheumatics—even Mr. Curmudgeon chirped, and for once granted that it was a fine day, with no reservation whatever about the east wind, and without attempts to dash the general joy by casting forth suspicions that a storm was brewing. If he said so—if Mr. Curmudgeon confessed the fact—not a doubt can be entertained—it was a fine day beyond the reach of cavil—a day free from the reproach of a flaw—with no lingering dampness 3 from yesterday, and with no cloud casting its shadow before, prospective of sorrows to-morrow. In short, every thing looked warm, cheerful, and gay —the Nancies, the Pollies, and the Susans were prettier than usual—there are pretty days as well as lucky days— when cheeks are more glowing and eyes are more brilliant than on ordinary occasions—when Mrs. Jenkins is more pleasant than is the wont even of pleasant Mrs. Jenkins, and when the extensive brotherhood of the Curmudgeons pat children on the head, and give them pennies—days when one feels as if he were all heart, and were gifted with the capacity to fall in love with everybody—happy days! The day of which we speak was one of these days—nature smiled, and the people smiled in return. Nature approached as near to a laugh as was becoming in a matron at her time of life and with so large a family, while the people did laugh with the smallest provocation thereto. “Hush! there she comes!” said somebody, in tones of commingled fear and curiosity. “Who comes?” The finger of the speaker pointed steadfastly down the street. “Who comes?” “Black Maria!” was the half-whispered reply. Conversation ceased—a shade of gloom passed over every brow—all gazed in the direction indicated—it was a melancholy pause—a pause of sad attention. “Black Maria!” was the unconscious and involuntary response. The children looked behind them, as if to ascertain whether the doors were open for retreat into the recesses of home, and then peeped timidly and cautiously around the skirts of their mothers. The mirth of their seniors was also checked in mid career. “`Black Maria,' sissy,” said curly-headed Tom, and “sissy” clasped Tom's hand with the energy of apprehension. “`Black Maria,' Tom!” repeated his aunt, with an air of warning and admonition, at which Tom seemed to understand a whole history, and was abashed. “Black Maria!” Who was this strange creature—this Black Maria— that came like a cloud across the ruddy day—that chills the heart wherever she passes? What manner of thing is it which thus frowns gayety itself into silence?—Black Maria!—Is she some dark enchantress, on whese swart and sullen brow malignity sits enthroned?—or is pestilence abroad, tangible and apparent? The “Black Maria” goes lumbering by. It is but a wagon, after all—a wagon so mysteriously named—a wagon, however, which is itself alone—not one of the great family of carts, with general similitude and vast relationship, but an instrument of progression which has “no brother—is like no brother.” It creaks no salutation to wheeled cousins, as it wends its sulky way—it has no family ties to enable it to find kith and kin, more or less humble and more or less proud, in the long line of gradation, from the retiring wheelbarrow up to the haughty and obtrusive chariot. It is unique in form and purpose—it has a task which others are unfitted to encounter, and it asks no help in the discharge of duties. It moves scornfully among hacks and cabs, while even the dray appears to regard it with a compound feeling of dread and disdain. It is, as we may say, a vehicular outcast, hated but yet feared—grand, gloomy and peculiar—a Byron among less gifted but more moral carriages—tragedy amid the niceties of commonplace. Such is the social isolation of the “Black Maria.” Even in its hour of repose—in its stabular retreats, the gig caresses it not, nor does the carriole embrace it within its shafts. The respectability of the stalls shrinks from contact with the “Black Maria,” and its nights are passed in the open court-yard. Nor is it to be wondered at. The very physique of the “Black Maria” is repulsive, apart from the refinements of mere association. What is it—a coffin, rude but gigantic, travelling to and fro, between the undertaker and the sexton? Why is it that the eye fails to penetrate its dark recesses? No “sashes” adorn the person of the “Black Maria.” Unlike all other vehicles, it has no apertures for light and air, save those openings beneath the roof, from which a haggard and uneasy glance flashes forth at intervals, or from which protrudes a hand waving, as it were, a last farewell to all that gives delight to existence. Sternly and rigidly sits the guard in the rearward chamber, and beyond him is a door heavy with steel. It is no pleasure carriage then—it is not used as a means of recreation nor as a free-will conveyance, travelling at the guidance of those who rest within. No— they who take seats in the “Black Maria” feel no honour in their elevation—they ride neither for health nor amusement. They neither say “drive on,” nor designate the place of destination. If it were left to them, they would, in all likelihood, ask to be taken another way, and they would sooner trot on foot for ever, than to be thus raised above contact with mud and mire. They are not impatient either—they make no objection to the slowness of the gait. In short, they would like to get out and dismiss all cumbrous pomp and ceremonious attendance. But there are bars between—yes, bolts and bars, and there is nothing of complaisance on the brow of him who has these iron fastenings at control. Polite requests would be unheeded, and he has heard the curses of despair—the sobs of remorse—the bitter wailings of heart-broken wretchedness too often to be much moved by solicitations such as these. Nor is he to be shaken by the fierce regards of hardened recklessness. Even the homicide may threaten—red murder itself may glower upon him with its fevered glare; but there is neither weakness nor terror in the hard business-like deportment with which he silences the exuberance of lacerated feeling. He is but a check-taker at the door, and cares naught about the play within. Tears may fall—convulsive sorrow may rend the frame; but what is that to him whose limited service it is to watch and ward—to keep them in and keep them out? To weep is not his vocation, who sits at the door. He has no part in the drama, and is no more bound to suffer than they who snuff the candles for the stage. His emotions are for home consumption—his sympathies are elsewhere—left behind with his better coat and hat, and well it is so, or they would soon be torn to tatters—all—heart, cloth, and beaver. What, then, is this “Black Maria,” so jocularly named, yet so sad in its attributes? The progress of time brings new inventions—necessity leads to many deviations from the beaten track of custom, and the criminal, in earlier days dragged through crowded streets by the inexorable officers of the law, exposed to the scorn, derision or pity, as the case might be, of every spectator, now finds a preliminary dungeon awaiting him at the very portals of justice—a locomotive cell—a penitentiary upon wheels. He is incarcerated in advance, and he begins his probationary term at the steps of the court-house. Once there was an interval: “Some space between the theatre and grave;” some breathing time from judge and jury to the jailer,— a space to be traversed, with the chances incident to a journey. Constables on foot are but flesh and blood, after all, and an adroit blow from a brawny thief has often laid them prostrate. A short quick evasion of the body 3* has extricated the collar from many a muscular grasp, and once it was a thing of not unfrequent occurrence that the rogue flew down the street, diving into all sorts of interminable alleys, while panting tipstaves “toiled after him in vain.” There were no cowardly, sneaking advantages taken then—enterprise was not cabined in a perambulating chicken-coop—valour had room to swing its elbow, and some opportunity to trip up the heels of the law. But as things are at present managed, a man is in prison as he traverses the city—in prison, with but a plank between him and the moving concourse of the free—in prison, while the horses start at the crack of the whip—in prison, as he whirls around the corner—in prison, yet moving from place to place—jolted in prison— perhaps upset in prison. He hears the voices of the people—the din of traffic—the clamours of trade—the very dogs run barking after him, and he is jarred by rough collisions; but still he is in prison—more painfully in prison, by the bitterness of intruding contrast, than if he were immured beyond all reach of exterior sound; and when the huge gates of his place of destination creak upon their hinges, to the harsh rattling of the keeper's key, the captive, it may be, rejoices that the busy world is no longer about him, mocking his wretchedness with its cheerful hum. If it were in accordance with the spirit of the age to refine upon punishment and to seek aggravation for misery, the “Black Maria” would perhaps furnish a hint that the pang might be rendered sharper, by secluding the felon from liberty by the most minute interval—that freedom might be heard, yet not seen—as the music of the ball-room fitfully reaches the chamber of disease and suffering—that he might be in the deepest shadow, yet know that light is beaming close around him; in the centre of action, yet deprived of its excitements—isolated in the midst of multitudes—almost jostled by an invisible concourse—dead yet living—a sentient corpse. It is not then to be marvelled at that the “Black Maria” causes a sensation by her ominous presence— that labour rests from toil when the sound of her wheels is heard—that the youthful shrink and the old look sad, as she passes by. Nor is it strange that even when empty she is encircled by a curious but meditative crowd, scanning the horses with a degree of reverential attention which unofficial horses, though they were Barbary coursers or Andalusian steeds, might vainly hope to excite. The very harness is regarded with trepidation, and the driver is respectfully scrutinized from head to foot, as if he were something more or less than man; and if the guard does but carelessly move his foot, the throng give back lest they should unwittingly interfere with one who is looked upon as the ultimatum of criminal justice. Should the fatal entrance be left unclosed, see how the observant spectator manæuvres to obtain a knowledge of its interior, without approaching too closely, as if he laboured under an apprehension that the hungry creature would yawn and swallow him, as it has swallowed so many, body, boots, and reputation. Now, he walks slowly to the left hand, that he may become acquainted with every particular of the internal economy afforded by that point of view. Again, he diverges to the right, on another quest for information. Do not be surprised, if he were also to “squat,” and from that graceful posture glance upwards to ascertain the condition of the flooring, or sidle about to note the style of the lynch-pins. A mysterious interest envelopes the “Black Maria;” every feature about her receives its comment—she has not a lineament which is not honoured by a daily perusal from the public. She is the minister of justice—the great avenger—the receptacle into which crime is almost sure to fall, and as she conveys the prisoner to trial or bears him to the fulfilment of sentence, she is still the inspirer of terror. There may be some, no doubt—perhaps there may be many— who have forebodings at her approach, and tremble as she passes, with an anticipation of such a ride for themselves. Could upbraiding conscience come more fearfully than in this “Black Maria's” shape, or could the sleeping sinner have compunctious visitings more terrible than the dream in which he imagines himself handed into this penitential omnibus, as an atonement for past offences? What, let us ask, can be more appalling than the “Black Maria” of a guilty mind? It is a matter of regret that history must be the work of human hands—that the quill must be driven to preserve a record of the past, and that inanimate objects— cold, passionless, and impartial witnesses—are not gifted with memory and speech. Much has been done—a long array of successive centuries have fidgeted and fumed; but, after all, it is little we know of the action of those who have gone before. But if a jacket now were capable of talk, then there would be biography in earnest. We would all have our Boswells, better Boswells than Johnson's Boswell. A dilapidated coat might be the most venerable and impressive of moralists. Much could it recount of frailty, and the results of frailty, in those who have worn it; furnishing sermons more potent than the polished compositions of the closet. Could each house narrate what it has known of every occupant, human nature might be more thoroughly understood than it is at present. What beacons might not every apartment set up, to warn us from the folly which made ship-wreck of our predecessors! Even the mirror, while flattering vanity, could tell, an it would, how beauty, grown wild with its own excess, fell into premature decay. Ho! ho! how the old goblet would ring, as we drain the sparkling draught, to think of the many such scenes of roaring jollity it has witnessed, and of the multitude of just such jovial fellows as are now carousing, it has sent to rest before their time, under the pretence of making them merry! Wine, ho! let the bottle speak. Your bottle has its experiences—a decanter has seen the world. Thou tattered robe—once fine, but now decayed—nobility in ruins—how sourly thou smilest to discourse of the fall from drawing-rooms to pawn-brokers' recesses. What a history is thine—feeble art thou—very thin and threadbare; still thou hast seen more of weakness, ay, in men and women too, than is now displayed in thine own ruin. Yea, cobble those boots for sooterkin —they are agape, indeed; yet were once thought fit ornaments for the foot of fashion. Leathern patchwork, thou hast been in strange places in thy time, or we are much mistaken. Come, thy many mouths are open, and thy complexion scarce admits of blushing—tell us about thy furtive wanderings. Let then this “Black Maria” wag her tongue—for tongue she has, and something of the longest—and she would chatter fast enough, I warrant me. Let us regard her as a magazine of memoirs—a whole library of personal detail, and as her prisoners descend the steps, let us gather a leaf or two. Here comes one—a woman—traces of comeliness still linger even amid the more enduring marks of sin, poverty, and sorrow. Her story has been told before, in thousands of instances, and it will be told again and again and again. There is not much that is new in the downward career of those who fall. It is an old routine. Giddiness, folly, and deception, it may be, at the outset—remorse, misery, and early death, at the close. Yes, yes—the old father was humble in his ploddings—the mother had no aspirings above her sphere; but she who now is weeping bitter tears, she longed for silks and satins and gay company. It was but a cracked and crooked looking-glass that told her she was beautiful, but its pleasing tale was easily believed—for perfumed youths endorsed its truth, and whispered Fanny that she was worthy of a higher lot than that of toiling the humble wife of dingy labour. Those secret meetings—those long walks by moonlight—those stories of soft affection, and those brilliant hopes! Day by day home grew more distasteful—its recurring cares more wearying—the slightest rebuke more harsh, and Fanny fled. That home is desolate now. The old father is dead, the mother dependent upon charity, and the daughter is here, the companion of felons, if not a felon herself. Another!—that dogged look, man, scarcely hides the wretchedness within. You may, if it seems best before these idle starers, assume the mask of sullen fierceness. “Who cares,” is all well enough, indeed, but still the thought travels back to days of innocence and happiness. You set out in the pursuit of pleasure and enjoyment, but it has come to this at last; all your frolickings and drinkings—your feastings, your ridings, and your gamblings. You were trusted once, I hear—your wife and children were happy around you. But you were not content. There were chances to grow rich rapidly—to enjoy a luxurious ease all your life, and to compass these you were false to your trust. Shame and disgrace ensued; dissipation environed your footsteps, and more daring vice soon followed. It is a short step from the doings of the swindler to the desperate acts of the burglar or the counterfeiter. You, at least, have found it so. Well, glare sternly about you—turn upon the spectators with the bitter smile of defiance. It will be different anon, in hopeless solitude—the past strewed with the wreck of reputation—the future all sterility. Here is one who had a golden infancy. Where was there a child more beautiful than he? No wonder his parents thought no cost too great for his adornment. Who can be surprised that caresses were lavished upon the darling, and that his tender years knew no restraint. But it was a strange return in after time, that he should break his mother's heart—plunder his father, and become an outcast in the lowest haunts of vice. Were the graces of Apollo bestowed for such a purpose? This fellow, now, was destroyed by too much severity. His childhood was manacled by control. Innocent pleasures were denied—his slightest faults were roundly punished—there was no indulgence. He was to be scourged into a virtuous life, and, therefore, falsehood and deceit became habitual—yes, even before he knew they were falsehood and deceit; but that knowledge did not much startle him, when the alternative was a lie or the lash. Had the cords of authority been slackened a little, this man might have been saved; but while the process of whipping into goodness was going on, he paid a final visit to the treasury and disappeared. Being acquainted with no other principle of moral government than that of fear and coercion, he continues to practise upon it, and helps himself whenever the opportunity seems to present itself of doing so with no pressing danger of disagreeable consequences. Mistakes, of course, are incident to his mode of life. Blunders will occur, and, in this way, the gentleman has had the pleasure of several rides in the “Black Maria.” Here is an individual, who was a “good fellow,”— the prince of good fellows—a most excellent heart—so much heart, indeed, that it filled not only his bosom, but his head also, leaving scant room for other furniture. He never said “no” in his life, and invariably took advice when it came from the wrong quarter. He was always so much afraid that people would be offended, if he happened not to agree with them, that he forgot all about his own individual responsibility, and seemed to think that he was an appendage and nothing more. Dicky Facile, at one time, had a faint consciousness of the fact, when he had taken wine enough, and would say, “No, I thank you,” if requested to mend his draught. But if it were urged, “Pooh! nonsense! a little more won't hurt you,” he would reply, “Won't it, indeed?” and recollect nothing from that time till he woke next day in a fever. Dicky lent John his employer's cash, because he loved to accommodate; and finally obliged the same John by imitating his employer's signature, because John promised to make it all right in good time; but John was oblivious. The “Black Maria” has a voluminous budget,—she could talk all day without pausing to take breath. She could show how one of her passengers reached his seat by means of his vocal accomplishments, and went musically to destruction, like the swan—how another had such curly hair that admiration was the death of him—how another was so fond of being jolly that he never paused until he became sad—how another loved horses until they threw him, or had a taste for elevated associations until he fell by climbing—how easily, in fact, the excess of a virtue leads into a vice, so that generosity declines into wastefulness, spirit roughens into brutality, social tendencies melt into debauchery, and complaisance opens the road to crime. We are poor creatures all, at the best, and perhaps it would not be amiss to look into ourselves a little before we entertain hard thoughts of those who chance to ride in the “Black Maria;” for, as an ex-driver of that respectable caravan used to observe, “there are, I guess, about two sorts of people in this world—them that's found out, and them that ain't found out—them that gets into the `Black Maria,' and them that don't happen to be cotch'd. People that are cotch'd, has to ketch it, of course, or else how would the 'fishal folks—me and the judges and the lawyers— yes, and the chaps that make the laws and sell the law books—make out to get a livin'? But, on the general principle, this argufies nothin'. Being cotch'd makes no great difference, only in the looks of things; and it happens often enough, I guess, that the wirchis looking gentleman who turns up his nose at folks, when the constable's got 'em, is only wirchis because he hasn't been found out. That's my notion.” And not a bad notion either, most philosophic Swizzle, only for the fault of your class—a little too much of generalization. Your theory, perhaps, is too trenchant—too horizontal in its line of division. But it too often happens that the worst of people are not those who take the air in the “Black Maria.” Still, however, you that dwell in cities, let not this moral rumble by in vain. Wisdom follows on your footsteps, drawn by horses. Experience is wagoned through the streets, and though your temptations be many, while danger seems afar off, yet the catastrophe of your aberrations is prophetically before the eye, creaking and groaning on its four ungainly wheels. The very whip cracks a warning, and the whole vehicle displays itself as a travelling caution to all who are prone to sin. It is good for those who stand, to take heed lest they fall. But we have an addition here which should be even more impressive, in these times of stirring emulation. Take heed, lest in your haste to pluck the flowers of life without due labour in the field, you chance to encounter, not a fall alone, but such a ride as it has been our endeavour to describe—a ride in the “Black Maria.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">4 SLYDER DOWNEHYLLE. A SEARCH AFTER HAPPINESS. “How happy I'll be to-morrow!” exclaimed little Slyder Downehylle, in anticipation of Christmas; “oh, how happy I shall be to-morrow!” “Couldn't you contrive to be happy a little now?” replied Uncle John, who had learned somewhat to distrust anticipation and its gorgeous promises. “Happy now, Uncle John!” retorted little Slyder Downehylle, rather contemptuously, “happy now!—what with, I should like to know—what shall I be happy with —now? Where's the candy, the cakes, the pies— where is the hobby-horse that somebody's going to give me—and all the Christmas gifts? How I wish to-morrow had come—what a long day—what a long evening —what a great while I've got to sleep!” Little Slyder Downehylle became quite cross, and Uncle John whistled. Twenty-four hours afterwards, little Slyder Downehylle was still more cross—he had been happy with candy, with cakes and with pies, until he was very uncomfortable indeed; he had been happy with toys, until he had quarrelled with his little companions and strewed the room with broken playthings; he had been happy with his hobby-horse, until he got a fall. “Oh, what a stupid day!” said little Slyder Downehylle, “I wish to-morrow would come—I'll be so happy at Aunt Betsy's.” It is unnecessary to intrude at Aunt Betsy's, for the events there were of a character strongly resembling what had already occurred. Little Slyder Downehylle went to bed in tears. It was always so with the unfortunate Slyder Downehylle. Throughout life, he wanted something to be happy with; and strangely enough, it universally occurred that when he had obtained the thing, it did not prove to be exactly the thing he wanted. His expectations were never realized, and he was, therefore, constantly in a state of disappointment. Unlucky Slyder Downehylle! It was deplorable too that such should be the case, for Slyder Downehylle was anxious to be happy—he was always looking forward to be happy—for something “to be happy with.” He never got up in the morning but that it was his resolve to be happy in the afternoon—and, if not successful in accomplishing his purpose at that time, he endeavoured, as far as possible, to retrieve the failure by forming a similar determination for the evening. No one ever had a greater variety of schemes for living happy—very happy—than he; for living happy next week, for living happy next month, or next year; but it appeared to him that a malignant fate was sure to interfere, in order that his projects might be frustrated. At school, he was always thinking how happy he would be on Saturday afternoon; but then sometimes it rained on Saturday afternoon, or his companions would not do as he wished them to do on Saturday afternoon, or it may be that, although he had toiled hard for pleasure on Saturday afternoon, and the toil for pleasure is often the severest of work, he returned home weary, dispirited, and out of temper. Of course, it was unavoidable that his pleasure should be postponed until some other Saturday afternoon. And it was even so with the larger holidays. They never were exactly what they ought to have been—what they promised to be—what they seemed to be, when viewed from a distance. If Slyder Downehylle went afishing, why a treacherous bank would often give way, and then—pray, who can possibly be happy when dripping wet, with his clothes on? Nobody but poodles. What felicity is there in losing one's shoe in a swamp? Who is perfectly happy when scouring across the plain, like “swift Camilla,” with old Jenkins' big dog—that dog always bites—rustic dogs do—following close at his heels, widely opening a mouth which shows no need of the dentist? Then, if Slyder Downehylle went skating, it not unfrequently happened that he cried with cold, —what a strange arrangement it is not to have the best of skating on the warmest days! At other seasons, there was the sun. It never rains but it pours, in this world. Is it happiness, think ye, to have one's dear little nose— incipient Roman, or determined pug, as the case may be—all of a blister, and to have one's delectable countenance as red and as hot as a scarlet fever? “There's lime in the sack”—invariably, in Slyder Downehylle's sack—it would be easy to make mortar of it. The young Downehylle, finding that happiness eluded his grasp while a boy, made sure of throwing a noose over its head when he should be a man. What on earth is there to prevent a man's being happy, if he chooses— especially if a man has money, as was the case in the present instance, Uncle John and Aunt Betsy both being gathered to their fathers and mothers. May not a man do as he pleases?—go to bed when he pleases, and get up when he pleases?—eat what he pleases and drink what he pleases? A man is not compelled to learn lessons. All his afternoons are Saturday afternoons—his holidays last all the year round. Who would not be a man? “Oh, when I am a man!” said Slyder Downehylle. “I wish I was a man!” exclaimed Slyder Downehylle. “I want to be a man!” cried Slyder Downehylle, with impatience. Sooner or later, at least in the eye of the law, most boys become men, in despite of remonstrance. These boys are remarkable for an upstart tendency, and the Downehylles themselves are not exempt from the peculiarity. So Slyder Downehylle was a man at last, though, on the whole, it must be confessed that he did not derive the satisfaction from it that he had been led to expect. Slyder Downehylle was extended at full length upon a sofa. “I say, Spifflikens, what shall I be at? I'm twenty-one—I've got plenty of money—I'm as tired as thunder already—what shall I be at, Spifflikens?” “Lend me a hundred, and buy yourself a buggy,— why don't you get a buggy, to begin with?” “Yes, Spifflikens, I will. You're right—the Downehylles were always great on buggies, you know, Spifflikens.” It was Slyder Downehylle's theory, after this conversation—for he often theorized—that happiness was, to some degree, vehicular; that, like respectability, it was to be found in a gig, if it were to be found anywhere. He, therefore, bought him a sulky and a fast trotter—a mile in two minutes or thereabouts. What could escape a man who followed so rapidly? If you wish to be successful in the pursuit of happiness, do not forget to buy a sulky—there's nothing like a sulky. “Aha!—that's it!” muttered Slyder Downehylle, as he tugged at the reins, and went whizzing along the turnpike in a cloud of dust, passing every thing on the road, and carrying consternation among the pigs, the ducks, and the chickens. Slyder thought that this was “it” for several consecutive days; but as the novelty wore off—there's the rub— (that Hamlet was rather a sensible fellow—did he too keep a “fast trotter?”)—Slyder was not so sure whether it was the thing exactly, and on the recommendation of 4* his friend Spifflikens, who borrowed another hundred on the occasion, he endeavoured to improve it a little by drinking champagne and playing billiards at the “Cottage.” Fast trotters and champagne—fast trotters and billiards harmonize very well. Under this combination, Slyder appeared to think that “it” was considerably more like the thing than before. He had found “something to be happy with,” at last, and so had Spifflikens. It was not, however, so difficult to make Spiffy a happy man,—only allow him to go ahead, and say nothing about “returns.” He hates any thing sombre—any thing “dun.” “Now I'm happy,” said Slyder Downehylle, as he stood on the portico of the “Cottage,” and saw every eye fixed with admiration on his establishment, as the boy led his horse and sulky through the crowd of vehicles. “That's it, at last!” and he lighted another cigar and called for an additional bottle oficed champagne. “That's it, certainly,” remarked Spifflikens, at the explosion of the cork. Slyder Downehylle was perfectly satisfied that this was indeed “it,” for a considerable portion of the afternoon, and, to tell the truth, when he remounted his buggy, nodding his head to the bystanders, as he hung his coat-tails over the back of the vehicle, he was not a little “elevated.” “There—let him go!” said he, tossing a half-dollar to the hostler's deputy. Mr. Downehylle's sulky flew like lightning across the lawn. “Splendid!” ejaculated the spectators. “Superiaw—fine!” added Spifflikens. The dogs barked—the coloured gentlemen, who officiated as waiters, grinned from ear to ear.—There was quite a sensation at the “Cottage.” “That's it, at last!” said Slyder Downehylle, triumphantly. But he forgot that existence, short as it is, cannot be crowded all into the exhilarating moment of a “start.” Life is not to be distilled and condensed in this way, though his life seemed to come as near it as possible, on the occasion referred to. Why are we made ambitious? Why will we endeavour to jump over puddles that are too wide, when we so often miss immortality by no more than a hair's breadth? But “touch and go” is the secret of great enterprises. Slyder Downehylle was struck with a desire to sublimate the sublime—to “o'ertop old Pelion,” and old Pelion, as it was natural he should, resented the insult. Downehylle was allowed to “touch”—we often do that—but there was a veto on his “go.” He wished to shave the gate-post, in his curricular enthusiasm—to astonish the natives with his charioteering skill. Yet the poplars might have reminded him of Phaeton— of Phaeton's sisters weeping, lank and long. It certainly was the champagne—that last bottle, so well iced. Mr. Downehylle was out in his calculation by about the sixteenth part of an inch. He was on a lee-shore. A cloud of splinters went up and came down again. “There is but a Frenchman the more in France,” said a Bourbon on the Restoration. It was also quite evident that there was a sulky the less in existence. As this could not be considered the “fast trotter's” business— he having no further concern with the matter than to do a certain number of miles in a specific number of minutes—he, therefore, went straight on to fulfil his part of the contract, and it is to be presumed that he was successful, as nothing has been heard from him since. “That's not it, after all,” murmured Mr. Slyder Downehylle, as he was carried into the Cottage for surgical aid. The bystanders, lately so full of admiration, ungraciously placed their thumbs upon their noses, and waggled their fingers. Greatness always falls when it meets with an upset. “What could you expect from a fellow that holds his elbows so, when he drives?” was the general remark. When we are down, every one can see the reason why. The world is always full of sagacity, after the event.' Slyder Downehylle is known by the coloured waiters at the Cottage as “the gemplin that got spilt,” and he was so knocked down by the affair that he felt flat at the slightest allusion to it. He never hunted happiness in a buggy again, but went slowly home in the omnibus, and, though it did not enable him to journey very rapidly, he yet contrived, while in it, to arrive at the conclusion that, if “fast trotters” carried others to felicity, the mode of travel was too rough for him. He was puzzled. What could be the matter? He was a man, a man of cash—money in both pockets; but yet Slyder Downehylle was not happy—not particularly happy. On the contrary, striking an average, he was, for the most part, decidedly miserable. He yawned about all the morning; he was not hungry in the afternoon; he was seldom sleepy at night,—vexatious! “There's something I want,” thought Slyder Downehylle; “but what it is—that's more than I can tell; but it is something to be happy with. What other people get for the purpose, that they go grinning about so, hang me if I can discover.” Slyder Downehylle was rather good-looking, about these times—not decidedly “a love,” but well enough; and so, as nature had been propitious, he struck out in a new line— a very popular line—the hair line. He cultivated whiskers, “fringing the base of his countenance;” he set up a moustache; he starred his under lip with an imperial, and he balanced the superstructure with the classical “goatee.” Medusa herself never had more luxuriant curls. When Slyder Downehylle wanted to find himself, he was obliged to beat the bushes. He passed half the day with a brush in his hand, in adjusting his embellishments—in giving them the irresistible expression; and the rest of the time was consumed in carrying them up and down all manner of streets, and to all sorts of public places. Slyder Downehylle was now the envy of the young bloods about town, and was regarded as a perfect Cupidon by the ladies. How, indeed, could it be otherwise! Birnam Wood had come to Dunsinane—not a feature was discernible. Esau and Orson were shavelings and shavers to Slyder Downehylle. But, notwithstanding the fact that Samson found strength in his hair, Slyder was not so lucky. A thickset hedge cannot keep out ennui. It is true that the buffalo and the bison at the menagerie, took Mr. Slyder Downehylle for a patriarch of the tribe, fresh from the head waters of the Oregon; yet, after all, Slyder's spirit was nearly as bald of comfort as the “hairless horse”—that unfashionable quadruped. It must be confessed, however, that there were gleams of consolation attendant upon his bristly condition. The servants at the hotels styled him “mounsheer.” How delightful it is to be mistaken for what you are not! People thought he talked “pretty good English, considerin',” and, best of all, the little boys ran backwards that they might look with wonder at his face, while the smaller children went screaming into the house to call their mammas to see the “funny thing.” But “false is the light on glory's plume;” and it is no less false on glory's hair. Even the excitement of such enviable distinction as this soon wears away, and it may be questioned whether, barring the expense of soap, a furry-faced gentleman is, in the long run, much happier than the more sober citizen who has so little taste for the picturesque as to shave several times a week, and who is neither a “foundling of the forest” nor a perambulatory Moses, always among the bulrushes. Slyder Downehylle, therefore, reinforced his whiskers by an elaborate care in dress. He was padded into a model of symmetry; but, although the buckram was judiciously placed, he soon ascertained that this was not the kind of bolstering he wanted. The cotton made him warm, but it did not make him happy—not quite. It was “nothing to be thus,” unless one were “safely thus.” Slyder Downehylle began to feel small, when his muscular developments were hung upon the bed-post. Which was Slyder, in the main—he beneath the cover, or that larger part of him against the wall? He was tired of packing and unpacking; wearied with being “spectacular.” It was not exactly kind in Uncle John and Aunt Betsy—though they thought it was—thus to bequeath their savings to Slyder Downehylle. Their legacy perplexed him sadly. He discovered, in a very short time, that money is not in itself—notwithstanding the fact that it is generally known as the “one thing needful”—the material of happiness. But he was clear in his own mind that it was something to be got with money. Still, however, he could not find it—that “something to be happy with”—that cake, that candy, that sugar-ice, that hobby-horse. When his game was run down, why, it was only a fox after all. “Life's an imposition—a humbug,” said Slyder Downehylle, pettishly; “I've tried much of the fun that's said to be in it, and I'm beginning to have an idea it's a confounded stupid piece of business, when a man has seen it pretty much all through, like a farce at the theatre. I'm sure I don't know what to be at next. There's a man to be hung to-morrow; but I've seen two or three fellows hung, and they do it just alike. The fun is soon got out of that. Then there's to be a fight somewhere this afternoon; but what's a fight, or a race, or any thing, in short? A spree is to come off to-night at Crinkumcrankum's; but I suppose every thing's to travel down our throats in the old way—botheration!” “You should go it,” remarked Spifflikens, “go it strong—that's the way to scatter the blue devils: go it strong; and, as the poet judiciously remarks, `go it while you're young.' That's the time—lend me fifty, and I'll show you a thing or two—there are several things to be seen yet, by individuals who don't wear spectacles. This is good brandy, Slyder—prime brandy—where did it come from? Have you got any more? Brandy's wholesome. It agrees with almost everybody.” This postulate is not exactly so self-evident as Mr. Spifflikens thought it to be; but while it is not clearly proved that brandy agrees with everybody, yet it was plain enough that Spifflikens agreed with it, and Slyder Downehylle began likewise to have a slight agreement with that adjective, both in number and person. He followed the advice of Spifflikens. No one knew the world better than Spifflikens, and, therefore, Spifflikens must, of course, be right,—so Slyder Downehylle became convivial. He slept by day and he frolicked by night. If this was not the long-sought “it,” where could “it” be. Slyder Downehylle was merry—exceeding jocose. He was sometimes turned out of three theatres in one evening—he had fought in a ball-room—had thrashed several watchmen—had been honoured with “private hearings” by the magistracy, and had been more than once almost beaten to a jelly. Slyder Downehylle earned the right and title to be known as a spirited youth, and so he was, generally. But, by dint of repetition, the blue began to disappear from this plum also— the peach was no longer downy. If it had not been for the peach-brandy, what would have become of Slyder Downehylle? It was not, indeed, perfect bliss—Slyder was subject to headache in the earlier part of the day— but it was as nearly “something to be happy with,” as he had yet been enabled to discover. It was a hard case, view it as you will. Mr. Slyder Downehylle wanted to be happy—he had the greatest disposition to be happy. He had tried every possible experiment in that direction that either he or Spifflikens could suggest; but yet he was a dejected man, even when tipsy twice a day. He could find no delight that was of a substantial character—nothing to which he could constantly recur without fear of disappointment and disgust—nothing that would wear all the week through and be the same to-day, to-morrow, and the day after that. It was in vain that he intermingled his pleasures—took them in alternation—over-eat himself in the morning and over-drank himself in the evening, or reversed the process, turning the bill of fare upside down. It came all to the same thing in the end. There must be something wrong—why could not Slyder Downehylle be happy? Who laboured harder to boil down common-place and to extract from it the essence of felicity—to concentrate the soup of life, and to elicit essentials from their insipid dilution? A man laughed in the play-house—laughed several times. What right had he to laugh in that side-shaking manner? Slyder Downehylle could not laugh—he saw no particular joke that required it; but the man laughed again, and when Slyder requested him not to make a fool of himself, the man pulled Slyder's nose. Hope deferred engenders fierceness. Slyder quarrelled with the man about making so free with another person's nose, as if it were a bell-pull or a knocker. A nose is not much, to be sure—many noses are not—but when a nose is constituted a point of honour, it expands to the dimensions of a geographical promontory—it is peninsular—it is an independent territory, over which no one can be allowed to march, much less to make settlements upon it. Slyder Downehylle resolved to stand by his nose, and so he stood up to it, and a duel was the consequence—a duel, according to the barbarian custom of modern times, which was fought before breakfast. Who can be surprised that there is so much bad shooting extant on these interesting occasions? A gentleman, no matter how much of a gentleman he may be in proper hours, cannot reasonably be expected to be altogether a gentleman—altogether himself—at such an uncivilized time of day. A man may be valiant enough after nine o'clock—when he has had his coffee and muffins—he may be able to face a battery in the forenoon, and ready to lead a forlorn hope when he has dined comfortably; but to ask one to get up to be shot at, in the gray of the morning—in the midst of fogs and all sorts of chilly discomfort, his boots and his trowsers draggled with dew, and himself unsustained by a breakfast, why the whole thing is preposterous. No man can be valiant unless he is warm, and, as no man can be warm without his breakfast, it is a demonstrated fact that breakfast is itself valor, and that one may be frightened before breakfast, without the slightest disparagement to his character for courage. Master Barnardine was right when he refused to get up early to go to the gallows. There is a time for all things. But Slyder Downehylle was not more alarmed than was natural and proper—not more, probably, than his antagonist. “How do they come on?” said the surgeon to Goliah Bluff, who acted as Slyder's second. The fourth shot had been interchanged and no blood drawn. “As well as could be expected,” replied Goliah; “they are approximating— 5 the seconds don't have to dodge now, and the principals are not so likely as they were to shoot off their own toes. Practice makes perfect. Gentlemen, are you ready?— one, two, three!”—bang!—bang!—The man had winged Slyder, and both were glad—the one that it was safely over, so far as he was concerned, and the other that the affair was finished and no worse, so far as he was concerned. Further approximations might have been dangerous. But the result was a downright flying in the face of poetical justice, owing, no doubt, to the fact that poetical justice wisely lies abed till the last bell rings. But then, as Goliah Bluff announced to the parties belligerent, Slyder Downehylle was “satisfied,” and who else had a right to complain? His nose was the feature most interested, and it said nothing, “as nobody knows on”—for it was now a nose which, when regarded in its metaphysical and honourable aspect, notwithstanding its rubid tints, had not a stain upon its escutcheon. The bullet in its master's shoulder had been soapsuds to its reputation, and the duel had been brickdust to the lustre of its glory. Slyder Downehylle's nose actually “shone again,” brighter than ever. His arm, indeed, was in a sling—the same arm that had conveyed so many slings into him, to support him, comfort him, and keep him up; but his nose was self-sustained; it had been proved to be a feature not to be handled with impunity. But what are noses, after all—what are noses in the abstract—noses individually considered? Slyder, in the end, did not care much who pulled his nose, so they did it gently. He was engaged in solving a great moral problem. He left the longitude and the squaring of the circle to intellects of an inferior order. It was for him to determine whether it was possible to live upon the principal of one's health and capacities for enjoyment, without being restricted to such beggarly returns as the mere interest thereof. As for content—the “being happy with one's self,” as Uncle John expressed it—this was a very flat sort of happiness in Slyder Downehylle's estimation, if, indeed, he ever placed it in that category at all. It was by no means strong enough for the purpose. Happy upon water! “I'll trouble you for that pale brandy,” said Slyder Downehylle. He desired that his existence should be one vast bowl of champagne punch—an everlasting mince-pie—terrapins and turtle soup—glaciers of ice-cream and cataracts of cognac, sunned by frolic and fanned by the breeze of excitement,—a “perpetual spree.” There were to be no shady sides of the way in his resplendent world.—How many practical philosophers have failed in the same pursuit! Is the aurum potabile never to be discovered? Are we always to come down to the plain reality, at last? Downehylle could not endure the thought. “More cayenne, if you please.” “Have you ever tried faro?” whispered Spifflikens; “there's considerable fun at faro, when you are up to it.” Spifflikens passed the bottle. Slyder Downehylle had never tried faro, but he did try it, and thought that he rather liked it. In short, it improved upon acquaintance. At length, he had reached the ultima Thule. The “something to be happy with” had, to all appearance, been found. Redheiffer was but a goose. He knew not where to look for the “perpetual motion”—the everlast ing jog to the flagging spirit. But the top of our speed brings the end of the race. He who moves most rapidly, is the soonest at the close of his career. Faro is fickle, and Slyder Downehylle, in his zeal to pile enjoyment upon enjoyment—to be happy, if possible, with several things at a time—had unluckily a habit of not taking even his faro “plain;” he needed syrup also in that effervescing draught, and, as his head became warm, the “cool” amounts in his pockets melted away. Slyder Downehylle was a cashless man—his researches after felicity had not only proved unsuccessful, but had left him without the means of future progression. He was bemired, half-way—swamped, as it were, in sight of port. Even Spifflikens cut him dead. The tailors desired no more of his custom—his apartments at the hotel were wanted. The “credit system” was out of fashion. Financiering had been clipped in its wings. How doleful looks the candle when capped with an extinguisher!—The wounded squirrel drops from limb to limb. The world has many wounded squirrels, besides those that crack nuts to earn a living. Just such a squirrel was Slyder Downehylle, compelled, before he reached the top of his aspiring hopes, to abandon every step that he had so toilfully surmounted. How he now obtained any thing to eat, is not exactly known. His mode of obtaining something to drink, is, if not original, certainly ingenious. He never goes to the pump, having no taste for hydraulics. Nor does he find water with a hazel twig. He has a more effective “twig” than that. He lounges in bar-rooms, and, as his old acquaintances, searchers after happiness not yet brought up with a “round turn,” go there to drink—a dry bar is a sad impediment to navigation—it is astonishing how very solicitous he becomes in reference to their health. “How do you do, Mr. Jones? I've not had the pleasure of seeing you for a long time. How have you been?” “Pretty well, Downehylle, pretty well—but excuse me—Bibo and I are going to try something.” “Why, ah—thank you—I don't care much if I do join. The pale brandy—yes—that will answer,” would be Slyder Downehylle's response under such circumstances, from which it is apparent that misfortune had somewhat impaired his sense of hearing. Slyder Downehylle is supposed to be yet about town, looking earnestly for his undiscovered happiness. The last time he was seen by credible witnesses, they noted him busily employed in playing “All Fours,” in front of John Gin's hostelry—a game probably selected as emblematic of his now creeping condition. He lounges no more in fashionable resorts. Champagne punch is a mere reminiscence. His Havanas are converted into “long nines,” and his bibulations are at two cents a glass, making up in piperine pungency what they lack in delicacy of flavour. He is sadly emaciated, and, in all respects, considerably the worse for wear, while a hollow cough indicates that his physical capabilities have proved inadequate to the requirements of his method of employing life, and are fast dropping to pieces. Slyder Downehylle is consequently more melancholy than ever. He is troubled with doubts. Perhaps he may have proceeded upon an error—perhaps the principle, the high pressure principle, of his action was not the right one. It may be that excitement is not happiness—that our pleasures are fleeting in proportion to their intensity—that, indeed, if “life be a feast,” the amount of satisfaction to be derived from it is rather diminished than increased by swallowing the viands hastily, and by having a free recourse to condiments, and that a physical economy is as wise and as necessary to well-being as economy of any other kind. He is almost led to suppose that his “something to be happy with” is a fallacy; he never could hold it within 5* his grasp, and he inclines to the belief that a man probably does well to have a home in himself, that he may not always be compelled to run abroad for recreation, or to appeal to his senses to give vivacity to the hour. If it were his luck to begin again, perhaps he might try the tack thus indicated. But that hollow cough!—Our experiences oft reach their climax too late; yet others may learn from the example of Slyder Downehylle.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">HIGHDAYS AND HOLIDAYS. A CHRISTMAS FANCY, AND A NEW-YEAR'S THOUGHT. Undoubtedly—we never meant to deny it—anniversaries are pleasant enough, in their way. It is true, perhaps, that if our wishes could have an effect in the matter, we might rather desire them not to come quite so rapidly as they do of late, thus huddling on each other as if the space between had undergone abridgment, and as if years, like ourselves, as they grow older, are liable to shrinkage. There is no audible call for despatch in this particular, and thus to mount the months upon a locomotive, to sweep by in such undignified haste that they are gone almost before we are able to avail ourselves of their services,—which every one must have observed to be peculiarly the case since steam became the fashion and hurry the order of the day,—is annoying to people of leisurely habits, who like to deliberate before they act, and to consider consequences in advance of the deed, instead of afterwards, according to modern usages. To our fancy, the slow year—the year in hoop, powder and buckles—in full decorum and expansion—was a much more respectable personage than such years as we have now; years which have changed the minuet measure of their ancestors for a hop, step and jump, not to be set down as otherwise than an abomination. We hate to be jostled and pushed from our propriety, and though it is admitted to be true that “here to-day and gone to-morrow” is symbolical of human existence, this incessant bustle of preparation causes an absorption of the day in the morrow. There is no “to-day”—scarcely the fragment of an afternoon; nothing but beginnings and endings, without an intervening pause for thought. Still, however, as you say—as all the world says— these anniversaries are pleasant things; not emphatically pleasant, but pleasant, with no particular stress upon the word. They will intrude into our company, you know, without ceremonious observances. It is not easy to shut the door in the face of old time, nor is it of avail to reply “not at home,” to the New Year; and, in emergencies of this kind, when there is no help, we cannot probably do better than to insist upon it, downright—to ourselves and to other people of less importance, that the inevitable visitant is under our patronage, and has agreeable points about him. Marvels are to be accomplished in regard to such convictions, by dint of perseverance. Resolve upon it that you shall think so, and you will think so,— sooner or later. Only want to think so, and the object is more than half achieved. We are very docile to ourselves, and in an internal dispute, inclination is so fertile in argument that it becomes “useless to talk.” The fair lady at last confessed that John Wilkes had a squint—the aberration from the true line was too evident to be denied—but then, she had prevailed on herself to admire even his defects, and she qualified her unwilling admission by declaring that, to her view, “Mr. Wilkes did not squint more than a gentleman should.” And so, these anniversaries are pleasant things. There is a little of a sinister expression in their aspect, no doubt—father Saturn is charged with a disposition to devour his children— but we will set it down as a peculiarity which is rather attractive than otherwise—romantic interest, such as that which envelopes gentlemen of the “suspicious look,” who combine the bully and the beau in so just an equipoise, that they command success and enforce admiration. No one pretends to assert, at least, that it is not a source of pleasure to meet with friends, on a festive occasion—provided always that we have friends and possess a fondness for festivities. To give and to receive tokens of love and amity, affords refreshment to the spirit. The heart is cheered by smiling faces and the voice of joy, and it is not to be disputed that dining well is a circumstance by no means repugnant to the ordinary constitution of human nature—not repugnant at the moment, though sometimes apt to entail remorseful reminiscences. There is a period also, in our terrestrial career, when the dance comes not amiss, even if we should chance to feel a little dull upon it, when the next day's sun peeps in at us; and, indeed, it may be conceded that all the incidents of the holiday season and anniversary return—very nearly all— are decidedly pleasant—bright to anticipate, happy in fruition, and well enough in the retrospect. Let us, then, look gayly on the approach of the “happy New Year,” when we rejoice by tradition, and take up the echo of old time, that it may reverberate to posterity. Our merry-makings now, are the connecting link between the past and the future. We are told, moreover, that it is not the part of true wisdom to be strict in the analysis of our pleasures, and that he is more of a simpleton than a philosopher, who stops in the midst of his mirth to ascertain, by critical inquiry, whether, after all, there be any thing to laugh at. And, in fact, if it is our purpose to extract from life as many agreeable sensations as it is capable of affording, we must content ourselves with being entertained, and not insist too strenuously that the cause shall be in strict proportion to the effect. Nor can it be regarded as altogether a matter of sagacity to, pass much time in endeavouring to discover what we have to be unhappy about to-day. There are annoyances enough, of the unavoidable and intrusive sort—vexations which will, of their own impulse, be in attendance, independent of a call—without a recourse to the muster-roll of grievance, to select a pet sorrow as our special companion. And to search for a discomfort, merely to bring it in action as a means of self-disturbance, may be courageous, but it is, for the most part, an unprofitable exhibition of valour. There is abundant room for the exercise of the passive virtues, without this continued practice upon our fortitude.— Nevertheless, there are occasions when fevers of this peculiar type have their advantages; and when, from unknown causes, be they moral or physical, a diffused irascibility pervades the individual—when we go to rest in gloom and arise in sulkiness—it is a wholesome operation that the disorder should be localized, and that some particular point should be presented, no matter what, on which the pent-up fury may have vent. For example, if a gentleman, in the morning, should chance to be overheard in addressing harsh and uncivil words to his slippers, and in speaking with unkindness and disrespect to his boots, those with whom he is likely to come in contact at subsequent hours, have reason to rejoice that the superfluous electricity with which he was troubled, has wreaked itself upon inanimate objects. A living creature has, in all likelihood, had a fortunate escape. The slipper anticipates a contention—a boot may have frustrated a duel, and deprived surgery of a subject. Should my lady apostrophize the unlucky broom, which careless hands have left upon the stair, or should she, in sparkling monologue, comment on other oversights in housewifery, which meet her early eye, do not repine at wasted energy, or at eloquence scattered to the unheeding air. It is a mercy, though you think it not, and power remains for all needful purposes. Occurrences of this description are. however, but exceptions to the comprehensive rule, and are not to be elevated to the station of a general example. They are not to be pleaded, certainly, as a justification of undiscriminating cynicism, or as palliating the propensity to seek for faults and to spy out defects. But yet, as concerns holidays in general—as involves the merits of New Year's days and birth-days in particular—we are little disposed to be captious and hypercritical—but still it must be acknowledged, with all due deference to sounder judgment and more enlarged experience, that when they are regarded apart from their fineries, and the sophistication is dispensed with—when they lay aside hat, cloak and feathers—the comeliness, as in other instances not lying under present notice, measurably disappears, and as they sit down with us quietly by the fireside, it would be difficult perhaps conscientiously to assert, that the sensation is that of unmixed delight, or that the satisfaction would have been much less had their coming been delayed somewhat—not from a dearth of hospitality—not that we are altogether averse to this stranger presence; but from a vague impression that we are not fully prepared for such distinguished company, and would like to be a little more economical in joys of this description—not quite so many birth-days, and a thought less, if we may so express it, of the New Year. Let children be impatient—we can wait well enough; and though it be an axiom that time is money, we care not thus to exercise our arithmetic in its computation—like Hamlet, we are “ill at these numbers.”— The observant eye may have noted, too, that with its increase of chronological wealth, the world grows miserly in the accumulation of its anniversary amounts—that it hides them, as it were, in unnoticed crannies and disregarded chinks, and that, as the sum grows larger, it shrinks from every allusion to its doubtful riches, as if there were robbers here, to “steal our years away.” Nor can it have escaped intelligent remark, that there are those among us—respectable people, not incompetent to a gig, if, indeed, they may not justly aspire to a pair of horses—persons not to be suspected, under ordinary circumstances, of a bias towards larceny, who do not scruple to plunder themselves or their historical position, and who, since it would be a work beyond their powers to suppress the First of January outright, nathless do contrive to wink strangely when the day that gave them birth rolls by, as if they had forgotten its distinctive features, and felt no gratitude for the favour it conferred, in the far distant past. Since such facts are facts, not to be controverted, how happens it that at these moments, a really reluctant people are called upon to rejoice, in assumed jollity and forced smiles? Is it done to drive away care, or is it, after all, a joke—an invocation to merriment and convivialities—we address the question to the common sense of everybody—is it a joke—we mean, a very good joke— a joke to make us frisk, and give us a spasmodic twinge in the side—to peep into the mirror, and to count upon the cheek and brow, the additional flourishes of Time's villanously crampt penmanship? We speak not in regard to connoisseurship or dilletanteism; but are you, in your heart, fond of the study of these ungraceful hieroglyphics? Would you not prefer engrossments on other parchment? A majestic brow is admirable in a statue,— a fine phrenology may be a letter of recommendation; but it is yet to be made manifest that musings upon a wig, or meditations about the approaching necessity for a “scratch,” ever provoked a smile in him who was compelled to entertain them. Lear thought it flattery—but he was singular in his opinion—to be told that his beard was white; and it would perhaps move surprise, if there were an issue of invitations to celebrate the arrival of gray hairs. There are methods to create hunger when the appetite is disposed to sleep; but why it should render us eager for comfits and confections, because another round has been completed—because, though the jubilant be a year older, he is scarce a minute wiser—nearer the end of his career, yet not a penny richer—as full of sin and folly as before, but with much less time for repentance and amendment,—would puzzle Abernethy himself to explain.—There is, besides, a sad waste of gunpowder, and the loud rattle of fire-arms, hereabouts, and it may be appropriate to let off a blunderbuss as the old year expires. There are instances, no doubt, in which that weapon would be characteristic. Look ye, too, where comes the forgotten tailor, the neglected hatter, the unsought shoemaker, with a long line of others who have administered to your convenience—see them approach, not perhaps having “fire in each eye,” but certainly with “paper in each hand,” to bring you to a settlement—a winding up of old affairs, preliminary to a new onset. Do you find that funny, friend—heedless, thoughtless, perhaps cashless, friend?— Now, you perceive the moral of the matter—now, you obtain a glimpse of the special mission of this holiday; and the pecuniary settlement to which the time is subject, is but a type of the more impressive settlement which the recurrence of the day should impose upon us. If that be well performed, then, indeed, have we reason to rejoice. It has struck you often, in moments of calmness and reflection—after disappointments and in grief—in those minutes when the flush of enjoyment had faded to a sombre hue, and self-estimation had proportionably subsided—that there were changes in your own character and disposition which might be made to advantage. It would have been resented, if another had said as much; for you then thought, and still think, it may be mistakenly, that these defects are only apparent in full to their owner. Still, however, the amelioration was resolved upon. At 6 first, it was to begin “now.” Then came cares and pleasures; a little postponement was granted, and this great work, if we are not in error, lies in the dusty corners of your determination, quite unfinished. Could you not take it up to-day?—A more fitting time is not likely to present itself. Somebody has frequently promised—but, after the cautious fashion of Sir Giles Overreach, “we name no parties”—has promised very distinctly to himself—and there is no one with whom it would be more to his advantage to keep faith—that the New Year shall find him, in many respects, a new man. Do you know such a person—a friend, a brother, a lover or a husband, who has done this, in the view of evil habit, of indolence, of ill temper, of any of the thousands of temptations and of faults which beset the human family? Strengthen his will; give encouragement to his weakness. He may chance to need it. And then, it may not be too much to assume that, perfect as we are, there is no want of certain pestilent imps, who find places in our train, and are ever on the alert for mischief,—saucy companions, of whom we would gladly be rid, but that they take us by surprise, and await not the chastisements of our regret—little petulances, which at times prompt us to wound those who love us best—small discontents, which seek expression in embittered words —unrecognised envies, which lacerate the heart and disturb repose, leading to uncharitable thoughts, and unkindly judgments—petty jealousies, have we not, rendering us unreasonable, querulous, and ill at ease? Such restless spirits swarm the air, causing endless complications of annoyance. Let them, this day, be summoned to your footstool, to meet discharge, and, above all things, let us impress it on your mind to scan their faces closely. They are adroit at a disguise, and often elude the most careful watch; so that we know them not but in their effects, and by the sorrows they are apt to leave behind. If such be our policy, as the substratum of our merriment, and the undercurrent to our mirth, and if we can find nerve enough to accomplish but a part of what is deemed desirable,—if each New Year is thus assured of meeting with us so much wiser, and therefore happier— for wisdom is but happiness, after all,—than any of its predecessors, we shall “better brook the loss of brittle youth,” and meet the onward tide of time with buoyant hearts and an unshrinking hope—satisfied with the present, and with no terrors for the future.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE NEWS-BOY. Arms have had their day. The age of steel is past. The thunders of Mont St. Jean formed the grand finale to the melo-drama of military exploit, and the curtain fell, never to rise again, upon the last scene of martial greatness, when the laurelled warriors of France cast aside the baton of command to have recourse to their spurs. Bellona then went to boarding-school, and learned to comb her refractory locks into the pliant graces of the toilet, while Mars obtained a situation in a counting-house, and seated upon a three-legged stool, still nibs his pen to gain a livelihood. Romance expired at Waterloo. Chivalry expended itself when Ney was foiled; and the Belgian peasant unconsciously depicts the moral of the fall of the empire when he boils potatoes in the helmet of the knight, and cooks his mutton in a breastplate of the “Guard.” The world is tired of slaughter—the poetry of the shambles is exhausted. We live as long as we can now, and find existence none the worse for having a full supply of arms and legs. A body like a cullender is not essential to reputation, and death has become so unpopular that it is only by special favour that ambition can get itself hanged. New elements produce new combinations. When the musket rusts in a garret, and glory puzzles over the multiplication table and retails brown sugar, the restless impulses of humanity seek excitements before unknown. Strategy exhibits itself in the marts of trade. Napoleons are financiers. The sun of Austerlitz bursts through the clouds which overhang the stock exchange. Bulls and bears constitute the contending hosts of modern times, and there is no analogy to the “maraud,” unless we find it in embezzlement and defalcation. We are “smart” now—exceeding smart, and pugnacity is thrown to the dogs. Learning, too, leaves its solidity in the cloister, and, no longer frighted by trumpets and sulphurous vapors, spreads itself thinly abroad. Being in haste, the world reads as it runs, so that heavy books, like heavy artillery, remain in the arsenals. Man, commercial man, speculating man, financial man—man, heedless of gory greatness, but eager for cash, must know all that is in agitation. Having ceased to kill his neighbour, he is anxious to ascertain what his neighbour is about, that he may turn him and his doings to profitable account; and hence, in the place of those gaudy banners which used to flout the sky, instead of the oriflamme of nations, which once rallied their battalia, we gather round the newspaper, not with sword, and shield, and casque, but with ink-stained jacket and with pen in ear. Our clarion now, more potent than the Fontarabian horn, is the shrill voice of the news-boy, that modern Minerva, who leaped full blown from the o'erfraught head of journalism; and, as the news-boy is in some respects the type of the time—an incarnation of the spirit of the day,—a few words devoted to his consideration may not be deemed amiss. As the true Corinthian metal was formed from the meltings of the devoted city, thus the news-boy is the product of the exigencies of the era. The requirements of the age always bring forth that which is wanted. The dragon teeth of tyranny have often caused the earth to crop with armed men, and the nineteenth century, thirsting for information and excitement, finds its Ganymede in the news-boy. He is its walking idea, its symbol, its personification. Humanity, in its new shape, is yet young and full of undefined energies, and so is he. The first generation of his race not having outgrown their business, 6* the important part which youth thus trained, is destined to play in human affairs, is as yet too imperfectly developed even for the meditations of the most speculative philosopher that ever extracted glowing sunbeams from the refreshing cucumber; but, as nature does nothing in vain, it is fair to infer that the news-boy is destined, in one way or another, to fix the period which gave him birth, in the niche of history. Too many powerful elements combine in him not to be productive of grand results. What is the news-boy—what is necessary to his original constitution—what faculties are involved, cherished, strengthened and made, as it were, the preponderating forces of his character, by the calling to which he is devoted? Survey the news-boy—extract him from the buzzing crowd and place him on a pedestal, while you analyze his character in its psychological and physical details, estimating, at the same time, the past and future operation of circumstances in educating him for mature effort in the contentions of men. Anatomize him, and “see what breeds about his heart.” A rough study, truly—soiled garments and patches. The youth is not precisely fitted for presentation in the drawing-room, evident though it be that his self-possession would not desert him in the presence of an empress. Valets and body servants do not trouble themselves about him. Father and mother, brother and sister, if such there be, have enough to do in struggling for their own existence, without attending to the details of his costume, and many a repair is the result of his own handiwork in hours stolen from needful rest. That battered hat, grown foxy by exposure, is picturesque in its proportions, not so much from careless usage as from hard service, and those oxhide boots, embrowned and cracked, have shamed the feats of plank-walking pedestrains. Sooth to say, our hero is somewhat uncouth in his externals. That fair damsel there would scarcely covet him for a parlour pet. He would not shine amid carpet knights, nor would Titania weary Oberon with prayers to have him for her henchman. The news-boy would not weep either, if he were to know that perfumed pride and silken delicacy thus curl the nose at him; for he would be lost and wearied in such preferment. Observe his frame, so light, yet so strong;—so pliant, wiry and enduring. No “debile wretch” enters the ranks of these juvenile Præ torians; or, if he should venture on services so far beyond his capacity, exhaustion soon removes him. Glance at the expression of that weather-beaten face, prematurely channelled into line and hardened into muscle. Care, courage and resolution are in every curve of those compacted lips. The soft roundness of childhood has departed long since. That mouth knows more of the strong word, the keen retort, the well-weighed phrases of the bargainer, of cunning solicitation, and of the fierce wrangle, than of the endearing kisses of affection. It brings no memory of rosebuds. It is no poetic feature for romance to dwell upon, but a mouth of plain reality— of confirmed utilitarianism. It wreathes itself more readily into the mould of worldly intrepidity, than into the gentle dimples of early life. It is, in the news-boy, as in all mankind beside, a key to the individual mysteries of our nature. The impulses, the ruling trait, are here developed, and the news-boy offers no exception to the rule. The glance of his eye is as cold, but as bright, as the beaming sun of a frosty morning, which sparkles on the ice, but melts it not. Still, though self-interest and sordid calculation dwell in its depths, we find a laughing devil there, which feasts on satire and sports like the chevaliers of old, à l'outrance. Its jokes bite shrewdly, and the lance of its wit displays the point “unbated,” though not “envenomed.” When the news-boy turns awhile from business to the pleasures of companionship, he asks no quiet recreation. His raillery and his pleasant tricks both deal in heavy blows and rude interchanges. Your nice, nervous sensibility finds no quarter from one whose very existence in all its phases is roughness. Should he hereafter learn to woo, it will be “as the lion wooes his bride.” Such is the physique of the news-boy, and it contains many of the constituent points of greatness. Tossed early into the world, the impediments which cause other men to fail, are soon surmounted in his path. He has no kindly arm to lean upon, and, through mistaken tenderness, to make his steps unsteady. He is his own staff— his own protector. Of diffidence, he never heard the name—he does not know its nature. Imaginary barriers cannot interpose between him and his object; for he recognises none as worthier than he, and self-distrust plays no fantastic tricks to defeat the consummation of what he may resolve. He lives in deeds, and not in dreamy speculation—he is an actor, not a looker on, and practice has given him that estimate of his own powers which rarely falls below the mark, and which, best of all, surrounds disappointment with no unreal terrors. When he falls, he falls but to rise again with renewed strength, like the fabled Antæus. And while continued collision with the world thus hardens his intellectual being, his muscular energies, which sustain the spirit, receive a training of proportionate severity. He has no tender years. Let wealthy youth be housed in luxury, and guarded from the storm. Soft couches and protracted slumbers do not enervate the news-boy. Compared to him, the sun itself is a sluggard. No morning ray finds him in bed; the moon and stars witness his uprisings, and he travels forth in darkness to commence his daily toil. Let the rain fall in torrents—the lightning flash—the thunders roar, the news-boy laughs at the elemental strife. Heat and cold are alike indifferent to one who has such duties to perform. It is on him that society waits for its mental aliment, and can he falter—can he shrink before winds and showers, before frosts and heats, who, more truly than any human being, is the “schoolmaster abroad?” No— others may crouch around the fire, or shrink beneath their blankets, at the sound of winter's threatening blasts; but the news-boy springs up, whistling cheerily, to encounter any hardship that may oppose him. Now, it is contended that whole masses and classes of youth, thus educated, thus trained—who live, as it were, by their wits—by their boldness, their address, their perseverance—whose faculties are always literally at the grindstone—who daily practise endurance, fortitude, self-restraint, abstinence, and many other virtues; who are pre-eminently frugal and industrious; who learn to understand men and boys, dandies and dandizettes, and are schooled to emulation and competition—must of necessity produce something—not a little of roguery, mayhap, which is often the fungous growth, the untrimmed shoot, of a certain grade of cleverness. But we look for more than this—it genius is ever latent, the life of the news-boy must bring it forth. The blows which fall on him, would elicit sparks from the flint. In the school which boasts of such a pupil, society is the book, adversity the teacher, and harsh circumstance plays the part of rod and ferula. He is scourged into wisdom, almost before others can walk alone. In what peculiar way, Tom Tibbs, whose admirable portrait graces our present number, is likely to distinguish himself, remains to be seen. His faculties are expansive —roaming like summer bees. The moment of concentration, when genius, rallying upon its focus, burns its way through all impediments, has not yet come to him. But Tibbs is one of whom expectation may be entertained. In fact, he has long been spoken of as a “hopeful youth,” by many of those who know him; and though the phrase may often be applied derisively, as a sort of lucus a non lucendo, still this is but the vulgar error, which cannot comprehend the kittenhood of lionism—the unappreciated infancy of power. No one ever achieved distinction who did not begin a nuisance, just as greatness in a single walk, of necessity constitutes a bore; and it may be so with Tibbs. He has already learned the one great lesson of success. He looks upon the community as a collective trout—a universal fish, which must nibble at his bait, lie in his basket, and fill his frying-pan. On this maxim, heroes have overrun the world. It has been the foundation, not only of fortunes, but of empires. Why should it not elevate Tibbs? Especially as his soul has not been whittled down to a single point, by the process of acquiring the knowledge to which we refer. Tibbs has the affections, the sympathies, the twining tendrils of the heart, in as great perfection as can be expected in one who has been taught to look upon downright fact as the great purpose of existence. The pennies, however, do not engross him utterly; but when he is in pursuit of the pennies, that pursuit is made paramount. He takes his business as Falstaff did his sack, “simple, of itself;” and his pleasures are imbibed “neat,” never spoiling both by an infusion and admixture of either. That soldier is a poor sentinel who nods upon his post, and would both watch and wink upon a tour of duty. The winkings of Tibbs are wisely condensed into a continuous slumber; and when he watches, it is generally found that his eyes are quite as widely open as the eyes of other people. Tom Tibbs had a father, a necessity from which it is believed the greatest are not exempt, and in Tom's case, as indeed in many others, it was a hard necessity, from which it would have pleased him to be excused. Tom's father was a disciplinarian—that is, he compounded for his own delinquencies by a compensatory severity upon the delinquencies of others. When he had made a fool of himself abroad, he balanced the account and atoned for the folly, by chastising Tom at home, and thus went to bed with a cleared conscience and a weary arm. When he had spent more money upon a recreation than precisely suited his circumstances, the family were put upon short commons, and Tom's contingent of shoes and jackets, as well as those of his brothers and sisters—for he is not the only scion of Tibbsism—was economically retrenched. The elder Tibbs piqued himself much upon his paternal kindness in teaching prudence to his offspring. “You'll bless me for it,” said he, with tears in his eyes, as he prepared to hammer them all round, after having been fined for wheeling his barrow upon the pavement, “you'll bless me for it the longest day you have to live.” The elder Tibbs was patriarchal—he made the law as the necessity arose, carrying it into effect himself, and its adaptation to circumstances was wonderful. Any trouble in solving the equity of the case was instantly obviated by flogging Tom, and then old Tibbs would exclaim, “My conscience is easy—I do my best towards these naughty children—my duty is fulfilled—if they come to bad ends, they can't blame me for it. I have spared no pains to bring 'em up properly,” and he had not been sparing, so far as the strap was concerned. Mrs. Tibbs was a tender-hearted woman, who did not exactly understand parental duties as they were received by her husband; yet, being somewhat overcrowed by the commanding spirit of her mate, she sometimes almost began to think that Tom must indeed be rather a bad boy to require the neat's leather so often. But Mrs. Tibbs loved her children, and did her best to console them, thus preserving a verdant spot in Tom's otherwise arid heart; for, as his cuticle was hardened, his spirit also grew callous. The pressure of the times, however, at last compelled the Tibbs family to migrate westward; and the father, when two days out from the city, having become warm with his own eloquence upon the difficulties of making a living, called Tom to his side and diverged into a personal episode and an individual apostrophe: “It's so hard now to get along in the world, that I shouldn't wonder, if any thing happened to me, if these children were to starve. Tom, Tom, how often have I told you that you'd never come to good! Tom, Tom! you'll break my heart! Where's that strap? I don't want to do it, but I must!” Tom, however, could not be prevailed upon to “stay to supper,” and escaped, retracing his steps to the city, and dissolving all connection with the strap. He thought that he had received quite as much “bringing up,” in that respect, as was necessary. Tom felt his destiny strong within him. He threw himself into the bosom of the news-boys, and through their kindness, for they are a kindly race when properly approached, soon became one of the most distinguished of the corps. No one can sell more adroitly than he; his perseverance is mingled with tact, and his verbal embellishments as to the peculiar interest of the number of the journal he has to sell, are founded on fact. He never announces the steamer to be in before she is telegraphed, nor indulges in the false pretences which so often derogate from the dignity of the profession. He estimates its importance, and proceeds upon principle. The traveller who trades with Tibbs, at the cars, or on board the steamboat, may safely buy under the ringing of the last bell, without finding too late that his pennies have been exchanged for newspapers stale as an addled egg, and freshly pumped on, to give them an appearance of juvenility. Nor does Tom ever avail himself of hasty departures, to be oblivious in the matter of returning change. He does not, under such circumstances, “as some ungracious pastors do,” put your quarter in one pocket and fumble for sixpences in the other, until the train darts away; nor would he, if tempted to the performance of this unworthy feat, add insult to injury, by holding up the cash when distance had made its reception impossible, or by assuming that burlesque expression of hypocritical astonishment with which some paper-venders, in a similar catastrophe, outrage your feelings besides wronging your purse. As Tom often justly remarks to such of his colleagues as are habituated to these practices, “This 'ere chiselling system won't do. Nobody likes to be chiselled, and when you have chiselled everybody, why then they'll get a law passed, and chisel us all to chips. A joke to-day is often a licking to-morrow, mind I tell you.” Tom's philosophy was, at once, Franklinian and indisputable. He felt the necessity of obviating all danger of a war of races. He knew that nothing but mischief was to be anticipated, if all the rest of the human family were to be “chiselled” into a hostility against the news-boys; for the minority always stand in the predicament of being presented and suppressed as a nuisance, whenever the stronger party think fit to exercise the power of numbers; and, as a natural consequence, Tom was opposed to the practice of clustering about a corner and selling news-papers in a flock. “A sprinkling of news-boys, one or two in every square,” thought he, “is well enough. It's good for trade, and makes things lively; but to be cutting up, so fashion, all in a jam, why people go on t'other side of the way, and retailing's done for. I vote for 7 scatteration. Folks hate being obligated to fight their way through the literary circles.” But Tibbs, with all his good sense, has a weakness. There is a forte and a foible to every blade, and even such a blade as a news-boy cannot escape the common lot of humanity. Sound upon the general principle of not annoying others, yet, in the indulgence of his humour, he sometimes makes an exception. He especially dislikes Mr. Sappington Sapid, a starched gentleman of the old school, who never reads a journal, cares nothing for the current of events, and entertains a perfect horror of the modern style of newspapers and of all concerned in their distribution. In fact, he attributes much of the evils of the time to cheap journalism, and he has not been sparing of an expression of his views on the subject, whenever the opportunity was afforded. On some one of these occasions, it was his luck to wound the feelings of Thomas Tibbs, and Tibbs accordingly marked him for a sufferer. Incessantly was Mr. Sappington Sapid assailed. Not a news-boy passed his door without ringing the bell to ascertain whether a paper was not required—he never walked the streets without perpetual and ridiculous solicitations. When he appeared, all customers were left for his special annoyance, and, in consequence of failing in the attaint one day, when he directed an indignant kick at the provoking Tibbs—unpractised individuals should never essay the rapid and extemporaneous application of the foot—Mr. Sappington Sapid sat suddenly and unexpectedly down in a puddle of water, in full sight of a legion of his tormentors, who never forgot the incident, but would rehearse it, to the delight of their fellows, whenever the unfortunate man happened to present himself, and Tibbs was especially dexterous in giving the broadest effect to the incident. What a vitality there is in our worst mishaps! It would be nothing, comparatively, if disaster were circumscribed by its immediate consequences, and it would have made but little figure in Mr. Sapid's memoirs had he only caught cold by the operation referred to; but when a personal sorrow is transmuted into a general joke, it becomes, ipso facto, a living piece of attendant biography, a walking companionship, which even smiles over a man's last resting-place. Death itself affords no refuge to the hero of a “ridicule.” “Poor fellow!” say his dearest friends, “perhaps it's wrong to mention it now, but, by-the-way, did you ever hear how,—ha! ha! ho!—how he made such a fool of himself at Mrs. Dunover's pic-nic? Ho! ho! ha! Poor soul!!” Rob a church, or lay logs on the rail-road, and there is a chance that the last may be heard of it; but if a drollery, no matter how sad in its essence, be created at any one's expense, he and it are so far married that they cling together through life, while the jest is a “relict,” to move post mortem mirth, autopsical grins and necrological merriment. A dear departed is much more likely to be resurrectionised by a surviving joke, than by the most intrepid of body-snatchers, and the best of portraits is not so good a memento as being implicated in an anecdote which is sure to create laughter. Under an inkling of this truth, Mr. Sapid always denies that he is the person who “shook his foot” at the news-boys. But there are bounds to patience. A man is but a bottle before the fire of mischance, and when the heat becomes insupportable, he must of necessity explode, no matter how tightly corked by fortitude, or wired down by philosophy. “The grief that will not speak,” is a deadly inward fermentation. They who survive sorrow, are those who “exteriorize” sorrow, and give sorrow a free channel. To scold is the vital principle of practical hygieine for the ladies, and grumbling humanity rarely needs the doctor. The inference therefore is, that the average of existence would be at a higher rate, if the admirable counter-irritant of round swearing were not proscribed in refined society, thus killing people by the suppressed perspiration of an indignant spirit. Sapid, however, was none of these. Patience might sit upon a monument, if she liked; but there was nothing of the marble-mason in his composition, nor did he at all affect the “statuesque,” when vexation chafed his heart. If preyed upon in this way, though he never indulged in Commodore Trunnion's expletives, nor “shotted his discourse” like that worthy commander, yet he did not, by any means, pray in return, as Dinah had often reason to acknowledge, when the chamber pitcher was left vacant of water, or when forgetful Boots failed in the performance of his resplendent office. No! Sappington Sapid makes people hear of it when he is offended, justly thinking it better that their ears should be annoyed, than that he should pine away of an unexpressed inflammation. It was a bright forenoon, such as elicits snakes in the country, and evolves the fashionable in cities, when Mr. Sappington Sapid walked firmly along the street, filled with a settled purpose. His coat was buttoned up to the chin, to prevent the evaporation of his stern resolve; his lips were drawn together, as if to obviate all danger of evasion by word of mouth; his hat had settled martially down almost to the bridge of his nose, while his heels saluted mother earth so determinedly, that his whole frame-work jarred at the shock. If ever a man displayed outward symptoms of having his mind made up into the most compact kind of a parcel, it was Sappington Sapid, on this memorable occasion. No beggar would have dared to ask charity from him, under such an aspect. He was safe from being solicited to take a cab. They who met him, made way instinctively. “Under him, their genius was rebuked; as, it is said, Mark Antony's was by Cæsar;” a psychological phenomenon often manifest, when, by the force of an emergency, even inferior men are screwed up to the sublime,—just as valour's self shrinks abashed from the angry presence of a cornered cat. But whither wandered Sapid? No one knew. He had taken breakfast without a word, and had wandered forth in equal silence. Counsel he sought not—sympathy he did not require. When we are girded up, of our own impulse, to pull the trigger of a catastrophe, advice is felt to be an impertinence, and no spur is needed to prick the sides of our intent. We are a sufficiency unto ourselves. Legions could not make us stronger, and, therefore, Sapid disdained companionship or an interchange of thought. He, Sapid, was enough to fill the canvas for the contemplated picture. He was the tableau, all alone, so far as his share in the incident was to be concerned. Some clue to his state of mind may be afforded, when it is known that he was visited by a night-mare, a journalistic incubus, on the previous night. An immense Tom Tibbs sat upon his breast, and tried to feed him with penny papers. His head seemed to grow to the size of a huge type-foundery, and each of his ears roared like a power press. Then again, he was flattened into an immense sheet, and they printed him as a “Double Brother Jonathan,” with pictorial embellishments. He was expanded into whole acres of reading for the people, and did not awake until he was folded, pasted up, and thrust into the mail-bag; when, protesting against the ignominy of being charged “at the usual rate of newspaper postage,” he sprang up convulsively, and found that his night-cap had got over his nose. 7* “Is this the office of the `National Pop-gun and Universal Valve Trumpet?”' inquired Sapid, in sepulchral tones. “Hey—what? Oh!—yes,” gruffly replied the clerk, as he scrutinized the applicant. “It is, is it?” was the response. “H-umpse;” being a porcine affirmative, much in use in the city of brotherly love. “I am here to see the editor, on business of importance,” slowly and solemnly articulated Sapid. There must have been something professionally alarming in this announcement, if an opinion may be formed from the effect it produced. “Editor's not come down yet, is he, Spry?” inquired the clerk, with a cautionary wink at the paste-boy. “Guess he ain't more nor up yet,” said Spry; “the mails was late, last night.” “I'll take a seat till he does come,” observed Sapid, gloomily. Spry and the clerk laid their heads together, in the most distant corner of the little office. “Has he got a stick?” whispered one. “No, and he isn't remarkable big, nuther.” “Any bit of paper in his hand—does he look like State House and a libel suit? It's a'most time—not had a new suit for a week.” “Not much; and, as we didn't have any scrouger in the `Gun' yesterday, perhaps he wants to have somebody tickled up himself. Send him in.” St. Sebastian Sockdolager, Esq., the editor of “The National Pop-gun and Universal Valve Trumpet,” sat at a green table, elucidating an idea by the aid of a steel pen and whitey-brown paper, and, therefore, St. Sebastian Sockdolager did not look up when Mr. Sapid entered the sanctum. The abstraction may, perhaps, have been a sample of literary stage effect; but it is certain that the pen pursued the idea with the speed and directness of a steeple-chase, straight across the paper, and direful was the scratching thereof. The luckless idea being at last fairly run down and its brush cut off, Mr. Sockdolager threw himself back in his chair, with a smile of triumph. “Tickletoby!” said he, rumpling his hair into heroic expansiveness. “What?” exclaimed Sapid, rather nervously. “My dear sir, I didn't see you—a thousand pardons! Pray, what can be done for you in our line?” “Sir, there is a nuisance—” “Glad of it, sir; the `Gun' is death on a nuisance. We circulate ten thousand deaths to any sort of a nuisance every day, besides the weekly and the country edition. We are a regular smash-pipes in that line—surgical, surgical to this community—we are at once the knife and the sarsaparilla to human ills, whether financial, political or social.” “Sir, the nuisance I complain of, lies in the circulation —in its mode and manner.” “Bless me!” said Sockdolager, with a look of suspicion; “you are too literal in your interpretations. If your circulation is deranged, you had better try Brandreth, or the Fluid Extract of Quizembob.” “It is not my circulation, but yours, which makes all the trouble. I never circulate,—I can't without being insulted.” “Really, mister, I can't say that this is clearly comprehensible to perception. Not circulate! Are you below par in the `money article,' or in what particular do you find yourself in the condition of being `no go'? Excuse my facetiæ and be brief, for thought comes tumbling, bumping, booming”— and Sockdolager dipped his pen in the ink. Mr. Sappington Sapid unravelled the web of his miseries. “I wish you, sir, to control your boys—to dismiss the saucy, and to write an article which shall make 'em ashamed of themselves. I shall call on every editor in the city, sir, and ask the same—a combined expression for the suppression of iniquity. We must be emancipated from this new and growing evil, or our liberties become a farce, and we are squushed and crushed in a way worse than fifty tea-taxes.” “Pardon me, Mr. Whatcheecallem; it can't be done— it would be suicidal, with the sharpest kind of a knife. Whatcheecallem, you don't understand the grand movement of the nineteenth century—you are not up to snuff as to the vital principle of human progression—the propulsive force has not yet been demonstrated to your benighted optics. The sun is up, sir; the hill-tops of intellect glow with its brightness, and even the level plain of the world's collective mediocrity is gilded by its beams; but you, sir, are yet in the foggy valley of exploded prejudice, poking along with a tuppenny-ha'penny candle —a mere dip. Suppress sauciness! Why, my dear bungletonian, sauciness is the discovery of the age—the secret of advancement! We are saucy now, sir, not by the accident of constitution—temperament has nothing to do with it. We are saucy by calculation, by intention, by design. It is cultivated, like our whiskers, as a super-added energy to our other gifts. Without sauciness, what is a news-boy? what is an editor? what are revolutions? what are people? Sauce is power, sauce is spirit, independence, victory, every thing. It is, in fact,—this sauce, or `sass,' as the vulgar have it—steam to the great locomotive of affairs. Suppress, indeed! No, sir; you should regard it as part of your duty as a philanthropist and as a patriot, to encourage this essence of superiority in all your countrymen; and I've a great mind to write you an article on that subject, instead of the other, for this conversation has warmed up my ideas so completely, that justice will not be done to the community till they, like you, are enlightened on this important point.” St. Sebastian Sockdolager, now having a leading article for “The National Pop-gun and Universal Valve Trumpet,” clearly in his mind, was not a creature to be trifled with. An editor in this paroxysm, however gentle in his less inspired moments, cannot safely be crossed, or even spoken to. It is not wise to call him to dinner, except through the keyhole, and to ask for “more copy,” in general a privileged demand, is a risk too fearful to be encountered. St. Sebastian's eye became fixed, his brow corrugated, his mouth intellectually ajar. “But, sir, the nuisance”—said Sappington. “Don't bother!” was the impatient reply, and the brow of St. Sebastian Sockdolager grew black as his own ink. “The boys, sir, the boys!—am I to be worried out of my life and soul?” The right hand of St. Sebastian Sockdolager fell heavily upon the huge pewter inkstand—the concatenation of his ideas had been broken—he half raised himself from his chair and glanced significantly from his visiter to the door. “Mizzle!” said he, in a hoarse, suppressed whisper. The language itself was unintelligible—the word might have been Chaldaic, for all that Sapid knew to the contrary; but there are situations in which an interpreter is not needed, and this appeared to be one of them. Sapid never before made a movement so swiftly extemporaneous. He intends shortly to try whether the Grand Jury is a convert to the new doctrine of sauciness. Tibbs, in the meantime, grows in means and expands in ambition. Progress is in his soul, like a reel in a bottle. He aspires already to a “literary agency,” and often feels as if he were destined to publish more magazines at a single swoop than there are now in existence, each of which shall have upon its cover, a picture of “The News-Boy,” while the same device shall gleam upon the panels of his coach.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">GOSSIP ABOUT GOSSIPING. WITH HINTS ON CONVERSATION. It is a matter both theoretical and practical in our philosophy, (and we are reckless enough not to care who knows it, either,) that, next to lounging at a front window when the weather's sunny, to see the world from a safe and luxurious ambushment, there are few among human pleasures at once so cheap, so agreeable, and so enduring as that slipshod and unpretending delight of the leisure hour, stigmatized by ignorant incapacity under the reproachful name of “gossip.” We are not, however, about to trouble ourselves to prove the correctness of the assertion. There are cases wherein the logical demonstration is an impertinence. If a truth, in matters of feeling, come not home to us at the instant of its enunciation, why, our perceptions are defective—our experiences incomplete. We have not been educated and finished up to that point. It may be, indeed, that we are not calculated to attain it, even with opportunities the most favourable to this species of advancement; and it is not in the nature of words to change the quality of the material of which we are composed, or to anticipate the results of that practical schooling which chisels away the block to bring out the man. In the profundities of wisdom, you and I learn nothing from each other. Argument and demonstration are wasted, unless there be that within, which, to some extent at least, has experimentally proved the soundness of the doctrine. To be convinced, is but to recognise a conclusion towards which our imperfect intelligence had previously been tending; and hence it is that the treatise on morals is so often an encumbrance to the shelf. It addresses itself to those who are not sufficiently ripened by trial and observation, to be gathered up in the harvest of the ethical essayist. Available knowledge, in the main conduct of life, is a precious ore, to be, with toils and strugglings, mined out by personal effort. It is not enough that myriads have passed through the same process, and have devised to us their experiences as a legacy. We are only satisfied when, like the child, our own little hand has established the fact that fire will burn. We are sure of it then, and govern ourselves accordingly; but the mere dictum of mamma and all the warning voices of the nursery, could not otherwise have impressed it upon us that the lighted taper is an uncomfortable plaything, as dangerous as it is brilliant. Can vanity be soothed into an unassuming temper before its inordinate appetites have caused it to falter, enfeebled by the very food on which it grew? Is vaulting ambition to be checked, think you, by the uplifted finger of precept? Are we to be deterred by “wise saws and modern instances,” until we have felt it stinging in our inmost soul, be it by success, or be it by disappointment, that unregulated impulses and morbid cravings lead to satiety and to the sickness of the heart? So, the time may be long or short, before we turn with weariness from the champagne exhilarations of existence, to find health and comfort in its cooling springs; but, if we are capable of wisdom, that time must come; and happy they, who, through many stumblings, by much groping in thick darkness, with painful bruises and in sad tribulation, have reached the broad refreshing daylight of this conviction. Let them not regret the years that have been consumed. The remnant is the leaf of the sybil, its value enhanced by the antecedent destruction. Weep not over the afflictions that have been encountered in threading the labyrinths of passionate delusion. A prize has been gained worth all its cost; and we have now taken the first degree in the great university of human training. All our refinements, in the end, resolve themselves into nothing more than an unpretending simplicity; for simplicity is itself the highest of refinements. Your “frogged” coat and your embroidered vest are indications from the circus and the theatre. Rings and jewels and bijouterie, though they may clink and sparkle innocently enough, do still suggest ideas of the faro-table and a predatory life; while gaudiness and assumption give rise to an inference that we are making the first attempt in a position above our habitude. The true voluptuary, he who regards pleasure as a science and would derive from existence all the delight it is capable of yielding, is economical in his enjoyments, and shuns the debauch as a serpent in the path. Ignorance may feed fat at its evening meal; but he who takes things in their connection, as if they were links in a continuous chain, looks beyond the hour, and is content with tea and toast; sweet sleep and a clear head on the morrow being essential items in his calculation. Whatever be the line of our travel and the nature of our experiences, we arrive at simplicity at last, if we are so fortunate as to survive the exploration; and those who have outlived this arduous task, which cannot be performed by proxy, and which is a conscription admitting of no substitute, will agree with us that gossip, goodly gossip, though sneered at by the immature, is, after all, the best of our entertainments. With no disparagement to the relish of professional pursuits—without invidiousness towards the ball-room, the dramatic temple, the concert, the opera or the lecture, we must fall back upon the light web of conversation, upon chit-chat, upon gossip, an thou wilt have it so, as our mainstay and our chief reliance—as that corps de reserve on which our scattered and wearied forces are to rally. 8 What is there which will bear comparison as a recreating means, with the free and unstudied interchange of thought, of knowledge, of impression about men and things, and all that varied medley of fact, criticism and conclusion so continually fermenting in the active brain? Be fearful of those who love it not, and banish such as would imbibe its delights, yet bring no contribution to the common stock. There are men who seek the reputation of wisdom by dint of never affording a glimpse of their capabilities, and impose upon the world by silent gravity —negative philosophers, who never commit themselves beyond the utterance of a self-evident proposition, or hazard their position by a feat of greater boldness than is to be found in the avowal of the safe truth which has been granted for a thousand years. There is a deception here, which should never be submitted to. Sagacity may be manifest in the nod of Burleigh's head; but it does not follow that all who nod are Burleighs. He who habitually says nothing, must be content if he be regarded as having nothing to say, and it is only a lack of grace on his part which precludes the confession. In this broad “Vienna” of human effort, the mere “looker-on” cannot be tolerated. It is not to be endured that any one should stand higher than his deserts, because he can contrive to hold his tongue and has just wit enough to dodge the question. And there is no force whatever in an unwillingness to give forth nonsense, or in the dread of making one's self ridiculous. It is part of our duty to be nonsensical and ridiculous at times, for the entertainment of the rest of the world; and, if not qualified for a more elevated share in the performance, why should we shrink from the róle allotted to us by nature? Besides, if we are never to open our mouths until the unsealing of the aperture is to give evidence of a present Solomon, and to add something to the Book of Proverbs, we must, for the most part, stand like the statue of Harpocrates, with “still your finger on your lips, I pray.” If we do speak, under such restrictions, it cannot well be, as the world is constituted, more than once or twice in the course of an existence, the rest of the sojourn upon earth being devoted to a sublimation of our thought. But always wise, sensible, sagacious, rational—always in wig and spectacles— always algebraic and mathematical—doctrinal and didactic —ever to sit like Franklin's portrait, with the index fixed upon “causality”—one might as well be a petrified “professor,” or a William Penn bronzed upon a pedestal. There is nothing so good, either in itself or in its effects, as good nonsense. It is, in truth, the work of genius to produce the best article of the kind, and, if men and women cannot reach the climax in this particular, they owe it to the common welfare to soar as near it as their limited capacity will allow. But, while it is regarded as a bounden duty upon all who enjoy the protection of society, to talk on proper occasions, both for the benefit of others, and that, for ulterior purposes, the strength of each individual may be properly appreciated, still there is no intention to undervalue the advantage afforded by good listeners. They are a source of blessing for which the talking world cannot be too grateful. Did they not exist, the vast steam-engine of human ability would lack its safety-valve. Explosion would ensue, or we should murderously talk each other to death. The man fraught with intellectual product, would find no market for its disposition. The quick fancies of his wit would beat against the bars in vain, and perish miserably by their own efforts to escape. Our thinkings are for exportation—not to be consumed within. There must be no embargo on the brain, or the factory is stopped by accumulating goods. Hence, the speaker and the listener combine to make a perfect whole. The one is the soil—the other the sun—the plant and that refreshing shower, which enables the leaf to put forth and the bud to bloom. No man, whatever may be the intrinsic force of his genius, can form an idea of what he is capable, until he is well listened to. Much of his power lies in the auditory. There is a subtle correspondence between them, which raises or depresses as the sympathetic intercommunication happens to be the more or less perfect in its vibrations. But there should be alternation in this, to develope human powers, to increase human affections, to complete the republic. There must be no division into exclusive classes, the one all vivacity, all pertness, all tongue—an unremitting volume of sound and a vocal perpetuity of motion; while the other, subdued and overwhelmed, curves into a huge concavity of ear, into a mere tympanum for the everlasting drummer to play upon. Where this happens to be the case, from colloquial encroachments on the one hand, and from submissive dispositions on the other, there is a double degeneration—to words without meaning, and to hearing without heeding. They who are talked to beyond the bounds of salutary affliction, only escape the fatal result of being subjected to such cruelty, by emulating the rhinoceros in his impervious cuticle; so that the pattering storm of speech rebounds innocuously from the surface. They close the porches of the sense while elocution rages around them, and, snug within, cogitate securely upon their own ruminations. Turn from your florid rhetoric to the sharp interrogation, and you shall find the patient fast asleep as to external uproar, though his eyes be open. Nature has provided him with a safeguard— he has been bucklered by inattention, and has left you to your own applause. To listen well, it is not enough that we yield, rescue or no rescue, and ask not for quarter, when detained by the button or cornered in a cul de sac. More is required than hopeless resignation, as, with a sigh, we surrender to an inevitable fate. The abject look, so generally worn by the man who knows that he is going to be talked to, and evinces by his aspect that he has no hope of mercy, is unworthy of the heroic soul. It is emphatically an art, and it is scarcely necessary to state that there are moments when it is no easy art, to “lend me your ears” to our mutual profit and pleasure. This is not an anatomical demonstration we are upon, that the mere handing over of the physical body is sufficient. Your imaginations are not to ramble all about the fields, nozzling in every bush and giving chase to every butterfly. The appropriate interjection is wanted, living, breathing, burning; nicely timed, too, and imperceptibly strengthening the oratorical wing—not like the Roman citizen of the mimic stage, whose accordance with Brutus and whose sympathies with Antony, are stamped with that indifference which arises from supernumerary station, and whose limited share of the receipts causes him to care no more than the worth of fifty cents about “Cæsar's testament”—but as if the business were your own. It is imperative on you to adjust the countenance to the nicest expression of appreciating intelligence—to be in tune, not only in the tones of the voice, but in the cadence of the body—to display attention in the very play of the fingers—to laugh readily, just enough and no more, and to show by slight subsequent observation, that all which has been uttered is duly estimated, instead of bringing the speaker to the ground with a jarring shock, by betraying, in an unconscious word, that his flight has been alone. The mere powers of endurance—fortitude, patience, and long-suffering—are indeed much; but still, they are but a part of what is demanded. If it were not so, the passive pump, which stands in sad aridity before the door, would answer 8* every purpose. More is necessary than to be an unresisting recipient—a conversational “Deaf Burke,” who can endure any amount of “punishment” without being much the worse for it. Like the red warrior at the sake, the perfect listener should so comport himself as to induce the belief that he has pleasure in his pain, and invites its increased continuance. He should be made up of tact and benevolence—of courage and humanity. His nerve should be strong—his perception nice. At one moment he needs forbearance, to suppress the almost irresistible interruption, and anon, his rapid powers of anticipation must be ridden with a curb. His philological expertness cannot be permitted to patch the gaps of hesitancy, by the impertinent suggestion of a word; but, when intuitive promptness is expected, a broken syllable should point the way to a desired conclusion. Worse, much worse than nothing, is the uneasy listener, who, like “Sister Ann” upon the tower, gazes every way for relief, and “sees it galloping” at each passing cloud of dust, as if, in short, our beard were blue, and our tongue were as remorseless and as sharp as a Turkish scimitar; and worse than Sister Ann is the abstracted companion, who knows nothing of the subjunctive mood, but endeavours to break the finely woven thread of your discourse by crossing you with irrelevant ideas—he who interrupts your pathetic revelations—perhaps of love—you were in love once—almost everybody is—by coolly inquiring “when you saw Smith?”—As if you cared any thing about Smith—or were even thinking of Smith. Hang Smith!—Never suffer yourself thus to be overcome by Smith, and never talk to that man again, if another is to be had. Nor are kindly feelings to be entertained towards the accommodating friend, that provoking extract from the “Book of Martyrology,” who sits him down as nearly as possible in the attitude which patience has upon a monument, and looks at your approach as if you were surgery itself, fresh from the schools, all glitter with instruments and draped in bandage—compassionating his hard lot, but setting his teeth to suffer. Mark it well. Should you propose to tell this fellow any thing—volunteering to explain to him how it happened, clearly and circumstantially, and with no other view than to his enlightenment, be prepared for ingratitude, in advance—ingratitude, “more strong than traitors' arms.” A cold reluctance is within him, and he tries to play Procrustes with your narrative, by asking “how long it will take” to give it expression, his tolerance of you being measured horologically, as it were, by the hour-glass and dial. A shower-bath is warm encouragement compared to his notes of acquiescence; and if he does not yawn— what on earth are we to do with people that yawn?—is there no remedy in legislative action?—why, he always swears he understands—“oh, yes—perfectly”—while calculating the odds and chances of some distant speculation, to which you are not a party. It will be observed that individuals of such a sort are troubled with a propensity to know “what o'clock it is”—not that they have any particular interest in the hour, on their own personal account, but from a vague hope that the time of day may chance to have something in it alarming to you, and that you are to be scared from your present prey to attend to a remote engagement. A benevolent hearer never wants to know what o'clock it is. There is a morose misanthropy in the desire, of which he is incapable; and if an acquaintance with the precise moment be inadvertently forced upon him, he has no such cruelty in his bosom as to affect a look of surprise and consternation, while he hypocritically protests that he had “no idea it was so late.” They who are loudest in saying that they had “no idea it was so late,” for the most part, fib. They had that idea, and more. They believed that it was as late, and they hoped it might be a great deal later. They were waiting for the clock to sue out a habeas corpus in their case. “Didn't think it was so late,” indeed. Pshaw! What question was there touching hours and minutes, when our story was but half developed? Were we singing to Maelzel's Metronome, pry'thee, that we are thus to be reminded of beats and bars, and the prescribed measure of a stave? “Late,” say'st thou? What is “late?”—There is no such thing as “late” in modern civilization. Steam has annihilated space, and the “dead-latch-key” has left the word “late” a place in the vocabulary, no doubt; but it has been deprived of its operative meaning. When some one sat up for you, then lateness was possible; but now—do you see this little bar of steel, with its pendant and arabesque termination—this talismanic “open sesame?” “Late” expired when the powers of invention reached their climax in fashioning forth this curious instrument. No one can come in late. Sit thee still, and be not antediluvian. Now-a-days, and especially now-a-nights, it is always early enough. But good listeners, as there has been unhappily too much occasion to show, are rarities. When they die, they should have monuments loftier far than that of Cheops. Pyramids, with “forty centuries looking from their top,” would not be too much of honour for such philanthropists; and, to render education what it ought to be, the human family should be trained to listen, and, at the same time, taught to talk. To sit still with dignity and composure, is as difficult as to move with ease and grace; yet both are matters of importance in the work of refinement. But it is much more essential to success that our presence should be hailed with pleasure, because, whether speaking or being spoken to, the faculty is possessed of giving pleasure to those by whom we are surrounded. To converse well—to gossip delightfully, is an art that richly deserves to be studied. It does not follow that one is a conversationist, or a perfect gossip, by such endowments, valuable as they are when properly qualified by a little of the “allaying Tiber” of sound discretion, as fertility of mind, a magazine of facts, and a flood of fluency. “Did you ever hear me preach?” said Coleridge to Charles Lamb. “I never heard you do any thing else,” was the sarcastic but truthful reply; and herein abides the common error. There is a fever of talkativeness, occasional with some, but constitutional in others, which is the bane of social enjoyment. “First-fiddleism” is as unpleasant to come in contact with, as to pass an evening encaged with a lion of literary, scientific, or metaphysical renown. Your Van Amburgs and your Driesbachs may be fitted for such an encounter; but mortals of inferior nerve find an unpleasant species of annihilation in the contact. Do not, then, attempt the lion's part, even if it be “nothing but roaring;” nor, unless assured past doubt that you possess the skill of Nicolo Paganini, is it ever wise to compel protracted attention to your single string, when others have quite as strong a desire to scrape their Cremonas, as that which burns in your own musical bosom. Play no more than is necessary to the harmonious effect of the whole orchestra; and, should occasion offer for a solo, give it and be done. Monopoly in discourse is “most tolerable, and not to be endured.” It should be punishable by statute, thus to invade the inalienable right of utterance. It is not even freedom to go abroad, when the garrulous kite has wing, to swoop upon his quarry. The liberty—the life itself—of the citizen is at stake, from that stoutly timbered magazine of words, who, strengthened by practice, and warmed by self-complacency, sustains no injury from wind or weather, and will dilate for hours, in frosty streets, to those who come within the dreadful clutch. We see him now, smiling in conscious triumph, as his prize shivers, shakes, and trembles almost to spectral nothingness, and feels most sadly that this is not all his sufferings—that catarrhs, and feverous aches and pains creep into him at every word. Homicidal—is it not, thus to thin out our population? An oversight in criminal jurisprudence, to let destruction forth into the highways, to run at unprotected men. Cunning doctors do not note it in their cautions, and the bills of mortality are silent on the subject; but it is no less a truth, that though the victim may sometimes be able to travel homeward after the catastrophe, he often gets him to his bed, if he escape the undertaker, from such combined assaults of breeze and bore as are now before us. Wouldst thou despatch thine enemy? What need of steel or poison—why lurk in slouched hat, in moustache, or with stiletto? There is a safer method, and, having no other accomplice than the thermometer, waylay him as he goes, with smiling face and oiled tongue. You have him there, and safely too. Chemistry has no surer poison, if you hold him fast; and justice has no cognisance of the deed. The true conversationist requires as nice a balance of qualities as the adroit swordsman. He should have an eye, an ear and a tongue, equally on the alert, perfectly under control, and skilled to act together. It is his duty to be able to mark the moment when a slumbering idea is awakened in the mind of another, and to afford opportunity for its development. When the thought quivers in an almost inaudible murmur upon the lips of the timid, it is not to be suppressed in premature death by the rattling noise of practised confidence; not to be driven over, if we may so describe it, by each hackney cab that thunders up the street. It claims to be deferentially educed, not so much by a display of patronising encouragement, which is almost as fatal as harsh disregard, but by that respectful attention which creates no painful sense of inferiority. He cannot pretend to civilization, who, in his wild dance of intellectual excitement, tramples under his massive foot all the little chickens of our imagination, and scares each half-fledged fancy back to its native shell. Be it rather your pleasure to chirp the tremblers forth to the corn of praise and the sunshine of approbation. Who has not found himself to be totally absorbed by the volubility of others; so that he could neither find subject nor words, even when an interval was left for their exercise? And who has not often been altogether debarred from the delight of speaking, merely because he had not space to set himself fully in motion? Many, perhaps, have resigned themselves to the taciturnity of La Trappe and have gone voiceless to their graves, from injudicious treatment in this respect. The humane citizen, then, will not of himself take all the labour of talking, lest he may be inadvertently stifling a Demosthenes, and smothering a Cicero—a case, it is true, which does not very often happen, though it might happen. And, besides, let it be remarked, there is no fact, in our day of innovation, scheming and discovery—when we reform, remodel, and lay our hands upon every thing —which deserves to be more strongly imprinted on the recollection than this, that man does not go forth into society, “no, nor woman neither,” armed, cap-à-pie, like a gladiator, to battle for opinion, or to thrust the sword of conversion through reluctant ribs. Let such things be confined to the dedicated halls of controversial debate, where one may be polemically impaled, secundum artem, expecting no better treatment. It is good to be wise— “merry and wise,” saith the song; but, then, wisdom need not always be at our throat with spoon and bowl, determined to administer nutriment, without regard to the state of the appetite. Did it never occur to you, my game friend, as you strapped on your gaffs, and crowed defiance at a rooster of another feather, that the rest of the social circle do not derive your pleasure from the “set-to,” and would gladly be excused from being annoyed by the argumentative combat? And, as for hobbies, they prance prettily enough on their proper ground; but do not let them caracole in the parlour. People would rather be kicked by any thing than by other people's hobbies; and, again, these hobbies, being merely composed of wood and leather, are never wearied, and cannot stop. They outstrip everybody, and carry none with them. Hark, in your ear. Leave hobby at home; he will not be restive or break things, when you are not by. It is disagreeable to be ridden down by these unaccommodating quadrupeds. Folks do not like it. The engrossing idea, too, should be hung up with the hat in the vestibule. It is near enough there; and, admitting that you have troubles of your own, ambitions of your own, prospects of your own, projects and inventions of your own, let it always be borne distinctly in mind that this, singular as it may appear, is, to a certain degree, the case with several other individuals of your acquaintance. What right they have to an engrossing idea when yours wishes to awaken their sympathies, is a point of equity which we cannot take it upon ourselves to decide; but it is so, nevertheless, as the groaning soldier found when rebuked for making so much noise over his hurts, “as if, forsooth, no one is hit but yourself.”— “Am I then reposing on a bed of roses?” said Guatemozin, in a similar spirit, to his complaining courtier, when Spanish cruelty had stretched them upon the glowing grate; and every man has, to some extent, a gridiron to himself.—To push this point still further, are they entitled to rank with conversationists, who stand as greyhounds on the slip, with straining eyes and quivering limbs, heedless of all remark, and waiting only till an opening be made, that they may course their peculiar game, rabbit or otherwise, as the case may be? Are they qualified gossips, who only talk to exercise the organ, and to luxuriate on the sound of their own sweet voices? —who, at last, dash forward over every impediment, and, by their bad example, like prairie horses in a stampede, set the whole circle into a very Babel of tongues—into what we may call a steeple-chase, straight across the country, and through any man's field—each for himself, boot and saddle, whip and spur? Nay, never think it. He is scant in his schooling who shifts impatiently from foot to foot when another has the floor—who darts his restless head into the aperture of every pause, in the hope that the shoulders may be permitted to follow, and who is only kept in abeyance by those stentorian lungs which crush the puny interruption. No—to gossip well is a delicate thing—a game of address—a school of self-command—an academy for nice perceptions. To be skilled in it, involves the main points of an accomplished gentleman. It furnishes, moreover, a key to character. The selfish man cannot be versed in it, for he has no appreciation of the minor rights of others, and, in this garden, no compulsory code exists to prevent him from pocketing all the fruit. Harshness is incompatible with it, for it is the very essence of respectful consideration. The domineering spirit cannot gain laurels here; while pride and vanity display themselves in their true colours. The proselytes of Lavater and the disciples of Combe may, by their science, be enabled to read the soul; but, as the one traces the lines of the countenance, 9 and the other toils among the hills and valleys of the skull, the surest observer of disposition is he who notes the deportment of those bearing part in the animated gossip. Before him, the secret unrolls like a map, and the geography of the heart is familiar to his searching eye. When the glow lights up within, there is a ray behind the best adjusted mask which reveals the features as they are. As the day is utilitarian, the cui bono, the advantage and the profit, form a material part of every matter, and it will be found that to cultivate these responsive faculties —to add the art of hearing and of speaking to the catalogue of accomplishments—has a moral as well as a pleasure in it. A skilful talker, who is, at the same time, a thorough listener, is not a spontaneity—an unlessoned creature. Oaks do not bear such acorns. The spirit of such a one, if feeble, has been strengthened. His temper, if tempestuous, has been subdued. He has sympathies, cultivated and refined. He feels for those around him, in great things and in small. He is that wisest of philosophers, the well regulated man of the world, who shuns the wrong because he knows its evils, and adopts the right, from having proved it to be an essential to his own happiness, and the happiness of others. And what contributes more largely to this important end, than a perfect system of hearing and of being heard? Nature does not furnish it. To be nothing more than natural, is to be an egotist, a glutton, a monopolizer. That the untrained steed has power enough, is not to be disputed; but, in the simplicity of his unsophisticated heart, he is apt to apply his strength in an uncomfortable manner, to those who wander within range of his heel, never thinking that the joy he derives from the rapid extension of his locomotive muscles, is not likely to be reciprocated on our part. He is not aware of the difference of sensation between kicking and being kicked, which is often a point to be considered. It is even so with bipeds, who have not properly undergone the discipline of the manège. It cannot be denied that the child of nature has something in him of the poetical; but, in practice, he is likely to border on the uncouth and uncontrollable. If, therefore, after the experiment of a year, according to our suggestion, it be found that the trial does not bring out the better constituents of character, while restraining those of less amiability, why, continue to chatter, without stint or limitation, to the end of your days, and throw no chance away, unless compelled to it by exhaustion; or, if it please you, sit in sulky silence, and have never a word by way of change.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SHIVERTON SHAKES; OR, THE UNEXPRESSED IDEA. Shiverton Shakes had an idea—a cup of tea had warmed the soil of his imagination, and it was flowering to fruit—he had an idea in bud—a thought which struggled to expand into expression, and to find a place in the great basket of human knowledge. Shiverton Shakes had an idea, and ideas, whether great or small—whether good, bad or indifferent—must have utterance, or the understanding wilts and withers. Even the body sympathetically suffers. It is easy to mark the man who smothers his intellectual offspring—the moral infanticide, with his compressed lip, his cadaverous hue, his sinister eye, and his cold, cautious deportment; whose thinkings never go out of doors, and lack health for want of air and exercise. That man is punished for his cruelty to nature, by a dyspepsia affecting both his mental and physical organization. There is no health in him. But it must not be forgotten that Shiverton Shakes had an idea—little Shiverton, in his earlier years, when the world is fresh and new, and when the opening faculties are wild in their amazement. “Mamma,” said Shiverton, suspending the assault upon his bread and butter, “mamma, what d'ye think? —as I was going down—” Mr. and Mrs. Shakes were too earnestly engaged in the interchange of their own fancies, to heed the infantile voice of Shiverton. “What d'ye think, ma?” repeated the youthful aspirant for the honour of a hearing; “as I was going down Chestnut street, I saw—” “A little more sugar, my dear,” said Mr. Shakes. “And, as I was telling you,” added Mrs. Shakes, “Mary Jones has got—” “Sweetened to death! There—don't!” said Mr. Shakes, withdrawing his cup rather petulantly. “Down Chestnut street, I saw—” “A new black hat, trimmed with—” “Sugar enough to fill a barrel,” muttered Mr. Shakes. “I saw—” “Hat with—” “Tea spoilt altogether—give me another—” “Very little black hat, trimmed with—” “Two boys, and what d'ye think!” chimed in the persevering Shiverton Shakes. “Why, what is all this?” exclaimed Mr. Shakes, as he raised his eyes in anger. “Hats and boys and sugar! I never heard such a Babel!” “That child!” ejaculated Mrs. Shakes; “did you ever know—” “Two boys, and they were a—” continued Shiverton, pursuing his own peculiar train of reminiscence, undisturbed by Mary Jones or any thing else, and happy in feeling that there now appeared to be no impediment to the flow of his narrative. But yet, this moment, though he knew it not, was a crisis in the fate of Shiverton Shakes—a circumflex in the line of his being; slight perhaps in itself, but very material in determining the result of the journey. Mr. Shakes fixed his eye upon his son—Mr. Shakes seemed to ponder for a moment. “I cannot stand it any longer,” said he, “and what is more, I won't—that boy is a nuisance—he talks so much that I cannot tell what I'm reading, taste what I'm eating, or hear what I'm saying. I'm not sure, in fact, when he 9 is present, that I know exactly whether it's me or not. He wants to talk all the time.” Luckless Shiverton had been running wild in the country for a considerable period, and, while his elocutionary capacities had been greatly developed, the power of endurance in his parents had been weakened for want of exercise. They were out of practice—he was in high training. They were somewhat nervous,—he was, both in mind and body, in the best possible condition, deriving as much nourishment from the excitement of noise as he did from food. “Well, I declare, he does talk all the time and asks such questions—so foolish I can't answer them,” exclaimed the mother, with her usual volubility; “just as if there was a reason for every thing—so tiresome. I do declare, when he is in the room, I can scarcely slip in a word edgeways, and his tongue keeps such a perpetual clatter, that since he came back, I hardly think I've heard my own voice more than—” “You hear it now,” said Mr. Shakes; “but I'm determined Shiverton shall be spoiled no longer. Do you hear? From this time forth, you must never speak but when you are spoken to. Little boys must be seen, and not heard.” “Well, I do declare, so they must—mus'n't be seen and not be heard—that's the way to bring up children.” “Shiverton,” added his father, impressively; “Shiverton, when you are old enough to talk sensibly, then you may talk. When you are mature enough—I say mature—” “What is mature?” inquired Shiverton, tremblingly. “Mature is—never mind what it is—when you are older you'll know. But, as I before remarked, when you are mature enough to understand things, then you may ask about them.” The rule, thus emphatically laid down, was enforced inexorably. It, therefore, not only happened that Shiverton's idea was suppressed on the occasion referred to, thus preventing the world from ever arriving at a knowledge of what really was done by those two mysterious boys, as he went down Chestnut street, but likewise cutting him off from other communications relative to the results of his experience and observation. Henceforth he was to be seen, not heard—a precept and a rule of conduct which he was compelled to write in his copybook, as well as to hear, whenever the workings of his spirit prompted him to “speak as to his thinkings.” The twig was bent—the tree inclined. What Shiverton Shakes might have been, had the trunk of his genius been permitted to ascend according to its original impulse, is now but matter for conjecture. How far he would have reached in his umbrageous expansion, had the shoots of his soul been judiciously trimmed and trellised—sunned, shaded and watered—who can tell? There may be a blank in glory's book which his name should have filled—an empty niche in our century's greatness, where Shiverton Shakes should have been embalmed. At this instant, perhaps, the world suffers because some momentous truth which it was for him to have drawn to light, is still “hushed within the hollow mine of earth.” Why, indeed, may we not suppose that when he was rebuked for making chips, to the annoyance of the tidy housekeeper, an invention perished in its very inception which would have superseded the steam-engine? What might Shiverton Shakes—Shiverton cherished— Shakes undismayed—what might he not have been? A warrior, probably, phlebotomizing men by the battalion and by the brigade, and piling skulls to build his way to fame. Why not a patriot and a statesman, heading parties and carrying elections, with speeches from the stump and huzzas from the multitude? Nor would it be considering too curiously if it were to be imagined that, had circumstances been propitious, Shiverton Shakes might, at this very hour, have been in the enjoyment of the highest of human honours and the most sublime of modern inventions, that of being pilloried by the political press and flung at by half the nation—the new pleasure, for which an exhausted voluptuary of the classic age breathed sighs in vain. But such delights as these were denied to Shiverton Shakes, who was too strictly taught to be seen and not heard—who was not to speak until he was spoken to; in consequence whereof, as the invitation was not very often extended, he came near being deprived of the faculty of speech altogether. When Shiverton Shakes came home—“why, there's company in the parlour,” and Shiverton Shakes went to learn manners and deportment in the kitchen. Shiverton Shakes breakfasted, dined and supped in the kitchen, and when promoted by a call up stairs, Shiverton mumbled in his words, fumbled in his pockets and rumpled among his hair. An ungainly lout was Shiverton Shakes. He had been, so to speak, paralyzed by his undeveloped idea. His original confidence, instead of being modulated and modified, had been extirpated, and the natural aplomb of his character—that which keeps men on their feet, maintaining the adjustment and balance of their faculties —had been destroyed. “The boy is a booby,” said Mr. Shakes; “why can't you stand up straight and speak out?—you're old enough.” “Well, I do declare,” subjoined Mrs. Shakes, “I'm quite ashamed of him. I can't think how he came to be such a goose. When Mary Jones spoke to him the other day, I do declare if he didn't put his thumb right in his eye, and almost twist himself out of his jacket; and when she asked him what he learned at school, all he could say was `he! he! I don't know.' He shan't show himself again till he behaves better—a great long—” “I don't like to be harsh—in fact, I'm rather too indulgent,” philanthropically remarked Mr. Shakes; “but, if I were to do my duty by this boy, I ought to chastise him out of these awkward tricks. There—go—down stairs with you. It's the only place you're fit for.” “He must never be allowed to come up when any body's here—not till he knows how to speak to people.” Such was the earlier life of Shiverton Shakes. He was not to plunge into the billows of the world before he had learned to swim, and yet was denied the opportunity to acquire the rudiments of this species of natation, in those smaller rills and ripples where alone the necessary confidence and dexterity are to be obtained. It was perhaps believed that he could cast the boy off and assume the man, without preliminary training, and that, having been seen but not heard, for so many years, he would have an instinctive force, at the proper moment, to cause himself both to be seen and heard, thus suddenly stepping from one extreme to the other. There may be such forces in some people—in people who, in a phrenological aspect, have a large propelling power, to drive them over the snags, sawyers and shallows of this “shoal of time.” They were not, however, to be found in Shiverton Shakes. Nor was he a proof of the correctness of that common parental theory, so often urged to palliate and to excuse deficiencies in culture and supervision, that he would “know better when he grew older,” thus endeavouring to make future years responsible for duties which should be performed by ourselves and at the existing moment. This method of “knowing better” may suit the procrastinating disposition, and there may be instances in which it engenders a corrective influence; but it is at best a doubtful experiment to permit defects to “harden into petrifaction,” while awaiting the uncertain period of removal. That we may “know better when we are older” is like enough; but then, will we do better? Who, of all the world, does better—much better—half as much better as he ought—as he “knows better?” There are differences, sad to experience, hard to overcome, between knowing and doing. The right habitude is the surest panoply. Shiverton Shakes had no habitude but the wrong habitude—no panoply at all. Shiverton went forth into the world—shrinkingly forth— modestly forth, and so forth, which perhaps is very amiable as an abstraction, though its value, in a peculiarly brazen state of society, is not quite so great, in a practical point of view, as the school-books would have us to believe—for if, as we are told, this modesty is a candle to one's merit, there must be some strange omission in regard to lighting the wick, and, unless that process be complied with, it is as clear as darkness can make it, that all the candles in the universe will do but little toward an illumination. It is at least certain that Shiverton's merit gained no refulgence from his unobtrusiveness, and that his retiring disposition, so far from promoting his interests and extending his fame, according to the philosophic notion on the subject, came near causing him to be pushed out of sight and forgotten altogether. No one searched him from his obscurity—fortune passed by his door without knocking, and reputation swept onward without offering him a seat in its vehicle. Yet Shiverton was as modest as modest could be—as modest, according to the popular comparison, as a sheep. He thought nothing of himself at all—he invariably got out of the way when other people wanted to advance, on the principle of “after you is manners,” and when others spoke first, he was particularly careful to speak last, or not to speak at all; suppressing his own wishes, feelings, and opinions, to promote the general harmony. A retiring man was Shiverton, and he obtained an occupation wherein his main intercourse was with his pen and with columns of figures, so that he still could be seen and not heard, according to the regulation which governed his childhood. He stooped as he walked, that his superiority of height (for Shiverton had stretched in longitude far beyond his unpretending wishes) might be lost, as it were, in the smaller crowd; and he went home, as far as it was possible to do so, by the “alley way,” to escape the ostentation of parading the thoroughfares, and to elude the embarrassing operation of returning salutations to those with whom he was unavoidably acquainted. What would Shiverton Shakes not have given if he had known nobody—if there were nobody here but himself, or if he could consume this troublesome “how d'ye do” existence in a back room, up three pair of stairs, where no one could by possibility come? And his bashfulness grew by being indulged. He suffered, not only by the painful sensations of his own timidity, but more by the thought that others likewise saw into his perturbations, and derived enjoyment from his internal distress. He appropriated every laugh to himself—he could not think that when he was within range of observation, there could reasonably be any other jest so likely to provoke a smile; and when people talked together with mirthfulness on their countenance, he was sure that the awkwardnesses and defects of Shiverton Shakes were under discussion. He had never heard of any thing else at home, and he always felt as if he were a discreditable intruder, who ought, if any thing, to apologize for having come into this breathing world at all. Had there been such a thing as a back door to our sublunary sphere, he would certainly have opened it, if it could have been done without noise, and have crept out, glad to escape into the immeasurable solitude of ether. But a retreat of this sort is not possible, according to existing planetary arrangements, without a recourse to means to which Shakes had a repugnance. The sensibility of his nervous system rejected the thought of a cold bath by midnight, with brickbats in his vest and paving stones in his coat pockets—the pistol is a means of dismissal altogether too noisy for the retiring disposition, and the elevation of the cord shows an aspiring temper which would not have been at all characteristic in Shiverton Shakes. Besides, a jury in such cases generally looks for the impulsive reason, and how ridiculous it would seem to be returned in the newspapers, as one who had voluntarily gone defunct through lack of brass! Such an imagination could not be entertained even for an instant. There would be more chuckling than ever. Shiverton resolved to live—to be Shakes to the end of his terraqueous term, no matter how unpleasant it might be. Still, however, manœuvre as one may, we cannot always avoid contact with the world in some of its phases. Invitations will come, for instance, from which there is no moral possibility of evasion. To be very unwell, sometimes answers a good purpose, if indeed these dodging purposes be ever good, when the motive is simply a dodge from a failure in self-reliance. It will do to have prior engagements occasionally when none such exist, and the pressure of business at certain seasons may be extreme; but, exert ourselves to that end as we may, there are few individuals who can contrive to be ill all the time, or always to have a prior engagement, or to be busy so continually as not to have an evening to spare; and then a point blank non inventus, without the shadow of a palliation, is scarcely to be attempted under certain circumstances. It requires the imperturbable solidity of a dead wall to be guilty of it. It sits upon the soul like a night-mare, and the guilty wakes next morning with a conscience as heavy as a millstone. Shiverton Shakes was cornered by such an invitation—to a dance of the most extensive and brilliant description—in honour of the marriage of the daughter of one concerning whom he had post mortem expectations—expectations which he fondly dreamed would productively survive the individual who had given rise to them. It was, therefore, what we may call, for want of an established phrase to describe it, the invitation undeniable—the trident of an appeal, which forks on either side and pins one through the body. It was an invitation which, with all Shiverton's agile practice in this respect, he could neither leap over nor creep under. It was not to be got round, on the right hand or upon the left. It enflanked and enfiladed—encircled and hemmed in. Yet, if boldly faced, it was obvious that Shiverton Shakes could not help being, to some extent at least, a feature on the occasion—occasions, like countenances, must have features, or they cease to be occasions. But to be suddenly elevated into a feature— projected from the level into a promontory, like some diver duck of a volcanic island—when we are not used to it—when we don't know how! Who, in such a crisis, could avoid feeling like Shakes? To be a protuberance— a card—a first or a second fiddle, with no acquaintance with the bow and innocent of rosin—to dance with the bride—to be fascinating to the maids—to make himself generally agreeable, he, who had never before been on such hard duty—to be easy, graceful, and witty—“preposterous and pestiferous!” cried Shiverton Shakes; “me making myself agreeable! I should like to catch myself at it.” Shiverton was haunted by Mrs. Marygold's note. In his dreams, it was like the air drawn dagger of the tragedy. 10 It seemed to “marshal him the way he was to go,” and beckoned him on, not to Duncan's surcease—Duncan surceased in the dark—the fewer witnesses the better— but to something much worse, in his fearful estimation— to violins and laughter—to smiles and compliments—to airs and graces—to silks and cologne—blooming bouquets, pearly teeth and sparkling eyes—more terrible to him than frowning ramparts and stern artillery. Shiverton sat alone in his chamber. The lamp burned dimly, and the fatal note, its perfume not yet departed, lay before him. “There's my ankle,” said he, after a gloomy pause, “if I could only sprain it now, without hurting myself much—sprain it gently—but no—that wont do—they'd guess in a minute—and I couldn't very conveniently contrive to break my neck for a day or two, by way of something original; but I almost wish it was broke. It would save a fellow a great deal of trouble. I should like to raise a fever, if I only knew how; but I can't find a headache with all the shaking I can give it. Perhaps it wouldn't do to be found `no more' when they came to call me to breakfast, on the morning of this horrible dance; but I wish I was no more—I wish I never had been more at all. But more or less, I must go, if an earthquake does not intervene, or if there is not a blow up of some sort. But these things never happen when they're wanted. I never found the dentist out in my life when I was to be hurt. There are matters which can't postpone. Hanging day is hanging day, whether it rains or shines, and then hanging day is never yesterday—I don't mind things when they're past—hanging day is always to-morrow or to-day—something to come—something that's not done, but must be done. It appears to me that I'm never done, but always doing—going to be done.” After this escapade, Shiverton was moodily silent— expressionless outwardly, save in the uneasy transposition of his pedal extremities, while his brows were knitting like a weaver's loom. “If they'd let me be, now—but they wont—they never do,” continued he sharply; “let me be in a corner, or in the refreshment room, eating things and drinking things— cracking nuts, or forking pickled oysters, or spooning in ice cream, and nobody looking on—it always chokes me when anybody's looking on—things wont get on the spoon, and my plate is sure to spill and run over—if they'd do so, I'd be able to get along well enough; but then I must go in among the ladies—there's nothing scares me more than ladies—good-looking ladies particularly—I can't talk to them—they frighten me like Old Scratch. Yet I've got all the books about manners, in that closet—`American Chesterfield,' `Etiquette,' and all that—why don't somebody publish how to flourish away in other people's houses, so we can learn it in three lessons, like French, Italian and Spanish? That's the kind of cheap literature I want.” At last he sprung impatiently from his chair, and the clock struck one. “Since I must go to Mrs. Marygold's whether I will or not, I had better begin to practise as soon as possible— practise tea party”—and Shiverton brushed up his hair and pulled down his wristbands; “that's the way, I suppose.—Now I come in, so,” and he threw his head aside in a languishing manner—“Hope you're very well, Mrs. Marygold—that chair's the old lady—how dee doo, Mrs. Marygold—how's Bob?—no, not Bob—how is Mr. Robert?—then that bedpost's the old man—compliments to the old man—that wash-stand is the young ladies, all of a bunch—your most obedient, says I, in a sort of off-hand way—most obedient to the wash-stand, and a sort of a slide all round. Pooh! it's easy enough, if you go right at it—who's afraid? Ha! ha!” and Shiverton became excited, bowing about the room. “Dance! why yes, to be sure I will. Pleasure of dancing with Miss Slammerkin?—ho! ho! tolderol! tolderol! chassez across —swing corners—slambang! pigeon-wing!” Shiverton's operations in this matter were rather of the old school; more, it is to be presumed, from the dash of desperation that tinged his spirit at the time, than from any other cause; and so, forgetting, if he ever knew it, the easy, unambitious and nonchalant manner of the modern ball-room, he set arms and legs agoing with the whirligig vigour and expansive reach of a windmill. The floor creaked and trembled—the windows rattled and shook; but still he danced away with the concentrated energy of one who “had business would employ an age, and but a moment's time to do it in.” He was, in fact, and without being conscious of it, realizing a great moral and physiological truth. His mental uneasiness found relief in physical action, on the principle which renders the body restless when the mind is disturbed, that the superabundance of the nervous force may be diverted from our thoughts to our muscles. Care and bashfulness seemed to be driven away together. The rust flew off, and a momentary hardness and transient polish appeared. He upset the chair. “Mrs. Marygold's done for,” said he, in breathless exultation. Crash went the table. “Supper's over—let's waltz! Taglioni and Queen Victoria—who's afraid! I knew I only wanted to begin, to go ahead of D'Orsay!” and he flew round like a top, to the complete discomfiture of the “Dukedom of Hereford and those movables.” “Murder!—or fire!—or thieves!—or something!” screamed Mrs. Fitzgig, the landlady, as she awoke in trepidation from her slumbers, the more appalled because it was impossible to imagine what was the matter. Terror is never so terrific as when we do not know what terrifies us. “Boh!” cried in the dark, will unsettle the firmest nerves, because it has never yet been decided exactly what “Boh!” means. People will tremble and run at “Boh!” who do not shrink from surgery or from an unpaid bill. The uproar continued, and at last Mrs. Fitzgig, with her boarders, men, women and children, leaped from their beds and rushed, blanketed and sheeted, to the scene of action. “Shiverton Shakes is crazy—run for Doctor Slop!” “Shave his head!” said one. “Knock him down!” exclaimed another. “Law suz!” pathetically cried Mrs. Fitzgig, looking at the devastation—“What's all this?” “It's tea-party—it's hop—it's ball!” shouted Shiverton, for once grown bold, and seizing upon his landlady —“Why don't you jump along?—swing around—practice makes perfect!” The laughter, loud and long, which followed these explanatory exclamations, brought Shiverton Shakes to his senses, and awakened him from his dream of ball-room triumph, as if he had suddenly been subjected to the tranquillizing influence of a shower-bath. “Exercise—nothing but exercise—bad health—too much confined,” muttered he—“a man must have exercise.” “But two o'clock in the morning's not the time, is it? and breaking things is not the way, I guess,” said Mrs. Fitzgig, sulkily. Shiverton Shakes paid the damages, but the balance of ridicule was not so easily settled. It is a strange thing, too, that the rehearsal should be a subject of derision, when the deed itself is rather commendable 10* than otherwise. If a man is found making speeches to himself, people will regard it as a joke, and should he be discovered taking off his hat to his own reflection in the mirror, that he may bow with grace in the street, and perform his devoir to fair damsels with becoming elegance, why he would never hear the last of it. Always turn the key, and speak softly when practising gentlemanly deportment to supposititious society. If you experience a lack of preparatory drill in the art of making yourself peculiarly agreeable, go through your discipline in the vacant garret, and should there be no bolt to the entrance, keep your face to the door, that you may confront the sudden intruder, with a vacant countenance and the fragment of a tune, as if nothing in the world were the matter. Demosthenes himself must have felt what is now termed “flat,” when detected shoveling flints into his mouth, to turnpike his vocalities, and to Macadamise the way for his oratorical genius. To do such things is praiseworthy. To be surprised in the act, is the offence. The spirit of Lycurgus survives in the nineteenth century, and the Spartans were not alone in thinking that it is not the deed, but the discovery, which is to be reproved. Shakes found it so, when jeered for his social training. And, in referring to this popular contradiction, which asks for the thing, and in some sort derides one of the means of obtaining it, we cannot refrain from introducing, as an illustration, a colloquy in which our hero bore a part. It was in the evening, at Mrs. Fitzgig's—Shakes was forlornly looking into the fire—but few of the family remained, and Mr. Dashoff Uptosnuff, a gentleman probably of northern descent, but professing to know a thing or two in the west, twisted his moustache, adjusted his flowing locks, and ceased for a moment to admire his legs. “Shakes,” said Dashoff Uptosnuff, “this sheepishness of yours will never do, at your time of life.” “I know it,” replied Shakes, with a sigh; “it never did do, and I don't think it's going to do. But what am I to do?” “Do! where's the difficulty?—do like other people— do like me—do, and don't be done. I tell you what it is, Shakes, there's a double set of principles in this world, one of which is to talk about, and the other to act upon— one is preached, and the other is practised. You've got hold, somehow, of the wrong set—the set invented by the knowing ones, to check competition and to secure all the good things for themselves. That's the reason people are always praising modest merit, while they are pushing along without either the one or the other. You always let go, when anybody's going to take your place at table— you always hold back, when another person's wanting the last of the nice things on the dish. That's not the way— bow and nod and show your teeth with a fascination, but take what you want for all that. This is manners— knowing the world. To be polite, is to have your own way gracefully—other people are delighted at your style —you have the profit.” “But I'm ashamed—what would people think?” “Why, Shiverton Shakes, if you only learn to understand the hocus pocus of it, they'll think of you just what you wish them to think. Don't be afraid of other people —other people is a goose. Hav'n't you found that out yet? Who is ever afraid of people when he knows them well—lives in the same house with them? You're not afraid of Mrs. Fitzgig; you're not afraid of me—you're not afraid of the washerwoman—not much afraid, even when you owe her for the last quarter. Confidence is only carrying out the principle—look upon everybody as me, or Mrs. Fitzgig, or the washerwoman. That's the way to do. As for your not knowing people, it amounts to nothing—it's often an advantage—for then you may fairly conclude they don't know you. How are battles gained? Because the party who run away, don't know that their enemies were just about to do the same thing—they don't know that their opponents were as much scared as themselves. Look bluff, and the day's your own. Nobody sees beyond appearances.” “Yes, but I can't do as you advise—I think I can sometimes, when no person's by; but when I come to try it, I can't—I feel so—my heart bumps so—my tongue's so dry, and I always tumble over things and tread on somebody's toe. I'm sure to tread on somebody's toe.” “Shiverton, you're a melancholy victim to the errors of education and the wrong set of principles, or you wouldn't tread on other people's toes—not so they'd know it, even if you had to step over their heads. If you only understand how, you can do what you please. The style is all. Ah,” continued Dashoff Uptosnuff, falling into a philosophic reverie, “what a world of blunders is this! They've got free schools and high schools, and universities and colleges,—they learn to cipher—to read languages—to understand mathematics and all sorts of things—comparatively useless things—but who is taught confidence—that neat kind of confidence which don't look like confidence—who is taught to converse, when in that lies all the civil engineering of life, which shaves the mountain from our path, tunnels the rocks and lifts us to the top of the social Alleghanies? Who learns at school how to make a bow, or to get a wife with a hundred thousand dollars or upwards? Where, in short, is that professorship which shows us the road to success, and indicates how we are to live without work, the great secret at which we are all struggling to arrive? As things are managed now, we are soldiers sent to the battle before we have learned to tell one end of our muskets from the other; and before we have discovered where to insert the load and where to place the priming, the war is over and we are among the killed, wounded and missing. Is'nt it doleful?” “Very,” said Shiverton, mournfully. “Well, now, for my part, I don't see the trouble,” said Mrs. Fitzgig; “why can't a man buck up?” “Nor I,” added Miss Jemima Fitzgig, who wanted to be Mrs. something. “It is the easiest thing in the world to get along, especially among ladies,” and she glanced tenderly at Mr. Dashoff Uptosnuff. “You must make an effort, Shiverton—one plunge and all will be over—go to Marygold's determined on boldness. Sooner or later, you must begin. It is impossible to dodge in this way for ever.” What a happy thing it would be if the determination were the achievement—if “I will” were the consummation—if, by one potent screw upon the organ of firmness, the little troop of faculties which make up our identity, could be wheeled into the unshrinking and impenetrable Macedonian phalanx, and if there could be no uneasy intervention of doubtful thoughts between the firm resolve and its execution. “I will,” said Shiverton, and he did. He did—but how? Let us not anticipate. Let us sooner pause before ringing up for the catastrophe of this painful drama, and rather seek metaphysically to know why it was a painful history and why it had a catastrophe —why any of us have catastrophes—for catastrophe is not necessary to our nature. If the faculties were in equipoise, we should never fall—Shiverton Shakes would not have fallen. We are, to a certain extent, rope-dancers here below—Seiltanzers—Herr Clines; and there is truth in the Mahommedan supposition that we cross the gulf upon a bridge finer than a hair. Any internal force, therefore, in excess or in deficiency, swerves us from the right line, and we run the risk of being impinged upon an adverse catastrophical circumstance, having the melancholy preferment of serving to point a moral and adorn a tale. Our vices are our virtues running to riot and pushing into the extreme, and all human impulses are good, in subordination and in their place. It is their morbid, unwholesome condition which makes our trouble. There is no sinfulness in thirst, if the proper means are used to quench it; nor is ambition unholy, if it only seeks honourable and useful distinction among men. Acquisitiveness is derided; but a subdued acquisitiveness is requisite, if we would not be a burden to our friends and subject old age to the degradation of being a charge upon the public purse. Even anger—the combativeness and destructiveness of modern definition—is essential to our well-being, as a defensive means, and that the oppressor may fear to set his heavy foot upon us. We are, in short, good people enough in the constituents of our individuality—all the materials are respectable in themselves; it is the quantity of each which causes the disturbance. Too much courage makes the bully—too little shrinks into the coward. A modicum of self-esteem induces us to scorn meanness—with too large a share, our pride becomes an insult and an outrage. The love of approval gives amiability to our deportment; but it may run into perking vanity and ambling affectation. Happy they “whose blood and judgment are so well commingled,” that they can march with a steady step and have no reason for pausing analysis to learn why they stumble. Now the psychological ship of Shakes—the vessel which carried this Cæsar and his fortunes—was defective in its trim—the ballast was badly stowed—too much by the head or too much something else, which prevented it from working “shipshape and Bristol fashion.” His deference to “other people” had been nourished to an extent which cast a destructive shadow over his other faculties, and his firmness and self-reliance had probably left hollows in his pericranium. But it was not altogether that he placed no sufficient estimate upon himself—there were times—times apart—times of retiracy, when he felt “as good as you”—perhaps better, and it may be that it was an overweening desire to fill out his fancy sketch of himself—to be a sublime Shakes—the embodiment of his own conception—which gave such paralyzing force to the eye of the observer—that “Mrs. Grundy” whose criticism we all fear, more or less, and made him either shrink from the effort, or fail miserably when he did venture on the attempt. Was it at all thus with Shakes? There are such apparent contradictions in humanity. But who is “clairvoyant” enough to penetrate into the mental council-chamber, and discover what we scarce know ourselves? It was cold and dark, but yet a man in a cloak walked uneasily up and down the street. Lights beamed from the windows and carriages drove up to the door of a mansion, upon which his earnest regards seemed to be fixed. “Now, I will,” said he, pausing under the trees; “no, not yet—I can wait a little while longer. “I wish it was to-morrow, or some time next week,” muttered he. “I wish I was a chimney-sweep, for they are all a-bed—I wish I was that limping fellow with a bad cold, crying oysters—he don't wear white kids—I almost wish I had an attack of apoplexy, and somebody was rolling me along on a wheelbarrow. “Now for it!” and he dashed desperately up the steps and seized the bell-handle with unflinching fingers—but he did not pull—like the renowned “King of France,” he walked gently down again. “I think I should like a little hot whisky punch,” sighed he; “very strong whisky, and remarkable hot punch.” It is an anti-temperance weakness, no doubt; but still there are passages in most men's lives when they feel the very want expressed by Shiverton Shakes—when they would “like a punch”—a strong punch—to make them go. But such punches are apt to become bad punches— to punch out one's brains. If you cannot get along without punch, you had better not go at all. “But no—who's afraid?—Uptosnuff will laugh if I don't—here goes!” and the bell rang loudly. Shiverton Shakes had committed an error—nothing daunts a man of his infirmity more than unaccustomed garments. One who is at ease in a familiar coat, feels embarrassed in a new dress. Shakes had caused his hair to be curled—it pulled in every direction. His white gloves were rather of the tightest—his satin stock had not yet the hang of his neck—his pumps uncomfortably usurped the place of his expanded boots—his coat had only come home that afternoon. He had practised to dance, but it was not a full dress rehearsal. His white waistcoat and his snowy gloves were ever in his eye; he saw himself continually, and there is nothing worse than to see one's self, under circumstances of restraint— to be reminded all the time that yourself is there. Shiverton had that species of consciousness which poetic souls have attributed to the poker. He felt like a catapult, without hinge or joint. He was cold at the extremities. “If nobody knew me, I wouldn't care so much,” quoth he. But Uptosnuff was unexpectedly there—there before him. “Now, Shiverton—your respects to the hostess—graceful and rather affectionate.” “I wish he hadn't said that,” growled Shiverton, as he made his way, as if travelling on eggs, through the gayly dressed throng to Mrs. Marygold, who stood in all the splendors of matronly embellishment. “Mrs. Marygold—I'm very—how d'ye—hope you're —good evening—how's—yes, ma'am,” ejaculated Shiverton, spasmodically. “Ah, ha! Shiverton! rejoiced to see you,” said Mr. Marygold, a jocular gentleman, with a mulberry nose; “got over your bashfulness, I suppose.” “Ye—e—s,” responded Shiverton, with a mechanical effort at a smile, in which the mouth went into attitude, curving toward the ears, while the rest of the face kept its rigid, stony appearance. “Glad of it—plenty of pretty girls here—come, let me make you acquainted.” “No, thank you—I'd rather—” “Now's your time, Shiverton,” whispered Uptosnuff, “keep it up—don't flinch.” “Mr. Shakes, bashful Mr. Shakes, Miss Simpkins— very desirous of dancing with you. Didn't you say so?” observed the jocular Mr. Marygold. “No—yes—I—oh!—very—it's getting warm,” and Shiverton Shakes sat forcibly down upon the elderly Mrs. Peachblossom, who shrieked aloud, while Shakes sprang up with amazement: “just as I expected—right on somebody's toe!” “Never mind—persevere,” whispered Uptosnuff. “Nobody's hurt. Now be bold—it's much easier than being timid.” “I will,” said Shiverton, drawing down his waist-coat; 11 “I will—keep near me, but don't look at me—” and Shiverton led his partner to the dance, resolved at all hazards to try the advice of his friend. But when the dance began, he suddenly felt as if ten thousand eyes were upon him—his little knowledge of the subject, picked up “long time ago,” deserted from his memory. It was all confusion, and every attempt to guide his erratic steps made the confusion worse confounded. “Now, Mr. Shakes”—“there, Mr. Shakes,” and “here, Mr. Shakes,” only served to mystify his perceptions still more deeply, as, driven to desperate courses, he danced frantically about, in the vain hope that lucky chance might put him upon that undiscovered and apparently undiscoverable clue to the labyrinth, to which, it was plain, direction could not lead him. “Whew!—Uptosnuff,” panted Shiverton, during a prelude to a new complication of dance and suffering,— when the tamborine rang out, and when the yellow man in ear-rings was evidently inhaling volumes of the atmosphere, to aid him in calling figures in that as yet unknown tongue and untranslated language which dancers alone comprehend. “Uptosnuff, I can't stand this—what shall I do?” “I cannot tell—did you ever try to faint?” replied Uptosnuff. “Yah-yay—doo yandleming foo-yay!” shouted the yellow man in ear-rings. “Jang-jingle—r-a-a-n-g foodle,” said the tamborine. “Shaw-shay!” If Shiverton could have reached the yellow man, there would have been an end to the ear-rings; but as this was out of the question, he shut his eyes and set his arms and legs in action with an unlimited power of attorney, and, though he went many ways, it happened, with a perversity peculiar to Terpsichorean tyros, that he never hit upon the right way, at the right time; for, in these matters, the right soon becomes wrong. The company began to gather round, to witness this extraordinary and extemporaneous performance. “'Pon my soul, if I don't think it's animal magnetism,” remarked a scientific looking individual, with a bald head and green spectacles. He's mesmerized—he's under the influence of the fluid.” “I wish I was,” thought Shiverton, as he bounded like a kangaroo, catching his rearward foot in the flowing robes of Miss Simpkins, and oversetting the “one lady forward,” as he himself came lumbering to the floor. All was chaos. “Intoxicated!” “Insane!” “Insufferable!” “Infamous!” “Satisfaction!” said whiskers. Shiverton scrambled to his feet, and stared wildly around. “Shiverton Shakes, I never could have believed that you would have come to my house, in such a condition,” said Mrs. Marygold, in awful tones. “Shiverton Shakes, I've done with you for ever,” said the old gentleman. “My friend will wait on you in the morning,” remarked whiskers. “Beat a retreat, Shiverton—you're Waterloo'd,” hinted Uptosnuff. “Sauve qui peut. It's too late to faint now—why didn't you lie still, to be picked up?” Shiverton charged like a conscript of the French republic, without much science, but with inflexible will, at what he thought to be an open door—it was a costly mirror; but, though a deceptive appearance, it did not “take him in”—he rebounded, amid the crash of glass. Shrieks of dismay arose on every side; but Shiverton, having now a clearly defined object in view, “bent up each corporal agent to this terrible feat,” and overthrew all impediment, including stout Mrs. Marygold and sundry other obstacles which were in the way of his recoil, to say nothing of John with the refreshments, who was thus deluged in lemonade, and the cabman at the door, who was summarily taught how to execute a backward summerset down a flight of steps. Shiverton reached home, breathless, hatless, cloakless, and in despair—a melancholy example of the perilous consequences of endeavouring to “assume a virtue, if you have it not.” “A man must be brought up to it,” soliloquized Shiverton, when he had recovered coolness enough to think, and had kicked his kid gloves indignantly into a corner; “at least, I'm sure that this spontaneous combustion sort of way of going at it, will never answer for me. If I could now, little by little, just dip in a foot—wet my head—slide in gradually—become accustomed and acquainted by degrees, and not be spoken to or bothered at first—begin where I wasn't known, or where people don't laugh at every thing so confoundedly. But no—I'm done for—this blow up at Marygold's—I can never show my head again,” and he buried himself in the blankets, as if he never more wished to be looked upon by the surrounding world. This was the first and last attempt of Shiverton Shakes to gain a footing in society. He held no more intercourse with Dashoff Uptosnuff; for, although he admitted the correctness of that individual's theory, still he had an overwhelming consciousness of inability to carry it into effect. He bought him a turning lathe, and made knick-knacks in the long winter evenings, smoked cigars, and tried to read “Gibbon's Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire.” He would have liked to have a wife, but the process of getting one was too much for his nervous sensibilities; so he dined at an ordinary and made his own tea and toast, being literally and truly an “unexpressed idea”—an undeveloped capability.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">11* THE BOYS THAT RUN WITH THE ENGINE. We are deceived. There is not so much inequality of talent as the world supposes. From the earliest ages, there has been a conspiracy of caste, to blind and to mislead the mass of mankind, by giving a monopoly of fame to those who stand in certain positions. To all the rest, renown has been denied, and they have been content with a lot, not inevitable, but cunningly imposed; and thus the world, at every period, has been converted into a crowd of “stupid starers”—shouters for self-constituted idols, when, if the truth were known, thousands of those who submit to be lookers-on, and to be shut from the historic page altogether, not only possess genius equal to that of the hero, but, actually, albeit in an humbler field, give unhonoured manifestations of superior ability. The difference is, that one man is framed, gilded, and hung up against the wall, to be looked at and admired, while another plods along the dusty highway, without attracting notice. An accident has been wanting. A concurrence of circumstances has brought about greatness in one instance, when, in the other, the individual did not happen to be within range of the breeze of fortune at the proper moment; and hence, his sails flap idly against the mast, while the happier ship proudly careers across the seas. Luck may not be a very euphonical word; but there is much in luck. Instances of course arise, in which the individual has not the innate force to improve his luck, and is, therefore, rather overwhelmed than benefitted by it. If a man be crank, and lack ballast, he is swamped by the prosperous gale; but there are many others who lag behind, only because they need the external impetus which has been fatal to him. If, then, any one stands before our eyes, sparkling with reputation and glittering with glory—like Gesler's cap upon a pole, to which all are required to bow—let us shade our eyes from the effulgence, and do honour rather to the luck, than to him who has been the subject of it. Let us enquire whether it has been his own strength of limb, or the brawny muscle of propitious fortune, which has borne him up the steep, and let us pay our respects accordingly. Glory, in the main, is a delusion. It is too often rather a concession on our part, than a merit in him to whom it is accorded. It is not so much the talent we admire, as the chance which gave room for its exhibition. The same elements of character might be at our side for a life-time, and receive no appreciation. It is only when they are successfully displayed in the arena peculiarly dedicated to glory, that our wonder is moved. The dexterity of a Talleyrand may retail dry goods, but who writes the history of him that wields a yard-stick? The strategic talent of a Napoleon may be evinced in robbing the “watermillion” patches of New Jersey; but where is the O'Meara to note the sayings of one who expiates his offences in a county jail? Humanity is unjust to itself. If genius be the thing to be admired, why should it command our homage more readily when attired in feathers and embroidery, than when skulking in rags and tatters? Are the constituents of heroism less worthy when their owner is in the hands of a constable, than when he is incarcerated in an island prison like St. Helena? Never credit it. We are fools to our false views and erroneous estimates. We are struck by the circumstance, and not by the essential. The ragamuffin's head has not been adorned with a laurel wreath—he never, perhaps, caused an illumination, except when dragged from his thieving ambush in the coal-hole, by the light of a single candle;— but analyze his actions, put his motives and his achievements into the crucible of philosophic reflection, and then determine whether, in a happier sphere, he would not have stolen “crowns” where he now filches shillings, and have appropriated empires, instead of “hooking” boots from an entry. Is it not true, then, that we esteem the lucks and chances of a man, much more than we reverence the man himself? Why, even when hero meets hero, he receives the applause who carries off the victory, when it is plainly apparent that accident alone was decisive of the conflict. A chance shot disables the frigate,—the bugler is killed, and does not call “boarders to repel boarders,”—an aid-de-camp fails to convey orders,—a Grouchy does not bring up the reserve in time,—the success is determined by some petty failure in the details of a masterpiece of skill, and he is hailed the great one who stumbles into triumph. Blind luck draws the bow-string round the neck of genius, and the goose pecks out the eyes of the eagle. The same injustice prevails throughout. Why should familiarity breed contempt, but that we have what may be called a proclivity to humbug—a disposition to be deceived? And yet it will always be found, that no man is a hero to his valet-de-chambre—no, nor to his wife, his children, or his friends, except in some rare instances. Who can believe that Peter, by our side,—Peter, whom we have known from childhood upwards,—Peter, whom we have rebuked, rebuffed and perhaps cuffed,—who can think that Peter is a genius? And why not Peter?—who is inevitably better than Peter? Warriors and statesmen? They were not born warriors and statesmen. They were once little Peters, probably Peters not so promising as yours. Scurvy little Peters, crying on the stairs—rebuked, rebuffed and cuffed, no doubt, like him. But we know Peter—know him too well, and seem to lose the power of appreciation by that intimate knowledge; and in this respect, as in all others, it is distance and ignorance combined, which creates our astonishment. Thus it is, indeed, that they err, who wish to see the great ones close at hand; and thus the great ones err, who suffer themselves unnecessarily to be seen close at hand. He who really desires to enjoy the enchantment of the drama, is not wise in thrusting himself behind the scenes. The tyrant does not become more awful, when it is observed that his portentous moustache and terrific eye-brow are the product of a burnt cork; nor are the dancing-girls a whit more full of fascination, when it appears that their roseate blushes are the quintessence of brick-dust. And what literary lion is there, in the long list of those who have visited our shores, who did not lose his mane by the adventure?—who did not sink in public estimation, and gradually decline from the majesty of a quadruped, into the ordinary two-legged condition of the indigenous man? Where, in fact, is the exception? Not one. Familiarity is the “Lion King.” It reduces all such rampant creatures to the mere household standard, and puts them to sleep before the fire. But all these things are nevertheless wrong. Genius is genius, whether the chance be afforded or not;—it is still genius, and the same genius, whether its field be small or great;—it is genius, notwithstanding, however close it may be in our intimacy, and the truth of our prelude may be demonstrated in all its branches, by a slight recurrence to the history of “The Boys that run with the Engine.” They are but imperfect observers of human nature, who look abroad and look upwards, to note character in its more striking developments. If their study is man, the true materials for research are best found close at hand. History is a falsifier. All actions, when viewed from a distance, are seen through a distorting medium. The so-called chronicles of the times, are but the mirage of the desert, in which the parties represented often appear upside down, one swelling to a gigantic stature, while another dwindles to dwarfish proportions. Motives are mistaken and results are exaggerated, and he who hopes, in this way, to arrive at knowledge through the medium of written records, must, by dint of preparatory study on the living subject, have learned to separate the reality from the fictitious. Cabinets and camps are well enough, to be sure, if we are on our guard against the deceptive glare which is almost invariably thrown around them— if we are gifted with that rare discrimination which considers the man himself, and not his embroidery; but, in the generality of cases, it is our weakness to regard as fine birds, all poultry which has been lucky enough to trig itself out in fine feathers, and hence we are led into errors innumerable,—our swans are geese, and the turkey is often degraded to the rank of a buzzard. If, however, we turn from courts and camps and cabinets, to the engine houses of a great metropolis, we shall there find action, and the springs to action,—action as energetic, and the springs to action as forcible, as are to be seen any where,—laid open to our view, without gilding and without guile. Here is manhood in its opening flower, —in the summer morning of its restlessness. The untrimmed colt of aspiring ambition prances upon this plain; a colt which may hereafter be the war-horse, with his neck clothed in thunder—a more striking adornment, as must readily be admitted, than even one of Tennent's best fitting stocks, in all the glory of shining satin. Diplomacy may perhaps be expanding in this group, little restrained by the weak embraces of a thread-bare jacket, and, by its side, stands that emulation, which may lead to the pinnacle of fame, though at present content with carrying a torch, with bearing the massive weight of a branch-pipe, with having the head of a rope, or with having the hand of control upon the tongue of the carriage. All propelling qualities are developed here, and “the boys that run with the engine” have within them every faculty necessary, in a more polished condition, for the conduct of an empire. And it is for these reasons, that “the boys that run with the engine,” are deemed worthy of being sketched by the cunning hand of the artist, and of having their mental characteristics pourtrayed in an essay especially devoted to the subject. Fastidious refinement may turn its head aside in scorn, to luxuriate upon the historical novel or the metaphysical romance, to contemplate representations of man as he is not, and of woman as she ought not to be; but these things are passing away, and it is to be the glory of our time to “catch the manners living as they rise,”—to look upon nothing as beneath its notice which contributes to modify the dispositions of the age. Who, let us ask, is more of a “feature” in the countenance of the times, as they exist hereabouts, than these juvenile Rosicrucians—these Ghebers—these modern Fire-worshippers? Who stand out more prominently on the face of things than they who, by night and by day, sweep like the wind along the streets, and, by their obstreperous clamour, prevent even echo from indulging in a protracted nap? Who are more active, more courageous, more constantly on the alert,—who make more noise in the world, or force their way more readily through every obstruction, causing all people and all things to give way before them, than “the boys that run with the engine?” Who are more frequently heard, more often felt, or more continually seen than these skimmers of the street, and are they not to find a place in the portraiture of the period? It would be a gross dereliction of duty to suffer them to pass unheeded. The “spirit of fire,” which early seizes upon a considerable portion of the youth of cities, is so far from being properly subject to those who have that limited species of control over them, which is accorded to parents and guardians, that perhaps it may be said, there is no other branch of insubordination which causes so much trouble and uneasiness. To the “boss,” whose apprentices have reached the state of development necessary for the reception of the fever, an alarm of fire is a perfect horror—not because his sympathies with the probable sufferer are excessive—not because he mourns over the ragings of the destructive element; but because he knows that, under such circumstances, his authority is neutralized and negatived—that his influence is so far gone that “moral suasion” will not keep his boys to their work, and that, if he expects that the shop is not to be left to take care of itself, he must prevent its depopulation by bringing the strong arm in play. To lock the door is not sufficient, while windows remain practicable, and even should the windows be hermetically sealed, egress by the chimney would not be thought too much of a feat to meet the call of paramount duty. Should the alarm come in the night, it is in vain that the “old man”—all superiors are “old men,” in modern phraseology, and our standing in that respect is measured by rank, not years— has made all fast and gone chuckling to bed, with the key under his pillow. He forgets that sheds and fences and out-houses are as available to intrepidity as a staircase, and that “the boy that runs with the engine” can travel over the exterior of a house with as little embarrassment as if the laws of gravitation exercised no influence over him— that, with his jacket under his arm and his boots slung about his neck, no denizen of the forest can run up perpendiculars more cleverly than he; and, while the aforesaid “boss” notes the heavy eyes and nodding heads which hang during the day so listlessly over their task, he never arrives at the true secret until he discovers that “there was a fire last night.” Little did he dream— poor unsuspicious soul!—when the midnight bell struck on his ear, and he turned him again to sleep, after ascertaining the key to be safe in its snug position—that Tom and Dick and Ben, and all the rest, were off in triumph, and that the energies which should have been expended in his service, according to the articles of apprenticeship, had been exhausted in extinguishing far distant flames. He never thought that those hoarse yells, which broke his rest with momentary dismay, emanated from most familiar voices, nor that the unintelligible, but none the less fearful on that account, “waugh-baugh-wulla-balloo!” which sounded so dreadfully before his door, mingled with the clanging of the bell and the fitful glancing of torches, was a derisive cry, uttered for his especial edification, by one of those whom he believed still to be slumbering in the garret. Nor when at breakfast time, he told the lads how loud was the alarm last night, and how the signal indicated that the danger lay “nor-west,” did he mark the cunning wink which stole from eye to eye, in mockery of the ignorance that would give them information upon a subject so familiar. Why the lads are all so harsh in their tones, he cannot imagine, unless it be that the influenza is about; but he does think that the variety of soil upon their boots, indicates the fact of more previous travel than he was aware of. At such times also, there are apt to be unaccountable deficiencies in the quantity of cold provisions in the cellar, which are scarcely to be attributed to the gastronomic performances of a single cat. The amateur fireman, on the return from service, is apt to 12 feel the calls of appetite, and as he is, as it were, a principle essential to the well-being of real estate, he takes due care to nourish himself accordingly. The learned may not perhaps have taken due cognisance of the fact, but, in some divisions of knowledge, the extent of information obtained by “the boys that run with the engine,” is well calculated to move our wonder. The amount of their acquaintance with local topography, qualifies them to write articles for the Encyclopedia. Not a court, lane or alley—not a hole nor a corner, in the vast circumference of the town, which is not considerably more familiar to them than a glove. They are the Plutarchs of fire-plugs, knowing the history of each, and the comparative merits of all. At every conflagration within their experience, they can tell what engines were in service, what hose companies had “attachments,” and how many feet of hose were brought in play—who was earliest on the ground, and obtained the most effective position, with many other particulars with which the world, greatly to its disadvantage, is never likely to become conversant. If it were the nature of “the boys” to write, the annals of the parish, as they would record them, could not fail to form a whole library in itself. On the score of emulation too, these lads are not to be surpassed by the most ambitious of ancient or modern times. Other people are regardful of creature comforts. They will break away from the most interesting employment, because dinner is ready, or because the hour has come when they are in the habit of imbibing tea. When the time arrives for going to bed, they cease from their labours and get them to repose. They are slaves to routine, and must travel continually in the accustomed circle, or they are wretched in proportion to the extent to which they have deviated; but it is not so with “the boys that run with the engine.” The eccentricity is their delight. Rest, sleep, food, are nothing to them when weighed in the balance with the pleasure of dragging a heavy machine through the mud; and, that they may be first at the engine house, they have often been known, on the frostiest night, to leap from their warm couches, rushing forth with their garments in a bundle, to dress when they had reached their destination. Can disinterestedness, generous emulation and glowing ambition, attain a more exalted climax than this? It does not lie within the range of possibility, and the higher value will be affixed to it, when it is remembered that many of these “young youths” have quite another character in the more ordinary affairs of life. In matters of mere domestic concernment, they who will labour so strenuously in the cause of the engine, are, in frequent instances, found to be in no way addicted to excessive exertion. A night alarm will draw those from their beds, who are not easily enticed therefrom at the call of business; and the most lethargic lounger that ever dozed when he should have been waking, or that ever skulked when work was at hand, will cheerfully encounter any toil, if it happen to be connected with the duties of the hose house. The leading characteristic, however, of the class to which we refer, is valour—enterprise, energy and valour. Where could a nobler combination be discovered? Next to a fire, the most glorious object to their view, is a fight. But when both unite—when a fight is found at a fire, and when the fire lights the way to a fight, who are happier than “the boys that run with the engine?” And reason good, if it be true that martial heroism is a matter worthy of our aspirations. The elements of war conjoin. The flames crackle—the fierce hurrah goes up —columns charge—the heavy artillery comes lumbering through the press—shrieks, groans, imprecations and denunciations, are mingled thick with blows and thrusts. The glittering trumpet takes the place of the flashing sabre, and quick as lightning, cuts “six” upon the head and shoulders of the foe, stretching him senseless in the kennel. The massive “spanner” makes short work of the stoutest tarpaulin, and though the combatants may long for the bullet, yet those who have had much experience in the force of projectiles, have discovered that but for the name of the thing, brickbats are likely to answer just as well. All the joy of conflict is called forth in such a field. It is not the distant and cold-blooded courtesy of scientific manœuvre, where legs usurp the prerogative of arms—it is the forlorn hope, the escalade, the storm, the hand-to-hand engagement, developing “the worth of the individual” and giving scope to personal prowess—this is what invests it with fascination for the engine boy; and what more could be accomplished, even at a Waterloo, than to be picked up for dead and carried home on a shutter? The essentials of glory are every one attainable in such a struggle, and it is but that short-sightedness on the part of the world, to which we have already alluded, which prevents the proper distribution of praise. It is true that the scarred veteran obtains no pension to compensate for his knocks; but does that argue that they did not smart as much as wounds that are better paid for? The victor receives neither title nor riband; but, in all likelihood, he has been quite as cruel, brutal and oppressive, to the extent of the opportunity, as if he were honoured with both. In all associations, whether of men, boys or sheep, there is invariably a bell-wether—a master spirit; one who affords colour to their modes of thought, and furnishes aim for their actions—who warms their spirit when their courage flags—who lends them enterprise when they falter, and gives concentration to their efforts. In an extended sphere, such individuals bestow character on nations and on ages, leaving their impress upon all, and, in a more confined circle, the personal stamp, though not so widely spread, is made with equal distinctness. In the group which forms the subject of our story, such a one will be seen in the person of Hickey Hammer,—he who leans against the wall, with club in hand and with a most majestic sternness in his countenance—he, with the game-cock look all over him—he, whose combativeness and destructiveness are so prominent as to render it unavoidable to wear his hat aslant, that, on one side at least, these organs may be comparatively cool, to ensure safety to his friends—he, Hickey Hammer, who has fierceness enough in his composition to furnish a whole menagerie, and yet leave sufficient surplus to animate and constitute a warrior. Were there ample swing for Hickey Hammer— had we the delights of civil war, or the charms of a revolution, there would be one more added to the list of heroes, and another picture would figure in the print shops. But as it is, Hickey contrives to find some vent for his inspiration, by getting up a quarrel about once a day, and nourishing it into a genial combat—otherwise, he would explode from the attrition of his own fiery spirits. Hickey Hammer “runs with the engine,” because it goes to fight fire, and he almost wishes that he were a bucket of water, to grapple more directly with so fierce a foe. So irresistible is his call to contend, that he is obliged to gratify it, whether there be an object present or not. When he goes to bed at night, or when he rises in the morning, the exercise of his muscles is an invariable concomitant. He strikes the air, parries imaginary blows, and passes through all the action of a “heady fight,” with an energy that is really alarming. Every door in the house bears the imprint of his knuckles, and the very tables are splintered by the weight of his fist. The “cocked hat” is to him the beau ideal of shapes, and he labours to knock all 12* things into that antiquated resemblance. Should old time venture within reach of his arm, the existing moment would at once be converted, by a similar process, into “the middle of next week.” It will be seen that one of his devoted admirers is endeavouring to tell him a story about a Mr. Tompkins, who had recently distinguished himself at a fire, and that Hickey Hammer listens with his usual scornful impatience. “Tompkins!” said Hickey, on the occasion referred to; “well, and who is Tompkins, your great Tompkins? Now I'll bring this thing to a pint at once; for when there's so much talk, there's never a bit of fight.” “I didn't say any thing about fight,” was the trembling remonstrance of the admirer. “But you cracked Tompkins up, didn't you, and Tompkins pretends to be great shakes, don't he? What's that but fight, I should like to know? Now the thing, as I said before, is just this, and no more than this. I don't pretend to be much; but can Tompkins lick me? Could he lick me any way, fair stand up and no closing in, or could he do it, rough and tumble and no letting up? Talking about people is nonsense— this is the how, to find out what a chap is good for. Fetch on your Tompkins, and tie my right hand behind me, if you like—that's all—yes, and he shall have six cracks at me before I begin. I'm not particular about odds. When you see this Tompkins, tell him so, and ask if he or his big brother, if he has got one, or any of the family, boss and all, would like to knock a chip off my hat any afternoon. I'll clear them of the law. I want them to do it—I'd give 'em something if they'd do it. Just feel my arm—hickory and gum logs! Talk of your Tompkinses! Who did they ever lick? I don't even believe they were ever taken up because they were going to fight. Only wait till there's an alarm some Sunday, and then show me Tompkins, if you want to see a man forget what he had for dinner.” In fact, Hickey Hammer considers himself sent here on a special mission, to accommodate all customers, and whenever he hears of a new comer, his first inquiry is as to the individual's appreciation of his own prowess— whether, like Tompkins, “he thinks he can lick Hickey Hammer.” If he does think so, and ventures to say so, why, Mr. Hammer sees to it that the difference of opinion may be settled on the spot. So great is his love of truth, that he cannot bear to leave any one in error upon a point of such interest and importance. Had Hammer lived in earlier times, he would have been the very flower of chivalry—at present, he only rejoices in the distinction of being “a bird.” When squabbles are scarce and riots are a little out of fashion, such events being somewhat epidemic, Mr. Hammer, following the example of other great men, makes the circumstance to suit himself, and, gathering a flock of pupils and proselytes around him, often sets forth on what he calls the “grand rounds.” This process consists in taking an evening ramble from one engine house to another, to have a glance at the collection of boys there assembled; for each establishment has its separate set of votaries, who believe that all virtue resides in their gang, and that all excellence is combined in their engine. If there are enough present to render the scene impressive, Hickey Hammer sternly confronts the strangers, and, with a lowering aspect, thus addresses them: “Well, my lads, where's the bully?” “What bully?” is the natural response, from those who are yet to be indoctrinated into Mr. Hammer's mode of doing business. “I want to see the bully of this company—you've got a bully, I suppose. Everybody says so. Where is he? Tell him to come to supper,” and, that there may be no mistake as to his meaning, Hickey throws himself into position, dealing forth experimental blows in the very face of the bystanders, so nicely calculated as to distance, that they are enabled to feel the “whiff and wind,” without experiencing personal detriment, the insult being assault enough, though rather constructive than positive, and having no taint of battery. If a bully be forthcoming, which is not often the case upon an emergency so sudden and unexpected, the consequences are obvious. The combat either comes off at once, or is fixed for a more convenient spot and a subsequent meeting. But, should the assailed party be without a champion, Hickey challenges any two, or more, if they like to undertake him, and this mode of proceeding generally results in a set-to all round, requiring a constabulary suppression, and furnishing material for many a tale of traditionary narrative, in which Hickey Hammer figures as the hero; in consequence whereof, all “the boys that run with the engine,” of which Hickey Hammer may be regarded as the patron, are Hickey Hammerites in word and deed. They roll their trowsers up higher than other boys—they roar louder than other boys; they take the engine out on Sundays, and, if they cannot get a fight in any other way, they dash deliberately into every “carriage” that passes. Rare boys are “the boys that run with the engine”—the choice and master-spirits of the time.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">JACK SPRATTE'S REVENGE. A PISCATORIAL EPISODE. Do you know Mrs. Brownstout? Everybody ought to know Mrs. Brownstout; for Mrs. Brownstout is in the market—not for sale—matrimonially speaking, her market was made long ago, and thence was derived the hearty appellation in which she rejoices. But, as she occupies a conspicuous stand in the Fish Market, it is therefore presumed that everybody knows Mrs. Brownstout, who presides over the eventful destinies of shad and “pearch” and rockfish. That is, they know her “superfishally,” if we may be allowed the expression— in her commodities and in her outward appearance. When she passes by, they possess that degree of acquaintance with her exterior, to enable them to say “there goes Mrs. Brownstout;” and when she is seated at her stand— strange perversity of human nature, that it is always sure to sit at its stand!—people are positive that it is really Mrs. Brownstout. They recognise her by her gait, or by her costume, or by the piscatorial circumstances that surround her, which is about as much as the world in general knows of any body. But the moral Mrs. Brownstout—the historical Mrs. Brownstout—the metaphysical Mrs. Brownstout—in short, the spiritual Mrs. Brownstout, as contra-distinguished from the apparent Mrs. Brownstout, who merely sells her fishes and takes your money, why, what does society at large know of her? To the popular eye, she counts one in the sum total of humanity —a particle, and nothing more, in the vast conglomeration of the breathing universe. There is no perception of her mental identity—her intellectual idiosyncrasy attracts no attention—her past and her future are not inquired into—the Mrs. Brownstout retrospective, and the Mrs. Brownstout prospective, are equally disregarded, so that those ambitious of shad may find her to be the Mrs. Brownstout present; and thus the life of this estimable lady, like the lives of most of us, is narrowed down to the single point of immediate action—she and we are important only when it happens that our services are wanted. Our story—who has not got a story?—all our beings, doings and sufferings—our loves, hopes, successes and disappointments—all the trouble we have taken—the vexations we have endured—the triumphs we have achieved—who that encounters us in the street, ever thinks of them, or reflects that each of us, as we pass on our winding way, is a volume of exquisite experiences, bound in calf, and well worthy of the closet perusal? Not one, of all the vast multitude which throngs the path; and hence it is that the world, collectively considered, is more distinguished by folly than by wisdom, learning nothing from the problems that have already been solved, but preferring to stumble onward, from the beginning to the end, without borrowing a ray of light from the lanterns of those who have gone before. But it has been resolved that Mrs. Brownstout shall not be sacrificed in this unceremonious manner—that some passages of her existence shall be snatched from oblivion, to amuse or instruct, as the case may be, at least a portion of those into whose hands our pages may be destined to fall. For Mrs. Brownstout, notwithstanding the energetic expression of the outward woman, has had her share of the disasters which seem inevitable to the susceptible temperament. She, too, has had her “trials of the heart,” and has felt that though the poets seem to think that the sphere of young love's gambols is chiefly located “among the roses,” he may yet exercise much potency when playing among the fishes. There is no scale armour against the darts of Cupid, and, however steeled against such impressions the fair one may be, it is found, sooner or later, that she falls a prey to the tender passion. It is an admitted fact, made evident by repeated observation, that this world is full of people—men people and women people—and that there are some among both, who set out and travel to a considerable distance on their earthly journey, upon the self-sustaining principle of celibacy, in a heroic effort not to be bothered with appendages, forgetting that, by a singular provision of nature, their proper condition is that of being bothered, and that, though they cannot see it, they must be bothered, to be at all comfortable. When we are alone, we are not bothered; yet who likes to be alone? “Better dwell in the midst of alarms, Than reign in this horrible place,” said Selkirk, in default of the noise of children and of his wife's “alarms,” and Selkirk had learned that stagnation is a tiresome piece of work. A few of those, to whom reference is made, protract their restless and uneasy experiment of trying to live a quiet unperplexed life, in which they are unquiet, and very much perplexed, until the period for all human experiment is over. But the great majority fail for lack of nerve, and retract, from a late discovery of the truth. Your Benedicks and Beatrices are almost sure to participate in the lot of those delineated by the first of dramatists—they are certain, somehow or other, to sink into the very calamity against which they formerly protested, and, in an unguarded hour, malignant fate delights to betray them to the common weakness. To some extent, it was the fortune of Mrs. Brownstout to be a living illustration of the truth of this principle. In her maiden days, Miss Felicia Phinney laughed at the importunities of her numerous admirers. Having early gone into the fish business, she was confident in her own resources, and felt but little disposed to sink to a secondary place in the firm; and, therefore, “the gentlemen in waiting” each experienced a rebuff, so sharply administered, that they were but little disposed to put themselves again in the way of being similarly astonished—as she had a method of conducting herself little calculated to mollify the disappointment experienced upon such occasions. One night—it was a lovely night, during a warm spell which succeeded a “cold snap,” in the early part of the spring—shad were selling at seventy-five cents, and were scarce at that—the moon shone sweetly upon the chimney-tops—the fire-plugs, which were lucky enough to be on the north side of the street, were tinged and tinted with lines of fairy silver, and the beams of softened light played with romantic effect upon the craggy sides and rough fastnesses of the curb-stones. A balmy southern breeze sighed through the streets and loitered round the corners in lazy luxury, whispering soft nonsense in the ears of the somnolent Charleys, as they dreamily indulged in beatific visions of hot coffee and buckwheat cakes. All nature, including the brickbats and paving-stones, seemed to be wrapped in happy repose. The dogs barked not; even the cats had ceased to be vocal, and when any of these nocturnal wanderers appeared, it was plain from their stealthy step and subdued deportment, that they, too, felt the influence of the hour, and were unwilling to disturb the magnificent but tranquil harmony of the picture. It was, in short, a very fine night, particularly for the season, and, though used by the undiscriminating many for the mere domestic purposes of snoring slumber, for which the coarser kind of night would answer just as well, yet this especial night was worthy of a more elevated fate; and it may be regarded as a great pity that such nights as these do not come in the daytime, when they would be better seen and more thoroughly admired—as sleep, for the most part, is imperative, and as there are but few of us who can manage its performance with our eyes open. The main object of nights of this description, taking it for granted that every thing has its purpose, is to soften the heart—to render it flexible, malleable, and susceptible to the softer impressions. The sun, for instance, melts the ice, and gives plasticity to many descriptions of candy; but its warmest rays are ineffective, so far as the sympathies of the soul are concerned. No one is apt to fall in love at mid-day, or is much disposed to a declaration of passion, at three o'clock of a sunny afternoon. Existence, at these periods, is, in the main, altogether practical and unimaginative—good enough, no doubt, for buying and selling, and the eating of dinners; but not at all calculated to elicit the poetry of the affections. Whereas your moonlight evenings, when the frost is out of the ground, play Prometheus to sentiment, and, when the patient is not addicted to cigars and politics, both of which are antagonistical to this species of refinement, are sure to induce the bachelor to think that his condition is incomplete, and that there are means by which he might be made considerably happier. Thus it is that “our life is twofold”—that before tea we are one person, and that after this interesting event, we are somebody else. It was on such an evening as we have attempted somewhat elaborately to describe, and it was under such a state of circumstances as we have incidentally alluded to, that Jack Spratte escorted Miss Felicia Phinney home from a tea party, given among themselves by the fish-merchants. Jack Spratte had been as merry as a “grigge” throughout the entertainment. He had danced and he had sung—he had played “pawns” and “Copenhagen” 13 —he had “sighed in a corner”—he had loved his love with a “C,” because she was “curious,” “crusty” or “crooked,” and so forth; but still Jack Spratte was heartwhole—sound as a roach, and as gracefully playful as an eel. Jack Spratte, in that blind confidence for which some men are remarkable, thought that the hook had not yet been baited which was destined to discompose the serenity of his gills, and that he was no catfish in a pool, devoted to an early fry. He little dreamed that celibacy is very “unsartin,” and that the cork lines and the lay-out lines, together with the dipsies, to say nothing of the gilling seines, the floats and the scoop-nets, are always about, and that the most innocent nibble may result in a captivation. Jack Spratte was strong in spirit when he stepped forth from the festive hall, and crooked his dexter arm for the accommodation of Miss Felicia Phinney. He was jocose in his criticisms and observations for a square or two, and he reviewed the sports of the evening with a degree of humour which entitled him to rank with the wits of the time. But the night was one not to be resisted, even by Jack Spratte. He soon found that his chest—the chest enclosing his susceptibilities—was not a safety chest, not a fireproof asbestos chest, such as they roast under cords of blazing hickory, and submit without damage to vast conflagrations—but, on the contrary, though he never suspected it before, rather a weak chest—he had an oppression at the chest—in short, an affection of the chest, resulting in a palpitation of the heart—and his tongue became hard and dry, while there was a peculiar whizzing in his ears, as if the “Ice-breaker” were suddenly letting off steam. He stammered and he trembled. “It can't be the punch,” observed Jack Spratte, internally to himself; “it can't be the punch that makes me such a Judy. I didn't take enough of it for that— no, nor do I believe it is the fried oysters; for I put plenty of Cayenne pepper and mustard on 'em.” No, Jack Spratte; it was neither the punch nor the oysters. They are wronged by the suspicion. It was the moonlight, chiefly, and Miss Felicia Phinney in the second place. Amid the oysters, the punch and the blazing lamps—amid the joke, the laugh and the song— yea, even in the romp and in the redemption of pawns, Jack Spratte was safe. But a walk into the air proved fatal to him. The contrast was too much for his constitution, like an icy draught on an August day. Mirth often reacts into sensibility, and the liveliest strain easily modulates into tenderness; just as extreme jocundity in a child is but the prelude to a flood of tears. Jack Spratte acted without premeditation, and instinctively thought it wiser to begin afar off, and to approach the subject by circumvallation. His first parallel was laid as follows: “Miss Phinney,” said he, and his voice faltered as he spoke, “Miss Phinney, don't you think that pearches is good, but that rockfishes is nicer—better nor sunnies?” “Why, every goose knows that,” replied the lady, forgetting, in her dislike to the professional allusion of Spratte's remark, that geese are not particularly addicted to fish—“but what are you talking about sich things now for? We're not setting on the end of the wharf, I'd like to know—are we?” “No, we're not,” hastily ejaculated Jack Spratte, who felt that the crisis of his fate was at hand; “but oh, Miss Phinney!—oh, Miss Felicia Phinney!—don't trifle with my dearest affekshins—don't keep me a danglin' and a kickin', with a big hook right through the gristle of my nose!” The figurative style in which passion is apt to indulge, was strikingly manifest in Mr. Spratte's mode of expression; but it may well be doubted whether it operated in a way likely to promote his cause. “Well, if ever I heerd of sich a tarnal fool!” was Miss Phinney's unkind response; “Jack Spratte, I've not got hold of your nose yet, whatever I may do if you keep a cuttin' up in this crazy sort of way; and as for your affekshins, take care there isn't kicks about your other shins, which might hurt worse. Why—what—do—you —mean—anyhow?” continued she, with great emphasis and deliberation. “I mean,” gasped Jack Spratte, so overcome by the contending emotions of love and fear, that he was constrained to catch hold of a lamp-post with his disengaged hand, to prevent himself from falling; “what I mean is this—you've got a nibble—yes, you've got a bite!—haul me up quick, thou loveliest of sitters in the Jarsey market—haul me up quick, and stow me away in your basket. I'm hook'd and I am cotch'd—I'm your `catty' forvermore. String me on a willow switch, and lug me right away home!” And Jack Spratte came near fainting upon the spot. His heart was laid open—a feat of amatory surgery which almost proved fatal to the daring lover. Miss Felicia Phinney stepped back and gazed at him in undisguised amazement. “You, Jack!” said she, “you'd better jine the teeto-tallers to-morrow, when you've got the headache. You must be snapt now—any man that acts so queer, must be blue.” “No, no, no!—I thought it was the punch myself, at first—but it's not—it's love—nothing but love—love, without no water, no sugar, nor no nutmeg. They couldn't make punch so strong—not even with racky-fortus, stirred up with lignum-witey! Take pity on me, do! Mayn't I hope, Phinney, mayn't I hope? If you hav'n't time to love me now, I can wait till you're ready— yes, wait a hopin'.” “You're much more likely to be sent a hoppin', Mr. Jack Spratte.” “I only want to be on an understandin' now—sort of engaged, and sort of not engaged—just to know who I belong to.” “Well, once for all, you wont belong to me, Jack Spratte, no how it could be fixed,” and Miss Felicia Phinney began to look enchantingly savage. “Ah, now, don't—the cork's under—pull me up— ah, do!” Jack Spratte sank upon his knees, with mouth open and upturned, as if he expected to be taken in hand immediately, and to have the hook gently and scientifically extracted, after the fashion of the experienced angler; but he was doomed to disappointment; and, to continue the metaphor, he may be regarded as a trout that broke the snood, and was left among the bulrushes, to pine away, with the barb deep in its gullet—an image, to express this peculiar state of things, which is quite as poetical, true and striking as if allusion were had to the “stricken deer,” or to the “arrow-wounded dove.” Birds and quadrupeds have had a monopoly in this matter quite too long, and original sentiment must now prepare to dive among the fishes, for the sake of novel illustration. “Jack Spratte,” said the “scornful ladye,” “quit lookin' like a sturgeon with the mumps—I've done with you—get up and tortle home the straightest way there is, and think yourself confounded lucky that you didn't get spanked this very night. Marry you, indeed!—why, I wouldn't marry a decent man, or a good-lookin' man, or a man with some sort of sense in his head; and nobody would ever tell so big a whacker as to say you are sich a one. Now, do you hooey home, and don't try to follow 13* me, if you happen to know when a fool is well off;” and the “scornful ladye” walked disdainfully away, with an air like Juno in her tantrums. Jack Spratte remained upon his knees, as if converted into a perfect petrifaction. His eyelids never twinkled— he seemed not even to breathe—to all intents and purposes, he was, for the time being, a defunct Spratte, and it is presumed that, to this day, he would still have been found upon the same spot, like a spratte done in salt, if the watchman had not threatened to arrest him for being non com. “Where is she?” exclaimed he wildly, as he started to his feet. “Where is what?” said the nocturnal perambulator. “Mrs. Spratte!” cried Jack, with a bewildered air, “Mrs. Jack Spratte, that is to be. I'm goin' to be married, aint I?” “I don't know whether you're going to be married or not,” was the petulant reply; “but, if you don't go away, you'll be like to spend the rest of the evening with the capun, at the watch'us. It's not my business to tell people when they're goin' to be married, whether they're sprattes or gudgeons.” “Yes, that's it—I am—I am a gudgeon!” said Spratte, smiting his forehead and then darting away. “A werry flat sort of a fish, that chap is,” said Charley, with a sage expression. Jack Spratte went directly home, just as he had been bid—he went home, not with any definite purpose in view—he did not want to sleep, he did not want to eat, he did not want to sit down—he merely experienced an undefined “want to go home,” peculiar to the Anglo-Saxon race, when they do not exactly know what to do with themselves, (all other people go out, under similar circumstances,) and, therefore, home he went, very much after the fashion of a livery-stable horse, when the gig has been demolished, or the rider left in some friendly ditch. He came home like a whirlwind; but yet his feelings were those which may be supposed to belong to the minor vegetables—the most diminutive of the potato tribe. He had not been “strung upon a willow switch”—he, Jack Spratte, was enrolled among the “great rejected”— a goodly company enough; but he derived no consolation from the thought. Jack Spratte vowed vengeance!—Jack Spratte kept his word!! Many other lovers shared the fate which had befallen the unhappy Spratte; and, to the general eye, it certainly did appear as if Felicia Phinney was to realize her boast, that “if other gals had to take up with husbands, she, at least, could do without a master,” though it was perhaps clear enough that, in any event, the master was likely to be but a “negative quantity.” Miss Felicia Phinney waxed onward in years, and, as her years increased, her energy and her commanding spirit seemed to gather new strength. She became omnipotent in the market-house, and wo to those who dared to undersell, or tried too perseveringly to cheapen her commodities. “Why now, aunty, is that the lowest?” was sometimes, and not unfrequently, the question. “Sattingly—what d'ye 'spect?—Fishes is fishes now, and shad is skurse,” would be the tart reply, and the saleswoman would slap a pair of shad together, until they resounded through the arches of the market like the report of a swivel—“skurse enough, and the profits being small, them as prices, ought to buy—that's the principle I go upon,” and the fishes would again be brought in contact, to the great discomposure of all who happened to be within hearing. In appeals of this sort, the maiden fish-woman seldom failed to be successful—especially when the customer happened to be rather unpractised in the affairs of the market—for there was something peculiarly imposing in her tone and attitude, as she held a fish by the gills in each hand. Mark Antony himself was not more persuasive over the remains of the slain Cæsar, than was Miss Felicia Phinney when haranguing over her “skurse shad.” “Ha! ha! it's well she bought something,” would be the after remark, “for if there's any thing I hate to do, it is being obligated and necessiated to flop a customer over the head with a shad—'specially if it's a lady, with a bran-new, tearin' fine bonnet—a hard flop with a shad is sudden death and run for the coroner, on spring fashions. But when people prices, they've got to buy. I go for principles, and if they wont buy, why, flopped they ought to be, and flopped they must be, or our rights will soon be done for. People are gettin' so sassy now, that by'm'by, if they're not learnt manners, they'll take our shad for nothin', and make us carry 'em home to boot. There certainly appears to be a retributive principle in nature, which, sooner or later, victimizes us as we have victimized others—a species of moral lex talionis, which returns the ingredients of our chalice to our own lips. No man ever made a greater “bull” than he who manufactured a brazen representative of the animal, that Phalaris might roast his victims in it, and hear their bellowing cries—for the ingenious artificer was himself the earliest victim, and roared like a calf. The original hangman does not live in story. It is but fair, however, to infer that he died by the rope, and either strangled himself, or had that friendly office performed for him by another. All who introduced refinements in the application of the axe—that most aristocratic of executive instruments—have themselves been subjected to a different process of “shortening” from any set down in Miss Leslie's “Domestic Cookery;” and probably the inventor of solitary confinement and the “Pennsylvania system of prison discipline,” was she of the “mistleto bough”—the identical lady of the “old oak chest.” The retributive principle goes even further than this. There are retributive husbands and retributive wives—such, at least, do they seem to be—whose office appears to consist in being a penance for previous jiltings, previous flirtations, and antecedent insults of all kinds, to the blind little gentleman who primitively sports with bow and arrow, disdaining recourse to the use of fire-arms. In this sense, Mr. Brownstout was a retribution—a retribution for all the past offences of Miss Felicia Phinney. He had been ambushed far onward in her course through time; so that when she thought the past forgotten, and when she had measurably forgotten the past, the retributive husband might, like a steel trap, be sprung upon her. Whether Brownstout—Mr. Brownstout—had been created and trained for this especial purpose, does not appear. He was but a little fellow, it is true—in this respect, his person and his name were in evident contradiction to each other; but he was an ample sufficiency to bring about the purposes for which he was intended. There is, they say, such a thing as love at first sight— an instantaneous attack, resembling somewhat the unexpected assault of cholera, in Calcutta or thereabouts, where the victim, doubled up, at once falls to the ground. This spontaneous combustion is not perhaps so frequent in modern days, as when the world was younger. Time and change, atmospherical or otherwise, modify all disorders, and by these influences, love, like the lightning, has, to a considerable extent, fallen under the control of science, and has ceased to be so rash, sudden, and explosive as it was; while the actual cases do not exhibit symptoms so imminent and dangerous. Young gentlemen now-a-days are not nearly so apt, according to the popular phrase, to be “struck all of a heap,” as their grandfathers and their paternal predecessors are represented to have been. The Fire-King thought little of remaining in the oven until the dinner was baked—a feat at which precedent ages would have looked aghast—but experiment has since proved that the generality of our kind are salamanders to the same extent, and a similar truth appears to have been demonstrated, as to the capacity existing in the present era, to withstand the fire of the brightest eyes that ever beamed from a side-box at the opera. Who ever hears that Orlando has shot himself for love with a percussion pistol, or with one of your six barrelled, repeating detonators? No—that fashion expired before the flint lock was superseded, and when the steam engine came roaring along, the lover ceased to sigh,—instead of suffering himself to be pale and disheveled, he looks in the mirror and brushes his whiskers; and, as hearts are not knocked about so violently as they were at the period of small swords and chapeaus, it follows as a natural consequence, that they are very rarely broken past repair. Miss Felicia Phinney, it may be, from having so long evaded the “soft impeachment,” was finally afflicted somewhat after the fashion of our ancestors. Her constitution, not being accustomed—perhaps we should say seasoned—to such shocks, “took it hard.” An individual of her “timber” could not be expected to “pine;” but when Mr. Brownstout first insinuatingly and delicately asked the price of a shad—in those very tones which cause lovers' words to sound “so silver sweet by night” —she felt that her hour had come—and that her “unhoused free condition must be put in circumscription and confine.” Whether she was affected by the force of contrast, in joining which, as Mr. Sheridan Knowles has taken occasion to remark, “lieth love's delight,” or whether Mr. Brownstout only chanced to present himself at the propitious moment, is a problem which the parties themselves, unaccustomed as they are to such analysis, could not undertake to solve. It is true that Felicia Phinney was somewhat tall and not a little muscular, and that Mr. Brownstout had no pretensions either to length, or to any unusual degree of latitude in form. She was bold, determined, and rather Stentorian in her vocalities —he was mild, submissive and plausible, when it was necessary—being both serpentine and dovelike. Brownstout saw that he had made an impression.— Every one intuitively knows when he has been thus fortunate; and he justly thought that if he had been so successful when only asking the price of a fish, results must ensue proportionably greater, if he were actually to become the purchaser of the article; for, if a mere tap at the door is productive of notable consequences, a regular peal with the knocker cannot fail to rouse the entire household. Now Brownstout, who at that period was “a tailor by trade,” but one who had a soul so much above buttons that he could but rarely be persuaded to sew any of them on, had a tolerably clear perception of the fact, that it would be rather a comfortable thing—a nice thing, indeed—to hang up his hat in a house of his own, and to possess a wife gifted with the faculty of making money— a sublunary arrangement of surpassing loveliness, provided the wife be duly impressed with a sense of its symmetrical proportions, and has the good taste not to recur to the subject too often. On the one hand, he saw—“in his mind's eye, Horatio”—enchanting visions of ninepins, shuffleboard and other exercises of that sort, made still more agreeable by proper allowances of ale and tobacco—while, on the other hand, a sufficient basis—“a specie basis”— for all these absorbing delights was evident in a stand at the mart piscatorial, femininely attended. There was a beautiful harmony in this aspect of the case, that came straight home to his bosom. It combined dignity with utility—poetry with practice—the sweet with the useful, in such architectural grace, that it was not in his nature to abandon the prospect. He had what few men have— a scheme of life before him, which dove-tailed into all his peculiarities of disposition, and might be pronounced perfect. It is not then to be wondered at that Thais at Alexander's side, on the memorable evening when the mail brought the election returns from Persia, was not more soul-subduing than Miss Felicia Phinney seemed in the eyes of the enraptured Brownstout. It was not in his way, to be sure. He was not altogether accustomed to such matters; but as he was aware of the truth of the axiom, “nothing venture, nothing have,” he ultimately made the desperate resolve to buy a fish, and—reckless man!—to pay for it!—to buy, if necessary to the completion of his great design, several successive fishes and to pay for them, and he saw but one difficulty in the way. His road was clear enough so far as the mere purchase was involved; but it was the second clause in the programme of the operation which somewhat puzzled Mr. Brownstout, as indeed it often puzzles financiers of a more elevated range. He might buy, but, like Macbeth, he did not know how to “trammel up the consequence,” which was to pay. It is true that a certain practical philosopher has decided that “base is the slave who pays;” yet there are times when circumstances so combine against the principles of “free trade” that to pay is unavoidable. Mr. Brownstout felt his situation to be a case in point, and he was sadly puzzled as to the mode in which this monetary obstacle was to be surmounted, until he remembered that, in default of assets, there is a mode of hypothecating one's hopes and prospects so that they may be “coined to drachmas.” He resolved to borrow on his personal liability, secured by the “collateral” of his chances in matrimony, of course promising a premium proportionate to the risk. For the means of obtaining a half dollar's worth of fish, he was, at a future day, to return a full dollar, which is not unreasonable, considering the shadowy nature of prospective dollars, dependent on contingencies—dollars, so situated, are very uncertain dollars—dollars, which are “to be or not to be,” as the fates may determine. When any one says “I'll owe you a dollar,” it often requires acute ears to detect even the approaching jingle thereof. “A sweet morning, Miss Phinney!—a lovely morning —quite circumambient and mellifluous, if I may use the expression. Such mornings as this cause us bachelors to feel like posts in a flower garden—we may look on, to be sure, but no rosies and posies are blooming for us—we are nothing but interlopers and don't belong to the family —solitary and forlorn in the middle of the crowd. More juvenile people, such as you, Miss Phinney, don't realize those things; but for me!”—and Brownstout assumed an expression peculiarly plaintive, as he stood in the market-house vis-à-vis to the shad basket. “I minds my own business, Mr. Brownstout, and never trades in rosies and posies,” was the gentle reply; “the beautifulest mornings, to my thinking, is them when people bites sharp and are hungry for fish. Hyperflutenations and dictionary things are not in my way;” but Miss Phinney was evidently pleased with Brownstout's “hyper-flutenations and dictionary things,” and liked them none the worse probably because they were not very clearly understood. “You are right, madam—perfectly right. When people have a taste for fish, they are generally fond of fish, 14 and are likely to show their good sense by buying fish. I'm very much attached to fish myself. How are fish to-day?” “Why, pretty well, I thank you, Mr. Brownstout; how do you find yourself?” This being the first attempt at a joke ever essayed by Miss Felicia Phinney, she was quite pleased with the darling, and she laughed—rather rustily, it must be confessed, but she did laugh; and Brownstout, not being deficient in tact, he laughed too. If you desire to win people's hearts, always laugh at their jokes, whether good, bad, or indifferent—more heartily, in fact, at those which are bad and indifferent than at the good ones. It proves your benevolence. The good joke can take care of itself and walk alone, while the others are rickety and require cherishing, and are also, on this account, the greater favourites with the author of their being. Brownstout laughed—“ha—ha—hugh!” and Miss Phinney laughed—“he—he—haw!” Pretty well on both sides. This intermingling of laughs often leads to an intermingling of sighs, if care be taken not to laugh too much; for a lover habitually jocose seldom prospers with the fair, however deep the undertow of his sentimentality. Brownstout was aware of this, and subsided betimes into a more amiable 'haviour of the visage. He finally bought his fish, and, as they dangled from his hand, so did he dangle after Miss Phinney, and the combined perseverance of dangling and purchasing at last brought him to the haven of his hopes. They were married, and Miss Felicia Phinney was duly metamorphosed into Mrs. Brownstout. But who had urged this ill-starred attachment to so dire a catastrophe!—who but Jack Spratte—the Varney Spratte —the Iago Spratte—the worse than Schedoni Spratte!— Spratte, the rejected—Spratte, the despised!! He had never forgotten, though long years had elapsed, the outrage to his tender emotions on that memorable night of “Copenhagen and fried oysters”—of love and despair— when the expression of his lacerated feelings had been imputed to the effects of punch—when, in spite of assurances that “the hook was through the gristle of his nose,” the obdurate fair had refused to “pull him up.” Had Jack Spratte been oblivious of his wrongs? No—they had lain within his bosom as icy as a cold potato, while the sweet cider of his affections had passed through all the grades of fermentation—acetous and so forth—until they had become vinegar, sharper than the north wind— pepper vinegar, to which “picalillies” are not a circumstance. The merry Spratte, in a single night, had been converted into a pike of the fiercest description. He frequented the shuffleboard—he early discovered the secret of Mr. Brownstout's attachment—he treated to slings and egg nog, until he ascertained the relative position of parties, and all necessary particulars—he confirmed Brownstout's wavering resolution—he lent him the money to buy shad—and he, even he, stood groomsman at the ceremony, covering his procrastinated triumph in deceptive smiles, and eating cake as if his heart were filled with sympathetic emotions. Why did Jack Spratte do this?—why?—because he knew Mr. Brownstout's sordid views—his nefarious designs—his intention to frequent the ninepin alley and the shuffleboard, while his wife sold fish in the market—his resolution never to work again. It was Jack Spratte's Revenge!! Diabolical Spratte!!! The results which Jack Spratte had anticipated, as some compensation for his sufferings, were not of slow development. “Domestic uneasiness” gathered like a cloud around the hearth-stone of the Brownstouts; for Brownstout, being busily engaged in the pursuit of happiness, was not only absent the greater part of the day, but rarely made his appearance at all until one or two o'clock in the morning; and, when he did come, his first visitation was to his wife's professional check apron, to obtain an additional supply of the sinews of war. “Husbands are luxuries, my dear, and must be paid for accordingly,” was his only reply to words of remonstrance; and when the aforesaid pocket was put out of sight, he broke things by way of demonstration, until it was again brought within reach. Mrs. Brownstout, in the warmth of her affection, for a time tried kindness as a means of reform—she winked at her husband's idleness and made him a weekly allowance; but his ideas on the subject of gentlemanly expenditure, developed themselves too rapidly to be confined within the bounds of such limits, and he had secret recourse to the pocket, until the deficiencies thus occasioned became too palpable to be concealed. The cash would not balance, and, naturally enough, the patience of Mrs. Brownstout then kicked the beam. She “flopped” her little husband—not with a shad, as might be expected, but with a shovel applied in its latitude, “broadside on.” The next morning, silence reigned through the hapless domicile of the Brownstouts. The masculine owner of that name had disappeared, and with him the pocket, check apron and all. Night after night he came not, and Mrs. Brownstout grew meagre and dejected. “I'm a lone widder feller,” sighed she, “or just as bad. When you aint got your husband, it's pretty near the same thing as if you hadn't none. But men is men all the world over, and you can't help it no how. When Brownstout fust came a courtin' to me, you'd a thought butter wouldn't a melted in his mouth, he pretended to be so sniptious. He swore he loved me; but now, just because of a little difficulty about the shovel, he's shinned it like a white-head, with my pocket full of change and all the spoons he could lay his hands on.” And so Mrs. Brownstout one evening sallied forth in search of the delinquent. The bar was in full practice—clients and “cases” flocked around it in abundance. Four “hands,” with their sleeves rolled up, could scarcely, with all their quickness, mix the “fancy drinks” fast enough to supply the demand, so numerous were the applications for refreshment. Corks were popping—the bottles gurgled—clouds of cigar smoke were “rolling dun,” and men had to speak at the very stretch of their voices, to be heard over the thunder of the balls, as they went trolling along the board and crashing among the ninepins, anon booming back adown the trough. There, amidst the crowd, divested of his coat and waistcoat, to give free play to muscular action, was Brownstout!—the faithless Brownstout!—in his glory. His cigar and his half-empty tumbler stood upon an adjacent ledge—in the enthusiasm of the hour, he had not only bared his arms, but likewise girt his body with a bandana, and tucked his trowsers into his boots. There was a streak of chalk upon his face, which gave its general flush of excitement a still more ruddy tinge. It was his throw! Nicely did Brownstout poise the ponderous ball, which rested on his right hand, while the forefinger of the left remained for an instant upon its upper hemisphere. He paused a moment for an inspiring sip and a preliminary puff—and then—the living statues never displayed more grace in attitude—every head projected, as if their owners would penetrate into futurity, and see results before they were accomplished. Brownstout bowed himself to the task, scanning the interval with that eye of skill which so surely betokens victory, and then, with a slide like 14* that of the feathered Mercury—whizz!—bang!—slam!— boom!—bump!—smash!!—crash!!! “Another set-up!” is the general cry, and Brownstout, with a back-handed sweep across his countenance, which scarcely concealed the half-suppressed smile of conscious genius beaming in every feature—though he would have looked indifferent, had that been possible—turned himself once more to his tumbler and to his cigar, like one who felt that “he had done the state some service and they knew it.” He had reason to be proud. Not only had he achieved victory for his “pard'ners” and gained the refreshment tickets—good for a drink and trimmings— consequent thereon—but he had also secured several bets, couched under the mysterious phrase of being for “something all round.” Indeed, it is not certain that an “oyster supper for six” was not also dependent on the result, which Brownstout had mentally resolved should be an oyster supper for one, on each of six specified nights, and not an oyster supper for six, on one night; the last being a common arrangement, but regarded by him as at war with true economy, and as most “wasteful and ridiculous excess.” After the first burst of exultation was over, the victors seemed suddenly to become athirst—they smacked their lips, and made many other conventional signs expressive of that condition, jogging the elbows of the defeated, and asking, very significantly, “what shall it be?”—a sound which awakened the smiles of “the bar,” the members whereof began scientifically to handle the decanters chiefly affected by Mr. Brownstout's “brave associates— partners of his toil”—for had he not gained the decisive “set-up?” “Set-up!”—unlucky words! Well said Napoleon to the Abbe De Pradt, that from the sublime to the ridiculous there is but one step. It was so with the emperor. He and Brownstout both found that often when we have gained a “set-up,” we are nearest to a “set-down.” “Out of the way!” shrieked a well-known voice, the owner of which was endeavouring to force a passage through the crowd—“I'm sure he's here—he's always here, and I'm come to fetch him!” “The old woman!” exclaimed Brownstout, in trembling dismay, as the tumbler slipped from his nerveless hand, and the cigar rolled into the folds of his bosom. “And old woman!” repeated the gentlemen of the bar, letting fall their “muddlers.” “His old woman!” re-echoed the ninepin players, aghast. “Brownstout's old woman!” was the general chorus. “Run, Brown!” “Hop, Stout!!” “Make yourself scarce!” Too late, alas! were these kindly hints from those who would have saved their beloved friend from the infliction of domestic discipline. Brownstout saw that retreat was impossible. His wife's broad hand was upon him. He fell back breathless with terror—it is presumed that reminiscences of the shovel danced athwart his brain. Like another Mephistophiles, Jack Spratte appeared upon the scene. The author of mischief is always in at the catastrophe. “You are a precious set of warmint!” said Mrs. Brownstout, as she glared fiercely around—“who am I to thank for deludin' my old man to sich places as this, to waste his time and my money on fools and foolery?” “Thank me!” exclaimed Jack Spratte, hysterically, “me!—me! to whom you guv' the mitten!—me, who got the bag to hold!—me, whose nose was put out of jint!—me, whose young hopes was drownded in cold water almost before their eyes was opened!” The “adsum qui feci” of the Latin poet was never more finely “done into English,” though it may well be questioned whether the atrocious Spratte had ever heard of Nisus and Euryalus. The excitement became intense—the crowd huddled around—the boys rushed from the pins to listen to the denouement—and one thirsty soul at the bar showed his interest in the matter, by hastily swallowing the contents of three other gentlemen's glasses, to fortify himself for the occasion, after which he also hurried to the centre. “It was me that done it all!” continued Spratte, gesticulating spasmodically—“I know'd he'd break your heart!—I know'd he'd hook your money!—I know'd he'd keep always goin' out and never comin' home agin! If it hadn't been for me, he'd not have married you—but now I'm revenged—now I'm happy—now I'm—ha! ha! hugh!” and Jack Spratte sprung high into the air, and, on his return to earth, spun round three times, and, exhausted by emotion, fell prostrate, upsetting a table upon which stood three “brandies” and one whisky punch. Mrs. Brownstout dropped her hands, and suffered the almost inanimate form of her husband to go lumbering to the earth, while she stood petrified with despair at this terrible revelation. Her heart was congealed, and every bystander was stricken with horror at Spratte's having been been such a “debaushed fish”—all were moved inwardly, except the utilitarian who had imbibed the other gentlemen's liquor, and he seized on the chance to move outwardly, that he might sneak away without discharging the dues for that which he had ordered himself. There were no more ninepins that night—the moral influence was such that the boys put out the lights without being told to do so—if they had not, indeed, it is probable the lights would have gone out of themselves. Mr. and Mrs. Brownstout went home in a cab—they were too much overcome to walk. Jack Spratte recovered by slow degrees—the three brandies and the whisky punch, in which he was immersed, probably saved his life—but Jack Spratte never smiled again, no matter how good the joke. His bosom was seared—his heart was like a dried cherry several seasons old, and so he became a drummer in the marines, delighting only in the beating of tattoo and reveille, as two of the most misanthropic of employments—the one sending men to bed, while the other forces them to get up. He was severe upon these points of war, and it was noticed that he was always a little before the time in the performance of each. Such are the spiteful effects of blighted affections, which give acerbity even to a musician! But Jack Spratte's revenge had failed—most signally failed. After the events of the ninepin alley, Brownstout was an altered man. He might justly be spoken of as a great moral re-action. Stung to the quick at having been made an instrument of revenge—a mere drumstick of malignity—he burnt all the tickets in his possession, “good,” as they were, “for refreshments at the bar”—he returned the check apron pocket to his wife, though probably it would have been more acceptable if any thing had remained in it. The spoons, however, were past redemption; but what are spoons in comparison with matrimonial comfort—what are spoons, when one's husband works in the daytime and never goes out in the evenings? Mrs. Brownstout was a happy woman, and never, in fact, hinted at “spoons,” unless she had cause to suspect that her husband's thoughts might perhaps be straying towards ninepins. That word always brought him straight, and she but rarely had occasion to say “spoons,” except on the Fourth of July or about the Christmas holidays. As for the bibulous individual before alluded to, the poetic catastrophe to which he was an accidental witness, made him so dry that he has been busy ever since in a vain endeavour to quench his thirst. He thinks of hiring himself out as a dam to any moderate sized river, and would do so, if the navigation company were liberal enough to put a drop of something in the water, just to take the chill off and to correct its crudities. And such is the end of “Jack Spratte's Revenge.”</field>

There are men—many men—whose mental callipers grasp only a single idea—the sun of whose thought revolves about, warms and enlightens but one little world, that world being the contracted universe (for universe it is to them) of their own personal affairs and individual interests. From some congenital defect in their intellectual optics—as spectacles for the mind remain to be invented, and as the concave lens has not yet been adjusted to rectify the imperfect vision of the soul—they live within a narrow horizon, and browse, as it were, with a tether, having a certain circumference of grass, without the ability to take a mouthful beyond its limits. Nor, indeed, have they any desire for such epicurean adventure. They do not so much as wish to glance into any field which is not peculiarly their own. The clover which belongs to them, satisfies all their wants, and to disturb themselves at all, as to how other people make hay, is a stretch of ambition to which they never aspire. Armies may devour each other—navies may go down and submit their Paixhans artillery to the investigation of the grampus and other martial fishes,—empires may rock and reel, like Fourth of July revellers, in the days when the evidence of patriotism was to make the head heavier than the heels; but the species to which we refer, still open their shops with unshaken nerves, take their breakfast with undiminished appetite, and go about their business with no thought but that of making both ends meet. To bear a hand in the grand work of ameliorating the condition of the human race, is a matter, in their opinion, which qualifies one for the first vacancy in the lunatic asylum. They belong to no philanthropic associations to regulate the price of soap in another hemisphere; nor have they ever entered into an organization to compel the employing shoemakers of the moon to give their apprentices half-holiday once a week. They are sure that “Convention” must be something relative to Bedlam, and that those who wish to reform everybody else, must stand greatly in need of some such operation themselves. An election, to them, is an annual nuisance—a periodical eruption, made necessary by a defective constitution, and all the meetings which go before, are, in their eyes, merely the premonitory symptom that disease is reaching a crisis. Processions and parades move their pity, and when they think at all about the turmoil of the outer world, it is only to wonder when the fools will have it “fixed” to their liking. Far different from these is that disinterested body of men and boys who lounge at the corners of the way in a great metropolis; members of the human family who may be said to be always on hand and continually in circulation. They literally are the pillars of the state. They prop up lamp-posts—patronise fire-plugs, and encourage the lindens of the street in their unpractised efforts to grow. The luxuriant trees, which adorn the front of Independence Hall, outstrip all others in umbrageous beauty, because they, beyond all others, have been sustained by the kindness of loungers; and they now strive to return the compliment, by affording a canopy to intercept the rays of the sun, and to avert the falling shower, from the beloved friends who stand by them, have stood by them, and will continue to stand by them, in every sort of weather. In ancient Rome, whenever that respectable republic got itself into a difficulty with those unreasonable people who were foolish enough to wish to regulate their own affairs, and when the storm grew loud and threatening, it was sometimes found necessary to intrust all things to the discretion of a dictator, whose duty it was “to take care that the republic received no detriment.” But, without the provisions of law—without the troubles and dangers which flowed from the Roman practice, we are happy in the possession of a host of such officers, unrecognised, it is true, but not the less efficient, whose chief employment and whose main delight it is, reckless of honour and emolument, to take care that nothing detrimental happens to the republic. Their regards are always upon it, in jealous supervision. They are no speculative overseers, who imperfectly attend to exterior affairs, by lounging in slippered ease in luxurious offices, disporting themselves over the newspapers of the day. They are not influenced by the mere report of scouts, or the sinister assertions of the interested; but make it their daily practice to hear with their own ears and to see with their own eyes. Nay, they push their zealous watchfulness so far, that they may often be seen in the exercise of their high functions, when other mortals, less gifted with discrimination, can discover nothing to excite their notice. When the pavier is at work in the highway, heaving the weighty rammer with most emphatic groan, not a pebble is driven to its place, that the genuine lounger has not marked in every stage of its progress. No gas-pipe is adjusted, without undergoing a similar scrutiny, and the sanctified spot where the pig was killed or the hound was run over, acquires such mysterious and fascinating importance in the lounger's estimation, that he will stand whole days in sombre contemplation of so distinguished a locality. Even the base of Pompey's statue, where great Cæsar fell, could not prove more attractive; and Rizzio's blood, which stains the floor of Holyrood, is not more dear to the antiquary than are the marks left by an overturned wagon, to the non-commissioned superintendents of the city. Indeed, they have been seen 15 congregated for hours around the house from which the tenants moved on the previous night, without complying with the vexatious ceremony of paying the rent—a feudal exaction perpetuated by landlords for the perplexity of the people. Should a masterless hat be found, or a drop of blood be discovered in the street, it forms a nucleus for a gathering. No matter how slight the cause may seem to the ordinary intellect, there are persons who look more deeply into things, and derive wisdom from circumstances apparently too trivial to deserve regard. But they are secret, too. The perfect lounger, though prodigal of his presence, is a niggard with his words. It is his vocation to see, and not to speak. His inferences are locked within the recesses of his own breast. He is wary and diplomatic, and not like other individuals, to be sounded “from the lowest note to the top of his compass,” by the curiosity of each passing stranger. He opposes no one in the acquisition of knowledge—he places no stumbling-blocks in the way; but, by his taciturnity, intimates that the results of his labours are not to be obtained for nothing. It is his motto that if you desire information, you must use the proper means to acquire it; for you have the same natural qualifications for the purpose as he. That this characteristic belongs to the street lounger— we have nothing to say about the inferior class who operate solely within walls—is evident from the fact that it rarely happens in the course of the most inquisitive life, that any one, on approaching a crowd, can ascertain, by inquiry of its component members, why it has assembled. The question is either unheeded altogether, or else a supercilious glance is turned upon the querist, with a laconic response that the party does not know. Ostensibly, nobody knows a jot about the matter, except the fortunate few who form the inner circle, and, as it were, hem in all knowledge. They who extricate themselves early from the interior pressure, and walk away, either with smiling faces, as if the joke were good, or with a solemn sadness of the brow, as if their sensibilities had been lacerated, even they “don't know!” None will tell, except perchance it be a luckless urchin not yet taught to economize his facts, or some unsophisticated girl with a market basket, who talks for talking's sake. But who believes that the initiated “don't know”—that the omnipresent lounger “don't know?” It is not to be believed. He does know; but from some as yet undetermined and unappreciated singularity of his nature, it is rather his pleasure to be looked upon as ignorant, than to “unlace his reputation” by proving false to so cardinal a point in the practice of his kind, as to be a mere bulletin for others' uses. What he knows, he knows—let that content you. He has employment for all he has acquired, which, to outward appearance, would be spoiled by participation; but where, or how, or when he proposes to use it, is a problem which remains to be solved. Unawed by the state of the weather, these watchful sentinels are always abroad; and so far are they elevated above the influences of prevailing effeminacy, that they indulge so little in home delights as to induce many to believe that they dispense altogether with the enervating comforts of a fixed domicile. When their nature must needs “recuperate,” it is supposed they “rotate” for repose, and that thus, by never couching themselves consecutively in the same nest, they catch abuses napping, by their sudden and unexpected appearance “so early in the morning.” But, whatever may be the private habits, entomologically or ornithologically speaking, of “the corner lounger,” he is a self-evident proposition and an undeniable fact There may be doubts as to the existence of other things—all circumstantial nature may be disputed; but he must be confessed. Go where you will, he is there, and as he is there to everybody, his there must be everywhere, paradoxical as it may seem. His visibility is co-existent with your presence, and it would require the pen of transcendentalism to explain the mysterious nature of his wonderful ubiquity. We have not language to pourtray the phenomena developed in this respect by a civic lounger of the superlative class; but, in homely phrase, if we may so express it, like a speck upon the eye itself, look where you will, he stands full blown before you. He is rarely seen in motion—never in transitu; but he is at your elbow when you depart, and when you have reached your end, the lounger is at the place in anticipation, leisurely drumming with his heels upon a post and bearing no traces of a forced march. By what magic process this is accomplished, no one can tell. There is no proof that he travels. There is no physical sign in his appearance, to induce a belief that he excels in locomotion, or has any taste for such active employment as would seem to be necessary for achieving such results; and so much are the scientific puzzled to account for the fact to which we have reference, that a paper is said to be in preparation for the “Philosophical Transactions,” having for its object to determine “whether a corner lounger, in his distinctive and individual capacity, be one or many; or whether the specimen be not multitudinous, in an identical shape and image, so that in the same form and as one person, he is gifted with the capacity to be everywhere at once.” Every nice observer will be inclined to receive the last hypothesis as the correct impression; for he must often have had abundant reason to conclude that the lounger is really thus, “as broad and general as the casing air”—a Monsieur Tonson who has always “come again.” There are, however, certain peculiarities in this matter which are also worthy of remark—little niceties in the case which deserve their comment. As each man is supposed to have his superintending star—his supervising genius, which, both in weal and wo, hovers about his footsteps or directs his course, so each individual has his lounging “John Jones”—his familiar from the spirit-land of loaferdom. We know him not, but in his palpable form—we have exchanged no word or kindness with him—he has no interest in our affairs, nor we in his— there is no earthly tie existing; but when we have once marked our coincident lounger, he is there for ever—our inevitable fate—the everlasting frontispiece in the volume of our experiences—our perpetual double, in sunshine or in rain. Let the fact once be presented to your sensorium that you rarely go to any place without seeing “that man,” and your doom is sealed. You never will go anywhere without seeing him, either there or on your way there, from that time forth; and when you do not see him, be assured that there is abundant reason to doubt whether you are really yourself, and whether, notwithstanding appearances, you are not mistaken in the person—so that in shaving your apparent countenance, you may have shaved an impostor, and in drinking your wine, you may have been pouring refreshment down the throat of a rogue. When a man is without his shadow, what assurance is there that himself is he? But when one's reflex is present, he may, in some cases, be satisfied that money put in his own pocket, is not intrusted to the care of a peculator. And in this way is it that wisdom derives comfort from the phenomenon that we have attempted to explain. Is the citizen martially inclined, and does he attend volunteer parades, to gratify the heroic longings of his soul by having his toes macerated by iron heels, his ribs 15* compressed by ruffian elbows, or his abdominal capacity astonished by the musket-but of the authoritative sentinel, who knocks the breath out of your body, while politely exclaiming “stand back, gentlemen; a little further, if you please!” There is his attendant lounger, in the best of possible places, and safely beyond the reach of the mobrepressing guard. Is the foiled pickpocket borne triumphantly to office of Recorder, Alderman or Mayor? Look ye now and see. Within the rail of official function, close to magisterial dignity, there stands your ghost, your “bodach glas;” not antecedent or consequent, but instant. No need to wish, or call, or wonder at his absence. You are here, and he is—there—cause and effect, linked together by hooks of steel. 'Tis your alter ego—your t'other eye. Do you attend the burial of a friend, and walk in gloom and silent sorrow? Dash aside your tears, and behold, leaning against that funeral tree which overshadows the sad procession, an evidence is apparent that even in grief your unknown coadjutor is true to his vocation. You will never be deserted—never! Are you essentially humane, taking delight to see murder choked and homicide made breathless, that the world may become tender-hearted and averse to horrors by familiarity with Ketch's delectable countenance? “That man” is helping to support the rectangular superstructure which reforms men by the speedy dislocation of their vertebral column, and improves the age by the disjointing of necks. He and Ketch seem to be sworn brothers. But fear not. Though this circumstance of yours be something that cannot be avoided, either by secresy respecting your movements—for he is an intuition—by rapidity of travel—for he is ubiquitous—or by cunning evasion—for he is instinctive—yet no harm appears ever to have arisen from this species of Chang and Engship— from this disjunctive Siamese twinnery, if we may so venture upon a terminological experiment, and coin a phrase to distinguish an unnamed idea. The “inevitable” may be sad in his expression; but he shows no sign of being mischievous in his soul, nor is his observation sarcastic in its conclusions. He is a student of humanity, ever at his book, but rather touched with melancholy at the lession thus derived, than made misanthropic by a knowledge of our weaknesses and follies. Exulting beauty passes by him, and at the “rustling of silks and the creaking of shoes,” which have betrayed so many hearts, he sighs to think that a bad cold or a misdirected bucket would soon reduce that joyousness to the most pitiable plight. He looks plaintively at the unheeding dog, who, ignorant of laws, and with muzzle at home, sports onward to the fell clutches of the sordid Sambo, to whom canine slaughter is a trade and profit; and he draws analogies between puppyhood and youthful prime, revelling in wild delights, and unwarned of “ketchers” till they are caught. The lounger is a lonely moralist, who has too much general sympathy to isolate affection by contracting his sphere of usefulness—too disinterested to narrow himself down to a pursuit of selfish aggrandizement—too full of heart to be cooped within the ribs of a trade, and too anxious about the general welfare ever to give rest to his anxious eye. He is the general guardian—the foster mother of us all; and perhaps it is our ignorance alone that regards him as being exclusive in his attentions; just as childhood thinks that a portrait watches all its movements, or as the moon seems marching above our heads wherever we go. Such as we have described is Nicholas Nollikins—he with the breastpin—he who watches so intently the shaving, evolved and elaborated from its parent stick by the keen edge of his whittle. Though Nollikins appears to be cutting, and it is reasonable to suppose that he is cutting, yet Nollikins is also thinking. In fact, he is a sage—not such as they stuff ducks withal, or liquidate into medicinal tea—but that sort of sage which has sagacity for its result, better far than ducks or teas. Nollikins, however, labours under a difficulty. He is reflective and observant, but not practical. He never comes to the application, for that word is particularly what he dislikes; and hence the deep river of his probable usefulness has its perfect navigation interrupted by a dam in the channel. His ships never come to port. Nollikins has in his time tried many trades; but none of them agreed with him, except the office of being midshipman to an oyster boat, and there were points even in this profession which were repugnant to his finer emotions. “Raking” on dry land is not perhaps so disagreeable; but let those who think that words are identical and synonymous, and represent the same thing at sea and ashore, try raking for oysters, as Nicholas Nollikins did for a whole season, and they will ever after have a correct appreciation of differences. When the boat returned to the wharf, Nicholas was at home. His taste for society could now be gratified. The delicate aspirations of his nature found food in the distribution of oysters, and his imagination had room to expand as he opened the bivalves. What a delightful compound of business and pleasure is that phase of the oyster trade which sells wholesale, but yet does not scorn the niceties of retail to the hungry wanderer! Benevolence and information are here combined—to talk and to eat—to question and to impart nourishment—to benefit both the physique and the morale at the same time—who would not be midshipman of an oyster boat—who could not live whole days at the wharf, under such circumstances? Nollikins could—Nollikins did—thrice happy Nollikins! But the genial sky always has clouds in it—a spring morning, be it as balmy as it may, is generally followed by a cloudy afternoon. When oysters are sold and eaten, it is a necessity, arising from the unfortunate state of things in this sublunary sphere, that you must go after additional oysters—that is, if you want more; for oysters, unlike the accommodating shad, have not yet learned to come up the river of themselves, that they may be caught at the very door. Few things, in the eating way, have that innate politeness so remarkable in the character of a shad. Had the shad been blessed with feet and hands, there cannot be a doubt but that it would complete its measure of complaisance by walking up the street and ringing at the bell, with a civil inquiry for the cook and the gridiron. It would come about half an hour before breakfast, and never defer its call till after tea. Commend us to the shad, as the best mannered fish that swims. Many men might go to school to the shad; and indeed, if our piscatory learning be not at fault, the shad do assemble in schools, to which cause possibly may be attributed the excellence of their training. Always bow with deference to a shad—it has travelled far to enjoy the pleasure of your acquaintance. The oyster, however, is churlish—it makes no free visitation, and upon this fact hinges the fate of Nicholas Nollikins. He could not abide the painful contrast which was brought home to his sensibilities, by the change from the wharf to the cove— from society to solitude—from the delicate play of the iron-handled knife, (so favourable to the exhibition of grace and skill,) to the heavy drag of rakes and tongs in the oyster bed; and he, therefore, concluded to resign his regular commission, and to obtain his living for the future by dabbling only in the fancy branches of human employment. When the boats come up, he has no objection to taking a place, for the time being, as salesman to the concern; and in this way, working only when urgent necessity compels, and consuming the rest of his existence in the ornamentals of life, such as leaning against a post and speculating on the chances and changes of terrestrial affairs, our worthy Nicholas contrives to bite the sunny side from the peach, leaving the green core for those who are mean enough to be content with it. Nicholas has a home, upon a desperate emergency; but he does not trouble it often with his presence, for reasons which he regards as perfectly adequate to excuse any delinquency in this respect, which calumnious tongues may think proper to lay to his charge. “As for goin' home, Billy Bunkers,” said he, one day, in confidence to the long lad with the short roundabout, who leans upon the opposite side of the lamp post; “as for goin' home, Billy, savin' and exceptin' when you can't help it, why it's perfectly redicklis. If people's opinyins could be made to agree, that would be one thing, and you might go home. But as these opinyins don't agree, why that's another thing, and it's best to clear out and keep out, jist as long as you kin. What's your sitivation when you do go home? There's the old man, and there's the old voman and the rest of them, hurtin' your feelins as bad as if they was killin' kittens with a brickbat. As soon as you're inside of the door, they sing out like good fellers, `Eh, waggybone!—Ho! ho! lazyboots!— hellow, loafer!—ain't you most dead a workin' so hard?— t'aint good for your wholesome to be so all-fired industrious!' That's the way they keep a goin' on, aggravatin' you for everlastin'. They don't understand my complaint—they can't understand a man that's lookin' up to better things. I tell you, Billy,” exclaimed Nicholas, with tears in his eyes, “when a feller's any sort of a feller, like you and me—” “Yes,” replied Billy, complacently; “we're the fellers —it takes us.” “When a feller's any sort of a feller, to be ketched at home is little better than bein' a mouse in a wire-trap. They poke sticks in your eye, squirt cold water on your nose, and show you to the cat. Common people, Billy— low, ornery, common people, can't make it out when natur's raised a gentleman in the family—a gentleman all complete, only the money's been forgot. If a man won't work all the time—day in and day out—if he smokes by the fire or whistles out of the winder, the very gals bump agin him and say `get out of the way, loaf!' Now what I say is this—if people hasn't had genteel fotchin' up, you can no more expect 'em to behave as if they had been fotch up genteel, than you can make good cigars out of a broom handle.” “That are a fact,” ejaculated Billy Bunkers, with emphasis; for Billy has experienced, in his time, treatment at home somewhat similar to that complained of by Nicholas Nollikins. “But, Billy, my son, never mind, and keep not a lettin' on,” continued Nollikins, and a beam of hope irradiated his otherwise saturnine countenance; “the world's a railroad and the cars is comin'—all we'll have to do is to jump in, chalked free. There will be a time—something must happen. Rich widders are about yet, though they are snapped up so fast. Rich widders, Billy, are `special providences,' as my old boss used to say when I broke my nose in the entry, sent here like rafts to pick up deservin' chaps when they can't swim no longer. When you've bin down twy'st, Billy, and are jist off agin, then comes the widder a floatin' along. Why, splatterdocks is nothin' to it, and a widder is the best of all life-preservers, when a man is most a case, like you and me.” “Well, I'm not perticklar, not I, nor never was. I'll take a widder, for my part, if she's got the mint drops, and never ask no questions. I'm not proud—never was harrystocratic—I drinks with anybody, and smokes all the cigars they give me. What's the use of bein' stuck up, stiffy? It's my principle that other folks are nearly as good as me, if they're not constables nor aldermen. I can't stand them sort.” “No, Billy,” said Nollikins, with an encouraging smile, “no, Billy, such indiwidooals as them don't know human natur'—but, as I was goin' to say, if there happens to be a short crop of widders, why can't somebody leave us a fortin?—That will do as well, if not better. Now look here—what's easier than this? I'm standin' on the wharf—the rich man tries to go aboard of the steamboat—the niggers push him off the plank—in I jumps, ca-splash! The old gentleman isn't drownded; but he might have been drownded but for me, and if he had a bin, where's the use of his money then? So he gives me as much as I want now, and a great deal more when he defuncts riggler, accordin' to law and the practice of civilized nations. You see—that's the way the thing works. I'm at the wharf every day—can't afford to lose a chance, and I begin to wish the old chap would hurra about comin' along. What can keep him?” “If it 'ud come to the same thing in the end,” remarked Billy Bunkers, “I'd rather the niggers would push the old man's little boy into the water, if it's all the same to him. Them fat old fellers are so heavy when they're skeered, and hang on so—why, I might get drownded before I had time to go to bank with the check! But what's the use of waitin'? Couldn't we shove 'em in some warm afternoon, ourselves? Who'd know in the crowd?” “I've thought of that, Bunkers, when a man was before me that looked like the right sort. I've often said to myself, `My friend, how would you like to be washed for nothin'?'—but, Billy, there might be mistakes—perhaps, when you got him out, he couldn't pay. What then?” “Why, keep a puttin' new ones in to soak every day, till you do fish up the right one.” “It won't do, my friend—they'd smoke the joke— all the riff-raff in town would be pushin' old gentlemen into the river, and the elderly folks would have to give up travellin' by the steamboat. We must wait, I'm afeared, till the real thing happens. The right person will be sure to come along.” “I hope so; and so it happens quick, I don't much care whether it's the old man, or his little boy, or that rich widder, that gets a ducking. I'm not proud.” “And when it does happen,” exclaimed Nollikins, swelling with a triumphant anticipation, “who but me, with more beard than a nannygoat, and a mile of gold chain, goin' up Chestnut street! Who but Nollikins, with his big dog!” “Yes, and Billy Bunkers, with two big dogs, a chasin' the pigs into the chaney shops.” “Then you'll see me come the nonsense over the old folks—who's loafer now!—and my dog will bite their cat—who's ginger-pop and jam spruce beer, at this present writin', I'd like to know!” And, in a transport of enthusiasm, Nollikins knocked the hat of Billy Bunkers, a shallow, dishlike castor, clear across the street. Thus, wrapped in present dreams and future anticipations—a king that is to be—lives Nicholas Nollikins— the grand exemplar of the corner loungers. There he stations himself; for hope requires a boundless prospect and a clear look out, that, by whatever route fortune chooses to approach, she may have a prompt reception. Nicholas and his tribe exist but for to-morrow, and rely firmly upon that poetic justice, which should reward those who wait patiently until the wheel of fortune turns up a prize. They feel, by the generous expansion of their souls, by their impatience of ignoble toil, by their aspirations after the beautiful and nice, that their present position in society is the result of accident and inadvertency, and that, if they are not false to the nature that is within them, the time must come when the mistake will be rectified, and “they shall walk in silk attire and siller hae to spare,” which is not by any means the case at present. All that can be expected just now, is, that they should spare other people's “siller.” STEREOTYPED BY L. JOHNSON, PHILADELPHIA. THE END.</field>

He has given us St. Petersburgh by winter and by summer, by day and by night; with its Neva, canals, quays, markets, shops, houses—each swarming with its respective population, not stiffly drawn as if sitting for their picture, but caught in full life and movement, song, laugh and talk hit off in every shade and grade of mind, habit, speech and costume, under every aspect of feasting and fasting, buying and selling, driving and walking, idling, smoking, teaching and learning, baptizing and burying; and all with a truth and vivacity which would be impossible to surpass.” —London Quarterly Review. HOWITT'S RURAL AND DOMESTIC LIFE IN GERMANY. Two vols. Price Fifty Cents. “There is a healthy love of nature in these volumes, a quick, manly observation, a sincere and inquiring spirit, what we call an English feeling for old and homely associations; much that pleases by its hearty good sense, and nothing that teases by its alarming profundity.” —London Examiner, January, 1843.</field>

The August No. of Blackwood's Magazine, in a long and able review work, remarks: “The Life of Lord Eldon is an important addition to public biography. Written by a lawyer, it has the advantage of professional knowledge—by a man of a certain experience in public and even in official life, it exhibits that practical knowledge of affairs which nothing but practice can gain The three volumes exhibit a research which does credit to the intelligence and industry of Mr Twiss Their anecdotes, but few of which we have been able to give, possess passages of very effective writing, and form a work which ought to be in the library of every lawyer, statesman and English gentleman.” —Black wood's Magazine, August, 1844. THE LIFE AND TIMES OF RICHARD THE THIRD. By CAROLINE HALSTED. In One Vol. 8vo. “Miss Halsted deserves great credit for her laborious attempt to vindicate Richard's character, and for the patient care with which she has sought out and marshalled her authorities. Although we may not believe Richard to have been quite so blameless as she attempts to prove him, we willingly allow that his real character was widely different from that which tradition and Tudor history has assigned to him.” —London Athenœum. “One of the most intensely interesting volumes ever published.” CHEAP EDITION. THE WORKS OF THE REV. SYDNEY SMITH. Complete in Three Nos. at 25 Cents each. Uniform with “Macaulay's Miscellaneous Writings.” “Although wit is the great predominating characteristic of the writings of Sydney Smith, the finest and most original humour is not unfrequently displayed.” “Sydney Smith in hostility is an overwheiming antagonist, his arguments are glittering with laughter and well balanced with good sense: they flow on ward with the ease and certainty of a current above a bright cascade: he piles up his merriment like a grotesque mausoleum over his enemy, and so compactly and regularly that we feel no fear of its toppling over by any retort.” —New Spirit of the Age.</field>
