      <field name="fulltext">MARY HOLLIS. Many persons, in the village of ———, in Massachusetts, remember Mary Lowe, a diligent, ingenious little girl of a respectable family, who was left an orphan when quite young, with a very slender provision, which her guardians wisely expended, in obtaining for her a decent education and the tayloring trade. She went from house to house, eating her bread in singleness of heart. She was approved by the elderly and judicious, for her prudent, industrious, and quiet ways; and she made herself the delight of all the children, by her obliging disposition and good humour. The little boys said, “Mary would always put pockets in their clothes;” and the older boys, who longed to be emancipated from the indignity of having their clothes made by a woman-taylor, were still conciliated by Mary's gentle manners, and a little, too, by the smart look which she contrived to give to their apparel. I think I can see her now bending over her goose, and as it heavily trod the seams, singing some playful song to the little group around her; and smiling and blushing as she caught the approving glances of the elders of the family. But poor Mary was not destined to glide down the stream of life, without experience of the storms that ruffle its current. She married William Hollis, and was, by a series of misfortunes, reduced from comfortable circumstances to penury. There was nothing extraordinary in her case. Every one has occasion to notice the swift destruction that comes upon a family, when the husband resigns himself to habits of intemperance. Intemperance leads, necessarily, to idleness. Health and strength disappear, and confusion takes the place of order. It seems to make little difference, whether the unhappy slave of this vice has been accustomed to careful and diligent habits, or brought up to idleness; whether born to fortune, or to earn his bread by the sweat of his brow. In one case the ruin may be nearer than in another, but in all cases, ruin is inevitable. It is not now my purpose to trace the steps of William Hollis, from the time when he was an industrious apprentice at the shoe-making trade. Who, that then saw him issue from his master's dwelling on a Sunday morning, with the cheerful look of youth, the health and vigor of dawning manhood, neatly equipped for church, would have recognized him a few years after, returning from a tavern brawl on a Saturday night, to his much-enduring wife, and breaking on the quiet of his home, with the voice of cursing! It was after one of those scenes of excess, which had, of late, become more frequent, that, with just enough of reason left to direct his steps towards his own dwelling, he left his noisy companions. His house was at one extremity of the village, and, with a few other mean buildings around it, was usually occupied by its poorest inhabitants. A bye and narrow road led to it. William's instinct had often guided him safely, but on this occasion he had drank more than usual, and after reeling on till he had nearly finished his way, the feeble ray of light that shot through the patched panes of his own window, caught his eyes, A 2 and to his cloudy vision, it seemed to dance from one side of the way to the other. He was cursing its uncertain aid, when he stumbled and fell senseless to the ground. The noise of his fall, accompanied by a loud groan, called one of his neighbours, Samuel Hill, to his assistance. Hill brought a lantern, and discovered that the poor creature was quite senseless. He had, in falling, hit his head against a large stone, which had been rolled to the door, to serve the purpose of a horseblock.— This compassionate neighbour called some others to his aid. They conveyed him in their arms to his wife. It was too common a circumstance for him to stay out late, to excite any alarm in her. She had closed the labours of the week, and by her neatness and exertion, given to her home the appearance of order and comfort, that betokens a preparation for the Lord's day. Her eldest child, a girl of six years, was sitting on a little bench by the fire, reading aloud in the testament: two of the children were asleep in their bed, and a sick infant, lying in the arms of its mother, whose meek and care-worn countenance, as the light fell strongly upon it, from the bright flame of a pine knot, showed that her thoughts were divided between the troubles of this world, and the consolations of the word to which she was listening. At this moment the door opened, and disclosed to her neighbours the peace that even the “wicked cannot trouble.” They paused, for an instant, from a strong feeling of compassion and respect. The noise had called the attention of Mrs. Hollis.— Immediately she became pale as death, and uttered a deep groan; then exerting a self-command, for which she was remarkable, she laid her sick baby beside her sleeping brothers, and telling the little girl to lay down beside her sister to keep her warm, she spread open her own bed, and asked the men to lay her husband in it. Alas! this was not the first time he had been brought to her in a brutish condition. Mary had always avoided the sympathy of her neighbours: she had never been heard to speak of her husband's vices, and some wondered, that Mary Hollis was so blind she could not see them. Others sneeringly observed, “there were none so blind as those that would not see.” But, when no eye saw, but His who pitieth all our sorrows, her tears flowed, and her prayers ascended, that the sinner might be converted from the error of his ways, and that she might be sustained under the burthen of her sorrows. She was not like some, who, when they have prayed they may do their duty, are apt to think their duty is accomplished. Her prayers were used as the means of strength, and she felt, after communing with the Father of Spirits, that a ray of light marked the path of duty, through the day. William was the father of her children, and it was her incessant care to shield his faults from them. When he was sober, he was kind and affectionate to his children, and his wife, in the main; and when he was intoxicated, Mary sought to remove his children from his sight. But, anxious as she was to hide the father's vices, she never resorted to falsehood, for she knew she must not do evil that good might come. Her children were young and unsuspicious, therefore it was not difficult to keep them ignorant. Mary thanked the men for their kindness, and was saying, she should not need any further assistance, when as she drew the bed clothes over her husband, she saw that his pale face was stained with blood. “He is hurt!” cried she. “To be sure he is,” said Hill, who had been hitherto awed into silence, by Mary's unexpected calmness; “and it is a wonder to me, if he comes to himself this night. Such a bruise as that, and on the temple too, is a pretty bad affair.” “Can one of you go for the Doctor,” said Mary in a trembling voice. Hill sent one of his companions, and dismissed the other, kindly offering himself to stay. He assisted Mary in applying such remedies as the house afforded, but they were without effect. The Doctor came. He examined the wound, and felt the patient's pulse. “Nothing can be done,” said he. Poor Mary was, for a moment, speechless with agonv, “Oh!” she then exclaimed, “my poor husband! could he but offer one prayer, could he but speak to me once more!” She sunk on her knees by the side of the unhappy man. Little Sally, unaccustomed to see her mother in any agitation, uttered a shriek of terror. The infant, awakened by the confusion, moaned greviously, but Mary was insensible to every thing but the misery of her dying husband. She continued kneeling, holding William's cold hand in hers, and pouring out her soul in prayers for him. In about an hour, his whole frame became convulsed, he rolled up his eyes, and extended his arms. It was the last struggle. Poor William closed his eyes forever, an early victim of intemperance. Tender mothers, faithful wives, solitary sufferers, may conceive of Mary's misery. There were some who said “Mary Hollis professes to be a christian, and it does not become a christian to be so cast down.” Others said, “If she had lost the best husband in the world, she could not mourn more.” But it was, precisely, because she was a christian, and, because her unhappy husband was not only, not the best, but was one for whom she must sorrow without hope, that she thus mourned—Mary dared not even hope, for her bible told her, “The drunkard hath not eternal life.” There was no good word of promise there, for the impenitent sinner. It was true, William had sometimes, after uncommon excess, and the suffering consequent thereupon, formed good resolutions and made solemn promises; but perhaps the very next occasion of temptation would find him as weak and yielding as ever; and Mary felt, that such penitence deepened the shade of his guilt. “Oh!” she would say in the bitterness of her heart, “could any sinner look upon my wretched William and waste the precious hours of probation! Oh! that they could realize, that the destiny of ages depends upon their moments of time.” Could Mary have borne her sorrows, if she could have permitted them to prey on her mind? The poor have a blessing in the necessity of labour, that outweighs many of the splendid favours, which they see, perhaps, with envy, in the scale of the rich. Mary had never lived to herself, and, for the first time in her life, this strong and overwhelming tide of grief bore away with resistless force, the claims of others, and made her forget, in the indulgence of her sorrow, the wants of the destitute little creatures around her. The day after the funeral of her husband, Mary was sitting in a stupor of grief from which she was roused, by the crying of one of the little boys. “Sally,” said she, “what does John cry for?” “Mother,” replied the child, with a faultering voice, “John is hungry. The bread and meat Mr. Hill brought, was all finished yesterday, and we've none of us had any breakfast.” The pressing wants of her children, recalled the Mother to a sense of her duty. “Oh!” said she, “I must feed these lambs, and with the help of God, I will feed them, with temporal and spiritual food.” She drew her children to her, and kneeling down, she dedicated herself and offspring to Him, who is the `Husband of the widow, and the Father of the fatherless.” Her thoughts turned on her poor William, and for the first time, since the stroke had fallen on her, she heartily submitted to it, and was able to say with complete resignation, though not without agony. `Thy will be done.' She had laid her troubles at His feet, who careth for us, and in the service in which she was engaged, she found a peace which enabled her quietly to bear the yoke, that had seemed an intolerable burthen. She rose from her devotions, with her heart strengthened for duty. Any one, who had seen the serenity of her countenance, and the energy of her movements, must have thought she had heard the gracious words, `Fear not, for I am with you.' Immediate relief was necessary, and Mrs. Hollis had none of that pride, which sometimes makes people ashamed of their poverty, when it fails to impel them to those exertions which are necessary to escape from it. She sent her child to her neighbour Hill's, to ask for a loaf of bread. It was freely given, but Mrs. Hill had not grace enough to restrain her tongue, as the door closed after little Sally. “There is no pride that can stand every thing. I have known the time, when Mary Hollis would rather starve to death, than to have asked for a piece of bread. I am sure I am sorry for her, but it is strange how much some folks must suffer, before they are humbled. Pride must have a fall, and it's best it should:— not but what I feel for her,—but the Lord knows who needs the rod.” Mrs. Hill's husband was too much used to the talking of his wife to give much heed to it on common occasions, but he had tender feelings, and the sorrows of his neighbour had touched his heart. “Yes,” said he, “the Lord knows who needs it; and though I don't profess to read the Bible as much as you do, that says, he chasteneth whom he loveth; and besides, Betsy, I'm thinking that it is not easy always, to understand the ways of the Lord, nor safe nor charitable to explain his judgments. Does not the Saviour say `judge not lest ye be judged,' and how does he reprove his disciples when he says, `of those eighteen men on whom the tower of Siloam fell, think ye they were sinners above all the men that dwell in Jerusalem?” Betsy was checked for a moment,—albeit unused to hear her husband quote the Bible,—but collecting all her forces, “Any body” said she, “can serve themselves with a text here and there, but it takes grace to understand them. Now, John, do you believe any thing but pride could keep Mary Hollis out of her bed spinning and weaving till 12 o'clock by the light of the fire, just to get a piece out of the loom, to fit her children for Sunday school, when the Ladies' charitable Society agreed to clothe all the poor children? No, no, John, destruction is sure to come after pride, for Solomon says, `The Lord will destroy the house of the proud.” “Yes,” said John, “and establish the border of the widow:—and a blessing, I believe, is in store for Mary Hollis. If every woman was like her, it would not take some hard days' work for you and I to pay our poor's tax.” This was an argument which had some weight with Mrs. Hill. “Far be it from me,” she said “to discourage any one's working, but I like to see that people feel their situation. If Mary Hollis had been like other people, I should not blame her for working hard, but never could I get one word out of her about her troubles. She never owned that her husband drank,—that is, never said any thing about it; and many a time, when he had one of his frolics, I have been there, to have a little neighbour-like talk with her,—to tell her, how much every body pitied her, and that such troubles were not sent upon her for nothing. She would say, that what troubles she had, it was easier for her to bear than to complain of; and then she never failed to turn to talking about something else. Oh! it is enough, to provoke a saint, to see any body so wilful.” John, certainly, did not think silence a provocation, nor his wife quite a saint, but his reply, which, perhaps, would have had more justice than discretion in it, was interrupted by the return of little Sally, who came to say “her mother would be obliged to Mr. Hill, to ask Mr. Germain (the minister) to call at her mother's, and her mother would be glad to speak with Mrs. Hill.” Betsy Hill, mollified by the expectation of confidence, was not a little chagrined, when she found all Mrs. Hollis wished was to effect an exchange of commodities with her, to supply the present necessities of her children. She offered Mrs. Hill her best gown, the relict of better days, for some pork and potatoes. Betsy was not thought a hard-hearted woman, but no occasion ever tempted her to discredit her sense, by making a bad bargain; and as selfishness is too apt to make us overvalue our own possessions, her bargains were not always strictly just. After a careful scrutiny of the gown, and many remarks upon the damages done by time, the present reduced price of goods, &amp;c. to all which, Mrs. Hollis listened patiently, and replied mildly, the terms of sale were adjusted to the satisfaction of both parties. It was a principle with Mary, never to beg, while she could by any exertion or self-denial, do without it; but no one could more gratefully receive a kindness. The minister of the village, was, in the gospel sense, the overseer of his flock. His first duty he knew, was to minister to their spiritual wants; but, that being done, he did not leave the rest undone. His benevolent heart was continually devising good, and his strong, practical mind, contriving some mode for its application. His wife was a fellow-worker with him, and the sobriety, industry and order of their household, were an excellent comment on the public preaching of the Pastor. No scoffer could ever say, “Mr. Germain, knew how to preach better than to practice.” No infidel could point you in derision to his family, as exemplifiying the impotence of the principles he taught; but a numerous family, early inured to difficult exertions, and painful self-denials, to habits of temperance, obedience and love, exhibited the blessedness of a well ordered household. His people, witnessing the effects of his wisdom, had confidence in it, and sought, in all cases of difficulty in their temporal affairs, his advice; and many there were among them who referred the prosperity of their families to the salutary counsels of their beloved pastor. The good man had anticipated the wants of Mary, and was already on his way to her, when he met Hill. They naturally, fell into conversation on Mary's embarrassments. Hill said, “that a lone woman as she was, and none of the strongest, she must put her children upon the town;—that her husband, though he was bad enough, had contributed something to the support of his family, but if his wife had not been the best christian in the world, they could never have kept it together.” “Ah! John,” said Mr. Germain, “I am glad to find you think a man better off, for having a christian wife.” “Certainly I do sir, if she be a real christian.” “Well, and what do you call a real christian?” John was a little daunted, and hesitated, fearing, perhaps, that his definition might not be agreeable to the common ideas of the christian character, but his zealous admiration of Mary's bright virtues, augmented, perhaps, by his involuntary setting them in contrast to the deep shades of his own rough mate, gave him courage to proceed. “Why, sir, I call a woman a christian, that is as patient as Job, and has full as many troubles;—for what can be worse to one who fears and serves God as she does, than to have a drunken husband come staggering and swearing home? I call a woman a christian, that works from morning till night, to get bread for her family, and is never heard to scold or mutter. I call a woman a christian, sir, that's got proud relations, that despise her, and neighbours that are always picking at her, and yet has never been known to notice or complain of it, though she feels it. I am certain of that; for I remember her little girl came crying home from school one day, when I was there, and said her cousin Anne Mason, would not sit on the bench beside her, and said her mother B told her to have nothing to say to Sally Hollis. I saw Mary's cheek was the colour of scarlet, and the tear glistened in her eye, but it took her but a minute to come to herself; and then she said, `My dear child, your anger is almost as bad as Anne's pride. Act well, and no good person will despise you, because you are poor.” “Oh, Mr. Germain,—you said in your sermon, a meek spirit is worth all the riches of this world.” “But,” said Mr. Germain, willing further to try John's estimate of a christian, “is that all, John? You give Mary great praise, but you speak only of what is called morality.” “Mr. Germain,” exclaimed John, “I did not think to find you among them that despise morality. I know a great many people cry down morality, but to my mind, it stands to reason, that such morality as Mary Hollis' must come from religion. It is obedience to the laws of God, made known to us by his Son. I don't believe any thing but the grace of God can help any one through such a sea of troubles. Why, sir, it is as much of a miracle, if we could but see it in that light, as Peter's walking on the sea; and Mary would have sunk long ago, if her faith had not kept her up. It may be, sir, you think Mary is not a christian, because you do not see her at meeting so often as my wife, and some other women:—I mean no offence, but I'm thinking Mary is more in the way of her duty, keeping at home, working for her children, and setting an example that's better than the catechism to them;— and besides, sir, she does not forget other duties neither. Many's the time that I have seen her, when I looked into her window as I passed by, kneeling with her little ones about her. Of a sabbath, she is always sure to be at meeting, and her children with her; not kept at home, as some I know, because they have not smart clothes to wear there. Besides, Mr. Germain, Mary is a member of your church, can it be, that you dont think her a christian?” Mr. Germain certainly did think her a christian, and one of the highest order, and he answered John, that he looked upon her as an ensample to the whole flock, and that he was glad to find that he had such correct notions of christian duty. John made some apology for having dared to preach before the minister, and Mr. Germain kindly parted from him, shaking his hand, and telling him that he wished he could always preach as good a sermon as he had heard that morning. Mr. Germain found Mary composed. “The waters” he said to her, “have compassed you about, but have not overwhelmed you, my friend.” “No, sir,” she replied, “I have found a resting place: I know all is right; and I feel, that as the `eagle fluttereth over her young,' so I, and my little ones, are gathered under the sheltering wings of Him who will not leave nor forsake us. I am a feeble instrument in his hands, of myself, quite insufficient for these things. But I have submitted to his rebuke, and I feel a strength made perfect in my weakness, for the duties that are before me.” Mary then entered into an explanation of her situation. She said, it had been her steady aim to keep out of debt, that if her husband had seen his fault he might have been free from any discouragement to reformation. She had thought it better to do without what seemed even necessary to the family, than incur a debt, where she could not see her way clear to pay it. If she had not, she could not have felt that she was strictly honest; for what was it, but taking from others what she was not sure of being able to return. Some, she said, had blamed her for not soliciting charity.— She believed it was not pride that had withheld her;— there were some who could not live without charity, and while she could she dared not encroach on their rights. She had not even a mite to give, and therefore she had felt more anxious not to take the portion from those more needy than herself. Her voice trembled as she proceeded to say, that she feared there was a bill against them at the tavern. She would thank Mr. Germain most kindly, to ascertain for her.— “I cannot” said she, “send my child to enquire.— I cannot go myself.” She burst into tears. Mr. Germain assured her it should be attended to. Her husband's work-benches and utensils, she hoped, would raise enough to discharge the debt. She had a cow; but as there was no provision for it, that must be sold, —that would bring something, but she feared not enough, with all that she could do, to carry her children through the long winter before them. Sally, she said, was nine years old, and, perhaps, her services in a family, as she was an industrious, handy child, might be thought an equivalent for her support. The three younger children she should endeavour to keep with her. Although Mr. Germain had a favourable opinion of Mary, he had not thought her capable of such energetic plans. She had a mild, quiet way with her, and he had fallen into a common mistake, in regard to unpretending characters, that she was rather formed to suffer, than to act. He expressed with cordiality and paternal kindness, his approbation of all her plans, and left her with an assurance that he would immediately attend to her request. Mr. Germain was not one of those who satisfy themselves with intending to do good, and quiet their consciences with a few benevolent emotions. He remembered, that it was the servant who did the will of his Master, and not he who promised to do it, that was approved by him. There is a good maxim with notable housewives, “a stitch in time saves nine.” The same proportion may be observed in the economy of benevolence;—there delay is often ruinous. Mr. Germain's people often wondered that he who accomplished so much, should have so much leisure; but those who wisely ceased to wonder that they might learn, observed a habit of method, which entered into all his arrangements, and one rule from which he was never known to deviate, not to put off till tomorrow, what may as well be done to-day. The past, he would say, has gone with its record to the Most High. We cannot count upon an hour of the future; the present is all we possess, and is a talent for which we must render our account. In obedience to his general rule, Mr. Germain went immediately to the tavern. He found the bar room empty. As he entered it, his eye was attracted by the chalked accounts, which were scrawled on its smoked and dirty wall. He soon detected poor William's among them, and was so intent on ascertaining its amount, that he did not hear or heed the footsteps of a young man who entered and placed himself on the seat near him. As he finished the sad business, he heard adeep sigh, and turning, saw this man whose eye was eag erly fixed on him. He knew him, and knew the truth which his livid complexion and heavy eye proclaimed, that he was addicted to the destructive vice which ruins so many individuals, and renders their families the abodes of misery. “Young man,” said Mr. Germain,” this is a heavy score, but this can be wiped out. But who can now touch that account which is registered against the unhappy sinner in the great book? Oh! my friend, does not this hand-writing on the wall speak to your conscience? When you yesterday, followed your companion to the silent, solitary grave, did no thought follow his spirit to the presence of the Judge? Be admonished—use the day of reprieve—cast not away the mercy that is offered to you. `Escape for thy life, look not behind thee.' More than death awaits thee here,—the destruction of soul and body in hell.” The conscience of the unhappy man was a wakened; he covered his face with his hands and sobbed aloud. B Mr. Germain was moved, “My Friend,” said he, “I trust these are tears of penitence, and that they will lead you back to your Fathers' house where there is room enough and to spare. You have a difficult task before you, but you are yet young. Steady resolution in the fear of God, will have the blessing of God. Abandon this haunt,—forsake the seducing society of your companions, that you may not be a partaker of their evil deeds; apply yourself, constantly, to your business, and seek your pleasure in your family. Oh! what a feast will the gratitude of your good wife, and the prosperity of your little children be to you, after the husks you have fed on.” These were words spoken in season, and that was an hour never forgotten by the penitent. Mr. Germain visited him often, encouraging and confirming him in his good resolations. And when sorrow or disappointment has sometimes borne heavily on this good man,—as who can escape it in this world! his heart has been cheered, by the sight of the healthy cheerful countenance of the reformed man, as he passed him, at work on his flourishing little farm. “Oh!” he would say to Mr. Germain,” that, I could persuade others to exchange the way of the transgressor which is hard indeed, for paths of perfect peace.” But to return to Mary's business. Mr. Germain, found a purchaser for all the contents of William's workshop, and their avails satisfied the tavern reckoning. He then went to lay Mary's case before a benevolent Lady, to whose aid and advice he often had recourse, Mrs. —, suggested that a contribution might be easily obtained from the families in the neighbourhood, who well might afford, to spare enough from their fulness to save Mary the necessity of parting with her cow. A collection of provisions was accordingly made, and sent to her, and most thankfully received by Mary. A few days after, her neighbour, Mrs. Hill, called to see her. After sitting awhile, she said to Mrs. Hollis. “Folks say, you are agoing to put Sally out to Mrs. C—'s.” “No, I am not” said Mrs. Hollis. “Well I told them so, I knew better; I would starve to death, with my children, if I was you, before I would do it. To be sure, I have not got the pride that some people has; but, my spirit is above that; there is no knowing what we may be brought to, but I never can be brought to make my children wait upon any body. That's proper negroes' work, and it's for that, the mark has been kept upon them, since it was put upon Cain, who, the Bible says, was the first of their race.” There were so many opinions and principles advanced in this out-pouring of Betsy Hill, that her mild neighbour hardly knew what to reply to first. She calmly replied, “I believe the Bible does not say, that the coloured people are descended from Cain, and I cannot think, Mrs. Hill, that service is either a hardship or disgrace to those whom God has seen fit to place among the poor of this world.” “But,” said Mrs. Hill, (for she made great pretences to religion, and did not choose to appear negligent of its obligations) “I think it is a very wicked thing for people to hold their head so high, that they can't sit down at the same table with their hired people.— A'nt they children of one Father in Heaven, and ha'nt they got to lie down in the dust together? No, no, you will never make me believe it's right to live out, where you must be prisoned up in a kitchen, and as like as not, have a negro eat in the same room with you.” Mary could not restrain a smile, at the inconsistency of her neighbour, who, with one breath proclaimed a law of perfect equality, and at the next, shrunk instinctively from being placed on a level with those that she deemed below her. She was, however, too wise, to attempt to stem the current of Mrs. Hill's clamour. Her life was her argument, and, insensible, indeed, must that person have been, who was not touched by its eloquence. “You have,” said she, “perhaps mistaken me; I did not decline Mrs. C—'s offer on account of my child's being there obliged to do the work, and fill the place of a servant. She must serve, and I hope she will, in all `humility of mind.' Mrs. C— has a large disorderly family, her kitchen is filled with servants who keep up a scene of riot and contention, the family live without any observance of religion.— Even the sabbath, with them, is not a day of rest and quiet. I cannot expose my child to the dangers and temptations of such a family. Mrs. Martin has offered to take her.” “Mrs. Martin!” exclaimed Sally Hill, “Mrs. C— for my money, for all Mrs. Martin.” “I know well:” said Mary, some persons would think her too strict; but she is strict only in obliging her people to be diligent, orderly, neat, and regular. This is the yoke I wish my child to bear in her youth.” “Well,” said Betsy, “my advice has not been asked, and nobody is obliged to take it; but I would as soon let one of my children walk through the fire to Moloch, as go to live with the Martins. Some folks call them religious, but I believe the scripture, `it is impossible for a rich person to enter into the kingdom of Heaven.” “The scriptures say difficult, not impossible,” said Mary. “That's all the same, for the matter of that, but I can't but wonder at you. I should think you'd have more feeling for your child than to make a slave of her. The Martins have as many rules and regulations as kings and queens. Every night the doors are locked up by 10 o'clock, and if any of them are out after, they may freeze to death, but the door must not be opened. Then, there is a long list of laws pasted over the kitchen fire place, that I saw with my own eyes, and there is a punishment put against every rule for the breaking it.” “And a reward, is there not,” said Mary, “for those who observe the laws?” “I don't know any thing about that. There may be, but who wants rewards from such tyrants? Then, every night, after prayers, they are all told what to do the next day. I would as soon make a cart-horse of my child at once, as to have her driven day after day, without any mind of her own. All the girls she has brought up look like Quakers, they are dressed so plain.” “Yes,” said Mary, “and so comfortably.” “She can afford to make them comfortable. No thanks to her for that.” “Mrs. Hill,” said Mary, “Mrs. Martin's family is an example to every body, and I take it as a great favour from Him who has promised to be a `Father to the fatherless,' that my child is to be placed there.— She will have to work, but never beyond her years and strength; and work I consider a blessing. How many children do we know that are kept at home by mothers, who are either too proud to put them out to service, (for pride is in the cottage as well as in the palace,) or else have not resolution to part with them, who are brought up in idleness. We have not employment for our children at home. A poor man has not land for his boys to work on, and we have not in our houses, wherewith to keep the girls busy.—The boys, now and then get a few hours' work, an errand to do, or some little job; but these do not give them good habits, and we seldom see children that are carried along in this way, that prosper in the world. It is hard for me to put my child away from me, for she is a help and comfort to me, but I must consult my child's good, and not please myself at her expence.” This was a new mode of reasoning to Betsy, and one which she did not relish. She took her leave, muttering that there were none so deaf as those that would not hear. Mary did hear and obey,—not the ranting of her ill-judging neighbour, but the dictates of a conscience, void of offence toward God, and toward man. Mrs. Hollis was blessed with health;—time rolled on, and her little cottage, which had been stripped of almost every article, from time to time, to satisfy her husband's debts, began again to wear a look of comfort and plenty. Even Betsey Hill, who was not disposed to do Mary justice, said it was a wonder what luck some people had. Mary's luck was easily explained. She did not believe in witches, nor pretend to magic. After her husband's death, she resumed her old trade. Many persons, seeing her anxiety to support her family gave her work. She used to say, that her health and her time were her capital, and that it was her own fault, if the interest of such a stock did not support her. Many acts of friendship and generosity she received from Mrs. Martin, who would say it was a pleasure to give Mary Hollis any thing, she took such good care of all she had, “and 'gar'd the auld claithes look amaist as well as new.” When the boys were old enough, they were placed in the families of respectable farmers. The youngest girl remained with her Mother, who has taught her her trade. It is now 20 years since the dreadful night of William's death. Mrs. Martin has become a widow, and Sally is still with her, and a blessing, her kind employer says, she has proved to her. She is now Mrs. Martin's house-keeper, respected by all who know her, and beloved by her mistress, who places unlimited confidence in her. Mrs. Hollis eldest son, has gone to Ohio, with the son of his master, and settled on a thriving farm, which his fidelity and industry have earned. The second son has bought and paid for a little farm adjoining his mother's cottage, which he has repaired and enclosed with a neat fence. He has married a young girl brought up in Mrs. Martin's family, approved by his Mother, and loved by his sisters. Mrs. Hollis, has reserved to herself one room of her cottage, where she may be seen now in health and cheerfulness, blessing God, who permits her in her declining years to walk in “green pastures by the side of still waters.” Her youngest daughter plies her Mother's trade, and is as great a favourite with the present generation, as her Mother was with their predecessors.</field>
