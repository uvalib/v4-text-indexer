      <field name="fulltext">PROLOGUE. Through the deep shadows into the gay sunlight— through the trees, whose grand old trunks arise around us, whose mingling leaves wave in light and perfume above us—through the wild-wood paths, where the moss grows, and the flowers bloom—through the rocks that darken on either side, venerable with their ten thousand ages, beautiful with the vines that float along their hoary brows— through this dim old forest, where your foot falls without a sound, where your soul feels the presence of its God, and your whispered word is flung back by an hundred echoes— we will wander, on this calm summer eve. It is the Third of July, 1776. It is that serene evening hour, when the moss beneath your feet is varied with long belts of black and gold. It is the time when the deep quiet of nature—the distant sound of leaves and streams—the glow of the sun, shining his last, over cloud and sky, melts the heart, and steals it away, by gentle steps, to God. Then if we have never prayed, we will fall down and worship. Then if we have never felt the presence of God, in the awful cathedral aisle, where the smoke of the incense winds in snowy wreaths about the brow of the Blessed One, or encircles, with a veil of misty loveliness, the sad, sweet face of Mary our Mother, we will here feel our knees bend, our voices falter in prayer, our hearts go up to Heaven, even as the last ray of the setting sun melts gently up the sky. For this wild wood is the cathedral of Nature, where every tree that towers, every flower that bends to the sod, as though sleepy with voluptuous perfume, every ripple of the stream, every leaf of the bough, says, as it floats or shines, or blooms, or waves, “There is a God, and he is good, and all men are his children!” You may smile at this—cold hearts of the world—who never rise from counting your pennies; you may sneer, grave crities, who never felt a heart-throb, or owned one thought of beauty, or suffered one word of feeling to flow from your pen and make men's hearts beat quicker; but even you, in the calm evening hour, would kneel and worship God. For it is the Wissahikon. I will not bewilder your hearts with memories of the past, nor tell you that every old tree has its story, every foot of mossy earth its legend; nor point back into the brooding shadows of a thousand years, when that huge rock was an altar, that beautiful stream, winding in light and shadow, the baptismal font of a forgotten religion, while here, among these shadowy ravines, grouped the maidens, their bosoms beating beneath vestments of snowy white, the priests, arrayed in midnight hues, the sacrificial knife gleaming over their heads; the warriors, whose strange costume, and dark physiognomy, and weapons of battle, have long since passed from the memory of man. But I will ask you— Did you ever; on a winter night, when the snow was on the ground, and the light of the hearthside fire upon your face, lean gently back in your cushioned chair, and, with half-shut eyes, dream a voluptuous dream of a summer evening, with the lazy sunshine bathing great masses of leaves, while a supernatural stream wound softly along, among rocks, and flowers, and trees? Your dream is here! Then, on that winter night, while the wind howled without, half-closing your eyes, you saw a winding path, leading far down the dell, with sunshine gushing from below, and the boughs bending toward the ground until they touched the cups of the wild flowers? Your dream is here! Or, did you behold a cool, shady place in the midst of great forest trees, where the wild vines formed a circle of undulating leaves, and every leaf was kissing a flower;— where the moss, forming a carpet for your feet, seemed glad, as the occasional sunbeams stole over its surface, while a rugged limb, interlacing with slight branches, all woven together with flowers, formed the roof of this perfumed forest home? Your dream is here! Or, did you, with your face still glowing in that hearthside light, wish to escape the beams of the July sun, and wandering from the beaten track, until the trees gathering more thickly, made a shadow like night, come to a place where the leaves, descending to the very ground, formed an impenetrable barrier across your path—a wall of foliage and perfume? Impenetrable, and yet you pushed that wall aside, and stood in the shadow of an overhanging rock, from whose dark surface trickled a thousand little streams, uniting below, where the rock formed a basin, in a spring of cool, clear water, that lay like a mirror at your feet? Then, making a cup, with the broad leaf of the chesnut tree, you bent down, and drank the wine of the living rocks, this clear, cold water, fresh from the caverns of mother earth. Still, your dream is here! Or, wandering in the chambers of a mansion, that seemed deserted for ages—the ceiling veiled in cobwebs, the floors dark with dust, the tapestry eaten by moths—feel your heart grow cold, as your solitary footfall came back in a thousand echoes, and upstarting from some dark corner, a strange woman stood before you, her beautiful form clad in black velvet, her eyes darting their deep light into your soul? Still, here in the Wissahikon, you will find your dream! Or, once more,—you seemed loitering along the shades of the forest-path; you heard a voice, of vivid melody, thrilling like any forest-bird, its virgin song; and following the sweet sound, you suddenly beheld an angel form, stepping from the shelter of the trees, beautiful as Eve, before she fell, and gliding inch by inch, into the clear waves, her long hair floating over the ripples which dashed against her snow-white arms? Upon my word, your dream is here! But suddenly, this vision of a winter night became wildly changed. Blasts of organ-like music made by the winds howling through caverns broke awfully on your soul. Then the gust of a summer rain swept your cheek, every drop fragrant with perfume. You beheld the angel form of the young girl walk beside the dark woman, who led her to the verge of an awful cliff, smiling all the while, as she pushed the virgin toward the abyss. Flowers and skulls, perfumes and horrors, blasts from the grave, and breezes of May, were mingled in a strange—a grotesque panorama. And the last thing that you beheld, was a fair young face, sinking slowly into the waters of a fathomless abyss, her mild eye upraised, her soft voice whispering in prayer. With a cry of horror, you awoke, wondering—as the damps of fear started from your flesh—whether, in all the world, there had ever happened any history, so full of strong contrasts, so much light, so much blackness, as this, your dream of a winter night? Believe me, you will find the dream living bodily, and throbbing tumultuously, here in the Wissahikon! Come with me into its shadows? Leaving the dusty road, we behold the dark grey walls of an ancient mill, with a world of leaves behind it. Drowsily turns the heavy wheel, scattering drops of light from its gloomy timbers; sleepily trickles the water over beds of rocks; beautifully upon the mill and the rocks, the waters that are rushing there, and the leaves that accumulate yonder, glows the last smile of the setting sun. The mill is passed: behold a narrow path, leading away into the trees, its brown sand contrasted with the grass on either side. Yonder glooms a huge rock; we reach its foot, we see the trees towering far above us, clusters of foliage rising on clusters, until but a glimpse of the blue sky is seen. The walk is passed;—is it a dream that breaks upon us? Far, far away, extends a track of golden light, that shines until it fades. Look closer, and in that track of light, you discover the Wissahikon, sunken deep, between two walls of leaves and rocks that start upright from its very shores into the sky. And it flows silently on, receiving on its bosom that last gush of light, which pours above these heights from the western sky. Yonder, the leaves descend to its waters, and embrace it, as though they would bury it from the light, in a veil of foliage. The vines bend over it, and scatter their blossoms upon its waves. The very path seems to love it, for descending from these rugged steeps, it leads along the shore, only separated by a line of sand and flowers from its waters. The stream narrows, the trees almost meet from opposite sides, when suddenly this wild enchantress, the Indian maid, called Wissahikon, opens to us a prospect as strange as it is wildly beautiful. Stand with me, on this clump of green and shrubs, and behold it! Yonder, on the left, a wall of rocks rises, in gloomy grandeur into the sky. The waters gush upon their feet, the pines—see them far overhead—crown their brows. Black and dismal, rocks heaped on rocks, cliff starting over cliff, this wall towers above us, its dark surface, here and there, relieved by vines, or shadowed by trees, that grow between the clefts, their green branches shooting into light from every pile of granite. To the left, the woods ascend, in a rolling outline, like a wave of the ocean; only for ripples, you have leaves; for cheerless water, delicious foliage, wreathed with flowers. Directly in front, the narrow path leads up a steep hill. On the summit of that hill, a house of gray stone, encircled by a garden, a spring of cold water, gushing into an oaken trough, one solitary tree, bending over the steep roof, and rising, alone—a pyramid of leaves—into the evening sky. The last ray of the sun is trembling on the top of that tree! Between the hill covered by the house of dark stone, and this gloomy wall of cliffs, comes the Wissahikon, chafed into a rage by the rocks spread in her way, and writhing, on every wave, into a white foam, that looks like spring blossoms agitated by the wind. She came leaping over the rocks, filling the wild dell with voice of her agony; but the moment these rocks are past, she is calm again—she subsides into a gentle lake—she lovingly kisses the feet of the cliff, whispers in those caverns, and ripples her blessing to the flowers on yonder isle! We ascend the hill, and lingering on its summit, taste the waters of the spring, as we gaze for the last time upon the setting sun. Then, into the shadows, along the wood that darkens, until we stand upon the rock, with the Wissahikon far beneath our feet. Look down! Rushing from the north, her course is stayed by this dense mass of earth and trees and rocks. With a sudden movement, she wheels directly to the west, and hurries smilingly on. Look down! How calm, how like the sinless sleep of Eve in Paradise, that water smiles as it rests in the embrace of its beloved trees! Here the bank is steep and precipitous; yonder the woods shelve down into a level point of land, which projects into the clear waves. So dense is the shade cast by the overhanging trees upon the dark, rich earth, that but a few scattered clumps of grass and flowers overspread its surface.— Look down! Around that point, beneath the trees that stretch out their arms as if they loved it, the Wissahikon ripples, smiles, and glides on without a sound. Look down, but do not let your gaze wander too long upon the clear deep waters. For there is a strange fascination in those waves that wiles you to their embrace, and makes you wish to bury life and its troubles among their ripples. To yonder rock, where the dark waters spread into a limpid sheet, not deeper than your ankle, at dead of night, when the moon shone out over the trees, there came a young girl, who silently bared her form, and laid herself to rest, upon the pebbled bed, with the cool waters dashing over her bosom. The night passed, and she slept on. The morning came, and they found her there, with her head rising and falling with the gentle motion of the stream, her brown hair floating in the ripples, her white bosom now covered by the waves, now laid bare to the light. She slept well, upon the pebbled bed, rocked by the waters. No stain was on her name, no grief upon her heart. The aged man, her father, who lifted the corse from its watery cradle, could not impute to her one guilty thought. Her attire was found upon yon rock; her Bible and prayer book on the grass beside the stream. She had toiled three weary miles to die upon the bosom of the stream she loved so well. And when the old man laid her on the bank, there was a sad, sweet smile upon her face, as though some good angel had kissed her in her closing hour, and left a blessing on her lips. Along the northern path, with the stream roaring below us, we will hurry on. A beautiful picture! That cluster of old cottages and barns, grouped beside the mill, with rocks frowning above, and a sea of foliage, swelling into the sky. In that cottage, Rittenhouse, the Philosopher was born; between yonder rock and the buttonwood tree lies the space of earth which witnessed one of the darkest tragedies that ever froze the blood but to hear told again.* * See the Legend of the Parricide, page 98, of “Washington and his Generals,” by George Lippard. The blood of a father poured forth by the son, moistened that grassy sod. 1* Beside the mill, a mass of rocks chokes the course of Wissahikon. Above the wall of rocks, extending from the mill-wheel to the opposite shore, how calmly it glides on, its bosom shadowed by the trees that meet above its waveless waters! Below how it darkens, and boils, and foams, filling the air with its shout! Let us enter the light canoe, and while the oar makes low music to the ripples, glide softly on! Behind us pass the trees, still there are new groups ahead! Behind us bloom the flowers, still new blossoms greet us as we go! Behind us flashes the ripples, still before our canoe the stream extends, with foliage rising to the sky on either side. At last emerging from the thick shadow, we beheld a mound-like hill, covered by a strange edifice, built of stone, with steep roofs and many windows, and a garden blooming far down into the glen. That is the Monastery, in which the Monks of Wissahikon, long ago, worshipped their God, without a creed. In this space, between the mill which we have left and the Monastery which rises before us, on the eastern banks of Wissahikon, behold a quiet cottage, smiling from among the forest trees. It is built in the space between two colossal rocks; above it, far, far into the sky towers that wall of leaves; from its narrow door to the water's edge, a plot of level earth extends, green with moss and blooming with flowers. Even as an altar, on which the dearest hopes and fondest memories blossom, so from the forest out upon the waters, looks that Cottage Home of Wissahikon. This was on the third of July, 1776. Now, the rocks are clad with wild vines; the garden is a waste. Yet, searching among those vines, you may still discover the traces of a wall, the scattered stones and broken roof tile of that forest home! And the story of that home, the strange Legend of the wild Rose that bloomed there, which leads us into scenes of absorbing interest, now unveiling to our gaze, the Hall of Independence, crowded with the shadows of the past, now treading these shades and dells of Wissahikon, shall be inscribed with a name worthy of the purest page that ever kindled a generous emotion in the heart, or raised the soul with words of holy truth— TO * * * * THIS STORY OF THE PAST IS DEDICATED.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER FIRST. OLD MICHAEL, THE HUNTER. A hale old man, leaning on his rifle, with an iron frame, a bronzed visage, and snow-white hair! It was in the midst of the forest, where a huge oak tree, torn up by the roots, lay prostrate on the sward, the brown earth yet fresh about its trunk, its leaves still blooming in summer green. He stands before us, that old man, an effective picture of a bold backwoodsman; his broad chest and muscular arms displayed in their firm outlines by the folds of his blue hunting shirt, his limbs encased in buckskin leggings, moccasins on his feet, and a fur cap, green with a solitary oaken sprig, resting on his brow. The rifle on which he leans, long and dark and marked with scars, betrays the indications of thirty years' toil in the woods, and danger on the mountain path. Strung over his broad chest, a belt of dark leather sustains his shot pouch and powder horn. In the broad girdle,—a wampum belt, inscribed with the language of the red man— which encircles his waist, gathering in its confines the loose folds of his hunting shirt, a knife is placed, its handle of bone contrasting with the long and glittering blade. His face impresses you at once with a picture of green old age. Bronzed by the winter wind and the summer sun, marked with the traces of many a deadly conflict, the hair blanched into snow by the touch of seventy years, it displays a prominent nose, a broad chin, high cheek bones, and a firm mouth, encircled by heavy wrinkles. Indeed, the whole visage is traversed by wrinkles that resemble threads of iron, in their strongly marked outlines. From the shadow of his thick grey eyebrows, the gleam of two clear eyes, undimmed by the frost of age, now blue, now grey in their liquid breaks gently on you. Gently, and yet there are times when the light of those eyes remind you of a panther at bay, his blazing orbs glaring from the darkness of a cavern. And the old man, this hermit of the woods, who speaks a plainer speech with his rifles than with his tongue, stands before us, on the sward; the leaves spreading a waving roof above him, the evening solitude of the woods extending on every side. He lifts his cap—fashioned of the wild beasts' hide—and that solitary ray of sunlight wandering through the foliage, streams upon his white hair. By his side, reclining on the trunk of the prostrate oak, you behold a form whose every outline is strongly contrasted with the figure of the old backwoodsman. It is a young man in the vigor of early manhood. His form, well-knit and muscular, yet delicate almost to womanly beauty, in its graceful outline, is attired in a costume of dark velvet—a coat reaching half-way to the knee, and girded to the waist by a belt of leather—boots of the same hue encase his limbs, and a white collar thrown open at the neck, displays the chiselled outline of his throat. Yet it is not upon the dark attire enveloping his agile form that you gaze, nor upon his beautiful rifle, whose dark tube is relieved by the mahogany stock, mounted in silver, nor does the powder horn, inlaid with golden flowers, nor the hunting knife, with its carved ivory handle attract your eye. It is that face, with the black hair falling back from its brow along the neck, from under the wide shadow of a slouching hat; it is that eye that seems to burn with light, as it rests upon you; it is that olive cheek now reddening with emotion, now pale as marble; it is that mouth, which wreathes in a smile, or curves in scorn, which now speaks in low tones, where music wins you, and again, utters its deep voice, that indicates a soul conscious of power! It is upon that face, moulded, not with the regularity of an ancient statue, but with firm and characteristic outlines; the face framed in the shadow of the hat of dark felt, with low crown and drooping brim, that you gaze, in the quiet evening hour. One limb crossed over the other, the right arm resting on the trunk of the fallen tree, the head downcast, and the dark eyes fixed upon the sward, the young man seemed absorbed in thought, while the old hunter stood erect by his side. After a pause that lasted some five minutes, the old man turned and gazed upon his young comrade. “It's queer—reg'lar queer!” he said, with a slight laugh, and then paused as if waiting for an answer. The young man was silent. “I say it's queer—it's particular strange—I mought say ridiculous! To think that you and I have been out in the woods, time off and on, for six months back, and yet neither of us knows where the tother lives, nor even his name!” “What need of a name?” said the young man, without raising his eyes from the ground—“we met last winter, among the wilds of the Susquehanna. We hunted together, shared the same rude meal, after our day's toil, and at night slept side by side, on a bed of withered leaves. You called me Walter—I called you Michael. What need of other names? We met and were friends!” Walter played listlessly with the handle of his knife, as he spoke. Still his eyes were fixed upon the sod “But Walter, don't you know yer voice betrays you?— Yer speech is not the speech of the backwoodsman, but the talk of the city and the village. Yer rifle and knife, aye yer dress itself, don't speak much for yer poverty. Yer hands are too white, yer skin too fair, to fancy for a minute that you've lived long in the woods. But, howsomever it is, I can't tell, but I like you, and have liked ye, since the day—” “When, away yonder on the Susquehanna, my rifle missed fire, and the panther sprang at my throat. Your aim was good, your eye true, or I should have been a dead man. Michael, you saved my life, and there's my hand!” The old hunter extended his horny palm, and grasped the delicate fingers of his young comrade, with an iron clutch. “A month ago we parted at least an hundred miles from this—to-day we meet again, here in the woods of Wissahikon—” Walter raised his full dark eyes. A strange smile passed over his face. “It would be interesting for us to compare our history for the past month,” he said. “This is a quiet hour. The evening air is cool, delicious. These old woods make a man feel on better terms with himself and the world. And the sound of the waters, lulling gently on the ear, seem like the voices of other days, telling of the joys, the sorrows, that are past and gone. Come, Michael, begin—tell us the history of your life for the past thirty days.” The young man started, as he witnessed the strange effect of his words. Michael stood before him trembling, as with an ague chill, his sunburnt face, writhing in every chord, while his eyes blazed with that panther glare, which made the heart beat quicker to behold. “Tell you the history of the past month?” he said, in a voice and with a manner entirely different from his usual rough, backwoodsman way. “There are some things, young man, that draw the knife from the belt, and raise the rifle to the shoulder. Things that it wont do to talk about, not even in a whisper! Deeds, aye, I say it, deeds that make the blood run cold. But,” and he advanced a step, while that light blazed more fiercely from his eye, “what do you know of my history for the past month?” The young man started to his feet. He extended his hands— “Nothing, Michael—not a word, not even a whisper,” he said, examining the face of the old man with a searching glance. “I meant not to rouse one bitter memory in your heart. Come, sit down by me; I will,” and that strange smile passed over his face—“I will tell you the story of my life for the past thirty days.” The old man did not reply, but, taking the young man's hand within his own, he led him for some few paces along the woods. “Look thar!” he said, in his usual rough voice, “thar is my home!” Far down the woods, through a vista that extended among the trunks of massive trees, the young man looked and saw a quiet cottage with a garden, blooming from its door to the verge of a calm, unruffled glimpse of water. The woods, through which he gazed, were wrapt in thick shadow; but the roof of that cottage, resting between two rocks, gleamed brightly in the setting sun. Above it swelled the sea of forest leaves, below sparkled the still Wissahikon—it was like a picture framed in waving leaves and glancing waters. “Thar 's my home!” “Your home!” echoed Walter, hiding his face in his hands, and turning away from the old man, while he shook with emotion. Michael gazed upon him with unfeigned surprise. “And ain't it a purty home? Did you ever see a nicer bit of happiness hid away in the woods than that? O, if you could but see the angel that dwells thar with me, and keeps house when I am out among the woods, and puts her soft hands on my forehead, when the—aye, I must speak it, —when the dark hour comes on me; if you could but see her and know her, you would worship her!” Walter raised his face. All traces of emotion had vanished, but he was very pale and his eyes shone with peculiar lustre. “That's your home!” he calmly said, “what a beautiful home it!” “Perhaps he has his memories, too!” the old hunter muttered, “God knows!” The young man took his hand, and whispered, “Michael, look yonder!” Michael gazed far down that vista, among the huge forest trees, and with hushed breath beheld a sight as strange as it was beautiful. From the door of that cottage home came forth a young girl clad in a peasant garb—a light boddice, fitting close to her bosom, a dark skirt, flowing to her feet—with her brown hair, blowing lightly about her face in the evening breeze. She tripped along the garden, and stood by the water's edge. Her eyes were cast down the stream, her bending form assumed an attitude of anxious expectation. Presently, gliding from the trees, a light canoe broke into view, and in it stood erect the form of a woman, attired in a dark robe, with her face glowing in the warm light of the fading day. She leapt lightly on the shore—the young girl seemed to start with surprise, but this woman in the dark attire seized her hands and urged her gently into the cottage. They disappeared together, and the closing doors concealed them from the view. Had Michael and his young comrade beheld the scene, which then transpired within the cottage home, they would have felt their hearts beat quicker, their blood bound, like liquid fire, through their veins! But they did not witness that scene; they only saw the young girl, and the dark-robed woman, go in the cottage door together. For a moment Michael and his comrade stood in silence, gazing in each other's faces, as though spell-bound by that sight. “That's strange!” at last the old man said,—“Who the lady in the dark dress can be is more than I can tell! I never knew before that the child was acquainted with anybody in the world, save me! Ah, now I think of it, that visiter is the rich widow who resides in the large mansion on t'other side of Wissahikon! But how came she to know my child?” “She is your child?” cried Walter in a hurried tone— “your daughter?” “My Daughter? Hah! What do you mean? My Daughter?” You can see the old man's cheek assume the hue of ashes, his lip is livid and his eyes are fixed upon the ground. “Young man, you've touched the bitter chord agin! Don't you know it's better to cut one's heart with your knife, than to do it with a word?” “Pardon, Michael, pardon! I have known you hitherto but as a rough child of the forest. Now, that I behold in you the owner of this beautiful home, the father of this—” “Father?” hurriedly interrupted old Michael. “Who told you I was father to that angel girl? Sixteen years ago I brought her to that place, an innocent and smiling babe! Sixteen years ago I built that home! For sixteen years she has grown up in solitude, and every hour of those years grown deeper into my heart! Yes, it is sixteen years and one month, since that night.” Again the old man paused, his countenance betraying the traces of mental agony. While Walter, leaning his noble form against yonder tree, with his head downcast, gazed fixedly in the face of his comrade, you see that aged comrade clutch his rifle with quivering fingers, dash the stock into the earth, and then pace wildly to and fro. Again he spoke in that tone so different from his rough backwoodsman voice. He spoke not as much to Walter as to his own soul, not so much with the consciousness of a human eye, gazing upon his face, as the Eye of God reading his soul. “What—what have I not done to wash out the memory of that night! O, it was pitiful,—it was horrible! Satan himself could not have painted so dark a picture, nor planned so accursed a deed! A home in flames—two dead bodies thrown beside the hearth, a husband and his wife! Both young—one noble in his manly vigor, the other beautiful in her womanly purity! And beside the body of the dead husband a little boy stood weeping; over the cold bosom of the dead wife a baby crept, pressing its lips to that font which was dried forever! And the wretch who led on the midnight assassins, who leagued with red savages and white robbers, came, at dead of night, to lay this home in ashes, came with his face blackened, the torch in one hand, the knife in the other. Who was he? A fiend? No, a Brother!” He stood, with his outstretched hands, quivering in every finger, his eyes glaring in the sod. The white foam frothed about his livid lips. Walter stood appalled by the violence of the old man's emotion. You may behold him, leaning against yonder tree, his face manifesting in every outline surprise mingled with horror. “That house, blackened and in ruins, lies two hundred miles away in a green valley of the Alleghanies. It stands there as it has stood for years, a black witness of unnatural guilt. On its hearthstone the blood has never faded; from the walls the ghosts of the dead have never gone—no, not for an hour! And to that ruined house, once every year— in June, when the trees are in blossom, in June, when the murder was done—there comes the form of the murderer to gaze upon the traces of his crimes. For one month, day and night, he crouches down upon the hearthstone, gazing upon that mark of blood, that hideous blotch of red that glares in his face, as though it had a thousand eyes, all fired by the same curse! “For sixteen years, on the return of June, the murderer has been dragged by invisible bands over mountain and flood to that blasted house! For sixteen years he has been forced by voices that speak from the air, and speak to his heart, like the anathema of the archangel, to write a confession of his crime, and place it in the dead woman's grave! Sixteen confessions are there; sixteen records of that bloody deed!” His look was terrible, as towering erect, he shook his clenched hands in the air, while his eyes rolled and his mouth frothed around the writhing lips with scattered drops of foam and blood. “Who says that repentance can wash out crime? You may forsake the world, bury yourself from human eyes, throw wealth and rank to the winds, put on humble attire and pray all day in the woods, and groan all night in the desert where no eye but the eye of God can hear, and still the faces of the murdered will never cease to glare at you, and move their lips as though they would speak but could not! You may take the child from the breast of the mother, bear it away from the scene of crime, rear it up to womanhood in purity and virtue, and yet the child will one day learn your crime—that child will live to curse the man whom it has called father, and hiss in his ears the words: `Thou didst it on a dark night! Thou didst it when all was still! Thou didst it when husband and wife lay wrapt in each other's arms! Then thou didst murder my Mother!”' That frenzied voice sank into an accent of overwhelming agony. “To be cursed by her—to be cursed by—Rose!” You may have seen a huge rock, suddenly precipitated from an immense height upon the void below. Descending in a straight line, it strikes a lofty tree, and ere you can draw another breath, crushed it, from the top to the roots, into one mass of ruins. As though he had been that tree, as though the falling rock had, in its dread career, taken life and plunged upon his skull, the old man, Michael, rushed to the earth; so sudden was his fall, so stiffened and lifeless upon the sod he lay. Walter knelt beside him. He gazed upon the pale features and glassy eyeballs, in silence. The emotion which had but a moment ago shaken the old man's frame, seemed now to have passed into the veins of his comrade, for every feature of his face was in motion; with his hand pressed nervously against his forehead, he gazed into the countenance of the insensible man. The sun had gone down, and the shadows, cast by the trees, in long columns of darkness, began to grow wider and deeper. The forest was still as a deserted cathedral. Not the sound of distant water, nor the rustling of the wind among the trees, disturbed the brooding silence of the Wissahikon woods. And let me tell you, to be among those woods, when that silence so awfully spiritual pervades the air, while the foliage, spreading around, makes noonday seem like twilight, is to feel your soul grow nearer to the other world. Then, your heart feels sad, you know not why. Then, the memories of your past life, rush upon you. Then, through the long arcades and bowery glades, half-closing your eyes, you seem to behold the forms of beloved ones, long since dead, gliding slowly to and fro. Walter—this young man, whom we know by that name— with an eye, always gleaming brighter in the presence of danger; a heart, that throbbed tumultuously with passion, or fired with a love of the beautiful and holy; a soul, ever swayed by impulse, capable at once of the highest heroism and the purest self-denial, felt the influence of this evening hour. His thoughts were dark to agony! We dare not picture their nature; but, as he bent over the insensible man, he seemed to behold two faces, gliding along a twilight sky, with wreaths of mists about their clearly defined outlines. One, the face of a sinless girl, whose young face and tranquil eyes seemed to woo him from the world and its cares and fears, into these dear solitudes of Wissahikon. The love of that maiden face was stainless; the passion of those clear deep eyes undimned by the mists of sensual feeling. The other, the face of matured loveliness, with ambition gleaming from the dark eyes, the love of the world and the world's feverish joys burning in the vermillion glow of each olive cheek. That high brow, that dark hair, floating in showers of glossy blackness over the half-bared bosom, that red lip, curling with scorn, or parting with passion, completed the picture of this strange, yes—the terrible face. “One woos me to the shadows of the quiet woods, and asks of me a love as virgin as these solitudes! The other plunges me into the tumults of the world, bids me grapple with the weapons of ambition, and share the throbbings of a love that beats with the madness of fever and wine! His daughter! She, so proud, so distant, whom I have only seen afar off, and by glimpses; she seeks the presence of the peasant maid! What can it portend?” As he kneels there, absorbed in his thoughts, a singular incident occurs. Do you see that strange form, with long and matted hair descending to the broad shoulders, and folds of crape veiling the face, move noiselessly from tree to tree? As you look, it crouches on the ground—and crawls, snake-like, along the sod;—it reaches the fallen trunk, against which the silver-mounted rifle leans. Beware, Walter, for there is treachery in the soundless movements of that uncouth shape! But he does not see it; no, he does not behold his rifle grasped by those brawny hands, the pan unclosed, and the priming blown from beneath the flint. In a moment the rifle is replaced, and the form of this unknown enemy moves noiselessly away. Still Walter knelt beside the insensible man; still the vision of those two faces occupied his soul. As his thoughts thus rose in singular confusion to his lips, he was roused from his reverie by a distant sound, resembling the cry of fear or agony. It rose, it swelled, it came through the silence of the woods like the voice of a spirit. Walter felt a shudder pervade his frame. There was something almost supernatural in this sudden cry, breaking so abruptly on the death-like silence of the woods. He started to his feet, and grasped his rifle! Again that cry! With a bound he hurried up the ascent of the steep, covered by those huge old forest trees. That cry seemed ringing like a knell of death in his ears. The trees, the rocks, a long slope of level sward, flew behind him; and his course was presently interrupted by the boughs of a beechen tree, which, descending to the very sod, formed a wall of green leaves across his path. Again that cry! Not ten feet distant it was heard. Walter plunged through the foliage of the beechen tree, and started back, with a sudden bound, as he beheld a spectacle that made his heart beat as with pulsations of flame. A beautiful woman, kneeling on the sod, her bosom bared, her long hair falling to her shoulders, with hands and eyes upraised, in a trembling gesture of prayer! Above her—standing with his back to the sun—you see the figure of a thick-set and muscular man, who lifts a rifle above the head of the kneeling woman. As he turns toward the light, you see his face, covered with folds of crape, while from beneath his rough cap of fur long locks of draggled hair wave in the light. Altogether, as he stands there, he looks the bravo and outcast, fitted by a dark experience for any deed of crime. “Your gold;—come, no delay! Them ear-rings, and that jewel on yer bosom! Come, I say!” The rifle, grasped by the barrel, like a huge club, rose above the kneeling woman's head. At this moment, Walter sprang from the foliage, and confronted the ruffian. “Back!” he cried, and levelled his rifle. The Outcast only rested the stock of his rifle on the sod, and a low laugh came from the folds of crape which enveloped his face. “Fire!” he said, with that low, growling sound of laughter. From yon aperture among the trees, the last glow of the western sky gives a purple light to the scene. You see that craped face, framed in its bushy locks of hair, that thick-set form, with the right arm wound around the barrel of the rifle. Walter starting forward, his rifle raised to his eye, his manly form disclosed in all its delicacy of outline by the dress of dark velvet, relieved by the green of the trees. Between these figures, the form of the kneeling woman, her beautiful countenance pale with suspense, her bared bosom throbbing with quivering emotion. In the tranquil light of this still hour, her dark hair, showering so freely over the white shoulders, assumed the purple tint of the twilight. “Fire!” cried the Outcast; and again that laugh broke on the air. Walter applied his finger to the trigger—there was a harsh, jarring sound, but no flash in the pan—no report from the tube. “Ha, ha, ha! That for your rifle!” And, with the celerity of a lightning flash, he seized the jewelled chain from the neck of the lady, and stood erect, calmly leaning on his rifle. Walter, at a moment's glance, saw that he must prepare for a desperate conflict. Dashing his rifle on the sod, he drew his hunting-knife, and advanced upon the bravo. “Come,” he growled, “I'll tame your blood!” and, without moving an inch from his position, seemed about to spring on his antagonist, like a rattlesnake on the unsuspecting victim. He raised his arm to strike that unknown man, but the kneeling woman bounded from the sod, flung her arms about his neck. “Save me!” she cried, and lay fainting on his breast. Her long hair streaming over his face, for a moment blinded his vision; with a sudden movement, he swept aside those silken tresses. The bravo, the Outcast was gone! But there, in the arms of Walter, the hunter, in this deep evening hour, lay the form of a beautiful woman, whose matured loveliness was enveloped in a close-fitting habit; whose bosom, lately heaving with emotion, now lay white and pulseless beneath his gaze; whose arms, round and full, were wound about his neck, while her dark hair streamed in glossy masses over his shoulders. A wildly beautiful woman; a voluptuous organization; a face, rich olive in hue, with the lids closed and the lashes resting on the cheek, displaying in its calm forehead, marked brows, and firm lips, the traces of a bold and ambitious nature! “It is the vision which for a month past has, day after day, flitted across my gaze, from the far distance!” he said, and felt his temple burn, his veins swell as with liquid flame. Wishing to gaze yet more clearly on that beautiful face, he turned toward the western sky. As he turns—but no! it is a fancy, a dream!—the fainting woman uncloses her eyes, while a smile of triumph wreaths her proud lips. It is for a moment only. When Walter looks again, the lips are smileless, the eyes closed as if in death. Walter gazed, for a few moments, upon that face motionless as marble, while his very soul seemed lost in the vortex of a whirlpool. His eyes swam, his temples throbbed, he could feel his heart beat against his bosom. At last a soft flush pervaded her olive cheek; her lids were slowly raised, the full blaze of her dark eyes rested upon Walter's face. With a bound, she sprang from his arms; even in the dim shadowy light of that hour, Walter beheld the rich blushes ripen over her face and bosom. `Thanks, good sir,—you have saved, perchance, my life,” she said, in her musical voice, yet with a manner of calm dignity. Walter beheld her standing in the centre of that forest bower, and as the light of her eyes, the expression of her commanding face, dawned upon him, through the gathering gloom, he started with surprise. For a month or more, this strange woman, seen through the vistas of the forest from afar, had filled him with a bewildering interest. Now he beheld her face he felt the light of those eyes which flashed with all the consciousness of intellectual and voluptuous power. “Lady Marion!” he exclaimed. “We have met before! In the Court of St. James, surrounded by a circle of admirers, glittering with stars and coronets, I last beheld you. Now, in this lone forest—” “Ah! I remember well your face, though I never knew you to converse with you. Your name was whispered among the courtiers—indeed, the King himself stated that wealth and chivalry had not often found a nobler representative than Reginald—” “No names, lady!” And Walter bowed low as he spoke. “In the forest, ha, ha! we are but plain men and woman, you will be pleased to remember!” “Did you not first set the example? `Lady Marion,' indeed! Doubtless you wonder to find me here, in this wild place. I frankly confess that you are the last person I should have expected to behold—shall I say hoped?—here in the woods of the Wissahikon!” She advanced, and, with that smile playing over her face —oh! you should have seen its strange, mysterious fascination!—she lightly laid her hand upon his arm. Walter started, for her touch penetrated his veins like electric fire. “Would you know my mission, in these dark, wild woods? Would you solve the mysteries, not only of a poor, weak woman's life, but of government and war—would you achieve the freedom of your native land—the deliverance of the soil from the clouds which overshadow it? Come, then, to-night, at the hour of ten, to yonder house, on the opposite shore of Wissahikon!” “I will!” said Walter, scarce knowing what he spoke. There was the sound of a heavy footstep, and Michael— whom we left insensible upon the sod—advanced from the shelter of the leaves. “Brave soldier, I have sought for you, through the woods, and your home!” cried Lady Marion, confronting the aged hunter, who stood surprised at her address, and yet impressed, he scarce knew why, by the sound of that low musical voice. “You fought in Braddock's war, under Washington? “I did!” “You would serve Washington? Rescue him from the perils that beset him; from the plots of his enemies?” “With my life!” And the old hunter brought his rifle down on the sod, by way of emphasis. “Come with me, then, to my mansion on yonder hill!— These are strange times, when a woman must forget the modesty of her sex, in the service of her country; when the old man must feel his withered arm grow strong again, to defend that country! Come!” Even the old hunter, whom we have lately seen writhing in convulsions—the fierce struggle of bodily or mental disease—felt the magic of that woman's look and voice. “I'm with you!” he said; “Washington! Is he in danger? I saw the bullets rattle against the blade of his sword, on the day of Braddock's defeat—I'll try to keep them from his heart, now that his enemies encompass him! But first, young man”—he turned to Walter, and whispered in his ear —“You saw me in that fit,—just now? Eh, comrade? Notice anything particular? I'm apt to say queer things—you overheard, we—” He paused, while his eyes flashed deadly light; he paused, hesitated, as though he wished Walter to complete the sentence. “Pardon me, Michael, if I left you for an instant!” the young man answered, in an even voice, and with a composed manner—“This lady was in danger, or I would not have forsaken you, in such a moment.” “So you overheard nothing, eh? But come, Walter, I like you, and have liked you, ever since the day when I saved your life. I have a daughter—you understand an old man's feelings. I may die suddenly, some day; be picked off by a bullet, or fall from a cliff. This child must not be left to the mercy of a heartless world! Join hands with me, and swear before the God who sees and will judge— swear to protect my child!” Walter turned his face away from the faint glow of light which shone from the western sky, and extended his hand. “Your hand trembles!” whispered the old hunter. “Still, I swear!” “You swear to protect my child, even Rose, not only from the touch of harm, but from the wiles of the seducer, the arts of the libertine! Ah! why does your hand shrink from my grasp? Why do you turn away? Can it be, that I have been mistaken in you? Are you afraid to act the part of a brother to the young and helpless girl?” Walter stood in the shadows, his face buried in his hands. Well for him that it was so dark, that forest bower! Well for him that the keen eye of the old man could not read the agony of his face! But the woman who stands in the background, her bosom 2 swelling beneath her robe, her finger to her lip, her eyes glancing triumphant fire—what means her agitation? “I have been mistaken—you are not a man of courage!” said the old man, turning away. Walter sprang forward and grasped his hand. “Pardon me! It was but a bitter memory of a sad story I once heard, that caused this apparent reluctance! Your hand! I swear to protect your daughter—even Rose—from the touch of harm, from the wiles of the seducer, the arts of the libertine!” And while the old man grasped the hand of this unknown comrade, whom we have heard addressed by the names of Walter and Reginald, there, half buried in the shadows, stood the Lady Marion, her face overspread with smiles, the light of a strange passion flashing from her eyes!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER SECOND. ROSE. The moon, rising over yonder precipitous ascent of woods, shines down upon the cottage home of Michael, the hunter. So, perchance, a thousand years ago she shone, when these trees encircled mansions of marble; when the banners of a strange and forgotten people fluttered in a summer air, as bland as the breeze which now makes music among the leaves; when, beside these waters, grouped the Priests and the white-robed maidens, swelling into the deep vault of heaven, their sacrificial song! Walter advanced from the shadows of the trees, and stood upon a rock that towers there at this hour; his dark attire and pale face, disclosed in the light of the rising moon.— You see his face upraised, its pale hue giving unnatural radiance to his clear dark eye; you perceive the traces of tears upon that bold cheek, and yet the resolve of a strong will speaks in that firm mouth and rounded chin. It was a very beautiful sight that he saw, by the pale light of the moon. Not a palace of white marble, nor yet one of those red brick mansions which freeze the soul out of you, with their bright pink walls and green window-shutters; but a little structure of wood and stone, nestling between two huge rocks. How the vines waved and the flowers bloomed upon those gray old piles of granite! It was but a little structure, with a single window, and a steep roof, that sheltered from the sun and rain three little rooms; but, for all that, it was a “home.” A home, with trees on trees around, above it; a home, with a still stream flowing gently by; a home, with a garden spreading from its door down to the water's edge; a home, with roof of boards and straw, hidden by leaves and fragrant with honeysuckles; a home, containing a treasure more precious than the gold of Mexico, or the diamonds of Hindoostan! That treasure—an immortal soul—locked up within the body of a beautiful and sinless girl! Walter stood gazing upon it, wrapped in his thoughts, when a footstep resounded by his side. He turned, and beheld the form of a negro, his white eyeballs and ivory teeth shining rfrom a face black as ink and glossy as silk. He stood the e, six feet high in his boots, his broad chest enveloped in a green coat, faced with gold; his thick wool surmounted bya cap of dark fur; his limbs encased in long boots, that shone like mirrors. Altogether, he was as fine a specimen of the African, with his flat nose, big lips, and protruding eyes, as you might see in any court of justice, on the occasion of the trial of a fugitive slave. It may also be remarked, that the muzzles of two silver-mounted pistols protruded from the breast of his dark green coat. “I is here, Massa!” said the dark gentleman, with a bow that would have done honor to a courtier of Versailles. “Ah! is that you, Bram?” “It am de rale nigga, Massa!” “Is everything ready? You remember my orders? First, the Purple Chamber, in my city mansion, was to be prepared for my reception;—have you obeyed my commands?” “Y-e-s, Massa!” “At twelve o'clock to-night, the carriage is to be waiting, in the narrow lane, beyond the Wissahikon, about half a mile from this place.” “It will be dar!” “Bram, you must not express any surprise in case a young gentleman, somewhat slender in form, and clad in a plain dark dress, should appear at twelve to-night, and enter the carriage! The moment he enters, you will drive with all speed to the city, and lead this young gentleman up stairs into the Purple Chamber.” “Dis nigga nebbaw fails to do dat which Massa commands. No, he does not, dat he don't!” “The young gentleman will be known to you, not so much by his dress, as by the white scarf which binds his eyes—” “De grashus goodness! Blinefold, eh? Bress a poor darkey's stars! Dat reminds me of Paris. A berry fine place is Paris, only dem folks do talk so pertiklar queer. And den dey aint got no common sense! Laws! dey treats a dark brown colored gemman just like a white person, widout de 'propriate distinction ob color!” “You have heard my commands. Remember, the happiness—perchance, the life—of your master depends upon the manner in which you follow them. Do!” Without a word the liveried negro disappeared, and was lost to view among the trees. We will now watch the movements of Walter with peculiar interest. Descending from the rock, he draws forth from among the bushes, which dip from the bank into the waves, an Indian canoe, hewn by the hands of old Michael from the trunk of a massive tree. You see him enter the canoe; he stands erect, in the light of the moon, his pale face betraying unequivocal signs of emotion. One movement of the slender oar, and the fragile barge glides noiselessly over the waters, and rests beside the opposite shore. Walter leaps upon the bank. He stands in the garden, which blooms along the level space. He listens! All is still; the clear moonlight falls upon the latticed window of the cottage, but reveals no traces of the presence of any human thing within its walls. He advances toward the door, his heart beating quicker, his strong frame trembling in every nerve. Still no sound! His hand is upon the wooden latch—for a moment he pauses in painful suspense—he crosses the threshold of that home. All is silent there. Through the small window, a belt of moonlight falls along the outer floor All beside is dark. Through that darkened room, Walter moves with noiseless footsteps and extended hands. A sob, low and gushing, as if arising from the heart, disturbs the silence. At the same moment, his hand touches a woman's cheek, and feels her tears. “Rose!” All is dark; he cannot see her, yet a small hand is laid within his own, and a face is pressed against his bosom. “You are unhappy! You weep—” There was no reply; none in words, yet the hand that was pressed within his own—the young face, resting on his bosom—spoke that universal language which Love first learned in Paradise. In a moment, Walter gently disengaged her arm from his neck, hurried into the next chamber, and returned, bearing a light in his hands. Then it might be seen that the Rose of Wissahikon was transcendantly beautiful! She bloomed in one corner of the small room, her form resting upon a huge old arm-chair, fashioned of solid oak. Her cheek upon her hand; her eyes upraised, she shone through the ehamber like an angel presence. You would pardon this extravagance of speech, had you but for a moment seen her in her virgin beauty. True, the dress which enveloped her young form, was of the plainest and coarsest material; true, her foot was encased in a rude shoe, made of rough buckskin; true, her bosom was veiled by a plain white kerchief, and yet, for all her simple dress, her beauty shone out and lighted that small chamber of the forest home. That foot, seen below the coarse skirt, was so small; that bosom, heaving beneath the white kerchief, so round and full; those arms, bare from the shoulder, so like arms of alabaster, rounded by the chisel of an inspired sculptor, veined by delicate threads of azure, softened by a flush like the first glow of a summer morn; that face, so fair in its hue, so warm in the lips, so brilliant in the eyes, so beautifully relieved by the rich mass of dark brown hair! Her eyes were neither blue, nor hazel, nor black. Now dark, now bright, now slowly lighting up with emotion; now flashing into sudden radiance; now gleaming dimly through the half-closed lips; now overspread with moisture, —even as the stars look more beautiful through the tears of an April shower; those eyes, always in every phase of expression, sent their rays home to the heart! The hair was brown, and yet, in one light, it was black as the deep vault of a midnight sky; in another, purple as the last kiss of day upon the western horizon. The word auburn, expressing that delicious combination of colors which imparts such divine beauty to the hair of a lovely woman, comes nearer the truth. Her eyes full of clear, deep light; her skin white as marble, with the young blood speaking out in each cheek; her hair auburn in hue and plainly gathered back from her face—just as the painters have pictured our Mother Mary, so bloomed this young girl in that cottage chamber. Her hair was bound in a coil at the back of her head, and yet the band, which clasped it, once untied, it covered her —the neck, the bosom and the form, which would have been voluptuous, had not the eyes been so pure—it covered her like a veil, that beautiful flowing hair. Walter stood on the threshold, surveying in silent admiration this lovely girl. The same light that reveals his form, clad in a hunting garb of dark velvet, shines upon the young maiden with the light kerchief around her neck, the dark skirt upon her form. Her eyes, dim with tears, encountered his earnest gaze. Shall we translate the thought which gave such a deep melancholy to his face?” “A miracle! This young and beautiful girl reared alone in these woods from her earliest infancy! her only companion an old man, who is now rough as any forester in his speech, and again in the very writhings of remorse betrays the eloquence of the forum, the refinement of courtly life! Reared alone—a beautiful flower blooming in the desert— the light of genius shines from the eyes, the glow of education warms her face. That hand can fill the canvass with flowers and forms as beautiful as those seen in a midsummer dream—or pour forth, on paper, thoughts that indicate at once the tenderness of woman, the power of genius! And yet she knows the world from books alone—its cares, its customs are to her but the dim phantoms of a day-break dream.” So ran his thoughts, but before him ever rose one question that poisoned the serenity of his soul:—“Is yours the hand to tear from the vase, in which it blooms, this flower, so pure, so virgin? Is your's the heart to plan the shame of that chaste being, the dishonor of that maiden soul?” “Rose,” he said aloud, advancing to the maiden, “to-night you will leave your home. All is arranged. To-night you will link your fate with mine! Why do you weep? Is it because you dread the coming of that hour, when gathering you to my heart, I shall whisper: `Rose, you are mine!”' She slowly arose from the chair, and laid her hands upon his arms. “But a month since we met, and I am about to leave father and home for you! Only a few short weeks ago I beheld you, for the first time, standing at the banks of the Wissahikon, and now, for you, Arthur—for you, I am about to leave this dear home for ever!” The language, which spoke from her upraised eyes, was an hundred times more powerful than her words. Walter, Reginald, Arthur! At all events, the young hunter is rich in names. “But the Home, to which I will lead you, Rose—” “A cottage like this, in a dear, secluded valley, Arthur, with such green woods above us, such a quiet stream rippling by the door! Say, is't not so, Arthur? You wish a home like this? There we will dwell together, and after your day's toil in the woods—for you are but a poor hunter, Arthur—we will sit together by the fireside of home, our faces glowing in the same hallowed light!” Arthur smiled, perchance, at the earnestness of her eyes, the simple pathos of her voice. “The Purple Chamber!” he murmured, and bent his eyes upoe her glowing face. “But my father, Arthur! he will come and visit us. Ah, why must we meet without his knowledge—why this secresy? This mystery?” She buried her face upon his breast, and as he looked down upon her glossy tresses, a dark and ominous frown gathered upon his brow. Ah, Walter, Reginald, Arthur, what means that frown? Does the thought of your secret meetings, for this month past—that history which you were about to tell old Michael, the hunter,—cross your soul? And now, old Michael, and the father of this girl are ONE, and you dare not breathe the knowledge of this fact to the maid, who throbs upon your bosom, her heart pulsating with a holy, a virgin love?” Remember your Oath! “But why need we leave Wissahikon?” she cried with a radiant smile upon her face; “Why leave this place, where the dawn is so lovely, the noon-day so serene, the twilight so holy? Not a path, in these dear woods, but we have trod together—I clad in the hunter's dress, which you brought me—while you, with your rifle to your shoulder, pointed out each beautiful view; here, a delightful glimpse of water; there, a cool cascade dashing over grey rocks, or, far away, the Wissahikon, shining light a golden track of light in the setting sun! And those beautiful bowers in the forest, Arthur, where there are vines blooming with honeysuckles, and lilies wreathing their white cups with the leaves of the rose, and the air breathe perfume, and the lull of the distant stream comes on the ear like sweet music from Heaven! O, I have passed such happy years in this dear solitude— my father so kind, so good! Yes, kind, for all he leaves me alone for a month, every year; good, for all that he mutters to himself and writhes in agony in the long hours of the nigt, and wanders out in the storm, his head and breast bared to the blast! And we must leave it all, Arthur, to-night, we must say to all that is beautiful here, Farewell!” She stood in her blushing beauty before her lover, in that plain room. The sanded floor; the white-washed walls, adorned with the works of her pencil; the grotesquely carved table, on which her books—her Bible among the rest—were placed; the hearth, now wreathed with roses and laurel; the low ceiling, supported by heavy rafters— such were the details of the picture. In the centre stood the tall form of the lover, his dark dress imparting additional paleness to his face; his right arm holding the light above his head, and before him her eyes upraised, her heart beating warmly beneath her kerchief, the young girl blushed like a rose, trembling on its stem to a gentle breeze. “Do you love me?” he said, bending upon her face the full light of his eyes. You should have seen her clear skin slowly ripening from her bosom to the brow, from the shoulders to the fingers, in all the crimson of her virgin blood! What woman ever lived, who could hear without a quivering pulse those words spoken by dark eyes, burning with light, at the same instant that are spoken by a voice that trembles between a whisper and a sigh, those words: Do you love me? Poor Rose! Just as you have seen a humming bird beat its rainbow wings against the scarf, that lightly enveloped it, so her heart beat in her bosom, imparting its fire to her cheek and eyes! How it was she knew not, but she seemed to grow toward her lover's form, her head sought his shoulder as a pillow, the band that tied her hair parted, and down it fell, that flowing hair, down it streamed, so glossy and so beautiful in its hues, now brown, now black, now purple, that waving auburn hair. And then as the lids of her eyes half closed, her lips parted until her white teeth were seen—a line of ivory, set in vermilion! Arthur bent gently down, and, for the first time, suffered his breath to mingle with hers, as their lips throbbed together and mingle in that signet of a deathless love! The first kiss! “To-night, at twelve, remember!” he said—not in a calm, even voice, you may be sure. “To-night, in your hunter's dress, at twelve, remember!” and hurried from the room. When she came to the door, she beheld him standing on the opposite shore, the summer moon pouring its rays upon his uncovered brow. Between them rippled the stream— around and above fluttered the sea of leaves, and from afar came the plaintive song of the whippoor-will. He stood on the very rock, where she first beheld him a month gone by. He flung a kiss to her as she stood in the cottage door; a warm picture in a rude frame. Again that word, “Remember!” and he was gone. Rose looked upon the vacant rock for many minutes, and then entered her home, closing the door. In fifteen minutes there came from the cottage door a young hunter, clad in a dress which was at once singularly neat and picturesque. A gray frock, that fell open, disclosing the buff waistcoat buttoned to the chin and descending below the waist. Breeches of the same color, tied at the knee, where a buckskin boot revealed the shape of the leg. Upon his dark hair, which was very glossy and luxuriant, he wore a delicate cap, topped with a dainty white plume. It must be confessed that there were some objections to the general harmony of the costume. For example, the waistcoat was drawn tightly over the bust, while it fell in wrinkles about the waist, and the boot, small as it was, was too large for the hunter's foot, and the sleeves tightened about the arms until they revealed a firm, round outline. That hunter came stepping along the garden with a kind of stealthy grace, and started back with a somewhat beautiful 2* surprise, as he beheld his warm cheeks and light eyes reflected in the calm mirror of Wissahikon. Beautiful Rose of Wissahikon! “The words of this strange woman, Lady Marion, bewilder me! Ah, I have a secret—yes, there is one thing which I have not told to Arthur! What a strange, dark story seemed upon this lady's tongue, and yet she seemed afraid to tell it! Yet, her parting words I remember well: —`If you have a brother on this side of Eternity, come to my house to-night and I will show you his image, and reveal to you the very scene in which he is placed, at the moment you look upon his image!' How could she guess this yearning desire of my heart, to see that brother of whom my father has often spoken in his moments of agony! I will go to her home, I will dare worse perils than she described, but to have one glance at MY Brother's form!” Yes, she had a secret, which she kept locked within her own bosom. Even from the lover, to whom she entrusted her soul, she kept it, not from any impure motive, but—it may be—that with all her purity and beauty, she was so far a daughter of Eve, as to desire the possession of one secret, only one. Then what a delightful surprise she meditated for her lover, when pressing her new found brother in her arms, she could say: Brother, this is Arthur! Look upon her, as she enters the canoe and glides down the stream. Gently, softly over the tide, the moon upon her face, the boughs stretching out their arms to embrace her! She goes to meet the Lady Marion.—In the summer time I have seen a beautiful green snake, spotted with drops of gold, coiling himself quietly under a rosebush, while a humming bird, green and gold in his soft plumage, hovered near, and near and nearer, until the snake disclosed his fangs, and— But why this dark presentiment? Gently, softly over the tide the boat bore Rose along, while the ripples broke in music on the shore. The idea of a girl living for sixteen years in the solitude of the Wissahikon, her only companion a rough old man, who, with all his rudeness, teaches her those arts, which develope genius and soften the life of a woman, even as the last flash of a rainbow mellows the sky! Very ridiculous, is it not, my dear lover of common place, my dear matter of fact? And yet it is very beautiful; yes, even if a fiction, it is worth all your hard-featured, stony-eyed Truth! But it is Truth. Not Truth, shining with a bloody glare over the scenes of a battle, or growing drowsy with the miasma of a great city's crimes, but Truth as beautiful as the Wissahikon, and as pure.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER THIRD. WASHINGTON, THE KING. The house of the Lady Marion stood alone on the heights of Wissahikon. It was a substantial structure of stone, facing toward the south, its massive front presenting one imposing surface, while on either side, a semi-circular wing increased its picturesque effect. Its steep roof arose in many Gothic shapes, crowned with fantastic chimneys and bordered by heavy cornices along the eaves. Above those roofs a grove of horse chestnut trees extended their grateful shade; their broad green leaves, their substantial trunks were contrasted with the bright verdure of the sward, the rich brown of the gravelled walks, the dark gray of the stone. On the right of the mansion, from among a copse of hazel, the roof of a small summer house, or pavilion, burnt into light. This elegant structure contained but a single room, furnished in a strange, antique style. Two winding carriage roads led from the front of the mansion, under the grove of horse chestnut trees, along a wide lawn that extended for some three hundred yards, until it was terminated by the green hedge-row of a shadowy lane. Behind the mansion sank the wild declivity of Wissahikon, trees and rocks, sweeps of sward, growths of underwood, gentle elevations and green hollows, all mingled together. The mansion contained many chambers, all furnished in contrasted style; many passages, some hollowed from the thick wall, some winding like a serpent's track, some extending broad and deep along the entire extent of the edifice. It is with three apartments in this mansion that our history on the night of July the third, between the hours of ten and twelve, is connected. The pavilion among the hazel trees has also a deep interest for us. Almost at the same time, in the east and in the west wing, in the pavilion and in the banquetting room of Lady Marion's house, scenes of vital interest are in progress. Time had been, when gay equipages, bearing the forms of gallant men and beautiful women, had rolled along the lawn, when noble steeds stood champing the bit before the door, when every window and crevice of the mansion poured out its separate stream of light, and the entire grove blazed in every leaf, with a radiance like day. Then the sound of woman's laughter, the tread of woman's foot bounding in the dance, mingled with the clatter of goblets and the music of a full band. Until the morning dawned, the Wissahikon rung with the sounds of revelry and the old forest thrilled with the clamor of a mad festival. The pavilion, too, shrouded in its copse of hazel, witnessed many a coy meeting, many a scene in which the young maiden, fluttering in satin and brilliant with diamonds, her blood thrilling with the dance and wine, heard with crimsoned cheek and panting bosom the tremulous story, warm from the lips of passion. But now all was dark. Dark the mansion in its many chambers; dark the pavilion in its solitary room; dark the woods in its tangled mazes and winding paths. Not a gleam of light, from pavilion or mansion, illumined the midnight shadows of the grove. And yet, had you taken your position by the large tree, that towers before the door, and watched from dark until midnight, you might have seen many strange guests enter the room. Let us, within the shadows of the grove, wait patiently and behold them as they come. The Lady Marion, with old Michael by her side! It is but dusk; they come from the woods of Wissahikon, and silently enter the hall door. An hour passes—what have we here? A multitude of forms, shrouded, although it is summer time, in cloaks, with scabbards rattling underneath. They have left their horses in yonder grove, hidden by the leaves. One by one they enter the mansion; twenty forms in all, treading with the step of young manhood over the gravelled walks. Another hour! A solitary figure, dressed in a dark habit, appears, glances cautiously around and is gone into the mansion. As he turns his face, we may almost recognize the features of Arthur, Walter or Reginald, as you may please to call him. Silence again; an half hour passes, and an old man, whose dark attire flashes with lace of gold, steps from the shadows and enters the house of Lady Marion. Then the form of a young hunter came hurriedly from the wood in the rear of the house, and, without turning to right or left, glided within the hazel copse which overshadowed the pavilion. Poor Rose of Wissahikon! You will confess that these movements, this strangely contrasted crowd of guests, all, save one, entering the house of Lady Marion, the mystery which envelopes their actions, the secresy with which they move—fills us with surprise, with awe. Between the hours of ten and twelve we will enter the mansion and behold, in three separate chambers, scenes of absorbing interest. Then our steps will wander to yonder pavilion, and, with hushed breath and earnest gaze, we will witness a scene that exceeds them all, not only in its deep interest, but in its strange disclosures. First, let the curtain roll back for the Banquetting Chamber.— What do we see? No goblets of wine? No wreaths of flowers? The light of six wax candles, placed in candlesticks of silver, reveals the wainscotted walls of that wide chamber, which traverses the mansion from north to south. At the southern end a black curtain, drooping from the ceiling to the floor, closes the view. Around a long table, covered with a dark cloth, the strange guests are assembled. No service of silver, nor goblets or plates of gold, nor anything that betokens a festival, do we behold. A sword gleams from the dark cloth of that table; beside it, letters, papers, parchments, bearing the signatures of such men as Thomas Jefferson and John Adams, George Washington and John Hancock, are placed. Do you behold the scene? Those twenty men, all young, with athletic forms and earnest brows, seated around the table—their forms brilliant with warrior costume, every man with his sword unsheathed upon his knee, while his eye is centered upon that erect figure at the head of the board! These are the chivalry of the state and continent; young men with wealth at their beck, true hearts, who never yet having shared in council or battle, beat with fiery impatience to do some service to their native land. And at the head of the table, his form attired in a uniform of dark green, faced with gold, stood Walter, the hunter, his pale, olive cheek, now glowing with strong emotion; his dark eye, flashing a fire that sent its rays to every heart. He stood erect, glancing with conscious pride upon these brave men, who have hailed him Leader! His eye glances along the board; he searchingly surveys those faces. Not a brow but wears it faith, like a signet upon its surface; not an eye but flashed with answering fire to his own. In that clear deep voice which warms the blood to hear, he condenses the deliberations of hours in a few bold words. “The time has come for action. The country—the land which bore us, and which God has given to the free—calls to us for deliverance! Not deliverance merely from the sceptre of George III., but from the wiles of faction—the tricks of anarchists! For days the Congress, sitting in the old Statehouse, has held its secret session! For days with closed doors, and all the indications of mystery, it has pursued its deliberations! To what purpose do these mysterious councils tend? Witness the intercepted letters of its leaders, now spread before you on the table—witness the signatures of Hancock, and Jefferson, and Adams! They would flood the land with blood, not to accomplish its freedom, but to establish on the ruins of the British power the miserable anarchy of a Venetian Senate. They would pour armies forth on the battle field, not so much to crush King George, as to crush George Washington!” He paused, while his flashing eye ran round the throng, as if eager to gather the purpose of men's hearts from their faces. No shout, but a deep murmur pervaded that banquet chamber. From their muttered whispers, we may gain some knowledge of the object of this council. “Jefferson plans the overthrow of Washington!” “Hancock would restore us to the sway of the British King!” “The proofs are there—letters signed by them, and plotting treason!” “Even Washington writes to this patriotic lady—the brave woman who has so mysteriously summoned us together—writes from his camp, and reveals the treachery of Congress!” “We must surround their doors, and scatter their deliberations to the winds!” “Ay, sword in hand, my friends! For the sword is your only cure for the tricks of traitors!” And twenty extended hands held their good swords in the light. At the same moment, from opposite sides of the dark curtain, a face was thrust into view, and as suddenly withdrawn again. This, the scarred visage of Michael the Hunter; that, the beautiful face of Lady Marion. It must be confessed that as Walter stood erect in the presence of his comrades, his marked countenance glaring with the fire of his sworn resolve, he looked, in every inch of his form, the soldier and the hero. “For the assassin there is a gibbet; for the traitor, the sword! To-night, brothers in the good cause—to-night, a committee, appointed by Congress to put their mysterious deliberations into shape, held their council in the city. Jefferson, Adams, Sherman, and Livingston, are that committee, selected to fulfill the dark work of Congress. Lured, either by the hope of titles from the King, in case they betray the country into his hands; or ambitious of positions of power and trust, in case they establish an aristocratic anarchy, like the Republic of Venice—these men have determined the overthrow of Washington. We must trample their schemes into dust! Desperate crimes require desperate remedies! We must surround the house in which these traitors hold their councils—encompass every avenue—encircle the room in which they plan their treachery—and, at the points of our swords, force from their grasp the proofs of their treachery! Ay, we must do it! and before the clock strikes twelve! Then, with the traitors in our power, we will unfurl our flag to the morning light, call the generous spirits of the camp and council to our aid, and, from the Statehouse hall, proclaim the name under which we rally—the name under which we will fight—the name which will conquer, with us—Washington, the King!” He paused, and a silence like the grave pervaded that hall. From side to side, the comrades turned, seeking from each other's faces some explanation of this bold movement. The light of the wax candles flashed along the wainscotted walls, and over the dark curtain. Still, that singular silence prevailed. His brow flushed with emotion, Walter sank in his chair, while only the sound of deep-drawn breath disturbed the stillness of the scene. Slowly—slowly the curtain rolled aside. From its folds, in all her beauty, her voluptuous form attired in a dark habit, stepped forth the Lady Marion, with the form of rough Michael, armed with his rifle, by her side. “Behold!” and she pointed to an object, disclosed by the parting of the curtain. “For that I will fight!” cried old Michael, waving his rifle toward the object. At once a shout, like thunder, echoed along that banquet chamber; at once twenty forms started to their feet, and twenty swords described their circles in the air. You see their faces, glowing with enthusiasm; you behold Walter turn and echo their shout; while the Lady Marion glides to his side, presses his hands within her own, pours the passion of her heaving breast into her dark eyes, and whispers—“Reginald, you have done well!” And there, disclosed by the curtains, stood the portrait of a warrior, whose tall form and majestic face seemed about to start from the canvass, and glide among the guests, and speak to them. A form, such as kings never owned—an eye, that gleamed its soul from a chivalric face; a hand, that grasped its own true sword. There was a crown upon that noble brow. And louder through the banquet chamber—while the Lady Marion, her olive cheek blooming with passion and triumph, glided closer to Walter's side—louder swelled the shout— “Washington, the King!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER FOURTH. LADY MARION'S KISS. In the crescent-shaped room of the east wing, sat an aged man, bending over a table overspread with manuscripts, the light of a solitary candle upon his withered brow. He sat in a capacious arm-chair, his slender form attired in a dark coat, adorned by lace and buttons of gold; while his cambric ruffles were relieved by a long waistcoat of black velvet. His hair, white with age, was plainly gathered back from his face. His entire appearance denoted wealth and station; his high and somewhat narrow forehead, deep gray eyes, and mouth relaxing in a calm smile, betrayed the indications of an enthusiastic nature, whose fire neither the touch of sorrow nor the frosts of age could chill. The semi-circular room was elegantly hung with tapestry of dark purple; the carpet displayed a soft and rich combination of colors; the ceiling rising in a dome, blushed with the delicate tints of the dawn. Altogether, it was a perfect gem of a chamber, worthy of the luxurious taste of Lady Marion. The old man was bent over the table, quietly reading by the light of the lamp, while—as he passed from paper to paper, from letter to letter—his withered face gradually lighted up, and his eye began, by slow degrees, to burn with the fire of youth. For the letters that he read, were the letters of love—the first warm breathings of a heart, now cold forever; written by a hand that long ago was dust! The tears fell from the old man's eyes. He placed the letters in his bosom. Then, he unrolled a huge manuscript, bearing on its cover the words—“Journal of John Landsdowne.” Here, written in a fair, clear hand, there, blotted by tears, again, stained with blood, the journal covered a space of twenty years. But what love and adventures, heroism and murder, were comprised in that history of twenty years! The old man read with a flushed cheek, an eye all fire, a heart that writhed within him. At last as he came to the history of that AWFUL NIGHT, written by the hand of the murderer himself, the bloody record dropped from his hand, and he buried his face in his hands. “And yet he was a brother!” he gasped. “Two weeks ago, standing within the shadow of the ruins of the blasted house, I discovered the fearful history in her grave! “It was the hand of God that guided me there; the same hand leads me to the valley of the Wissahikon!” A shadow fell along the floor, by his side. Do you see that proud form, standing upon the threshold—that countenance stamped with an expression that contracts the brows, while it parts the red lips in a smile? It is the Lady Marion; she advances and lays her hand upon the old man's shoulder. “Ah, is it you, Lady Marion?” he said, raising his eyes. “Little did I think a year ago, when I encountered you, the brightest among the beauties—nay, do not smile, 't is but an old man's compliment!—the brightest among the beauties who surround the throne of King George, that I should ever find you here, living in retirement, among the woods of Wissahikon! You was then known as the `American beauty,' who had given her hand to Sir George Ferrers. Pardon! if my words raise an unpleasant feeling. Sir George died shortly after I saw you at Court. And then, with a heroism worthy of a Spartan woman, you resolved to return to your native land, eager to share the perils of freedom rather than bask in the sunshine of a royal court. Much less did I then imagine that, through your agency, I should one day recover my lost daughter — ” “Yesterday, in the city, you placed those papers in my hands; and I told you where your child was hidden. You were also in search of your nephew, Reginald Lansdowne, of St. Leonard — ” “I bear in my hand his credentials as Delegate from his State, to the Continental Congress. He has been strange— mysterious in his movements for the past year. Heir to an immense estate—in fact, the actual possessor—with talents and genius that fit him to shine, even in the Congress, where so many great men are gathered, he has buried himself from society for nearly a year. Eh! eccentric? your looks seem to say.” “To-morrow you shall clasp your daughter to your arms; to-morrow you shall present these credentials to Reginald Landsdowne, of St. Leonard's — ” “Why not to-night?” and the old man's countenance betrayed an overwhelming anxiety. “Do not ask my reasons!” Her smile was accompanied with one of those glances of her full dark eyes, that flashed but to conquer. “To-morrow, all will be right! To-morrow, all my little plans—ha, ha! you see I have a true woman's taste for mystery—will be fulfilled!” Thus speaking, she left the room, while the old man bent down to his papers again. “All would be well,” he muttered, “if I could only find my lost son! But it is asking too much of Heaven. And yet my researches into his history, from the moment when, but a child, he was torn from his dead mother's side — Well, well! to-morrow will decide all!” “To-morrow!” triumphantly echoed Lady Marion, as she hurried along the corridor and down the stairs. “Ha, ha! to-morrow!” She stood in front of the old mansion, on the stone steps leading to the hall door. In silence, twenty horsemen awaited there—their steeds grouped round the walk—their scabbards seen from beneath the folds of their cloaks. A single horse wheeled from the throng, and his rider, bending over the neck of the impatient steed, removed his chapeau from his pale brow. “Lady Marion, I go to serve my country!” he whispered. She advanced, and standing on the steps of stone, extended her hands! Ah! how that pressure fired the leader's blood! Bending down over the neck of his steed, he—imperceptibly —wound his arms about her neck, and felt her cheek against his own, her heart throbbing through her voluptuous bosom. “If I am successful — ” he whispered. “Return successful,”—a soft voice breathed the words upon his lips, and sealed them with a kiss—“and Reginald Landsdowne, I am yours!” The sounds rose in the light, and twenty horses darted away, bearing their gallant and chivalrous riders toward the city. Away, through the trees, and along the lawn, faint and fainter, the sound of the hoofs, the clattering of scabbards, died on the ear. The figure of a man advanced from the grove, and stood beside Lady Marion. So utterly absorbed was this woman in the emotion resulting from her dark schemes, that she did not notice the presence of the stranger, until after the lapse of a few moments. “Ah! Michael, is it you?” she said, at last. “Take horse, and away; do not lose a moment. While these gentlemen surround the Committee, you must secure the person of President Hancock! Do not return to your home; I will take care that your daughter shall not wonder at your absence! Away!” “For Washington!” the bluff old hunter muttered, as he hurried from the hall. The Lady Marion stood wrapt in thought. “He loves her, with a pure passion, and would dishonor her! Me, he loves, with a passion born of madness;—I can sway him as I will. For me, he will dishonor his name and betray his country! Ha, ha!” Bewitching Lady Marion!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER FIFTH. LADY MARION'S TEAR. It was the bower of a beautiful woman. Three windows, curtained with folds of pale crimson silk, mirrors between each window, reaching from the ceiling to the floor, so that the lovely woman who occupied it, might see a lovely woman like herself whichever way she turned; a luxurious sofa, cushioned with velvet, and an arm-chair whose capacious back her head might rest upon as a pillow—it was the very Temple in which a proud and haughty woman might retire to worship her own beauty. And yet strange to say, the small lamp which hung from the dome-like ceiling, did not reveal the form of a lovely woman. No! Beside a small writing-desk, scattered all over with papers, stood an uncouth figure, broad in the shoulders, attired in a rugged dress, with heavy boots, and a mask of faded crape over his face. It was the Outcast who had attacked Lady Marion in the woods; the robber who had despoiled her bosom of its chain and jewel; the assassin who had prepared for his work of force by tampering with the hunter's rifle. Wo! to the proud woman, if in her most secret retreat she encounters this outcast, with crape upon his face and pistols in his belt! He bent over the table, reading with a low chuckle of delight a letter which the hand of Lady Marion had traced. Looking over his shoulder, we may discover words like these: To the General commanding his Majesty's forces in America— Ere you receive this, you will have learned that the prominent members of the Rebel Congress have been seized and made prisoners, by certain gentlemen who have proclaimed George Washington, the Rebel General, King. At this hour, Hancock, Jefferson, Adams, with other Delegates, are prisoners at my house, near Philadelphia. Thus have we introduced dissension among the ranks of the rebels; while one party prate about a republic, another talk of returning to their allegiance, and a third—I know your excellency will smile—prate of King Washington. How this has been accomplished, will be made known at the proper time. Enough to say, that this Declaration, about which they whispered so deeply, for a month back, this Proclamation of Independence, is now crushed—quite forgotten in the public clamor. Permit me to hope, that in announcing these facts to his Majesty, you will neither forget the services, nor promised reward of Marion. The Fourth of July, 1776. “Ha, ha! draft of a letter to be sent in cypher—” muttered the Outcast—“The good lady anticipates—she may fail—” “She cannot fail,” said a deep voice, and Lady Marion stands beside him. Does the Outcast dart upon her, with the upraised knife, and menace her beauty with the violence, the outrage of a bravo and ruffian? No! He stands for a moment, as if contemplating the singular beauty of her face, the eloquence of her eye, the passion of her swelling bust, her majestic form. Then tearing the cap from his brow, the crape from his face, the rough costume from his form, he stands before us, a young gentleman, slender in figure, clad in a gay British uniform, with light curls of golden hair waving about his florid face! “Tolerably well done: that robber scene! Eh—sis?” he exclaimed, with that air of quiet composure—some call it impudence—which alike distinguishes the fine city gentleman and the supremely fine city blackguard—“The poor devil did not imagine that we got up that little piece of tragedy for his benefit! I've quite a good opinion of myself in private theatricals!” He flung his delicate form upon the sofa, and turned towards the light a face marked by the cold, dead eyes of satiety, the unmeaning lip and vacant stare of dissolute indulgence. “All is safe,” his sister exclaimed, pacing the room—“Confusion in the camp of the Rebels—Reginald Landsdowne in my power—” “Sis, do you really love that man?”—you can see the sneer upon the face of that finished man of the world—“Beyond your ambitious schemes—your title and your promised power, do you care for him? pale-faced, melancholy Don Quixotte that he is?” The brother was frightened by his sister's look. “Do I care for him? Why have I deserted the glare and splendor of the British Court, for this dark path of treachery and intrigue? Why coined my soul into desperate deeds, in order to combine men of various interests into one great enterprise? Why all this mystery, this craft, yes, I will say it, this crime? Do I love him? One year ago, I beheld that pale, melancholy face, standing out from among the shallow-visaged courtiers; I felt the light of those deep, earnest eyes, and from that hour loved Reginald Landsdowne! Yes, all my schemes shall—must end, in placing a coronet upon his brow, the title of Earl before his name! Love him? 'Tis of such men, kings are made!” Pacing over the carpet, she clenched her hands upon her bosom, while her eyes flashed that singular and peculiar light, which made her look like a beautiful Demon. “But you forget my part of the bargain, sis—” cried the brother, assuming an easier position on the sofa—“I forged those papers, bearing the signatures of Jefferson and the other rebels. I aided your schemes. I have made myself shockingly disgusting to look upon, for your sake. Now comes my reward. The Rose of Wissahikon yesterday was but a poor peasant maid. Now, she is the heiress of some sweet lands, and delicious stores of gold. Your dear brother is in want of lands and gold, and is willing to take a wife into the bargain. What need of a long courtship, when—” “Pshaw! Need you make me the partner of your schemes?” —she paused before him, her eyes flashing scorn—“go! if you have your plan arranged, go and execute it! Tell not to me your schemes—for with all my ambition, Gerald—with all the feverish thirst of power—I am a woman!” For once she blushed. Yes, blushed, over the neck and cheeks and brow, while her head fell slowly on her bosom.— The youthful gentleman, whose dead eyes and colorless lips and florid cheeks, betrayed a premature old age, surveyed his magnificent sister with a glance of surprise. All that Heaven had bestowed of the Man, upon this darling of vice, had long ago dribbled out from his veins, leaving his heart as cold as his leaden eye. He could not comprehend the remorse of his sister. “Go!” she cried, as that pure impulse of her woman's nature again bathed her cheek and brow with crimson. “The anguish of the father, to-morrow, when he learns his daughter's fate—the curse of Reginald when he learns her shame—these will be hard to bear, aye more dangerous than the knife or rifle of old Michael, the hunter.” “I will arrange this little matter,” said Gerald Moynton, as he pushed negligently aside his golden curls—“excuse me, sis, for a young lady is anxiously waiting to `see her lost brother!' ” He lounged languidly from the room, leaving Lady Marion alone, her arms clasped across her bosom, her head bowed low. In vain that pressure of the clasped hands; it could not still the volcano of contending passions, raging within the breast. In vain that drooping of the head; it could not hide the shadow of the face, the quivering of the lip, the eye gleaming with one, only one drop of pity. Blessed be Heaven for that solitary tear.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER SIXTH. Wayaniko. In the darkness of the summer house, Rose awaited the coming of the Astrologer, who was to disclose her brother's fate. The windows of the solitary room were closed, not the ray of a star, or the gleam of a taper, found entrance there. From the moment that she passed the threshold, closing the only door as she entered, the darkness of the place had not been broken by a ray, nor its death-like silence disturbed by a sound. Yet the carpet which her footstep pressed was soft and luxurious; the wall which her fingers touched, was shrouded in hangings of satin; the chair in which she sank was cushioned in softest velvet, that yielded like a pillow to her form. Attired in that hunter's garb, she laid her head on one shoulder, and resigned herself to her thoughts. The strange story of Lady Marion, how in all its hues of sunshine and cloud, in all its thrilling words of blood and tears, it rose once more upon her soul! “Within these wild solitudes, dwells an old man, who has made the future his study for seventy years, and wrung supernatural truth, even from the grasp of death. Go to the pavilion, he will meet you there! Your lost brother shall be revealed to you; you shall behold him, even as he is, whether in health or sickness, poverty or wealth!” How could she doubt words so kind, spoken with beaming eyes and soft hands gently pressed with her own? Perchance, in that moment, Lady Marion spoke but the sincere feèling of her heart; perchance it was but a dear surprise that she intended; perchance from the very shadow of that pavilion the brother would start, and gather the sister to his breast, perchance— But those words spoken to Gerald Moynton in her bower? Rose was thinking of her lost brother, when she fell asleep. Such a beautiful dream! A winding path, leading from a summer valley, green with trees and beautiful with flowers along the ascent of a hill among the trunks of centuried oaks. A garden so wild and deserted, its scanty flowers choked by weeds. Then, through the tangled paths, she beheld a blackened wall, with the blue sky gleaming through its desolate windows. Fearfully across that threshold she passed—O, what sight of horror was here! The half bared form of a beautiful woman lay extended on the hearth, her bosom rent by a hideous gash, and a little babe stretched out its tiny hands, and played with the long dark hair, dabbled in its mother's blood. As though a hand was at her throat, pressing the breath from her bosom with its iron clutch, Rose struggled, and after a moment like the agony of death, awoke. As she glanced around the park pavilion, a voice unnaturally deep and hollow thrilled on her soul. “Maiden! would'st thou behold thy brother's form.” Was it but a continuation of her dream? Scarce knowing what she said, Rose gasped, “I would!” From the darkness of that chamber, as from the vault of a midnight sky, a faint light struggled into birth, and played upon the maiden's face. Her form is dark, but do you see that face bathed in a pale crimson glow, the eyes dilating, the lips slowly parting, the hair waving back from the white brow! It stands out from the gloom, like a cherub face, painted among misty clouds. “The brother comes!” said that voice, whose source was invisible. Rose bent forward with hushed breath, and beheld a mirror glimmering in that pale crimson light. A mirror that now was lost in clouds of light golden mist, and now seemed like a midnight sky, gleaming with a single star. From its centre shone that light, the solitary star! “Ah! I hear his step—he comes through the wood—his foot is on the threshold—he is here!” As Rose gasped these words, her whole frame quivering with an emotion almost supernatural, a sudden light flashed from the darkness, bathed her face in darkness, and revealed the form of a young man, who, with his arms folded, stood gazing upon her with a sneering lip, and dull, leaden eyes. Gerald Moynton and his victim! “Sister, I have come!” he said, and extended his arms. At the same moment a mass of perfumed vapor, rolling in soft clouds, fills the pavilion, and penetrates the veins of the unprotected girl. She felt all power over her limbs or motions gliding from her, while her mind shone out in renewed vigor. A lulling sensation pervaded every nerve, a dreamy languor, the result of the pungent vapor, which filled the place, possessed her form; she had not power to move a hand or foot, while her very soul shrank within her at the sight of this man, with the pale face and leaden eyes. “You! my brother! N-o-o-o! she faintly gasped. Her form, thrown helplessly on the chair, one limb crossed over the other, her arms resting by her side, as though deprived of all the power of motion; her head laid on the right shoulder; the features perfectly calm and statue-like, while the cheek glows with a faint flush, and her eyes emit a soft fire, diffused like luminous moisture over their surface, between the half closed lids. She was very beautiful, the helpless Rose of Wissahikon! But Gerald Moynton had no pity. His jaded countenance faintly glowed, his lip was compressed, but his cold, stony eyes—from which the lowest vice had stolen forever the fire of youth—emitted no flashing light. “I am your brother!” he said, and took her hand. She quivered faintly, made a motion like one oppressed by a nightmare, and moved her lips, but could not utter a sound. O, she shrank from his polluted touch with all her soul, but the misty vapor which filled the room, rendered her helpless as though she had been chained with cords of iron. “You see, my pretty one, and I am your brother, and I love you!” Bending languidly forward, he kissed her with his colorless lips;—yes, pressed those lips which resembled a rose-bud torn in twain—and at the same moment fell like a weight to the floor. Fell, stunned by a sudden blow; fell, trampled by a firm foot! There, before the motionless maiden, towered a tall form, clad in a many colored blanket, whose rich dyes swept from his broad shoulders to the ground, while his bronzed forehead was surmounted by a solitary plume. He stood there, like a king upon his throne; the tiger's skin, which enveloped his form beneath the blanket, relieved by the gleam of a hunting knife. In one arm a rifle; his limbs cased in leggings of buckskin; moccassins upon his feet, he stood before her, his neck rising proudly from his broad shoulders, while his dark red face, with its aquiline nose, firm mouth and prominent chin, was strangely relieved by clear blue eyes. An Indian of the forest, with clear blue eyes! “Sister, I have come at last!” he said, that stern red man, and stretched forth his arms. “Brother!” she cried, and felt herself drawn toward his breast. “We parted many years ago”—said that voice, speaking clearly with a strong Indian accent—“Beside the body of the dead woman, our mother. Many suns, many moons, have gone since then. Sixteen times since that hour, there have been flowers and snows. We meet again! You the Rose of the Valley, the flower of Wissahikon! I, the White Indian Wayaniko!” Rose heard the voice, and felt her senses glide from her like the dew from the flower before the morning sun. When she again unclosed her eyes, an old man bent over 3 her—she felt his tears upon her face, his grey hairs touch her cheek; she heard him whisper “Daughter!” By her side, that tall Indian form gazing upon her, with those clear blue eyes, shining from his dark red face. Rose, still wrapt in a kind of half consciousness, hears them converse together; hears with blood now burning like lava, now freezing like death, the dark story, in which the names of Walter, Arthur, Reginald are mingled with the name of Lady Marion. She beholds the credentials in her father's hand; even now her lover goes to do a work of treason, perchance murder. It is a strange, a stormy history! All she knows, all she feels, is that her lover is in danger. Darting from the chair, she seizes those credentials, dashes through the door, and clad as she is, in her hunter's garb, hurries toward the lane where the carriage waits for her. The father, the son, stand gazing in each other's face, as though stricken dumb, by this sudden energy of the brave girl. On, brave Rose, on! The glen is past, then the cliff is won, and last of all, the wood of pines is threaded by your frenzied steps. In the shadiest nook of the sequestered lane, the faithful negro in his gay livery, sitting on the box of the carriage, beholds a slender form dart from the bushes, and in a moment glide within the carriage door. Away, mettled steeds, away! Through the shadows of the night, you see the carriage ascend the steep of yonder distant hill. “Ask me not now, father, the cause of my sudden appearance!—the explanation of these mysteries. Be it enough to say, I know all! I must away to the city to save my sister— save your brother, who now goes to do violence to the chief of your nation's council—and save this Reginald, who wears my sister's peace within his breast!” And as the noble Indian form left the pavilion, Martin Landsdowne sank on his knees, and thanked God for the recovery of these children, whom he had never seen, since that moment when they were torn by rude hands from the bosom of the dead mother. Tossed by contending passions, her brow disfigured by a frown, her eyes glaring in her livid face, Lady Marion gazed on her discomfitted brother, paced hurriedly along her chamber, and with that muttering of low-toned words, scattered her dark hair by the roots. “Foiled, and now! Now, when the triumph was ours! Ah, it is too much! Rise, Sir—do not crouch pale and thunder-stricken there, but saddle my horse, and get me some arms. The night is but half spent!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER SEVENTH. THE COUNCIL IN THE OLD STATEHOUSE. Through old Philadelphia, at dead of night, we will hasten, with hushed breath and stealthy tread. Not through the Philadelphia of our day, which extends for miles on miles, a wilderness of red brick, a gorgeous panorama of wealth and misery—reaching from the marble temple consecrated with the name of Girard, to the ark-like structure of the Navy-yard—from the Elm of Shakamaxon to that palace which rises on the Schuylkill, a mansion for the poor—from river to river—from green hills on the north, to the sloping meadows of the Neck, on the south—a beautiful city, with such elegant streets—such dark alleys—such white banks, and such picturesque jails;—such magnificent churches—some rising in the pride of their varied architecture, and some blackening in the day, rearing the awful witness of their blasted walls to the blue sky of God! No! almost the only thing of the old Philadelphia that yet remains is the Hall of the Declaration, and that speculation dare not batter into ruins—the lust of money cannot gnaw into dust! Even as the Hebrew people of old solemnly cursed the man who removed the sacred landmark, or stoned to atoms the wretch who spat upon his mother's gray hairs, so let him be treated who removes a brick or pollutes an inch of glorious Independence Hall! Old Philadelphia, as it lay beneath the midnight sky, on the 3d of July, 1776, was altogether a different thing from the Philadelphia of 1847. Along the Delaware, two miles north and south; from the Delaware to the west, but a mile at most:—such was its extent. From where Broad street now extends—the most beautiful avenue in the world for gay young gentlemen, ambitious of a fast-trotting horse—to the waves of the Schuylkill, all was a thick wood, as wild as the red men whom it sheltered, not a hundred years ago. From Bush Hill for a mile or two into the city, were green fields, beautiful hills, and picturesque country-seats. In brief, some four or five cities, like the old Philadelphia, could, with ease, be laid to sleep in the lap of the modern “Brotherly-love.” Through these streets, then let us hurry; in front of the Statehouse, which arises from a green lawn, overspread with trees, and encircled by a rude board fence, let us stay our steps, and survey the scattered crowds who cluster there. The clock whose face is seen near the top of the abutment projecting from the rear of the Statehouse, points to the hour of twelve; the 3d of July is near its end, and, flashing on the world, a beautiful thing of godlike hopes, the Fourth of July trembles on the verge of birth. What mean these crowds? Those voices, whispering low? The mingled garb of merchant, mechanic, farmer and laborer, scattered over the lawn? Listen! For days Congress has been in secret session, and a strange rumor broods upon the air, that they are planning some deed which will startle the world! Only one window of the old Statehouse emits a ray of light. Light, through carefully closed curtains, comes forth in trembling rays, and dies on the darkness of the lawn. While you immense cloud gathers over the Statehouse—so black, so dense, so like a pall—let us hasten up these wide stairs, along this dark hall, through the darker corridor, into this small room, separated by partitions from the larger chambers of the second-story, and hung with plain tapestry of a rich dark color. It is a simply furnished room. A huge table of solid oak, on which a shaded lamp is placed, a few heavy chairs, a curtain, hanging across the ceiling, and marking a dark space of some few feet between its folds and the narrow door. You behold this Council Chamber of the old Statehouse. Around that table are seated five men, whose various faces and different attitudes strike you with a deep interest. Alone, at the head of the table, bending over an unfolded sheet, traced with the characters of a firm, round hand, you behold a tall, athletic man, clad in a plain costume of iron gray, such as a farmer who dwelt in the quiet of his fields might wear. His hair is sandy—almost red; his complexion somewhat fair, but marked with freckles; his features bold and prominent, but his clear gray eyes light up his face, and warm each feature with the fire of a determined soul. As he bends over the paper, you see his long finger pass from line to line, while his cheek, warming with a crimson flush, betrays the presence of deep emotion. That is Thomas Jefferson, a Delegate from Virginia, who has distinguished himself in Congress, as a “Silent member, but prompt, frank, explicit, and decisive; not so much renowned for great speeches, as for his literary and scientific attainments.”* * Words of John Adams. On his right, leaning back in the wide arm-chair, sat a man dressed in a rich suit of brown velvet, his hands folded calmly over his chest. Not so tall, but somewhat larger in bulk than his companion, his face ruddy in the cheeks, intricate with wrinkles where the brows meet, piercing in the eyes, displays at once the fever and irritability of genius. That is John Adams, the Delegate from Boston, who thunders, three times a day, in that voice that wakes up men's souls— “Great Britain is the natural enemy of America!” Far back, in the shadows, you see a mild face, beaming with a gentle smile about the lips, the eyes full of calm light, the forehead relieved by brown hair, silvered with age, and falling in heavy curls behind the ears, stamped with the outlines of a giant intellect. Benjamin Franklin, the printer boy, who has lured the lightnings from the sky, and hurled them at thrones of kings. On one side of Franklin, a man, whose short stout form is clad in a dress of dark green—whose ruddy face, stamped with the traces of an honest heart, is also marked by the lines of thought. Roger Sherman, the shoemaker of Connecticut. There a gentleman, who is attired in a rich garb of dark velvet, while his face, somewhat jovial in its expression, sparkles with the light of flashing black eyes, that glance to and fro, with a restless expression. That is Robert R. Livingston, of New York. “I like that paper, Jefferson,” said Adams, drawing his chair nearer to the table; “I am delighted with its high tone—its flights of oratory; especially that concerning negro slavery, which, however, I am afraid will touch our Southern brethren who own slaves —” One of those cold smiles which gave such a cutting sarcasm to the face of Jefferson, now crossed his lips. “Or, our Northern brethren, some of whom are carriers of slaves,” he quietly said. “There is one word, however, which I do not like,” exclaimed Adams. “You call King George a “tyrant.” Now, I regard his crimes as rather of an official than a private nature —” “Yes, Claudius Nero was a gentleman of the most amiable qualities, and yet he murdered a few thousand Christians every day, and fiddled sometimes over burning Rome.” Not a smile ruffled the severity of Franklin's face, as he uttered this sentiment. “To be sure,” said Livingston; “Lexington and Bunker Hill were fine illustrations of the amiable, Christian character of our good King.” “It is indeed severe to call him a tyrant, when he values our heads at such a reasonable price,” said Sherman, the shoe-maker. The irritable blood of Adams began to glow. “Well, have it as you will—I care not for the weak, misguided man. My love for his government has been recorded in my actions.” He grasped Jefferson by the hand—“That is a noble document—such as they never dreamed of in Greece or Rome. It does you eternal honor.” A glow of pleasure pervaded Jefferson's face. To be praised by stout-hearted John Adams, was worth fine gold. Just fifty years and six hours from the moment when Jefferson and Adams joined hands in that council room, they lay on their death-beds, separated by a distance of four hundred miles, yet joined in one glory, their freezing ears filled with the cannon-thunder and earthquake-shout of the Fourth of July. “Read it again, Jefferson,” said Franklin. As Jefferson prepared to read the paper once again, a noise— like a stealthy footstep—was heard, behind yonder curtain. They did not heed that sound of warning. Yet, behind the curtain and in the corridor, without the chamber, twenty swords gleamed through the darkness. They did not hear that sound, nor the deep whisper of Reginald Landsdowne of St. Leonard's—“A moment, and the conspirators are ours!” Thomas Jefferson read the Declaration once again. How his eyes flashed—how his deep tones rung through the chamber, as he uttered words like these:— “These facts—(the long recital of galling wrongs)—have given the last stab to agonizing affection, and manly spirit bids us renounce forever these unfeeling brethren. We must endeavor to forget our former love for them, and to hold them as we hold the rest of mankind, enemies in war, in peace friends. We might have been a free and a great people together; but a communication of grandeur and of freedom it seems is below their dignity. Be it so, since they will have it. The road to happiness and to glory is open to us too. We will tread it apart from them.” Gloriously have we trod the path! Blazing in light, it led us through the Revolution, through the horrors of the last war with England, and now, traversing wastes of sand, and deserts of chapparal, it conducts the hardy column of Democratic truth to the palace of Montezuma. Even now,* * May the 11th, 1817. perchance, the Banner of the Stars, that waved so gallantly above the heights of Bunker Hill, floats over the waters of Palenque, and crowns the last stronghold of Azteca! There was the strong fervor of enthusiasm upon the face of Jefferson, as he uttered the last word of the Declaration. “But this is not all!” he said—“When the war is over and our freedom won, the People must make a new Declaration.— They must declare the rights of man, the individual, sacred above all craft in priesthood or government. They must, at one blow, declare the end of all those trickeries of English Law, which, garnered up from the charnels of age, bind the heart and will with lies. They must perpetuate republican truth, by declaring the homestead of every American, a holy thing, which no law can touch, no juggle wrest, from his wife and children. Until this is done, the Revolution will have been fought in vain.” These words created strong emotions in the breasts of his compatriots. “This is true, but we must take care to preserve the balance of power in our government.” exclaimed Adams; “with all its faults, the English system seems the best—” “The king pulling one way, the house of lords tugging another, while the commons is hauled about by both together!” exclaimed Franklin, with one of his quiet smiles. Sherman and Livingston exchanged meaning glances, and joined in his smile. Again that sound behind the curtain! But Jefferson rose to his feet, his angular form displayed in the shaded light. In a tone of deep conviction, he spoke. Oh, that I could write his words of holy truth in every American heart! “Our People must take care that the labor, the blood of the Revolution, is not spent in vain. There is one evil, above all others, which I fear—the government of this Confederacy centralized at the Capitol, surrounded by innumerable hordes of officeholders, dependent on its will, and backed by a Judiciary independent of the People. You may talk, gentlemen, of an age not being prepared for their progress into perfect freedom, you may whisper `It is not yet time!' but the word of God, the history of centuries, attests the fact, that for a people determined to be wholly free, it is always Time; that for an age resolved to work out its destiny, it is always Day!” When the heart of Jefferson was in his words, his freckled cheek glowed with crimson, and his eye flashed the fire of a soul conscious of its powers. So now, rising above his compatriots, he thrilled in every nerve, while his words shot like electric fire, to every heart. “We must make the Declaration unanimous,” he said, resuming his seat. “For days the debate has been fierce and tumultuous. But now we have nerved the timorous, frowned the wavering from our councils, and combined the forces of freedom in one solid front. That was a noble deed, the Declaration made by Pennsylvania, on the 28th of June!—We have tested our men, and know them! Yet there is one man absent, whose presence I especially desire—the lately elected Delegate from the State of — who has not yet taken his seat. I mean —” The State House clock striking the hour of twelve, interrupted his words. The Fourth of July was born. “I mean Reginald Landsdowne of Landsdowne!” “He is here!” said a deep voice. At the word, the curtain was dashed aside, and the gleam of swords shone through the Council Room. Silently around that council table, circled twenty gallant forms, surrounding Jefferson and his compatriots with a wall of glittering steel. Silently a solitary form advanced; stood before Jefferson; his tall form heaving with emotion, his pale face traced with the fiery resolve of that hour. “Reginald Landsdowne!” said Jefferson, rising with calm dignity. “I am here! Conspirators, you are our prisoners!” cried Reginald, placing his sword before the heart of Jefferson. “Prisoners?” echoed Adams, starting to his feet. “Yes, your plans are known, your schemes are revealed!” spoke Reginald, his breast heaving with deep indignation.— “Ah! shame, eternal shame upon your heads! You, the Prophets of Freedom, to become her executioners! You, Jefferson, to plan the overthrow of Washington—you, Franklin, to fling the sceptre of the Continent once more at the feet of the English king,—you, Sherman, Livingston, stern republicans as you are, to join in this work—and Adams, first and bravest of the heroes of the council, you who nominated Washington, to plot his downfall!” An indignant murmur pervaded the council chamber, while the band drew closer round their prisoners. “Surely, this is some dream!” cried Jefferson, very calmly, but with a flash of anger rising on his face. “Say rather, a plot to assassinate us!” cried Adams, all his tumultuous passion flushing to his face. Franklin quietly folded his arms, and whispered with Livingston and Sherman. They heard the murmurs of the men, who gathered at their backs, and saw those swords gleam through the darkness, but were calm. “You are our prisoners!” The form of Reginald rose to its full stature, as he spoke the words. “To crush your schemes, we are forced to control your liberty, until the People know your crime. To meet the forces of the enemy, traitors within and foes without, we are resolved to stand in one solid phalanx, our leader, Washington the King. And through that dim council chamber, with the lights burning in the centre, and glittering on the blades of twenty swords, rose the deep chorus—“Washington the King!” At that word, which in a breath revealed the canker-worm always gnawing at the root of republican freedom—the elevation of one man to supreme power — Jefferson stood aghast. “Reginald, you are mad! Read this, aye read, and then hurl charges like these at our heads!” He pointed to the Declaration, but with his head erect, his sword circling through the darkened air, Reginald started proudly back. “Read! Have I not read the proofs of your treachery? Comrades, what say ye all? Have we not seen the names of these men attached to letters as base as they are decisive? Gentlemen, there is no need of further words. We are resolved to crush your cabal with our lives!” Now came the crisis of the scene. Jefferson and Adams stood side by side, while at the other end of the table, Franklin, Sherman, and Livingston formed a group. The face of Jefferson was pale, Adams crimson; Sherman stood with his lip fixedly clenched, while the hand of Livingston sought the hilt of the small dress-sword which he wore. Franklin alone was calm. “Advance! You are prisoners, gentlemen!” Jefferson quietly removed his chair, retreated a step, and confronted Landsdowne, with his unquailing eye. “Do not lay your hand on me,” said he, in that calm tone. There was danger in his look. Reginald advanced, his sword clenched in his good right hand, his soul resolved when a circumstance occurred that deepened the tumultuous emotions of the scene. A hand was laid upon the arm of Reginald. He turns, all the blood in his body rushing to his face, he clutches his sword resolved to revenge the touch of violence, and holds its glittering blade above the head of—Rose! In the hunter's dress, her knees bending beneath her with fatigue, her arms extended, her head drooping on her bosom, she lifts her eyes to his face. “Read!” she gasps, and forces the packet in his hand “It is a plot—a scheme, to lure you on to ruin. Behold these forgeries! Ah! I have foiled this dark and scheming woman. Thank God! It is not yet too late!” You may imagine that scene! Every eye centred upon the disguised woman, who, like a flower shaken by the storm, trembled before Reginald, as he stood with sword sunk into the floor, his eyes fixed upon his eredentials as Delegate to the Continental Congress. For a moment he stood as one bewildered in a dream. The swords of his comrades fell; Jefferson gazed upon him in sincere pity, Franklin and the other patriots awaited in silence the issue of the scene. “O, Arthur,” cried the brave girl, her bosom beating against the vest, until it burst the fastenings—“Do not wonder, do not pause. I cannot explain it—I know not how it is! But believe it is all a scheme contrived for your ruin. O, my heart beats and I am so faint—I would fain tell you all, but my father—my brother—” The storm of feeling shook the Rose, at last. Spreading out her arms, while her hair, falling from beneath her cap, waved over her form, she fell. But Franklin caught her in his arms, exclaiming as he gazed upon the young cheek, gleaming so white, through the intervals of her flowing hair—. “Upon my life, it is a woman!” Franklin was a Philosopher. Meanwhile Jefferson and Adams examined the papers, which Rose had scattered on the tables. “Forgeries, whispered the former. “Another trick of his Majesty's minions, and by no means the weakest. Those forgeries are excellently done.” Reginald's sword clattered on the floor. 3* That sound jarred through the council chamber like a knell. Ere it had died away, a louder sound, crashed like thunder on the air. Twenty swords fell to the floor. Reginald stood as if in a dream, pressing the paper with the same hand that clasped his burning brow. “Speak, Landsdowne!” cried his comrades, their voices mingling in chorus—“Is it a trick—have we been duped! Speak—are these good men and true?” It was now Jefferson's turn to prove his magnanimity. “Reginald, read this,” he quietly said, and led young Landsdowne to the table. Reginald bent down. You behold that pale face, with lips working, the eyes rolling, as it hurries over the immortal lines you perceive the clenched hands laid on the table. “O, shame!” he gasped, beating his brow against those hands which rested on the table—“To be made the tool of this ambitious woman.” They could see the blushes glow beneath his hands. “But there is a remedy for it all! I can yet atone for my fault! To-morrow, Jefferson, I will sign it, and, then if need be, spend my life to maintain its truth!” He raised the draft of the Declaration above his head, while his comrades gathered round him, and Jefferson shook him by the hand. At the same moment, Rose nestling in the arms of Franklin, unclosed her eyes, while a smile like heaven blushed over her face. Parting the long hair from her cheeks, she gazed with dim eyes—shining through their tears—upon her lover, and whispered, “Arthur! I was not too late!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER EIGHTH. THE PURPLE CHAMBER. The Purple Chamber in the city mansion of Reginald, combined in one view all that is gorgeous in luxury, delicate in taste, or beautiful in art. Separated by a wide saloon from the street, its four windows looked out upon the trees and flowers of an extensive garden. Soft carpets beneath the feet, a wide ceiling, warmed with the richest creations of the painter above your head—wherever you turned, a white statue gleaming in beauty on you—its dark rich purple tapestry, whether bathed in moonlight, or gilded by the sun, imparted a luxurious tone to the chamber of Reginald Landsdowne. It was now three o'clock on the morning of the Fourth of July. A small lamp stood on yonder marble table, placed in front of the mirror, which reached from the ceiling to the floor. By its light you behold the bed in yonder recess, with the white counterpane, seen between the intervals of the silken canopy. Those curtains agitated by the slight breeze that finds entrance, wave in luxurious folds from the dome of the canopy to the floor. It is three o'clock, and across the threshold of the Purple Chamber, there glided two youthful forms, one reclining on the other's breast and arm. As they approach the light we will stand here in the shadow and behold them. One, a young man, whose dark hair falls aside from a countenance marked with the traces of much suffering, yet glowing with a calm joy on the bold cheek, and shining with deep happiness, in the large full eyes. It is Arthur, Walter, Reginald, attired still in that uniform of green faced with gold. Leaning on his arm, her head upon his breast, the Rose of Wissahikon raises her eye to his face, and her beautiful hair flowing over the hands which gather her to his heart, hides in its glossy veil her hunter's dress. It was said by a shrewd Philosopher, perhaps Dr Franklin; certainly one who had given much attention to the subject, that the most beautiful thing of all that is beautiful, in this lower world, was a—beautiful woman. I am disposed to improve upon this thought. Standing in the shadow of this Purple Chamber, I am induced to confess that of all beautiful women, the most bewitching is a pure girl attired in a picturesque hunter's costume, which in its turn is only seen by glimpses through the intervals of her flowing auburn hair. That hair looks brown, and black, and purple by turn, and reaches to her knees. The word that passed Reginald's lips, as treading softly over the threshold, he bore the maiden along the chamber, was remarkable. “This is our bridal chamber!” Strange words these, when you remember that Reginald is yet ignorant of the relationship of this poor peasant maid to a wealthy planter, unconscious of the dear tie which binds her to the heart of Martin Landsdowne. He only knows that she has saved him; saved more than his life, his honor. “This is our bridal chamber, Rose!” She should have made some eloquent reply, expressed surprise at the change in her lover's appearance, or suffered an exclamation of wonder to pass her peasant lips, she should, indeed— But she did not. Nestling on his breast, in the most natural manner in the world, the Rose of Wissahikon bloomed beneath his gaze, and felt her lips mingle with his. And then the air that shook the curtains of the window, also shook her long hair, until it waved and shone again. At this moment, as bending over his bride, he pressed his kiss upon her lips, the hangings of yonder couch, rustled to and fro. Is it with the wind? Gaze upon that form emerging from the curtains, that face, dark with conflicting passions, its eyes dazzling with almost fiendish light, and answer me! The Lady Marion stood a silent witness of this scene of love. Her dark hair, which was gathered back from her brow in one rich mass, made her pale face seem more pale; her livid lip and breath that came and went in gasps; her small foot pressed against the carpet, quivering as it peeped from her dark dress, all told the story of her passion and her agony. Yet the pistol in her extended hand, speaks a language plainer still. She raises it, and in terrible silence takes deliberate aim, and fires! The jarring report crashes through the chamber, but cannot drown the sound of that form, plunging heavily on the carpet. The smoke clouds the sight, but cannot conceal that face with the ghastly wound between the brows. O, it is not Reginald, in his young manhood, nor Rose, in the dewey freshness of her beauty —. The heart grows cold to think it. As the smoke clears away we behold that form. There, tossing in the carpet, clutching its surface with cramped fingers, pouring blood upon its flowers from the hideous wound, between the brows; now writhing until the heels touch the back of the head; now stiffening out like a thing of marble, an old man struggles with death. On one side, pale, aghast, at her own work, looking if possible more livid, the Lady Marion stands with her hands dropped by her side. Opposite, Rose clings to Reginald's neck, glancing over her shoulder, at the hideous struggles of the dying man. One word burts from every lip— “Michael!” Yes, it is the old hermit of the woods; he stood upon the threshold; he saw the levelled pistol; he saved the life of Rose, the child of the murdered woman, whom he once so madly loved. You may be sure that his struggles were horrible but brief. That wound had went straight to the altar of life, and dashed its light into darkness. He raised himself upon his knees, clasped his cramped hands, and with the blood pouring over his glassy eyes, gasped two brief words with his last breath: Your oath!” Yes, even in that moment he cared for the honor of Rose. Yes, Reginald, your oath, uttered in the deep woods in the evening hour! Now answer with a true heart, or shrink, a cringing perjurer, before the last look of the dying man. “She is my wife!” he said, and the old man sank slowly down, and moved no more. He died without knowing that his brother lived. And yet that brother stole across the threshold, and bent over his still bleeding form, until his white hairs mingled with the blood, flowing from the fatal wound. He died ignorant of the existence of that brother's son. And yet he was there, there beside his sister Rose. He had followed the old hunter to the house of President Hancock, and on the very threshold, whispered a word which directed his steps at once to Reginald's house. Following them, joined at the door by his father, he had heard the sound of the pistol, and now beheld the sad result. He towered there, the White Indian, gazing with impenetrable features on the scene, while his very heart was torn within him. From his broad shoulder drooped the war blanket; in his tunic of tiger-skin gleamed the hunting knife. He gazed upon the mangled form, and did not weep. “I must to my tribe again!” he said—“Too much blood here!” The emotion of Reginald and Rose, need not be told. Read it in his downcast head, in her eyes, turned wildly over her shoulder. And far back in the Bridal Chamber, leaning against the Bridal Bed, which she never might adorn, a pallid, gibbering thing, her finger on her lip, and her unloosened hair falling wildly over her face, the Lady Marion rent the air with peals of horrible laughter. She was an Idiot.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER NINTH. THE FOURTH OF JULY, 1776. The mild clear light of a summer day was upon the roof and steeple of the old State House. Beautifully in the beams of that calm hour, glowed every point of the massive structure, its windows glittering like living gold, its roofs with heavy ornaments along the eaves, bathed in light, while the steeple stood clearly out, against the blue sky. It was toward the close of day, when the trees in the lawn shook their leaves in the rays of the setting sun, while over the city from the forest on the west, to the waves of the Delaware, the mild golden radiance invested the roofs in a veil of sunbeams. The zenith of the sky, calm as an infant's sleep, extended above the scene, a dome of clear deep azure, and on the west, over the wide sweep of woods, huge masses of white clouds, piled up in the horizon—their forms of snow, contrasted with the green of the foliage, the blue of the heaven—slowly rolling apart, disclosed the full glory of the setting sun. Such a sun had never set for eighteeh hundred years. Not that its glorious beams arrest our attention alone, nor the many dyes which it flung in parting, over roof and tree and sky, alone attract our gaze, but because the Day, which its setting closed, marked an Era in the history of Man. On that day a Continent in fierce travail for its rights, struggled into birth and became a People. As evening came on, the crowd which had all day long thronged the arena of the State House, and darkened in the open space along its front, or gathered in a dense mass, under the old trees of the lawn, was swelled by new accessions. It seemed as if the city had poured its people from their firesides, and sent them thronging into the scene. Nor was the crowd merelv composed of the rich, in their soft apparel, nor of the poor in their work-day attire; but the men whose hearts beat for their country, were there, and among their ranks, with sidelong looks and ominous scowls, glided the creatures of the king. The women too, were there, some with their young faces glowing more beautiful with love of country, some with their warm lips curling in sneers, as the word “Freedom” whispered on the air, and some, with anxious faces, holding in their arms those babes, whose fathers were absent fighting the battles of their native land. They came in silken attire, they came in their coarse linsey peasant garb, they came in matronly apparel, with a mild light playing over their matured brows; the women of the city and the field, forgetting the severe modesty of their sex, in the interest of the day, were there. For all day long—from the moment when the first beam of light played upon the State House steeple, until now, when its last kiss lingers there—a rumor had crept through the city, and deepened and spread until it filled every heart. And all day long, without a moment's interval, the Congress had been holding their secret session in the large hall, on the east of the main avenue, while the people awaited in quivering anxiety the result of their deliberations. As the day wore on, that rumor deepened, and now, from lip to lip a word thrills like electric fire—“Independence!” Let us wander through the crowd, in front of the State House, and see the varying passions painted on each face, and listen to the whispers until we feel our hearts swell with the same interest that fills every bosom. Oh, the eloquence of those women's faces, the stern anxiety of those patriot looks! Hark! A murmur swells through the crowd, you see it surging far from the walls of the State House, away to the trees, that rise on either hand. There is a sound in yonder avenue, the tread of many feet—listen! that murmur, “Congress has closed its session, and the work is done!” Then from that door, with massive pillars, come forth one by one, the members of the solemn council. How the smile upon their faces flashes through the crowd! First, while other Delegates mingle with the crowd and answer their hurried questions, a gentleman of mild appearance, yet with a bold brow and keen eye, comes to the verge of the steps, and stretches forth his hands. Every eye in the crowd beholds his dark attire, relieved by cambric ruffles and lace of gold, for the gentleman is one of Boston's stout-hearted merchant princes. From lip to lip, the murmur runs, “John Hancock, the President!” And as he stretched forth his left hand, holding a parchment in his right, you see Franklin standing with uncovered brow, the foremost of the group at his back, with the sunlight playing on his animated face. That form, tall and angular, leaning with one hand behind the back, the other raised to the heart, against the pillar on the right side of the door, while the face, with the eyes sunken beneath the downdrawn brows, the nether lip compressed, the nerves quivering with an emotion, not the less deep because it is scarce perceptible. It is Thomas Jefferson. Never king upon his throne, never conqueror on the battle-field felt a deeper joy than thrilled his bosom then! Glorious Prophet of the Rights of Man, how my heart beats, as through the mists of seventy-one years, I survey you, standing there, against the right pillar of the State House door, with the sunshine streaming over your glowing face! Stout-hearted John Adams stands between him and Franklin, his face beaming as he rests his hand on Jefferson's arm, and converses with him, repeating the word which swells every heart—Independence! Between the heads of Jefferson and Adams, you see the face of Livingston, while leaning against the left pillar, Roger Sherman gazes on the scene. Hancock stretches forth his hand— An old soldier, battered with cuts and scars, hobbles up to the foot of the steps, and with the marks of the Indian wars and Bunker Hill upon his face, gasps the words, “Well, President, is it all right?” There is silence in that breathless crowd. Every ear in the throng hears his reply, spoken in calm, conversational tones. “It is! This day we have signed our Declaration of Independence! To-morrow it will be published in the Gazette, and on the eighth day of July, proclaimed from the State House steps. From this day there are no Colonies, but States. From this day there is no British dominion, but the Republic of the United States of America!” Did you ever see a bolt of lightning stream in one red mass from the zenith, and then scatter in a thousand rays of fire, over the tree-tops of an undulating wood? So these words rush into every heart, and burst upon the crowd, scattering their rays in every heart. The crowd is terribly still for a moment, and then the murmur swells into a shout. At this moment, a little boy, whose golden hair tosses about his rosy cheeks, steals up the steps and clutches the President by the knee, and whispers—“The old man in the steeple sent me down, to ask you whether he should ring the bell? Shall I say ring?” Hancock pressed his hands upon the head of the child, and said—“You will live to see the day, my child, when the voice of that bell will have been heard by all the world! Tell the old man to ring!” Through the crowd brave boy! Out into the street, and clap your tiny hands until the old man in yonder steeple hears you. Look! with his bronzed face and snow white hair, he bends from the steeple, he sees that child, with flushed cheeks and golden hair, clap his hands, he hears that boyish shout—“Ring!” Then the old man bared his arm, and the bell on which was written—“Proclaim liberty to the land, and all the inhabitants thereof,” spoke to the city, to the People, to a world in chains. As the tones of that bell go swinging over the city, let us look upon the strange tumultuous panorama in front of the State House, now known forever as Independence Hall. It is a picture, or rather a combination of pictures, worthy of the artist's pencil, but which requires the pen of Jefferson or the voice of Patrick Henry to describe. It resolves itself into three prominent points of view. First, the group on the left of the hall door. An Indian stands with his back towards us, in the act of stepping toward a group whom he surveys, his rich blanket, revealing the bold outline of his right shoulder, and drooping in rainbow hues to the ground. His face — but partly seen in its marked profile, is turned slightly to the left, while over his brow waves the plume of snowy feathers, and down to his shoulders streams that mass of straight black hair. The group on which he gazes! Do you see that young man, attired in a rich dark dress, bending with uncovered brow, before a beautiful girl, who clings to the arm of an aged man? Her young face blooming with the fullness of life and love, is surmounted by a slight bonnet that crowns her flowing hair; her beautiful neck and white shoulders, and a glimpse of her virgin bosom, glow in the light of the fading day. Her form is clad in a flowing dress of plain white, that waves from the bosom to the feet, while the arm, around whose half-bared outlines flutters a silken shawl, points to the Presi dent's form, as it rises above the crowd, in front of those massive pillars. The light which blazes from the young man's eye is reflected in the joyous sunshine of her face. That look, flashing from face to face, tells the whole story. “This is better”—exclaimed the Rose of Wissahikon— “much better than last night!” “To you,” cried Reginald, with the blood rising to his face; To you, I owe the share which I have taken in the glorious deed of this day. If the name of Reginald Landsdowne, of St. Leonard's, goes down to posterity as a `Signer of the Declaration,' the merit of his fame belongs to the—Rose of Wissahikon!” And while the noble Indian contemplates with calm satisfaction this group—his sister, his father, and the husband of that sister—look yonder, over the shoulder of Reginald, and see that face, lowering with malignant passions, livid with crushed hopes, the clenched hand raised to the chin, the cold, dead eye turning from these glowing faces with hatred and fury. It is Gerald Moynton, the sister of the Idiot Woman, Lady Marion; the minion of the King. The second forms of interest, in fact the centre of the picture, directly in front of the Statehouse door — Three figures, standing in a group, and talking earnestly of the great Declaration. One, with his back to the Indian, his bold profile turned towards us, his hand pressed to his side, grasping a paper, with a book beneath his arm. A long brown coat reaches to his knees. You see, in the outlines of his face, the stamp of a strong genius. The dark eye flashes a fire which kings have felt, and trembled for their thrones. There is a mocking scorn upon his lip, which has made the tools of power writhe more than once. Altogether, his attitude, his face, impress us with a deep interest in this man. Thomas Paine, the author-hero of the Revolution! That book beneath his arm, “Common Sense,” produced the “Declaration,” a rude draft of which he grasps in his hand.* * By the united testimony of Washington, Jefferson, Franklin, Ramsay, Rush, and Barlow, the vital agency of Paine, in this great work, is affirmed. With that full, large eye flashing with the consciousness of genius, he surveys the form of Robert Morris, who stands opposite, holding hat and cane in one hand, while he extends the other to Benjamin Rush, and congratules him on the fulfilment of the great work. “This is a great day!” he said—this patriot without a stain, —this banker without a fault. “Yes, a glorious day!” You see Rush, in the earnestness of his thoughts, raise the left hand, grasping his cane, while his calm face glows, and his eyes fixed on the air, seem glancing into the future. “The children of unborn time will behold its perfect work. It is to you, Paine, we owe it! The book, which you first suggested to me—which I besought you to write —which you wrote and scattered to the world, startled the country into thought, and wrote `Independence' in every honest heart!” As we survey these three men, their faces warmed by the same glow, let us remember the manner in which they died. Paine—having forsaken that Bible, from which he gleaned the truths of “Common Sense”—died a miserable and heart-broken man. Morris, whose financial genius saved his country in her darkest hour, died in a common jail, to which the holy law of “imprisonment for debt”—which yet obtains in some savage communities—consigned him. Rush alone, calm and serene, rich in the fame of science and humanity, died in his home. Passing this group, we come to the third form of interest. A confused crowd, stretching away under the shade of these trees, moving to and fro, gesticulating earnestly, as they conversed on the great topic of the hour. Here, a fiery patriot raises his arm, as if to strike a calm-faced Tory, who doubts the expediency of the means. “It is not yet time, thee sees, my friend.” “Time! Zounds, sir, it never will be time, so long as we permit traitors like you to prowl the streets!” Thus strolling through the crowd, we may see every variety of expression—every change of countenance; the hearts of men glow in their faces—speak not only in their words, but in the upraised arm and significant finger. And, all the while, that group upon the steps rises above the crowd, the object of every eye, their faces revealed by the light which flashes from the west; Hancock, the President, foremost in the group, while Jefferson leans against the pillar, and the compatriots cluster round. And all the while, with a peal and a clang, the bell spoke out, saying to the kings on their thrones—and, of all kings, to the weak and wicked George of England—“Doom! doom! doom!” Then changing its peal, it spoke to man, whether in workshop or the mine—whether toil in the field or bleeding in the battle, and the word, that it said, as the sun went down, was still—“Dawn! dawn! dawn!” Doom to kings—the night of death! Dawn to man—the day-break of freedom! Thus, as the sun went down, the glorious Liberty-bell rang at once a curse and blessing on the solemn close of the Fourth of July. President Hancock advanced through the crowd, and confronted the White Indian, as he towered in the pride of his forest stature. “I have heard your story. How, stolen when a child from the ruined home of your father, you were reared at once by the Indians, an Indian like themselves; and, by an American colonist who had forsaken society for the turmoil of savage life, in all the knowledge of the white race. I know your heart! You would serve your country—serve Washington?” “Mayaniko lives but to serve the great chief!” said the White Indian, as he stood in the presence of his father, Reginald, and the Rose of Wissahikon. “Speak the word, and it is done!” “Will you ride an hundred miles or more to-night? Take this parchment,” and he drew near the Indian, and whispered a few words—“The horse stands ready for you across the river, in Cooper's woods. To-night,” he said aloud, “you must seek the camp of Washington!” At once gathering his blanket about his form, the Indian turned, and, with the parchment to his breast, without a word of farewell to father or sister, hurried to the river side. “Now,” said Reginald, as he took Rose, in all her beauty, from her father's arm—“Now, we must away to the home that wooes us with its smile, the Cottage Home of Wissahikon!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE LAST. THE MESSENGER OF FREEDOM. Upon the river a boat glided like an arrow toward the eastern shore, while the last flush of day is in the sky—the last smile of light on the waters. In that boat, you see the form of Mayaniko, wielding the oar that hisses through the waves, as he fixes his eye on the distant woods. Away, away—the sunlight's last gleam upon your face, brave Indian! Away, away—with the sacred parchment near your heart! Away, away—for you have a hundred miles to ride, ere the rising of the morrow's sun. “To the Camp—to the Camp of Washington!” The boat glides into that quiet cove, overhung with boughs and flowers. Not a moment passes ere his foot is on the shore. He leaves the boat, and hurries into the wood. There a magnificent white horse, arrayed in splendid caparisons, awaits him. At once the Indian unbuckles the splendid saddle, dashes it on the ground, and, with his blanket waving all around him, leaps on the bare back of the steed. He threads the mazes of the wood, and, just as the night comes down, emerges on the public road. Some farmers, returning from their daily toil, behold that white horse and his Indian rider dashing toward them, and shrink back amazed. “The Camp of Washington?” cried the Indian, bending over the neck of his horse. They point the way, and he is gone. The night comes down—the stars flash out—and still be hurries on. The steed seems to feel its precious burden—seems to know that it bears a warrior form and a sacred parchment, and, with its eye gleaming through the night, thunders away. One hundred miles before the rising of the sun—ten miles an hour, with scarce a moment's rest—a second's delay! A brave thing to do, gallant war-horse; and a deed that will cost you your life. Now, in the shadows of a glen—now on the ascent of a hill— now in sight of the broad river, with its opposite bank lined with gardens and flowers. Still the Indian hurries on! The only word that he speaks, as he rushes into the view of the belated wayfarer is—The Camp, the Camp of Washington! The only way in which his dark eye gazes, is to the north, for there they say it lies, there miles on miles away, the Camp of Washington! At last, in the old town of Trenton—which six months afterward became the scene of Washington's last hope—he reins the white steed, surrounded by a crowd who hurry from their doors with torches in their hands. They gaze in wonder upon the panting horse; this tall rider, with his straight dark hair, lined with a coronal of snow-white feathers, and the blanket of many colors floating from his shoulders. You may see them stand in the street, circling round Wayaniko, the lights above their head, the dark town all around. “The way,” he cries—“the way to the camp of Washington!” He sees their extended hands; that space in the street is vacant; far through the night clatters the sound of hoofs, and gleams the vision of the white steed and his Indian rider. The moon rises, the hours glide, Princeton and Brunswick are passed. The Raritan gleams far behind in the light of the moon. The road rises over rocks and hills, then the Indian messenger is lost in the bosom of thick woods. Still the brave horse, urged to his utmost speed, bathed all over with foam, bounds from the earth and skims along. The moon rises! Slowly up yonder hill, rugged with crags, dark with pines, the white horse toils along, his master's blanket fluttering down his flanks. Not once is that Indian's face turned back; still his dark eye to the north, still he looks for the camp of Washington. The moon rises! A flying cloud overspreads it with a veil. Down into the hollow where the brook boils beneath the trembling bridge; down into the stream with the cool water flowing round the limbs of the panting steed. For a moment he pauses, suffers the horse to wet his nostrils and his mouth in the grateful current, and then presses his flanks with his knee and bids him on! As the cloud rolls from the moon, do you see that wide meadow, its sea of grass waving in the clear light, with the white horse dashing over its surface, while the Indian towers erect on his back, the war blanket fluttering far behind him! The moon sinks from her throne in the zenith. Down through the clouds that float about her, down through the blue vault until her horizental rays tremble faintly over the wide expanse of hills and valleys. Along the dark wood where log huts rise among the pines, the white horse thunders now. Panting, foaming, his mane waving in the cool breeze, he glides along, while the blood begins to mingle with the froth around his nostrils. Look! A crowd of dark forms overspread the road; you see their rifles rise, their knives gleam. Tories, in the garb of soldiers; their challenge rings out upon the night. “Who goes there?” But the White Indian does not reply. Hark! the crack of rifles; a cloud of smoke rolls round his form. He does not look behind, nor turn to either side; the bullet grazes the tiger skin about his breast, but the sacred parchment is safe. He dashes on, while the Tories, gazing upon his retreating form, hear the deep words—“The Camp of Washington!” The moon goes down. Pale and dim, her disc, half seen, trembles over the distant woods, before it sinks to darkness. The night grows dark. We have lost sight of Mayaniko; ah, the horse has fallen, the rider pants exhausted by the roadside! Is it so? Look yonder through this gloom that gathers so dark before the break of day, and fix your eyes upon the summit of that steep hill. On one side a wood—you see it extend, a darkening mass. On the other a level field, overspread with waving wheat. A rude hut built among the trees, gives forth from its window a glare of light. The plain cottager has risen; he is about to begin his day's toil. He comes forth and stands before his home, a brawny man, with a coarse dress on his broad chest, the marks of toil upon his face. But what sight is this that meets his eyes in the dimness of the daybreak hour? Writhing in the roadside bank, his nostrils flooding the dust with blood, a noble white horse stretches out his limbs, raises his head, quivers along his flanks, and then is still. Over him stands a form, which fills the rough laborer with awe. Into the hut he passes, returns with a light, shading its rays with the palm of his hand, he approaches, and beholds an Indian standing with folded arms beside the dying horse. The heart of the noble beast has burst—look! how its warm blood pours in a torrent over the road. The Indian stands with folded arms, his head sunken and his eyes fixed upon the steed. As the cottager surveys that form, with the war blanket drooping from the shoulders, the coronal of feathers waving over the dark hair, he starts back with awe. For the last time the dying horse lifts his head and fixes his eye upon his master's form. Then all is over; he lays there, dead. The Indian turns— “The Camp of Washington?” he cries with a voice that makes the cottager start. “Look yonder!” exclaims the laborer, as the wind extinguishes his light. There, from the summit of the hill, the Indian looks and sees, a wide expanse of waters heaving in the dim light of the day-break sky—a black mass, like a wall of ebony, extending along the distant horizon. That expanse of waters, the waves of Manhattan Bay—that wall of ebony the City of New York. “A boat? A canoe?” “There aint none within three miles”—hesitates the cottager. At once the resolution of the Indian is taken; at once he flings the blanket from his shoulders, the tiger-skin from his breast, and stands there naked to the waist, disclosing a form, magnificent in its broad chest and boldly defined muscles. He winds the parchment in the locks of his long straight hair; secures it with a cord; and while the plume waves over his brow, hurries to the river. A footstep on the sand, a sudden plunge— Long before the threshold of his home, stood the cottager, watching that white plume gleaming from the blackness of the waves. Through the shadows of a spacious chamber, struggled the rays of a taper, its waning light imparting a deeper gloom to the massive furniture, the cumbrous hangings and the curtained bed. A man of some forty-five years, whose muscular limbs were clad in a long dark dressing gown, had sunk to sleep in an arm-chair, after many weary hours of labor. His hand resting on the table, still grasped the pen, which marked the unfinished sentence of his letter. By that hand a sheathed sword; over that table a mass of papers, bearing the name of great men, and involving the fate of a nation. And as this tired soldier slept, the light flickered lower in the socket and the first gleam of day came through the parted curtains. Suddenly a cry was heard, the tramp of a footstep! At the very instant the soldier awoke from his sleep, started to his feet, and listened. That footstep grew nearer, the door was flung open, a strange form stood on the threshold, bared to the waist, and dripping from the dark hair to the moccasined feet with spray. Yes it was a noble form, with bold features, and large eyes, that now rolled wildly in their sockets. Over the brow of this strange apparition, waved a coronal of snow-white plumes. The soldier started with surprise, and pressed his hands over his eyes, as though he beheld the vision of a dream. But the figure tottered forward, tore a parchment from the locks of his dark hair, and as he held it aloft, fell like a dead man to the floor. The soldier bent down and grasped the parchment, and hurrying to the window, unclosed it before the first beam of the rising day. By that beam of morning light, George Washington, with a quickening pulse and kindling eye, perused the Declaration of Independence. — And the same dawn that shone on his brow, shone through the cottage home by the still waters, on the sleeping form of the bride, whose lips parted in a smile, as in a dream, she saw the dangers that had passed, the trials that had once darkened her life— The Rose of Wissahikon.</field>
