      <field name="fulltext">VOL. II. B REDWOOD. CHAPTER X. They're here that kens and here that disna ken, The wimpled meaning o' your unco tale, Whilk soon will make a noise o'er muir and dale. Ramsay's Gentle Shepherd. Those only who have observed the magical effect produced upon a young lady by the presence of a candidate for her favour, whom she deems it worth her efforts to obtain or retain, can have an adequate notion of the change wrought on Caroline Redwood since the arrival of the Westalls. Instead of the listless, sullen girl, who yawned away her days in discontent or apathy, she became spirited, active, and good-humoured. Even her interest in the concerns of Ellen Bruce, and her suspicions of that artless girl's designs, were suspended in the ardour of her present pursuit, and she seemed to think of nothing and to care for nothing but how she should secure the triumph of her vanity. Every one noticed the change; (excepting Ellen, who had of late almost wholly withdrawn from the family circle) indeed, it was so manifest that Miss Deborah, who had taken a decided dislike to Caroline, and who was rather remarkable for the inveteracy of her opinions, was heard to say, that “since the girl's sweetheart had come, she was as bright as a September day after the fog was lifted; but for her part she liked to see people have sunshine within them like Ellen.” This declaration was made by Miss Debby in an imprudently loud tone of voice, as she stood at a window gazing on Mr. Redwood's carriage that had been ordered for an afternoon's drive. Mr. Redwood, Caroline, and Mrs. Westall were B 2 already in the carriage, and Charles Westall had returned to the parlour in quest of some article Mr. Redwood had forgotten; while he was looking for it, Deborah's comment fell on his ear, and probably gave a new direction to his thoughts, for during the ride Caroline rallied him on his extraordinary pensiveness; and finally perceiving that his gravity resisted all her efforts to dissipate it, she proposed that if he had not lost the use of his limbs as well as of his tongue, he should alight from the carriage with her and walk to a cottage, to which they perceived a direct path through a field, while the carriage approached by the high road which ran along the lake shore and was circuitous. Westall assented rather with politeness than eagerness; but when he was alone with Caroline, when she roused all her powers to charm him, he yielded to the influence of her beauty and her vivacity. Never had she appeared so engaging— never so beautiful—the afternoon was delicious—their path ran along the skirts of an enchanting wood—its soft shadows fell over them, the birds poured forth their melody; and, in short, all nature conspired to stimulate the lover's imagination and to quicken his sensibility. Charles forgot the sage resolutions he had made to withhold his declaration till he had satisfied certain doubts that had sometimes obtruded on him, that all in Caroline was not as fair and lovely as it seemed; he forgot Miss Deborah's hint —forgot every thing but the power and the presence of his beautiful companion, and only hesitated for language to express what his eyes had already told her. At this moment both his and Miss Redwood's attention was withdrawn from themselves to a little girl who appeared at the door of the cottage, from which they were now not many yards distant. On perceiving them she bounded over the door step, then stopped, put up her hand to shade her eyes from the sun, and gazed fixedly on them for a moment, then again sprang forward, again stopped, covered her eyes with both her hands, threw herself at full length on the grass, laid her ear to the ground and seemed for a moment to listen intently; she then rose, put her apron to her eyes and appeared to be weeping, while she retraced her way languidly to the cottage. Caroline and Westall, moved by the same impulse, quickened their pace, and in a few moments reached the cottage door, to which a woman had been attracted by the sobs of the child, and was expostulating with her in an earnest tone. “God help us, Peggy, you'll just ruin all if you go on in this way;” she paused on perceiving that the child had attracted the attention of the strangers; and in reply to Westall's asking what ailed the little girl, she said, “it's just her simplicity, Sir; but if you and the lady will condescend to walk into my poor place here, I will tell you all about it, or Peggy shall tell it herself, for when she gets upon it her tongue runs faster than mine: but bless me, here comes a grand coach—look up, Peggy, you never saw a real coach in your life.” Peggy now let fall the apron with which she had covered her face—a face if not beautiful, full of feeling and intelligence. She seemed instantly to forget her affliction, whatever it was, in the pleasure of gazing on the spectacle of the real coach. “Ah, aunt Betty,” she exclaimed, “it is the grand sick gentleman that is staying at Mr. Lenox's.” The carriage drew up to the door, and Mrs. Westall and Mr. Redwood, attracted by the uncommonly neat appearance of the cottage, alighted and followed Caroline and Charles, who had already entered it. The good woman, middle-aged and of a cheerful countenance, was delighted with the honour conferred on her, bustled around to furnish seats for her guests— shook up the cushion of a rocking chair for Mr. Redwood, and made a thousand apologies for the confusion and dirt of her house, which had the usual if not the intended effect of calling forth abundance of compliments on its perfect order and neatness. “And now, Peggy,” she said, as soon as they were all quietly seated, “take the pitcher and bring some cold water from the spring, that's what the poor have, thank God, as good as the rich, and it is all we have to offer.” The little girl obeyed, and as soon as she was out of hearing, the woman turned to Westall. “It was your wish, Sir, to know what ailed the child; the poor thing has just got the use of her eyesight, and she has been expecting some one that she loves better than all the world; and when she saw this young lady with you, she thought it was her friend—though to be sure she is shorter than this lady; but then Peggy, poor thing, does not see quite right yet, and then when she is puzzled she just lies down to the ground as you saw her, for that was her way to listen, and she knows Miss Ellen's step, for as light as it is, when my poor ear can't hear a sound.” “How did she become blind, my good woman, and how did she recover her sight?” asked Westall. “It is a long story, Sir: when she was one year old, she laid in the measles, and her mother dying at the same time, and I sick of a fever, and the child, God forgive me, was neglected, and there came a blind over her eyes, and shut them up in darkness.” “Not all darkness,” said the little heroine of the story, who reentered with the water, “you know, aunt Betty, I could see a glimmer of sunshine.” “Yes, and that it was that gave the doctor hopes of her.” “No, no,” interrupted the child, “it was Miss Ellen that gave the doctor hopes.” “Lord bless her,” continued the woman, smiling, “Peggy thinks there's B 3 nothing good done in the world, but Miss Ellen does it, and to be sure she has been an angel to Peggy.” “And how,” asked Mr. Redwood, whose interest in Peggy's history seemed much augmented since the mention of Miss Ellen, “how came Miss Bruce to know your child?” “God brought them together, Sir; it was his own work; but the child is not mine, her poor mother lies in the graveyard there in the village, far from all her own people, for we are from old England, Sir. My sister, poor Fanny, was a wild thing, the youngest of ten of us, and I the oldest. My mother died and left her a baby in my arms; and she was like my own, and we all, and father more than all, petted her, and when she was sixteen, she had just her own way, and married a young soldier lad of our village, and my father turned her from his door, and would not hear to forgiving her. But I, Lord help me! I had no right not to forgive her; and so I came over to Canada with her when her husband's regiment was ordered there. I had a little money of my own, and we paid our own way, but when that was gone, our distresses and hardships threw her in the consumption. Her husband got into bad company, deserted and came off to the States; we followed—she with the baby—Peggy that is—in her arms. We persuaded her husband to take this bit of a place, but he soon left us, and, as I told you before, Fanny died, and left me alone in the world, as you may say, with Peggy—and she blind; but, Sir, I have always been of a contented disposition, and I meant to be resigned to whatever it pleased the Lord to send upon me; but I must own, when I found Peggy was blind, and the doctors told me nothing could be done for her, I had my match. It was the bitterest sorrow I ever felt when life was spared, but I thought to myself, what can't be cured must be endured; so I went to work. The Lord has blessed us, and Peggy and I have lived these six years as comfortable and as contented may be as those that are richer, and seem to be happier.” “No doubt, no doubt, my good woman,” said Mr. Redwood, struck with admiration of the simple creature's practical philosophy; “but you have told us so much of your story that you must give us the rest.” “Yes, yes,” said little Peggy, “do, aunt Betty, tell them about Miss Ellen, they'll like to hear that best of all: now don't go away,” said she, turning to Caroline, who had risen from her chair, and was walking towards the door. “I am not going away, child,” she answered, pettishly, “I prefer standing at the door.” “It is five weeks to-morrow,” continued the narrator, “since I first saw Miss Ellen; it was the very morning after young Mr. Allen's funeral. I saw her that morning and the next sitting on that rock by the elm tree yonder, ladies; she had a pencil in her hand, and a big book on her lap, and a paper on it; and the second morning Peggy heard her humming some songs to herself, and she crept close to her: the silly thing would any time leave her breakfast for an end of a song. I saw the young lady noticed Peggy, and then I made bold to walk up to her; and will you believe me, ladies! she had been picturing on her paper this little hut and the half withered tree, and that old bench with my washtub turned up on it, and my old cow, as she stands eating her morning mess, and Peggy stroking her! and I could not but ask her why she did not choose to draw out some of the nice houses in the village with two chimnies, and a square roof to them, and a pretty fence to the dooryard, and the straight tall poplars; but she smiled, and said `this suited her fancy better;' and then she began talking to me of Peggy, and when she found she was quite blind, she just laid down her pencil and her book and all, and took the child in her lap, and said, `something must be done for her;' and when she said so, the tears stood in her blue eyes; and God knows, I never saw tears so becoming; and from that time, ladies, she came every morning, and sate here three or four hours, teaching Peggy to sew, and learning her hymns and songs.” “Caroline, Caroline, do you hear that?” asked Mr. Redwood, impetuously. “Lord, papa, I am not deaf—certainly I hear.” “Go on, good woman,” said Mr. Redwood. “The child's quickness, Sir,” continued the aunt, “seemed a miracle to me; for, God forgive me, I had never thought of her learning anything. Peggy, get those bags you made that Miss Ellen said you might sell.” The child instantly produced the bags, which were made of pieces of calico very neatly sewn together. Caroline interrupted the story while she bargained with the little girl for the bags, for which she paid her most munificently. The aunt seemed more sensible of the extent of Miss Redwood's generosity than the child, for she was voluble in her thanks; and then proceeded to say that Miss Ellen, not satisfied with doing so much, brought Doctor Bristol to look at Peggy's eyes. “Doctor Bristol,” she said, “had come to live in Eton since she had given up Peggy's eyes as quite gone, and therefore she had never shown the child to him. But Doctor Bristol had learned some new fashioned ways that other doctors in the country knew nothing about, and as soon as he looked at the child, he said one of the eyes might be restored. Then poor Peggy was so frightened with the thought of an operation, and I could do nothing with her, for I had always let her have her own way; for who, ladies, could have the heart to cross a blind child? but Miss Ellen, God bless her, could always make her mind without crossing her, for she loves Miss Ellen better than any thing on earth, or in heaven either, I fear me; and she would liken her to strawberries and roses, and every thing that was most pleasant to the senses the poor thing had left—and she would say that her voice was sweeter than the music of the birds, or the sound of the waters breaking on the shore, when a gentle breeze came over the lake of a still evening, for that was the sound she loved best of all, and would listen to it sometimes for an hour together without speaking or moving.” It seemed that Miss Redwood's patience could no longer brook the minute and excursive style of the narrator, as she proposed to Mrs. Westall in a whisper, that they should cut the woman's never-ending story short and pursue their ride. Mrs. Westall acquiesced, with a `just as you please, my dear;' but Mr. Redwood, guessing the purport of his daughter's whisper, interposed with a request in a low voice, that she would not prolong their delay by interrupting the good woman's story, as the pain in his arm warned him that it was time for him to return; then turning to the aunt, he asked her “how she brought the girl finally to consent to the operation?” “Oh, it was Miss Ellen that made her consent, and she would only do it by promising that she would stay by her and hold her head. God knows I could not have done it, well as I love her, to have saved her eyes, for I was all in a shiver when I saw the doctor fix her by that window, and Miss Ellen stood behind her, and Peggy leaned her head back on to Miss Ellen's breast, and one of Miss Ellen's hands was on the child's forehead, and the other under her chin, and she looked, God bless her, as white as marble, and as beautiful as an angel. I had but a glance at them, for when the doctor took out his long needle I covered my eyes till I heard them say it was all over, and Peggy had not made a movement or a groan. Miss Ellen bade me not to speak yet, and the bandage was put over the child's eyes, and she was laid there on the bed, and Miss Ellen motioned to me to go out with her, and as I stepped from the door, she sunk like a dying person into my arms; but still it seemed she could only think of Peggy, for she put up her hand for a sign to me to be quiet, and then the breath seemed quite gone out of her. I laid her on the turf and fetched some cold water, and she soon came to herself, and bade me say nothing of it to the doctor; and she came in again and told the doctor she should come back in the evening and sit the night with Peggy, for she would trust no one else for the first night, for the doctor said all depended on keeping her quiet; and the last word she said, was to beg he would not tell any of the family at Mr. Lenox's that she was coming here, for they, she said, fancied she was not well, and would not permit it.” At this simple explanation of the absence which Caroline had placed in a suspicious light, her father turned on her a look full of meaning—she blushed deeply, but neither spoke, and the aunt proceeded. “All went on well to the third day, and then Miss Ellen came with leave to take off the bandage, and she asked Peggy what she wished most in the world to see. “Oh you, you, Miss Ellen,” she said; and then the dear young lady stood before her, and took off the bandage; and then, bless you, ladies, her piercing scream of joy when the light touched her eye—oh!—I heard my father curse poor Fanny—I saw her die in a strange land; but never any thing went so deep into my heart as that scream. I fell on my knees, and heard nothing and saw nothing, till I felt Peggy's arms round my neck, and heard her say, `Oh aunt, I see her—I see you.”' Many more eloquent tales have produced less sensation than the simple story of this good aunt. Mrs. Westall wiped the tears from her eyes—Caroline put her handkerchief to hers—Mr. Redwood's speaking face showed that other and deeper feelings than compassion and sympathy had been awakened; and Charles, who had drawn the little girl close to him, asked a hundred questions in relation to Miss Bruce, and expressed by his caresses his pleasure in her simple expressions of gratitude and love. The party now took a very kind leave of Peggy and her aunt, and returned home; all in rather a contemplative frame of mind. Mr. Redwood once turned abruptly to his daughter, and asked her if she remembered the quotation he had made to her, that the `simplest characters sometimes baffle all the art of decipherers?' “She remembered it,” she said, “but she thought simple characters were not worth deciphering.” After they reached home, the ceremony of tea came in aid of Caroline's efforts, and changed the train of association, and seconded by Mrs. Westall, she succeeded in exciting a more lively tone of spirits in the party; but fate seemed determined not to suspend its persecutions, for after tea, when she seemed quite to have forgotten the incidents of the ride, and her gaiety had arrived to its usual pitch, it was suddenly checked by Miss Deborah, who came into the parlour and informed Mr. Redwood “that Billy Raymond, the lame boy that supported his old mother by fishing, had called to see if the stranger gentleman would have the generosity to pay him the damages for his fishingtackle, that Miss Redwood had lost at the time of her frolic in his canoe?” This was the first time Mr. Redwood had heard any hint of the canoe adventure, and he inquired into the particulars. Caroline carelessly detailed them, and Mr. Redwood ascertaining from Deborah the amount of the boy's loss, gave her a sum for the applicant which she deemed a most liberal compensation; for shaking the silver in her hand, while her eye glistened with an honest joy at the good fortune of her protegé— “Thank'e, thank'e, squire,” said she, “this is profit, and no loss to Bill—the lad is a worthy lad, and thank the Lord his bread has not been cast on the waters without coming to him again. It is well, young folks,” she continued, turning her eyes on Miss Redwood and Westall, “it is well when the heart and the purse of a gentleman fall in company —here,” and she opened her hand and surveyed the glittering coins, “here is what will make a young heart leap with joy—and an old one too, and that is not so easy a matter—and after all, squire, it is but a drop from your full bucket. Oh, you rich ones might be god-like on the earth if ye would.” “And how, Miss Debby?” inquired Mr. Redwood, pleased with her earnestness; “if you will furnish me an easy rule I may possibly adopt it.” “Make the cause of the poor thine own: the rule is not overly easy, squire, as maybe you have found. It is a hard tug to keep up with them scripter rules, they are all a-head of us.” “Miss Deborah's sagacity or experience,” observed Westall to Mr. Redwood, “has led her to one of the most satisfactory proofs of the divine origin of our religion.” Mr. Redwood averted his eyes, knit his brow, and adjusted the sling of his arm, while Caroline putting up her fan to shelter herself from her father's observation, whispered, “Lord, Mr. Westall, do you not know that papa is an infidel?” “Your father?” “Oh yes—it is indeed quite shocking,” —how far the sudden gravity of Westall's face would have prompted her to proceed in her lamentations, is uncertain, for her attention was called by her father, who willing to divert the conversation from the channel into which it had fallen, asked her why she had never mentioned the affair of the canoe to him? “Oh, I quite forgot it, Sir,” she replied, “in my pleasure at seeing Mrs. Westall”— and her son, her eyes added, as she sent a sparkling glance to Charles. Her reply did not appear entirely to satisfy Westall, even with the flattering appendage to which her kind look had supplied; after musing a moment he said, “I hope Miss Redwood has not forgotten her friend's presence of mind on that occasion?” “Miss Bruce's? — certainly not — though it deprived me of the romance of being rescued by you, Mr. Westall, which you know would have been quite an incident for a novel.” “I don't know about incidents,” said Debby, who was arrested as she was leaving the room by the allusion to Ellen, “but I think if any body had saved me from the accident of being drowned or ducked, I should not have left it to other folks to tell of it.” There was one unsuspected and most unwilling auditor of this conversation— Ellen Bruce. She had been indulging herself with the refreshment of a short walk, and was just re-entering the door, and lingering to gaze on the dewy landscape glittering in the moon-beams, when her ear caught Charles Westall's inquiry in relation to herself: she was awkwardly situated, for she could not advance without being observed, nor remain without being an involuntary listener to a conversation that seemed now to have turned upon herself. While she was hesitating, Mr. Redwood inquired of Debby “why Miss Bruce latterly confined herself so much to Mrs. Allen's room?” VOL. II. C “Why,” said Deborah, “the fact is, that the old lady is broke to pieces with her troubles, and the moment Ellen is out of her sight she moans for her like a child whimpering for its mother: we all try to spell her, but none of us can do any thing right but Ellen: it is past all belief what she does for the old lady—it is enough to wear out the strength of Sampson. I talk to Mrs. Allen, but she is quite past hearing to reason, though there was never a nicer reasonabler woman than she has been in her day.” “It is quite surprising,” observed Caroline, languidly to Mrs. Westall, “what labours these New England women perform.” “Surprising indeed,” echoed Mrs. Westall, “but it's all in habit, my dear.” “New-England women—habit!” exclaimed Deborah; “I'll tell you what— it is not being born here or there, it is not habit; it is not strength of limb, but here,” and she struck her hand against her heart, “here is what gives Ellen Bruce strength and patience.” There was energy if not eloquence in Deborah's manner, and Charles Westall, who had listened to the conversation from the beginning, with an interest that had manifestly nettled Caroline, inquired “what relation Mrs. Allen bore to Miss Bruce?” “None,” replied Deborah, and then seeming suddenly to recollect that the fisherman was awaiting her, she left the room. “This is an uncommon devotion on the part of Miss Bruce,” said Westall; “but after what we have heard this afternoon it cannot surprise us—there is something singularly pure and lovely in her whole expression and manner, in perfect unison with her disinterested conduct.” “She is indeed quite a genteel young woman,” observed Mrs. Westall. “Pray, Miss Redwood, how is she connected with the Lenoxes?” “Not at all as far as I can ascertain,” C 2 replied Caroline. “She seems to be quite as mysterious a personage as the man in the iron mask. I have tried in vain to find out whether she has, or ever had, father or mother, brethren or sisters —and I have finally come to the conclusion, that she is, as you know, papa, old Colonel Linston used to call such people, of the Melchisedeck family.” There was a harshness, a levity bordering on impiety in Miss Redwood's reply; it sent a sudden light in upon Charles Westall's mind. He had been amusing himself with drawing and undrawing the strings of Caroline's reticule —he threw it aside, not with that lover-like manner that resembles so much the profound reverence with which the priest handles the consecrated vessels, but very carelessly—and left the room. In the passage he met Ellen, who on his approach had darted forward in the hope of avoiding him. It was impossible— and it was apparent that she had overheard the conversation—her face was flushed and her manner troubled—her eye met Westall's: a single glance intimated the suffering of the one and the indignant feeling of the other—their fine spirits had been kindled by the same spark—it was one of those moments when the soul sends its bright illuminations to the face, and does not need the intervention of language. Ellen's first impulse had been to pass to her own apartment, but Westall's look had changed the current of her feelings— such is the power of sympathy. “Stay one moment, Mr. Westall,” said she, hastily entering Mr. Redwood's apartment, while Westall paused at the door. Her appearance was electrifying—Caroline rose from her seat, Mr. Redwood exclaimed, “good heavens!” and Mrs. Westall signed out, “what a pity!” “Miss Redwood,” said Ellen, “I have not come to excuse my listening, that was involuntary, but as far as I am able, to shield the memory of my mother from your reckless insinuations.” The word “mother,” seemed to choke her; a sudden faintness came over her, and she clung for support to the side of the easychair on which Mr. Redwood was sitting: after a moment's struggle with her feelings, the blood that had retreated to her heart flowed again to her cheeks, and she went on:— “Miss Redwood, it is true I am a solitary being in this world, but I have not sought to wrap myself in mystery; I hoped the obscurity of my condition would shelter me from observation and curiosity—it has not—there may be mystery in my brief story, but there is no disgrace. My mother died while I was still an infant. I only know that my father survived her—and that he was—her husband.” Here Ellen's voice quite failed her, but after a moment's pause she proceeded with tolerable composure. “This was her last solemn declaration. The proofs of her marriage and other private documents are in my hands, in a locked casket. It was my mother's dying injunction that it should not be opened till a period arrived, which she named. I have guarded it,” she added, clasping her hands and raising her fine eyes, “as the Israelites guarded the ark of the living God. The time is now not far distant when I am at liberty to examine its contents—to explore my own history.” “But, my God!” interrupted Mr. Redwood, “Miss Bruce—Ellen—my poor child—have you quietly complied with so strange, so arbitrary a request?” “I never heard any thing so unaccountable, so ridiculous,” exclaimed Caroline. “Nor I,” said Mrs. Westall; “it is indeed inexplicable.” Westall said nothing: his eyes were rivetted with intense eagerness on Ellen, who replied, “can it be inexplicable to you, Mrs. Westall, who have a devoted son, to you, Miss Redwood, who can render a daily service to your parent, that I should hold sacred and dear the only act of filial duty that remains to me?” “You are too scrupulous, Miss Bruce,” said Mr. Redwood. “It cannot be your duty to comply with so unreasonable, so irrational a restriction: you may have a parent living, to whom your filial piety might be of some avail while you are rendering this fanciful homage to her who is insensible and unknowing as the clods of the valley.” “I do not believe it, Sir!” replied Ellen with impetuosity. “My mother seems always near to me; I hear her voice, I feel her influence in every event of my life; why she imposed this restriction on me, I know not, but that it had a sufficient cause I may trust to the tenderness of a dying mother's heart.” Charles Westall had listened with breathless interest; he now advanced involuntarily, and seizing Ellen's hand, “admirable being!” he exclaimed, “your enthusiasm cannot be taken from you— persevere—and,” he added, in a softened and tremulous voice, “God shield you from the shafts of the careless, the cruel, or the envious.” Ellen certainly felt a glow of gratitude and delight that there was one who perfectly understood her: such sympathies are well compared to the perfect accords of fine instruments. She had hardly uttered a fervent “thank you, Mr. Westall,” before a sudden feeling of the awkwardness of her conspicuous situation came over her;—her natural timidity had been controlled by stronger feelings, but now yielding to it, she abruptly left the room to seek the shelter of her own apartment. Westall's last words to Ellen were still ringing in Caroline's ears. “I trust, Sir,” said she, addressing herself to him, “that you did not mean to do me the C 3 honour to class me among the `careless, cruel, or envious?”' “Oh no, my sweet Caroline,” exclaimed Mrs. Westall, “how can you ask such a question: he did not indeed —you did not, my son—of course you could not?” Westall did not second his mother's earnest defence; he merely said coldly, “that he hoped Miss Redwood was not conscious of deserving to be so classed.” “Lord bless me!—no,” replied Caroline, “I had not thought of hurting the girl's feelings; who could have dreamed that she was listening at the door? But you know the old proverb, Mrs. Westall, `listeners never hear any good of themselves.”' “That is too often true, my love,” replied Mrs. Westall. “Mother!” exclaimed Charles Westall, in a tone that savoured of reproach, but had still more of grief than resentment in it; and then unable to endure any longer his mother's sycophancy, and perhaps unwilling to expose his own emotion, he left the room. “Shame on you, Caroline!” said her father. “Now really,” interposed Mrs. Westall, “I do not see that Caroline is at all in fault: how could she divine that Miss Bruce was within hearing?—indeed, my dear Sir, it was mere pleasantry on her part. It is a pity Miss Bruce, who appears so amiable, should tell such an incredible story; no one can believe it, you know, unless it be Charles. It is just like him to be taken with such romance; it was my dear husband's greatest fault; but I own, Caroline, I am shocked at Charles's inadvertence; I am sure it was unintentional.” “It is quite indifferent to me, whether it was or not,” replied Caroline, pouting, and evidently far enough from the stoical feeling she professed. Mrs. Westall perceived that this was not a propitious moment, and whispered to Caroline that Charles should do penance by going home at an hour so much earlier than usual, she took her leave, and returned to the village with her son. This was the first time that their return had not been animated by a conversation about Miss Redwood. This evening her name was not mentioned—neither spoke of the scene at the cottage, nor of Ellen's extraordinary disclosure. They mutually understood that their feelings did not harmonize, and both maintained silence. When they parted for the night, Charles kissed his mother, as was his custom, tenderly; and as he closed the door she heard him sigh deeply. She regretted that she had pained him, but she thought it a pity that he had such peculiar feelings.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XI. “I'll be so bold to break the seal for once.” Two Gentlemen of Verona. As soon as the Westalls were gone, Caroline rose to leave her father's room. “Stop for one moment, my child,” said he, “I hope that the experience of this day and evening has taught you, if not to be more generous in your judgments, to be more careful in the expression of them. I think you cannot fail to learn this lesson from the story of the blind child, which has furnished the solution to those mysterious morning walks, and that more mysterious night's absence which perplexed you so much, while you had nothing else to employ your thoughts upon.” “Yes, Sir, that riddle is read; but Miss Bruce has been so good as to give out another, which even you may be puzzled to solve.” “I shall not make the effort, Caroline. I entreat you to atone by your attentions to Miss Bruce for your unjust suspicions, and for your rudeness this evening; common justice requires that you should do so; and besides, I can assure you, it will not be an easy matter to efface the impression that your unfortunate remarks in relation to her have made on Westall's mind.” “I care not, Sir, whether they are effaced or not,” replied Caroline, sullenly. “Pursue your own way then, Miss Redwood. I shall not attempt to guide you.” “Thank you, Sir,” replied the daughter in a cool sarcastic tone which she could sometimes assume; and then wishing her father a good night, she retired to her own apartment in a state of mind resembling that of a petted child deprived of its play-things. She was surprised to find that Ellen, who had of late been constantly with Mrs. Allen, was already in her room. Ellen, believing that Caroline was still occupied with her guests, had taken her precious casket from one of her drawers, had placed it on the window-ledge, and was sitting in a deep reverie with her cheek leaning on it, when Caroline's entrance startled and somewhat disconcerted her. We ought not perhaps to draw aside the veil and disclose her secret meditations. It is better to appeal to the experience of other young ladies to determine whether it is not probable that the thoughts of Westall, and of the animated interest he had expressed for her, had not some part in her reverie, and whether the pleasure he had awakened did not more than counterbalance the pain Caroline had inflicted. There was a newlyfallen tear on the box which would not perhaps justify such a conclusion, but then her face was so bright and peaceful, that a malignant spirit might have shrunk in despair from the attempt to cast a shadow over it. She rose at Caroline's entrance to replace the box in the drawer. “Ah,” said Caroline, “that is your precious casket—is it, Miss Bruce? pray allow me to look at it.” She took it from Ellen's hand, and carelessly shaking it, said, “it is quite light, there is something rattles though—should it be a miniature? Lord! I would open it, perhaps the painting will be spoiled—I should like of all things to know whether it is a hoax—now do not look so like a tragedy-queen—all I mean is that it may have been a way your mother adopted to save your feelings—after all, perhaps it is nothing, it is not larger than one of my jewel cases.” “It contains all my jewels, Miss Redwood; permit me to take it,” replied Ellen, with some emotion; for she could no longer endure to see that handled and discussed with so much levity, which she had never touched but with a sentiment resembling religious awe. While Ellen replaced the box in the drawer, Caroline watched her, saying at the same time, (for she was displeased at Ellen's manner of resuming it) “I cannot have the slightest curiosity about the contents of your box, of course, Miss Bruce; but if they were as important to me as they are to you, I should not hesitate: it is quite silly to suppose there would be any harm in just taking a peep.” “My mind is entirely at rest on the subject,” replied Ellen. “There are feelings, Miss Redwood, that can control curiosity—even the most natural and reasonable curiosity. I am sorry that my poor concerns have been obtruded on your notice, but since they have been, the greatest favour you can do me now is to forget them;” then bidding Caroline good night, she returned to Mrs. Allen. `Forget them,' Caroline could not; the demon of curiosity had taken possession of her mind. She had suffered injurious thoughts of Ellen, till she had come to consider her as an enemy, of whom it was right to take any advantage. Her self-importance had been mortified by the deference paid to Ellen by the Lenoxes; her self-love offended by her father's excessive admiration. Caroline had the passions of a strong character, and the habits of a weak one. In her idleness her thoughts had brooded over Ellen's conduct, till she had magnified the most trivial circumstances into a ground of alarm or anxiety; but since the arrival of Charles Westall she had almost forgotten her, and quite forgotten her silly fancy of the danger of what she called a `sentimental affair' between Ellen and her father. The events of the day and evening had thrown a strong light on her rival, and cast her quite into the shade: this was enough to relume the fires of envy in Caroline's bosom, if they were not already kindled by the interest Westall had manifested in Ellen. A most convenient opportunity now offered to gratify her curiosity, perhaps to confirm her malicious conjectures. It was possible that the key to one of her trinket cases might open Ellen's box; there could be no harm in trying just to see if one would suit. She drew out the drawer in which she had seen Ellen replace her casket, and then paused for a moment—but, `c'est le premier pas qui coûte;” the first wrong step taken, or resolved on, the next is easy and almost certain. She carried the box to the light, found a key that exactly fitted, and then the gratification could not be resisted. She opened the box—a miniature laid on the top of it. Caroline started at the first glance as if she had seen a spectre— she took it out and examined it—a name legibly written on the reverse of the picture confirmed her first impressions. She replaced it in the box—she would have given worlds that she had never seen it—but the bold, bad deed, was done; and, `past who can recall, or done undo?' After pacing the room for a few moments in agitation of mind bordering on distraction, she returned to the examination of the box: there was in it a letter directed `To my child.'—It was unsealed, unless a tress of beautiful hair which was bound around it might be called a seal. There was also a certificate of the marriage of Ellen's mother to the original of the picture. Caroline's first impulse was to destroy the records: she went to the window, threw up the sash, and prepared to give Ellen's treasure to the disposition of the winds—but as she unbound the lock of hair that she might reduce the letter to fragments, it curled around her hand, and awakened a feeling of awe and superstition. She paused; she was familiar with folly, but not with crime; she had not virtue enough to restore Ellen's right, nor hardihood enough to annihilate the proof of it: a feeble purpose of future restitution dawned in her mind—the articles might be safely retained in her own keeping— future circumstances should decide their destiny—her grandmother ought to see them. This last consideration fixed her wavering mind, and she proceeded to make her arrangements with the caution that conscious guilt already inspired. She let fall the window-curtains, secured herself from interruption by placing the scissors over the latch of the door, and then refolded the letter, and carefully removed the miniature from its setting, tore the name from the back of it, and placed it with the hair, the letter, and the certificate, in a box of her own, which she securely deposited at the bottom of one of her trunks. In order to avoid a suspicion that might arise in Ellen's mind, should she miss the sound of the miniature, Caroline prudently restored the setting to the box, and then locked and replaced it in the drawer. For a moment she felt a glow of triumph, that the result of her investigation had made her the mistress of Ellen's destiny; but this was quickly succeeded by a deep feeling of mortification, a consciousness of injustice and degradation, and a fearful apprehension of the future;—even at this moment, who would not rather have been the innocent Ellen, spoiled of the object of years, of patient waiting and intense expectation, than the selfish, ruthless Caroline!—who would not rather have been the injured than the injurer! Caroline endeavoured to compose herself before she summoned her servant, for she already shrunk from the eye of an obsequious menial—so surely do fear and shame follow guilt. When Lilly came, in obedience to her call, and entering, exclaimed, “the Lord pity us! Miss Cary, you are as pale as a ghost, and all in a tremble,—do let me speak to Mistress Lenox.” Caroline replied, “no, no, Lilly, I am only shivering with the horrid air from the lake: mind your own affairs and undress me, and do not leave my bed-side till you see I am quite fast asleep. These terrible cold damp evenings at the north make one so wakeful and restless!” The succeeding morning Charles Westall came as usual with his mother to Mr. Lenox's. On their way Mrs. Westall, assiduous to gratify her favourite, had lingered to gather some wild honeysuckles for her, saying at the same time to her son, “that those beautiful and fragrant flowers were emblematical of Caroline.” Charles made no reply; but he thought that though the beauty of the flowers might be emblematical of Caroline, their fragrance was a truer emblem of that virtue which sends sweet incense to heaven, and is to beauty what the perfume is to the flower. As he proceeded forward, at a sudden turn of the road he caught a glimpse of Miss Redwood just issuing from Mr. Lenox's court-yard. He felt an invincible disinclination to meet her alone, and seeing that he was not perceived by her, he placed his hand on the garden-fence and sprang over it, and turning around some shrubbery, he was no longer within the range of Miss Redwood's observation. The spell of her beauty was broken; the power of the enchantress over him for ever lost by the revelation which she had made of her character in the conversation of the preceding day. “Thank Heaven!” exclaimed Westall, audibly, “I have awoke before it is too late.” “And what is that you thank Heaven for, young man?” inquired Debby, who was sitting under the shade of an apple tree shelling some beans. “Why, Miss Deborah,” replied Westall, smiling at his own abstraction, “is there not always enough of good received or danger escaped to be thankful for?” “A plenty, young man—a plenty, especially with you young folks, who have not the clearest light to walk by, and are too full of conceit to see by the candle of older people's experience. Pride and conceit are your ruin: I don't mean yours in particular, Mr. Westall,” Deborah continued, casting a side and approving glance at his fine modest and benignant countenance, “but the rising generation in general—it is pride and conceit that keep up such a will-worship, as the great Bunyan would call it. There is that Carliny girl, all nature could not convince her that all God's creatures wer'n't made for her sarvice and convenience.—The girl is no fool neither, nat'rally she is rather bright; the fault is in her bringing up; that I own is a VOL. II. D master-puzzle to me how such a reasonable smart man as squire Redwood—a very pretty behaved man too, especially when you consider that he has lived in a slave country—how he could have good materials worked up into such a poor manufacture. It is quite a pleasure,” continued Deborah, stimulated to proceed as others might have been by so patient a listener, “It is quite a pleasure to meet such a man as the Squire, who has travelled in the old countries, and taken note of what he has seen; for he a'n't like those travellers I have heard a man liken to Jonah in the whale's belly, who go a great ways and see nothing. But, after all,” she continued, giving the tin pan into which she was shelling her beans, an energetic shake, “after all, I don't know what good such stores of knowledge do people, if they don't make them of some sarvice in their conduct and happiness. To my mind, Mr. Westall, it is as if men were to gather all the nourishing rains into great cisterns, and there keep them, instead of letting them fall upon the earth, to bring forth good entertainment for man and horse, as the tavern signs say. Now there is my sister Lenox: she has not what are called shining talents; but, Mr. Westall, she has used all she has, in the true scriptur way. Just cast your eye about this garden;—I don't mean to praise myself, though I take all the care of it, 'bating the help I get from the boys, but poor tools at such work—look round at the long saace, the short saace, and the green saace[1] [1] Sauce, pronounced saace or sarce, is in most parts of New-England the vulgar name for culinary vegetables:—e. g. long saace—for beets, carrots, &amp;c.; short saace—for potatoes and turnips. ; they are all of my planting; and as you may observe, there is not a spot in the garden as big as your hat crown that has not some good and useful thing tucked into it, except it may be the pinies and pinks and roses—and them are D 2 good for sore eyes and other kinds of ailments, besides being pretty notions for the children;—well, this garden is a parfect picture of Miss Lenox's management of her family. Eleven children has she brought up, that is, the most of them are brought up, and the rest in a thriving way—and an honour and a credit will they be to her, and a blessing to the world, when she has played her part out above ground; and that time must come to her, as to all,” continued Debby, passing the back of her hand across her eyes, “and it is a time she need not shrink from,—for such a life is what you may call a continual making-ready for it. In my view, though it has never fallen to my lot to be married and have children—but that is neither here nor there—in my view there can't be so praiseful a monument to the memory of a parent as a real good child. I never mind this rhodomontade upon tomb-stones any more than so much novel writing; some of it may be true—the poor creatures that's mouldering away below, has lived and died, so much we know is sartin; but for the most part it's like one of the stories of that Gulliver revived, that's so divarting to the boys. Yes, a real virtuous child is a crown of glory to the parent; and as I said before, all the tomb-stones in the world, even them peramids and obelisks, and things cut out of brass, and made of a kind of marble mason-work that squire Redwood tells about in the old countries, they a'n't to be mentioned with it.” “It surprises me,” said Westall, who was evidently greatly interested by the honest and affectionate zeal with which Deborah lauded her sister—“It surprises me, Miss Deborah, that with such very correct views of the happiness and duties of parents, you should have chosen a single life.” Deborah's smile showed she was not insensible to the compliment implied in the word chosen; for like other maidens, she preferred it should be understood that she did not walk in the solitary path of celibacy by compulsion. “Oh, it was a whim of my own,” she replied, “and there is no danger of such whims being catching—sooner or later every body slides off into the beaten road of matrimony.” “But it is a pity, Miss Deborah, that you should have been governed by such a whim.” “Why I don't know, Mr. Westall—I don't know. In the first place, there is no danger in the example, for there's nobody that will follow it of their own good-will. I don't wish to speak my own epitaph, 'logium, or whatever you call it, but to my mind, a lone woman that no one notices, no one praises, that is not coaxed into goodness, that envies no one, minds her own affairs, is contented and happy—such a woman is a sight to behold!” “And to admire—certainly. I agree with you entirely, Miss Debby,” replied Westall. Deborah turned her eye upon Westall, pleased with his cordial concurrence in her own opinion, but his had been attracted by a groupe that seemed to have just taken their stations at the entrance door, which we have before had occasion to notice on the north side of Mr. Lenox's house. “Oh, I see how it is, young man,” she said, good naturedly, “old women have no chance at ears or eyes when young ones come in sight, especially those so comely as she is.” “I do not see Miss Redwood,” replied Westall, his eyes still rivetted to the spot. “Bless your dear heart, no, but you see one that is worth as many of her as can stand 'twixt here and Carliny.” “But it was beauty you spoke of, Miss Debby; and with all your partiality, I presume you do not pretend that Miss Bruce has as much beauty as Miss Redwood?” “Do not—but indeed I do though, and I could prove it too, to the satisfaction of any reasonable person.” “Ah,” replied Westall, “that is a matter of taste, that has not much to do with proof or reason; but let me see, Miss Debby, how you make out your case. I will be the champion of Miss Redwood's beauty, and sure no knight ever had a fairer cause for his chivalry. What do you say to that incomparable hair, black and glossy as a raven's plumage, turning into rich curls whenever it escapes from the classic braids that confine it?” “Oh, you talk too high grammar for me, Mr. Westall. Well, I never before heard there was any beauty in black hair; why mine was as black as hers before it turned gray, and I never heard a word said about the beauty of it. Now tell me, Mr. Westall, on your conscience, if you can think that black hair plaited, and twisted, and fussified, to be compared with Ellen's beautiful brown hair? why, man, I don't believe you ever saw it when she was combing it.” “No, I certainly never had that privilege.” “Well,” proceeded Debby, in her earnestness, not heeding the smile that hovered on Westall's lip, “I can tell you it reaches almost to the tops of her shoes; and then, when she doubles it into them rich folds, and fastens it with her comb, and parts it from the front in a kind of a wave—did you ever see any thing that had a cleaner, prettier look? and so bright and polished as if the sun was shining into it.” “I yield the point of the hair, Miss Debby; but what do you say to Miss Redwood's high marble brow?” “Proud, proud, Sir, and as cold as marble. Now Ellen's is just what a woman's should be, modest and meek. D 3 I am not gifted at description; but if you ever saw that picture of the Virgin Mary that our George sent home to his mother, (and between you and I, I always thought it was because it was such a likeness of Ellen that he sent it) you will know what I mean: look at the forehead, the temple, the mouth, the eyes—yes, most especially the eyes, and you will say, `this is an immortal creatur'—you need not smile, Mr. Westall: what I mean is, that that face has been lit up by a spark from heaven, as the hymn-book says, `a vital spark of heavenly flame,' and a spark that will never die. Now I should like to know if you get any such idea from Miss Redwood's flesh and blood?” “Oh, Miss Debby, I confess myself vanquished: I give up the face, but you will certainly have the candour to allow that Miss Redwood has the finest figure; so tall and graceful—she moves like Juno.” “That I won't deny. She is just like one of them heathen idols: every motion, sitting or rising, walking or standing, seems to say, look at me! worship me!— but Ellen!—she is behind a cloud just now; but if you had seen her as I have seen her, every step as light and springy as a fawn's, and now, if you take notice, her motions are all free like a child's, she never seems to think any one is looking at her. I never read any to speak of, in poetry, and novel books, and such things, so I can't compare Miss Redwood to any of the gentry you find there, but she always brings to my mind the daughters of Zion spoken of by the Prophet Isaiah, in his third chapter, 16th verse and on; while Ellen is like those Christian women the apostle commends, whose adorning is not outwardly, but that of a meek and quiet spirit: there is just the difference between the two girls that there is between the pomp and show and to-do of the old Jewish worship, and of that of our times, which is, (that is, ought to be) in spirit and in truth.” “Oh, you are blind, Miss Debby,” replied Westall, laughing, “there is no use in contesting the point with you, but I will go and see if I can discover any of these surprising charms;” so saying, he walked towards the house, while Deborah following him with her eyes, could not help wondering that a young man who seemed to her not to want sense or discernment should not, after all, know darkness from light. There had been showers during the night which had changed the air from extreme sultriness to a delicious purity and coolness. Even old Mrs. Allen's frame seemed newly braced by the sweet freshening breezes that came over the lake. Ellen had persuaded her to have her easy chair drawn to the door, in the hope that she would be cheered by the bright scene before her. After adjusting her pillows, placing a footstool at her feet, and putting her snuff-box and handkerchief into her lap, “Oh,” said she, “Mrs. Allen, is it not a glorious morning? Look at the mountains beyond the lake, how bright and distinct they look.” “My eyes are dim, child—I cannot see them.” “Now,” said Ellen, placing the old lady's spectacles over her eyes, “now you can see: oh, only look where the mist still rests between the mountains, and looks like a flood of melted silver; and there where it is rising up the side of the mountain—so bright, one might fancy it enrobed spirits of the air—and above, what a silvery curtain it hangs over that highest point—and there it has risen, and is melting away on the pure blue of the sky: the lake too is alive with the spirit of the morning, and the merry waves as they come dancing on before the breeze, seem to laugh as they break on the shore.” Ellen was an enthusiast in her susceptibility to the influence of natural beauty; the bright scene before her had kindled a rapturous sensation which might excuse one moment of forgetfulness that her old friend's senses were dull and cold; that the chords were broken, over which the glad voice of nature might breathe, discoursing sweet music. “Here, Ellen,” said she, languidly, “put away these spectacles—the days have come that I have no pleasure in them: there is a heavy weight on my heart, child, and it will not bound at such sights.” “But, dear Mrs. Allen, throw aside the weight for a little while,” said Ellen, while she playfully held the spectacles over the old lady's eyes, “you must enjoy this morning—all nature rejoices —the birds fill the sweet air with their music; and see those insects, what myriads of them are whirling in a giddy circle.” “And look, aunt Allen,” said little Lucy Lenox, who had just joined them, “look at the hay-makers, how busy and happy they are!” “But, Eddy is not among them,” replied the old lady, giving way to a childish burst of tears. “Where shall I look for my children, Ellen?” “Oh, Mrs. Allen, all this beauty is but a shadow of that brighter sphere to which Edward is gone.” “But, my little Emily, that lost one!” “The lost one may be yet found, dear Mrs. Allen, it is not right for you to despair.” “Your ministry is a kind one, my young friend,” said Mr. Redwood, advancing from his room where he had been listening to Ellen; “but vain I am afraid. The sick cannot swallow the food of the healthy; Mrs. Allen and I have travelled so far on this wearisome journey of life that we have exhausted the resources of youth.” “Mrs. Allen either did not hear or heed Mr. Redwood. “Lucy,” she said, “get your Testament and read me a few chapters; that is all the comfort left to me.” “There are then,” said Ellen, looking timidly at Mr. Redwood, “some resources that cannot be exhausted.” “Happy are those who think so,” replied Mr. Redwood, with an equivocal smile, which indicated that his respect for Ellen alone prevented him from saying, `that such a nostrum might do for an old woman, but had no efficacy for more enlightened subjects.' Lucy brought her Testament, and seating herself on Mrs. Allen's footstool, began her reading. “Lucy,” said Ellen to Mr. Redwood, “is quite a rustic, like the rest of us— unlearned in the forms of courtesy.” “I should be sorry, Miss Bruce, that you should deem me such a bigot to the usages of the world, as to require that an essential kindness should be deferred to the forms of politeness. No, so far from it, that if Miss Lucy will permit me, I will be one of her auditors.” So saying, he seated himself, and Ellen, having brought her portfolio from an adjoining room, placed herself on a bench under the elm tree which grew a few yards from the door-step. She was just finishing a sketch of the view from Mr. Lenox's house, which she had promised to George Lenox. Lucy proceeded with her reading, and Mr. Redwood listened with apparent interest, which might be accounted for by the novelty of the book to him; for, `en philosophe,' he had judged and condemned without examining the only record that pretends to any credible authority to teach us our duties and our destiny. The lecture would have been long, and might have been profitable, but it was interrupted by the approach of Mrs. Westall and Miss Redwood; they had been joined by Mr. Lenox, and Charles Westall, who was just issuing from the garden gate as the ladies entered the yard. “I did not know that this was an accomplishment of yours, Miss Bruce,” said Westall, advancing to her, and casting his eye over her drawing, which was too faithful a copy of the scene before them to be mistaken. “My knowledge of the art does not merit so dignified a name, Mr. Westall; slight as it is, however, it is a great gratification when it gives me the opportunity of gratifying an absent friend.” “And do you limit your benevolence to the absent, or will you permit me to examine the contents of your port-folio?” “Certainly,” said Ellen, “although it will hardly reward you for the trouble.” Ellen was unostentatious, and at the same time free from that false modesty which has its source in pride. She would have shrunk from any thing approaching to an exhibition of any of her talents, but she did not either from vanity or false humility imagine that there was in the efforts of her skill in drawing anything either to do her honour or discredit. Westall seemed in a most provokingly admiring humour. Not a graceful line, a happy light, or fortunate shadow escaped his observation. He called his mother and Miss Redwood, to point out to them a thousand beauties. Caroline's colour, brilliant from exercise, was certainly heightened as she approached Ellen. She looked over the drawings languidly, and said, “they were pretty sketches for any one who fancied landscapes.” Her mind was evidently intent on something beside the drawings, for her eye wandered from her father to Ellen for a few moments, when she seated herself with an expression of sullenness and abstraction that recalled the transactions of the preceding evening to all that had witnessed them: an awkwardness came over the whole party. Ellen busied herself with arranging and replacing her drawings; the operation did not seem to be accelerated by Westall's efforts to aid her. Mr. Redwood gazed on the two girls with feelings sufficiently mortifying to his paternal pride; he had abused the noblest feelings of his nature, but not extinguished them; his aspirations went beyond the mean gratification of his vanity, which might have been derived from the rare beauty of his daughter. The classic elegance of her figure, the brilliancy of her complexion (the more striking for its singularity in our southern country) the symmetry of her features, and that perfect control of her graceful movements which pride and fashionable success had given to her, invested her with a right to the infallible decision of the beau-monde, which had already pronounced her an unrivalled beauty. `Ah,' thought her father, as he explored her face in vain for some expression that might consecrate so fair a temple, and sighed at the pride, discontent, and scorn which he met there, `ah, my child, you look like a fit idol for a pagan worship; men would deify you, but you are all earthly. This Ellen Bruce,' thought he, as he turned his eye towards her, `has such a look of spirituality, so bright, and so tranquil too, that if there is a heaven she is surely destined to it.' Ellen had in truth a face of the beatitudes. `My child,' thought Mr. Redwood, as he pursued his melancholy reflections, `has no right to such an expression. Ellen's is “full of notable morality which it doth delightfully teach,” and might almost inspire.' Mr. Redwood was roused from his reverie by Lenox, who observing that his guest looked unusually grave, said, “why how now, Squire Redwood, can't all these women folks keep you in heart—or maybe you are heart-whole, but it is the arm pains you?” “No,” replied Mr. Redwood, “the arm is doing well enough, and will I hope soon be at the service of any of the ladies; but it is not their province, Sir, to keep the heart whole.” “I don't know as to that,” replied Lenox: “it is true wife gave mine something of a jerk when I was young; but I am one of the contented sort, Sir, and contentment, as likely you may have observed, is an article that is not to be bought.” “I believe not, friend Lenox, for if all men were of my mind, they would be all buyers and no sellers.” “Well, that is honest, Squire, I like that. If it was to be bought, I'm thinking you could make the purchase, if any body, for I judge you to be something of a nabob. What may be your yearly income, Squire?” Mr. Redwood was not prepared for so direct an investigation of his pecuniary affairs, he replied, “indeed, Sir, I do not know.” “Don't know!” exclaimed Lenox, quite unsuspicious of the impropriety of his inquiry—“that's surprising—I took the Squire for one of those smart knowing people that understands all about their own affairs. It must take,” he continued, surveying Caroline, “a pretty considerable handsome sum to furnish your daughter with all the fine clothes I see her wear. I dare say that her gewgaws (no offence, Miss Caroline, I only mean the flourishes) and your coach, and such kind of nick-nacks, cost you as much as it does a plain man like me to support my whole family, and bring them up in what may be called an honourable manner.” “It is very possible,” replied Mr. Redwood. “Well,” pursued the indefatigable man, “this is a free country, and every man has a right to do what he will with his own; if you are a mind to dress Miss Caroline in diamonds and gold beads, it is none of my affair. You never had any other child, I believe, Sir?” “No, Sir.” “That is a pity—such a fortune as you have to give makes a girl a sort of a prey to all the hungry hunters after money; but may be you calculate to divide some of your property with your other relations?” “I have made no calculations on the subject, Sir.” “I wonder you have never married again, Mr. Redwood; I conclude you was never married but once?” “You have a right to your own conclusions, Sir,” replied Mr. Redwood, so sternly, that Ellen involuntarily looked towards him. His eye met hers, and he was mortified that he should have betrayed his vexation, and he became still more disconcerted when Ellen said playfully, “oh Mr. Lenox, do not expect Mr. Redwood to tell all the secrets of his life before `the women folks.”' “Secrets of my life!” echoed Mr. Redwood, but in a smothered voice, while Caroline, who had been listening intently to the close of the conversation, sprang on her feet, and grasping Ellen's arm, exclaimed, looking on her as if she would have pierced her soul with the inquiry, “Ellen Bruce! what do you mean?” The movement had been involuntary. Caroline, unused to control her slightest emotions, could not resist the mastery of a strong passion. Ellen turned on her a look of such surprise and innocence, that she sunk back alarmed at her own precipitancy. Every eye was now fixed on her, as if to demand an explanation; while Mr. Redwood, whose mottled cheek and contracted brow betrayed strong emotion, was the first to recover his selfpossession; and when Caroline, hiding her face with her handkerchief, said, “excuse me, Miss Bruce, I am not well this morning,” her father said, sternly, VOL. II. E “your extraordinary conduct needs that apology, Caroline—oblige me with a few minutes in my room.” The request had too much the tone of a command to be disregarded; and Caroline (glad too to escape observation) followed her father. Mr. Redwood before entering his room turned to Mr. Lenox, and with the air of courtesy that always distinguished him, said, “my good friend Lenox, you must forgive my rudeness. We southern people are a little shy, and do not understand this game of question and answer as well as you frank northerners.” “Oh, no offence, Sir, none in the world,” said the good-natured Lenox, “it is a free country, Sir, that we live in, and every man has a right to his own notions, be they ever so notional; that is my doctrine.” “And a very liberal one, Sir,” replied Mr. Redwood, slightly bowing, and smiling as he closed the door after him. “Well, well,” said Lenox, “women are strange cattle. Why what ailed the girl, Ellen: is she hystericky? or may be,” he added, lowering his voice, and chuckling with the pride of a discoverer, “may be she is afraid you'll get away her sweetheart, Ellen, ha? have I guessed it?” It was now poor Ellen's turn to blush: she recollected suddenly that Mrs. Allen had been sitting in the air too long, and begged Mr. Lenox to assist her to her room, whither she followed, leaving Mrs. Westall and her son to their own musings. Charles Westall returned to the examination of the drawings which Ellen, in the haste of her attention to Mrs. Allen, had forgotten. Little Lucy stood by his side; “there,” said he, to the child, “do you know that Miss Bruce has put you into the picture, just as you sat reading to your aunt?” “Oh, has she! George will be glad to see me there?” E 2 “George! who is George?” inquired Charles Westall. “My brother; don't you know George?” “No, I do not. Is the picture for him, Lucy?” “Oh yes, Mr. Westall; and pray why should not it be for him?” asked the simple child, giving a very natural interpretation to the shade that flitted over Westall's face. “I am sure,” she continued, “George has sent a great many beautiful books to Ellen, and George loves her.” “Does he?” exclaimed Westall. “Yes, indeed, does he; don't you, Mr. Westall? I thought every body loved Ellen.” Lenox at this moment rejoined them, “like father, like child,” exclaimed he, with a hearty laugh,—“come along, Lucy; you and I ask plaguy unlucky questions this morning. Young man,” he added, turning to Charles, “I take a fancy to you—and if you do get any whims into your head, all the harm I wish you is, that you may have better luck than poor George.” We will not pretend to say whether it was the information insinuated in the kind-hearted Lenox's wish, or the expression of his favour, but one, or the other, or both, certainly kindled a bright expression of pleasure in Westall's face: his mother noticed it, and after Mr. Lenox had walked away she said to her son, “I am surprised, Charles, that you do not repress that man's familiarity; he is really becoming intolerable.” “Oh, not at all so to me, my dear mother.” “But, Charles, did you ever hear any thing so impertinent as his questions to Mr. Redwood?” “They scarcely deserve to be so stigmatised. Mr. Lenox lives in a simple state of society, where each man knows every particular of his neighbour's affairs, and he never suspected that his guest would not be as free to tell as he to ask. It is very easy to see all the imperfections of unpolished surfaces; but, perhaps, dear mother, as your eye seems somewhat dazzled by Miss Redwood's charms, you did not notice her strange start of passion.” “I noticed it, Charles, but I did not think it strange. Caroline has been out of spirits all the morning—quite dejected. You wounded her feelings last night, my son, too severely; it was that which made her so sensitive this morning. She was vexed, as she ought to have been, with the idle questions of this man Lenox; and perhaps she thought (for I thought so myself) that there was something too familiar in Miss Bruce's manner and observation.” “I confess, mother, that a young lady who gives such energetic demonstrations of her vexation at an offence so trifling, is rather formidable; and I think with you that it would be prudent to avoid her resentment.” “But, Charles, I am in earnest—you are trifling with your own interest; and I am sorry to say, my son, that you seem to have forgotten the deep obligations we are under to Mr. Redwood—his friendship for your father—for you. Caroline's only offence seems to be a predilection (perhaps too obvious) for you, and the kindest, most generous affection for me.” Mrs. Westall paused —she thought Charles's silence indicated conviction, and she ventured to proceed a step farther: “as to this Miss Bruce, her story is quite an incredible one. Do not look at me thus, my son. I do not mean that it is an intentional imposture of hers—I dare say she is— that is, she may be, quite innocent about it; but as Caroline says, and Caroline has uncommon penetration—in that she resembles her father—Caroline says that it must be an invention of Ellen's mother to screen the disgrace of her birth; of course you know a woman of the sort that her mother must have been would not scruple a contrivance of that kind, which might induce some credulous fellow, as Caroline says, to marry her daughter. No considerate man certainly would think of marrying a woman whose history is so involved in mystery—as Caroline says, no man in his senses should forget the old proverb, `like mother, like daughter.”' “For heaven's sake, my dear mother,” exclaimed Westall, unable any longer to maintain his dutiful patience, “speak from your own heart, and do not retail to me any more of Miss Redwood's sayings; forgive me—I cannot endure to see her play on your kind dispositions. I appeal, my dear mother, to your own heart. Is there not something touching —sacred—in Ellen Bruce's faith in her mother's truth—in her scrupulous and patient fidelity? I declare to you, if Miss Redwood is right in her worst conjectures, I think the parent's fault is redeemed by the daughter's virtue.” Mrs. Westall knew that her son was unmanageable in any matter in which his feelings were earnestly engaged, though habitually yielding in trifles; she saw the impossibility of stemming the present current that had set against her. Although dazzled by the brilliant prospects that she had imagined were opening to her son, she was not quite insensible to the virtuous feelings that governed him, and when she concluded the conversation by saying, “Charles, you are a singular being,” there was a mixture of satisfaction and disappointment in the confession. The purely accidental inquiries of honest Lenox had operated like the apple of discord on the group assembled at the good man's door. It is too well known to require remark that this busy spirit of investigation pervades the mass E 3 of society in New-England—“leaveneth the whole lump.” It appears, among the illiterate, in what the polite call “idle and impertinent questions,” and, among the educated, in a very free and sometimes inconvenient spirit of inquiry into what the prudent or austere would deem unquestionable. Whether this passion is blameable or praiseworthy we leave to those whom it may concern to determine; but certain we are that it is incurable; since it has been our chance to see an old lady perfectly blind and deaf, who, by taking the hand of a friend, and understanding from a strong or feeble pressure an affirmative or negative, contrived so ingeniously and indefatigably to vary and multiply her questions, as to ascertain all the details of all the affairs of all her acquaintance. There had been so many agreeable circumstances in Mr. Redwood's situation, that he had for the most part endured this inevitable evil with good nature; but sometimes his wincing would show that he was galled, and once or twice he thought that the case of the poor Dutchman, who is said to have been questioned to death by a relentless Yankee, would not have been a singular instance of the fatal effects of this curious mode of persecution.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XII. “But I have seen since past the Tweed, What much has changed my sceptic creed.” Marmion. Mr. Redwood, as has been said, retreated to his room; and Caroline, with the appearance at least of passive obedience, followed him. A few moments' reflection restored to her her self-confidence. She now for the first time in her life felt the operation of powerful motives, and the strength of her own passions. She was destitute of natural sensitiveness, and emboldened by the hardy resolution that had never experienced trial nor defeat. Determined to repair the faults of her sudden gust of passion by a wariness that should baffle her father's penetration, she folded her arms, and seated herself very composedly, as if awaiting her father's pleasure—while he walked the room in extreme, and as his varying colour indicated, uncontrolable agitation. He complained of his arm — it was excessively painful; “then, Sir,” said his daughter, with the most perfect nonchalance, “the attendance of the physician would be more appropriate than mine.” “No!” replied Mr. Redwood, in a thrilling tone; “no—there is no physician that can heal my wounds. Oh Caroline!” he continued, suddenly taking her hand, “you are my child, my only child”—he was choked by his emotion, and unable to proceed; he again turned from her, while she with a coolness which bordered on insult, replied, “yes, Sir, so I flattered myself; but you announce it as if it were a discovery.” Mr. Redwood sunk into a chair, his face betrayed the strong mental conflict he was suffering. The emotion his daughter had manifested at the question and remarks, to which, as he thought his conscience could alone give significance, had led him to suppose that she had in some way possessed herself of his early history, and he had suddenly resolved to obtain from her all she knew, and to disclose to her all of which she was ignorant. Her manner had checked— congealed the current of his feelings; his habitual reserve, which in this moment of excitement a kind tone, a single expression of gentleness, of affectionate sympathy, would have dissipated for ever, resumed its power over him. He sat silent and abstracted until Caroline said, “as you seem to have no farther occasion for me, Sir, I will go to my own apartment.” “No, stay, Caroline—you must first explain to me your singular conduct to Miss Bruce.” Miss Redwood said there was nothing to explain — she meant nothing — she thought it very extraordinary that she must give a reason for every movement —her manner might have been a little hurried—she was not very well—she was fatigued with her walk—teased to death with old Lenox's impertinence, and disgusted with Miss Bruce. “But why disgusted, Caroline? It seems to me nothing could be more proper than the gentle check Miss Bruce gave to Lenox; nothing more innocent and unmeaning than what she said.” “You certainly, Sir, are the most competent judge of her meaning—if you were not offended it was quite unnecessary that I should be provoked.” “Caroline? what would you say, what would you insinuate?” “Nothing in the world, Sir,” she answered, and added with a bitter smile, “nothing but what you may choose to understand. I am not accustomed,” she continued, undisturbedly enduring her father's piercing gaze, “I am not accustomed to have so much importance attached to my expressions. Miss Bruce may walk in mystery, and talk enigmas with impunity, while my poor simple phrases are received like the dark sayings of a sybil.” Mr. Redwood's suspicions were again averted by his daughter's skill and daring in parrying his question. After a few moments' consideration, he wondered they had been excited, and believed that she had accidentally touched the secret spring which he alone commanded. He said something of the excitability of his feelings in his present weak state, and did not permit Caroline to leave him without exhorting her to be more careful and conciliating in her manners for the little time they should remain at Eton. He again departed from the strict reserve he had imposed upon himself, and hinted how much he should be pained by Caroline's losing the esteem of Westall, and even how much he should be gratified by her securing and returning the young man's affections. She replied, “that to secure Mr. Westall's affections she had no reason to believe would be a difficult enterprise—as to her own, she was in no haste to dispose of them.” Her father commended her reserve, said he had no wish to control her choice of a husband, and perhaps no right to expect her confidence. “Our intercourse, Sir,” she said, rising to leave the room, “has not been particularly confidential.” “Strange girl!” exclaimed her father, as she closed the door after her; “what has so suddenly invested you with the power to torture me?” Mr. Redwood began now to talk of recommencing his journey, which Dr. Bristol assured him he might do after a few days without any hazard. As the time approached for his departure, he felt a growing reluctance to leave the rustic friends from whom he had received such genuine kindness, and whose simple and tranquil pleasures had in some degree restored a healthful tone to his mind. From day to day he delayed fixing the time of their departure, for which both Mrs. Westall and Caroline had become excessively impatient. The blessing, whatever it may be, of `those that wait,' seemed to have descended upon Charles Westall. He was, as he insisted it became him to be, since he was in attendance on his superior, a monument of patience. It is possible that his virtue was in part owing to his being indulged almost constantly with Miss Bruce's society. Mrs. Allen, as Deborah had suggested, had become quite childish; and of late she had taken a whim to sit constantly in the parlour, where the company was in the habit of assembling. She took no part in the conversation which she probably did not understand, but (as we have sometimes remarked of persons at her stage of existence) the variety of tones and objects appeared to afford her a kind of excitement and relief. Caroline was evidently annoyed by this new arrangement, but she had tact enough to conceal how hard it was for her to submit to it, and to deport herself with such decent decorum and medium civility, as in general to avert observation, and most effectually to conceal her secret sentiments. Mrs. Westall, who was really amiable when not perverted by a bad influence, was sometimes won by the sweetness of Ellen's manners to forget the superior attractions of Miss Redwood; and Ellen, happy in her own integrity, and unconscious of design, was frank, natural, and often spirited: so much so, that Westall thought that if she had not all the pensive and serious beauty which Deborah had attributed to her, she possessed a variety and animation that were more in harmony with the spring-time of life. For himself, with the inconsequence of a feeling and generous nature, he abandoned himself without a calculation for the future to present influences. If the ladies walked, and the mother flattered herself that by her skilful disposition she had secured Charles's attendance to Caroline, he was sure to revert to Ellen's side in some direct way, that distanced manoeuvring—if he read aloud, at every fine passage his eye appealed to Ellen — in every conversation they expressed almost simultaneously the same sentiment. On one occasion their sympathy was elicited in a way that excited some apprehension in the observers as to its dangerous tendency. Caroline had arranged a Turkish turban on Mrs. Westall's head, which she pronounced to be surprisingly becoming. “See, papa,” she said, “does not Mrs. Westall look twenty years younger for this turban?” “The turban does you infinite credit certainly, Caroline,” replied her father, “but I cannot pay it a compliment which would imply that any disposition of her dress could make Mrs. Westall look twenty years younger.” “Ah my dear Caroline,” interposed Mrs. Westall, “you know not how far you tax your father's sincerity; he knew me twenty years ago—and he perceives that (as Miss Debby insists, you know) `every year has made its mark.' Time makes sad havoc in twenty years,” she continued addressing herself to Mr. Redwood; “I think it is little more than that since my beautiful friend, Mary Erwine, was staying with me, and you were almost constantly at our house— bless me, Caroline, you have run that pin half way into my head.” Caroline `begged pardon—said she had put the last pin in the turban, and would go and meet Mr. Westall, who she saw coming up from the lake, and bespeak his suffrage for her taste.' The mention of Mary Erwine appeared to have revived the past in Mrs. Westall's memory. “Pray, Mr. Redwood,” she asked, “did you ever see Mary after she went to live with the Emlyns?” “Yes—repeatedly.” There was something startling in the tone of Mr. Redwood's voice, for Ellen, who was sitting beside Mrs. Allen at one extremity of the room, let fall a book which she was intently perusing, and looked involuntarily at him: and Mrs. Westall said with a smile, “you remind me of one of my dear Edmund's sentimental fancies—he thought you were in love with Mary.” Mr. Redwood made no reply, and she continued—“I knew you would not think of her of course; poor Mary—she was a sweet creature— such simplicity and tenderness—and such perfect beauty. She left Virginia I think soon after you embarked for Europe: indeed it was not long after that she died. I never could endure to think of her melancholy fate—so beautiful and so young—not seventeen when she died.” “Miss Bruce,” interrupted Mr. Redwood, “may I trouble you for a glass of water?” Ellen brought one from an adjoining room. “Upon my word,” said Mrs. Westall, “it never struck me before, but I really fancy Miss Bruce resembles Mary; did it ever occur to you?” “Yes, madam, I perceived it, I was struck with it the first time I saw Miss Bruce.” Mr. Redwood spoke quick and with a tremulous voice, he knew that he had betrayed emotion, and anxious to put a stop to the conversation, he turned suddenly to Ellen, and asked her what book she was reading. “The Absentee.” “The Absentee—a tale of Miss Edgeworth's, I believe; will you do me the favour to read aloud?” “Certainly; but I am near the conclusion of the book.” “That is of no consequence; the story is, in my view, always a subordinate part, and the sense and spirit of Miss Edgeworth's dialogue, open her books where you will, is sure to instruct and entertain you.” “Well, Sir, then I will begin where I am, just at the adjustment of an account with a Mr. Solo, `no vulgar tradesman.”' Ellen read aloud, but she had not read far when Caroline entered with Charles Westall; and she laid aside her book while the turban was discussed. Westall pronounced it to be beautiful, declared it could not have been in better taste if his mother had had the graces for her Coîffeurs.” “But, Miss Bruce,” he said, addressing Ellen, “I entreat that we may not interrupt your reading.” “No, Miss Ellen,” said Mr. Redwood, “they must not—I as an invalid have a right to be humoured—I beg you will proceed.” Ellen resumed the book, and read with feeling and expression the ever-memorable scene of Colambre's declaration to Grace Nugent, till she came to the passage where Colambre says, there is an `invincible obstacle' to their union. Her voice faltered; but she would have had enough self-command to proceed, had not Mr. Redwood inquired, “what obstacle could be invincible where a creature so artless, so frank, so charming, was in question?” “A sufficient obstacle, papa,” interposed Caroline; “Lord Colambre believed that Miss Nugent's mother was not `sans reproche.”' “That may be a sufficient obstruction VOL. II. F in a work of fiction,” replied Mr. Redwood, “but in real life, with a man of sense and feeling, a man deeply in love, too, I fancy it would not be a very serious objection. What say you, Charles, you are a young man of the class I have named?” Mr. Redwood looked to Westall for a reply; he perceived his question had disconcerted him—he looked at Ellen, her face was crimson—the application that had been made of the fictitious incident instantly flashed across his mind. “I perceive,” he added, with his usual adroitness, “that I have proposed a nice question in ethics. I am no casuist, and was not aware that it admitted a doubt.” “Nor does it,” said Westall, recovering himself completely. “I know not how it may be in the artificial ethics of the world, but it seems to me to be the decision of natural justice that the fault of one person cannot be transferred to another—that it cannot be right to make an innocent child suffer for the guilt of its parent.” Ellen took a long breath, and oppressed with the consciousness of feelings which she feared to expose, she experienced the greatest relief from an opportunity that was afforded her to escape from the apartment, without attracting observation to herself, by Deborah's appearance at the door with a letter in her hand, and a summons to Mrs. Lenox. Mrs. Westall and Caroline fell into a conversation which, though conducted in a whisper, appeared to be very interesting to themselves. Westall took up the book Ellen had laid down: his eyes seemed spell-bound to the page she had been reading, for Mr. Redwood (whose vigilance was now thoroughly awakened,) observed that he did not turn the leaf; and Mr. Redwood had himself an ample fund for meditation in the possibility that had now for the first time occurred to him that Ellen, the undesigning artless F 2 Ellen, might frustrate his long cherished project. In the evening, after Mrs. Westall and her son had returned to the village, and Miss Redwood had retired to her apartment, Mr. Redwood was still sitting in the parlour, reading some newspapers which had been received by the day's mail, when Ellen entered, and after apologising for interrupting him, said, “that she had just determined on leaving Eton in the morning, and she was not willing to go without expressing her gratitude to Mr. Redwood for the kind attentions he had bestowed on her.” Mr. Redwood, after expressing his surprise and regret, inquired the cause of this sudden arrangement, and Ellen stated to him that Mrs. Allen had just received a letter from Emily, in which, without expressly allowing that she was unhappy, she betrayed discontent—It professed to be written merely to inform her grandmother that `she was well, and that she hoped she was enjoying the same blessing;' she said `it was a big cross she had taken up; that all that called themselves shakers, were not shakers indeed; that wherever there were true disciples, there was also a Judas; that she had many thoughts of her grandmother, and sometimes it was so much in her heart to go home to her, that she believed that she had a call to leave “the people;” but that her elder sister, who was gifted to interpret, told her such thoughts were temptation.' The conclusion of the letter, Ellen said, was evidently drenched with the poor girl's tears. She had written one sentence repeatedly, and as often crossed it out; they had been able, after many vain attempts, to decipher it; it ran thus:— “I send my kind remembrance, as in duty bound, to James Lenox, for all his goodness to my natural brother, and to me in times past: tell James also, that if he knew what trouble some people have, he would not blame them, but he would pity them from his heart.” “This, Sir,” continued Ellen, “is to you an unmeaning jargon; but we, from our knowledge of poor Emily, infer from it that she is tired of her unnatural seclusion; that her early attachment to James has revived, in spite of her dutiful efforts to extinguish it; and we have fears that she is suffering persecution in some way which she dare not communicate. The letter must have been written and conveyed away secretly, as it was post-marked `Albany;' and the experienced ones would never have permitted such a document to issue from their retreat.”' “And why,” asked Mr. Redwood, “should this letter occasion your departure?” “It has been determined in a family conference,” replied Ellen, “that an effort shall be made to rescue Emily. James, who in truth has long loved her, is most earnest in her cause. He frankly avows his attachment, but is afraid of appearing in the enterprise, lest Emily should be persuaded by her spiritual guides that he is an emissary from the arch enemy. Deborah, who looks upon herself as a natural protector of the weak and oppressed, has volunteered a crusade to the shakers, provided I will accompany her. She has an extraordinary confidence in my influence with Emily— and with Susan too, the `elder sister.”' Mr. Redwood inquired `if it were possible that she would undertake such an enterprise with no protector but Deborah?' Ellen assured him `that nothing was more common or safe, than for females to travel from one extremity of New-England to the other, without any other safeguard than the virtue and civility of the inhabitants; that where there was no danger there was no need of protection, and that for her own part she should esteem her good friend Deborah's right arm as sufficient a defence for these modern times, as a gallant knight or baron bold would have been in the days of danger and of chivalry.' Mr. Redwood ventured to hint, that although Miss Debby might be a sturdy protector, she certainly was a ludicrous chaperone for a young lady. Ellen frankly confessed that she felt a little squeamishness on that account: “but, Sir,” said she, “I never could forgive myself, if I permitted a foolish scruple of that kind to prevent me from rendering an essential service to the Allens. I owe them a vast debt, and I have small means to pay it.” Mr. Redwood commended her motive, and half an hour after was perhaps glad that it controlled her, but at this moment his reluctance to part with her overcame his apprehension that she might possibly interfere with the accomplishment of his favourite project—he earnestly urged delay; but Ellen said there were domestic reasons for their going at once which she could not oppose. “Then, my dear Miss Bruce, if I must part with you, allow me to say that I feel an interest almost paternal in the issue of your hopes—not the generous hopes you are indulging for this little shaker girl, but those which relate to the development of your own history. Oh Ellen!” he continued with emotion, and fixing his melancholy eye steadfastly on her, “you little dream of the supernatural power your face possesses over my feelings—my memory: there are thoughts that quite unman me;” he clasped his hands and was silent, while Ellen awaited in amazement and trembling expectation what he should next say: but after a moment's pause, he resumed his composure and proceeded in his ordinary tone. “Your society, Ellen, has been a cordial to my weary spirit. I have worn out the world; but here in this still place, amid F 3 these quiet scenes, where the sweet spirit of contentment dwells, here,” he added, taking Ellen's hand, “where I have seen that it is possible to forego the display of talent and the gratification of taste, to practise the obscure virtues which are the peculiar boast of your religion—the virtues silent and secret, that neither ask nor expect earthly notice or reward— here I have felt a new influence—I have seemed to breathe a purer, a heavenly air—and I have sometimes hoped”— “What, Sir, what?” exclaimed Ellen, eagerly. “That you would make a convert of me, my sweet friend.” “Would to heaven!” said Ellen. “Nay,” replied Mr. Redwood, mournfully shaking his head, “I believe it is too late. It is a beautiful illusion; but I have outlived all illusions, Ellen: the man cannot return to the leading-strings of infancy—he cannot unlearn his philosophy—he cannot forget his experience.” “But he can examine if his philosophy be the true one—Oh, Mr. Redwood”— Ellen blushed and faltered, her heart was overflowing—but the natural timidity of a woman in the presence of a man, her elder and her superior, restrained her: she was frightened at her own daring— and while she hesitated, Mr. Redwood said, “spare yourself any farther trouble about me, Ellen—I am too rigid to bend to a new yoke. It would be as impossible for me to adopt your faith as for you to assume the manacles of your friend Susan Allen. But I am not cruel enough to wish to weaken your hopes— we will waive this subject—do you go without seeing the Westalls?” “Yes, Sir, we go early.” “I am sorry for it; they will regret it —they both esteem you, Miss Bruce. We must all support your departure as well as we can—when you are gone, much as I like the Lenoxes, I shall no longer find it impossible to tear myself away. The Westalls will I hope accompany us to New-York and Philadelphia, perhaps to Virginia. Westall shall never leave us if we can detain him. Ellen, you are worthy of all confidence, and I will venture to tell you, what indeed you may have already discerned, that I am extremely desirous to ally my daughter with Charles Westall. You look grave —you do not think Caroline worthy so happy a destiny?” Mr. Redwood perceived that Ellen was embarrassed, and he proceeded, “I will not tax your sincerity, Miss Bruce; my daughter has faults, great faults— still she has splendid attractions: her beauty might gratify the pride of any man—her fortune is immense—and if she has faults, why I know no one so likely to cure them as Charles Westall. I have not, I confess, as yet observed any indications of a particular interest in her; but she has insinuated in a conversation that we have had together, that she has it in her power to receive or reject him.” Ellen walked to the window and threw up the sash. “You look pale, Miss Bruce, are you not well?” continued Mr. Redwood. “Perfectly well,” she replied, “but the evening is oppressively warm.” “I was not aware of that,” said Mr. Redwood, shivering as the chill air blew on him from the window. “I believe it is not very warm,” replied Ellen, closing the window. “I am a little fatigued with the preparations for our journey,” she added, re-seating herself with her face averted from Mr. Redwood. “I will detain you but one moment longer, Miss Bruce; should you from your own observations conclude that Westall was interested in my daughter?” “I cannot say, Sir—I know nothing of the manners of the world.” “It is not necessary you should: women have an instinct on this subject that surpasses the sagacity of experience—tell me then frankly the result of your observations.” Ellen after making a vain effort to reply with composure, stammered out, that “Miss Redwood certainly must know, and Miss Redwood had said”—Here she hesitated again, and Mr. Redwood compassionating her embarrassment, said, “you are right, Ellen; you are too prudent to flatter my wishes.” Ellen, anxious to avail herself of this moment, rose, and giving Mr. Redwood her hand, bade him farewell; he reiterated his expression of interest and kindness, and they parted. “Poor girl!” thought Mr. Redwood, as she closed the door; “it is as I suspected: the most virtuous seem always the most persecuted by destiny. Why should another thorn be planted in her innocent bosom?” Mr. Redwood felt a consciousness that he might avert the destiny he deprecated —he had virtue for good emotions, but not for the difficult sacrifice of a favourite object. Believing as he had, that the best owe most of their virtue to the applause of society, or to the flattery of their little world; the unostentatious goodness of Ellen (dignified as he deemed her by talents and improvement) had made a deep and ineffaceable impression on him. He sate for a long time meditating on her character and singular history; he thought that if there were ever two beings formed to make a joyous path over this wilderness world, they were Ellen and Westall. He reproached himself with wishing to interpose his plans to frustrate such possible happiness. He thought he never came in contact with the good and lovely without inflicting suffering on them. It had been Mr. Redwood's destiny through life to feel right and to act wrong—to see and to feel, deeply feel, the beauty of virtue, but to resign himself to the convenience or expediency of wrong. His impulses were good—but what is impulse without principle? what is it to resist the eternal solicitations of selfishness, the sweeping tempests of passion? Mr. Redwood had an unconquerable wish to bestow some benefit on Ellen. He had none in his power but of a pecuniary nature, and that it was difficult to offer without offending her delicacy. He determined, however, to do it, and he enclosed bank notes to the amount of five hundred dollars in the following note: “My dear Miss Bruce must not punish my temerity in offering her the enclosed, by refusing to accept it. Being a parent, I understand the wants of a young lady—allow me then to act as the representative of your father. By permitting me now and in future to supply those vulgar wants, from which none of us are exempt, you will make me a convert to the common opinion, that a rich man is enviable.” After sealing the pacquet, he gave it to Deborah with a request that she would not deliver it until after she and her companion had left Eton. Ellen retired to her room to occupy herself with the preparations for her journey. Her wardrobe was simple, but neat, and not inelegant. It had been amply furnished, not only with necessaries, but with the little luxuries of a lady's equipage, by Mrs. Harrison, from the abundant stores of her youthful and prosperous days. The costume in which a lady of fortune had figured twenty years gone by, would have been quite too antique, but, happily, Ellen's taste and ingenuity enabled her gracefully to adapt it to her own person and the fashion of the day. The journey she was about to undertake was a long one, and, in obedience to the wise caution of Mrs. Lenox, she prepared for any delay that might occurr; a prudence enforced by Deborah, who said that as she had not journied for twenty years, she should not hurry home. After packing her trunk, she made a safe corner in it for her casket, little dreaming that the spirit was not there. She had never been separated from it since it was first transferred to her possession. She locked her trunk, arranged her dressing case, and took up her Bible to place in it—a beautiful little Bible with gold clasps, the gift too of Mrs. Harrison. Her recent conversation with Mr. Redwood made her feel its value, particularly at this moment. Her eye glistened while she kissed it with an emotion of gratitude at the thought of the solace it had been, and would be to her. Such emotions prove that religious sufferers have a compensation for their trials. A wish suddenly arose in Ellen's mind that she could impart the truths and consolations of that book to Mr. Redwood. The thought seemed like inspiration. If she was enthusiastic, who can blame an enthusiasm so benevolent? She wrapped the book with this short note in an envelope:—“My dear Mr. Redwood, accept and value this treasure for the sake of your friend Ellen Bruce, may I not say for your own sake—God bless you.” She left the pacquet with Mrs. Lenox to be delivered after her departure. As she was returning to her own room she heard Westall's voice in the parlour: he had come back with some message from his mother for Miss Redwood. Ellen obeyed the first impulse of her feeling, and moved towards the parlour door: she felt her heart beating violently, and surprised and alarmed at her own agitation, she retreated reluctantly to her apartment. `Perhaps,' she thought, `Mr. Redwood will tell him that I am going away, and he will ask to see me'— but soon after she heard him shut the parlour door—heard him go out of the house—and at the last sound of his retiring footsteps she burst into tears; shocked at the discovery of her own feelings, she hastily undressed, and threw herself on the bed in the hope that sleep would dispel the images that crowded her mind, but sleep she could not. In the multitude of her thoughts; her anxiety for Emily, her concern at leaving Mrs. Allen, her regret at parting with Mr. Redwood, there was still one that predominated over every other. Was it possible that Westall, pure, excellent, elevated as he was, could love Caroline Redwood? or worse—not loving, could he marry her? It must be so—if it were not, all womanly feeling would have forbidden the communication Caroline had made to her father. Ellen tried to persuade herself that she had no other interest in it than that benevolent one which it was natural and right to feel in Westall's happiness: but alas! the melancholy result of her `maiden meditation,' was that she was not `fancy free;' and, involuntarily, she covered her face with her hands as if she would have hidden from her own consciousness the tears and blushes which the discovery cost her. At this moment she was startled by a loud shriek from Caroline. She sprang to her bedside, and Caroline grasping her arm, stared wildly at her, as if the phantom that had scared her sleep had not yet vanished. “You were dreaming, Miss Redwood.” “Dreaming! was I dreaming?” said Caroline, still continuing her fixed gaze on Ellen, “bring the light nearer, Ellen. Yes, thank God! I was dreaming.” “What dream, Miss Redwood, could thus terrify you?” “Oh Ellen, I thought I saw you and Westall standing together on the summit of that rock on the lake-shore; and there was a soft silvery cloud floating just over you, it parted, and I saw a beautiful spiritual creature bending from it; her garments of light floated on the bright cloud; she had a chaplet of white flowers in her hand like those you plucked for me: while I was gazing to see if she would place it on your head; the earth trembled where I stood, a frightful chasm yawned before me, and my father was hurling me into it, when I awoke.” “It was a strange dream,” said Ellen, with a melancholy smile. “How strange, Miss Bruce? can you read dreams? have you faith in them?” “Not the least;” and it is well for me that I have not, for in this case, as dreams are interpreted by contraries, you would be on the rock and I in the chasm.” “That is true,” replied Caroline; “but it was, as you say, a strange dream; even now I see his eye bent on you.” “Whose eye?” inquired Ellen, who began to think Caroline had really lost her senses. “Westall's,” she replied, her brow again contracting. “Your dream then is already working by rule, for his eye will never be bent on me again.” “Never, what do you mean, Miss Bruce?” Ellen explained to Caroline that she was to leave Eton in the morning, and should not return for some weeks. “Thank God!” exclaimed Caroline, springing from the bed, entirely unable to control the relief she felt from Ellen's information. Ellen rose also: she said nothing, but her face expressed so plainly: “In what have I offended?” that after a moment's pause, Caroline proceeded to say, “It is in vain, Ellen Bruce, it is useless longer to conceal my feelings towards you, sleeping or waking they are always the same; from the first moment that we met, you have in every way injured me, crossed my purposes, baffled my hopes, and all under cover of such artlessness, such simplicity. Above all things I hate hypocrisy, and I will have the satisfaction of telling you before you go that I at least have seen through your disguises, and neither set you down for an innocent nor a saint.” Ellen was confounded with this sudden burst of passion. “I know not, Miss Redwood,” she said, calmly, “what you mean by your insinuations. I know not how I have interfered with you: but one thing I know, that your opinion, determined as you are to misunderstand and misrepresent me, ought not—cannot affect my happiness.” “Lord bless me, how heroic! but there is one whose opinion may possibly affect your happiness. Mrs. Westall sees through you as plainly as I do, and if she can help it, I assure you you will not succeed in wheedling her son out of his affections and senses with all your pretty romantic devices.” “My devices! oh, Miss Redwood, you are cruel—what are my devices?” “Really, Miss Ellen Bruce, you flatter yourself they have all passed current with us simple ones—the trumpery story about the box—a fine Arabian night's entertainment, truly; your dragging that old woman day after day into the parlour to practise your benevolence upon, as the milliners display their fashions on their blocks; the pretty tale of the blind girl, admirably got up to be sure, with a hundred other inferior instances of your mode of practice upon the romantic unsuspecting Westall.” Ellen could have borne unmoved Caroline's malice, but the thought of the odious light in which she should be presented to Westall quite overcame her VOL. II. G fortitude. “I could not have believed Mrs. Westall so ungenerous—so unjust,” said she, bursting into tears. `Ah,' thought Caroline, `I have touched the vulnerable spot;' and she would have proceeded with savage barbarity in the application of her tortures, but she was interrupted. Mrs. Lenox tapped at the door to say that Deborah was in readiness, and to beg Ellen to despatch her preparations. Mrs. Lenox's voice operated as a sedative upon Caroline: she sat down and fixed her eyes on Ellen, while she with trembling hands proceeded to array herself for her departure. When every thing was in readiness, she approached Caroline, and said with a faltering voice, “Miss Redwood, I forgive you; may God forgive your unkind, unnatural treatment of one who never injured you in thought, word, or deed. I would ask you to spare me when I am gone, but I have no reason to hope for that. To God,” she continued, with a solemnity that appalled Caroline, “to God, my father and my friend, I commit my cause —I have no earthly protector, and I need none. We part for ever; this for ever compasses the limit of our earthly career, and brings us to that presence where we must next meet, where all injustice will be exposed—all wrong repaired.” Caroline had covered her eyes as if to shut out the vision of innocence and loveliness. Ellen's words touched her with a feeling of remorse, and awakened appalling fears: her passions were turbulent, but not yet hardened into the resolution of one inured to the practice of evil. As Ellen turned from her she started from the bed and exclaimed, “stay, Ellen Bruce, stay—give me one moment's time.” Ellen paused and looked at her with mute amazement, while she walked the room in the agony of indecision. Among other valuable branches of education, Caroline had been taught to G 2 believe in dreams and all their train of vain imaginations; her fancy had been excited by the airy nothings of the night's vision. Ellen's last words struck upon her ear like the voice of prophecy. She imagined that her innocent victim was wrested from her, and that she beheld the visible interposition of Heaven in her behalf—that chasm, that dark deep frightful chasm, yawned before her, and the thought that she could in no way close it up but by the restoration of the rifled treasure came to her like an impulse from a good spirit: obedient to it she had risen from the bed, but she faltered in the execution of her good purpose; she shrunk from the train of evils that her busy thoughts suggested: the certain loss of Westall—Ellen's advancement to fortune, rank and fashion equal to her own—the exposure of her own baseness—that she could not brook; and `I cannot humble myself to her,' was the mental conclusion of her deliberations `When she is gone, I can, if I choose, restore the articles as secretly as I took them; the discovery will then be delayed —Westall secured.' This feeble intention to render imperfect justice quieted her conscience: while she was deliberating what gloss she should put on her mysterious conduct, Deborah opened the door. “Heyday,” said she, “are you up, Miss Caroline? well, I am glad of it, you will have a chance to see the sun rise once in your life; and when he comes sailing over those hills, and pours a shower of light on Champlain, you'll own there is not such a sight in all the Car'linas: good luck, and a husband to you, girl. Come, Ellen, come, what signifies losing any more lost time?” Ellen assured Deborah she was quite ready; and Deborah, who would not on compulsion have performed a menial service for a queen, took Ellen's trunk in her arms, and commanding her to follow `with the nick-nacks,' she left the apartment. Ellen looked inquiringly at Caroline: “I have nothing farther to say, Miss Bruce.” “Then, farewell,” said Ellen. Caroline bowed, and they parted.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XIII. “Lassie, say thon lo'est me, Or if thou wilt na be my ain, Say na thou'lt refuse me.” Burns. The breakfast was soon despatched, and our travellers, after receiving many wise cautions from Mrs. Lenox, and earnest injunctions from James, mounted into an old-fashioned chaise, and commenced their journey. We hope our romantic readers will not regret that our heroine could not be accommodated with a more poetical or dignified vehicle. They ought rather to rejoice that she did not fall upon these evil times, when, beyond a doubt, she would have been compelled to perform the journey in a one-horse waggon—a `kill-devil'—or, to give it its original and appropriate designation—a dear-born; so called from the illustrious author of the invention; a vehicle that commends itself so strongly to the social temper of the Yankees, that it has in the interior of New-England nearly superseded the use of every other carriage drawn by one horse. Our travellers had proceeded a few miles, when Deborah thought she might give Ellen the pacquet with which she had been entrusted, without violating the letter of Mr. Redwood's direction. Her surprise surpassed Ellen's when she beheld its contents. She begged her to read the letter aloud.—Ellen read it with a trembling voice. “The Lord bless his dear heart!” exclaimed Deborah. “Oh Ellen, I wish he had you for his child, instead of that —; never mind, I'll overlook her for the sake of her father—count the money, girl, count it, —you can't,” she added, looking at Ellen, whose eyes were overflowing, “give it to me: my sight is rather dull too,” and she dashed off the tears that clouded her vision, “five hundred is it! you are rich, you are an heiress, Ellen.” “I am, indeed,” replied Ellen, “rich in kind friends, but this money, Miss Deborah, must be returned.” “Returned!” echoed Debby; “why, you would not be such a born fool, girl? a thirsty man might as well pour back a draught he had taken from a fountain. No, no, Ellen, when the rich give, let the poor receive and be thankful; that is always encouragement to them to go on. Returned, indeed! it would be a slighting o' Providence to return it, Ellen— quite out of all reason and nature. Just like one of Mrs. Harrison's superstitious high-flown notions.” It was impossible for Ellen to communicate all the motives that led her to decline a pecuniary favour from Miss Redwood's father; but she suggested G 3 reasons which she thought would appeal to her companion's characteristic independence. The veteran maiden opposed them all—she had advanced into the cold climate of worldly prudence, but Ellen was at that age when sentiment controls interest. In vain Debby continued her remonstrances. Ellen, heedless of them all, wrote with a pencil an affecting expression of her gratitude on the envelope of the pacquet, and reversing it, she directed it to Mr. Redwood, intending to procure at the next village a trusty person to re-convey it to Eton. The travellers had just reached a small brook which intercepted the road: there was a bridge over it, and a road by the side of the bridge, by which passengers descended to the brook for the purpose of watering their horses. Deborah thought it was time to perform that kind office for her steed; she alighted to arrange the bridle, and desiring Ellen to drive through the stream, said she would herself walk up the hill on the other side. The passage to the brook was shaded and hidden by thick clumps of willow trees. As Ellen reined her horse into the narrow way, she encountered Westall, who had gone out on horse-back for a morning ride. “Miss Bruce, is it possible?” he exclaimed, with a tone and expression of delight that changed instantly on noticing her riding dress, and other indications of travelling. “Where,” he continued, “are you going; what can be the reason of your sudden departure?” Ellen communicated as briefly as possible the object of her journey, and the place of her destination. In the meantime the poor beast, quite at a loss to account for the restraint put upon his movements, and not a whit inclined to play Tantalus in full view of the pure tempting rivulet, threw up his head, pawed the dust, and showed all the signs of impatience common on such occasions. Ellen, usually sufficiently accomplished in the art of driving, now, from some cause or other, seemed as maladroit as most women: she pulled the wrong rein, and was, or Westall thought she was, in imminent danger of an overturn. He dismounted from his horse, and springing into the chaise beside her, took upon himself the conduct of affairs. He then, with laudable discretion, permitted the animal to drink, and drove him to the opposite bank, before the conversation was renewed. As he paused there, Ellen said, with the best voice she could command, “I thank you for your assistance; I must proceed now—Deborah waits for me.” “For heaven's sake!” he replied, “let her wait—I cannot, I will not part with you, till I have laid open my heart to you.” “It is unnecessary—I already have heard from Mr. Redwood what you would say,” replied Ellen, confused, and shrinking from the communication, which her conversation with Mr. Redwood the preceding evening led her to anticipate. “From Mr. Redwood?” exclaimed Westall, “impossible! has he then read my soul!” “Not he, but his daughter,” answered Ellen. “His daughter!” reiterated Westall, and was proceeding to entreat Ellen to explain herself, when they were both startled by a hoarse and impatient call from Deborah, who was evidently drawing near to them with rapid strides. “Ellen!” she screamed, “Ellen Bruce, you'll founder the horse; drive out of the brook, girl, if he has not drank it dry already.” The lovers were too much confounded to make any reply, and Deborah, apprehending some fatal disaster to Ellen, doubled her speed, and darting into the path that led to the watering place, quickly arrived in full view of the objects of her search and alarm. There is, to the best natured, something irresistibly provoking in the apparent tranquillity of those who have produced within them all the tumult of anxiety. Deborah, at a single glance, ascertained the safety of Ellen, and of the horse, and approaching the latter, she patted him, saying, “I think you have the most sense of the three; if you had not been dumb, poor beast, you would not have let me run the breath out of my body without answering me a word.” Charles Westall, though his mind was on other thoughts intent, could not but smile at the indirect reproach of Debby, which their truly lover-like forgetfulness of her and of every thing else so justly merited. “Forgive me, Miss Deborah,” he said, springing from the chaise, “your horse was restive, and I assumed your seat to aid Miss Bruce, who was quite unequal to managing him.” “You are a great manager, truly,” replied Deborah, half smiling and half vexed: “the beast seems as quiet now as you could wish him. Is it your will and pleasure, Miss Ellen, to proceed?” “Certainly,” replied Ellen. “Well, come, Mr. Westall,” continued Deborah, whose heat of body and mind had already subsided, “we won't part in anger—young folks must be young folks. Farewell, and a long and a happy life to you.” “Stay one moment, Miss Deborah, I have a favour to beg—I have something to say to Miss Bruce. Miss Bruce,” he added, turning to Ellen, “I entreat you to grant me a few moments—it may be the last favour I shall ever ask of you— Miss Deborah will drive slowly up the hill—the path is shaded from the morning sun—you will not find the walk unpleasant”— “You forget, young man,” interposed Debby, “which way the sun shines this morning; when I came down the road, it was hot enough to boil all the blood in my veins”— “Ellen,” continued Westall, unheeding in his eagerness Deborah's cross-cut, “do not, do not deny me this favour.” “Why, Ellen,” said Debby, “what ails you girl why should you deny it?” This was too direct a question to be answered in any way but by compliance. Some gleams of light had flashed athwart Ellen's mind, that rendered her less reluctant than she had been at the onset, to listen to a communication from Westall. She suffered him to hand her out of the chaise; and Deborah, assuming the reins, and setting off the horse `en connoisseur,' said, she had the advantage now, for if they forgot her, she could ride instead of walking back. The moments were too few and precious to be wasted in circumlocution. Westall, after saying he was sure there was some misunderstanding — Caroline Redwood was the last person in the world to whom he should confide any sentiment that interested him, proceeded to make a frank declaration of the unqualified affection which Ellen had inspired. When he paused Ellen made no reply; and he proceeded, while he urged his suit, to say, with the consistency usual on such occasions, that he knew he had no right to expect a return, that her abrupt departure alone could, and that must, justify his obtruding on her his feelings and his hopes, after so brief an acquaintance. Ellen was all simplicity and truth, and in other circumstances she would not, she could not have withheld from Westall the confession that would have been to him—heaven to hear. She had not a particle of coquetry, and she would not have delayed the confession for a moment for the pleasure of feeling her power. Various feelings struggled for mastery in her bosom; first, and perhaps ruling every other, was the delightful consciousness of possessing Westall's affections; then came the thought of the mystery that hung over her parentage— it had never before inflicted such an exquisite pang as at this moment; and last and most painful, was the remembrance of Mrs. Westall's unkind suspicions, and of the malicious interpretation Caroline Redwood had given to her actions. While she hesitated in what terms to reply, Westall said, “there is then, Ellen, no feeling in your heart that pleads for my rashness?” “It is indeed rashness, after so brief an acquaintance, to commit your happiness”— “Oh, Ellen,” interrupted Westall, “I meant rather presumption that rashness.” “Whatever it is, let us both forget it,” replied Ellen, in a tone of affected calmness that would have indicated repressed emotion to a cooler observer than Westall; “it is time that we should part, and we must part as we met— strangers.” “Have you not, then, Ellen, a spark of kindness for me, which years of the most devoted affection and service might kindle? Is there not the slightest foundation on which I might rest a hope for the future?” Ellen, in a broken voice, alluded to the possibility that her name was a dishonoured one; “a possibility,” she said, “which ought to set an impassable barrier to her affections.” Westall protested and entreated. “If,” he said, “the worst she could apprehend should prove true, it should be the business, the happiness of his life to make her forget it.” Ellen felt that her scruples were yielding to the impetuous feeling of her lover. Who can resist the pleadings of tenderness when they coincide with the secret, the strongest, though the resisted inclinations of the heart? She was silent for some time, and when she did speak, her voice was faltering, and her opposition such as a lover might hope to overcome. Westall's hopes were re-animated, and he pressed his suit more eagerly than ever. “At least,” he said, “Ellen, delay this journey one day; do not now make an irrevocable decision; return to Eton; let my mother join her entreaties to mine.” The thought of Westall's mother re-invigorated Ellen's dying resolution. “Urge me no farther, Mr. Westall,” said she, “I have not been so happy as to obtain your mother's esteem, and were every other obstacle removed, I never would obtrude myself on her undesired; no—nor unsolicited.” “My mother, Ellen?”—But the assurance of his mother's favour, which he was about instinctively to pronounce, was checked by the consciousness of the real state of the case.—“My mother, Ellen,” he continued, in a subdued tone, “has been dazzled by gilded dreams long indulged—but she is kind, affectionate— and will, I am certain, be easily reconciled to any step on which she knows my happiness depends.” “It would not,” replied Ellen, “be very consolatory to me if she should become reconciled to an inevitable evil. I have already listened too long,” she added, and casting her eye towards Deborah, who had halted under the broad shadow of an elm tree on the summit of the hill, she hurried forward. “Can you,” said Westall, “when you see how you afflict me, thus hasten from me without a regret?” Ellen could not trust her voice to answer; but when she had reached the chaise, she turned and gave him her hand: her eloquent face (not governed by the law she had imposed on her tongue) expressed any thing but insensibility. “God reward you,” she said, “for your generous purpose—we must now part.” “And to meet again,” replied Westall, while he fervently kissed the hand she had extended to him, “as surely as there is truth in heaven.” Ellen sunk back into her seat, and hid her face with her handkerchief, while honest Debby, heartily sympathising in the evident affliction of the lovers, said in a whining voice, that contrasted ludicrously enough with her customary harsh tone, “Good bye to you, Mr. Westall—good bye to you, Sir—it is hard parting; but keep a good heart— we shall all three meet again in the Lord's own time.” After having uttered this consolatory expression of her trust in Providence, she gave the whip to her steed, and set off with a speed that promised to make up for lost time. After driving a few yards she stopped again, and calling to Westall, who was still standing as if rivetted to the spot on which they had left him, she threw out Mr. Redwood's packet, saying, “These, with all care and speed, to Squire Redwood;” then kindly nodding, she drove on. Deborah exercised on this occasion that discretion resulting from good sense and good feeling, which in all its modifications still preserves the convenient designation of tact: she left Ellen to the operation of her feelings, without molesting her with a remark or inquiry. Ellen resigned herself for a little while to emotions the more violent for having been repressed. The same fountain had to her sent forth sweet and bitter waters. If the uncertainty of her fate, and the anguish of parting with Westall were evils nearly intolerable, there was a heart-cheering consciousness of the treasure she had acquired in his affections— there was the sweetest consolation in the thought that there was one who felt with her and for her; and the recollection of Westall's last words was like the bright gleam along the western horizon, that, smiling in triumph at the dark overhanging clouds, speaks a sure promise of a fair coming day. As for Westall, after the few first moments of absolute despair, he began to think the case not quite desperate; and though Ellen had not spoken a word of encouragement on which he might suspend a hope, neither had she said or intimated that there existed in her feelings any obstacle to his wishes; there were certain tones and expressions which are the universal language of tenderness, that he had noticed, and which he now laid up in his memory and cherished there, as the faithful fix their eyes on the twilight of prophecy. In the course of the morning, Charles Westall joined the circle at Mr. Lenox's, whither his mother had already gone. He perceived that the tone of the ladies' spirits was raised, (as was indeed too plain) by Ellen's departure. Westall delivered to Mr. Redwood the packet with which he had been entrusted. Mr. Redwood received it with evident surprise, and said, “You have then seen Miss Bruce this morning?” All eyes were now fixed on Westall, who, colouring deeply, replied, “that he had met her accidentally during his morning ride.” “Miss Bruce is quite a character,” said Caroline; “every thing connected with her is involved in an interesting veil of mystery;—par example—your son, Mrs. Westall, cannot speak of meeting her even accidentally, without the most portentous blushes; and there is, my dear father—the very soul of frankness—thrusting into his pocket a bundle of private communications received from this same fair one. Upon my word it is a pity she had not flourished at a court, —she would have made a pretty intri VOL. II. H guante, instead of resembling the man your favourite Moliere describes, papa, when he says, De la moindre vetille il fait une merveille, Et jusques au bon jour, il dit tout a l'oreille.”[2] [2] “He swells each trifle to a wonder's height, And takes his friend aside, to say, `good night.”' Mr. Redwood darted an angry look on his daughter, and changing his purpose, he tore off the envelope, and threw the bank-notes on the table, saying, at the same time, “behold the solution of the mystery that provokes your wit, Caroline. I offered Ellen Bruce a little of that which gives us all our boasted superiority to her, and she declined receiving it”— “With the advice and consent of counsel, no doubt,” answered Caroline, glancing her eye at Charles Westall. “Wrath is cruel, and anger is out-rageous, but who is able to stand before envy?”—rose to Westall's lips; he had the grace, however, to suppress it, and to say in a calm tone, “Miss Bruce is her own best counsellor.” “Doubtless,” replied Caroline, “Miss Bruce is wondrous wise; but she is not the first divinity who has admitted mortals to her deliberations.—What say you, Mrs. Westall? Does not your son look guilty of aiding and abetting this most dignified refusal of my father's extraordinary patronage?” “If I look guilty of aught,” said Westall, “but the involuntary fault of listening to an implication against Miss Bruce, my face does me great injustice.” “Really, Caroline, my love,” said Mrs. Westall, in the hope of averting observation from her son, and perceiving the necessity of turning Miss Redwood from her pursuit, “your raillery is quite too much for Charles this morning: I must interpose my maternal shield. What say you to a truce and a ride?” “A truce, certainly; for I am too H 2 generous to fight with one hors du combat, and a ride with all my heart,” answered Caroline, “provided Mr. Westall is not fatigued by his accidental morning escort—excursion, I mean.” Mr. Westall, with more gravity than gallantry, and in spite of his mother's entreating looks, said “that he must resign the privilege vouchsafed to him, to fulfil an engagement in the village”— and on this pretext he left the party to pursue their design, while he gave the rein to his own meditations.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XIV. “Who made the heart, 'tis he alone Decidedly can try us; He knows each chord—its various tone, Each spring—its various bias.” Burns. We must now leave the party at Eton, which we hope that our readers will think has lost its chief interest since the departure of our heroine, and we shall exempt them from attending her in her wearisome progress, since it was diversified by no danger real or imaginary, to recall their attention to the sorrows of the simple amiable little fanatic Emily Allen. She returned to her monastic seclusion with her aunt, or as she called her (according to the fashion of “the Believers,” who acknowledge none but primitive titles and relations,) her `elder sister,' more from a habit of passive obedience, than from any distaste to the world. Our readers may recollect that at parting with James Lenox, she had received from him a slip of paper, and succeeded in hiding it in her bosom. He had written on it a strong expression of his love, and an entreaty that she would abandon her false religion. From the moment she placed it in her bosom, her heart fluttered and struggled as an imprisoned bird when her mate approaches her cage. She regarded it as a temptation, but had no strength, hardly a wish to resist it. All her solitary moments (they were rare and brief) were devoted to reading this note over and over again. She felt herself immured in a dungeon, and from this the only gleam of light she could not for a moment turn her thoughts. The uniform habits and monotonous occupations of this singular community have a strong tendency to check every irregular feeling, and to intercept every vagrant desire. But in vain did Emily try their sedative influence. She was one of the highest, and even there, where few distinctions obtain, most privileged order, called, par excellence, `the church.' Susan's gifts had advanced her to the lead, and Emily's graces were looked upon by the fraternity as the herald blossoms of like precious fruit. But since her return from her fatal visit to the “world's people,” she had become an object of intense anxiety to Susan, and of solicitude or distrust to the rest of the society. Susan had no suspicion of the real cause of her discontent; she imputed it to the workings of her natural affections, the dying sparks of which, not quite extinguished by grace, had been rekindled by her late visit to her kindred. Little did this stern enthusiast imagine, as she watched over her young disciple with maternal tenderness, how much there was of natural and original feeling in her own affection for her. She saw the bright colour, the beautiful signal of youth and health, fading day by day from her cheeks, till her face became almost as white as the snowy cap border that fringed it. She saw her take her accustomed place at the formal meal, but she noticed that her food was often untasted, and never relished. She observed her slow step and abstracted look, as she passed over the broad flagstones to the offices to perform her daily tasks, and that though she went through them with fidelity, her trembling hands and frequent sighs evinced that her heart and strength were gone. She uniformly appeared with the sisters that thronged to the evening worship, and went forth with them to `labour in the dance,' but her movements were heavy and mechanical; and it was too plain, even to the lenient judgment of Susan, that the spirit was not there. The kind-hearted old women, who thought she was falling into a weakly way, consulted with Susan as to the nature of her complaints. Susan humoured their conjectures, and allowed them to believe they had detected some latent malady. They prepared their simples, and Susan permitted Emily to swallow them, because she knew them to be innocent, and that they possessed that best recommendation of any drug, viz. that `if it does no good it can do no harm.' Some were of opinion that she had an incipient consumption, some that it was only a `drying of the lungs,' some pronounced it an `inward rheumatism,' while others sagaciously intimated that it might be a `palsy of the heart.' In short the wise sisters discovered many diseases that have not yet a place in the H 3 nomenclature of the learned faculty; and poor Emily, without a word of remonstrance or complaint, listened to their skilful suggestions and tried all their remedies, till their materia medica was exhausted, without effect. She took bitters fasting and feasting—she swallowed syrups `nine days' and `three days,' and `every other day,'—she took conserves, and `health waters,' and `life waters,' and every other water that `with a blessing always cures'—but still she had the same deadly paleness—the same sunken eye—the same trembling at the heart—and all the symptoms of a mysterious disease, which the most sagacious deemed nothing short of a `healing gift' could cure. The elder brethren, ever strict in their watch over the young converts, now became alarmed in their turn. They held frequent and long consultations, at which Reuben Harrington had a gift to preside. Whether these veterans derived their light from the experience of similar conflicts cannot be ascertained; but certain it is that they soon came to the decision that Emily's disease was a moral one; and to Reuben was assigned the task of stilling her natural yearnings after the world, and of bringing back her wandering affections to the fold—to the wolf was committed the guardianship of the lamb. Reuben was aware that nothing could be effected without the consent and concurrence of Susan; and to obtain that to the mode of operation which he had proposed to himself, he knew was no easy matter, now that her natural sagacity was stimulated by strong affection and deep anxiety. After the brethren had closed their deliberations, Reuben proposed calling the elder sister to the conference, to advise with her as to the best means of pursuing their righteous end. Susan came at his bidding; but she was cautious and reserved in her communications, till one of the brethren roused her by saying, (after a long low groan,) “It is evident the girl is given over to the sifting of Satan,”—Susan raised her eyes, and fixed them on the speaker— “and,” he continued, “according to my light, she should stand before the congregation of the people on the coming Lord's day, and, in the presence of the chosen vessels, receive an open rebuke for sin.” “What sin, Obadiah?” inquired Susan with a trembling voice. “Sin of the heart—doth not all sin proceed from the heart, woman?” “Verily it doth, Obadiah—but who hath seen the sin proceeding from the heart of this afflicted child?—and who hath given you authority to discern the thoughts and intents of the heart?— would you treat the young lambs like the fat calves of the stall?”— “Nay, sister, this is unprofitable,” interposed Reuben. “It is too true that the fine gold has become dim, and we must seek for a gift to restore its brightness. Let us each labour for it in the evening worship, and he or she to whom it may be given shall forthwith undertake the cure of this precious soul.” Susan did not venture to withhold her assent to this proposition, regarded as it evidently was by the brethren as a direct inspiration, but her spirit still hovered over the child of her affection as a bird fluttereth over her nest. “My light has been,” she said, “to leave Emily to the work of time and grace—but it may be that seeking, brethren, ye may find a quicker cure—it is a duty to remember that in months past the testimony of the child's life against all sin has been very clear. The enemy has taken advantage of her late visit to her kindred, and has carried her back to the path of natural affection, out of which she had travelled far—and seeing nature reviving, and grace sleeping, he hath taken that moment to bind her again with carnal bonds.” “You have ever been gifted, sister,” replied Reuben, “with that hidden wisdom that quickly discerneth. It may be you see the true evil; but even now I can comfort you with a prophecy that the young woman will awake as from sleep, and break these carnal bonds like thread—her conflict is sore, but great will be her victory—for I predict of her as Christian Love, the holy martyr of Cromwell's time, predicted of our mother Anne, that this our young sister shall yet shine out, `a bright star, whose light and power shall make the heavens to quake and knock under.”' “Amen,” exclaimed Susan, devoutly clasping her hands; and “amen” responded all the veteran counsellors in one voice, animated by that vaunted “spontaneous spirit of union which flows through the whole body”—when governed by a master spirit. Susan, on issuing from the brethren's apartment, passed through a narrow passage to the common entry from whence all the passages diverge, and in the centre of which is placed a large clock, the work of one of the ingenious brethren. Emily stood at the foot of the staircase, her face so much averted from Susan, that she did not notice her approach,— her footsteps she could not hear, for it is the law of the society which carries its war with the flesh into the most minute particulars, that every one shall tread softly, and shall shut the doors with the least possible sound—to these laws such due observance is paid, that a stranger ignorant of their habits, would imagine their houses were untenanted. Emily had paused at the staircase from extreme weakness; the loud ticking of the clock had arrested her attention; this sound, always the same, seems like the natural voice of this monotonous solitude. “Oh,” said Emily, unconsciously uttering audibly her thoughts, “to what purpose is time measured here? there is no pleasure to come—there is none past that I dare to remember.” “Do you ask to what purpose?” said Susan, in a voice of unwonted austerity that startled Emily, “and are you then so far relapsed into nature!—Oh, have you already forgotten when every stroke of that clock was as a holy monitor to you, arousing you to redeem the time? —have you forgotten, Emily, when you wrestled with vain thoughts, and sinful thoughts, and overcame them?—have you forgotten, or do you tremble to remember when the stroke of every hour carried with it the record of your innocence.” “Oh, spare me, spare me!” interrupted the poor girl, grasping the elder sister's arm, and clinging to it, “I am sick—very sick.” Susan's heart melted within her at this appeal, and hearing the brethren approaching, she instinctively drew, or rather carried Emily away from their observation, to her own apartment, the door of which she closed, and turned a button that secured her from intrusion. She seated herself, and would have placed Emily beside her, but she, as if desperate now the veil had fallen, sunk into Susan's lap, and folding her arms around her, sobbed on her bosom. This was the language of nature; and the elder sister was surprised into what she deemed an amazing sin. She wept too freely and audibly, but “When she had wrestled down, Feelings her nature strove to own,” and could command her voice, she said, “I thought all these natural affections were rooted out—and they were, Emily; but since you came among us the enemy hath sown tares among the wheat. Poor child! I see where your temptation lies —the world—the world calls you; but be not discouraged, if you overcome the temptation you will be stronger than one that hath never been tempted. This is not the first time that the serpent has entered our garden. Long after I joined myself to the people, my soul thirsted after the world, as the hart panteth for the water courses. “Emily, I have never told you my trials, for I thought the world was as a strange country to you; now you shall know them all, and the Lord grant they may prove a beacon to you!” Susan paused for a few moments, to nerve her mind to the recollection and detail of long past sorrows; and then began in a calm subdued tone, while Emily continued with her face hidden on her bosom, sobbing at intervals like a child that cannot forget its griefs. “Emily, I was the youngest of your grandmother's seven children. My natural father was a good man, living up to the light he had, till our mother Anne, having had a safe path made for her through the waters, came a swift witness to this new world, which being, as it were, born out of due time, was accounted worthy of her ministry, having been, under Providence, discovered and civilized to become the inheritance of the believers. My father, as you have often heard, was one of the first fruits of the work: he and my natural brothers and sisters were among the first that joined the people, and set out for the Lord. I was left alone with your grandmother, and she in possession of all her husband's property—a handsome farm on the other side of the mountain. Emily, I had wicked thoughts then. I believed my family were led away by a deceiver, and an antichrist. I listened eagerly to the stories of those that reviled our mother's name. Some said that she and her elders were the offscourings of the English jails; others seeing that her work far transcended natural power, accused her of witchcraft; some insisted that she was a man in woman's apparel; and although she predicted the independence of this favoured land, and could not act against her own testimony, there were some who charged her with treasonable practices, and threw her into jail. I was willing to believe all that the voice of the slanderer uttered; and when my father came to take me to her, in obedience to him I went, but blinded by my prepossessions. It was then that mother and William Lee and our ancients were gathering the believers at Niskeyuna, and there your grandfather carried me. “We arrived at the close of a November day; the sun had just set in clouds —the sky was dark and foreboding. I had been chilled and wearied with our long ride and fasting; but when we turned from the high road into a woody path, and my father pointing to a smoke that curled upward from a deep wood, said, “there dwells the bright star,” I forgot all the weakness and the wants of the flesh. The adversary put forth all his strength to secure his dominion in my weak and troubled mind;—a trembling seized me—it seemed to me that I was hurried on to a precipice, and I had no power to resist the cruel force that pressed me onward. I tried to pray, but my spirit died away within me. The low murmurs of the little stream along which we rode—the wind that sighed through the naked branches of the trees —the rustling of the fallen leaves over which we passed, all seemed to speak a voice of warning to my fearful spirit. “I was always a feeling and a thoughtful girl, Emily, and it had long been borne in upon my mind that great things awaited me: still I hated the way that was opened, and joyfully would I have turned my back upon the light that was ready to dawn on me. “As we approached the house the believers were closing the afternoon worship; I caught the sound of the evening hymn: it was so ordered, that I did not then, nor till long after, witness the going forth in the dance. My faith was not yet strong enough for it, and for a long time, the Lord forgive me! it was a cross to me. “When we were about to enter the door, my father perceived that my limbs were sinking under me, and he led, or rather dragged me into the room. Oh Emily, I shall never forget that moment. “The apartment, though in a loghouse, was a large one, the brethren having in their early gathering removed all the partitions to give space for the labour worship. There was a bright fire on the hearth from some pine knots, but no other light in the room. The brethren, with their broad-brimmed hats slouched, and casting a deep shadow over their faces, were sitting on one side of the room, as is their custom—the sisters on the other; their arms were folded, and their eyes all cast down; and exhausted by the evening labour they were pale as spectres. Our mother stood in the centre of the apartment alone—her arms also folded across her breast. I looked fearfully around—I saw my natural brothers and sisters, as the flame burned brightly and shone upon their faces, but none of them regarded me. It seemed to me that I had come into an assembly of the dead. I turned to beg my father to lead me away, but he had quitted my side, and taken his place among the brethren. My head grew giddy, and I thought myself sinking to the earth. “At this moment our mother advanced to me; `and is this,' she said, `the one stray lamb that I have so longed to get into the fold?' My bonnet had fallen back—she laid her hand upon my head —her hand and arm were bare, and white and smooth as if they had been rounded out of the purest marble. My hair was dressed after the fashion of the world. `You must forsake these vanities, Susan,' said she:—she did not speak sharply, though she could sometimes sharply rebuke sin:—she made a short pause, and then fixing her clear piercing blue eye steadfastly on me, as if she penetrated to the depths of my soul, she added, in a low solemn tone, `Susan, I bear a message to you—the Master saith, `forsake all and follow me, and ye shall have in this world an hundred fold, and in the world to come, life everlasting.”' “Emily, there was a celestial melody in mother's voice in the gift of speaking, and a weight in all her words, and though I gave no outward sign, they sunk deeply into my heart. She said no more to me at that time—she was never forward to speak. In her looks there was a boldness and an innocence that seemed, as it were, like the truth and the gentleness of the gospel she preached, written for a testimony in every line of her face. “Ah! she had,” continued the enthusiast, her eyes kindling and her face brightening, while her imagination magnified the graces of the leader who had captivated her youthful affection. “Ah, she had all the sweet qualities of woman, and yet Emily, for a season I turned my back on her. I returned to my natural mother—to the world—to—yes it is fitting you should know all my temptations —to one to whom I was deeply bound in my affections.” Susan paused—and Emily's sobbing, which had continued at intervals till this moment, ceased. She raised her face, now gleaming with faint streaks of red, from Susan's bosom, and fixing her eye on the speaker, who after some effort continued, “William Harwood was a pleasant VOL. II. I lad: we had been mates from our infancy, and had loved one another (loving no one else) with that faith which is the boast of the world's people: little did I think till the gospel was opened to me, that that love was the fruit of a depraved nature—that, if I would not perish eternally, it must be plucked off and cast from me. William pleaded for it, and my own heart pleaded more stoutly— Oh, Emily! you know not how the natural man can talk—and oh, my innocent child, be thankful; you know not how the unregenerate heart goes forth in what the world calls love; how the breath of the body and the life of the soul seem bound up in the life and breath of another; how cheap the sacrifice of earth—yea heaven, to the idol seems—” “Oh, stop, stop,” exclaimed Emily, falling on her knees, and clasping her hands in agony, “do not say any more to me, I cannot bear it.” “Nay, my child,” replied Susan, recovering her calm tone and self-command which had for a moment given way before the rush of natural feeling. “Nay, be quiet and listen, for grace obtained the victory. The conflict lasted for many months. I saw that I could in no way be justified but by obeying the gospel and setting out with the believers. Your grandmother hated the faith then as she does now. I could answer all she said, but when William told me with despairing looks that he should be a ruined man if I forsook him, my heart sunk within me. My flesh consumed on my bones as if there had been a curse upon me, and often, often between the setting and the rising of the sun my eyelids have not met, and in the morning I could wring from my handkerchief the tears that had poured from my eyes like rain in the night. But finally grace triumphed over nature: the strong man was bound, and I joined myself to the I 2 people. It is now thirty years since I believed, and,” added she, raising her hands and eyes, and speaking with more energy than she had yet spoken, “I say the truth before God, and lie not: I have not repented for a moment; I have been heartily thankful that I have borne my testimony—I have purchased a peace that cannot be taken away, and cheaply purchased it.” “Then I am lost,” exclaimed Emily. “Nay, do not mistake me, child—I mean that having put my hand to the plough, I never turned back; but I had many heavy dragging hours, much hungering after forsaken joys. It could not be otherwise, but again I say I never repented. You know already that when tribulation came, many fell away. Our mother was carried to prison. My father, your father, all my natural kindred left her—I alone remained to abide our day of wasteness and desolation.” “And did you ever again see William Harwood?” inquired Emily. “Yea, yea, child, that was my chiefest sorrow; he never gave me up—he would not believe that I would persevere in a celibious life and after our family removed hither he came every month and sometimes every week to see me. He once came into our worshipping assembly, but the moment that I went forth in the dance, he fainted and fell to the floor. After that I saw him but seldom.” Susan paused, and Emily asked, “if he never married?” “Nay,” replied Susan. “And is he dead?” inquired Emily. “Wait a moment, child, and ye shall hear it all—yea all. She pressed her hands on her forehead—“My head is giddy, and these thoughts have kindled strange fire in my heart.” She remained silent for a few moments, and then, resuming her usual deliberate manner, she said, “William was an only, and an indulged child. His parents had never crossed him in any thing; and though he had a kind and a tender disposition, he could not brook a disappointment. He fell into a weakly way, and then he took to ruinous habits. His poor old parents died, I fear, of a wounded spirit; for they laid his misfortunes sadly to heart. After their death his worldly affairs went fast to destruction, and he became a miserable vagrant. He would come here and sit for hours on the doorstep; at these times I kept to my room, for I could do nothing for him; and if he chanced to see me in his fits of intoxication, he would either upbraid me bitterly, or cry like a child—and both were trying to me. “It is ten years ago the tenth day of last January; it had stormed for three days, and the roads were blocked with the drifted snows; and it had been a cruel cold night; and in the morning— a Sabbath morning too—when we had risen and kindled a fire, one of the brethren opened the outer door, and there was lying a poor wretch across the doorstone—frozen to death; we all gathered round him; and O Emily, child, it was”— “William?” “Yea—yea—it was William himself.” “Oh misery! misery!” exclaimed Emily, with a burst of sympathy which she could not repress. “Yea, it was misery. I forgot myself —forgot all that stood about me. I saw not his tattered dirty garments, nor his bloated face, but I saw him as in the days of our youth and our love, and I fell on his neck and wept—I could not help it; but thanks be rendered,” she added, raising her eyes, “it was the last struggle of nature, and it has been forgiven.” “And have you suffered thus?” asked Emily, after a moment's pause. “Do not so speak, child,” replied Susan; “rather be grateful that I have been accounted worthy thus to suffer.” Susan's raised feelings did not permit her to add any thing farther. She became silent and abstracted; and Emily, exhausted with her emotions, laid her head in her elder sister's lap, and like a child wept herself to sleep. Susan's narrative had not precisely the effect on the mind of her disciple that she had designed and anticipated. Emily's excited imagination was deeply impressed by Harwood's death, and the instinctive conclusion of her feelings was perhaps as just as if it had been a logical deduction from a process of reasoning. She felt that the faith which exacted such sacrifices, and produced such effects, was stern in its requisitions, and cruel in its consequences. Her fidelity to this strange religion hung, as it were, by a hair—its vibration at the mercy of every passing influence,—unlike Susan, whose strong feelings being set one way by some powerful impetus, were as little liable as a tide of the ocean, to fluctuate from human interposition.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I 3 CHAPTER XV. “Le bonheur se compose d'une suite d'actions et de sensations continuellement répétées et renouvelées; simplicité et monotonie voilà en général ce qui le forme et le constitue.” Madame de Genlis. The Shaker Society at Hancock in Massachusetts, is one of the eldest establishments of this sect, which has extended its limits far beyond the anticipations of the “unbelieving world,” and now boasts that its outposts have advanced to the frontiers of civilization —to Kentucky, Ohio, and Indiana, and exults in the verification of the prophecy, “a little one shall become a thousand, and a small one a strong nation.” The society is distributed into several families of a convenient size[3] [3] No family, we believe, is permitted to exceed a hundred members. Hear and admire, ye housekeepers. for domestic arrangements, and the whole body is guided and governed by “elder brothers” and “elder sisters,” whose “gifts” of superior wisdom, knowledge, or cunning, obtain for them these titles, and secure to them their rights and immunities. There are gradations of rank, or, as they choose to designate their distinctions, of “privilege” among them; but none are exempt from the equitable law of their religious republic, which requires each individual to “labour with his hands, according to his strength.” A village is divided into lots of various dimensions. Each enclosure contains a family, whose members are clothed from one store-house, fed at the same board, and perform their domestic worship together. In the centre of the enclosure is a large building, which contains their eating-room and kitchen, their sleeping apartments, and two large rooms connected by folding doors, where they receive their visitors, and assemble for their evening religious service. All their mechanical and manual labours, distinct from the housewifery, (a profane term in this application) are performed in offices at a convenient distance from the main dwelling, and within the enclosure. In these offices may be heard, from the rising to the setting of the sun, the cheerful sounds of voluntary industry—sounds as significant to the moral sense, as the smith's stroke upon his anvil to the musical ear. One edifice is erected over a cold perennial stream, and devoted to the various operations of the dairy; from another proceed the sounds of the heavy looms and the flying shuttle, and the buzz of the swift wheels; in one apartment is a group of sisters, selected chiefly from the old and feeble, but among whom were also some of the young and tasteful, weaving the delicate basket; another is devoted to the dress-makers, (a class that obtains even among shaking Quakers,) who are employed in fashioning, after a uniform model, the striped cotton for summer wear, or the sadcoloured winter russet; here is the patient teacher, and there the ingenious manufacturer; and wherever labour is performed, there are many valuable contrivances by which toil is lightened and success insured. The villages of Lebanon[4] [4] The village at Lebanon is distinguished as the United Society's “centre of Union.” and Hancock have been visited by foreigners and strangers from all parts of our union— all are shocked or disgusted by some of the absurdities of the shaker faith, but none have withheld their admiration from the results of their industry, ingenuity, order, frugality, and temperance. The perfection of these virtues among them may perhaps be traced with propriety to the founder of their sect, who united practical wisdom with the wildest fanaticism, and who proved that she understood the intricate machine of the human mind, when she declared that temporal prosperity was the indication, and should be the reward of spiritual fidelity. The prosperity of the society's agriculture is a beautiful illustration of the philosophical remark, that “to temperance every day is bright, and every hour propitious to diligence.” Their skilful cultivation preserves them from many of the disasters that fall like a curse upon the slovenly husbandry of the farmers in their vicinity. Their gardens always flourish in spite of late frosts and early frosts—blast and mildew ravage their neighbours' fields without invading their territory—the mischievous daisy, that spreads its starry mantle over the rich meadows of the `world's people,' does not presume to lift its yellow head in their green fields—and even the Canada thistle, that bristled little warrior armed at all points, that comes in from the north, extirpating in its march, like the hordes of barbarous invaders, all the fair fruits of civilization, is not permitted to intrude upon their grounds. It is sufficiently manifest that this felicity is the natural consequence and appropriate reward of their skill, vigilance, and unwearied toil, but they believe it (or affect to believe it) to be a spiritual blessing—an assurance of peculiar favour, like that which exempted the Israelites from the seven Egyptian plagues —an accomplishment of the promise that every one that “hath forsaken houses, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands for my name's sake, shall receive an hundred fold.” The sisters too have their peculiar and appropriate blessings and exemptions. They are saved from those scourges of our land of liberty and equality, “poor help” and “no help.” There are no scolding mistresses, nor eye-servants among them. It might be curious to ascertain by what magical process these felicitous sisters have expelled from their thrifty housewifery that busy mischievous principle of all evil in the domestic economy of the `world's people,' known in all its proteus shapes by the name of `bad luck;' the modern successor of Robin Goodfellow, with all the spite, but without the genius of that frolic-loving little spirit, he who “Frights the maidens of the villagery, Skims milk, and sometimes labours in the quern, And bootless makes the breathless housewife churn, And sometimes makes the drink to bear no barm.” How much broken china, spoiled batches of bread, ruined tempers, and other common domestic disasters might be avoided by the discovery of this secret; what tribes of mice, ants, flies, and other household demons, might be driven from their strong holds. We hope that none of those provoking solvers of mysteries, who are so fond of finding out the `reason of the thing,' that they are daily circumscribing within most barren and inconvenient limits the dominion of the imagination, will pretend to have found the clue to this mystery in the exact order and elaborate neatness of the sisterhood. The sisters themselves certainly hint at a sublime cause of their success, when in reply to a stranger's involuntary admiration of their stainless walls, polished floors, snow white linen, and all the detail of their precise arrangement and ornamental neatness, they say with the utmost gravity, `God is the God of order and not of confusion.' The most signal triumph of the society, is in the discipline of the children. Of these there are many among them: a few are received, together with their `believing' parents; in some instances orphans, and even orphan families are adopted; and many are brought to the society by parents, who, either from the despair of poverty, or the carelessness of vice, choose to commit their offspring to the guardianship of the shakers. Now that the first fervours of enthusiasm are abated, and conversions have become rare, the adoption of children is a principle cause of the continuance and preservation of the society. These little born rebels, natural enemies to the social compact, lose, in their hands, their prescriptive right to uproar and misrule, and soon become as silent, as formal, and as neat as their elders. We hope we shall not be suspected of speaking the language of panegyric rather than justice, if we add that the hospitalities of these people are never refused to the weary way-worn-traveller, nor their alms to the needy; and that their faith (however absurd and indefensible its peculiarities) is tempered by some generous and enlightened principles which those who had rather learn than scoff would do well to adopt. In short, those who know them well, and judge them equitably, will not withhold from them the praise of moral conduct which they claim, in professing themselves as a community, a “harmless, just, and upright people.” It is time that we should return from our long digression to give some account of the spiritual and physical labours of Reuben Harrington. At nine o'clock in the evening that followed the day of the brethren's sage council, the bell, according to the uniform custom, sounded for the evening worship. The brethren and sisters poured in equal streams into the two large apartments, which were now thrown into one by the opening of the wide folding doors. A few candles were hung around the walls, casting a dim and quivering light upon the strange throng. The men took their stations in one apartment, the women in the other, and arranged themselves opposite to each other in straight lines, extending across the room. The eldest were placed in the front ranks—by this arrangement, the young people were saved from the temptation to wandering looks, and their consequence, wandering thoughts—not uncommon in the most orthodox congregations. After a few moments, the deep and reverential silence of the assembly was broken by a shout, in which every voice was simultaneously lifted to its highest pitch. The shout was followed by a hymn, but sung so loud, with such discordant and irregular sounds (for music it could not be called), that it was impossible to distinguish any words, excepting “our mother” and “mother Anne,” which seemed to form a kind of chorus. The singing was accompanied by an equal and steady motion, and alternating from one foot to the other, which resembles to a profane eye the pas bas of the world's dancers. This deafening yell and uniform motion continued till their breath was spent, when all the assembly, as if governed by one instinct, relapsed into silence. They remained as motionless as so many statues, till the profound stillness was broken by Harrington—“ Brethren and sisters,” he said, “we labour this evening for a special gift, and to encourage our hearts, and enliven our faith, it is meet that we should bear upon our minds all those holy men and women of old, who, according to their light, have worshipped in the dance. Sisters, bethink yourselves of Miriam; of Miriam, the sister of Aaron, a prophetess—the first in the female line—who when she sang the glorious triumph of the Lord over the Egyptian host, `took a timbrel in her hand, and all the women went out after her with timbrels and with dances' —remember the daughters of Shiloh, who went `yearly to the feast of the Lord to dance in dances—and king David, who leaped and danced before the Lord, so that Michal, profane Michal, despised him in her heart, even as the world's people in these latter times despise us, and deride our labour-worship. “Ye believers need not be told that the Psalmist justifies his deeds by his words, and exhorts the faithful again and again `to praise the Lord with the timbrel and the dance'—to praise His name in the dance.' Solomon tells us, `there is a time to dance,' and manifestly he could not mean there was a time for those vain festive rites wherewith the carnal children of this world worship their god. Hath not the holy prophet Jeremiah predicted our day in these memorable words, `then shall the Virgin rejoice in the dance, both young men and old together?” When was this prediction verified in the ball-rooms of the world's people? There the young man goes not forth with the aged brother, but selects the fair and youthful maiden for his partner in the dance; and nothing can be more unlike our spiritual labours, than the movements of their bodies, and the exercises of their minds! Again the same prophet saith, `O, Virgin of Israel, thou shalt again be adorned with thy tabrets, and go forth in the dances.”' Here Reuben paused, either to take breath, or because he had exhausted his authorities; and the assembly, without any visible external direction, but apparently in obedience to a common impulse, broke up their ranks,—arranged in pairs, the elder taking precedence of the younger, and the sisters of the brethren, they made in a dancing procession the circuit of the two apartments. A small knot of brethren and sisters remained in the centre of each room, shouting strange music to the dancers, and slowly turning so as to keep their faces always towards the procession, which moved on with a uniform shuffling step, as if it was composed of so many automatons, their arms rising and falling mechanically; and their monotonous movements, solemn, melancholy, or stupid aspects, contrasting ludicrously with the festive throngs which are usually seen stepping on `light fantastic toe,' through the mazy dance. There was but one in all this assembly that seemed to be governed by natural feeling; this was Emily, who, in obedience to the stern requisition of her aunt had come, or rather been dragged into the room; but unable to perform her part of the insane worship, unable in truth to support her own weight, she had sunk on her knees in a recess of the window near which she was standing; her cap had fallen from her head, and laid beside her—her fair hair, thus permitted to escape from its bondage, had fallen over her neck and shoulders, she had covered her face with her hands, and disordered, pale, and trembling, there she remained, till the assembly forming into the procession, exposed her to every eye, looking like a culprit awaiting her sentence. Susan had missed her from her side, and had hoped that she had stolen away to her own apartment, and that her disappearance would remain unobserved. Vain were the elder sister's efforts to command peace in her own troubled mind, when she beheld the humiliating and sorrowful spectacle. The burning colour that flushed her usually sallow cheek, and her unsteady movements, betrayed her affliction. She would have given the world to have sheltered her fallen favourite from the disgrace of such VOL. II. K an exposure, but to move from the ranks was impossible. The elders and the disciplined passed Emily in their rounds without any other notice than a languid and brief glance; but the younger, and especially the children, unable to control their curiosity, gazed on her till their heads were at right angles with their bodies. Suddenly the procession stopped; and Harrington advancing from the ranks, `laboured alone with great power,' and whirling around like a top, to which his form bore no faint resemblance, he continued his violent exercise for an hour; then approaching Emily, and laying his hand upon her head—“To me, brethren and sisters,” he said, “is assigned the task and given the gift to snatch this prey from Satan. The work is to be wrought out in private conference, when words of rebuke, of wisdom, and of conviction will flow from my lips, as the water flowed from the rock at the touch of Moses.—Fear not, young maiden—tremble not—be not thus disheartened—the devil shall release you from his toils, and you shall yet shine out a bright star among the faithful.” The assembly acquiesced silently in the result of Reuben's extraordinary worship. They dispersed to their several apartments; and Susan, without one word of inquiry or reprimand, led Emily to her own room, and spent the silent watches of the night in weeping and praying for her. On the following day Harrington began, and continued for many successive days, his private conferences with Emily. For some time he confined himself to harangues on the peculiar doctrines of his sect. Emily listened dutifully, but the more she listened, the more her growing aversion to them strengthened. He insisted that the net in which Satan had caught her could not be broken, unless she would be governed by his wisdom—guided by his inward light. K 2 Emily sighed and wept, but never attempted a reply. After awhile he changed his tone; he occasionally softened his rebukes with praise, sometimes mingled flattery with his admonitions, and darkly intimated a purpose that he dared not yet fully disclose.—Still Emily listened patiently: she had been always remarkable for singleness of heart, a soft temper, and tender affections, but never for a quick or keen perception. Her mind too had been recently weakened by the hard conflict between her natural affections and her mistaken sense of duty: it was not wonderful, therefore, that she did not distrust Harrington's integrity, nor suspect the meaning that glimmered through his mystical language. He continued gradually preparing her mind for the proposition he had in reserve for her, nothing doubting of its final acceptance; for Reuben, in common with all thorough hypocrites, was quite incredulous as to the existence of goodness, and believed that the seemingly upright only wanted the opportunity and the motive to turn aside from the straight and narrow way. At last impatient at his own slow and serpentine advances to Emily's understanding, and afraid that in spite of her habitual passiveness her patience would be exhausted before he had approached the attainment of his purpose, and hoping too, against hope, that her uniform silence foreboded his final success—he took a bold straightforward step. At his accustomed hour he entered the room where Emily was sitting with the elder sister. He detained Susan for a moment to enquire `if she yet perceived any smoking of the flax —any symptom of revival in the child?' She shook her head mournfully, and slowly withdrew, leaving him alone with Emily with evident reluctance. He then drew his chair close to the poor girl, and taking her hand, (a freedom he had never before ventured upon) and not rebuked by the innocent look of surprise and inquiry which she turned on him, he proceeded to say, in the softest voice he could assume, “You are a worthy maiden, Emily—a chosen vessel—a vessel selected for a great ministry; if you have been cast into the furnace, it is that you may come out as gold seven times tried; the honoured instrument must be made bright and keen in the fires of tribulation. Awake, maiden, awake, and survey the path that I am appointed to open to your view— the path we must travel together; for we are not permitted longer to remain here, mere watchmen on the walls of Zion, but are commanded to march boldly forward to the enemy's camp. “Listen, while I disclose to you the revelation that has been vouchsafed to me. I have obtained a great advance upon the forward wheel; it has been made plain to me that we are together to accomplish a great work—to turn and overturn, till we bring to pass the conversion of the world.” A faint light dawned on Emily's mind, and fearfulness mingled with the amazement with which she had hitherto gazed on Harrington. He perceived that she was startled, but he went on undaunted. “The Israelites were commanded to spoil the Egyptians, and we are permitted, nay, ordered, to take of the lucre (which belongeth equally to our brethren and to us) in order to help us forward in our blessed mission, and to reward our labours. A goodly sum in the bank at Albany awaiteth us. All these matters it is duty for a season to hide from our brethren and sisters; they cannot yet receive them. Our departure must be secret—at night—yea, this night.” Astonished, alarmed, and still uncertain, Emily did not utter a word: her eyes were fixed on Reuben, and looked as though they would have started from their sockets. “Nay, precious maiden,” he continued, misinterpreting her silence, “do not tremble thus—ye need not be alarmed. We have a farther dispensation: as we go among the world's people, we are permitted to be united in wedlock by one of the world's priests.” Till this moment Reuben's meaning had but partially appeared to Emily through the fog of cant phrases in which he had artfully involved it; but his last words, and the fond look that accompanied them, were like the touch of Ithuriel— her persecutor stood revealed in his true light. She snatched her hand from him, and groaning aloud she sprang towards the door—the door opened, and Susan entered. “Oh for mercy's sake save me, take me away!” cried the poor girl, clinging to her aunt in desperation. “What means this?” inquired Susan, looking at Harrington; “have you dared to insult the innocent girl?—Be calm, Emily, my child, be calm.', “Smooth your brow, sister,” replied Harrington, with perfect coolness, “and I will tell all that has passed between us.” “Say on,” she answered, without in the least relaxing her features, “and bear it in mind that I shall know from this afflicted girl, who never opened her mouth to speak a lie, whether ye speak truly.” “My word,” replied Reuben, “will go farther—much farther with the people than that poor fargone sinner's.” “That may be, Reuben, but not with me, therefore speak quickly and truly.” There is a moral power in virtuous resolution that the most vicious find it difficult to resist. Reuben perceived that he could neither conceal nor deny, and that his best, indeed his only policy was to state the truth, and to varnish it K 3 over with the best gloss his ready wit could invent. He said that all his attempts to reclaim Emily had hitherto been fruitless; that as elder sister knew, he had laboured in season, and out of season, and all in vain—all without producing a sign of life in the child. “That morning,” he said, “it had been sent in upon his mind to try her with a temptation, in order to ascertain how far she was under the dominion of Satan; or at least to drive away the dumb devil that possessed her,—in that he had succeeded.” He then went on to detail what he had said to Emily verbatim, omitting nothing but his design on the funds of the society: a circumstance that he rightly judged his last monstrous proposition had effaced from Emily's mind. “And now, sister,” he said, in conclusion, “I think your conscience will tell you that you have judged me with unrighteous judgment; that nature has so far gotten the upper hand of grace with you, that you are blinded, sorely blinded; and henceforth you will feel it to be duty to leave the girl to my appointed ministry.” “Never, never,” replied Susan, firmly: “she has been unkindly dealt with already—nature and grace both speak for the child, Reuben—both tell me that she needs `more gentle usage.”' “But, woman, I have the gift.” “I have a gift also, Reuben; and sooner shall you have my heart's blood, than I will trust this girl with you again; ye need not lift your voice in the congregation; ye need not whisper among the brethren. Remember I am your elder; I fear you not, Reuben; I suspect you.” The determined look with which Susan accompanied her words, quelled Harrington's spirit: he dared not attempt a reply, and smothering an imprecation, he departed to digest, as he best could, his rage and mortification. Susan did not think it expedient to make any farther direct disclosure to Emily of her suspicions of Harrington, but she cautiously questioned and cross-questioned her. Emily, confounded by Reuben's subtlety, and feeble and exhausted, could not remember that he had said to her any more or other, than he had repeated to the elder sister. Notwithstanding the agreement of the simple girl's testimony with Reuben's story, Susan was too sagacious to be deceived by the interpretation the crafty brother had put upon the language he had held to her, and having for a long time felt a growing dislike and distrust of him, she was not convinced that she had been mistaken in her conclusions; and she remained quite satisfied that she had done right in refusing him any farther communication with Emily. Emily's melancholy became every day deeper and more fixed, and Susan began to fear the total annihilation of her mind. She imposed no restraint on her, but permitted her to walk when she chose; to remain secluded from observation in her own room, and sometimes to lie all day on the bed in a state of listlessness and vacuity, in which she appeared scarcely conscious of her existence.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XVI. “Curse on his perjured arts! dissembling, smooth! Are honour, virtue, conscience, all exil'd? Is there no pity, no relenting ruth?” Burns. Emily was one day sitting by her window, when she saw a party of travellers from Lebanon springs stop at their gate. It suddenly occurred to her that she might, through the agency of some one of the party, get a letter conveyed to her friends. The thought that this might be the first step towards leaving the society, flitted across her mind, but without forming any distinct purpose, she hastily penned the letter, which was the occasion of Ellen's abrupt departure from Eton. She then stationed herself at a door that opened into one of the passages through which the visitors were to pass; and arresting the attention of a romantic young lady who was in the rear of the throng, she slipped the letter into her hand, unobserved by any one, and entreating her to convey it safely to some post-office, she disappeared, leaving her confidant quite elated with the trust which had been confided to her by the pale interesting little shaker, and which she discharged, as has been seen, with laudable fidelity. Activity is as necessary to the health of the mind, as exercise to that of the body. Emily derived more benefit from the effort she had made in writing and despatching her letter than she had felt from the combined skill, moral and medical, of the whole fraternity. For a few days her heart was cheered, and her countenance brightened. She had no settled purpose of leaving the society: she still believed it her duty to remain with them, and the tender sympathy and forbearance of her aunt had strengthened the almost filial love she bore her—the only sentiment that alleviated the misery of her condition. Still her belief of Harrington's hypocrisy, countenanced and confirmed as it was by Susan, had shaken her faith in the monstrous pretensions of the believers: she fancied she saw deceit lurking under many a broad brim, and she felt a secret revulsion from the dancing worship, which she had never joined in, or even witnessed since the memorable night of Harrington's inspiration. A few days after the despatch of the letter, and just at twilight—that sweet hour consecrated by all young ladies in their teens to sentiment and romantic meditations—Emily, availing herself of the liberty she had recently enjoyed, strolled out, without any other purpose than to be alone, and think her own thoughts. She had not walked far when she perceived Reuben approaching her. He did not appear to have observed her, and to escape his notice she turned into a little enclosure she had just then reached, which a few broken stones marked as a place of interment. She paused a moment at the graves, and almost envied their silent tenants. The shakers preserve all their austere formality in the disposition of their dead: the brethren and sisters are laid in separate and parallel lines, as if they contemplated the same restrictions in the other world which they impose here: each grave is designated by a rough hewn stone inscribed (with ostentatious humility) with the initials only of the name borne by the person who reposes beneath it. Emily's thoughts naturally reverted to the village church-yard where her father and her mother slept. That seemed a social place when compared with the shaker burial ground. Her imagination pictured the storied monuments— the sacred spot where her parents laid— the beautiful willow that drooped over it, and the neatly carved white stone that stood under its shadow, setting forth in its long inscription their virtues and their sufferings. “Oh, that I was there,” was the involuntary breathing of her spirit. After lingering for a few moments lost in melancholy contemplations, she turned away and pursued her walk through a secluded path to the garden which lay at a short distance from her. As she entered it she passed an old man arranging a bed of violets, which with many other beautiful flowers obtain sufferance among these ascetics on account of some real or fancied medical virtue. “I am glad to see ye, child,” said the good-natured old man. “I think ye are picking up a little, and I am heartily glad to see it: I would not have you a drooping lily all your days. It is a short pilgrimage through this world, and a thorny path it may be, but seeing it leads to the garden of Paradise, it is not worth while for a reasonable person to worry with the troubles by the way; they can't last long—that is a comfort,” continued the speaker, striking his spade into the earth and resting upon it. “I have seen mothers wailing for their firstborn as if their very souls died with them, and in a few days, or a few years at worst, that passed away like a vapour, they too were cut down and lying quiet beside them. I have seen children withering away like a severed branch at the death of their parents, and a frost has come and nipt them in their flower. I have seen people wearying themselves for riches and honours, and just when they had got them, leave them all for the shroud and the cold earth. I tell you, my young sister, life is a short journey, therefore don't be discouraged if the road is not quite to your liking.” Emily made no reply to this kind exhortation, but she plucked some of the violets and asked the old man, if they were not sometimes called “heart's ease?” “Yea, I believe some folks call them heart's ease.” “And do they grow no where but on the believer's ground?” she asked. “Yea, yea,” replied the man, smiling significantly, as if he understood the import of her inquiry; “they grow all about among the neighbours — every where.” He paused and looked at Emily for a moment, and then casting his eyes in every direction, and ascertaining there was no one in hearing, he lowered his voice and said, “I believe you to be a discreet, good little body, and that you'll keep the counsel I give you to yourself. You are wearied with this kind of strange, still life, child—your mind is running upon your relations, your home—may be upon some sweetheart—now ye need not look so frightened, it is nat'ral, it is nat'ral—I don't blame you for it. I always feel sorry to see a young and tender plant put into soil it don't love; it never takes root fairly—never thrives. Now, my advice is that you pluck up courage, tell the people the plain truth, go home to your friends, get a good husband, and `guide the house.' Ye can take scripture warrant with you, for its God's own word, that `in every nation, he that feareth him and worketh righteousness is accepted of him.”' Emily with very natural surprise gazed at the old man as if she discredited her senses. “Are you a shaker?” she asked. “A shaker, girl!” he replied, laughing—“yea, and a very good shaker.” His muscles contracted as he added, “I have been what is called an unfortunate man in the world. Every thing went against me. I lost my wife, my children—lost my property—and I thought I could not do better than to get a shelter in this peaceable place; and as I had a remarkable gift for gardening, the people were glad to have me with them.” “Then you are not a shaker?” said Emily, bewildered by the contrariety of his motives with those she had always heard professed by the shakers. “Yea, but I am, that is to say, in the main a believer. Our people are foolish about some things, but then I never saw any religion but there were some weeds among it; and to speak truly, I am too near the end of my summer to care much where my leaves drop; but it is a pity you should be growing, nay, growing you are not, but withering in the shade: say nothing, but store my counsel in your heart, and let it bring forth its fruit in season:” thus concluding, the kindhearted old gardener turned away and left Emily to reflect on his singular communication. Though not a very skilful reasoner, she came to the just conclusion, that such shakers as the crafty Harrington and the frank gardener, were not shakers by divine impulse; that the ties which attached others to the society were not in all cases indissoluble, and the society itself did not exist by prescriptive divine right. She sought a sequestered part of the garden, and seating herself in the shade of some fruit-trees, and as she thought secure from observation, she drew from her bosom the precious little scroll which linked her to the world. All that was there written was more legibly inscribed on her heart, but still she loved to look on it. The sight of it touched her imagination like a conjurer's wand, and brought before her all those images she most loved to dwell upon. She resigned herself to the visions of her fancy, forgot the formal habitations around her, the severe brethren and the pale sisters; and was restored to the Lenox family, joining in their bustling occupations, sharing their pleasures, the object of the kindness of all, and the chosen, loved partner of James. She beheld her old grandmother cheerful and approving, Ellen Bruce smiling on her with sisterly kindness, the merry faces of the children; she heard their unrebuked mirth, Debby's loud laugh; she saw and she heard all, till awakened from her reverie by an approaching footstep, she looked up and beheld Harrington coming towards her. She instinctively started on her feet, and intending to restore the scroll to its hiding place, she unconsciously dropped it. As she walked hastily past Harrington homeward, he said, “Stop, Emily— stop, my good girl—I have something particular to say to you.” “I cannot hear it now,” she replied, redoubling her speed. “You cannot!” muttered Reuben, looking after her: “the time will come when you shall hear me—and hear me patiently and quietly.” Provoked at being defeated in his purpose of speaking to her, he remained where she left him, whetting his resentment and brooding vengeance, when the note she had dropped caught his eye. He took it up, and read it. “Ah now,” thought he, “I see the reasons why my fair offers were received with horror and disdain — the little fool has a younger sweetheart— but she shall find the old fox an overmatch for the young hound.” Never did a vulture fasten his talons around his victim with more exultation than Harrington thrust poor little Emily's lost talisman into his pocket—he did not see exactly how he should turn it to account; but it gave him power, and power in his hands was the sure means of mischief. It would not be very edifying to thread all the intricate windings of his bad mind—to examine the projects he conceived and dismissed, till he devised VOL. II. L one which flattered him with the hope of the certain destruction of his innocent victim, and with the prospect of complete vengeance on the elder sister, who he well knew was vulnerable alone through this object of her natural affection. Subtle and active, it was not long before his plans were matured. Two days after he had obtained possession of the note for which Emily had anxiously and vainly sought, he came on some pretext of business into an apartment where she and one of the sisters were sitting. Emily felt as strong an impulse to leave the room as if a venomous reptile had crept into it, but afraid of attracting the notice of a third person, she remained with as much tranquillity as she could command. After a few moments, a traveller chanced to pass in a waggon. Emily's companion was attracted to the window. Harrington followed her, and looking earnestly at the traveller, he said carelessly, “That young man favours James Lenox—it is possible it may be him”— he paused, and Emily instinctively sprang towards the window. Reuben looked at her, and conscience-smitten, she shrunk back into her chair. “I am told young Lenox is in these parts,” pursued Harrington, “and I judged he might ride over here to see some of his old friends.” Again he turned his eyes on Emily, hers met his— her face and neck were crimson. “I wish, Judy,” said he, to the young woman who was still gazing out of the window, “that ye would go to the sewingroom, and inquire if my coat is finished?” Judy went, and Emily rose to follow her. “Stop, Emily,” said Harrington, in a low voice, and unobserved by Judy, laying his hand on her arm, and closing the door, “with all your gettings, get discretion, young woman: your ready step, your burning cheeks, would this L 2 moment have betrayed your secret to me, if I had not known it before. Nay, now you must hear me—be calm, do not tremble, we have no time to waste—take this note,” said he, restoring her treasure, “and be thankful that it fell into friendly hands. The hint I gave you was spoken in earnest: James Lenox is in Lebanon. The silly boy sent a letter to you sealed; it fell into my hands; it was my duty to open it, and my duty, as you well know, I perform at all risks— here it is.” Emily hastily caught it without observing the diabolical sneer on Reuben's face. “Now mark me, young woman,” he continued. “I see it is a vain struggle you are keeping up—ye cannot abide here; and as you are of the earth earthy, I cannot counsel you to abide—you shall see that I am your friend, and will return good for evil. Lenox urges you to join him at Lebanon: he thinks if he comes here, ye will not be able to resist the open opposition of the people—ye'll read his letter, and ye'll find this is the last day of his stay in these parts; and if ye do not join him before to-morrow, he concludes you are still in bonds to the believers. “I have had the letter in my possession four days, and you may thank yourself that you have not got it sooner; ye have fled from me as if I had been a tiger, or a rattle-snake. Now mark me, if you take my counsel you'll go to-night quietly and secretly. Little as you deserve it from me, it is in my mind to help you: if you will come to the supper-table with your cap tied, I'll take it for a signal that you are determined to go, and I will be ready one hour after sunset with a waggon and horses, just at the turning of the road that leads to North-house. I wish to go thus early that I may return before day-light, for it is not needful the brethren should know that I take up for you. They might not view your departure as I do; for after all it is but acting up to your light, which is all we profess to require. Now go, young woman, and the Lord direct all your steps.” He gazed after her as she passed through the passage, and exclaimed, exultingly rubbing his hands, “I have caught her—I have caught her at last. Let the fox but clear the ground, and the old one may bark till doomsday.” It was some time after Emily reached her own apartment before she became sufficiently composed to read the letter: her head swam, and her hands shook violently; but at last, making a great effort, she did read it. It was filled with passionate declarations of love, and earnest and repeatedentreaties that she would join the writer at Lebanon, where he said he should await her four days. He alleged many very plausible reasons for not coming to the village. He rested his earnest suit mainly on his ardent, devoted attachment to her; but at the close of the letter he insinuated that if she did not return to Eton with him, her grandmother's death must lie at her door, so much had her desertion of the poor old lady shattered her health and spirits. Emily perused and re-perused the letter; she felt her cheeks burning while she read it, and she wondered that James should write in a style so impassioned— `surely he ought not,' she thought, and the next moment mentally accused herself of injustice. `Alas,' she said, `if my heart beats thus at the bare thought of meeting him, can I blame him if he talks in the fashion of the world's people?—my head is in such strange confusion, that it may be I do not understand him aright.' But every other consideration was swallowed up in the necessity of coming to an immediate decision whether to go or remain. Emily's convictions, as they had been deemed, had gradually subsided as her early attachments revived, and her inclinations for the world strengthened; and now, no strong tie remained to be broken but her love for the elder sister, which had produced such habitual dependence on her, that she had become a mere machine governed by a power which she could neither understand nor resist. There was now a demand on her for extraordinary energy, she must act independently, promptly, and secretly. Her mind was tempest-tost, and while the sore conflict lasted, reason threatened at every moment to abandon the helm. Much cause as she had to distrust Harrington's integrity, she did not on this occasion doubt the sincerity of his kindness. Her mind was engrossed by the great circumstance of her departure, and she scarcely thought of the means by which it was to be effected. Once, indeed, the thought flitted across her mind, that Reuben's compassionate interference in her behalf was very strange, and for the moment she felt an almost invincible repugnance to trust herself with him; but there was no alternative, she had no other means of meeting James. She could, it was true, declare her resolution to leave the society. No one was ever detained by physical force; but to a weak and irresolute mind there are moral barriers that are as impassable as prison-walls, and Emily felt that she had not the courage necessary to persevere against the deliberate opposition of the society, to withstand the counsel, rebuke, or sneer that she must expect from the different characters that composed that strange community, and above all to meet the elder sister's eye. But how could she bear to deceive her, to steal away from her tenderest friend as from an enemy! The thought of making this treacherous return to her maternal kindness quite overcame the poor girl, and L 3 Susan entering at this moment, found her wringing her hands and sobbing most piteously. “What has happened to you, Emily, child?” she asked, in her kindest voice: “this distress is something more than common with you.” Emily made no other reply than by throwing her arms around Susan's neck, and hiding her face on her bosom. “Nay, child,” said Susan, folding her arms around her, “ye must not. It is but a tempting of Providence. Ye'll be quite worn out in the struggle, and if ye cannot conquer, why—ye had better yield.” `Now, now, if ever,' thought Emily, `is the moment;' and she raised her head from Susan's bosom with the full purpose of confessing her weakness and her wishes. But when she lifted her tearful eyes, and saw the calm fixed resolution marked on the elder sister's face, and met her eye in which there was the majesty of command, it awed her spirit as that of man is said to awe the inferior animals. Her head fell again on Susan's bosom. “Ye are a strange wayward child,” said she: “I am sorry to leave you at this moment,” she added —“nay, do not start, I shall return to-morrow.” “To-morrow!” echoed Emily, “Yea to-morrow; and Judy has promised to keep you company to-night. One of the elders at Lebanon draws near his end, and they have sent for me, to consult upon some temporalities to be settled before his departure. Now sit down and compose yourself—it troubles me to leave you thus.” Susan led Emily to a chair, and at this moment one of the sisters gave her notice that the brethren were already in the waggon and waiting for her. While she hastened her preparations, she exhorted Emily to be more tranquil, and above all not to permit any one to see how far the adversary yet maintained his power over her. Emily, though she groaned aloud as the door closed after the elder sister, suffered her to depart without any farther communication. She passed the remainder of the day in severe struggles; but finally, at the close of it, she came to the supper-table leaning on Judy, with her cap tied; and one hour after, having evaded her companion's observation, she stole, unnoticed by any one, to the appointed place of rendezvous, where she found Harrington, and took with him the road to Lebanon. Harrington, for reasons all important to himself, abandoned the road usually travelled, and turned at the western extremity of the village, into one which passes in a northerly direction over the mountain to the town of Lebanon. There are on this sequestered road but two or three habitations for a distance of several miles, and though it presents many enchanting views of the uplands and vallies, and ought therefore to attract the lovers of the picturesque, few of that (in our country) small and select class ever heard of it; and business travellers preferring the more levelled and turnpike road, this remains unfrequented and grass-grown. The necessity that Harrington should reach Albany with all possible expedition, and execute his business there before it was practicable that he should be overtaken, forbade his permitting Emily to remain in ignorance of his purposes, and he had scarcely passed the boundary of the village, before he began to unfold them to her. His language was entirely changed—all the mysterious phrases, and the obscure and technical words, with which he was wont, as he expressed himself, to `sanctify his discourse,' to guard it with equivocal meanings, and veil it in unintelligible terms, were exchanged for the concise language of the man of business. Emily soon comprehended that she was the dupe of his arts —`that the decoy letter was forged by him, after the model of the note, (he, as he boasted, holding the pen of a ready writer)—that James Lenox neither expected nor wished for her—and finally, that her reputation being destroyed by her elopement with Harrington, her only resource was to proceed with him, without any ado, to the nearest justice, who could perform the marriage ceremony, to accept his hand, which he generously proffered, and then pursue her way with him to Albany, where he insultingly concluded he should possess himself of a sum of money that would enable him to make a lady of her for the rest of her life.' Emily heard him through with dismay; and springing from his side, she would have cleared the waggon in an instant, but he perceiving her design, passed his arm around her, and pulled her back on to the seat, and there detained her in his strong grasp. She screamed for help with reiterated cries, and the only answer she received was, “be quiet, sweetheart—you spend your breath in vain—there is nothing in these woods to hear you but the bats and owls —no `elder sister' to snatch you from me.” “Oh!” exclaimed Emily, turning to him with a look of helplessness and appeal that might have awakened compassion in a tiger. “Oh, do pity me.” “Pity you, indeed!” he replied; “I have none of that article on hand: I used it all upon myself while I staid among those devilish fools. Take wit in your anger, girl—what can't be cured must be endured. I foresaw that I should have trouble with your stubborn nature, and I have provided accordingly. But fair play is a jewel, and the Lord knows, I would like to treat you handsomely, if you will hear to reason and let me.” They had now nearly attained the summit of the hill, and Harrington stopped his horses. “Now, Emily Allen,” said he, “I leave it to your free choice to go with me to the first justice we can find, and there quietly, and as it were, willingly, be lawfully made Mrs. Harrington, so that man can't put asunder what God joins together—or abide here, where I have bespoke a cage and a keeper for you till my return, when you will be glad enough to take me on my own terms.” Emily listened in silence to the particulars of the wretch's plot against her: her whole frame trembled, and her lips quivered: she made no other reply than by attempting again to scream for help, but her voice was so faint and incapable of articulation, that it sounded like the smothered cry of a person attempting to scream in the agony of a frightful dream. “Well,” said Reuben, after pausing but a moment, “if you won't hear to reason, you must e'en abide by the consequences.” He then turned his horses from the road into a deeply shaded passage through the woods, where, by the imperfect star-light, not a trace of a footstep could be discerned. The way however had been used, during the winter, for the transportation of wood to the neighbouring villages, and was sufficiently cleared from impediments, to allow the cautious Reuben to pass slowly and safely through it. Emily looked around her in utter despair—she cast her eyes up to the heavens as if to appeal for mercy there —their stillness and serene beauty seemed to mock and aggravate her misery: she tried to frame a mental petition to the only Power that could rescue her, but her mind was so shaken by terror that she could not command her thoughts for the effort. They had proceeded about half a mile, and Harrington again stopped. A bright light streamed through a vista in the woods on their right. Emily looked in the direction whence it proceeded, and saw, through the open door of a hovel, a human figure enveloped in a blanket, and extended on the ground before a blazing fire. The light played fitfully on the figure, now almost dying away, and then streaming upward nearly to the aperture in the roof through which the smoke found its way. Happily imagination could not aggravate her terrors, and now fully aware of her own helplessness, she sat as still as if she had been turned to stone, while Harrington vociferated “Holla! Sooduck—doctor! the devil take the lazy loon, is he asleep or drunk?” Reuben's repeated calls at length roused a dog, whose head laid on his master's bosom, and his barking awakened the sleeper. He raised his head, shook back the long black locks that shaded his eyes, and looked around as if uncertain whence the sound had proceeded. “Who's wanting the doctor?” he asked, in a surly tone: “fools—will they never learn not to come to me at the moon's full?” He then drew his blanket around him, and was about to resume his sleeping posture, when Harrington roused him effectually. “Here, Sooduck,” he screamed, “here I am on the spot; have you forgotten, old fellow? Here is the jug well filled, and here is the girl.” “Ah! is it you, friend Reuben? Here I am, true as steel, watching for you.” “A devil of a pretty watch you keep,” muttered Harrington. “Come, come along, doctor, I have no time to lose, every minute is worth a golden guinea to me.” The old man moved slowly and with difficulty towards the waggon —“why how now, Emily, girl,” continued Harrington, “it's hard parting, is it. She clings to me, doctor, like a bur.” “What have you brought here?” asked the old man, looking inquiringly at Emily, who, quite spent with terror, had sunk insensible into Harrington's arms. “No, no, friend,” he added, turning away, “since the breath is gone, I'll have nothing to do with her: it is bad luck meddling with the dead, and there was no death in the bargain.” “Stop, you old fool,” exclaimed Harrington. “Fool, I may be, friend Reuben, but I'll not be fool to a fool—I tell you again I'll not undertake with the dead.” “Excuse me, doctor,” said Reuben, in a moderated soothing tone, “you have mistaken your case for the first time in your life: the girl is no more dead than you or I—she is as fearful as a fawn, Sooduck, and your old Indian face has frightened her out of her wits—she is faint too, poor little sweetheart, with grief at parting. Here, take the jug first,” he added, well knowing that he offered an argument irresistible to Sooduck: “there is life of man for you, doctor—it will make your lazy blood race through your old veins again, and warm your cold heart to do a good turn to a friend.” “Ah Reuben, Reuben,” replied the old man, grasping the jug and swallowing a draught from it, “you know what is needful. The stuff,” he added, after repeating the application, “has put life into me already—now give me my prisoner and be off.” Reuben, with the little aid that Sooduck was able to afford him, succeeded in lifting Emily from the waggon and conveying her to the hut, where he placed her on some fresh straw that appeared to have been provided for the purpose, and then left her, enjoining it on the old man to watch her narrowly and treat her kindly. After having once gone to the waggon, he returned to advise Sooduck to administer a sleeping potion; `it would save trouble,' he said, `and make safe work.' “Never you fear, friend Reuben,” replied Sooduck; “trust me and my dog to guard this little she pigeon.” Harrington thought there was in truth very little to apprehend, and he departed exulting in the expectation of the final success of his savage scheme. Emily soon recovered from her fainting fit, but she passed the night in a state of nervous excitement, little short of distraction. Before morning, however, she sunk into a quiet sleep, in consequence of a composing draught, which Sooduck half compelled and half persuaded her to swallow. Repose had its usual beneficent effects, and she awoke with the first beam of daylight quite tranquillized. She had now for the first time sufficient presence of mind to examine her prison and her jailor. The hut was about ten feet square, and constructed of slender poles well secured in the ground, and bent together at the upper extremity in the form of an arbour: the sides and top were filled in with flexible brush-wood, closely matted together. Some brans and ashes, the relics of the evening's fire, laid on and about two flat stones, which composed the fire-place. A chair, so rough that one might have fancied it the first barbarous essay towards forming that indispensable domestic article; an iron pot, and two skillets, were the only furniture of this tenement, rude as the rudest structures of the primitive inhabitants. The remnant of an Indian cake, laid on a scorched board near the firestones, and some trout, that had been caught the preceding day in a mountain stream, were languidly moving in a large wooden bowl nearly filled with water. Sooduck, still stupified by the copious draughts he had taken from Reuben's jug, was stretched on a mat before the door—his dog laid beside him. The faithful animal ever and anon would start from his sleep, look inquiringly around him, lick his master's face, and fall asleep again on his bosom. Sooduck the Indian (for such he was) had all the peculiarities of his race. Though so old that he looked as if `death had forgotten to strike him,' his gigantic form was still erect and muscular. In vain Emily explored his long face, as the increasing light of day revealed its rigid lines and worn channels, for some trace of humanity, some signal of compassion; but it was a visage to pierce the heart of one who sought for mercy with utter despair—a visage in which brutal sensuality was mingled with a fierceness that neither time nor events could tame. She remembered to have heard this man described, and marvellous medical skill imputed to him. She recognised some of the signs of his profession hanging around the interior of his hut; strings of the rattles of rattle-snakes—skins of snakes —snakes salted and dried in the air— bunches of herbs and roots—the plumage of birds—their carcasses and eggs—in short, he seemed to have levied his contributions equally on the elements of earth, air, and water. There are still, in the most civilized parts of our country, some individuals of the aboriginal race, who, like the remnants of their sacrifice-rocks, remain among us monuments of past ages. They seek the most secluded and wildest spots, where the face of nature, yet untouched by man, expresses some sympathy for them—owns an alliance with them. Some of them are pretenders to medical skill, and receive the significant appellation of “root doctors.” They no longer affect to possess the charms, and use the spells of the ancient pow-wows, but their preparations are made with a studied secrecy which, by its influence over the imaginations of the vulgar, answers the purpose of magic. Without taxing our VOL. II. M credulity to believe in all the marvellous cures that are ascribed to them, we see no reason why the simples they extract from the bosom of our kind mother earth should not prove as innocent and quite as efficacious as the drugs of the foreign soils. Every one has felt the inspiring influence of returning day-light—the most timid are emboldened by it. Emily inhaled the cool and fragrant morning air: she saw through the open door the dewy foliage glittering in the sun-beams, and the cheerful light that chequered the shaded foot-path, and the still voice of nature seemed to whisper encouragement to her spirit. She heard the shrill voice of the lark, and the clear note of the robin, and they sounded in her ear like the voices of her familiar friends. Exhausted as she was by long sufferings and recent terrors, hope nerved her to attempt her liberty. The rattling of the straw, as she moved from it, startled the vigilant dog; she saw him fix his eye upon her, and looking around for some means of diverting his attention, she espied a piece of dried meat hanging over the door; she cautiously took it down, stooped over him, and patted him coaxingly, while she offered him the tempting bribe, but he shook off her arm, and with a low growl expressed his disdain of her arts. Finding the dog impracticable, she trusted that he would not be able to awaken his master from his deep sleep, and stealing timidly around his feet, and having attained the threshold of the door, she ascertained by one fearful glance, that he still slept soundly, and rashly bounded over the door-step; but she was suddenly arrested by the dog, who having jealously watched her stolen movements, now sprang after her, and caught her garments between his teeth. While she made an effort to extricate herself, the yelping of the animal awoke M 2 his master, who growled on her more fiercely than his dog. She turned towards him, and sunk on her knees, and with tears and entreaties besought him, “as he hoped for that mercy from Heaven, which he would so soon need, that he would have mercy on her.” He heeded her no more than if she had spoken to him in a dead language; and after gazing on her for a few moments, silently, and with a mixture of sullen anger and brute indifference, he commended and caressed his dog, and then pulled the helpless despairing girl into the hut. She sunk back on her straw bed, while Sooduck, apparently unconscious of her sobs, and even of her presence, proceeded to make preparations for his breakfast. He first whetted his appetite by a copious draught of Reuben's liquor, and then kindled a fire, on which, without any fastidious preparation, he threw the still gasping trout. When they were but half roasted, he offered one on a piece of Indian cake to Emily, who, as might be anticipated, rejected his hospitality, though her fast had been a long one. Quite unaffected by the scruples of his guest, Sooduck devoured his savage repast with a voracious appetite. He then left the hut, secured the door as well as he was able with a stout cord, and attaching his dog by his collar to a chain which was fastened in a staple driven into one of the upright posts, he left the trusty animal to guard his prisoner, while he with his pole and line sauntered to a little brook near his dwelling, but hidden by a thick growth of trees which it nourished on its sides. Emily remained stretched on her rude bed, now giving way to a burst of grief, as the recollection of the past, or the gloomy portents of the future over-powered her, and now relapsing into profound silence, rendered more grievous by the sweet music of nature, which struck on the poor prisoner's sickening sense. The melody of the birds, as they flew about her prison-house, breathed freedom and gladness, and the brook, which she distinctly heard as it gurgled around the roots of the trees that impeded its way, or bounded over the stones that vainly obstructed its free passage, conveyed to her the song of liberty. She was sometimes startled by the shrill whistle of the Indian, who, still pursuing his drowsy pleasure in the shelter of the wood, sent his greeting to his dog, whose hoarse response answered the purpose of the sentinel call of “All is well!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XVII. “Proud of her parts, but gracious in her pride She bore a gay good-nature in her face, And in her air was dignity and grace.” Crabbe. While the transactions so fatal to the peace of Emily Allen were going on, Deborah and Ellen were quietly pursuing their journey, though not as expeditiously as Ellen could have wished. She had not, as has been seen, left Eton in the most tranquil state of mind; and she was perhaps more impatient at the little accidents that retarded their progress, than she would have been at another time, or under other circumstances. Sometimes the old racked chaise needed repair—sometimes the horse, who, as Deborah said, “had, like herself, seen better and stronger days, and needed to be favoured,” required a day's delay— and sometimes they came into the neighbourhood of an old acquaintance or faroff cousin of Deborah's, and she judged it right to diverge from their direct route to prove to them her friendly remembrance; for she scrupulously maintained the New-England custom (which among the degenerate moderns is becoming a little unfashionable) of noticing a relative to the remotest degree. Ellen often felt inclined to remonstrate against these repeated delays; but Deborah was so much accustomed to exercise the petty tyranny of having her own way, that Ellen rightly concluded it would be much easier for her to acquiesce, than for Deborah to relinquish her habitual control. Ten days had elapsed, when they stopped at a village inn in the vicinity of the shaker settlement at Hancock: an hostler advanced to take charge of the horse: Deborah, before she resigned the reins, gave to him the most minute directions as to the refection of her beast; but the man, puffed up with the transient importance which he derived from an unusual concourse of travellers that had filled the stables and stable-yards of the inn with fine horses and fine equipages, was evidently quite heedless of Miss Debby's directions. She at last had recourse to the usual expedient of travellers, and though she utterly disapproved the use of such appliances, which she thought were little better than bribery and corruption, she reluctantly drew a fourpence-halfpenny from her pocket, and giving it to the man, with the air of one who offers ample consideration for `value received,'—“Here,” said she, “take this, and deal kindly with the beast — poor fellow, he has had a tough morning of it, what with the heat and the hills.” The hostler took the bit of money, M 3 looked at it, and turned it over with mock gravity, balanced it on the end of his finger, as if weighing it, and then tossed it high in air, accompanying this last expression of his contempt with an insolent laugh, in which he was joined by half-a-dozen of his associates who had gathered around him. Deborah picked up the money as it fell, and deliberately replacing it in her pocket, said with perfect coolness, “A fool and his money are soon parted— this is a right punishment for my giving in to these new-fangled ways. Here, fellow, give me the reins, and call the master of the house to me.” This appeal to his principal reduced the menial to his proper insignificance, and turned the laugh against him, and Deborah remained fairly mistress of the field, till the landlord made his appearance. The raised voices of the different parties attracted several persons to the windows and door of the inn, and Ellen felt herself rather awkwardly situated as she stood awaiting the termination of Deborah's arrangements. “Walk in, Miss, walk in,” said the landlord to her: “here, this way, in the parlour: the house is considerable full, but you'll find room enough to spare yet — I'll attend to your mother—walk in.” The attention was now withdrawn from Deborah to Ellen, and each observer probably noticed the disparity between the supposed mother and daughter. “Impossible,” whispered a young man who stood in the door-way to a lady beside him; “that she-grenadier cannot be mother to this pretty graceful girl.” “Impossible is a rash word for you, Mr. Philosopher,” replied the young lady: “look there,” she added, pointing to a prickly pear in flower, “there are strange productions—odd relations in nature.” Ellen's ear caught enough of these remarks as she passed along, to inform her that she was the subject of them; and her embarrasmeut was increased when the landlord opened the parlour door to usher her in, and she perceived that the room was already occupied by a large party of travellers—she shrunk back, and begged her conductor to show her to a private apartment. He said that was impossible, for his rooms were all taken up. The young lady at the door observed Ellen's embarrassment, and advancing, with a mixture of good-nature and graceful politeness, begged Ellen to enter. “Our party,” she said, “is of such an unconscionable size! We travel en masse like the patriarchs—men, women, and children—and much cattle, and when we have gained possession of a territory we are quite terrible; but the parlour of a country inn you know is neutral ground, where all parties have equal rights.” A smile and a bow from Ellen expressed her sense of the proffered courtesy, and she passed and seated herself at an unoccupied window. “You are a rash woman, Miss Campbell,” said the gentleman in a low voice, whom Ellen had first seen at the door, and who had followed her to the parlour. “I see a storm lowering on Mrs. Norton's brow, and I fear she will not permit you the privilege of neutrality.” “I care not, Mr. Howard—the motto of my family arms is, `dauntless in war, gentle in peace.”' “My family's boastful motto also,” replied Mr. Howard. “Indeed!” exclaimed Miss Campbell, “that is singular; but I hope you are not ashamed of it,” noticing a little embarrassment in Mr. Howard's manner. “Oh, certainly not; though one might blush at thinking how little we degenerate sons can do in these peaceful times to verify the pretensions of our fighting forefathers—but see, the storm is ready to burst on your devoted head. Mrs. Norton is beckoning to you—and even that look of invincible good-nature which you have assumed will not mollify her.” Mr. Howard's eyes followed Miss Campbell with an expression that seemed to say, `that look is as potent as the beauty that in the olden time disarmed the wild beasts of their ferocity.' “My dear Miss Campbell,” began Mrs. Norton, drawing up her severe features to as stern an expression, as if she was taking up her testimony against the depravity of the age. “My dear Miss Campbell, I really wonder at you.” “Wonder! Can you, Mrs. Norton, condescend to so vulgar an emotion as wonder?” “But I am serious, Miss Grace.” “So I perceive, ma'am.” “There can be no doubt, I fancy that you understand me?” “Indeed I have not that pleasure.” Few things are more mortifying to a person of self-consequence, than to be called on to explain the cause of a personal irritation, which he had imagined quite obvious. After a little fidgetting on her chair, and clearing of her throat, all which Miss Campbell awaited with the most provoking serenity, the lady spoke with the manner of one who in her own little sphere had been looked upon as quite oracular. “Miss Campbell, it has ever been my opinion, confirmed by all my experience, and I have had more than most people;”—she paused again, probably from the difficulty of giving sufficient dignity to a very small subject, and Miss Campbell slipped in—“Incontrovertibly, ma'am, few people live to be more than three-score.” “I did not mean, Miss Grace, the experience of age; every one who lives to a certain time has that—but the experience of—” “Wisdom, ma'am—sagacious observation, &amp;c. &amp;c. I understand you.” “Oh, cousin Grace, you are such a tease,” said a young lady who sat at Mrs. Norton's right hand, and who perceived she was quite as much provoked by being understood, as by not being understood. “Your cousin Grace,” said Mrs. Norton, “may teaze you young ladies, Miss Sarah, but I assure you that I am not a subject for teazing.” “My dear Sarah,” said Miss Campbell, with affected gravity, “how could you suspect me of taking such high aim —you know mine are all random shafts, and if they wound, are `heaven directed;' but, Mrs. Norton, pray do not deprive me of that valuable opinion of yours— the result, if I remember, of unparalleled experience.” “I shall not be deterred from expressing it by your ridicule, Miss Campbell; self-respect renders one quite superior to ridicule.” Self-respect renders one quite superior to ridicule,” repeated Miss Campbell with deliberation and emphasis—at the same time taking out her pocket-book, seemingly with the purpose of recording on her tablets Mrs. Norton's saying— “self respect,” she again repeated, as she drew out her pencil, when Mrs. Norton stopped her by exclaiming— “Do you mean to insult me, Miss Campbell?” “Insult you! my dear Mrs. Norton, Lord bless me! no—really if I have been so unfortunate as to misunderstand you again, you must not lay all the blame on my poor intellects; for you talk so much in the style of the venerable Greeks, to such a dissultory personage as I am every sentence sounds like an apophthegm.” Mrs. Armstead, the aunt of Miss Campbell, thought her niece was carrying matters too far—she perceived that Mrs. Norton felt as awkwardly as a warrior of the olden time who should be in his heavy coat of mail, assaulted by a light armed soldier of the present day. “My dear Grace,” she said, “you have not allowed Mrs. Norton time to explain herself. She noticed the companion of the young woman, towards whom you have thought proper to give yourself such an air of patronising hospitality, in an altercation with the hostler—she says she is an excessively vulgar woman, and she thinks, my dear, that it is a great piece of presumption for this young woman to come into our parlour without an invitation, and rather ill-advised in you to encourage her assurance.” “Thank you, my dear aunt,” replied Grace Campbell, bowing her head with affected deference, “for possessing me of Mrs. Norton's views of my conduct; and now, my dear madam,” she added, turning to Mrs. Norton, “pray do not withhold from me your own expression of your golden opinion.” Mrs. Norton had strong motives for keeping well with Miss Campbell: she was conscious that the lady's fortune, fashion, and talents placed her in the first class, let her make that class as small as she would. She had been excessively provoked at Miss Campbell's contempt, or at best indifference for her, but, having no alternative, she made to herself a great merit of forgiveness, obliged to suppress her wrath against Miss Campbell, she meant to indemnify herself by wreaking her vengeance on the innocent stranger, and when she spoke, she spoke calmly, but loud enough to be heard by Ellen. “Miss Grace,” she said, “there is much excuse for one who is ignorant of the presumption of the common people: you have lived for the most part in town, where you did not come in contact with them.” “Yes—unfortunately, Mrs. Norton, but I have now and then taken a trip to the country, and indemnified myself for the privation. There is nothing in life so tiresome to me as the genteel gentlemen and ladies one meets for ever in town—we flatter one another's prejudices—we adopt one another's opinions and tastes and habits till every thing individual and peculiar is gone—we are all formed in the same mould, and all receive the same impression—pure gold and base copper—all must bear the same stamp to be current coin. It is a refreshment to me to see the natural character as it is developed in the strong peculiarities one meets in the country. I love the common people—an unpardonable sin it may be, Mrs. Norton, but I do love them—I love to see the undisciplined movements of natural feeling—I sympathise with their unaffected griefs— I love to witness their hearty pleasures— I had rather receive the expression of their cordial good-will than the compliments of a successful winter's campaign—” “For heaven's sake tell me, cousin Grace,” said a gentleman who was standing near to her, “are you addressing this tirade in favour of rusticity to Mrs. Norton or to Howard?” A deep blush suffused Miss Campbell's, cheeks; she was conscious that though she had in the onset addressed herself to Mrs. Norton, she had involuntarily, and in obedience to the impulse of sympathy, directed her eyes to Howard. the blush was followed by a beautiful smile, as she replied to her cousin—“Is it strange, William, that my enthusiasm in behalf of the contemned and neglected should impel my eyes instinctively to a Howard?” “Beware instinct, Howard—instinct is a great matter,” whispered young Armstead, and added aloud, “do not bow so like simple Mr. Slender, as if you believed every word of that rattlebrained cousin of mine. She has drank a draught of sentiment this morning on these romantic hills; but this love of the country and its sweet simplicity is not her first love: she will return to town, and run the course of fashion and folly with the swiftest of her rivals.” “For shame, my son: I will not suffer your insinuations against Grace,” said Mrs. Armstead; “I am sure she was never fond of dissipation.” “Oh no, my dear mother; dissipation is a self denying ordinance with Grace; and the admiration of half the men, and the envy of all the women, are her voluntary mortifications.” “Ah, Will,” replied Miss Campbell, “you are a snarler—a predestined old bachelor—but you shall see that I will deny the world and all ungodliness— forswear your company, and live soberly in this present life.” “I am certain Miss Campbell has the ability to verify the prophecy she utters,” said Howard. “I see it is all in vain, my good friends,” retorted young Armstead, assuming the gravity of a sage; “you pour in your poisons faster than I can administer my antidotes; so go on, and in a few years you will drive my cousin Grace, in spite of her good sense, into the rank of the infallibles: our dear mother would even now persuade you, Grace, as the worthy Bishop Hoadley said, `not that you cannot err, but that you do not err.”' “My good aunt's blindness is not likely to prove fatal to me while I have so clear-sighted a cousin, who with one keen glance of his eye can pierce the fog of vanity. But here, William, comes a newer if not fairer subject for your sharp-shooting.” All eyes were now directed to the door, and Deborah entered. The pause occasioned by her entrance gave Mrs. Norton an opportunity to speak, and obliged others to listen to her. She poured forth many wise maxims upon the necessity of jealously guarding the few distinctions of rank that remained among us, and concluded with the condescending declaration, that she always made it a point to speak to persons she met at an inn, but she took good care they should understand, `thus far shalt thou come and no farther.' Young Armstead ventured to express a fear that the wave of the multitude would be too strong for her supreme command; but for the most part the good lady talked without being heeded. Every eye seemed fixed on Deborah, who on entering had given a good natured nod to the Armstead party, and had proceeded in her operations with as much nonchalance as if she had been in her own little bed room at home and mistress of all she surveyed. She walked up to a small looking-glass—threw aside her bonnet, and began smoothing her refractory locks with a pocket-comb, while she recounted to Ellen, in her homeliest phrase, and with the exultation of a victor, her success in securing the best hospitalities of the manger for her good steed, and boasted that like a faithful mistress, she had insisted on being an eye-witness of his accommodations. It must be confessed that Ellen felt a little disturbed at the ludicrous figure her companion made in the eyes of the fashionable party who were observing her. She perceived that the mirth of the young people was only kept within decent limits by the gravity of their elders, and that gravity was maintained by a difficult effort. She averted her eyes and looked out of the window, when Deborah who had finished her VOL. II. N toilette, and was surveying some pictures that garnished the walls, again exacted her attention. “For the land's sake, Ellen,” she said “come and look at these pictures and tell me what this means—here is something that puzzles me;” and she fixed her eyes on an embroidered Hector and Andromache, the fruit at least of three months' labour of one of the young lady artists of the inn. “That man,” she said pointing to the Trojan hero, “is dressed in the uniform of the Connecticut reg'lars, at least it is as much like that as any thing, and I take it to be the likeness of Col. Smith. I remember he had a wife and one child, and he parted from them just before the battle of Garmantown, where he lost his life, and a great many other brave fellows that have never been stitched into a pictur, lost theirs too. It's always your generals and colonels that get all the profit and honour while they live, and the glory when they are gone, while the poor fellows that suffer hunger and cold die, and are never named nor thought of. But what signifies it; for the `same event happeneth to all,' as Solomon says.” “And it is the honest life that precedes the `event,' and not the honour which follows it, that makes all the difference,” said Miss Campbell, advancing to Deborah, and entering into her feelings with evident pleasure, “Very true, Miss—and very well said,” replied Debby, heartily. “Maybe Miss,” she added, with an earnest manner, which indicated that a very slight observation of Miss Campbell had inspired a great respect for her powers, “maybe Miss, you can help Ellen explain these outlandish names that puzzle me. I am sure there was not in all the Connecticut reg'lars such a name as Hector, and as to the other, I can't make any thing out of it.” N 2 “They are fancy names I imagine,” said Ellen, willing to avoid an explanation. Deborah passed on to a coarse engraving of Solomon's temple, which she gazed on with at least as honest a rapture as a connoisseur would have felt at the cartoons of Raphael. She commented on its length, breadth, and depth, with critical accuracy, observed the number of porches, pillars, windows and doors, and concluded with expressing her delight that she had `at last seen a pictur of old king Solomon's temple.' Deborah poured forth her comments without heeding the whispers, the stares and smiles that her oddity excited; but Ellen saw and heard all; and more pained that her honest friend should be the subject of ridicule, than mortified on her own account, she drew her out of the room into the little piazza in front of the house, and earnestly recommended their proceeding on their journey immediately. Her arguments however had no weight with Deborah; but while she still urged them, their attention was attracted by an alarming outcry. The cause of it was at once obvious. A chaise had been overset in the village street, the horse was running with the broken vehicle at his heels at full speed, while half a score of men where in breathless pursuit; a little child stood in the road before the door, his danger was apparent, and his destruction seemed inevitable: the party in the house joined their cries to those in the street, while a voice of terror and agony loud above all the rest, screamed, “my child, my child!” The horse received a new impetus from these frightful screams, while the little fellow stood facing the danger quite unappalled, and resolutely threw his hat at the horse. Deborah and Ellen darted forward at the same instant—Deborah attempted N 3 to stop the horse: she failed in that, but the force of her arm turned him aside from his course, while Ellen snatched the child, and turning, placed it in the arms of its mother, who had just reached the door, and trembling, almost fainting, extended them to receive her child. This was all the operation of an instant. The whole party from the parlour now surrounded Deborah and Ellen. Mrs. Armstead, (for she was the mother) as soon as she had tranquillized her feelings sufficiently to speak, overwhelmed the preservers of her child with expressions of gratitude. The brothers and sisters crowded about, and embraced the little boy who seemed to wonder why he had caused such emotion; while Miss Campbell advancing to Ellen, and gracefully offering her hand, said, that her “llittle 'scape-death cousin had obtained for her the right to beg the name and acquaintance of her whose kind intervention had saved his life.” She proceeded to lavish praises on Ellen for her prompt courage; but Ellen modestly declined them, saying, she had been impelled by instinct to the action, and was quite unconscious of any danger till it was past. The ice being thus broken, the young ladies, after discussing every particular of the `hair breadth 'scape,' proceeded to an animated conversation on various subjects, which elicited the characters of each, and inspired them with mutual admiration. Perhaps they liked each other the better because, though there was a general agreement between them in tastes and sentiments, there was a striking difference in some particulars. Ellen's manners, without any of the awkwardness or gaucherie of bashfulness or ignorance, were timid, and, with strangers, rather reserved and retiring; while Miss Campbell had the assured air of one who has held a high command in society, and whose right and habit it was to take the lead in the world of fashion. Ellen, with one of the sweetest voices in the world, talked in rather a low tone—the style of her conversation was unambitious and simple, and though it often took a rich colouring from the bright rays of genius and feeling, like those glowing hues which fall on the summer landscape, and which no contrivance of art can produce or imitate, there was nothing said to court attention or excite admiration. Miss Campbell talked rather loud, and with spirit and fluency; she had the fearless manner of one who has often felt her own power, and the weakness of others: she dashed on like an impetuous mountain stream, disdaining obstruction and careless of opposition. She had evidently been accustomed to occupy the fore-ground of the picture, to be the primary object of attention. She would have been at a loss to comprehend the feeling that suffused Ellen's face with blushes, and imparted tremulousness to her voice, when she found herself the object of an admiring observation. Miss Campbell had been so accustomed to the homage of society, that the excitement had become as necessary to her as the applause of an audience to a popular actor. In the midst of her most animated and eloquent sallies, her eye would glance rapidly around her circle of auditors, to catch new inspiration from the silent tribute of their enchained attention. With these faults, she had such a fund of good sense, such invincible good humour and unaffected benevolence, that she commanded the love, the respect even of those who were most sensible of her imperfections. Her virtues were her own, the luxuriant growth of a rich soil; her faults the result of accident, the weeds permitted by neglect, or occasioned by improper cultivation. Miss Campbell was not a regular beauty, but her graceful person and fine expression gave to her appearance the effect of beauty, Mrs. Armstead, her aunt, resided in Philadelphia, and was on a jaunt to Boston by the way of Lebanon springs. Mrs. Norton was an old acquaintance and distant relation, whom she had met accidentally. Mr. Howard had been introduced by young Armstead into his mother's family a few weeks before they left home, and recommended to their regard as an old college friend from Boston. This introduction is necessary to our readers, but even these concise particulars are more than our travellers ascertained of their new friends. The little boy who had been rescued seemed to have been struck by the manly genius of Deborah, and attached himself to her—and the whole party, with the exception of Mrs. Norton, were emulous of showing civility to Deborah, and admiration of Miss Bruce. Mrs. Armstead, anxious to improve her brief opportunity of expressing her gratitude, lavished her attentions on Ellen, placed her next herself at table, and melted away all reserve by the warmth of her kindness. The dinner being over, preparations were made for the departure of all parties. Deborah's primitive looking chaise and ancient horse, were led to the door in the rear of Mrs. Armstead's elegant carriage, which with the dashing gig and tandem of her son, and the horses of their outriders effectually `stopped the way.' While the servants were adjusting some light baggage, dried fruits and cakes for the young people, the late publications for their elders, &amp;c. &amp;c. Miss Campbell said to Ellen, “you must allow me to borrow a New-England phrase, to ask whither you are `journeying?' we cannot part from you without the hope at least of meeting again.” “It is not impossible we may,” replied Ellen, “for my companion has just announced to me, that if we are successful in attaining the object of our coming to this vicinity, she intends visiting Lebanon springs for a few days.” “Successful or not successful, Ellen,” interrupted Deborah, “I shall go to the pool, for I hear those waters are a master-cure for the rheutmatis.” “Oh, I am told quite equal to Bethesda,” said Miss Campbell; “and as you take along with you an angel to trouble them, you may be sure of experiencing their efficacy. But seriously, Miss Bruce, I hope no consideration will deter you: we are to linger in the adjacent villages for a day or two, and then go to Lebanon, and I am certain that if we are so happy as to meet you there, my aunt will insist on your attaching yourselves to our party.” “Grace,” said Mrs. Armstead, “you anticipate my wishes—you would indeed, Miss Bruce, do me a great favour by enrolling yourselves in my party.” And the young ladies exclaimed, “how glad I shall be—and how pleasant it will be.” Ellen gracefully returned her thanks to each and all, while Deborah, quite ignorant of the tactics of the polite world, comprehended nothing of the offered civility, but that it was meant in kindness, and therefore deserved the hearty thanks which she replied to it. “Come my dear girls,” said Mrs. Armstead, “we must despatch this leavetaking; every thing I see is in readiness.” “Our friends,” said Miss Campbell, “must start first. Be good enough, William, to order the servant to lead forward VOL. II. O Miss Lenox's horse. I am sure,” she added smiling, “his age and virtues entitle him to precedence.” The two parties now proceeded to make their adieus; and the young ladies, each as they took Ellen's hand, slipped on her finger a ring, which they begged her to take for a keepsake. The little boy, watchful of every thing concerning his new friends, observed this—he drew from his pocket a net purse, through the interstices of which shone a golden guinea, and swelling with manly pride, he offered it to Deborah. Deborah patted him on the head, called him a young prince, said his life was worth saving, and as a matter of course she handed the purse to his mother. “Oh no, no, Miss Lenox,” said Mrs. Armstead, “you must keep it indeed, it would quite break my little boy's heart if you despised his gift.” “Despice it, ma'am,” rejoined Deborah, surveying it with unfeigned delight. “I was never the owner of a golden guinea in my life, and I thought it would be an imposition to take it— but I shall take good care of it,” and she carefully deposited it in her pocket, adding, “Mr. John, your guinea will seldom see daylight while I live.” The last parting words were said—the last kind looks reciprocated, and all parties arranging themselves in their own places, Deborah drove off in one direction, and Mrs. Armstead and her suite in another. As the children stretched their necks out of the carriage to send their last lingering look towards the old chaise and the humble Rosinante that drew it heavily along, Mrs Armstead remarked, “how little the young and the truly wise estimate that which is essentially good and lovely by external appearances.” “As I cannot in conscience, my dear aunt,” said Miss Campbell, “take a place in either of those classes, being not very young and certainly not belonging to the `select few' of the `truly wise,' I must investigate the cause of my prompt admiration of our new acquaintance.” She shook her head after a moment's deliberation, and added, “I can take no praise to myself, for that charming Miss Bruce is a self-evident lady—and her companion—an exception to all rules —just hit one of my wayward fancies.” “And I rather think, Grace,” said young Armstead, (who had taken his sister's place in the carriage,) “you were not sorry to have an opportunity of giving to our cousin Norton a practical instance of your contempt of her aristocracy—and of manifesting to another observer your elevation above the prejudices of society.” Miss Campbell did not notice the last clause of her cousin's sentence except by a slight blush: she pleaded guilty to the desire of mortifying the baseless pride of Mrs. Norton. “There was nothing,” she said, “more essentially vulgar than the consequence that betrayed, by its perpetual vigilance and jealousy, a consciousness that there existed no intrinsic superiority—an exclusive bigoted spirit ought not to receive any toleration in our society—it was opposed to the genius and tendencies of every thing about us—we were happily exempt from the servitude of oriental castes, and the scarcely less arbitrary classifications of more liberal countries. Superior talents—education—manners—the habits of refined life, were the only distinctions that ought to obtain among us, and they were quite obvious.” “Ah coz, I see how it is. Like the Duchess of Gordon, who replied to the managers of the city assembly at New-York, when they apologised for not being able to offer her the precedence to which her rank entitled her, `never mind, Gentlemen, wherever I am, there is the Duchess of Gordon.' Like her Grace, you are satisfied that Miss Campbell's is the first place—that modern heraldry of merit will always give precedence.” “Thank you, William, for your generous personal application of my principles —you need not shake your head—I am in no danger of mistaking any thing you say to me for a compliment.” “Believe me, Grace,” replied her cousin, affectionately taking her hand, “I never was in more imminent danger of joining my voice to the coral song of your flatterers. I sympathise entirely in your desire to dissipate the illusions of our conceited, and thank Heaven, `faroff' cousin Norton—in your admiration of our new acquaintance, and in some other new feelings,” he added, lowering his voice to a whisper, “that are getting the mastery in your heart—and I pray heaven you may always shew yourself as entirely superior to the adventitious distinctions of the world, as with your character you may afford to be.” “A bona fide compliment from William Armstead!—Saul among the prophets!” exclaimed Grace Campbell.
