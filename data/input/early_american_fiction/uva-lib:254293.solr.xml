      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER I. THE GAZELLE KEEPER. `So shone the sun upon the arrowy Guadalquivir, when Spain was ruled by a Christian, and the Cross of God rose where now the Moslem Crescent gleams!' These words were slowly and sadly spoken by a venerable, apostolic-looking man with a lofty and towering form, a pale, thoughtful brow, and features of the most noble outline. He wore a garment of close cloth, girded by a thong of untanned leather about his waist, and descending to his feet, which were sandalled with untanned hide, strapped with cords across his naked feet. To his brown-hued coarse robe was attached a hood, which hung down his shoulders, leaving exposed his fine silvery head and commanding brow. His beard like a cataract of shining snow, descended into his bosom and was lost there. His eye was as clear as light and as gentle as that of a maiden's, white his pure complexion was as soft as an infant's, the effect of rigid abstinence from animal aliment, and of many a long fast and wasting vigil. There was a lustre and transparency to his countenance that seemed to belong more to heaven than to earth—an ethereal, saint-like expression that gave it an aspect almost divine. The words he had uttered fell unexpectedly and startlingly upon the car of a young man seated at his feet upon a rock, which, being near the Sierra Morena, commanded a wide and magnificent prospect of the green vale of the Guadalquivir, and the silver white towers and dark walls of Cordova upon its banks. He was a young shepherd of tha Sierras by his garb, which was a baregan of dark cloth fastened at his neck by a loop of leather, bound with a girdle of goat's hide, and terminating at the knee, which, with half the leg, were encased in coarse mountain boots of dried skin. By his side was a rudely-made hat of palm leaves, with the brim thriee the breadth of the crown, and also a strong oak pike, seven feet long, terminating in a hook, not unlike a shepherd's crook. His age was not more than three or four and twenty at the most; yet the mountain life he had led matured a nobly developed form, which was moulded as if it had been the original for the Greek Apollo. Though his cheek was as brown as the chesnut of his native Sierras, his face was remarkably handsome and lighted by an eye at once soft as the gazelles and piercing as that of the mountain eagle. He was reclining at his ease upon a rock, which stood upon the very pinnacle and outer verge of a cliff that towered a thousand feet from the valley in a sheer precipice. He had been collecting his goats and gazelles, of which he had a flock numbering more than one hundred, and having gathered them from the nooks and shelves and peaks of the mountain, whither they had dispersed themselves seeking the scanty herbage of the heights, be gaided them into the rocky pathway which led down the mountain side home ward, and here turned aside, as he was wont to linger and gaze upon the fair valley, lighted up with the splendor of the setting sun. And a fair and glorious sun it was that made the goat-herd loiter on his homeward path till often the shadows of night would hasten upon him and render his passage down the steep footway perilous even to his practised tread. Beauteous as the Vale of Paradise itself, the verdant plain of the golden Guadalquivir lay before his admiring and wistful eyes. Terminating on the south at the majestic wall of the dazzling Sierra Nevada, whose purple sides were finely blended with their snowy crests, and embraced in the north by the encircling arms of the Morena Mountains, with the beautiful river meandering through its green bosom, its banks studded with cities and towers, and lovely with groves and gardens, it seemed truly to be, as it was termed by the Moors, `the guarded emerald of the earth.' In the midst of the charming valley sat Cordova, upon a throne of towers, the Queen of all the fair scene. Upon her hundred minarets sparkled the crescent of Islam, and from the bosom of her groves rose side by side with the cathedral of the Nazarene, the Mosque of Omar. A league from the base of the mountain, along a winding road, a party of travelling merchants, with their long train of laden mules and horses was visible, making its way from a pass in the hills towards the city, ere the gates should be closed for the night; and off the road, beneath a grove of stately palms, that flung their delicate shadows far across the green plain, were assembled a caravan of Moorish travellers, with one or two camels and many horses and mules, some laden, others garnished with gay trappings, while here and there moving about the picturesque encampment, were seen cavaliers in turbans and embroidered vests. The eminences along the face of the Sierras, were frowning with castle and tower, many of them in ruins, yet all adding to the effect of the picture spread before the eyes of the young mountaineer. He had reclined at first upon the rock, and gazed with a subdued look of enjoyment; but gradually his eyes lighted up, and an expression of decision, not untinged with melancholy, passed across his handsome face. It was at this moment, that the words spoken by the hermit fell upon his ear. Upon hearing his voice he started quickly to his feet, and turned towards the speaker and knelt with an air of reverence upon his knee, while he said earnestly, `Thy blessing, father.' `Thou hast it, son!' responded the hermit, laying his hand upon his head. The young man kissed the hand with affectionate veneration, and then standing up said— `You are far from your cell, father, for this hour. It will be night ere you reach it, and the way is perilous to one of thy years! Let me guide thee, father.' `Stay, not yet, son. I will sit here and rest with thee. This stone is a sacred seat. 'Tis said the Holy Paul when he first preached in Spain the cross of the Crucified, was five days wandering among these mountains, to which he had been driven by those in Cordova, who would not hear his doctrine. He was secreted here by a converted Israelite, and from this rock gazed upon Cordova as we do now.' `How knowest thou this, father?' asked the young mountaineer, reverently, stepping aside from the spot, and gazing with holy awe upon the little recess in which he had been reclining. `Tradition, son, which never suffers ought to perish touching the followers of the Messiah.' `And tradition, father, says that Paul from this rock shook off from his feet the dust of the city, and said, prophetically, `Thou hast rejected the Cross; therefore thou shalt wear the yoke.' `And that yoke, father?' `Is the crescent—and a grievous yoke has it been this twenty years to Cordova. The rule of the Moslem is a punishment of Heaven upon the land that proved itself unworthy to bear the foot of an apostle. Yes, my son, in the rule of the Moor we behold the retribution which was denounced upon yonder city. As now it shines in the setting sun, fair and glorious to the eye it shone twenty years ago the pride of a Christian King, and Christian people. But then the sun lighted up no infidel crescent. A thousand crosses flung back his beams. Look! can thy young glance espy even one lowly symbol of Christ in all this vale of beauty? `The crescent is everywhere, father. I see no cross.' `No. Not one is left standing. The sign of the False Prophet usurps even upon the Temples of God, the place of the Son of Man. The church is desecrated into a mosque; and the muezzin calls the prayer from the tower in which once chimed the vesper and matin-bell. It is a sad sight, my son, for the eyes of a Christian man to gaze upon. But prayer and faith will yet avail to turn aside the judgment that is upon us. Penitence and deep humiliation among the great and the rich, aye among the priests of the altar, are needful. This has come upon us for the worldliness of the church, the licentiousness of the priesthood. God has bridged the sea to the infidel, and given the fair lands into his hand to waste and to pollute. Let me lean on thy shoulder, my son, I will accept thy guidance. `Willingly, holy hermit,' answered the young man as he placed the hand of the venerable recluse upon his shoulder and turned to support him up the mountain to his cell, which was situated at least four hundred feet higher than the lofty projection on which they were standing. `Not this way, my son. I go down into the valley,' he said, pointing down the steep path, that was lost to the eye, a thousand feet below in a ravine, in the shadows of which lay half-buried a shepherd's hamlet. `Then you have just come down from the summit, father?' `Yes; I have an errand of mercy below to-night.' `It is not often you are found out of your cell, father, when the evening star rises over the peak;' said the young man, as he directed his steps away from the cliff-verge and began to descend a precipitous goat-track, that wound down the western side of the Sierra. Slowly they descended together, that youth and aged man, the younger supporting the elder with tenderness, mingled with reverence. The sun sank into a bed of purple clouds, and the soft shadows of advancing twilight began to fall over the beautiful scenes of the valley. The city with its towers and walls, and arching domes, melted into a golden haze, that each instant grew browner and more obscure, till the minarets of the mosque could no longer be distinguished from the tall shafts of the palm-tree that towered about them. The river soon caught the light of the first star, and shortly after the moon, like the half of a large pearl, rose over the Sierra and flung its chaste radiance over grove and river, and softly beaming upon the crescents which the sun had so lately left. Steadily, and firmly, and with the affection of a son, the young mountaincer guided the steps of the noble hermit amid the gathering darkness and gloom of the way; and ceming at length to a small ledge, which projected about a hundred feet above the hamlet, in the ravine beneath, they paused there to rest. `Thanks, my son. Thy arm is as strong as it is willing. It is not often that I need other aid, even in this mountain path, than my own strength. But I have not been well of late! `Thou dost fast too often, I fear father!' `Nay, it is grief rather than abstinenee that hath weakened me.' `And how much farther than the hamlet do you intend to go, father; for I will accompany thee?' `Not far; but I need no aid when I reach the plain. But who comes this way down the glen? A hunter, and by his garb a Moor.' The place where they stood was a shelf in a winding path, that led from a mountain pass to the summit of one of the boldest of the Sierras. In the defile itself at the foot of the path was nestled a hamlet of a dozen humble herdsmen's huts, perched here and there upon the rocky banks of a wild torrent.— About one hundred feet above the torrent, and level with the spot on which they were resting, ran a path through the defile, and so to the summit of the mountain to the rear. Both of these paths that led through the defile, and that descending from the cliff by which they had terminated on this natural platform, and joining, formed a single path down to the hamlet. Along this defile way a person was advancing alone, a green silken turban upon his head, and a rich, scarlet Moorish shawl bound round his waist by a morocco belt, to which hung his curved scymeter. His figure was strikingly elegant and commanding. His costume sparkled with silver and jewels. He was slenderly built, had a fine expressive black eye, and handsome features. But his face was now flushed, and his bearing highly excited. He wore a dark mustache. On seeing the two strangers he assumed a hostile and haughty air, and with the fragment of a short hunting spear which he carried, and upon which he slightly leaned as he walked, he menaced them. `Stand back, dogs of Christians!' he cried haughtily. `Hear that my son!' said the old hermit, with a flashing eye. `I hear it father,' answered the mountaineer, clenching his hand impulsively; `but we must submit! I would gladly lay down my poor life that such words might no more be heard on the air of Spain. The time may come father!— These Moors be but men!' `They called my master Beelzebub.— His followers must not be startled to be called dogs!' `Pass, Moor!' said the young man in a tone of stern defiance.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER II. THE YOUTHFUL MOOR. The youthful Infidel, for he had not seen more than twenty summers, strode on with his broken spear advanced, as if he anticipated an attack from the mountaineer; for in those hostile times every man was likely to meet a foe in every stranger whose path he crossed. He came along the path until he stood before them. The platform of rock was so narrow, that the hermit and the gazelle-tender fully occupied it; yet the descent of the path lay over it, to which it formed a sort of step. The hermit stood firm; but the mountaineer by his side gave way as far as he might with safety, to let the young Moorish huntsman pass between them. He hesitated, nevertheless, to go by. The stern glance of thu hermit rested upon him as he remained as immovable as a statue. `Wilt thou let me pass, Christian dog?' repeated the Moor with flashing eyes, as he pressed his spear point towards the silvery beard of the venerable apostle of the Cross. `The Christian hath turned aside full often for the Infidel, young man.' `I cannot pass unless thou move also,' answered the Moor. `I am wounded by the tusk of a boar which I slew but a few paces up the defile, and I hasten to my friends. Let me pass.' `There is fresh blood discoloring his kaftan, father,' said the mountaineer.— `He speaks the truth.' `I am deeply hurt in the side. Give way and let me hasten, or thou shalt rue it. My life or thine.' `Nay, if thou art in suffering I will not stay thee, but rather aid thee, Infidel,' answered the hermit, his brow relaxing its sternness of aspect, and his countenance beaming with benevolence and sympathy. Sit here and let me see thy wound and I will bind it up for thee.' The young man gazed keenly upon his features with looks of mingled doubt and confidence. The latter feeling prevailed, perhaps aided by his consciousness of his inability to advance forward without some aid; for he was growing fainter each moment from the loss of blood which was now seen trickling upon his sandalled feet. `I will trust thee, Christian,' he answered faintly, as he sat, or rather sank down upon the rock at their feet; his spear fell from his relaxed grasp; a deadly paleness took the place of the flushed brow; and, inclining his head upon his shoulder, he became insensible in the arms of the young gazelle-keeper. `He has now beceme a subject for Christian love and pity, rather than Christian anger,' said the recluse. Poor youth, though an Infidel, he is a child of Adam, even as we are, and we cannot refuse him our aid in extremity. Loosen the shawl, Alfonzo. Carefully, for the wound may be deep, and the blood should not come too freely.' The young mountaineer had stood aside, as we have seen, at the imperious and insulting demand of the Moor, to give him room to pass; for, though he loved not the Infidel, he regarded him as it were a guest upon his mountains, and he did not care to be so uncharitable as to deny him the pathway, open to all. He had stood aside, too, at imminent peril, for the rock below him fell sheer a hundred feet, and he had only his firmness of foot and steadiness of nerve to sustain him while the Moor should pass him. In stepping aside, therefore, he trusted to the Moor's honor not to jostle him; for the slightest touch would have sent him headlong. In a word, he had jeopardised his own life out of a spirit of mountain courtesy to the Infidel. It was not a feeling of fear that caused him to obey. The heart of the young gazelle-tender knew nothing of the sensation before man. The stern Christian indignation of the bearded hermit, however, would not suffer him to yield to a demand made so haughtily and with such epithets. He stood his ground, and would have grappled with the Moor ere he would have recognized the degrading appellation applied to him by obeying. But when he saw the young Moslem bleeding before him, and beheld him sink insensible at his feet, all his humanity dissolved into gentle charity for the sufferer; and, forgetting the Mahommedan in the man, he extended to him prompt assistance. From his girdle he untied a thick leather pouch, which he hastily opened, and out of it took two little crystal vials and a box of some fragrant unction, which he proceeded to mingle together and pour upon linen torn from the bosom of the Moor. By the time he had prepared this, Alfonzo had removed the shawl and firmly woven garments and laid bare the wound, which was an unsightly rent in the side between the ribs. In a few moments, by the application of the linen saturated with the medical preperation the flow of the blood ceased.— The wound was then carefully dressed and bound up by the hermit with a degree of skill found at this time only in the art of the surgoon. `Now, my son, canst thou bear him on thy shoulders to thy hut in the hamlet!' asked the hermit as he completed his Samaritan-like task. `We have done our duty to this Infidel, as unto God, and we must not let him lie here and die.— We must watch over him till he can take his feet again!' `I can carry him, father!' answered Alfonzo as he raised the lifeless form of the stranger upon his shoulder and proceeded carefully to descend the steep way, the hermit following supporting his steps by the aid of the boar-spear which he had brought from the shelf of rock to return to the Moor when he should recover. In a few minutes, this latter portion of the mountain path being easier of descent than the former, they reached the foot of the mountain and entered all at once upon a kind of village thoroughfare that led beneath shady trees, along the rocky borders of the brook and lined on one side with the rude huts of the mountains. Although this hamlet seemed to be, when viewed from Paul's Rock, in the level of the valley, it was at least seventy feet above it, and the brook of the defile along which it was built, gained the vale only by a succession of wild cataracts, whose roar echoing from the cliff and mountain sides, was heard unceasingly. It was a rude, romantic spot where the hamlet stood, and being so high on the road of the valley and so profoundly concealed by trees that it was visible only to those who from the cliff above could look directly down on its thatched roofs and hugely constructed chimneys. Alfonzo bore the burden on his shoulder along the street of the hamlet, until he came to a hut constructed of stone a little apart from the rest of the habitations. It was sheltered by half a dozen date and banana trees, and a majestic cork tree grew before its door. Under the cork-tree sat a man about forty years of age making a frugal meal of coarse barley bread and dried fish. He wore the dark brown shepherd's rernagan and broad palm hat, and at his feet crouched a shaggy wolf dog, who upon seeing the approach of Alfonzo and the recluse, glared hls white teeth and emitted a savage growl. `Who is it, Lopo?' questioned the man as he looked through the dim twilight in the direction of the approaching party.— `Ah, it is the good father, Godefred, and Por Dios! here comes Alfonzo with a dead man on his shoulder!' With these words the goatherd laid his bread and fish down on the root of the tree upon which he had been seated, and hastened to meet them. `What is this? Who have you here? An Infidel? We have one less enemy in the land.' `He is not dead father Gaspar,' answered Alfonzo, as he laid his burden at the foot of the tree. `Not dead! Then by the mass let us kill him ere he get to his feet again!'— cried the goat herd drawing from his girdle the broad sharp knife that he had used in many a combat with the wolves of the Sierras in defence of his goats. `Nay, Gaspar,' cried father Godfrey, arresting his hand as he aimed a blow at the breast of the lifeless Moor with as little compunction as if the infidel had been a wild beast. `The Moslem is thy guest? You must not harm him. God hath given him to our charity, and we must not show ourselves worse than barbarians by slaying a helpless foe. We found him on the hill at the cross path, he was grievously wounded in combat with a boar and sank at our feet lifeless; albeit if he had had strength he would not have hesitated to have made his way over our bodies. But when he could no longer do us harm and lay at our feet dying, christian feeling commanded us to bind up his wounds and restore him to life.' `To kill thee afterwards,' growled the dark-faced goatherd slowly and reluctantly returning his knife to its sheath of untanned leather. `Nay, he will never injure a benefactor, Infidel though he be. The sons of Islam regard hospitality as a sacred duty. So must we Christians. How know you but that we may convert him to the faith of the cross when he shall recover? Hast thou a spare couch? `He shall have mine, father!' answered Alfonzo. `That is noble in thee, son. I am glad to see that thy soul is so superior as to not only disdain taking advantage of a fallen foe, but to put thyseif to iuconvenience to entertain him. Gaspar, I see discontent on thy brow still. Thou may'st go into the valley and slay as many Moors as thou wilt, but thou canst not lay thy hand upon the man whom God hath smitten, without sin. Alfonzo bear him into the hut and let him sleep. As he awakes give him this potion dissolved in a glass of water from the brook. It will restore his strength, and at the end of three days he will be able to rejoin his friends in Cordova for by his white hands and his rich costume he is of high lineage among the Moslems.' `And whither go you, father?' asked Gaspar. `By the mass, I shall not sleep a wink to night with a Mahmoud under my roof. Make the sign of the cross on my door-stone ere thou depart.' `I am glad to see thy faith in the cross my son. It will protect thee and all who believe in it, both in this world and the next, and against infidel and Satan. I will do as thou sayest.' With these words the venerable apostle knelt upon the threshold after Alfonzo had again lifted the body and bore in into the hut, and reverently made the sign of the cross not only upon the door-stone, but also upon the lintel and sides of the door. The mind of Gaspar seemed from his countenance to be greatly relieved by this strong defence against Moorish necromancy; should their guest attempt to exercise any of the supernatural evil power attributed to the Saracen. Father Godfrey now approached the rude couch of dried mountain grass, upon which Alfonzo had gently laid the Moor, and by the pleasing light of a torch of resin-wood gazed for a moment upon his pale and strikingly beautiful features. `Poor youth; with so fair a body, and so dark a soul: alas, that it should be lost forever, when Christ hath died for him as well as for thee and me, Gaspar. When I return to the hamlet, which I shall do to-morrow morning early, I will call and see how he fares. If he wake up before dawn, Alfonzo, speak to him kindly; and let him not rise till I come. Now good night, and God's benison be on thee and thy house. Father, I will go with thee,' said Alfonzo, following him out of the hut, and laying his grasp upon his robe. `No, son; I need no aid now. The way is familiar to my feet and my staff, by night as well as by day. Watch you by the side of the infidel. Thy conduct this night has made me love thee, Alfonzo. I have often looked upon thee with interest as I have seen thee watching thy gazelles upon the cliffs, and thanked the blessed Virgin that thou wert a son of the church. Thou hast shown true Christian charity to-night. I know thy hatred of the Moslem power, my son, and thy scorn of the infidel name; and, know therefore, that to extend this kindness to one of the foes of thy church and land, was a great sacrifice of thy fiery spirit. Good night, son. I go on a mission that requires secrecy and needs no companionship, else I would take thee with me. Watch well over thy guest.' With these words the hermit walked forward, and soon Alfonzo saw his white locks disappear over the verge of the path that led down into the valley. Slowly he returned to his hut, and entering it approached the Moor, who seemed to sleep heavily, and seating himself by his couch, began to examine with a curious eye the jewels with which he was adorned.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER III. THE SPANISH TOWER. While Alfonzo was admiring the richness of the apparel, and the wondrous beauty of the jewels which adorned the wounded Infidel, Gaspar, his father, sat on the opposite couch gazing moodily and silently upon the pale face of their unconscious guest. At length he spoke, as he saw Alfonzo examine with attention a jeweled bracelet that clasped the left wrist of the Infidel: `This tinsel we have to pay for, boy. That red ruby is made of the best blood of Spain. That diamond is made of the congealed tears of the daughters of the land who fill the Infidel's bosom. These silken vestments are woven from the heart's fibres of the best men in Spain. What the man has on is not his, but thine and mine. This was said sternly, and with a countenance darkly foreboding the purpose that the goatherd was forming in his soul. Alfonzo fixed upon him a keen glance. He read his father's thoughts and feelings, for his own bosom sympathized in them. He felt that his words were true words; that the glory of the Moslem was the degradation of Spain. But he could not enter into his father's stern resolve to desecrate the hospitality of the roof beneath which, in his arms, he had brought the youthful Saracen, at the command of the holy hermit. `Father, you say what no man in Spain can gainsay. But this is no time to talk of such things. This Infidel and all he possesses is sacred. `Alfonzo, I am a poor goatherd. I live on coarse fare, I wear coarse garments; and this poor cabin is my only home. But before the Moor came my father was a noble, of proud Gothic and Roman lineage. He fared sumptuously, he wore purple and dwelt in a palace. All this before the Moor came. I am made poor through the Infidel. My father's palace in Cordova is now the Seraglio of a turbaned Emir. My father's head fell beneath the scymetar of the conqueror Taric. I alone live an exile in the Sierras, remembering the past greatness and present ignominy of my house and name. And this man who lies here, and his, did it.' `He is not twenty yet, father, and it is twenty years since Taric at the battle of Xeres overthrew the Christian power and made Cordova the Saracen capital. At least this young man is innocent.' `Art thou a Moor, that thou should'st speak one word in behalf of one of them?' cried Gaspar, with angry vehemence. `If he was not one of the conquerors of the land he is one of its dwellers and one of our masters. At this moment thou seest that he has upon his person wealth for a noble. It is not his. The Moors brought nothing into Spain but their scymetars. Yet they have cities and morgues, and slaves, and gold and silver, and wear silks and jewels, and the Moslem court of Cordova outvies in regal splendour the court of the Gaul or the Roman Emperor! All this magnificence hath been coined out of Spanish hearts. I say this Moor's jewels are mine. I will tear them from him, boy, and send him forth to get more as he got these, by robbing and rapine. I will be a goat-herd no longer and crouch here in fear to show my head in the valley for fear of a Saracen scymetar. I will go to Vence or Rome and live their like a noble as my fathers were.' `The good father Godfrey hath given him to me and thee in sacred charge. I would not touch a hair of his head. Nor, father, shall you so wrong yourself as to harm him!' `Dost thou menace me?' cried Gaspar, laying his hand upon the haft of his knife. `No, father. But I would not have it said in the hamlet by our neighbours that the hermit Godfrey brought a wounded Moor to thy roof and bade thee take charge of him till he got well, and that thou did'st basely rob him. The honest goatherds would cry `shame!' `With this Moor's gold and jewels I should ere many days be beyond the voices of my neighbours and indifferent to their scorn. Say no more, boy; I will take his jewels from him ere he wakes to defend them.' `Yes, father, that is right. Go to it like a coward, as becomes the deed you would do. Be careful that he wakes not to scare thee away. I did not believe the best of gold would have made thee forget thy honesty as a man, and thy honour as a Spaniard, to say nothing of thy duty as a host.' `Do you mock me? I swear to thee, boy, that I will not let this Moor go forth as rich as he came. It is a merit to rob an infidel. It is not robbery, but taking back that which is our own.' `Hear me, father,' said Alfonzo, who saw him stretch forth his hand rudely to unclasp the dazzling bracelet from his arm. `You are a brave man. You have slain in deadliest struggle three score and ten wolves, as the notches on thy boar-spear show to all who will count them. Now wouldst thou by one act of robbery, the robbery of a wounded and sleeping foe, undo all thou hast done, and proclaim thyself a coward.' `I am no coward, boy.' `Then show it by waiting till the Infidel is restored by father Godfrey's potions to strength and health. Then, ere he departs, tell him what thou wert tempted to do while he lay asleep in thy power, and say that you will now give him a chance to defend his property, for you mean to try and win it of him in fair battle as becomes a brave man.' `I will do it; by the mass. I will wait, boy,' responded the stout goatherd, drawing back his hand from the tempting bracelet. I would rather have them that way, than meanly to rob him. Thank thee, boy, for this hint. His jewels are mine as certainly as if I took them now; for he must needs he a strong man who can defeat Gaspar, the wolf-killer.' And as he thus spoke he elevated his broad, herculean chest and gazed with complacency upon his sinewy bare arms as he moved them up and down with athletic pride in their muscular power. Alfonzo looked gratified that he had succeeded by his knowledge of his father's character, in saving the sleeping Moor from being plundered in their hut. There was in the spirit of Alfonzo a vein of chivalric feeling that elevated him far above his condition; and though he loved not the tyrant and oppressor of the land, he could be generous and superior to hostility or revenge in circumstances which appealed like the present, to the loftier sentiments of his breast. It was with pleasure he saw the change in the manner of Gaspar, who putting up his formidable knife, looked once more upon his guest, not with plans of robbery, but with impatient wishes for his speedy recovery. Alfonzo saw that the Moor had nothing more to fear at present from his father, and rising, he said, `I will be in by and by and watch with him, till dawn. I leave you, father, to sit up with him till I come back.' `I will do it. You need not fear me, Alfonzo. I am as sure of him when he gets well, as I should be now. Where do you go?' `Not far. I will be back in two hours. If he wakes, administer what I have mixed in the cup!' `I will do just as you say. I hope it is a magic drink that will put him on his feet in five minutes after as well as ever. By the mass it would not be many seconds before we should be at it, Christian to Moor.' Alfonzo threw on his bernish, a coarse brown mantle, like a blanket, about his manly form, and gathering it about his waist with a wide belt, to which hung a wolf's sheathe knife, took his mountain staff and went out. The night was gloriously bright, with burning stars in the deep azure of heaven, rivaling the lustre of the pure moon, which floated like a transparent shell upon a blue sea. The low winds breathed gently among the lime and the date trees, and rustled pleasantly in the pendant foliage of the banana. The mountain crests rose skyward on either hand, as if supporting a group of the fleece-like clouds that hung above them and almost seemed reposing upon them.— The roar of the sparkling brook at his feet filled the defile with a constant song that the mountains loved always to hear. The young gazelle-tender walked along the narrow road that led past the few huts that composed the secluded hamlet, and coming to the descent along the side of the water-falls, bounded down the declivity almost with the speed of the leaping cataracts that shone in the moonbeams like ribbons of silver unrolled down the dark face of tho cliff. He was now upon the plain in a grove of cork-trees whose heavy shadows left the path-way which wound beneath their huge trunks, in impenetrable darkness. But, at intervals, glimpses of moonlight falling upon the sward through an open space between the branches, lighted him along like beacons gleaming in the deep forest gloom. He pursued his way, not in the direction of the city of Cordova, but following the base of the Sierra, which constantly frowned above his path. At length, after going about a mile, he came suddenly upon a spur of the mountain, and passing round it, he entered a gorge similar to that in which the hamlet stood. He ascended a few rods a grassy but steep path, when getting above the top of the forest trees which he had hitherto been traversing, and which spread before him like a dark green lake slightly agitated by the breeze, he looked up and rested his eyes for an instant upon a tower a few feet above him and overhanging the path. It was a square bastion, with a round turret or tower at the outer angle, and standing on the very verge of the mountain, and at the edge of the defile, like a sentry to protect its passes. It was, however, in ruins, like nearly every strong hold which had once belonged to the Christian inhabitants of the fair valley of Andalusia; for that it was a Spanish, and not a Moorish fortress, was plain from its age and peculiar construction. The tower had lost a portion of its battlement, and the bastion had been deprived of several feet of its wall at the southern angle. Over it towered two lofty sycamores, like protecting genii. The moonlight fell upon it and exposed both its strength and state of ruin. `So has the curse of the infidel blighted all that is fair in Spain,' said Alfonzo, as he let his eyes linger upon it as it towered over the forest, and looked yet like a strong hold of power even in its impotency. All about the tower was silent and peaceful. The thunder of battle that had once rolled round its base was hushed! The cry of the warrior, the shriek of the fallen, the clangour of steel meeting steel, the roar of warlike engines were silenced. Repose and loneliness and peace seemed to have made it their home. Alfozo, reflecting in this strain, began to ascend a flight of hewn steps that led to the portal of the tower. He passed around the angle of the ruined bastion, and came all at once upon a neat whitewashed kasah, or vine-dresser's cottage, sheltered by the wall of the tower on one side, and by the face of the cliff on the other. It was before its door that the two sycamores grew. The moonlight fell full and pleasantly upon the small green plat adorned with roses and blossoming flowers, before the door, and revealed a spot of loveliness rarely found in such a remote and secluded region. The cottage or casah was built of stone from the bastion, in a neat manner, was flat-roofed, and its spotless white walls were only seen through the interstices of vines that clambered all over it, so profusely that it resembled a bower. Before the door was a bench, and under each of the two windows was a bench, on which humble vases of flowers were placed, half veiling the casement. The little space between the door and the wall was about forty feet wide, green as soft verdure could make it, and containing little plots of mountain plants and the two gigantic sycamores. Back of the cottage rose sublimely into the starry heavens the wooded face of the Sierra. To the south, through an opening between the mountain and the bastion, was a glimpse over forest, garden, plain, and fertile meadow, of the white minarets of Cordova, beyond which remoter far, against the margin, like blue-tinted shadows, the faintly-seen masses of the Sierra Nevada. Alfonzo lingered an instant as he came upon this little paradise, as if fearing to disturb its peaceful beauty by his presence. He then, with his finger on his lip, walked softly forward, and was about to approach the window nearest to him, when a huge dog bounded from the shadow of the building, and without a voice, other than a low, fierce growl, leaped towards him, as if he would rend him. But, ere he made the second bound, he crouched at his feet and whined recognition. Alfonzo patted the shaggy beast upon his head and then tap ped at the window, by the side of which hung, like trophies, rather than for present use, an old shield and two or three sheathed yatagans, belonging to the owner of the cottage. He tapped a second time, and then, putting aside the trellis, looked in. The moon-beams that he admitted showed a small neat chamber, with a spotless couch, but no occupant. Voices fell upon his ear from an inner room. He was about to leave the window to enter by the door, when a hand was lightly laid upon his shoulder, and a musical voice pronounced gladly, but in a low tone, his name.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER IV. THE INFIDEL MAIDEN. The young mountaineer turned quickly round, and, with an exclamation of delight, clasped to his heart a lovely maiden of a beautiful form and an air of wild mountain grace, mingled with a modesty so captivating, a bearing so proud and free, that she seemed a fit mate for the noble, manly gazelle-keeper, who was gazing so affectionately into her dark moon-lit eyes. Such eyes ne'er had gazelle as hers. So large, and bright, and starry, and so beaming with love and the tenderness of passion. `Genilla,' he said, `I feared you were away again. I was just about entering the door to seek you.' `Allah be praised that you did not!' she answered fervently. I am so glad you are come. It is three days—three long days, Alfonzo since I have seen you.' `I have seen you every moment, dearest Genilla. I have to look into my heart to find your image there always.' `And do you think I forget you? How is it you have not been here?' `I have had much trouble with my gazelles of late. They have four times, in the last three days, wandered far out of their usual track upon the mountains, and I have spent many hours in search of them. The night before last I was upon the mountain till dawn.' `How I tremble when I reflect upon your dangers at such times, dear Alfonzo,' said the dark-eyed girl, looking up into the face of her lover with beaming eyes that seemed moistened with tears of affectionate solicitude. `One false step in those hours of darkness, and you would perish! Would that you could turn to some other pursuit, my noble Alfonzo. Oh, that you would listen and be persuaded to—' `Not a word more, Genilla,' he said playfully, yet firmly; `I know what you would say. I am a Christian and not a Moor!' `You should, for my sake, seek the service of the Emir,' she continued warmly. `If thon lovest me, Alfonzo, thou canst not hate my people!' `For thy sake, I would do them good and not evil. For thy sake I have done them kindness, when it was in my power to injure them. But more than this, I cannot. I would rather be the free gazelle-keeper upon the mountains, exposed to death by the precipices and the wolves, rather than take service with the chiefs of thy race. Speak no more to me upon this subject, Genilla!' The maiden folded her fair hands upon her bosom, and sighed and remained silent. Alfonzo led her gently along a narrow walk, bordered with wild flowers, which wound round the cottage, and thence held its serpentine way up the mountain. They walked on a little way together, until they came to a smooth rock, hollowed out beneath a trickling mountain stream, that had filled the cavity. A few gold and silver fishes glanced about in the pool, their glittering scales reflecting the moonlight, as it found its way to them through the foliage of an acacia that grew from a crevice in the rock, and bent gracefully over it. There was a stone bench against the natural wall by the fountain, and a bed of moss before it for the feet to rest upon. `Let us sit here, Genilla,' said Alfonso, as he drew her gently to the seat. `How delicately the distant minarets sparkle in the beams of the young moon, which looks upon a hundred rivals in Cordova! Would it were the cross the moon shone upon. Father Godfrey says that he remembers when a hundred golden crosses caught, and flung back the glory of the morning sun. Would those good days were come again, Genilla. But I see that you like not the subject. I know, if I love thee, I must love thee as thou art; but would to God thou wert a Christian!' `Would to Allah thou wert a true believer, Alfonzo!' said the maiden, earnestly, her dark eyes lighting up with beautiful enthusiasm. `We will not talk of this now. Who was with thy father when I tapped at thy window, and where were you, Genilla, when I came?' `I was in the tower looking for thee, and listening for thy step. I expected thee to-night, for if thou hadst not come I should have been sad and filled with fears of thy safety. I saw thee come up the path and listen at the lattice. I came out of the tower and touched thee just in time to keep thee from entering rashly.' `Who is with thy father?' `The Chistian hermit.' `Not father Godfrey!' exclaimed Alfonzo, with amazement. `Yes. He came about a quarter of an hour ago. I was in my lattice singing to my littah when I beheld his tall, majestic figure crossing the green to the door. I trembled, I hardly knew why; but since he used to come and talk to me of Christ, I have feared him. Yet I would have warned him, for thy sake, that my father, Ben Osmin, was at home. I ran forth for this purpose, supposing he had come as heretofore to persuade me to become a Christian, to tell him his danger, when seeing me he directly asked for Ben Osmin.' `Asked for the stern Moor?' `Yes. He said to me, Daughter, I would see thy father. Lead me to him!' `And you obeyed?' `While he was speaking, Wolf, the dog, was making a deep growling noise which brought my father to the door. Upon seeing him I expected I knew not what scene of horror, for my father loves not a Christian. But upon seeing the hermit, for the moon showed him plainly to him, he advanced with courtesy and taking bis hand, said, `Enter, Christian in the name of Allah.' `This is surprising. It was hither then that the father was coming.' `He seemed to be expected. My father led him into the house, and at the same time bade me walk awhile in the moon-light as he had a private talk to hold with the hermit. So I wandered into the tower and stood in the window waiting for you and wondering at this strange visit of the hermit to my father.' `It is strange indeed. I know not what it can mean. He cannot hope to convert Ben Osmin. Yet he and Ben Osmin can have no business together in common. It is very strange that the holy father should leave his mountain lodge at night to come hither.' `Perhaps they have business together. In Cordova Christian and Infidel traffic together, jostle each other in the Bazaars, and dwell at peace within the same walls. Why should not two meet here? Are not you and I proof that they may, Alfonzo?' she asked, smilingly. `But I have not inquired of thee how that fair mountain maid, thy sister, is?' `Xariffa is well, and each day wishes thou wert a Christian.' `Then she knows her brother loves the daughter of the Moor?' `I have told her.' `And did not her dark eyes flash with anger, Alfonzo.' `Oh, no; she said that she hoped I should be the instrument in leading you to the truth. Twice only have you met each other, but often enough, I know, to be mutually interested in one another. `She is very beautiful! I love her because she is so like you I saw in her eyes and in her smile the smile and eyes I love.' `The consciousness that I am beloved by you, Genilla, is bliss to me. I dwell upon your sweet image when I am alone upon the mountain, I dream of you in the night. The stars remind me of the light of your eyes, the singing of the birds of your voice. Were it not for you —for my love for you—' `Well, Alfonzo, why do you place your face between your hands and heave a sigh so sad?' `I cannot breathe the words that came to my lips. It may not be. Yet I do not fear to trust you.' `Fear to trust me, Alfonzo?' she said with accents of touching reproach. Fear Genilla! I thought our hearts, our hopes, our lives, were one.' `No, I do not fear to trust you, dearest girl, though our faiths differ, our hearts beat as one heart in one bosom. You shall hear all I would have said. But for my love for thee, instead of serving the Moor in the Emir's guard as thou wouldst have me, I would take up arms against him were there a Chief to be found in Spain. `These words from thee! This spirit in the bosom that Genilla believed throbbed only for himself! wouldst thou indeed arm this hand which now holds mine in its bound grasp with the steel of war to pierce the heart of my father, of my countryman!' `Do not take my words with such spirit, Genilla! There is no need! God knows we have no leader in Spain. The land is sunk in bondage to the Moor.— The scymetar has struck down the cross; the Mosque has displaced the cathedral! The Priests of God are flown into Italy or have perished by the sword, or live exiled in the mountains like the holy father Godfrey himself, once the Abbot of the richest monastery in Spain. Chiefs we have none. Our nobles are out-laws; our Princes have perished. The Moor reigns in the palace of Amalarie and the Convent of the Blessed Virgins has become a harem for Algezir the Eimr. Thou mayest, therefore, laugh, but not be angry at my words; for they are only words. They will never be more than words!' `Alfonzo, I will neither laugh nor be angry. It is natural that you should feel as you do, being a Spaniard and a Christian. But look! behold the cloud of glittering crescents that shines above the walls of Cordova! These should show you that the power of the Prophet is established in the land and that the followers of the Nazarene have no more hope! You should therefore cease to dwell upon your past greatness as a nation and submit to the rules of my people. It cannot be remedied.— The destiny of your race is sealed.— The Prophet is fated to hold empire here forever. Be wise, then, cling no longer to a crushed and fallen faith, and embrace that of the true Apostle of God!' `I know there is no hope, at least I see none, Genilla! But I can never rest quietly under the yoke of Islam. I can never become a follower of the False Prophet!' `Be it so. So that we love let there be peace between us!' said the maiden laying her hand upon his shoulder and looking up affectionately into his serious face. `This is heavy conversation for us, Alfonzo. Let me sing to thee! You are gloomy and I will sing thee a lively ballad. It shall be of the fortunes of an Andalusian maiden who was taken captive by Taric the Conqueror!' `No, I care not to listen now to songs of Moorish valor, Genilla. I am interested to know what can be the subject of the interview between the father Godfrey and Ben Osmin.' `When he has gone, my father, who keeps no secrets from me, will tell me, then shalt thou know! Did you see ought of a hunting party from Cordova, on the mountains to-day?' `Did one pass here?' asked Alfonso quickly. `Through the defile below, within a quarter of a mile. But they were half concealed by the trees, yet I could see it was a brave show of arms and horses, banners and silks, with lively bugling. `How large a party?' `No less than three score. It was an Emir at the very least. No doubt they went into the mountain to hunt wolves.' `If they were keepers of goats on the Sicrras, they would see little pastime in hunting the wolf. When did you say they went by?' `About an hour after the sun was up.' `Then none of them have come back that you have seen?' `No; doubtless they have issued by yon defile and returned to the city.' `I heard hunters on the hills to the southward of me during the day, and about noon a wounded wolf dashed howling past me as I was dining from my wallet a thousand feet up the mountain. I have yet more to tell thee. As I was coming down the Sierra path with father Godfrey, a youthful Moor, richly attired and armed with a shattered boar-spear, came into the path; and, the way being narrow, and we being in it resting, he sternly bade us stand aside, and suffer him to precede us down the mountain!' `And what did you?' she asked earnestly. `I thought of you and stood aside.— But the holy hermit remained firm. The Moor advanced upon him as if to run him through, and I had raised my hand to catch the spear when the young infidel sunk upon his knees and fell over lifeless and bleeding!' `A miracle performed by the hermit!' she cried between scorn and surprise. `No; he had been a short time before wounded by a boar's tusk, and was hastening from the mountains when he met us. But his strength failed him and he fell senseless at our feet.'</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER V. THE EMIRS. The young Moorish girl, upon hearing the account given thus by her lover, prepared her mind to hear of the death of the Saracen hunter by his hand. He saw by the expression of her countenance that she expected him to announce this to her. He quietly answered her suspicions by a smile ere he said: `And doubtless you believe that I left him there to die, Genilla, or that I hastened his end with my steel's point?' `I know not what you did. I pray you let me know quickly. I would know whether I sit by the side of a murderer of one of my countrymen!' she said haughtily. `I raised him upon my shoulders, after father Godfrey and I had dressed his wounds, and bearing him down the mountain, I placed him on my own couch in my hut. I left him there an hour ago asleep, and under my father's charge. Before I left the hermit took his departure, bidding me take good care of him, and when he awoke administer a cordial which he left. In this way did I avenge my countrymen's wrongs upon thine, Genilla!' `Forgive me, Alfonso.' `Thou hast not offended. It was natural that you should suppose I should hate the Moor; but I thought of thee and treated him as if he had been my brother. Besides, he being wounded, I looked upon him as an object of benevolence rather than of enmity. Beneath my father's roof sleeps in peace the Infidel, who tomorrow, if he were well and strong, would not hesitate to level it to the ground, and give our heads to the scymetar.' `Judge them not so harshly, Alfonso. Thou hast done a noble deed. This shall be remembered by me whenever I hear thee, in thy excited moments, vent thy anger upon my people. Who was this Moor?' `I know him not I have seldom seen, Saracen though he be, a nobler face.' `You said his costume was rich!' `Very; and he wore a prince's ransom in jewels about his person.' `Wore he a green turban?' `Yes.' `He is a descendant of the Prophet. He is one of the sons of the Emir, I doubt not. Did you see a ring on his finger with a green stone in it?' `Yes,' `Did you examine the device?' `A key.' `Then thy guest is a Prince, Alfonzo.' `Sayest thou so!' `These are the insignia of an Emir.' `There are a score of Emirs in the realm of Cordova who since the assassination of Prince Ayub Musa have been aspiring to the Emir's throne. Which can this be?' `I know not. It should be one of the first rank. It was his train who passed this morning to the hunt. And in this way he returns wounded, and the guest of the Christian herdsman Gasper. What can have become of his followers?' `He must, in the ardor of pursuit, have wandered from them. No doubt they are seeking him still on the mountain.' `Yes. Hear that winding bugle. I have heard it twice before, but mistook it for the lowing of kine. They still seek him.' `Genilla, whether the wounded Moor be an Emir or not, I am ignorant. He is a Moor, which is the same to me.— Were he a water-carrier of Cordova, he should be as sacredly my guest. But I do not wish his followors to find him in my cabin. It is a quiet home into which the foot of the Saracen has never yet intruded. So, if to-night those who seek him should pass this way by the tower aud ask for him, let it not be known that you know where he is.' `What shall I answer them?' `Say you have not seen him?' `But they ought to know their Prince is safe, though wounded.' `Send them not to my quiet home to seek him. Father Godfrey says that in three days he will be restored to health. He shall then depart. I will guide him to Cordova in safety. For thy sake he shall go free, were he the Imperial Caliph of Damascus.' `I will obey you, Alfonso.' Thanks. Thou knowest that I have a fair and dearly loved sister. Her beauty in these dangerous times is her greatest snare. Let the eyes of any of these Saracen knights light upon her modest beauty, and the sweet flower of my humble home would be plucked, though I should perish in her defence. Send them not thither, Genilla, if thou lovest me!' `I will not, Alfonzo.' `Thanks. Three days away from Cordova will not be long. I would show him how a Christian peasant can show hospitality to a Moorish prince, if prince he be, as he may be, for he had princely bearing with him.' `None but the descendants of the prophet wear the green turban, and only a Prince of the line, the signet graven with a key, the insignia of the Morisco Empire.' `Be it so. There sounds afar off another bugle. Sound on Infidel; thy leader sleeps soundly and hears thee not.' `Hist. There are footsteps. It is my father and the hermit. See, they walk forth together. They take leave of each other with ceremony, and he departs.' `How strange. May it not be that Ben Osmin is a Christian?' `My father false to his faith,' repeated the maiden, with a haughty air. `Sooner, Alfonzo, wilt thou find Genilla false to thee.' `And yet thou art false to me, sweet Genilla, so long as thou refusest to become a Christian. But hither comes Ben Osmin. Shall I meet him boldly? He knows I love thee.' `And he hath forbidden me on pain of death to hold interview with thee.' `I will defend thee.' `What. Draw thy steel against my father? Retire within the shadow of the rock. You cannot pass him unseen. Wert thou only a Moslem, Alfonzo,' she said, reproachfully, `this secresy need not be. Hide quickly?' Alfonzo drew back half a dozen steps so that the acacia, aided by a projection in the rock, effectually concealed his per son to the eye of a casval observer. The beautiful Moorish girl then advanced to meet her father who was calling her by name. `Ho, Genilla. Where art thou, child? `Here, father.' `Allah be praised,' ejaculated the old man, as he came forward. He was a short fleshy man, in a huge white turban, a black kaftan, and red sash in which was stuck a yataghan. His trowsers were of white linen of the amplest volume about the red slippered feet. Ben Osmin was a Mooor by birth, and had been captain of a galley in the fleet which brought over Taric and his army twenty years before. He gained great fame and some wealth in the taking of Cordova, and settled down to enjoy himself after his wars on land and his perils by flood. He was a person of cheerful temper, and had a rare talent at making the most of the sources of happiness in his way. He was a bachelor, that is, he had no harem, for he had a great horror of a sex that had no souls, and to whom the Prophet denied even a corner in Paradise. But one day, as Ben Osmin sat upon his Divan, thinking of nothing in particular, as was his custom, (for pipe smoking in that early age was unknown,) and sipping sherbert through a silver tube, a slippered Moor in blue caftan and soiled turban came near and said, `Salaam, Ben Osmin. Here is a bale of rich shawls the Mufti hath sent thee for thy valour in the wars in defence of the true faith.' `Allah be praised, and Paradise be to the Mufti and all his generations,' answered Ben Osmin. `Take this gold plece and say the words I have spoken to the Mufti. The slave departed hastily, thrusting the gold piece into his girdle as he went out. Ben Osmin now fixed his eyes upon the bale of shawls with glances of mingled admiration and delight. The size of the bale, the beauty of the covering, the courtesy of the Mufti, and the reflection that his bravery was remembered, made his eyes sparkle, and overflowed his heart with joy and universal benevolence. `Allah be praised.' God is God,' he ejaculated more than seven times, with an interval of at least three minutes between each ejaculation. At length he laid aside his sherbet tube, and clapped his hands thrice. An African slave in white turban and white tunic entered, and bowed reverently before Ben Osmin his master. `Hussan, thou seest that bale of rich shawls! It is a present from the Mufti, the defender of the Faith, to me Ben Osmin in consideration of the skulls of Christians I have cloven through in my days of valour. Unloose the cords. Let me feast my eyes on the gift of the Mufti Allah be praised forever.' The African approached the bale of shawls, and undoing the cords by which it was bound cast them aside, and then unrolled the outer shawl. `Beard of the Prophet! what have we there?' cried the amazed Ben Osmin, as the removal of the shawl revealed a wicker basket open at the top, in which lay fast asleep a sweet little infant about a month old. The slave fell back in amazement, and showed his glittering teeth from ear to ear, while the warlike Moor stroked his beard several times with rapidity and ejaculated, `Allah be praised! Hussuf what seest thou?' `An infant, Effendi!' `By the harem of the Soldan—how is it that my bale of shawls hath turned into the child of a woman! God is good!— What must be, is to be. Allah be praised!' With these exclamations of astonishment, the Moor bade Hussuf to take the babe out of the basket, that he might look at it the closer. `Mishallah!' he cried, `it is fair to look upon, though something small; but please Allah it will grow. What is that in the bottom of the basket?' he cried, pointing to a piece of parchment, on which were traced certain characters in Arabic. `Place it in my hands!' The slave obeyed, and Ben Osmin read as follows: `To the discreet and brave Ben Osmin, health and peace, Greeting:—This gift is sent thee by one who honors thee. Shawls will decay, and time tarnishes their beauty; but a soul is immortal. Let Ben Osmin see that the infant be cared for, for he himself is a child in the hand of Allah, and is daily fed from the stores of his bounty. God is good and Mahomet is his prophet!' `Bismillah!' exclaimed Ben Osmin; `a child is better than a bale of shawls. Hussuf, seek out a nurse forthwith, lest it die on my hands, and I have to answer for its life to Isfrael.' The slave disappeared on his errand, and soon returned with the wife of Aben Hassen, the turban-maker in the next street, who pledged herself to take charge of the infant till it should walk for a gold betsch the month. `Allah be praised!' said Ben Osmin, as the woman departed with the babe and he resumed the silver pipe of his sherbet cup. `A child is better than a bale of shawls. I will call it Genilla, and it shall be a shawl of love to my heart when I get old.' So Ben Osmin named the infant Genilla, which signified a shawl of silk, and every day he walked to Hassan's shop to have a sight of his protege, in which he took increasing interest as it began to advance to take notice of him, and by and bye to amuse him with its smiles and prattle. `Bismallah!' he said one day to Hassan, `here am I a bachelor, and yet I have the prettiest daughter in all Andalusia. Allah be praised!' The infant Genilla grew apace to girlhood, and, when she had reached her twelfth year, gave promise of being the fairest maiden in Cordova. Old Ben Osmin worshipped her with pride and love. But at length the Emir or Imperial Caliph, who held the government under the sceptre of the Caliph of Damascus, the Emperor of all Islam, died. It was necessary to send to Damascus to learn who should be his successor. In the interval, two of the principal Emirs, who had been generals of Taric the Conqueror, aspired to the vice-royalty to govern till the return of the messenger. This aspiration created two parties in the city, and, in a severe battle that took place between them, both were slain.— But, hydra-like, no less than eleven Emirs now raised their standards and asserted their claims to the Caliphate. At this juncture, Suleyman, who reigned in Barbary, interposed and appointed Abury Musa, the nephew of the late Emir, to hold the reins of government. But in a few weeks Musa was assassinated by Algezir, a powerful Emir, and once more Cordova was the scene of civil war between the Moors. At length the new Emir arrived from Damascus, but only to find his throne in the hands of Algezir. He raised the standard of the Prophet against him, and calling on all good Moslems to rally around it, he advanced upon Cordova, and defeating the Emir's forces, eompelled him to fly to the Sierras for safety.— He took refuge in the tower beneath which Ben Osmin now dwelt so peacefully, and, after enduring a long siege, was compelled to yield at discretion. As he was an Emir, and the blood of the Prophet flowed in his veins, his blood was not shed, but he was banished to Africa. The Caliph thus won his throne. Ben Osmin had joined the Caliph, and for his instrumentality in bringing about the capture of the Emir in his tower, he had been rewarded with the tower by the Caliph, and a vineyard adjacent. Hither, therefore, he came to dwell; but, instead of inhabiting the tower, he constructed, with great taste, for the comfort of his foster daughter rather than his own, the cottage adjoining it: and here for four years he had been dwelling in peace, undisturbed by the commotions that from time to time rended the city. For the Caliph had not heen two years on his throne, ere the Emir, Algezir, returned, raised a standard of rebellion, deposed him to be in his turn overthrown by a conspiracy of fourteen Emirs, who, too jealous to concede power to either singly, reigned conjointly, but each watching an opportunity to reign alone.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER VI. THE WOLF-SLAYER. The Moor, Ben Osmin, had remained in quiet at his cottage by the tower during all the warlike excitement in the city; and so that he was undisturbed in the society of Genilla, and in the culture of his acre of vineyard, he was content, and it mattered little to him whether one Emir or twenty held the reigns of government in Cordova. `Allah be praised!' he repeated a second time on beholding his foster daughter approaching him from the fountain behind which Alfonzo had concealed himself. `I was afraid thou hadst wandered away, and, by the beard of the Prophet, the neighborhood is none of the safest for a maiden to trust herself in.— Hearest thou the bugles of the hunters among the hills! I would rather they that blow them would keep there than come nigher my dovecote. There are unruly gallants always to be found in an Emir's hunting train! Hast thou been lonely, child?' he asked, taking her hand and addressing her with great kindness, and a countenance sparkling with the deep affection of his heart. `No, father,' she answered, richly colouring and dropping with slight confusion the lids of her dark Arabian eyes. `I am right glad of it, for I had business that kept me.' `Business, father? What couldst thou have to say to the Christian hermit?' `It is not for thine ears, sweet,' answered Ben Osmin, smlling. `I ne'er heard of a woman that could keep a secret. But one day, perhaps, I may tell thee, but not now.' `I do not like secrets, father.' `Then, Mishillah! thou shalt not be troubled with this.' `I mean I do not like them when I dont't know them.' `Oh, that is it. By the beard of the Prophet! when thou knowest it, a secret it is no longer.' `I will find it out ere long, dear father!' `Dost thou threaten me, pretty one?' `I will ask the hermit Godfrey.' `Thou?' cried Ben Osmin with alarm. `I will go up the mountain to his cave and he will not refuse to tell me,' she said with playful firmness. `Daughter, thou must not go near this Christian monk. Thy words have alarmed me. Go not nigh him. Pass no words with him if he cross thy path, if thou hast reverence or love for me.' `Is it so serious, then?' `It is. He might tell thee what I refuse to tell. It is not good for thee to know it. Besides, what he says may be false. I will yet talk further with him after I have been to Cordova, and then I may tell thee!' `Art thou going to Cordova?' cried the maiden with delight beaming in her beautiful face. `You will take me with you, good dear Ben Osmin!' and as she spoke she entwined her graceful arms about his bearded throat and kissed his smooth well-fed cheek with the most winning temptation. `Do not say no!' `By the turban of the Prophet, what can I say?' responded the Moor in perplexity. `Thou must stay at home. I have business.' `It is so lonely here! I have not seen the city since I was a child.' `You cannot go, child. The city is in sight from the tower. Thou seest it daily.' `But I wish to go there!' `It is a dangerous time to take thee there. Any day a revolution may break out. The Emirs are as jealous of each other as so many wolves watching a goat-pen. I should not be surprised to hear that some one of them had raised the green standard and proclaimed himself Supreme Caliph. It would not be afe for thee there. Besides, I am afraid of the gay Saracen cavaliers and rampant Andalusian knights that might rob me of thee! Praised be Allah! thou art secure here, and no one of them knoweth what a treasure is hid here! Don't ask me, Genilla.' `I am not afraid of the knights and cavaliers, father!' `Bismillah! I would have thee afraid of them. Thou shalt stay here.' `If thou leavest me, father, I will go up the mountain while thou art gone, and see the Christian Monk.' `The Prophet knew what he was about when he shut Paradise against women! Elbilirah! Thou shalt go with me.— Allah be praised that is settled!' `I am so delighted! I shall now see the beautiful city, the splendid mosques, the palaces, the knights and cavaliers, the princes' and ladies. Oh, dear Ben Osmin, how very happy I shall be. You are so good.' `On my soul be it! Three women like thee would keep a man from Paradise.' `When do you go, dear father?' asked the gazelle-eyed Genilla, as she hung fondly upon his shoulder. `I must go early in the morning. I will ride on horseback, and thou shalt have the mule accoutred, and amble by my side.' `I shall dream only of Cordova all night, father!' `We must to our beds, if we are to start so early. In the city there still lives old Aben Hassan, the turban-maker, and I will have thee at his house. It is retired and out o' the way o' the range o' the young cavaliers. Come, let us in, daughter!' `I will, father, in a moment,' she answered, slipping back towards the fountain; `I have left my bracelet on the stone bench under the acacia. `How could you drop your bracelet? But get it and come in, for it is a heavy dew.' Genilla did not tell him that her lover had accidentally unclasped it from her wrist, for it would have been to betray his presence which she wished to conceal from him. She saw her father go round the cottage to enter it, and then picking up her bracelet she approached Alfonzo, who came forth from his hiding place, and clasped her hand. `Now you must go without delay, Alfonzo!' she said quickly. `If I linger my father will return, and discover you! To-morrow night I shall be back from the city. I shall then see you and have a great deal to tell you.' `I would rather you would not go to Cordova, dearest Genilla,' said Alfonzo, with a tone of regret at her intention.— `As Ben Osmin says, it is a dangerous place for a maiden, so fair as thou art!' `Jealous already, dear Alfonzo,' said the Moorish beauty, bearing upon him her splendid eyes, while her delicate fingers tapped playfully his cheek.— `Fear me not! I shall fall in love with none of the young Emirs at court. Besides, I am but a poor humble girl, the daughter of a vintner. I fear not that any admiring eye will be turned upon me. I shall be safe in my obscurity, and the humility of Aben Hassan's house.— I only wish to gaze on the magnificence of which I have heard so much, and of which I retain a girlish memory.' `I will say no more lest thou shouldst suppose I fear any knight should look on thee. If I thought thou lovedst me because thou hast seen no other man, I should little prize thy love, Genilla, and might fear it could be turned from me to the first jewelled and gay cavalier that chanced to bend his gaze on the! But I know thee better, and can trust thee even in the gay and free city of Cordova!' `I shall return to value and love thee more. If thou only wert a follower of the true faith,—but I see a frown gathering upon thy brow. We will let faiths alone. We will love for this world alone; faiths belong to a hereafter.' `Not wholly, dear Genilla! But we will not embitter this brief parting moment by a subject on which, I fear, we can never see alike. One day I trust to see thee turn from a religion which denies to woman immortality, and embrace that of the son of Mary, the beloved Virgin mother, through whom all women are blessed and honoured evermore. Good night, love! I will be here again tomorrow night at this hour!' `I will see thee at the fountain!' `Has Ben Osmin spoken about me of late?' But once. When he heard how you had saved three peasants from being torn to pieces by wolves, he said, `He is a brave youth, and were he a good musselman, he would be glad to see thee at the tower. But since he found us conversing together in the path at the foot of the rock, and saw that we liked one another too well, he forbade me to see you, as he forbade you to think of me mere. He is grateful to you for the service you did me, very grateful, but he can never forgive you for being a Christian.' The lovers now parted, and Genilla entered the cottage, casting many a lingering look behind, while Alfonzo, with a thoughtful brow, walked slowly down the tower hill and descended into the forest path, in the gloom of which he was soon threading his way back to the hamlet. We have alluded to a service done by Alfonzo to the Moorish maiden, and which was the foundation of their first acquaintance and of their love. Alfonzo had been brought up in the obscure hamlet of the mountain gorge as a keeper of goats and gazelles; such being the occupation of Gaspar, who having fled to the Sierras from the sword of the Moors, turned himself to this as a means of subsistence. Gaspar was a noble of Spain, a man of uncalculating mind, but of great courage and integrity. He had lost his possession with the rest of his caste, and houseless he fled to the hills with hundreds of his countrymen. Many perished from hunger, many secreted themselves in caves and lived by hunting, more banded themselves as robbers of their conquerors, and lived by rapine; while others joined themselves with the dwellers of the mountains and became herdsmen. Among these was Gaspar, the rough hearted, strong handed noble. He soon became attached to his occupation, for there was a certain excitement in it. Wolves constantly prowled in packs to way-lay and destroy his charge, and the fiercer banded exiles of the hills sallied forth upon his flocks to plunder them for sustenance. In defending his herds against wolves and bandits, he won a name for the prowess that made him respected and feared in all the Sierras.— The fame of Gaspar the Wolf-killer had reached even the streets and marketplaces of Cordova. Trained in such a school, Alfonzo grew up fearless and skilful, and became a conqueror in many a fierce contest upon the monntains with the beasts and robbers that infested it. Side by side with his father, and aided only by a huge wolfdog, he had put to flight and defeated a band of twelve famished robbers who had pounced upon his flock; till at length his herds roamed and browsed with safety upon the loneliest places of the hills, while the flocks of others were daily diminished. At length the mountaineers, unable longer to endure the ravages upon their flocks resolved to band together, and hunt the bandits from their fastnesses in the Sierras. They assembled to the number of four score, each attended by his fierce wolf-dog, a formidable opponent to an armed man. Over this small but resolute force they appointed Gaspar as captain, and Alfonzo as second in command. This was about six months before the opening of our story. The expedition was assembled secretly and went forth secretly. It was successful. The robbers, taken by surprise, were defeated in every encounter. They were driven from their strong holds, and from the Sierras for several leagues space. Alfonzo covered himself with glory by his bravery as well as distinguished himself by his judgment and military skill. Gaspar openly confessed that the whole success of the expedition was owing to the resolution and courage of Alfonzo, an assertion to which all the mountaineers gave their loudest testimony. The young gazelle-keeper received their praises with that modesty which always accompanies true bravery, and from that hour he was the hero of the Sierras; and the fame of Alfonzo the Destroyer, as his enemies, the dispersed bandits, universally denominated him, penetrated the palaces of the Emirs, and his deeds found commendation from the lips of the youthful Moorish cavaliers that hung about the court. Up to this hour Alfonzo had not seen the fair Moorish maiden who dwelt at the white kasah beneath the tower of the rock.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER VII. THE MOORISH SONGSTESS. The young mountaineer, a few weeks after his gallant conquest over the banditti of the hills, was seated upon an elevated peak, watching the browsing goats and bounding gazelles of his flock, dispersed around him and beneath his feet. From the position which he had chosen for the purpose of keeping his charge full in sight, there was a view of the tower and the roof of the cottage of Genilla at the foot of the mountain on the eastern side. He had often gazed down upon this secluded place from the height upon which he now reclined, his dog Ban by his side, his boar-spear lying across his knee, and his eyes sharply wandering over the erratic herd, which he had in keeping, ready to send his watchful dog to bring back any one of the flock that seemed disposed to stray. He had heard that a Moor dwelt in the white walled cot, and this knowledge was sufficient to keep him from ever approaching it, though at times some straggling gazelle would wander down that side of the mountain and draw his steps near the tower in his search after it. Still he never went nigher the dwelling of the Moor than was necessary. He had heard, too, that the Moor who dwelt there had a fair daughter. More than this, he knew not. He had not heard even her name. Perhaps those from whom he heard it, never known it; as there was but little communication between the conquered Christian and the conquering Infidel. It was a sunny afternoon. The bright green undulations of the plain at his feet were relieved by dark lines of forest, or enlivened by the groves and gardens. The air was so transparent that Cordova, though two good leagues distant at the shortest, seeemed as if the hand could be laid upon it. Every object was singularly distinct and beautifully defined in every variation of its out-line. The Guadalquiver, above and below the city, beneath the walls of which it was lost for a while to the eye, shone and flowed brightly on its surface, dotted by caiques decorated, with flags shooting up and down the stream. The villas and terraces, groves and gardens, mosques and minarets, that stood upon its banks were reflected from it as from a mirror. The various winding roads that led across the plain from the mountains or the river gorges, towards the gates of the city, were here and there enlivened by groups of travellers, or now and then a single horseman coursing along like the wind, marking his passage by a long cloud of dust. Near the city glittered the tents of a caravan of merchants about to set out on their journey into Gaul, and winding through the defile came slowly in sight a weary company that had three weeks before crossed the Pyrennees to barter their goods for Moorish gold. A troop of Saracen cavalry were just entering a forest on the right, with sounding bugles and banners flaunting. The young mountaineer's eye wandered listlessly over scenes long familiar to his eye and then let his gaze rest upon the little Morisco cottage a thousand feet below him. His eye was attracted to the appearance of a female figure, which even at that distance, he could discern, was youthful and graceful. It at once occurred to him that it was the Moor's fair daughter of whom he had heard. A little closer scrutiny assured him that she wore the turban and white flowing trousers of the Saracen maiden. He at once became interested in her motions. She was, it seemed to him, engaged in training plants in the little green court-yard. He could see every movement of her white arms, and he felt confident she was gathering flowers. Once or twice she paused and seemed to be looking upward to the mountain, as if she had discovered him perched upon the pinnacle against the blue sky. She then suddenly disappeared. In a few moments a Moor came out and she was by his side. They walked along the terrace and sat down by the fountain. He now knew that he saw the Moor and his daughter. Hark! He bends his ear eagerly and listens. The air is asleep. Not a breath moves that would float a thistle down. Suddenly the notes of music come up the sky, floating on the air like some celestial melody. Far distant and faint as it is, it is inconceivably sweet, and for its very remoteness seems to him to come from heaven. At intervals a richer, clearer, more thrilling note would reach his ear, when his cheek would tingle and his dark, handsome eyes beam and expand with a new delight. The song went on. He could not distinguish a word, for it was doubtless Arabic; but had it been his native Andalusian tongue, the far depth would have rendered words undistinguishable. He could not, moreover, hear only now and then a wild, seraphine strain that made his very heart-strings vibrate with the sweetest sensations. He forgets his gazelles! he forgets where he is! He forgets that the songstress is the daughter of a Moor. He is enchanted, bewildered, and, for the moment, lost! The music ceases. The singer retires, not without looking, as he fancied, up the cliff, and he sees her appear no more, though he watched an hour, hoping to hear once more that voice of passion and melody. At length he rose to his feet, and his cheek burned with shame that he had suffered his heart to be stirred by the scarcely heard song of a Moorish maiden. He felt that he had done a great evil, and yielded to a temptation that his conscience would not acquit him of; for it was no small portion of the Christian faith of that day and nation to hate the Infidel. Hatred of the other was usually a good test of the orthodoxy of either Mahommedan or Christian. Alfonzo felt, therefore, that in suffering his senses to be beguiled for a moment by the syren song of an Infidel maid he had grievously sinned; for he had lively religious scruples, and as become the fashion of the time, so far as belief in the Romish miracles was concerned, was a faithful son of the Church. He had been early initiated into the mysteries of the Christian faith by the hermit Godfrey, who often seeing him when a lad out upon the hills with his gazelles, had taken a deep interest in him, and taken much pains to teach him all that was needful to make a good Catholic of him. As to Gaspar the wolf-slayer, a man was Christian enough for him if he swore by the mass, instead of by the beard of Mahomet. He hardly knew the difference between the religions of True Prophet and the False. He was a Christian simply because he did not happen to be a Moor. He swore by the cross, and had a vague idea that there was some sort of virtue in the cross that would save his soul. But these nicer matters he left to the priests. But Alfonzo was taught by the hermit to understand better the great principles of the Christian faith, and to see clearly that Mahomet was a false teacher, and his followers deluded. He could give a reason, which it would have puzzled Gaspar to do, for accepting the one and rejecting the other. It was not often that his occupation would suffer him to visit the holy hermit in his cell, and there listen to his instructions from the sacred scrolls, and hear the wisdom that flowed from his lips.— But he learned enough to make him an intelligent son of the Cross, to elevate his character and guide his judgment.— His faith became, as it ever does when received in honest trust, the conservator of his principles. A pleasing intercourse thus grew between the young gazelle-keeper and the exiled abbot, and on the side of the latter it manifested itself in parental tenderness, and on the part of the former in gratitude and filial reverence. Not a kid was killed at tfle hamlet that Alfonzo did not bear a portion of it to the cell of the hermit, and he never let escape an opportunity of returning, by attention to his few wants, his sense of the value of his instructions. When now, therefore, our youthful mountaineer began suddenly to feel a consciousness that he had done evil in listening with such pleasure to the voice of the Infidel songstress, he thought of Father Godfrey, and how sternly he would reprove him therefor. It was this reflection that contributed quite as much as his active conscience to deepen the blush on his cheek as he rose to his feet. But, if it were possible to have heightened the glow, it would have been immeasurably increased when, upon looking round him, he saw that nearly every one of his flock had strayed out of sight, not more than three or four being visible, and these at a great distance off, on the side of the mountain above him. His dog, also, seemed to have been charmed with the music, for he lay in a deep slumber at his feet. `How long can this charm have lasted?' he exclaimed, amazed. `It seems but a few minutes, yet my gazelles have had time to stray far away unseen, and the sun is an hour lower in the west. I must do penance when I see the holy hermit for this. I will try to forget that voice so heavenly, if I can! But first, I must hunt up my flock. Ho! Ban! sleepest thou also! Up, and away!— Seek them and bring them back!' The dog sprung from his repose, shook his shaggy hide, and glancing first into his master's face, and then sending his eye over the mountain side, he bounded away, emitting a low growl, as he leaped from crag to crag. The young mountaineer now eager to redeem the time, unslung from his belt a horn, tipped with an agate from the brook, and sounding loud and long for a minute, restored it to its place, and followed his dog with athletic bounds, not even turning his eyes again in the direction of the Moorish cot beneath the tower. It was already on the verge of evening when he found himself with all his flock but one, a favorite gazelle, collected around him at the head of the mountain path, and guarded by his faithful and panting dog. The one astray was his sister's, a fair young girl, whose chief delight it was to contribute to her father and brother's happiness and comfort. She prepared her brother's morning meal at early dawn, of fresh goat's milk, and brown barley bread, and, at evening when he returned, he always found a warm supper awaiting him, with her cheerful smile, and her voice of sisterly affection. The wandering kid was hers. It had, when very young, fallen from a precipice, and broken one of its legs. Alfonzo pitying its sufferings would have killed it; but Xariffa, more merciful still, pleaded for its young life, for it was a very beautiful soft-eyed kind, and seemed to cast its gentle looks up to her as if seeking her protection, and he gave it into her hands. Tenderly and assiduously she nursed it, first skilfully setting the slender bones of its leg, and fostered by her care, it soon recovered health and soundness. From this moment a bond of affection was created between them.— The gazelle bounded to meet her, and licked her hand, and to receive with joyful beaming eyes her fond caresses.— Whensoever she let it accompany her brother to the mountain, for the herbage was sweetest there, she would carefully enjoin him to keep her favorite near him and never let it stray out of his sight. Sacredly had Alfonzo fulfilled the trust until this day. But in the hour he gave himself up to the song of the Moorish maiden, and in watching for her re-appearance, his precious charge strayed with the rest; and when after three hours toilsome exertion and much anxiety he at length got them once more together, lo, the kid, which for his beloved sister's sake, was of more value than all, was missing still! His brow was sad. The solicitude of his bosom was expressed in the sorrow of his countenance. `Poor little Zarif!' he said, looking once more all around, to see if he could not espy its soft bright eyes, peering through the foliage of the mountain heather, or the thickening shades of the rocks. `I fear that thou hast met the fate which thou didst escape in thy infancy! I dare not behold the face of my sister without thee, her loved gazelle. Zarif! Hillo,—o—o, Zarif!' he shouted, till the echoes of the mountains echoed back again `Zarif.' Hast thou seen nothing of the pet kid, Ban? Go, look for her.' The dog understood his master, for the sagacious animal was well aware that one of the flock was missing. Tired as he was he galloped off, and soon disappeared. `If he does not find her, I shall be wretched indeed. This is for listening to the song of a Saracen maid! The holy father hath ever told me that there was necromancy and magic among the Moors, and this comes of it!' The thought of the holy father reminded him that he was near his cell, and, seeing his dog soon return unsuccessful, he resolved, though reluctantly, to turn aside and confess all that he had done, to the hermit.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER VIII. THE WOLF-CHASE. Leaving his faithful dog to guard his herd in the pass, the young mountaineer left the spot where they were collected together, and going a few steps along a ledge in the cliff-side, he came upon an open space, about which grew several clumps of wild olive trees. A group of these concealed the entrance to a cave, which he approached with the ready tread of one familiar with the place. The shadows were already heavy before the opening, and the cave was quite dark. Still he advanced a few steps into it, when he came to an elevated chamber, which received light from an iron lamp, which burned before a curiously-carved altar of stone, supported by sculptured mermaids, upon which stood a crucifix and a cup. The cave was about twenty feet high, as many broad, and twice as many feet in length. It was dry and clean, and hung with two or three pictures of holy scenes in Palestine. The lamp gave a very dim light, and it was a minute before the young man was convinced that the hermit was not in his cave. The pallet of dried wolf-skins, gifts of his own, was empty; and the knee-worn stones before the crucifix were no longer occupied by the holy man of God. The lamp still burning showed that he had been there that day, and his rosary and a scroll, laid down as if hastily left, showed that he had not gone far, for these were articles he never left the mountain without. `I cannot wait for Father Godfrey,' said the young penitent, as he gazed around the dark vault with feelings of religious awe, impressed by a silence that was seldom broken, save by the voice of prayer. `It is near the close of day, and my flock will be belated on the mountain if I linger. But the father hath said prayer and confession ne'er bring evil to any man; so I will fain kneel on this sacred spot and confess to the Virgin my heinous sin. By-and-by I will confess it to Father Godfrey and get absolution. I wish I had ne'er listened to Saracen sorcery.' With these words the young mountaineer reverently laid aside his palm-leaf hat and boar-spear, and even unsheathed and placed beside them upon the ground his hunting-knife; he then placed upon his brow a crown of thorns, the points inward, worn, when at prayer, by the hermit, bowed his head reverently before the little altar, and kissed the crucifix with a penitential air. `Mary mother, Virgin most holy, intercede for an erring son. I have been tempted and have sinned in that I have delighted my ear in the song of the Saracen. It is my fault, my grievous infirmity, and I have seen my guilt in the just dispersion of my flock and the loss of my sister's beloved gazelle. I will offend no more, sweet Mother most holy.' The sincere and ingenuous young Catholic mountaineer then kissed the crucifix again, and then rising to his feet, started with surprise and pleasure, not unmixed with shame; for he beheld standing behind him, in the shadows, the holy father, who carried in his bosom the lost gazelle. His impulse to spring forward and caress the recovered kid was checked by a quick sense of his unworthiness. He therefore fell upon one knee before the hermit, and knowing that he must have been overheard in his confession, he said, `Father, forgive me. Thou hast heard me confess to Heaven.' `Thou hast absolution of thy fault, my son, whatever it may be,' answered Father Godfrey, placing his open hand upon the top of his head. `As I forgive thee on earth, may the Son of the Virgin forgive thee in Heaven. But rise and tell me what thou hast done.' `I have listened with a delight I cannot express to the ravishing sounds of a Moorish maiden, which ascended to my ear from the house of the Infidel by the tower, as I was seated upon the cliff watching my flock. I suffered myself to be so lost by the entrancing sounds, that I forgot I was a keeper of gazelles, nay, forgot I was a Christian, for an Infidel Moor could not have listened with more pleasure than I did.' `Thou hast been in great danger, my son. I trust thou hast not spoken with the Moorish maiden?' `No; I went not nigher than the top of Alfar's cliff.' `Then thou art safe.' `Thou hast not heard all, holy father. I have said I forgot where I was. My herd wandered off and I saw them not. At length I recovered from, or rather broke from the charm, and found my gazelles had strayed I knew not whither. After three tedious hours of anxious search I gathered them again at the head of the path to go down the mountain— every one save Zarif, the favorite of my sister, and which to my great joy and relief I see nestled in the bosom of your robe. Penitent and sorrowing for what I had done, I sought your cave to make confession, when finding you absent I kneeled to confess to the Blessed Virgin and her Babe, which I trust will be as effectual as if I had confessed to you, since you heard me.' `Yes, my son! I am glad to see such ready contrition. That is truest repentance which soonest followest misdoing. I am sorry that thou shouldst have suffered the voice of a Saracen sorceress to have allured thine ear till sin entered thy heart. Thou hast been punished in the dispersion of thy flock, and in the loss of thy kid, and your anxiety for it. I will inflict on thee no other penance. The maiden whom thou listenedst to is the daughter of the Moor, Ben Osmin, a stern hater of the Christian. Here is thy gazelle, my son.' `Where didst thou find my little kid, holy father?' asked Alfonzo, as he received the beautiful animal from the arms of the hermit, and pressed it to his own bosom with grateful joy. `I knew not that I should ever see it again—and how should I have met my sister?' `I heard the sound of thy horn calling together thy kids, and at the same time the bleating of two or three before the mouth of the cave. I rose and went forth, wondering much at seeing them there, when, from the direction in which I heard your horn, I knew you were half a mile from them to the Eastward. It surprised me, as you are always found within sight of your flock. Something, thought I, unusual has happened; and I proceeded to drive your goats towards you. In a little while your noble dog passed me, guiding seven or eight more, and then I saw that all your flock had been dispersed over the hills. I was about to return towards the cave, seeking any others that might have got lost to turn them towards you, when I heard a faint cry.' `It was my poor gazelle!' `It was. It was some time before I could ascertain whence it proceeded; at length, after considerable search, I saw it lying at the foot of a precipice down which it had fallen!' `My unfortunate gazelle! this was owing to my folly.' `I saw that it was in danger of being destroyed by a young eagle that was every few seconds wheeling around it and then swooping towards it with grasping talons, but scared away, yet each instant growing bolder by the loud outcries of the affrighted kid!' `I shall never forgive myself, father.' `It was a long distance round the cliff, but I succeeded at length in descending safely to the spot where it lay; and scaring away the fierce bird, I rescued it from its perilous situation. I found no limbs broken, but that it had been only bewildered by the fall.' `It looks likely again;—my poor Zarif!' `It is unharmed.' `Thanks to the Blessed Virgin!' `No doubt that this happiness is vouchsafed to you in reward for your contrition. I trust you will never offend in this way again.' `There must have been sorcery in her voice or the words she sang, father. It strangely affected me. It was a sensation wild and delightful! a sort of sweet intoxication of the senses! I have no doubt that it was magic.' `Do not doubt it. The Infidel has a league with Sathanas. The false prophet is the great deceiver, who was to deceive the nations. His followers have fellowship with Belzebub. Barbary, whence these Moors came, is a land of sorcery and their neighbor Egypt is the home of magicians. It was in Egypt Moses found sorcerers that could do even the miracles he did, save his serpent swallowed up their's. These Moors deal in magic, and their very language is cabalistic. There may have been magic in the words she sang, for the Holy Church admits that certain words of Arabic are unlawful to be uttered, as they contain the alphabet of the language spoken by fallen angels. One can only be safe by not dealing with the Infidel.' Some further advice mixed with much valuable wisdom, father Godfrey gave the young mountaineer, and then accompanying him to the door of his cave, he dismissed him with his blessing. For several days afterwards Alfonzo studuously and religiously avoided the cliff on which he had listened to the syren song of the Moorish maiden; and once when a straying gazelle compelled him to go upon the cliff for it, he carefully abstained from looking down at the cottage or tower. He seemed to feel that his eyes might jeopardise his soul; yet we cannot deny that he caught himself listening unconsciously, as if he expected the sweet sounds would be repeated; and as he left the rock without hearing them, it must not be concealed that a feeling of disappointment, or an emotion very like it, passed through his bosom. Yet when he had fairly left the rock behind, he felt relieved, and experienced a sensation of escape. But Moorish `sorcery' was destined to prevail over the resolutions of the young mountaineer, if not in one way, in another. About ten days after that on which his sin of listening had been punished by the dispersion of his gazelles, he was standing by a stately ulmos tree watching his herd as they grazed about him, when he heard a loud cry of alarm, followed by fierce barking mingled with the terrific howling of a wolf. Quicker than lightning he grasped his boar-spear, and bounded in the direction of the sounds which led him into a glen of the mountain over which the rocks hung so closely as to exclude the sun at noon-tide. His gazelles in the meanwhile warned by a blast upon his horn, huddled together in a compact body under the tree, and there stood affrighted with wild looks and expanded eyes, trembling in every limb. Alfonzo bounded forward and soon came up with the combatants whom he found in the glen closely engaged in terrific contest. There were two enormous wolves battling with the dog. The pass was very narrow, and the dog, it seemed had been lying in it, so that when the wolves would have passed through on their prowling expedition to reach the gazelles, he had been aronsed and attacked them at the same time giving the alarm. The young herdsman on seeing the unequal battle rushed forward shouting and launched his spear. It passed through the flesh of the dog's shoulder but penetrated at the same time beyond it the heart of one of the wolves. The dog and wolf fell bound together by the spear, and Alfonzo leaped knife in hand upon the remaining brute; but showing his teeth with a ferocious snarl of his turned back lips he fled. It was the work of an instant only for Alfonzo to draw the spear from the neck of the dog and the heart of the dead wolf, and thus armed to pursue the fugitive. The dog was not disabled by the wound, as the spear had only transpierced the skin, and was bounding away after him, when, at his masters's command he returned to guard the gazelles. The glen which was an opening between two cliffs of the Sierra, descended obliquely down the mountain, till lost in a vast forest to the westward. It was a natural road, but from the direction which it took seemed intended only for the convenience of wolves and robbers. The latter, Alfonzo well knew made frequent use of it; and one of the strongest positions which he had been the means of destroying had commanded a portion of this defile. There was no excitement more congenial to the youthful gazelle-keeper than the wolf-chase. The animal led Alfonzo along tle gorge for about a mile at an unflinching pace, occasionally snarling at his pursuer over his back, but not slacking his rapid gallop. Though fleet of foot, Alfonzo found he could not overtake him, and he launched his spear after him, resolved to give up the chase and return to his flock, and also to look after the wound in his dog's neck. Unexpectedly to himself the spear, well launched, glided along the ridge of the wolf's back, and entered the back of his head, into which it deeply forced itself, and then fell out leaving its point broken off in the skull. With a shout of victory the young mountaineer bounded forward and buried his knife in his throat as he dropped bleeding to the ground.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER IX. THE FORTRESS. The wolf thus slain by Alfonzo was one of the largest of his species and bore upon his wiry hide many a scar, inflicted by baffled hunters. `My poor gazelles have one less enemy, monster!' said the young man as he drew his blood-wet knife from the wound and cleaned it in the soil at his feet. He now looked up and around him, and for the first time discovered that he was in the vicinity of a strong-hold once occupied by a party of bandits, which, under their formidable chief El Zegris, he had expelled with great loss to them, when commanding the expedition of Mountaineers already alluded to. The ruin was in sight and not a hundred yards distant, and it occurred to him that the wolves he had slain had made their den in its foundation, and that if he searched the place he might come upon their lair. The idea was no sooner conceived than he resolved to carry it into execution. No one but Alfozo the Destroyer or Gaspar the Wolf-slayer would have thought of going alone into a lonely ruin among the wild mountains when it was likely wolves made it their home. But danger was the element in which the young mountaineer breathed most freely. He delayed only long enough to take the skin of the wolf as a trophy of his success, and then marched forward to the ruin which he had not visited since he had driven El Zegris the bandit chief forth from it at the point of the spear, and came near taking him captive in his band. He found it, to his surprise, almost entirely repaired; the walls, which had been partly thrown down, built up; the gate replaced upon its massive hinges; the portcullis lifted to its place, and the draw-bridge, which had been burned, rebuilt, though rudely, with logs. It bore indeed every trace of having been occupied since the robbers had been ejected. There was a path, too, well trodden, leading from the gate-way down the gorge in the direction of the dark forest that, like an ocean of black waters, spread many leagues in the rear of the mountain, northwardly, He remained standing and gazing upon these signs of its habitation with amazement. He saw at a glance that the bandits, taking advantage of the quiet which had followed the earnest war waged against them, had returned to their fortresses. His first impulse was to conceal his presence from any one within, and, returning to the hamlet, gather a party of his friends and fall upon the place by surprise the same night. But as he closely observed the exterior and seeing no one either upon the look-out above the gate or any where in the vicinity of the walls, curiosity impelled him to a closer scrutiny before giving any alarm, which in the end might have proved wholly unnecessary. He, therefore, cautiously advanced step by step until he found himself across the draw-bridge and standing before the gate which still bore marks of the heavy stone axes by which he, at the head of his comrades, a few months before, had bettered it down and gained entrance into the strong hold. All about the place was as silent as the deep repose of noon could make it. There was not a sound, save the hum of the summer insect on wing and the chirping of a mountain sparrow on a branch that overtopped the wall. The appearance of the repairs was as if they had been but recently made; but yet as if they were intended to resist outward force. `This has been the work of not less than a score of men,' said Alfonzo, as he looked about upon the restored ruin; `but where are the workmen? I will e'en ascertain the meaning of this ere I go away from it. The place must come down again, and the next time level with the ground. This gate is secured only by bars which are put up on the outside. This shows that those who make it their home have gone forth barring it behind them. I will take the liberty of unbarring it and go in; for I must know who are my neighbors on the mountain. He removed two heavy bars, or rather timbers that were placed in deep beds in the door-posts, and the gate swung open of itself. Grasping his wolf-spear, and walking guardedly, like a brave man who means not to be taken by surprise, he advanced into the court. This was a quadrangle sixty feet broad, with small rooms built into the walls on all sides like pigeon-holes, fit dens for robbers.— On each side of the gateway were two large rooms. The place was strewn with the remains of old Gothic altars and columns, it having once been a pagan temple, according to tradition. He entered one of the rooms, and to his great surprise, found that it contained the arms and costume of Moors, while a silver-gilt crescent fastened upon a mace stood up in one corner. It looked like a Saracen guard-house. Amazed and wondering what all this could mean, he opened the opposite room and started back on beholding a Moorish turban and kaftan, rolled up on the ground, and beneath the folds of the turban peering a Moorish beard. He looked closer and saw that there was indeed sleeping at his feet a Saracen soldier or robber, which, he knew not; but he had evidence enough that the place was occupied no longer by Christian free-booters, but that Infidels held it instead. But for what purpose? This he determined to ascertain. On looking around the apartment he saw that it contained Moorish saddles, scymetars, and yatagans, besides, turbans of every color, kaftans, morocco slippers, green, blue, and yellow, and many rich dresses. Filled with surprise at this discovery, he was about to rouse the Moor, and know from his lips what it meant. But he first determined to inspect the whole interior. He walked round the court, looking into each of the recesses, or dens in the wall, and although he found the most of them vacant, he discovered evidence that the rest were occupied; and one of them held two beautiful Arabian horses, caparisoned for the field, who started and opened their large wild eyes, and pricked their small pointed ears in affright, on beholding the stranger. Having satisfied himself that the place was occupied by a Moorish party, which were then absent, he returned to the room by the gate-way, where he had seen the Infidel sentinel asleep. The Moor was still motionless, and Alfonzo possessing himself of his scymetar cried aloud— `Up, Infidel! The Christians be upon thee!' The Saracen sprung to his feet, and instinctively searching for his sword hilt, found his weapon gone. Upon seeing before him the tall athletic form of the young mountaineer, and beholding his scymetar held at his breast, he fell upon his knees and cried for mercy, in broken Spanish. `Mercy, good Christian, mercy in the name of Jesu!' `Infidel dog, to dare to pronounce that name on your polluted lips,' cried Alfonzo, striking him on the mouth with the palm of his hand. `What do you here? Who holds this place?' `If thou wilt spare my life, thou shalt know all!' answered the Moor, who was a stout man of forty, with a grizly beard, and a swarthy visage, now pale with terror. Hast thou taken the fort. Allah guard my head then!' `Who are you, and what do you here?' asked Alfonzo, impatiently. `I am Habib Ben Habib, and I was left here to guard the fortress, but having drunk wine from the Captain's stores, I fell asleep.' `A mussulman drink wine! This is a change in the prophet's faith. Who is thy Captain? Answer me truly!' `El Zegris!' `El Zegris, again! He is a Spaniard and thou a Moor. Besides, he has fled men say, to the Pyrenees!' `My Captain is El Zegris Effendi,' answered the Saracen. `He is a Spaniard or a Moor as suits him. His father was a Saracen, his mother of Andalusia. Once he was chief of the Spanish bandits. Now he is a follower of the prophet, and the chief of a Saracen band.— Instead of flying to the Pyrenees when Alfonzo, the Destroyer, defeated him, he fled for refuge to Cordova. There he became a good Moslem; took service with the Emir, Abdel Alba, and became his friend. But he gave offence to the Emir ere long, who sent to have his head, but El Zegris, with twenty horse, fled the city, and sought shelter here, repairing the place as you see, Effendi.— I am but his poor slave, who aspired to no higher dignity, than to make sherbet for my master, and fight for him when I cant run away; but I assure your highness I am a great coward, an arrant and a most admirable coward, and would not hurt a ligardo. How many fierce Christian devils hast thou on the outside?' `Enough, Moor! So thou art only a slave of El Zegris?' said Alfonzo, looking upon the trembling Moor, whose beard and moustache, with his warlike gear, gave him a ferocious look that greatly belied his real character. `No more, Effendi!' he answered with a low obeisance. `How is it that thou art left alone?' `El Zegris did not expect company. He left me because he has gone on busy work, and needed men who could handle steel better than I do; so he shut me in to cook and look after the horses, and as I told your most garcious Christian highness, I was tempted and drank wine, and the Prophet punished me by making me drunk.' `When did the Zegris ride forth?' `Abut sunrise, Effendi,' answered the slave with a profound salaam at every word; cowardice making the craven rogue most courteous to Alfonzo, whom, under opposite circumstances, he would not hesitated to have branded as a `Christian dog!' `When does he return?' `He bade me have the noon-meal ready for him, as he should be back by the time the sun was overhead.' Alfonzo glanced upward, and saw that the sun was then approaching the zenith. He was brave, but not a bravo. His courage was tempered with prudence. He knew that it would be instant death to be caught by El Zegris and his score of followers in his stronghold. He therefore resolved to take his departure and compel the Moor to go with him, as to leave him behind would be to betray to the robber-chief that his re-occupation of the place was known; while, if the slave was only missed, he might be supposed to have run away. He was, therefore, about to command him to go before him and leave the place, when his ear caught the sound of approaching horses. He sprung to a loop-hole which commanded the entrance, and to his confusion beheld the Moorish party, headed by El Zegris, winding up the gorge, and within thirty yards of the gateway. To escape by the gate would have been impossible. He saw the peril he was in, and all his self-possession was called into exercise to aid him in effecting his escape. The sound of the horses' hoofs clattering over the loose stones of the rugged path had been caught by the slave's quickear, and the two Arabian horses neighing briskly in their stalls showed their consciousness of the approach of their companions. The slave, with the subtle quickness of the Moor, was making for the door to escape to his captain, when Alfonzo laid his grasp upon him and held him firmly. `Stir not!' he cried, as he pressed the scymetar against his breast. `Come with me, and if you utter a word or sound this steel shall silence your tongue forever!' He dragged the Moor hastily along by the collar of his kaftan, and succeeded in gaining one of the vacant rooms which he had before noticed had a large ruinous loop-hole on the forest side. Into this place he thrust the Moor headlong, and springing in after him he closed the door and placed against it a heavy stone which had fallen from the wall above the loop-hole. He then took the turban of the slave, and twisting it bound it firmly across his mouth, so that he could not, even from fear, give any alarm. He rolled him into the corner of the cell, and now climbed up to the loop-hole to see what chances it afforded him for escaping; when, to his deep chagrin, he saw that it overlooked a sheer precipice of sixty feet, which prevented all chances of escape. `Be it so!' said Alfonzo; `a brave man can die but once. I will be patient and hope, while I watch my enemy as he enters.' There was an opening for air left above each door, about the size of a brick, and by standing upon the huge stone he had rolled there, he was enabled to command a view of the gate-way and of the whole of the interior.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER X. THE CAPTIVE MAIDEN. The young mountaineer had hardly taken his position upon the stone by the door when El Zegris came galloping into the court, looking round him with fierce surprise at having found the gate unbarred. `Ho, Habib Ben Habib, what means this? Thou hast lost thy head for thy carelessness!' he cried. `Come forth and answer, for by the beard of the Prophet I will make thee a head shorter.' As he spoke he galloped rapidly round the court, looking in at the open doors of the apartments; and as he passed by the door at which Alfonzo was posted, the corner of his vernish, or Moorish cloak, nearly flapped into his face by the wind of his motion. He was splendidly mounted upon a dun-colored Arabian mare, which had an eye almost as beautiful and intelligent as a woman's, a glossy hide like silk velvet, and nostrils so transparent that the pink light shone through them. Her head was small and elegantly shaped, and her fetlocks as delicate as a deer's. Her movements were all fire and wild grace. Her rider was a young man not above thirty, rather under-sized, but firmly made, with a finely set head, and a proud fierce bearing. He was dressed in a scarlet Moorish cloak, a military turban, ornamented with the green feather of the Caliph's guard, and loose flowing Arabian trousers of white muslin, over which was drawn a pair of long Tunisian green boots. About his waist was loosely knotted a purple sash, to which hung by a double gold chain a jewelled scymetar. The trappings of his horse were also exceedingly rich. His whole appearance was picturesque and striking. His air was that of a man accustomed to command, and wont also to give free rein to his temper. His features were more Spanish than Moorish, though his dark, handsome Arabian eye, betrayed his half Morisco blood. His face was very fine, full of expression, and stamped with great energy and fierce passions. The jet-black beard, flowing to his breast, his raven locks sweeping the wind, his flashing glance and martial bearing, his inimitable horsemanship as he sat in his Barbaric saddle, like a part of the beautiful animal he rode, gave him altogether an imposing appearance, and rivetted the admiration of the youthful gazelle-keeper; albeit Alfonzo had before this crossed blades with him in battle, and well nigh had taken him prisoner. El Zegris lingered an instant at the door of the room in which the Moorish slave had been found by Alfonzo, bending forward from his saddle to peer in. `The slave has fled! By the cross of the Nazarene, if it prove so, he shall die if he be taken.' The rest of his party now came galloping into the court after their chief, who had preceded them by spurring forward, and nineteen in number rode round the area and drew up facing the gate. They were all Moors, save one or two renegade Spanish bandits, whom Alfonzo recognised even under the turban and kaftan.— They were all habited in a fashion similar to that of their chief, though less rich; the colors of their coarse kaftans being brown or blue. Their horses, however, were without exception beautiful animals. Every man was armed with a short spear, in addition to his scymetar at his girdle, and a large two-edged knife stuck in his boot-leg, its only sheath. They were `bearded like pards,' and had the ferocious, reckless look of outlaws, of whatever land or language. There was one of the party, however, which entered the gate, and instead of riding round in column with the rest, turned aside at a gesture from El Zegris, and approached the place where he remained watching the entrance of his troop. This person was a large framed Ethiopian, whose jet-black visage presented a striking contrast with the white turban which overshadowed it. He was, moreover, dressed in white, save a dark colored sash, that held his knife and heavy scymetar. He was mounted upon a bay horse as gigantic as himself, and, what fixed Alfonzo's eyes with surprise and curiosity, he carried in his arms a female figure, her face exposed, and reclining upon his grisly bearded breast. A second glance told Alfonzo that the maiden was insensible, and the torn veil and disarranged vesture, shewed him that she had been lawlessly torn away from her home, and was a prize to El Zegris. From the moment Alfonzo discovered her, he had no eye for the movements of the rest. The Ethiopian stopped his horse in such a position, that he could see her pale features distinctly, as she lay unconsciously upon the hideous breast of the Ethiop. He had never before beheld feminine beauty so perfect. If she were so lovely with her color gone, and her eyes closed, and that expression of sorrow upon her brow, thought Alfonzo, how beautiful must she appear when her face is lighted up by the dazzling splendor of her eyes, and the tint of the rose leaf plays with the smile of beauty upon her cheek and lip! It was impossible for him to gaze upon a lovely girl, Moorish though he saw she was, placed thus in the power of lawless men, without feeling a deep interest awakened for her in his generous breast. He thought of his scarcely less beautiful sister Xariffa, and his cheek burned as he thought how it might have been her, instead of the sweet, hapless stranger, on whom he gazed. He could not remove his eyes from her. As the Ethiop lifted up a mass of her shining raven tresses, that had fallen upon the neck, and mingled with the mane of the horse, and threw them rudely across his arm, his spirit leaped to have the power to hurl him from the saddle and rescue her. `She has not yet revived!' said El Zegris, as he laid his hand upon her forehead, gently rather than rudely. `No, Captain Effendi,' answered the Ethiop, in a hoarse grating voice. `The mountain air will soon restore her! Dismount and bear her into that room!' he added, pointing to an apartment, the door of which was closed. The Ethiop alighted with the graceful form of the beautiful Moor, hanging supine across his arm, as if the weight were nothing to him, and taking a key from his bosom, he opened the door and entered. The apartment was evidently that belonging to the chief himself. The stone pavement of the floor was covered with richly flowered mats, and silken divans ran round three sides of the walls, which were hung with Venetian tapestry. Of these particulars, Alfonzo was enabled to obtain a glimpse, from the position in which he was placed. The Ethiop laid his light burden upon one of the Divan's while the eye of his chief followed him, and then came out and turned the key. `Allah be praised!' said El Zegris; `she is now in safety, and the trouble well off my hands of bringing her hither!' He now turned to his men, and after glancing from one to the other with a rapid eye, as if numbering them, he waved his hand, and then dismounted himself. His followers did the same also, and each man led his horse towards the temporary stalls in the walls of the stronghold. While they were unsaddling them, El Zegris, who had haughtily cast the rein of his mare to the Ethiopian, was looking round sharply for the slave. He then examined the gate, as if to see how he could have removed the bars from the inner-side. `The dog has let himself down by the walls. That he has escaped is clear,' he said, addressing his speech to his lieutenant, a Spanish bandit, though in Moorish costume, who approached him after turning his horse over to one of the men. Alfonzo knew the bandit well, he having been once a mountaineer, and for a murder he had done, fled to the haunts of robbers for protection. `The rogue fears your scymetar and his wind-pipe will some day become acquainted; he knows that he well deserves that such an introduction should take place,' was the reply of the lieutenant, with a coarse laugh. `He has escaped without doubt. I am sorry, for we have no coffee ready, and we are pretty well tired with our foray down the mountain!' `The maid seems to take her capture unkindly.' `Make the maiden no theme for thy speech, Diego!' said El Zegris, with a flashing eye, as he turned away and walked towards the room, where he had ordered the Ethiopian to place her. He turned the key and entered, leaving the door wide open. The maiden lay upon the divan, like a reclining statue of marble. Alfonzo, whose look out was not more than twelve feet from the apartment where she was, saw him place his hand upon her pulse, and shake his head. `This sleep will end in death if I let it go on. I must bleed her!' he cried, and taking a lancet from his sash, which was contained in a morocco case that held a few other small surgical instruments and mendicaments, such as men accustomed to war always carried about with them in those days, he bared her moulded arm, and bandaging it with her torn veil, pierced the full vein. In a few moments, as the blood flowed into a silver basin, held by the huge Ethiopian on one knee at his feet, she opened her eyes, and a shudder passed over her frame, while a faint flush colored her cheek, and deepened the red upon her lips. `She revives,' cried El Zegris. His voice, and the sight of him bending over her, drew from her a cry of terror. She realized at once the circumstances of her situation, and bounding to her feet, she shrieked and would have fled. But her strength failed her ere she had made three steps, and she would have fallen heavily to the floor, but for the interposing arm of the robber-chief. `Nay, be calm, child,' said El Zegris, smiling with the consciousness of possession. `Thy father insulted, me and so, by Allah, did the daughter. Thou shalt be the bride of El Zegris. Thou—' `Never—never!' she cried, putting her hands before her face, with the palms open towards him, and shuddering with horror. `I will not listen to thee. Thou hast ruthlessly torn me from my home, as if I were a Christian slave, rathar than a free Moslem woman.' `Thou art more beautiful, fairest Genilla,' said the chief, `than all the maidens in Christendom else. Be gentle, and be the bride of El Zegris.' `Robber.' `I am now an outlaw; but ere long I shall be an Emir. There is discord at work in Cordova, and El Zegris will be there when the nut is ripe to see what he can do with raising a standard. Andalusia is now the prize of the sharpest scymetar. Come, Genilla, say thou will be mine.' `My spirit shall take flight to Allah, ere it bow to thy will,' answered the young girl with lofty resolution. `I will tame thee.' `Do not drive me to death, chief, What is my dead body to thee? Yet I swear to thee by the Holy pages of the Koran that I will not be thine, and live.' `Dost thou not know, sweet maid, that thou art in my power. I offer thee the honorable place of wife. Thou refusest it, knowing that thou art wholly mine, and that I do thee an honor. No, no; I cannot give thee up. It has cost me too much trouble to possess myself of thee. Thou mayest play at disdain, flash thine eye, and curl thy pretty lip, but it will avail thee nothing. I am no longer a wooer to sue for thy smile, but thy master to command.' `More and more, as thy speech unfolds thy nature, do I hate thee. Each word thou utterest but widens the space between us.' `Sayest thou so,' answered the chief, turning pale with anger, and a bright angry light glowing in his eyes. I will find a way to tame thee. I will leave thee now a while; but first I will take good care that you have no instrument of death; for I do half believe you would try and cheat me out of yourself, if you believed there was no way of escape for you. But as to escape, you can easily see that you have no chance to get free. You are a prisoner in a stronghold in the mountains, a full league and a half from your father's cottage. I leave thee now to better reflections, and Allah be praised whether they favor me or no, thou art mine nevertheless.'</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XI. EL ZEGRIS. It was with the most intense interest, and the deepest sympathy in the fate of the hapless maiden, Moorish though she were, that Alfonzo witnessed what we have related in the foregoing chapter. His heart swelled with indignant emotion, and his cheek burned at the contemplation of her unprotected state. His reverence and love for his sister had made all other maidens sacred in his sight. She was, too, about Xariffa's age, and had the same dark beaming eyes, and flowing dark hair. He watched the robber chief as he left the apartment, locking behind him the door, and placing the key in his girdle. He resolved then that he would endeavor, in securing his own escape, to effect hers also, if it were possible. The beauty and hapless condition of the beautiful Moorish girl, had made their own impression upon his heart; but certain tones of her voice, as she plead eloquently for liberty at the feet of El Zegris, made him believe that he saw captive before his eyes the maiden who had so captivated his senses with her song. The very idea should have made the youth tremble when he recollected the consequences which had followed his listening to her melody. But this was not the effect this assurance produced in his bosom; but it rather increased and gave rest to his awakened interest in her. Like the moth, he would hover around the flame which had singed him. There was an infatuation in the feeling that possessed him. But it was easier to yield to the infatuation than to resist it. As a mere Moorish maiden taken captive it is a question whether Alfonzo, chivalrous as he was by nature, would have gone so far as he did towards effecting her release; but when that maiden was the sweet songstress the echo of whose voice still float ed about his heart, he was inspired by a romantic enthusiasm in her behalf the secret of which lay in a sentiment deep in his bosom which he had never yet analysed, but to which he yielded obedience. The very reason which father Godfrey would have urged to him why he should leave the fair captive to her fate, was the very reason which prompted him to resolve to accomplish her release. Conscience and his religion told him to banish her from his thoughts and think only of himself, whose peril was equal to her own; while a tender interest that lay deeper than mere waywardness, urged him to desire to see her free from the power of El Zegris. `I will escape only with that maiden by my side,' he said, resolutely. `It may be wrong to serve one whom conscience bids me fly, but I cannot resist the impulse. It may be that a spell is upon me, and that this kindness towards her that warms my bosom is produced by Moorish enchantments that I may be induced to free her. However it be I shall obey the feeling. I could not feel myself free to go forth and leave the poor beautiful tearful maiden behind me. If I escape she escapes also with me, if she will accept freedom at the hand of a Christian. This El Zegris shall be disappointed. He shall lose his bride and he shall know that Alfonzo the Destroyer has stolen her from his hand.' He now watched the progress of things in the court. The Moorish horsemen, after having taken care of their steeds, gathered about a large fire which one of their number built in the midst of the court, and began each to cook for himself the dinner which the unlucky Habib Ben Habib should have had in readiness. A kid, stolen from some herd on the mountain, was roasted upon sticks, and with their knives they cut off pieces and devoured them with coarse barley bread, washing the whole down with sour wine, which was sipped in an old silver cup out of a copper vessel near by. El Zegris and his lieutenant Diego ate apart on a broad seat placed just within the door of the room which contained the arms of the party, the apartment which Alfonzo had first entered on coming into the fortress. All their proceedings were plainly visible to Alfonzo. He noted everything with the closest attention. In the meanwhile, Ben Habib, his prisoner, was becoming very restless, rolling about and blowing noisely for breath. He saw that it was necessary to silence him and getting down from the stone he placed his hands upon the now motionless slave as he lay against a broken pillar curiously carved with a capital of entwined asps and said sternly, `If you are not still you shall die. You have heard what El Zegris has said. If he hears you and discovers you and me he will be sure to take your head off as well as mine.' `I know it, Effendi,' gasped the Moor, succeeding in removing the turban from his mouth. `Oh, do not let me die for want o' breath. I have small nostrils, as Allah knows, and I can't get wind enough in and out at them for my body! If thou wilt let me breathe and trust to me, may the Prophet pull me out o' Paradise by the hairs o' my beard if I speak above my breath. I know well I am taller by the head while I am in here than I should be out there.' Alfonzo reflected a moment. He was convinced that he could safely trust him, as he saw that he was fully convinced his safety depended on being undiscovered. `I will trust you, Ben Habib. But I swear to you by your Prophet that if you lift your voice above a whisper, or speak when you are not spoken to, I will slay you on the spot.' With these words Alfonzo unbound the turban from his mouth and returned it to him to fold again about his shining bald pate. Ben Habib was full of gratitude and kissing the hem of Alfonzo's robe, said he would be his slave and serve him faithfully if he would deliver him out of the hands of the fierce El Zegris. The Moor seemed to think that the young mountaineer, alone and surrounded by foes as he was, would yet escape his enemies in safety; and Alfonzo too possessed this very kind of confidence in himself. The idea of being taken prisoner or slain by El Zegris did not give him a moment's uneasy thought. He felt strong in his own courage and energy. He now returned once more to his look-out, while Ben Habib climbed up to the loop-hole to survey the depth below. He measured it with his eye, and looked by no means satisfied at the result of the survey. He neverthless slid down again to the floor, and began to unwind his kaftan, and proceeded to tear it into pieces. At the noise, Alfonzo called to know what he was doing. `I am making a rope to let myself down the wall, Effendi. My sash and turban, my kaftan and trousers, torn up with economy, will reach full fifty feet, and a jump of ten more may be saved if thou wilt lend thy bernash to me to tear up!' `Hist! Let this be the last way of escape when all others fail,' said Alfonzo. `I would try this first. El Zegris may take a notion to have all the empty rooms looked into after me; and if he finds this door fast on the inside, it is all up with thee and me—whip would go off our heads in the stoning of a date.' `Make no more noise with that rending, and be silent. I will devise a way to get out of this. Worse come to the worst we can fight our way out.' `Allah forfend, good neighbor Effendi. I am no man at the sword—I am better at a spit. Let us have no fighting, I pray thee!' `Silence, Moor!' cried Alfonzo sternly. He then directed his scrutiny into the court with the closest attention. The Moors, having dined, had thrown themselves upon their mats and horse-cloths, to sleep in the shade, and repose after the fatigue of their morning's expedition. In a little while all, except two, who were still drinking wine by the fire, were stretched at length in sleep. El Zegris and his lieutenant still remained eating dried dates, waited upon by the Ethiopian. At length El Zegris rose and walked slowly round the court-yard, gazed a moment on the sleepers, glanced into the stalls, examined the security of the gate, and then ordered the two men by the fire to take their scymetars and do guard duty. The men murmured at being compelled to leave their sour wine, but obeyed.— The lieutenant Diego, without more ado, threw himself at length on the divan upon which he had taken his dinner, and shading his face with his turban, was soon buried in deep rose. El Zegris alone, with the two sentinels, was awake and vigilant. For his men to sleep after dinner was as customary, in that climate, as to sleep in the night. They were, moreover, better fitted by repose in the heat of noon for the midnight expeditions upon which El Zegris led them. At length, after walking round the court and observing every thing thoroughly, like a skilful chief, he stopped before the door of the apartment in which the maiden had been shut up. Alfonzo's heart throbbed violently, and his grasp was firmer upon the hilt of Ben Habib's scymetar, which he held in his hand. The Ethiopian came near him, and held up before his eyes the bloody wolf-spear which Alfonzo had dropped as he hurried from the guard-room with his hold upon the Moor's collar. The Ethiopian had just found it in the corner whither it had rolled aside, unheeded by its owner, who did not miss it with the scymetar in his grasp. He now saw it again with surprise, aud closely observed the result of the discovery. `What is it?' impatiently asked El Zegris, whose foot was already on the step of the door which led to the apartment of his beautiful captive. `A mountaineer's wolf-spear. It has blood on it still moist.' `How came you by it?' asked El Zegris, taking it in his hand and looking at it closely. `I found it just now in that room, upon the floor. No doubt it will help to account for Ben Habib's absence, and the open gate.' `By the beard of Mahomet, you say well, Yussuf. This is strange! Is it a man's blood on it?' `No, a wolf's.' `How can you tell?' `Man's blood dries red: a brute's darkens and becomes brown: this is brown.' `It is not the slave's blood then! But how came this spear here?' `It must have been left here.' `But by whom? If this place had been visited by a herdsman, as it is not likely, for they seldom venture this side o' the Sierra, it would have been plundered.— Nothing seems gooe. Yet the gate was found open and this spear picked up; and Ben Habib is no where to be found. I will examine this matter by and by. Guards, see that you keep vigilant watch, and on no account open the gate. We have enemies that have found us out. Yussuf, keep awake, and if anything occurs to cause alarm, sound the trumpet call.' With these words El Zegris threw open the door of the apartment in which the maiden had been imprisoned, and as he entered, she darted past him with a bound and a cry of mingled defiance and terror. He caught her around the waist and detained her, with a laugh of victory. `No, no, my pretty bird. You do not escape so easily. Do not be so cruel as to fly me thus. There is many a maiden that would gladly become the bride of El Zegris, yet I choose only thee.' `I would thank thee to put me to death,' she cried imploringly. `I hate thee, Julio.' `Not half so much as I love thee.' `Give me till to-morrow to decide,' she cried ia despair. `I see the ruse. Thou wishest to gain time. But I will not be too hard with thee. I will give thee till the sun go down. Wilt thou decide by then?' `I will,' she answered, half suffocated with her emotions. `Leave me now. I had hoped thou hadst relented. But leave me now.' `I had also hoped that thou hadst relented. Say that thou wilt be my bride, Genilla, star of my life, and I will ride with thee to-morrow, in open day, into Cordova, and at the Mosque there the Mufti shall wed thee to me.' `It is false what thou utterest. Thou darest not appear in Cordova for thy head, robber. But at sun-down thou shalt have my answer. Leave me.' `Cruel as beautiful, thou seest that I am thy slave and obey thee,' he answered with an air of haughty superciliousness, while a scornful smile curved his dark lip. He then slowly withdrew and turned the key as before, saying significantly as he did so, `At sunset.'</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XII. THE ENTERPRIZE PLANNED. The youthful gazelle-keeper now in his heart resolved that he would free the maiden from the power of El Zegris, even at the sacrifice of his life. There were, perhaps, two motives operating to spur him on to this chivalrous enterprise; one, and the most powerful, a deep interest in the sweet singer who had so enthralled his heart, and the other, a desire to disappoint the robber chief. Touehing his own escape, he saw that it could be effected by the mode which had been suggested by Ben Habib; for he well knew that the robes of both, torn up into cords, would be of sufficient length and strength to let him and the Moor down the precipice, when their escape would be easy by the defile of the mountain. But Alfonzo was not one who could at any time think only of self-preservation, and more particularly now, when he was to leave behind, in the power of El Zegris, a lovely girl, who had not been out of his thoughts for a day in the past three weeks, and whose voice floated like strains of music from the walls of Paradise, through his dreams night after night. `I will not seek my own safety and leave the maiden in the power of El Zegris,' he said firmly, as Ben Habib once more ventured to propose to him to escape by the window. `How can you do her any good, Effendi?' asked Ben Habib in astonishment. `There is El Zegris my master and twenty men that fear neither man nor spirit of evil. They will cut thee in pieces and make kabobs of thee and me. Let me tear up my kaftan. We had best be diligent and get away while they sleep!' El Zegris is not asleep. He is standing by the door of the armoury.' `He will lay down by and bye. He always takes his sleep after noon.' `No. He walks away and now gives an order to the Ethiopian. The black leaves his side and crosses to the stalls He is saddling the chief's horse. Now he puts the saddle on his own.' `El Zegris is going to ride out, I dare say, in search of me, Effendi;' answered Ben Habib, with tremor in every limb. `Rather to ascertain if any enemy is lurking about; for he is examining my wolf-spear with attention, and evidently is disturbed at its being found here. He goes out to see if there are any signs of his enemies abroad.' `That is it. He will examine the ground closely for footsteps of man or horse. I am grateful to Allah I am safe in here.' `The sentry is unfastening the gate, tho' not before looking through a loop-hole over it to see that all is clear on the outside of the walls. The Ethiopian now leads the two horses across the court towards his master. El Zegris vaults into his saddle fully armed, and bears in his hand my wolf-spear. He evidently means to see if he can find anybody, man or wolf; in the neighborhood to account for the blood on the spear. `It will be more of a puzzle for him to tell how the spear came here, Effendi,' answered Ben Habib with a faint attempt at a smile. `I hope he will get his neck broke before he comes back again. Now his going out will keep us in. If we get down the rock, and into the defile he will find me, and then, Mash-Allah, Ben Habib will have no more use for a turban.' `Hist! he speaks with the Ethiopian, and points towards the door of the room where his prisoner is shut up, and then casts a glance of suspicion towards his lieutenant Diego.' `He is afraid to leave the fortress, and leave her to the power of the renegade. By the soul of the Prophet, he is right,' said Ben Habib, who stood near Alfozo, and listened with great interest to his reports of what passed without in the court-yard of the strong-hold. `It is plain that he fears him. The Ethiopian makes a salaam with his face to the ground, and goes towards the door where he sits leaning his head against the pillar, and with his naked scymetar grasped in his right hand. Te enter the place one would first have to encounter the gigantic barbarian.' `I have seen him, Effendi,' said Ben Habib, `I have seen him take up two stout Moors, one in each hand, and dash their heads together three feet from the ground, till they roared for mercy.' `El Zegris waves his hand to one of the sentries to mount the Ethiop's horse. He obeys, and the chief rides forth, followed closely by him. The gate is shut, but not barred, for I heard El Zegris say that it must be left so as to admit him suddenly, in case he should be compelled to to return suddenly.' `I hear the clatter of the horses' hoofs as they go over the draw-bridge. Allah be praised; may they never come back again. Now, Effendi, what shall we do? If we go out of the loop-hole, as I proposed, El Zegris, whose eye is like an eagle's, will be sure to see us, and I should land upon his pike-head, spitted like a goose. `Be patient, and I will devise a way of escape for us both and the lady also,' answered Alfonzo. `Do not think of the woman, Effendi. Women are made to do men mischief. Every evil in the world hath come o' woman. If it had not been for a woman, El Zegris would not have left here after one, and I should not have been left alone, and captured by you and locked up here and in danger of my head.' `If it had not been for a woman you would never have been born, Ben Habib, so let the matter end there.' `Mash Allah; that is but the beginning of it,' answered the Moor, pulling his beard and shrugging his shoulders. `Now Effendi, if thou wilt tell me how I am to get out of this, I will pray Allah for thy soul's safety when it crosses the bridge of a single hair that leads to Paradise.' `Silence, Ben Habib. They babble will awake these robbers, and they will have thee by thy beard ere thou knowest it. `Bismillah! I shall know it when they do; the curse of the Prophet light upon them.' Alfonzo having seen the chief and his single follower ride forth, and the gate closed, but not fastened, and having seen the Ethiopian seat himself by the door, as a guardian Cerebus of the impassioned maiden, began to conceive in his mind some way in which he could avail himself of the present condition of things, to effect not only his own escape, but the liberation of the maiden. The whole interior of the court-yard, with its numerous little rooms, or cells in the wall opening into it, with its groups of Moors reposing in different parts of it, under the shadows of the western side, with the embers of the late fire in the centre, was open to his gaze. The Moorish sentry at the gate had seated himself upon a stone; Diego, the lieutenant, was asleep on the divan under the eaves of the guard-room, and the Ethiop leaned upon his scymetar, looking dozingly over the sleeping men, and occasionally nodding his head over the hilt of his weapon. Alfonzo watched his motions until, at length, he had the satisfaction of seeing him droop his huge head upon his shoulder, and remain motionless in the profoundest repose. The only person that seemed to be awake under the drowsy influence of that warm sunny afternoon, was the sentry at the gate. The horses in their stalls, by their stamping, and occasionally neighing, alone broke the profound stillness, which, like the repose of midnight, reigned within the fortress. Alfonzo now saw that the time had come for him to effect his escape, if he ever intended to leave the den of robbers alive. He was impatient to go, for he thought of his poor, watchful dog, his defenceless flock, his anxious sister and father. Every moment was precious to him. El Zegris might not be out long, and the attempt, if made at all, must be made, he saw, at once. `Ben Habib,' he said, turning to the Moor, give me thy turban. Fold it on my head as thou wearest it, and thy people!' The Moor obeyed in silent admiration. `Now thy kaftan. I want thy Moorish trowsers also! Not a word. Invest me with all thy apparel; for I am to play the Infidel for a little while.' `By the Prophet's beard, wilt thou leave thy servant as naked as he was born, Effendi?' `No, thon shalt have a fair exchange. Put on my clothes!' `This will be turning a Moslem into a Christian, as well as a Christian into a Moselm.' `Not a word of objection. I am to effect thy escape, as well as my own.' `I shall be taken and slain as a Christian dog.' `Thou hadst better be slain as a Christian than—as thou art sure to be if I leave the here—as a Moslem dog.' `Thou speakest wisdom! Now thou art a Moslem to any man's eye. By the beards of Islam, thou wouldst be taken by the Prophet himself for one of his own followers.' `I am willing to be for the present.— Now I wish to have thee second me, and obey me in every thing, if thou lovest thy life.' `I love it better than I do any thing else I know of in this miserable world, the curse of Allah be upon it, that ever I was born into it, to be now in danger of losing my head. Look at me! Am I not a Christian without suspicion of ever having seen the inside of a Mosque.— Bismillah—it—Allah! I am like to loose my head either as a Christian or Moslem. I will stick close to thy skirts, Effendi.' `Thou must fight too, if need be.— Remember that thy life hangs upon thy valor,' `Then I fear me my neck will hang by a rope also. I am better at spitting fowl than men, Effendi.' `I am now about to open the door, and go boldly out. I shall, if noticed, by the sentinel or any who may awake, be taken for one of their number, as I shall keep my turban thus well over my brow.— My first step will be to go to the stalls, and saddle three of the best steeds.' `Then what wilt thou do?' `I will make thee come out of this hiding-place, and hold them ready to mount!' `Bismillah! They will not take me for one of their followers. Canst thou not, while thou art about it, bring a turban and kaftan, and trowsers from the guard-room there. I will put them on in a second, noble Effendi.' `I will try if I can, without awakening Diego, who sleeps there. But if I cannot you must obey me, nevertheless, and hold the horses. No one will observe, for the sentinel is yielding to the general influence, and is bobbing his head to and fro, as if it was balanced on wires.' `I must obey, Effendi. I will do my best,' answer Ben Habib, in a desponding tone. `Thou hast no alternative, but to remain here, then, and await thy fate from the scymetar of El Zegris when he returns; for he will assuredly take off thy head for thy carelessness in letting me in. Now, watch my movements, and when thou seest me cross the court after saddling the horses, you sally forth noiselessly and take them, and lead them after me. It shall not be my fault if there are not three riders upon their saddles in a moment after scouring across the draw-bridge.' Alfonzo now cast one more observing glance over the sleeping court-yard, and then rolled the stone back from the door, and slowly opened it. He stepped forth, his scymetar in his hand, and habited from head to foot like a Moor. He closed the door behind him, leaving Ben Habib peering through a narrow crevice, his face pale with fear, and his large eyes expanded with expectation. His prayers to Allah went with him for his success, for upon it depended his own safety. It was, therefore, with the deepest interest, that he followed his movements. Alfonzo, after finding himself fairly in the open court-yard, proceeded towards the stalls. He found, to his great joy, two horses saddled, the same which had been found there by him, when he entered the fort. All he had to do, was to tighten their girths, and bit them. He threw a saddle upon a third horse, and then leading the three out, he beckoned to Ben Habib. But he had to make the signal thrice, before the Moor came forth with a face blanched by terror, increased by his Christian costume. But Alfonzo saw that the risk would be too great for him to try to pass into the armoury, by the sleeping lieutenant. `Now lead these horses, and hold them before you door for me,' said Alfonzo, as he left him and walked round in the shadows of the court, towards the guarded door of the apartment which contained the beautiful Moor.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XIII. THE RESCUE. The critical moment for action, upon which his own life as well as the happiness and safety of the Moorish maiden depended, had now arrived, and the young gazelle-keeper felt the need of all his coolness, as well as of his courage. Slowly he advanced towards the door, on the threshold of which the Ethiop reclined—a giant in stature and strength— his head bowed upon his breast, and buried in profound sleep. The Moorish sentinel at the gate raised his eyes as Alfonzo approached the Ethiopian, but merely towards him: he closed them again. Alfonzo saw in this act proof of the perfection of his disguise; for the sentry had evidently taken him for one of the Moors walking about in preference to sleeping. Taking a firmer grasp upon the hilt of the scymetar, Alfonzo now strode rapidly forward, and, passing by the Ethiopian, came suddenly upon the sentinel, whom he caught by the beard and, at a single blow with his scymetar, sent the Moor to his Propnet. It was the act of an instant. The victim of necessity uttered no groan, but fell dead across the stone upon which he was seated. Alfonzo with a strong arm then swung back the heavy gates, and leaving them wide open, he bounded lightly towards the Ethiopian, and leaping upon the giant buried his steel deep into his breast. The African rose convulsively to his full height, tossed his arms wildly in the air above his head, and then pitched headlong forward, at the foot of one of the circular, serpent-entwined barbaric altars in the fortress, and struck upon the ground with a sound that made the court-yard ring again, and to vibrate with the shock, while Alfonzo springing upon him once more struck him to ensure his death. Instantly three or four Moors were awake and upon their feet. `The horses, Ben Habib!' cried Alfonzo. `This way quickly. Rescue, lady! rescue!' he called to the maiden. `I have slain your guard, and now will open the door for thy escape!' With this he took the massive scymetar of the Ethiopian, and wielding the ponderous weapon as he would have done a battle-axe, he broke the door down and sprung across it into the apartment. There stood the Moorish maiden with eager face, her hands clasped, and her head bent forward between fear and wonder and hope. `Ask no questions, lady! Know that I am the foe of El Zegris, and risk my life to save thee. Wilt thou commit thyself to my guidance! `Yes, oh yes!' she cried, yet shrinking instinctively from the presence of a stranger. But there was something in the tones of his voice, more than in his words, that gave her confidence, and assured her that she was not flying from one enemy into the power of another. `I go with you—only save me from El Zegris!' she added, grasping his hand. `Then mount with me upon one of these horses. The way is open before us. Delay not a moment, the Moors are arising.' With these words he caught her up, and the next moment was seated in the saddle with her in his arms. There was no time to place her upon the other horse. Ben Habib no sooner beheld him mounted, than springing forward he dashed first out of the gate, and just in time cleared the portal to avoid a blow of a yataghan from one of the Moors, who had bounded forward to stop his progress. Alfonzo was met by three of them in his passage to the gate; but with the heavy scymetar of the Ethiopian he cut two of them down and rode over the third. He turned his head for a second and shouted back, `Tell the Zegris that Alfonzo the Destroyer has taken his bride away.' The next moment he was threading across the bridge, leaving confusion, alarm and amazement behind him in the fortress. The Moors were now all awake, and seizing their arms before he got across the moat, ran to the walls, and a score of spears and lances were sent after him, but fell harmlessly about his path, as he flew like the wind—but still outstripped by Ben Habib, who went down the rocky pass as if he had neither neck or head to break. The astonished Moors finding their sentinel dead, the Ethiopian slain, and seeing the surprising escape of what seemed to them a Christian and a Moslem mounted upon two of their best horses, the latter carrying on his saddle bow the Moorish captive, knew not what to say, or how to understand it all. But when they heard his defying cry which told who he was, fear seized them. They increased their confusion by asking a hundred questions of one another, which none could answer. They believed they were surrounded by mountaineers. Diego soon recovered his presence of mind, and seeing no other enemies, ordered the whole party into the saddle to pursue the fugitives, whoever they were. But they refused to stir to a man, without El Zegris. The daring act they had witnessed, with the dread name which had been shouted back to their ears, paralyzed them. The third horse still galloped by the side of Alfonzo, held fast by the rein, and when he got to the foot of the defile, he transferred the maiden to the saddle upon it, and thus side by side they flew down the mountain. Not a word was spoken by either. Flight—safety—were only in the minds of both. Ahead of them rode at an unflinching pace the affrighted Ben Habib, laying on with fist and heels, and glowing, as if pursued by wolves. From the heights above, the Moor sent cries of defiance, and lances that fell short; but none came forth to pursue. Not even Diego crossed the portal, but believing that the mountaineers were in force near by, and that he would fall into an ambuscade, he ordered the gates to be closed, and the garrison to stand at arms ready to repel the expected assault; for that the person who had entered the fort and carried off the maiden, slaying the sentry and the Ethiopian, must have been backed by a large force, he felt confident. He was anxious, too, for the safety of El Zegris, whom one of the Moors said he recollectas he was going to sleep, having seen ride forth accompanied by Ali Benish his trumpeter. `This is all a strange work,' ejaculated Diego, as he gazed upon the bodies of the two men. `One cant well say what is done when one is asleep; but things, look as if the devil had been paying us a visit. How that man who rode forth with the maiden on his saddle ever got inside I know not. Yet as he rode out he must have rode in.' `He was mounted on the captain's dun mare, that he keeps for holidays,' said one of the Moors. `So I thought I had seen the horse before; but he rode on like the wind. And that was one of ours that he led too, I suppose.' `It belongs to Aben Hafel.' `Yet it was not Alfonzo the Destroyer who had the maiden. He, whoever he was, was a Moor. The person who rode ahead alone was the young mountaineer chief.' `If ever there were two heads made on the same block,' said one of the Moorish robbers, `the head on that man's shoulders was as like that of Ben Osmin as two eyes under one brow. I made a stroke at him, believing him to be a Christian dog, as he rode out, and he drew up his eyes and uttered a yell that none but the gullet of Ben Osmin could have given voice to. Besides, I knew the board and the bottle-nose.' `Then who in the name of St. Peter of Rome was the turbaned fellow who rode so gallantly, and shouted back the name of Alfonzo?' asked Diego. `It was the Christian himself,' said another of the renegade Spanish robbers who stood by. `I saw him when he defeated our captain, and heard his voice resounding above the fight. It was the same voice. He spoke for himself and not for the one in the Christian garb, who rode ahead.' `Then I have it,' said Diego, as the riddle seemed to resolve itself slowly to his apprehension. `This Alfonzo has met Ben Huzzar, who you know we found not when we returned, he has met him outside and, changing garbs with him, has, by his means, through his treachery or his fears, got entrance into the fort while we slept, slew the sentinel and the Ethiopian, and so carried off the maiden bodily. This is all the explanation I can give for it, especially as, El Melec here says that he heard El Zegris when he went out order the sentinel to leave the gate ajar for his return. This must be the truth. But more than this, Alfonzo would never have ventured inside a fortress in broad day. When El Zegris returns he will foam and chafe life a tiger to find his mistress stolen and we all asleep the while. But as we are all alike to blame, he will have to take all our heads if any; so the very magnitude of the offence will be our safety. I care not for the loss of the maiden, nor for that matter will any of us weep for the death of this mass of Ethiopian bone and flesh. I will let them lay where they are till El Zegris returns, and in the meanwhile will keep our defences in case that this daring mountaineer should have a force at hand, as is likely. If El Zegris be not watchful, he will be in danger! I wonder what sent him abroad. Hark! there is a shout. There clangs steel against steel in the defile below! To horse! There is a combat! El Zegris is no doubt in peril. Who will follow me?' Four of the Moors leaped into their saddles at the same instant that he did. The gates were thrown open, and like a whirlwind the party dashed across the moat and soon diappeared to the eyes of those who watched them from the walls. El Zegris had left the fortress for the purpose of satisfying himself touching the wolf-spear, which had been found in the interior of his stronghold. The blood upon it he believed to be either that of Ben Habib or of a wolf, slain near the fort; but he suspected it to be the blood of the former, who had been slain by the owner of the spear, and his body cast over the cliff. He, therefore, after getting down the path to the foot of the rock on which the tower stood, rode round the base of it, looking for the body of his slave. But nothing appeared to confirm his suspicions. He carefully, also, watched the neighborhood, which was a wild scene of rocks overthrown, tangled forest and barren pinnacles that towered like minerets, seeming to invite the crescent to crown their sharp points. He rode, scymitar in hand, like a man who expects an enemy to start out from behind every covert. After riding quite around the elevated spur of the peak on which his stronghold was perched, without finding the body of his slave, he turned into the gorge which led over the shoulder of the mountain in the direction of the hamlet on the southern side. He dismounted in this path, and giving his reign to his follower, he carefully walked along, examining the ground and the stones, and even noticing the spears and grass to ascertain if a foot-step either of man or horse had recentiy disturbed it. He had not proceeded far before he saw a small pebble that had been brushed from its bed in the soil, its moist side being turned upward and the little clayey cavity in which it had been half imbedded, was still damp and smooth, not being even sun-dried.— This was a proof to him that some one had been in the path not long before. He continued his search and a little ways further came upon the print of a foot. He saw that it was not a Moorish sharp-pointed boot, but the broad sandal track of a mountaineer. `I have now evidence enough that some Christian dog has found his way into the fort in my absence, and that the spear belongs to the owner of the foot that pressed its print into the soil here!' While he was examining the ground farther, his followers, who had gone forward a few paces, leading his horse, suddenly cried out that the horses would not move, and that they acted as if a wolf was near. Upon looking up, El Zegris saw the animals running backwards, moving their ears and snorting with alarm. He immediately sprung into his saddle, and levelling his spear, rode for ward, urging his reluctant steed with its sharp point. He had proceeded but a few steps when his horse reared and nearly threw him, and wheeling about would have galloped away. Directly in the path lay a dead wolf, and a vulture was balancing himself on his large dark wings above its head, fiercely picking out its eye. A shout from the chief sent him soaring away to settle slowly upon the top of a scathed oak. El Zegris, unable to get his horse nigher, leaped to the ground and approached the wolf, which he found had been recently slain by a spear thrust, from which the blood still oozed out upon the earth.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XIV. THE PURSUIT. The sight of the dead wolf, with the spear-wound in his head, was hardly needed to confirm the suspicions of El Zegris that some mountaineer had been his visitor, and that the person who slew the wild animal and he who entered the fortress were the same he was convinced by finding the broken point of the spear he held in his hand sticking in the bone of the wolf's skull. This proof was all he required. `Some wolf-hunter has slain the beast here, and then, wandering up to the fort, which he supposed vacant, he entered, or was admitted by the slave, who left with him or was slain in a quarrel. There are no other enemies about,' continued El Zegris, as if satisfied with what he had discovered. `Yet this person, whoever he was, will report that the fort is occupied again, That I should be found out here, ere long, I had no doubt; but it will take more than a force of mountaineers to dislodge me again from this place, if I choose to hold it. But I shall hold it only till I see how events are going to turn in Cordova. The revolution may break out to-morrow. I shall then leave the fort as empty as I found it and try my fortunes with some one of the Emirs.— His standard who is likely to conquer I shall rally under.' These words were addressed partly to his follower, but were more the self-uttered thoughts of his mind than intended for the car of the trumpeter. `It is a large wolf, Effendi l' said the man as he drew near and gazed on the dead animal in the path, which it quite blocked up. `A monster of his speeies. It was a true eye and strong man that launched this spear. It was either Gaspar the Wolf-slayer or his son, whom Allah confound! If I e'er meet with him again, we part not till I have avenged my last defeat. For a more youth—a gazelle-herd-boy, without skill or experience, to conquer me and drive me and mine from the Sierras, is an ignominy I shall not bear unavenged.' `It would be easy in the night to sally upon the hamlet where they dwell and come upon them by suprise,' said the Moor. `Thou art giving words to my own thoughts, Melec. I shall not long delay my vengeance.' `Here are letters carved on the end of the spear. They are Christian characters, which I do not read.' `Let me see them. I have heard these mountaineers mark their spears, so that if it be carried off by a wolf, after it has pierced him, and the animal is found dead, it may be known to whom its hide belongs. Let me read. This is the name of my foe.' `Gaspar!' `No. Alfonzo, whom my men call the Destroyer. This spear is his. The wolf's hide is his; and would to Allah he would come and take it while El Zegris has his foot upon it.' `If this be the wolf of that man, and it was he who went into the fort and left the spear,' said the Moor with some alarm, `I would rather he would keep away.' `I know he is brave, and so, too, is El Zegris. Whoever knew me to show fear? I would forfeit a thousand years in Paradise to see this Alfonze here and avenge upon him my wrongs.' `There are few men that would care to meet him in this place,' answered the Moor, looking round. `I would recommend that we return to the fortress.— `Hark! what shouting is that from it?' he cried, looking up the mountain to the stronghold, an angle of which only was in sight, about three hundred yards distant, the rest of it being concealed by a projection of a cliff overhanging the deep gorge in which they were. `There is confusion among them!' exclaimed El Zegris. `Hark! that was the clash of steel. Listen! a galloping across the resounding bridge over the moat! To horse and let us see what this means.' He vaulted across the back of his horse, and giving him rein galloped back the way he had come. A turn in the defile brought him in full view of the draw-bridge and part of the tower, in the gate of which he saw his men brandishing their scymetars, and shouting and sending their lances after a person on horseback, who was thundering across the draw-bridge, as if in pursuit of another in the dark garb of a mountaineer. For an instant the two horses with their riders were in full view; but they were the next moment lost in the deep path down which they were careering. `The Christian dog has been discovered in the fort and is pursued!' cried El Zegris. `He who pursued him had a female, I am sure; and the lances were sent after him more than after the head one,' said Melec, who continued to ride on at speed after his chief. `Then it was so! I was not sure, but thought the hind one carried a female!' answered El Zegris. `Of that I am sure, Captain.' `On then—onward without slacking rein. There is no woman in the fort to come out of it but Genilla, and he who bore her forth is Diego and none else. Allah il Allah to the rescue!' he shouted, brandishing his scymetar, and burying his spurs deep into the flanks of his horse. The path-way which led down the mountain's side from the fort, ran at first at a sharp angle of descent northwardly, and then making a sudden turn, ran south in a zig-zag line, thus making a succession of terraces. The wolf had been slain on the second terrace below, and from this, in looking up, persons descending the first or higher terrace were visible until they began to enter that deeper part of it where the angle was made. The two parties were now approaching each other, one ascending towards the deep gorge at the angle, and the other descending into it. There was also at this angle a defile, which opened westerdly and descended towards the forest, and so round by the east side of the mountain; the same ravine by which El Zegris and his whole party had returned to the tower, bringing the Moorish maiden their captive. El Zegris would not have galloped forward at such speed up the steep path had he not feared that the fugitives would take the eastern gorge, and so escape. That the three persons were the Christian Alfonzo and Diego bearing off Genilla, he had no doubt. He had, therefore, a three-fold motive to urge him onward, and to nerve his arm to combat. The portion of road along which he was now galloping was concealed from the tower by a brow of beetling rocks. Alfonzo resolved to bear his fair charge to the hamlet, and thence conduct her under a strong escort, if necessary, to her home. But the Moor Ben Habib was ignorant of this determination, and upon coming to the opening at the angle which led eastward down the mountains, he took it without hesitation, and as Alfonzo passed it he could just see the top of his bald head disappearing in the depths of the gorge. He could not but smile, serious as his present situation was, at the headlong equestrianism of the terrified Moor, thus riding for his head. `The slave flies with fear for wings,' he said to the maiden; `I am glad to see thee so calm. Still retain thy courage and self-possession, and ere long thou wilt be in safety.' `Who are you that thou art risking life for me?' asked the maiden. `Thy dress is that of a Moor, but thy speech and face betray thee to be a Christian.' Alfonzo did not reply; he had turned the angle and his eye fell upon the figure of El Zegris coming up the gorge at full speed. The two horsemen discovered each other simultaneously. Alfonzo had loooked for a meeting with the chief somewhere in the gorge on his return to his tower. He now recognised him, and at the same moment the chief saw and recognised the maiden whom he had destined for his bride. He reined up and took a second glance at the turbaned horseman by her side, but was amazed instead of seeing the features of his lieutenant Diego to behold those of the youthful mountaineer-chief his direct foe. Even the turban could not disguise or hide his well-remembered face from El Zegris, who never forget the features of a foeman, especially of one by whom he had been humbled. `Lady, rein up and remain here and I will free thee from thy tyrant and make thee a free passage to liberty,' he said, putting his hand upon the bit of her horse and reining him backward. He then grasped firmly the hilt of the scymetar which he had taken from the Ethiopian and charged upon the robber chief, who, taken by surprise at discovering so formidable an atagonist where he expected to cope only with Diego, seemed to hesitate whether to withstand the onset or retreat for better vantage ground, for he was lower in the gorge than his antagonist. But Alfonzo's headlong charge upon him gave no time for reflection. He spurred aside as he came upon him and endeavoured to parry the thrust which was made at his side. But his scymetar shivered like glass at the touch of Alfonzo's weapon, and the guard of the hilt striking him in the breast hurled him from his saddle to the earth. His follower without waiting to see the result had in the outset leaped from his horse and climbed a cliff with the agility of an ape, and was full fifty feet in the air when his chief rolled over upon the ground. Alfonzo reined up and dismounted and pressing his foot upon his chest said, `I do not wish to kill thee. Ask thy life and swear never to disturb the peace of this maiden whom I have rescued from thy power, and I will let thee go free!' `I will not take my life at thy hand, slave!' growled the fallen chief in a tone and with a scrowl of defiance. `Then I will give it thee. I would not shock this maiden's eyes by slaying thee before them; but I will mark thee and destroy thy power of doing mischief.' With these words he raised his weighty scymetar and suddenly letting it fall upon the right arm of El Zegris as it lay stretched out upon the ground he severed the hand above the wrist at a blow. The robber howled with rage and pain, and an exclamation from the Moorish maiden caused him to turn his eyes in the direction in which her finger pointed his attention, when he beheld Diego and his four followers galloping across the moat. In an instant recovering again his own spear he was in the saddle and with the maiden by his side was urging the two horses at full flight along the defile. For a moment he thought he should not be able to make them pass the dead wolf, but by the aid of the point of his scymetar he sent them madly leaping over the obstacle. Behind him he could hear the clatter of the troops of Diego's horses and the shouts of the Moors. Suddenly they ceased and he knew that they had come up with El Zegris. He was confirmed in this by a loud outcry from the spot following the clang of iron hoof supon the rocks. `Allah, protect us!' cried the maiden. `I fear that even your courage, noble Emir, may not save either thee or me!' `Fear not, lady! Were they twice their number I would not fear them in thy defence. But they will not follow far. In a few rods we shall come to a part of the gorge impracticable for horses. We will leave our horses in the narrow defile which will be so completely blocked up by them that no horsemen can get by or beyond them. We will then make the rest of our way on foot by a path known only to the mountaineers; and thus effectually elude pursuit. Where you cannot walk for the roughness of the way I will carry you safely!'</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XV. THE EXPLANATION. The gorge along which they were rapidly pressing their way, narrowed every moment, until they could only go on one before the other, Alfonzo being last. At length they came to the steep face of a precipice, where the road was only a mere cleft in the rock not two feet wide. Here, by his directions, she alighted, and also dismounting, joined her. Just before them was a sort of natural path over the cliff, accessible only for persons on foot. `We will here leave our horses to be taken by their owners, lady,' said Alfonzo, `and go the rest of the distance on foot. I hear our pursuers. Let us make no delay. Your safety is every thing to me. I am willing they should say `Alfonzo flies the Moors!' so that thereby I secure your safety!' She pressed his hand in silence, but her eyes beaming with gratitude to her unknown deliverer were more eloquent than words. He aided her to climb the steep path, and in a few minutes they had left the gorge far below them and were crossing the open mountain-top in the vicinity of the cell of the hermit.— They heard no more of their pursuers, though they listened as they paused to rest for a moment. In a little while, Alfonzo came in sight of his herd and his noble wolf-dog walking round and round them, guarding them. Upon seeing his master, the intelligent animal came bounding towards him and leaped upon his shoulder as if he would embrace him, while his eyes beamed welcome and joy at seeing him. Alfonzo examined the wound in his neck made by his spear when he launched it at the wolf, and was gratified to find that it was not worth noticing and would heal without attention. From the situation, in which he found his flock all collected in a close crowd together, he knew that his trusty dog had compelled them to remain so, not permitting them either to feed or move from the spot till his master should return.— The poor gazelles seemed startled at the sight of the Moorish costume through which Ban had instantly recognised his master, and looked startled when he approached them. `You see, lady, that my herd are afraid of me, though if I wore my own costume they would be trotting up to lick my hands with every sign of joy!' `Your herd, Emir?'[1] [1] A title; and used also as a term of respect, like sir or senior. `Yes, lady, I am a gazelle herds-man!' he answered. `Sit here upon this mosscovered stone over-shadowed by this olive tree, and where I often have st to 4 watch my gazelles, and I will tell thee who I am and how I came to rescue thee, for we have had little time to speak with each other since we left the fort of El Zegris.' The maiden gladly availed herself of the umbrageous seat to which he conducted her, a pleasant and elevated yet secluded nook in the cliff commanding a wild mountain prospect; and in the distance, between two peaks, was a glimpse of the golden Guadalquivir. She could not withhold her eyes from the noble and youthful countenance of the young man who had saved her so gallantly from the hand of the marauding El Zegris. Every time he turned towards her as he was discoursing, he saw her dark, rich eyes drop hurriedly beneath his glance, while the deep glow of the rose would heighten the charming tint of her cheek. `I am, maiden,' he said to her, `but a poor gazelle-keeper. You see my flock which is all my worldly wealth, and its care my only ambition.' `How is it, then, noble Emir, that I see you in the dress of one of my countrymen?' she asked, with curiosity and surprise. `I know, by thy speech, thou art a Christian, and I know that the mountaineers are all men of Spain; how is it that I see you wearing the turban of a Moslem?' `I assumed this costume, lady, to save thee. No other motive would have induced me to adopt the garb of the Infidel.' `But I am an infidel as you term the children of Islam,' answered the maiden, with something between reproach and regret. `Didn't you know this at the first? If so, what am I to thee that thou, a Christian, the enemy of my race and faith, shouldst save me as thou hast so nobly done?' `Listen to me, lady, and all shall be made known to thee, for here you are safe. The Zegri dare not come on this side of the cliff without their leader, who will hardly ever lead them again. In my duty, as a herdsman, not many days ago, I was seated watching my herd upon yonder rocky summit, which overlooks the valley of the river and Cordova, and also looks down upon a tower called the Emir's tower.' `My father's home and mine!' she ex claimed with delight, clapping her hands with joyful surprise, and gratitude sparkled in her glorious oriental eyes. `Oh, am I so near! I knew not where I was, but being with thee, though I know thee not, and know thou art a Christian, I felt secure. Wilt thou take me to my father, Ben Osmin?' As soon as thou art rested! Thou shalt see him ere night!' `Thanks, noble Christian.' `I am rewarded in having rescued thee. Do not thank me, nor look upon me with such grateful eyes, lady, or I shall forget that thou art a believer in Mahomet; I in the cross. I know not if I ought to linger here a moment, or hold any discourse with thee.' `Nay, if I, a Moorish maid, fear thee not, noble Christian, THOU shouldst have little scruple!' she answered, with an arch, yet modest look, that made his heart, Cupid's faithful time-piece, go faster in his bosom, than he ever knew it to throb before. Her eyes seemed to dart arrows of fire into his soul. He dared not look up again to meet her gaze, but said with downcast eyes— `I will hasten with what I have to say. While I was seated upon the rock, looking down upon the tower, I saw you appear in the court-yard, and proceed to water some flowers.' `Saw me, noble Christian.' `Thyself,' he answered with a smile at her look of perplexed surprise. `The cliff is at least a thousand feet above the tower. Thou couldst scarcely tell me from one of thy gazelles.' `If I had only seen thy eyes, maiden, I might not,' he answered with ready gallantry, and at the speech she dropped her fringed lids to her small Morocco slippered feet, and blushed with evident pleasure at so delicate a compliment. `But I saw thee and yet could not distinguish a feature. I beheld only a grace of motion that since then, now thou hast been nigher to me is proved could only have been thine own. But not by motion, or form, or feature do I know that thou art the same. By thy voice I recognize thee, lady. I heard thee sing. Heaven only has such music as floated from that garden bower to my ravished ears. I listened entranced. It seemed to awaken or create a new and delightful sense in my soul. You sang I know not how long. It might have been a few minutes—it might have been hours for all that I gave count of the passing time. But I will not speak in such terms, for I see that it surprises thee to hear me, and I know that I do wrong in suffering the recollection to animate my words as they do; but my heart will speak, lady.' The maiden listened like a startled fawn at some unusual sound, to his impassioned words, for words of passion they were though he hardly knew it, and swiftly would he have fled from her in fear, had he understood that it was love that was burning in his bosom for the Infidel maiden, and kindling his lips with such warm eloquence. `I have offended you, maiden.' he said, observing her look constantly down. `No,' she answered in a voice as musical as silver; and raised her eyes to his face. It was only for an instant; but the look thrilled to his very being. Lightning is not more vivid than was this brief glance, nor is the tremulous dew-drop softer in the moon-beam. The young mountaineer was not aware of his danger, or being aware yielded with delightful madness to the spell that he felt she had cast about his heart. `Maiden,' he continued, taking her passive hand, and how could the fair Moorish girl refuse to give her hand into his whose courage and love had saved her from a fate so dreaded as to be the bride of El Zegris? `Maiden, I will not speak to thee of the hours by day in which thy voice echoed in the deep of my soul, and the dreams at night in which I heard it mingling with every sound as the star beams are woven with the darkness. I knew thou wert of the Moorish race, and would have banished thee from my thoughts. But in vain. In vain I confessed my sin and did bitter penance for my crime.' `Alas! is it so great a crime for a Christian to think of a Moorish maiden?' she said with a sigh of the profoundest sincerity; for she felt that her heart already was her preserver's. I fear it is, lady,' he said sadly. `And I resolved no more to think of thee; for I said, if the notes of her voice have so moved me, how shall I withstand the glance of her eye, should we ever meet.' Here the heautiful girl lifted suddenly her almond-shaped lids, fringed with midnight rays, and darted upon him a glance that would have made captive the heart even of the holy father Godfrey, had he been exposed as was Alfonzo his protege, to their influence. `I did not expect to meet you, lady, for we mountaineers have little fellowship with or love for the Moors that settle about us in the valley. But to-day, being in pursuit of a wolf, I came upon the stronghold into which you were brought by El Zegris, and entered it without being opposed. It contained but one Moor, whom I was compelled to drag with me into a room on suddenly hearing the returning footsteps of the Chief; for it was too late to retreat by the gate. I saw you brought in and heard all that El Zegris said to you. When I heard your voice, I recognized it to be the same that I had heard floating up from the garden at the foot of the Emir's tower. Instantly I resolved to rescue you, for I saw how you hated the proposed union. I could have escaped by a loop-hole in the wall, but I would not leave you in the power of El Zegris.' `Noble and brave Christian!' `I waited until El Zegris rode forth and his followers, save one, slept. I then disguised myself in the habiliments of the Moor, whom I held prisoner in the apartment where I was, and sallied out boldly, saddled the horses, and then slew the sentry as he nodded on his post. My next act was to kill the Ethiopian who guarded your door—to burst it open and place you before me on the saddle, and fight my way out. The rest you know, lady. And now having explained to you all, we will once more resume our way; for I doubt not you are desirous of seeing your father.' `How shall I thank you, my noble benefactor!' cried the Moorish maid, almost kneeling in her gratitude at his feet. `I forget thou art an unbeliever in my remembrance of what thou hast done for me. My father will bless thee also!' `I ask no return: I have done only my duty. El Zegris has been punished, and thou art made happy—this is enough for me. I heard him call thee Genilla.' `It is my name, noble youth. Now, wilt thou tell me thine?' she asked with sweet grace. `Alfonzo.' `The Destroyer!' she cried, starting aside with amazement not unmixed with fear. `I thought thou knewest me not, as I called my name aloud when I rode from the fortress.' `I was too much alarmed and confused to hear. The sounds of clashing steel, the whizzing of lances, and the shouts of the robbers, were all that I heard. Art thou then the brave and heroic mountaineer? Yet why should I ask—I should have known thee by thy deeds!' `Thou wilt hate me too; for if thou hast heard of me, thou hast also heard I love not thy people—the oppressors of my native land.' `Yet from this time I will look upon thee, Alfonzo, and think of thee, noble Alfonzo, only as the friend of the Moor! He who could risk his life to save a Moorish maiden, cannot be the foe of her people.' Alfonzo slowly shook his head, made no reply, and calling to his dog to guide the gazelles down the mountain, led the way with the maiden.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XVI. THE PARTING. We have now brought our story up to the time when Alfonzo had his first interview with the beautiful Genilla. We have seen how rapidly love intoxicated his heart as he discoursed with the beautiful Genilla. We have seen how rapidly love intoxicated his heart as he discoursed with her upon the moss-seat beneath the wild olive tree on the mountain. We shall now briefly allude to the events that followed, and then proceed with the regular narrative which we broke off after the parting of the lovers at the tower and as Alfonzo was returning to his home where he had left his father watching over the wounded young Emir. Alfonzo, then, having conducted the Moorish maiden to his homble abode, where he quickly exchanged his Moorish dress for one more suited to his faith and race, presented the lovely Moor to his sister, relating her history. The fair Xariffa, who had less strong prejudice than her brother, received the rescued maiden with sisterly affection; and when, after an hour's rest with her, she left under Alfonzo's charge to return to her father's house, she presented her with a little silver cross, and sweetly told her that when she was in sorrow or trouble if she would pray to him who died upon a cross, she would find protection and peace. Genilla accepted the cross rather as a token of affection than a badge of faith, and promised she would try its efficacy. Alfonzo then took her once more under his charge and safely conducted her to the tower, where she found that Ben Osmin had just returned from Cordova, whither he had been to get troops to pursue the robbers, who had carried off his daughter; but could obtain none, each of the ruling Emirs fearing to let any of his own followers go, as a revolution was daily, if not hourly, expected to break out. He, therefore, returned in despair just before the arrival in safety of his lost daughter. He embraced her with tears, and was nearly beside himself with joy, crying and laughing by turns. Alfonzo had not delayed a moment after leaving her, as he was anxious to return and head an expedition against the tower, and besides he did not wish to hear the Moor's thanks for the service done his daughter. From that time he became a frequent visitor at the cottage of the Moor, till old Ben Osmin thought it best to ask the young lover if he intended to become a Moslem; if so, he might still visit Genilla; but if not, he must cease coming to the Emir's tower. `I owe you my child's happiness and safety,' he said to him, `but, by the beard of the Prophet! I cannot have her saved from El Zegris to be lost again to a Christian. The Zegris is at least half Moor, while thou hast not a drop of the true blood in thy veins. I thank thee, Christian, for the rescue of my child; but I cannot consent that you should have her as the price of it. So let there be peace between us and the shadow of thy body cast no more across my threshold!' Alfonzo bowed in quiet submission to the will of the Moor. He could not become a Moslem, even for Genilla's love. All the while the maiden stood by in silence, her hands folded upon her breast, as if she perfectly submitted to her father's decree. She well knew that the young mountaineer would not change his religion; therefore she did not ask him. But she also knew that he would not cease to love her. Without a word he left the presence of the old Moor; but he had caught the dark glance of the maiden as he passed out and translated into, `Wait by the tower and I will speak with thee, Alfonso.' So he waited at the southern angle of the tower, and in three minutes Genilla was by his side. Her eyes were sparkling with moisture and her cheek was pale; that emotion which she suppressed and concealed in the presence of her father now showed itself before the lover. `Alfonzo, we cannot part thus!' `No, Genilla! Yet I feel that your father has instructed me in my duty. I ought not to see you again. Day by day I have been self-condemned for loving thee! But in vain have I tried to break the sweet spell with which thou hast bound my heart to thee! I would say in the morning, I will see Genilla no more, and yet evening would find me by thy side! I have felt miserable because I loved thee, and ye more wretched when I thought that I must one day give thee up, or perish!' `It need not be, Alfonzo!' `What wilt thou become a Christian?' cried Afonzo, with joy. `No, no, I said not so. I cannot become a Christian, but for me thou wilt become a follower of the Prophet of God!' `I, a Mahommadoun!' he cried, shrinking from her in holy horror. `I a Moslem believer? Never, never, Genilla,! I love thee with all my being, but I detest thy faith!' `We will not darken this hour of parting by more words like these, Alfonzo. I love thee, because gratitude lies at the bottom of my love; and I cannot cease to love thee whatever thou art. We will speak of this subject no more. But we are not to part now forever!' `I hope I shall see you again, yet I sin in saying so!' `Sin! Sin for thee to love me! Oh, what a severe faith is thine, Alfonzo!' she said, softly and reproachfully. `It is no sin for me to love thee as I do!' `If the Holy Church knew that I loved an Infidel maiden, as I love thee Genilla, it would cast me forth from its bosom.' `Would to Allah it would; then the fold of Islam would open its gate to receive thee!' `I would rather perish with the curse of the Church upon my head than embrace thy false faith!' `We were to speak no more on this theme,' she said, smiling. `I forgive thy words for thy sake. I have not come to meet thee, Alfonzo, to make thee a Mussleman, but to tell thee that I and my father are of two minds. He would have thee stay away, I would have thee come! Wilt thou come secretly to see me! For thou art the star of my life, now! To love thee and to be conscious that I am beloved by thee is all of existence that I feel! Thy love is the breath of my being. Wilt thou come!' `Yes, Genilla! I would refuse to see thee again, for it is better to lose thee in this world than to lose my soul in the next; but I cannot say so. I must come.' And he did come often and secretly, till their hearts grew together as one heart, and save in faith they were one. Yet Alfonzo loved with a heavy conscience. He kept the secret of his love from the hermit, and this made him unhappy; for to an ingenuous mind concealment is hateful. He felt he was doing wrong in loving the Moorish maiden; but he hoped to convert her to Christianity, and with this weak defence of his conduct he let the current of his peep passions drive him onward. On her part she felf none of those compunctious visitings of conscience for loving Alfonzo. He had won her heart by the service he had done her. Christian, or Moor, or Pagan, even, she could not cease to love him. And she too, it was the sweet hope of her young heart, she too hoped by the talisman of love to allure him to the faith of Islam, which to her was the Faith of Faiths. So the current of their loves ran smoothly on, disturbed only by brief discussions upon their respective faiths. Their meetings were secret, and not less delightful that they were so. It rendered Genilla dearer to Alfonzo in that her sweet society was not to be purchased without danger. We have now got back to our lover as he is proceeding homeward from the Emir's tower after his last visit, that visit in which he had found the hermit closeted with Ben Osmin, and on which he learned Genilla's determination to accompany her father the next morning into Cordova. He walked slowly along through the dark cork-tree forest, his way at intervals being lighted up by a patch of moonlight laying like shining water-pools upon the green sward. He was busily occupied as he paced along, in thinking about his love for Genilla, and her contemplated visit to Cordova. He did not like to have her go, so beautiful and unskilful in the ways of the world as he knew her to be; and he feared that—in a word he began to feel jealous. He was very much afraid—if he had dared to confess his feelings to himself—that some one of the handsome and dashing Saracen cavaliers with whom Cordova swarmed, might see her and captivate her susceptible heart, and steal her affections away from himself. This idea, once fairly got into the head of the young mountain lover, troubled him vastly. Half a dozen times he was on the eve of turning back and insisting with all a lover's eloquence that she should not go; but he was every time deterred from this lest she should suspect his motives; and to be thought to be jealous is exceedingly annoying to a lover when he is jealous. `I will let her go,' he at length said; `if some gay Saracen knight falls in love with her and she returns his passion, as she may—for I am but a poor mountaineer and a Christian—it will be best for me! In loving her as I do, I feel I am risking my soul's salvation. But I should be miserable not to love her! So beautiful, so gentle—she was made for me to love her! Oh, Genilla! if thou wert only a Christian!' He sighed and walked on rapidly, as if he would run from his thoughts. Suddenly he heard the tramp of horses, and voices ahead of him. He drew aside, and upon seeing the party come near, he knew that it was a Moorish cavalcade of hunters, for there were hounds in leach, and two falconers with birds riding in front. `It will be a sad tale to bear back to Cordova,' said one of the horsemen, a richly dressed Saracen, who seemed to be the chief of the party, addressing a young man in a green turban who rode by his side. `It will indeed,' answered the other; `but I trust that he has found his way down the mountain by some other path. It is more than likely we shall find him at the palace when we arrive.' `Allah grant it! But on my soul be it! I would rather it had been myself lost or perished than he; and at this time, too, when our faction hoped so much from him. But I hope the best! God is great—and what is to be will be!' `It is barely possible he may have found shelter in the hut of some mountaineer,' said another of those who rode slowly along in front. `That would be as fatal to his life as if he had fallen from a precipice,' responded the first speaker. `It was folly in him going out to hunt on the Sierras, and being there, rash for him to separate himself from us. But I have done my best. We will return to Cordova, and if he be not there before us—which Allah bring to pass!—I will head a fresh party in the morning and scour the mountain.' The horsemen by this time had passed some distance the spot where Alfonzo stood unseen. Their conversation at once brought to his recollection his wounded guest, whom he had left two hours before under the uncertain protection of his father, Gaspar, the Wolf-slayer; and whom he had forgotten in his thoughts about Genilla. He now knew that his guest was the leader of the party which had passed, and that, having given up the search, they had been collected together by their lieutenant, and were returning to Cordova full of sorrow at their loss. His first impulse was to follow them, and relieve their anxiety by informing them where the young Emir—as he doubtless was—was lying. But the reflection how dangerous it might prove to introduce a lawless Moorish party into the quiet hamlet, checked this purpose in his mind as soon as it was formed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XVII. THE HERDSMAN'S CABIN. Alfonzo did not, however, suffer his generous impulse to subside in his bosom without giving it at least some vent. He watched until the cavalcade had entirely past, save a single Moorish slave who rode a donkey some way in the rear, laden with tent equipage. He came out from behind the tree where he had placed himself, and laying his hand upon the hempen bridle of the ass, he said to the surprised Moor, `Ride forward and tell thy master that his chief is safe, and in three days will be in Cordova! Say to him that he need not search for him, as he will not find him; but in three days he will behold him in Cordova.' Having thus spoken, he left the slave as suddenly as he had appeared before him. The Moor, as soon as he could recover from his surprise, galloped forward, and Alfonzo could hear him shouting, `Yallah, yal-il-lah!' to the troop before him; `Yallah, the glorious Emir is found!' Alfonzo heard the commotion that followed this loud out-cry of the slave, and the trampling of the horses as their riders turned back to question the slave, reached his ears. He did not wait, however, for the Moor to tell his story; but, striking off into the forest, was soon out of danger of being overtaken by the pursuing hunters, who, upon hearing the intelligence, proceeded to search the forest for the informant. At length, Alfonzo could hear their chief wind a recall upon his bugle; and, a little while afterwards, as he ascended the first steps of the mountain side towards the hamlet, could see a mile distant, in an opening of the forest, the steel arms of the party once more in column, galloping over the plain towards the city. `They will now wait patiently for their chief,' said Alfonzo, as he climbed the path by the side of the cataract; `and by the end of the three days, I trust he will be well, as father Godfrey has said. The hamlet is safe from their marauding visit; and Xariffa from their free admiration.' He soon reached the summit of the rocking table over which the cataract tumbled like wreathed clouds of silver in the bright moonlight, and in a few moments afterwards he was in front of his hut. All the way through the forest, as he had come, he had been expecting to overtake the hermit; and as the cavalcade of Moors had not fallen in with him, the result of which would have been to make him their prisoner, he began to suspect that he had not returned to the mountain; but had, perhaps, gone on foot towards the city; but wherefore, unless to meet the Infidel Ben Osmin there the next day, he could not divine. But that he would venture there, he could hardly believe; for, much as the Saracen conquerors hated the Christians as a nation, they despised the priests, and never let slip an occasion of doing them a mischief. He now entered the hut softly, and not hearing any noise, he approached the couch where, three hours before, he had left the wounded Moor asleep under the influence of the soporific ointment which the hermit had rubbed into his wound. There, buried in deep sleep, the youthful Saracen lay as he had left him. His handsome features were less false than before, and his breathing was more natural. One jewelled hand lay beneath his cheek and partly concealed by his dark hair. His long eye-lashes lay in an arch of dark curving lines upon his cheek. Beautiful as he was, yet his features were manly and noble, and seemed to bear the impress of mingled courage and gentleness. As Alfonzo gazed upon him, he saw his nether lip move and twitch uneasily, and at times nervously curve itself into an expression of exceeding pride and ferocity. He recollected seeing the same expression upon his countenance when he first beheld him advancing towards him in the mountain path and haughtily commanding him and the hermit to stand aside for him. `The soul may be brave and the spirit gentle; but that look, which sleep has betrayed, shows that his heart is bad.— Noble and beautiful as he is, from this hour, I could rather fear than trust him. The sooner he recovers his strength, and is on his way to Cordova, the better I shall feel.' `Ha, boy! Hast thou come back? What is the hour o' the night?' This voice came from Gaspar, whom Alfonzo saw lying at full length upon a wolf's hide, at the head of the couch.— He had fallen asleep with his forehead upon his boar-spear, and the voice of the young man raised him to a sense of his duty. `It is near the mid hour of night, father. Has he waked yet?' `Not while I have kept awake; but, by the mass! by the feeling about my eyes, I think I have been sleeping. He's safe, though!' added the wolf-hunter.— `We shall yet have our bout together for his jewels and gold—the Holy Virgin permitting it!' he added, crossing his bearded chest with the point of his spear. `Hast thou seen the holy father?' asked Alfonzo, looking round the large, gloomy apartment of the cabin. `No, not since he left here at the first o' the evening. He is no doubt by this hour at his midnight vigils. What do you want with him, boy?' `Nothing, father. Where is my sister? Has she been in the room to-night?' `I have not seen her. She sleeps in her room as a maiden ought at this hour.' `You can also go to your couch, father. I will watch by our guest.' `Can I trust thee, boy?' `Dost thou think I covet the Moors gew-gaws? No, no, father; I am not yet a robber even of a Moor.' `Nor am I, by the mass! Yet will I fight him fairly for these so soon as father Godfrey pronounces him a well man. Call me at the dawn. I have business on hand. I would first get the hide o' the wolf he says he has wounded. He will ne'er ask for it, and if he should, he will not get it. At least the wolves of the mountains belong to us. The Moor has all else of ours—our lands and rivers, our cities and churches, and even our maidens for his harem. By the red rood! he shall leave us the wolves.— Wake me at dawn, boy.' With these words, old Gaspar cast himself again upon the rude pallet from which Alfonzo's entrance had aroused him, and in two minutes he was breathing heavily in deep sleep. Alfonzo gazed instantly from one to the other, and could not but remark the contrast between the physicel strength of muscle and sinew of one, and the graceful eloquence of form of the other. Both alike slept unconscious of each other, unconscious of the gazer. The cabin was silent, save the deep respirations of the wolf-slayer. An iron lamp, fed by rezin from the barlec tree of the mountains, stood upon a wooden shelf near the head of the bed. It cast its dusky light strongly upon the faces of the sleepers, and penetrated faintly to the extremities of the large apartment. There was little to attract the eye in the room. A settle or two of oak placed on either side of a wide fire-place, a rude table, a dresser in one corner containing a few articles of pewter ware; a picture of the Virgin by the side of one lattice, and a huge cross of cork-wood, smoked black over the chimney piece, completed the furnishing of the herdsman's chief apartment. The floor was paved with flat pieces of stone taken from the brook close at hand, and the hearth was a fragrant as smooth as polished marble. The windows were low, and latticed strongly in diamond-shaped panes, but without glass. There were but two doors in the room; one that opened from without, and another of smaller size that led into an inner room of the cabin. The roof of the hut was open, with its rafters to the eye black and smoked, and garnished with cob-web festoons of a score of years. The cabin was surrounded in part by an enclosure of pickets, in which the goats and gazelles were folded at night. A portion of this fold had a covering of bark, beneath which in cold stormy weather the herd might gather for shelter and mutual warmth. There were hanging about on the walls on the inside of the cabin, the coarse apparel of herdsmen—palm-hats with wide brims, and sandals of cork with white lacings. In one corner stood a bunch or faggot of oaken staves for boar-spears— for Gaspar's hunting-spear had often to be replaced by a new one. There was also a crook and a Moorish lance and sword, and several pieces of Moorish armour—trophies taken by Gaspar in his first battles with the Infidels, a score of years before. There hung also above the mantle-piece the gigantic scymetar which Alfonzo had taken from the Ethiopian he had slain; and dangling from a knob by it was suspended the hilt of the shivered yataghan which he had taken from the severed hand of El Zegris.— There also hung about the cabin many wolf-skins, trophies also of the young mountaineer's courage, and proofs of his faithfulness in protecting his herd from its fiercest foe. Alfonzo gazed a few moments upon the face of the young Moorish prince, and then slowly walked away, and opening the door that led to the inner room, he passed through a little entry and then came to a second door. Here he tapped lightly with the tips of his fingers;—he had to repeat the call, when a hand was heard moving the button within, and a voice, soft and womanly, said— `Is it you, brother?' `Yes, Xariffa; can I come in?' The door opened, and he entered a small white-washed chamber, with a paved floor covered with rushes, little sacred pictures upon the spotless walls, a bed upon a wooden frame—a great luxury in a mountain cabin—upon which was a covering of the whitest linen—relics of Gaspar's once noble style of house-keeping in the palmier days of Spain. There were several little luxuries in the room, all once his wife's, and barely saved as mementoes to the daughter of her noble birth. There was a little stand between two windows, on which was a covering of silver embroidery, faded indeed, but exquisitely wrought. There was also a little oval silver-gilt mirror hanging above it, kept polished by a ball of doe-skin, that was suspended by its side from a silken thread. Upon the table also was a silver cruet for scented waters, curiously embossed, and two or three small rolls of parchment, tied with orange-colored ribbon. These rolls were, one of them a missal of her prayers, another a history of the Virgin, and a third a `Book of the sayings of Christ, from his fourth to his twelfth year, compiled by a learned and devout monk.' There was over the head of the bed a small shelf, on which stood a crucifix of black wood, and from a nail over that hung a small muslin bag containing relics: there was a hair from the eye-brow of the Virgin; a piece of a chip that Jesus had chisselled off in his father's carpenter's shop, when he was a boy; a strand of the whip of small cords, with which our Saviour drove the money changers from the temple; a hair of the tail of the colt that he rode into Jerusulem on; and a thorn of the crown that he wore when he was crucified!!! These were but a portion of the treasures in this sacred bag. It had descended to Xariffa from her mother, and was devoutly reverenced by Gaspar—indeed it was the only thing he did reverence. But the mind of his daughter was too much enlightened to give value to such light things as these relics. She held them sacred, not that she believed them to be what they were represented to be, —but they were sacred as a mother's legacy. Father Godfrey had taught her too faithfully and well for her to mistake superstition for religion. The moon was lighted only by a broad beam of the moon-light that came in at one of the windows; but reflected as it was from the snow-white walls on all sides, there was need of no more light than this afforded. By it the beautiful Andalusian maiden could be seen to be beautiful, dark-eyed, and as graceful as a mountain-sylph. She was scarcely seventeen; wore her rich brown tresses free upon her shapely shoulders—and being now robed in a loose night-dress that, as she let in her brother, she gathered about her form, one hand holding it to her bosom—she seemed to be some lovely statue just warmed into life.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XVIII. THE INFIDEL GUEST. `Thou wert awake, Xariffa,' said the young gazelle-keeper, as he took a seat by the moon-lit window, which looked out upon the sparkling water-fall. `Yes, brother; I cannot sleep when the moon shines so bright,' she said in a sweet voice, that was only equalled by that of Genilla, the Moorish maiden.— `Where have you been? I went out for you a little while since.' `Did you!' he cried with surprise; `and whom saw you?' he asked, as he thought he discovered something like hesitation in her manner. `I found my father asleep by your couch, and upon it lay a stranger—a Moor!' `And did you not before know he was here?' he asked, pointedly. `Teresa, the herd's wife, came in and said you had brought a stranger in, whom you had found on the mountain; but when I would have entered the apartment, my father met me and bade me go to bed, saying I had no business there.' `And yet you went again afterwards,' he said archly. `Yes, brother. Not being able to sleep, I was seated by my window looking at the play of the light upon the cataract, when I heard a commotion in the gazelle-fold. Fearing that a wolf was prewling near, I went to call you; the door was unfastened, and I entered; my father was asleep, and, as I said, I saw the handsome stranger lying upon your bed.' `You saw, then, that he was handsome, Xariffa. `Yes; and he looked so interesting and pale that, if he had not been a Moor, my heart would have felt for him. Still I could not but pray that his soul might not be lost.' `I am glad he saw thee not. Go out no more while he is here—it were dangerous for him to see thee!' Upon hearing her brother say this, Xariffa refrained from saying further— that the young stranger did open his eyes while she was standing looking at him with sympathizing bosom, and that alarmed she had fled back to her own room, and filled with wonder and curiosity to know who he was and all about him. She did not tell her brother this, therefore, nor that it was thinking of the Moor as, much as the glare of the moonlight that made her wakeful. She was seated at her window recalling and dwelling upon his features, when the tap announcing Alfonzo recalled her to herself. `I hope you did not stay long when you discovered him?' said Alfonzo. `No.' `And what happened in the fold?— When was this noise which you heard?' `An hour ago. When I got back to my room all was still; I have heard nothing since, or I should have waked my father.' `Why did you not wake him then?' `For fear he would be displeased at seeing me there, and also for fear I might alarm the stranger.' `I am glad it is no worse. This stranger, Xariffa, is a Moor. I met him just at twilight on the mountain: it was at the meeting of the two paths by the old date tree—you know that there there is a narrow ledge?' `I know it well; it was there you saved me from the wolf, that would otherwise have rent me in pieces, dear brother!' she answered, laying her pretty brown hand in his, and fixing upon his face from her dark Andalusian eyes looks of grateful affection. The moon-beams fell like a veil of transparent silver upon her pure brow, and gave a lustre to her beauty that night and moonlight only can lend. He let his gaze rest upon her lovely face for a moment in tender admiration. He thought how like Genilla were the brow and deeply shaded eyes; and the voice, how some of its tones resembled those of the Moorish maiden;—and he loved Xariffa more for this resemblance to Genilla, and his love for Genilla received new impetus from her likeness to Xariffa. `On that rock where father Godfrey and I were resting, with room but for us two, when this Moor appeared armed with a broken spear, and with a flushed cheek. Upon seeing us his bearing became haughty and he commanded us, calling us Christian dogs, to let him pass.' `Alas, he looks so gentle now as he sleeps?' `For the sake of Genilla —' `For her sake! Hast thou not cast the Moslem girl from thy heart, brother?' she cried, with surprise and an aspect of alarm. `Can I not say for her sake, even if I have done so? Did I not once love her, sister Xariffa? Be assured I shall never hate Genilla,' he said, firmly. `For her sake, I said I resolved not to resist the Moor's fierce demand. So I stood aside, almost hanging over the verge, balanced by a hold upon the trunk of the date tree. But the holy hermit, not recognising the appellation given us, refused to move, and the fiery Moor aimed a blow at his breast; but before I could ward it off, the hand that held the broken spear dropped by his side powerless and he sunk at the feet of the good father insensible and bleeding from a wound which he before said he had got from an encounter with a wild boar or a wolf.' `Father Godfrey at once took pity on him, for his anger extends not to the unfortunate, and bade me raise him up and bear him to the hut. I obeyed. We dressed his wounds and in the molient which de poured upon them was a sleeping power, under which the Moor now lies. The holy father, who is a skilful leech, says that by the third day he will recover and be able to go to his people.' `Dost thou know who he is, brother?' `Thou hast too much curiosity, I fear me, touching him. But thou art discreet, He is a dangerous person for thee to be seen by him. He is a Moor! and that is enough for thee, Xariffa! Thou art safe now in the ignorance of the lawless Saracen that so fair a flower as thou art blooms in the mountain glens; but whether this man be Prince or peasant, he will, if he sees thee, bear the fame of thy beauty to Cordova. From that hour thou art no longer safe here.' `There is no danger to me, brother, from one so noble looking! Prince or peasant! He is not the latter; and may be the former.' `Thou talkest as if thou didst wish it would prove so. What is it matter to thee, sister, whether he be the one or the other. Which wouldst thou most regard a Christian Peasant, or a Saracen Emir.' `The peasant, brother. Why shouldst thou ask me?' `I thought thy words showed a regard for this Moor.' `The Virgin forbid! I pitied but his misfortunes.' Alfonzo said no more. He knew that he, a Christian, madly loved a Moorish maiden and he found that even Xariffa might love a handsome Moorish youth! But then she had no tie of gratitude to bind her to the stranger. He had done her no service to awaken attachment for him in her young and guiIeless bosom. In a word, thought he within himself, she has `no motive,' as I had, for loving. My fears are groundless. She is too pure a pupil of the holy father Godfrey to fix her heart upon an unbeliever. I will see that he does not see her, and there will be no danger from what is past!' `The hour is late for thee to be awake,' he said. `I will go and look into the fold. It may be that a wolf has been abroad! Did you hear Ban give the alarm?' `Yes, he barked violently at the time. But, as I said, all was soon silent again!' `It was perhaps only a false alarm. But I will go out and see. I shall then return to watch with this stranger, who I wish was safe in Cordova. But it is father Godfrey's commands that I extend to him the usages of mountain hospitality until he is well. Ere many hours he will awake, and perhaps he will need a nurse's care.' `I will give it, brother.' `No, no! It would be setting the dove to watch the new-fledged hawk. I will see Teresa Pablo's wife and entrust this duty to her. I shall be in the mountains all day. Wilt thou promise me one thing, Xariffa?' `Whatever thou desirest brother. I can deny nothing to thy request.' `Then go not near him on the morrow. Keep out of his sight with discreet care. I have good reasons for it. Would to the saints he had never been led this way, and thus cast upon me. But if we must harbour the lion, we must take heed that he does us no harm.' `I promise you, brother. The Moor is handsome, but do not fear for my heart,' she said, laughing. `I could never love a Moor, were he an angel.' `I question whether there are many Moors who are angels, or are like to be.' `What; not Genilla! But I ought not to speak to thee of her. Fear not for me. I care not for him, save that I shall pray for his soul.' `Thou hadst best not. It will make thee think of him in thy prayers, when thou shouldst be thinking of the Virgin, and her beloved son. It will do thee no good to pray for this Infidel, sister. Let him alone. Only promise me he shall not see thee.' `This I have already done.' `Then good night. I now go to the fold, and if all is quiet I shall go back to the room where our guest lies, und there watch with him till he wakes. Good night sister. The saints keep thee in their safe keeping.' `And guard thee also, brother,' she answered, as she withdrew her graceful form from the gentle embrace of his fraternal arm. Alfonzo went out to see if all were quiet in the fold. He passed first along a narrow walk by the side of the cabin, and came to a gate-way in a high picketed enclosure, over which a brow of the mountain hung like a roof. It was a close and sheltered covert, and inaccessible to wolves save only from the rock above; from which more than once these fierce beasts had boldly leaped from a height of thirty feet into the midst of the herd. But it was a leap to certain death, for escape being denied them, tbey always were slain after fiercely combatting with Gaspar or Alfonzo. The latter now walked around the fold and found all quiet. Ban the dog came near, and rubbed his head against his side, and seemed unusually alert; but there were no signs of an enemy. The gazelles were all quietly nestled in one corner of the fold, and all wore an air of peace and security. He then left the spot, pausing an instant to gaze upon the dark mountains around him, and casting a glance at the skies in which the moon walked in her brightness, attended by the brightest stars of the night's train. He now re-entered the cabin and approached the couch. The Moor awoke as he came near, or rather raised his eyes and closed them again, murmuring a few words. Alfonzo went near him, when he again raised his eye-lids, and gazed upon him. Allah, give me memory,' he said, where am I? Who art thou?' `Thy host, Moor. Take this. It is a portion left thee by a skilful leech.' The young man took it with looks partly unconscious, and a bewildered air. Who art thou?' he asked again. `Thy friend. Sleep and get strength, for thou hast need of it,' said Alfonzo, who saw that he was yet but partially restored to consciousness. `I have seen a vision. I thought I had been in Paradise. A houri came and bent over me, and told me that I was immortal. But who art thou? What dreary place is this? This is no paradise, for thou art a Christian dog.' `Moor,'—began Alfonzo; but checked the indignant words that leaped to his lips. The next moment the Infidel was buried in profound sleep as before. `He is asleep. How quickly. He was not fully awake. What meant he by that vision. Xariffa is as lovely as the houri of this Mahommedan's paradise. Could he have seen her. The Virgin mother forbid. Yet I feel troubled at his words. I hope he will sleep well, and depart sound at early dawn. I will help him away. I know not why, but I feel a foreboding of evil weighing upon my heart through this man. He shall depart at dawn. if I have to take him again upon my shoulders and thus carry him within a stone's throw of the gate of Cordova.'</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XIX. THE EMIR AND HIS HOSTS. The morning broke upon the sleepers and the watcher. With the first grey light Gaspar shook sleep from him, as if it had been a mantle, and standing up said, as he set aright his gasban and bernash, adjusted his skin-cap upon his locks, sheathed his knife and grasped his wolf spear, `The Moor is sound. Thy father's potion is strong, boy. Didst thou give him the second?' `Yes,' father. He is under its influence.' `I would not value a pair of goats that he were now well again. My fingers itch to handle his jewels. See; he is stirring, and look at the door; yonder comes the hermit in his round cap, and haggard enough he looks. Good morning, holy man. Thy blessing for the day,' and the stout wolf-killer dropped on his knees upon the stone floor of his cabin before the tall form of the hermit, who, at the moment, entered the hut. `Thou hast it, son,' answered the monk, touching him upon the uncovered crown of the head. `Thou dost not ask the same, my son,' said the hermit, fixing his eyes on Alfonzo, who stood aloof. `No, father,' answered the young man, who felt that he did not deserve to ask a blessing at his hand, so long as he loved Genilla so wilfully and madly as he did. `Kneel!' Alfonzo obeyed, but with evident reluctance, conscious of his guilty secret. He received the blessing in silence, and with shame at heart. He rose suddenly, as if his generous soul disdained the hypocrisy of the knee to which he had yielded, when he had felt, that if father Godfrey knew all, he would pronounce a curse instead of a blessing, upon his head. The young Moor now not only looked round upon them with an air of consciousness, but raising himself up on his elbow, he said in good Spanish: `How is it that I am here? You are a Christian, I see. Explain to me, for I can remember nothing, distinctly,' and he fixed his eyes upon the hermit. `Thou hast been wounded, Moor, as thou saidst, by a wolf, and I had thee brought hither under the roof of this honest goat-herd and his son. I dressed thy wounds, and have had as much care taken of thee as if thou wert not a scorner of the holy faith.' `Thanks, thanks; I remember that I saw thee. Thou shalt be remembered. Gold I have, and it shall be given thee. When was this?' `Yesterday.' `It seems longer—as if many days had passed. I am still weak, I find,' he said, as he made an effort to sit up. `You will be better to-morrow. Has he drank the potion, Alfonzo?' asked the hermit. `I gave it to him about two hours after after midnight, father.' `Then he will mend rapidly. But it is needful that thou shouldst remain till thou has strength to walk away.' `I would rather then go now; for I am unable to move far. Hast thou seen any of my people about?' `I met last night, Moor,' answered Alfonzo, `a party of Moorish horse, evidently a hunting party. I heard their chiefs discoursing, and learned from their words that they had lost their leader in the mountains. I supposed that thou must be the person they were so concerned for, and I took occasion to speak to one of the party, and bid him tell their lieutenant that thou wert safe, and would be in Cordova in three days at the farthest, and that they need make no further search for thee.' `Ha! and didst thou not tell them where I was, that they might come for me?' cried the Moor, with a flushed brow and angry eyes. `I did not,' calmly responded the young mountaineer, firmly meeting the Saracen's fiery glance. `I did not care to have a Moorish horde invade the retirement of my mountain home. I thought it better to conduct thee, when thou wert well enough, myself to the walls of Cordova.' `And did the chief let you pass unquestioned?' demanded the irritated young Emir. `It was in the forest I discovered them. I was unseen by them, and so heard their discourse as they rode by; and, after all had ridden on, save a Moorish slave mounted on a pack mule, I stepped out from my concealment and bade him tell his masters the words I have already repeated. He rode forward at once, and in a few moments afterwards the forest resounded with the cries and tramp of pursuit. But I escaped their search, and reached my hut here in safety about midnight. But I have reason to believe that thy followers, if thou art their chief, returned to Cordova.' `Thou deservest death, Christian, for thus withholding the knowledge of my being here!' cried the Saracen, angrily. `Moor!' cried Gaspar, who had been standing by and frowning upon the Infidel in silence; `I would caution thee to be chary of thy speech here. Thou art not in Cordova among thy friends, but in the free mountains among thy enemies. Discreet speech becomes thee.' `Dost thou menace me?' cried the Moor, clenching his hand as if he would grasp a scymetar. `Gaspar,' said the hermit, `worry him not. This treatment of an invalid becomes thee not, especially when he is thy guest. Infidel, thou art wholly in the power of the Christian. But thou shalt not he harmed. I will see that thou art attended to till thy strength is restored, and then send thee safely to Cordova.— But thou must be quiet, and also have full confidence in my skill.' `I can do no otherwise. I will trust thee, leech!' answered the Moor, faintly. `Gaspar, go forth to thy day's duties; and, Alfonzo, remain thou here,' said the monk. The wolf-slayer went out, darkly frowning upon the Saracen, who had fallen back exhausted upon his coarse pillow. Father Godfrey examined and dressed his wound, and gave him a drink of some healing mixture; and, darkening the room, went forth with Alfonzo, leaving him to sleep. `Father,' said Alfonzo, as they stood without, `I like not the longer presence of this wolf in my fold!' `It will be but a day or two. I and four men will make him a litter and bear him away, and leave him at the first Moor's dwelling on the plain.' `It might endanger his life. He wants quiet, my son. I know the virtues of the medicine I have given him. It will invigorate him rapidly. He must not be removed; and, besides, it would endanger thee and thy men. The Moors thou wouldst go amongst might quarrel with thee and do thee a mischief.' `Not coming on such an errand?' `Thou hadst best not trust to them.— Why can he not share the hospitality of thy roof? He has gold, and will repay thee?' `I would not touch the Infidel's gold for such a thing, father. But—I will tell thee freely. Thou knowest my sister Xariffa is very fair.' `No Infidel maid can compare with her; and she is as good as she is comely.' `I fear that if this firey young Saracen lays eyes upon her, he will covet her. The very thought kindles my cheek.' `The maiden would not look upon a Moor with favor, Alfonzo.' `But if the Moor looks upon her with favor, he will, perhaps, wish to possess her. Is there not at this moment many a beautiful Spanish girl an inmate of the harems of the Moslem invader? It will be no new thing. If this prince fancies her, he will strive to possess her; got no Andalusian maid is safe in her father's house from the licentious power of these accursed conquerors of Christendom. The quiet of our hamlet would be disturbed with the tramp of Moorish feet, and the Blood of my friends and I would flow in the defence of our homes.' `I see that thou art wise, and bast judicious forsight. I can anticipate all horrors that you have named, my son. I would hasten, therefore, this guest away by night. The potion he hath now, taken will keep him asleep till past noon. He will then awake stronger, and by the aid of a litter can be taken to the house of Ben Osmin.' `Not there, father!' cried Alfonzo, quickly. `Why not? There is a daughter of his race to nurse him; and the Moorish maidens are famed for their skill in medicine. He can there remain till his friends come for him.' `No, no, father. It is too near us. If he remove at all, it must be to Cordova. Canst thou not give him a strong draught when he wakes that will lend him two or three hours' strength to enable him to reach Cardova?' `I know a powerful stimulant will do this, son.' `Then administer it, father.' `I will do so. Xariffa must not be perilled by his presence here longer than is needful. I trust the maiden hath not been seen by him.' `No, I hope not, father. She has seen him but he slept.' `Advise her to keep her room till he has departed; or instead of a blessing to the hamlet, her beauty will bring a curse upon it. The Moor must not see her.' `Whither goest thou now, father?' `To my cell, for a time. I shall return soon after noon, and when he awakes, will administer to him that which will endue him with false strength for a few hours; but it will be at the expense of greater weakness afterwards.' `If he die it were better, than that he should see and desire my beautiful sister for his harem. I know, arid all men know, that every fair maiden of Andalusia is looked upon by the Moor as his own; and I would not wish to have a party come hither with the intent to bear away Xariffa to Cordova to the Seraglio of this fierce Emir; for I well know the Infidel race. He would not hesitate to repay my hospitality by rapine and the sword. I will let my bird out, father, and go up the mountain with thee. Hast thou broken thy fast, for here I have in my pouch bread and dried meat enough for me and thee.' `I Thank thee, my son. I will eat a little while thou art letting out the gazelles. Has Gaspar gone to the hills?' `I saw him as I came out of the door already upon the path going up the gorge.' `The gazelle-keeper opened the gate of his fold, led them to water by the brook side and then turned them into the hill path up which Ban guided them. Alfonzo having asked of the hermit if there was no danger of the Moor's waking before noon, attended him up the steep path-way towards his cell, intending by mid-day to leave his flock with Ban and a herd-boy of one of his neighbours and return to look after the Moor, resolved not to leave him until he saw him far on his way out of the hamlet. His anxiety for the safety of Xariffia was well founded; not that the maiden would be likely to look favorably upon an Infldel, however handsome and attractive, but the Saracen had added to his conquest of Andalusia a claim upon its fairest maidens to fill his harem. A daughter's beauty had in hundreds of instances lost the father his head or the brother his life. The Seraglios of Cordova were tenanted only by Andalusian females, torn by the scymetar of the Saracen from the sacred shelter of their homes; and daily these things were done. Reason, therefore, had the young mountaineer to tremble for his sister if the young Emir should once behold her.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XX. THE DIAMOND. We now return to the cabin of the herdsman and watch the progress of events therein after the departure of Gaspar in search of the wolf which the Moor had slain, and of Alfonzo and the hermit to the mountain. The Saracen still lay as they had left him buried in deep repose induced by the medicinal draught which he had taken from the hands of the monk. He had taken it with an air of mingled trust and suspicion, but being weak and his mind a little confused and irresolute, he had drank it off in silence. Offered by the hand of Gaspar he would have rejected it; but there was something in the venerable aspect of the hermit that led him to believe, or at least hope that he intended him good and not evil. After the departure of the three men the door opened from the inner room and an old brown-visaged female stole softly in. It was Teresa the wife of Pablo the hireling. She was dressed in a dark blue gown of coarse material, looped up at the side to her girdle; and upon her black locks, sprinkled with grey, she wore a red cotton cap with lappets over the cars, and tied beneath her skinny throat. She was full fifty, tawny as an Indian, and yet with an appearance of having once possessed youthful beauty; for her figure was still symmetrical and her dark eyes were bright and in themselves handsome. She held in her hand her rosary, at the ring upon which was appended a little cross. This woman had been commanded by Alfonzo to watch his guest, and also to keep silence, should he wake, touching the presence in the house of the fair Xariffa. All this the dame promised; and after having passed a few minutes in the room with the maiden, to assist her in making her neat rustic toilet, she proceeded, armed with her rosary, to the post assigned her. The old nurse did not like to be left alone in a room with an Infidel, even though he were asleep. She had heard strange and marvellous tales of Moorish necromancy; and it was her religious belief, that every Saracen was a son of Sathanas. She, therefore, left ajar the door, so that, in case she should see any evil spirits appear about the bed of the unbeliever, she could secure for herself a prompt escape from the scene of danger. She now counted her rosary, and muttering an ave at every bead, took courage and walked towards the couch of wolf-skins on which the stranger lay, with a bag of heather for a pillow. The room had been darkened by the hermit, but light enough stole in through one of the windows to enable her to have a good view of the patient's features. Teresa had seen many a Moor at a distance, and wide awake with scymetars in their hands; but she was then too much frightened to look at them with attention;—but a Moor asleep and unarmed, was comparatively harmless, and she resolved to have a good look at him. The gloom of the large room did not please her at all; it looked too much as if the dark corners might hide scores or two of little imps of Eblis; so she approached the lattice and put back the old baragan of Gaspar's with which it was temporarily curtained, and so let the broad, cheerful sun-light into the apartment and across the person of the Moor. The sight of the sun-beams gave Teresa more confidence, for she knew that evil beings feared the light of day. She now went close to the couch of the sleeper, and gazed upon him with mingled curiosity and awe. `Ave Maria! but he is a proper youth. How handsome his nose is; and then he has a mouth just like a baby's, only it has a moustache on it, which only makes it the manlier! The blessed Virgin keep my soul! but he is for all the world like any Christian. See his dark curling hair and eye-brows, as even as the new moon. His hands!—Jesu Maria!—they are as delicate as Signora Xariffa's; and how they sparkle with rings! That large stone must be a diamond at the least; it is like white fire blazing. How much I wonder did it cost? What a pity for a Moor to have such handsome jewels; and such silks to dress in, and velvet bands on his wrists. I never in my born days saw a diamond shine afore! I've heard the folk say they give light in the dark: I'd like to know if that's true. He sleeps terrible sound—if I could just slip it off for a minute, I'd take it into the closet and try it. I would like to see if the story they tell about it is true—it looks as if it would come off easy.' Teresa, therefore, softly approximated her thumb and finger to the ring—a brilliant diamond that sparkled on his little finger. The finger was exposed to her touch, and the ring looked as if it bound it loosely, as though loss of blood had relaxed the muscles and contracted the size of the finger. She, who a few moments before had approached the couch only with her rosary in her hand, and with many fears, impelled by female curiosity, was now bending over the unconscious Infidel and softly slipping the ring from his finger. `How easy it came off,' she said with congratulation; `if he had waked he would have taken my head off as easy. These Moors think nothing of taking folk's heads off they say; but I hav'nt disturbed him, he is as sound as a mole. Now I'll try it in the cupboard and see if it shines in the dark; I'll not keep it three minutes, and then put it brick again.— But it wouldn't be a sin or theft, being he is a Moor, for me to keep it and not give it back to him at all, only for the fuss and swirl he'd make about it. So I'll put it on again when I've done with it, though I'm half a mind to keep it altogether.' With these words the nurse crept across the room, and opening a narrow left that led behind the dresser into a sort of a closet, she drew the door to after her and disappeared. Whether there any virtue in the ring, which went out of the Moor on its being separated from his finger, and of the loss of which he was suddenly conscious, is a question that cannot be satifactorily answered; but, certain it is, that she had no sooner closed the door behind her than he turned himself upon his couch and then opened his eyes and looked wildly about him. His looks showed a consciousness of knowing where he was; still he was not wholly roused. He seemed making efforts to awake and throw off the artificial sleep which had been imposed upon him by the drug which the hermit had administered to him. But he failed, and was sinking to sleep again when he instinctively sought for his ring upon his finger. When he found that it was gone, he again threw open his eyes and moved his lips, as if making an effort to give words to his surprise. At this moment his eyes fell upon the door of the closet, being cautiously re-opened by the old nurse. She had satisfied herself that the diamond shone in the dark, but as for answering the purpose of a candle, thought she, one candle was worth ten such diamonds. Instantly, upon seeing the door open so mysteriously, the young Moor closed in part his eyes; but closely watched from underneath the lashes the appearance of the intruder. His sense of danger tended greatly to quicken his intellect into consciousness; and, by the time dame Teresa had got out of the pantry and closed and buttoned the door behind her, he was observing silently and keenly all her motions. Fear and suspicion were more potent than any reactive power in his drug, and the potent spell of the monk's medicine was dissolved and null. Old Teresa, with the diamond in her hand, stood looking towards the bed and evidently deliberating whether she ought to return it to the unbeliever or not. She had certain vague ideas in her old head that a small diamond was of more value than much gold, and she thought that it was no more than right that she would keep it from the Moor, who, thought she, had no doubt got it by robbery. `He shall not have it again,' she at length said very positively. `At least I will take it in and show it to Signora. It is no sin to spoil the Egyptians, and they say these Moors came from Egypt. I think it would be more wicked to give it back to him again than to keep it. But I will show it to Signora. She would like to see it shining in the dark. If she says I must give it back, I will; but when I talk to her a little, I know she will keep it.' With this resolution the old dame, without taking another look at her patient, went out through the door which led to the apartment occupied by Xariffa. She found the maiden engaged in weaving with two hand shuttles a piece of netting for the head. She looked up on seeing her enter, and said, with a smile, `How is it, Teresa, you come away so soon from your patient? I hope he has not waked up!' 'No, Signora, he sleeps for all the world just like a babe a month old,' answered the crone. `He is the sweetest youth for a Moor that ever woman laid eyes on. It is good for some eyes to have a good look of his pretty face—.Only that he is a Hommadoun, I should never wish to see a properer young man.' `I know he is very handsome, Teresa; and I believe, too, that he is as wicked as he is handsome.' `He can't be!' `I have seen him. I fear him. Perhaps it is because I know him to be a Saracen; but noble looking as he is, there is something in his features that is unpleasant. But what is that thou hast there?' `Don't be angry, Signora, for he is only a son of Sathanas, and if I had robbed and murdered him outright, it would have been doing God service.' `Let me see what it is. Open thy hand. What! a ring?' `A diamond, nothing less; and shines in the dark like a glow-worm. It would take a rosary of 'em to make a light as bright as a rezin taper; but they are very pretty, and then don't burn out, which is a great saving, if one only had one big enough.' `Where did you get this, woman?' asked Xariffa, with angry surprise. `I just slipped it off the Hommadoun's little finger. He was sound, and is never the wiser.' `Robbed him?' `No, Xariffa. I heard diamonds shined in the dark; so I took it off as I saw it was on loose, to carry it into the closet to see.' `And did it?' `Yes, as I said, like a glow-worm.' `And why did you come to me with it? Why did you take it off, or after having been guilty of this folly, why did you not at once replace it!' `What good will it do to him? He has more, and is rich. We are poor, and it is no sin to keep it. He is an Egyptian, and we are bound to spoil the Egyptians.' `Take it back at once. Wouldst thou rob a guest of my father's house, woman, and he a wounded youth. If you despise him because he is a Moslem, you should do him good because thou art a Christian. Return quickly, and, without waking him, replace it upon his finger. The Virgin protect me! The Moor!' she cried, rising and retreating with surprise and fear, as she beheld the tall, noble figure of the stranger in the door of her room.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XXI. THE NET-WORKER. The young Moor, on seeing the old Andalusian nurse leave the closet and then glide from the room, suspected that she was the person who had taken his missing diamond. He, therefore resolved to follow-overtake her, and recover it; for it was of inestimable value. His desire to regain possession of it infused into him new strength; and his sleep had also greatly invigorated him. He was able, therefore, to rise with some activity from the couch of wolf-skins, on which he had been so long laying, and taking a scymetar from the wall, one of Alfonzo's trophies, he leaned upon it and hastened after the woman. He advanced cautiously and with a wary glance around him, for he knew not what enemies he might encounter. He passed through the narrow passage, and all at once came upon Teresa and the maiden. He stood still within a step of the door, transfixed with admiring surprise at beholding such beauty in so wild a mountain spot. Xariffa was, at the moment he discovered her, censuring the old woman severely for taking the diamond, and commanding her to return it. Her side-face was turned towards him, although she did not at first see him, thus giving him a good opportunity both to contemplate her charms and to listen to her words. The dark shining hair waving over a brow and shoulders of exquisite womanly beauty; the gazelle-like eyes; the superb bust and shapely hand, he felt had never been equalled. There was a spirit and glance in her eye as she reproved the old nurse, that heightened the glow of her beauty. She was simply attired in a brown bernish, a blue linen sash, confining it at the slender waist, and she wore a green net-cap upon her head, to bind up the tresses. A native elegance, a sweet rustic grace, were embodied in her form, and around her beauty had thrown a charm that captivated and bewildered the youthful Emir. Upon seeing that he was discovered, he stepped forward and said, with Oriental courtesy and flattery— `I thought I had been lost in the mountains; but I find that having discovered a stray houri, that Paradise cannot be far off! Allah has heard my prayer. I behold in the body the angel of my dream!' `Signor,' said Xariffa, blushing at this compliment to her beauty; `I thought you were sleeping—that is, too ill with your wound to walk.' Xariffa said this with hesitation and great confusion, and alarm; for his appearance had completely taken her by surprise. Yet there was in his looks nothing to fear, at least so her heart whispered to her, as she gazed a second time upon him. His noble figure, elegantly attired, though his costume was somowhat disarranged, his handsome, pale features; his large fine eyes, beaming upon her with mingled admiration and passion; the calm repose of his whole attitude, as he leaned for support upon the hilt of the scymetar —all spoke in his favor. Teresa who had seen him at the same time that Xariffa discovered him, had instantly sunk upon her knees and began to tell her beads, and to cry for mercy in the name both of the Virgin and of the mother of Mahomet. The Moor took no further notice of her, more than to point with his hand to the door, and simply to say— `Go!' She gladly sprung to her feet, and fled from his presence. Xariffa called to her to remain, trembling at the thought that she should he alone with the Moor, but Teresa was deaf. `Fear not, Signora! I come not as your foe, but as your guest I am here.— As I slept, the ring you hold in your hand, was taken from my finger. I awoke and saw the woman who has now fled in such terror, quit my room; and I rose to follow her, as I suspected her.— She led me hither! I heard your reproof and your command for her to return it! For this accept my thanks!' `I need them not, Signor Saracen!' answered Xariffa, embarrassed. `Take the ring, sir; I am sorry the nurse took it; but I believe it was more from curiosity to test its quality of emitting light in darkness, than from a desire to rob you of it; yet, upon getting possession of it, her cupidity got the better of her honesty. I pray you forgive her, and receive the diamond.' `No—it is yours, fair Christian maid,' answered the young man, taking it from her to place it upon her finger. `No, no, Signor,' she quickly said, removing it with a shudder. `I cannot take it.' `Thou art too cruel, maiden, to disdain my gift. I owe this courtesy, for I am thy guest.' `My father's and brother's.' `So; these two men are father and brother to thee,' repeated the Moor, as he seated himself upon a settle near the door. `I am still weak and must rest while I talk with thee.' `Hadst thou better not return, Signor, to thy couch. Thy face is pale and—' `Nay, maiden, I shall be better here,' he answered with a smile, bending at the same time his piercing black eyes upon her face. `I shall do better with so fair a leech as thyself, than under the care of the old man who hath dragged me so heavily. I am still heavy with the sleepy power of his potions. What is thy name?' `Xariffa, Signor,' answered the maiden, with blushing confusion at his bold, free inquiry. `But I pray thee, Signor, stay not here. Thou art imprudent.' `To trust myself within the influence of eyes so burning as thine. I grant it. But do not fly me. I shall not let thee pass me to the door. See, my scymetar debars thy passage out. Thou art my-prisoner, sweet bird of the mountain;' he said, as he snugly placed his sword across the open door, pressing the point deep into the wooden post. `Sit down, I pray thee, and resume thy netting. I love to look at fair fingers nimbly plying the shuttle bow. Thou hast both skill and taste. maiden,' he added, taking up a corner of the web which she had been making, and examining the work. `With silk for thy woof, instead of this coarse hempen fibre, it would be a scarf worthy to adorn a Princess. Come and sit here and go on with thy pretty toil.' `Nay, Signor. I implore thee to retire. If my father—my brother—' `Well, what would they do? I honor them in noticing thee, the Christian dogs.' `Moor, thou dost forget that thou owest to them thy life and present hospice. Is it by insult the followers Islam return hospitality. The cheek of the young Emir coloured highly, and although he smiled, he looked as if deeply displeased, and touched by her reproof. `Thou shouldst not have threatened me with thy father and brother,' he answered haughtily. `I did not menace thee; I begged thee to go. They would be sorry—angry to find that thou hadst taken advantage of their absence to over-step the license of a guest to intrude into my private room.' `Private room! Allah be gracious. Thou lookest as if thou wert a princess, and these rough walls a palace. `It is my palace, my lord,' she answered proudly. 'It is my home, lowly though it be.' `It is no fit home, maiden, for beauty like thine to hide itself in. Thy name is Xariffa; a fair flower, but thou art fairer than the flower after which thou art called. Come, go on with thy netting,' and as he spoke he took her hand and would have drawn her to the seat, but she escaped its hold and stood, as before, at the extremity of the apartment looking, both angry and alarmed, while she wondered at the cool audacity and impudence of the young Saracen. `I command thee,' she said with firm displeasure, her fine eyes flashing at the insult of his intrusive presence, I command thee to leave me!' `Maiden, I pray thee forgive me,' he said, suddenly kneeling and assuming an air of deep contrition. `I have but been testing thy spirit and forbearance. I see that thou art as proudly souled as beautiful in body! I will no longer force myself upon your society. I obey, and will leave thee; but I pray thee first let me remain a moment or two for further repose. My wound still troubles me, and I am not so strong as I believed. Allow me to sit here till I recover a little. I will not disturb thee. I will not even look upon thy sunny face. See! I have removed my scymetar from the door, so that thou art free to go or stay! But i thou wilt remain and proceed with thy work and forget me, I will depart. Thou knowest I should not have come hither but for the theft of my ring by the woman who left my room.' `I know it, Signor. I am sorry she was guilty of this.' `I know thou art. I heard thee nobly reprove her. Those few words showed me thy high spirit and honorable feeling. Wilt thou still firmly refuse the ring?' he asked, beaming upon her relenting features looks of tender appeal. `I cannot take it, my lord. It becomes not a maiden to accept so rich a gift from a stranger, much less from an Unbeliever. Ask me no more!' `Be it so. I will press thee no further. To thy pretty task again. There! That is generous! Now I will sit here and watch thee in silence. Thou wilt forget I am here!' `I would rather thou shouldst go, Signor!' answered Xariffa, as she re-seated herself, with a hesitating, timid air, to her task of netting. `Wouldst thou send me away from thee to that dark old room, to be alone ? I shall, each moment, grow better here! The sun of thy eyes will warm my blood and —' `No more, Signor. Thou didst pledge thy word to keep silent, if I permitted thee to remain.' `Then thou dost permit it. Thanks!' he said, with looks of delight. `I cannot permit where one will or no!' she answered, with a smile playing about her beautiful mouth as she bit into the thread of her work and then proceeded to knot and weave it. She was not perfectly at her ease in so dangerous a presence; yet she had far more confidence in him than at the outset. Still she felt like a lamb who finds itself unexpectedly the guest of a lion, and finds that it must make the best of his critical situation. There was something in the degagee air of the handsome young Saracen that amused her, and qualified greatly her fear of him. There was also something in his looks, his manner when he spoke to her, in the tones of his voice, that struck her as pleasing.— She knew that he was a very dangerous person, and her brother's warning words came vividly to her mind. But still he did not look so very dangerous. And then he had apologised so handsomely; and removed so pleasantly the scymetar from the door-way! And then sat so quietly and submissively, as if he was resolved by docility to atone for his previous boldness. She, therefore, resumed, timidly indeed, her netting; yet she trembled lest some accident should bring her brother back from the hills before noon; or for fear her father should come suddenly in and find his guest in his lamb's fold. These thoughts troubled her; and what too with the dark eyes of the young Emir fixed upon her, and watching every movement of her trembling fingers, it is not surprising that she dropped almost every third stitch in her web, and made, altogether, in the five minutes space only that she tried to net upon it before him, a very bungling piece of work of it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XXII. THE WOLF-KILLER Xariffa found that she could not command her self-possession sufficiently to accomplish anything at her netting while the dark eyes of the youthful infidel were upon her. She became more and more confused at his presence. As a Christian she felt that it was very wrong to remain a moment in the company of so wicked a person as a Mussleman. Nothing but his manly beauty could have reconciled her to her forced stay in the room.— Suddenly throwing down her work, she rose up and said, between a smile and a frown of real annoyance, `I can do nothing, Signor; I pray you, if you are rested, leave me.' `I obey, maiden,' answered the Moor, with ready reply; `I would not anger thee on my account; I see that my longer remaining will displease thee;—but first tell me if I can hope that one day I shall see thee in Cordova?' `I have never been in the city, Signor. It is too dangerous a place for a Christian maiden.' `Thou hast heard only foolish rumors, brought by the peasants. I assure thee that Cordova is only second to the City of Paradise; it abounds in palaces of marble, in beautiful gardens, in fountains; in noble youths and fair dames; and mirth and music reign joyous there. Thou must come to Cordova.' `When the cross replaces the crescent upon its temples, and a Christian prince sits in its royal palace, instead of the usurping Emirs, I will visit Cordova, Signor!' `Thy words ring, maiden,' said the Moor, with a quick color, and an angry light in his eye, which, however, he instantly subdued. `Thou hast spoken of a day that will never return. The Emirs, indeed, will not long reign, I think, in Cordova; but there will be one Caliph instead.' `And who is he? Have not thy people thrown off allegiance to the great Sultan of the East?' `I speak of no Caliph sent from Damascus, but one among us!' answered the young man proudly. `Thou knowest that now Cordova is governed—since we declared ourselves free from the Caliphate of Syria—by a Council of Emirs.' `And they rule not in concord, I hear, Signor. Daily we look for an outbreak, as the principal Emirs among them aspire to reign alone. I have heard that the young Emir, Abdelasis, the son o the Emir Mahomad, who was slain last year, is the most powerful of these, though he rules not with the Council.' `Then thou hast heard of Abdelasis?' `Only that he is rich and ambitious, and has many friends. My father said that the Council of Emirs feared him more than they did each other.' `Ha! has news of our city matters penetrated even here, maiden?' said the Moor, with surprise on his countenance. `The peasants know more than we ourselves. There has been, within a few days past, some talk of such matters as you speak of, and it may be that Abdelasis may succeed, but it remains to be tried. He is closely watched by the Emirs, since a rumor got out a few days back that he might aspire to the Caliphate; for one resolute man, with a few fast friends, would do more than a score of jealous and quarrelling Emirs, each fearing the other, and, in their disunion, become powerless. I had not believed the movements in the town were so well reported here.' `We take a deep interest in all that passes among our conquerors, Signor. It may be that, by and by, taking advantage of your dissensions, we may regain our city and province!' `By the sword of the Prophet! thou art a bold maiden! thy speech tells! Do all Christian maids feel this interest in their country?' `Else they were unworthy the love of Christian youths, Signor! We all weep and pray daily for our beloved land. Spain has fallen; but she will rise again. The holy hermit, who dressed thy wound, says that this calamity hath befallen the land for its sins. It may be so! We are deeply penitent now, and I trust that Heaven will yet accept our penitence and once more raise up a prince and leader among us.' `By the soul of the Prophet! I did not know such a spirit dwelt in the mountains!' cried the Saracen. `If the sister speaks and feels thus how must the brother and father feel and speak! If the maidens of the conquered land are moved to such eloquence and lofty spirit, how must the men of the country be effected. With such a feeling abroad in the land, Spain is not conquered!' `Thou hast confessed it, Moor. Spain is not conquered. The crescent rules over the soil, but not over the soul of Andalusia.' The more I listen to thee, the more thou pleasest me, for thy very spirit! I have never before beheld a woman like thee. Thou canst think and speak for thyself. Beautiful and wise maiden, listen to me, Moor though I am. I love thee. My heart is taken by thy beauty, but less by thy beauty than thy spirit. For thy sake I would almost become a Christian!' `Thou wouldst never be a Christian, if only for my sake. Christianity receives none but those who come for Christ's sake, and that they may be saved. Thy words displease me, Signor. Yet I would that not only thou but all thy people were true believers and heirs of promises given to thy father Abraham!' `Perhaps, if thou couldst favor my love, maiden, thou mightest teach mel the truth. I could sit at thy feet and listen to thy teachings forever, so that I could have the privilege, as I listened, of gazing up into thy dark eyes.' `Thy speech is blasphemy; for it mingles earthly passion with heavenly love. I cannot hear thee, Signor. In professiug to love me, thou art mocking me. Wilt thou depart, or let me?' `Nay, I will not detain thee! Never was wooer treated so coldly. I could envy the Christian goat-herd on whom thy smile would light! If thou wilt return my love, I swear to thee, by Allah, maiden, that I will become a Christian.' `I wish that thou wert a follower of the Prophet of Nazareth, Signor, but I cannot sacrifice myself to make thee one. I cannot trust to faith pledged by a Moslem oath. Thou mightest deceive me and profess to be a Christian, but I know that none but God can give thee a new heart!' The youthful Moor frowned and seemed to be displeased at her words. There was a treacherous light in his eye that showed he meant to deceive the pure girl; for Moors kept no faith with Christians. `Thou art a pretty preacher, fair Xariffa!' he answered; `but I will not make thee angry by any words for those thou hast given me. I will go and try to forget thee! Farewell!' With these words the young Moor slowly retired, bending upon her looks of mingled reproach and tenderness. As soon as she saw that he had disappeared she raised her eyes from the floor, for she had not looked up to meet his gaze, and with a feeling of relief secured the fastening of her door and resumed her netting. But her fingers were trembling too much for her to accomplish any thing; and her thoughts too much agitated to give her mind to her task. So she threw it aside and rose up and walked the room. She re-called every circumstance of the interview, just terminated. At one moment she condemned at another approved of her conduct. That she felt flattered by his admiration of her beauty is not to be denied, and to be told by so handsome a youth, Infidel though he were, that he loved her disturbed not a little the usual tranquillity of her bosom. She felt that she could never love him under any circumstances, even as a Christian, were he to become one! There was something in his face that was unpleasant, and marred, like a flaw in a diamond, its moral beauty. `I But why should I think about or let my mind dwell for a moment upon him?' she said suddenly. I He is an Infidel, and it becomes not a Christian maiden to think upon an unbeliever. I am happy that he has left me. I feel as if I had escaped from some great peril. Handsome he is; but it is the beauty of a fallen angel. How can the sons of the spirit Sathanas have other than that evil light in the eye which sparkled balefully amid the glory of his glance. Glad, indeed, I am that he has returned to his room before my father and Alfonzo came and discovered him. I tremble at the very idea of such a meeting. My brother would have slain him, had he found him here. But why does my heart so suddenly sink? Is there evil still to come to me from this interview? I pray the Virgin to watch over me. But my brother's words of warning ring in my ears. Yet I am not to blame. He sought my room in pursuit of Teresa—luckless Teresa, who always brings mischief where-ever she goes. Alfonzo cannot censure me. Yet I will keep it from him, and Teresa shall be commanded to preserve silence, which she will gladly do, as the price of secresy about the theft of the diamond. I fear nothing, the more I think upon him. He will go away and forget me, as he said he would. I would that my brother were here, or my father!' `Thou hast thy wish child,' said the voice of Gaspar, as he passed by her window, with the skins of two wolves hanging over his shoulder, and his dress wild and disordered, as if he had been combatting with the animals. `What do you wish for me girl?' he asked kindly but roughly, as his manner was; and as he spoke he leaned upon the sill of the window. `I hear the Moor up, sir.' `Ah, then I am back in time! The hermit's potion was not so potent as he supposed. I found the wolf which he had wounded. It was laying in a crevice of the cliff with the broken spear sticking in his shoulder, and, as you see, had nearly gnawed it up in endeavoring to draw it from the wouud in his broken shoulder-blade. He resisted fiercely, but I slew him, and here is his skln. The other is the hide of a wolf that I followed last night to his lair, and this morning attacked him in it; and after some scratches, as you see, killed him and took his coat from him. They were both of the largest size, and one of them has five old wounds in his hide. The Moor will be glad to see the skin of his enemy. I will take it to him. I am glad he is up, for we will the sooner get rid of him; I ike not these Infidels too well at a distance; much less beneath my own roof. But the father would have it that a Christian ought to show hospitality to his foe, giving me Scripture for it. If the devil made a call upon the good father in his cell, I have no doubt he would treat him civilly with the best he had. But I must see the Moor.' Thus saying, Gaspar left the window and passed round the corner of the cabin and entered the room where the young Saracen was engaged in examining the heavy scymetar which had once belonged to the Ethiopian of El Zegris. Upon seeing Gaspar enter, he stepped back with an attitude of hostile inquiry; for the appearance of the wolf-killer was wild and savage, with his gory skins dripping from his shoulder, his rough mountain costume, and the spears in his hand. But he at once recognized him as his host, though he had before seen him but for a moment, and dropping the point of the scymetar, he gazed upon him with surprise and curiosity.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XXIII. THE QUARREL. The wolf-slayer at first looked at his guest with some show of hostility, seeing him armed with the scymetar of the Ethiopian; but a second glance showed him that he was only examining it; he therefore dropped the point of his spear, and said as he entered, `I hardly knew whether to meet thee with words or steel, sir Moor. I am glad thou art well up again. There is great virtue in the monk's medicaments, as I know well, having had to call on him many a time to heal a hurt from a wolf's fang or claws. How fares it with thee?' `I feel strong again, though I have lost much blood, and shall hardly be myself fully for some day or two; I am well enough to return to Cordova, if thou canst get me a horse, peasant.' `A horse? there is not one owned in the Sierras. You Moors have all the horses; by chance a mule may be found —nothing better.' `Dost thou intend to keep me here?' `No; I shall be right glad when thou art safe in Cordova.' `Then wilt thou go and find on the plain some Moor, and send him hither with a horse for me?' `I can do nothing without father Godfrey. It is now approaching noon, and he will soon be here. I will see what he says: besides, he can give thee something will strengthen thee.' `How camest thou by this scymetar?' `That is not mine—it is Alfonzo's.' `Alfonzo! What, the Destroyer?' `Yes.' `Where is that hero of your Sierras? I have heard much of him—where dwells he?' `Not far off, Signor,' answered Gaspar, who had it on his tongue to answer that he was then in his cabin; but he feared that the Moor might some day hatch mischief against him out of the intelligence; and so he withheld the proud boast of his being his son. `I would give much to behold him. Hast thou seen him?' `Yes.' `What stature is he?' `Tall—even a couple of inches above thy own height, sir Moor: and thou hast a truly knightly bearing of thy own.' `How camest thou by this ponderous sword? Does he wield it?—if so, he is a giant.' `No, he carries only a wolf's spear. He loves no better than I the Saracen weapon; yet he can use it on occasion, as well as I. That scymetar was taken by him from a huge Ethiopian, whom he slew when he maimed El Zegris—hast thou heard of that?' `What man in the valley of Andalusia is ignorant of the exploit? It is a ponderous sword! Dost he know that El Zegris thirsts for his blood?' `Does the robber live?' `Yes, and is captain of a body of rebel Zenetan horse, that lay imposts upon all travellers that cross the Vegas. He will ride this way some day in search of his foe. I would give much to see this Alfonzo;—where is he now?' `Doubtless with his herd upon the hills.' `Is he still a herdsman? a warrior like he?' exclaimed the Moor with surprise. `He takes no merit for his deeds, Signor; he is like all brave men, modest. Spain speaks of him as a hero, while he only regards himself as a humble gazelle-tender.' `He must be an extraordinary man. Whose other armor and arms are these? They are Moorish? `Yes; they were taken from their ownners in fair battle a score of years ago. Thou seest that narrow sword—it was Taric's, the Moorish conqueror!' `Tarics!' exclaimed the Saracen with surprise and admiration, taking it up.— `How came it here?' `I struck it from his hand, and he only was saved by his friends from being slain by me; for I had this foot upon his breast!' `Thou?' `Yes, Moor. Herdsman as you see me now, I am of the best blood in Spain. When Taric invaded our land, I was a noble, at the head of a thousand retainers, whom I led to the field. Heaven ordained that we should be defeated. Since that disastrous day I have been a mountaineer! Still I keep Taric's sword as a trophy!' `Thou shalt no longer have it to beast of, Christian!' answered the Moor. `It is mine!' `Thine, Moor! Give it to me!' `Thou shalt no longer retain the sword of the great Champion of Islam. It is a shame to the children of the Prophet that thou shouldst have it. Ask me no more for it!' `No, I will not ask thee for it, Saracen!' cried Gaspar, throwing down the skins and catching a scymetar from the wall. `I will take it from thee, and with it thy jewels! I am poor and thou art rich, robber! Come, defend thyself?' As Gaspar spoke these fierce words he sprung towards him, his long hair flowing behind, giving him a wild and extremely fierce aspect. The Saracen stepped back and prepared to defend with the scymetar his possession of it, and in another instant their swords would have been clashing in mortal combat, when Alfonzo suddenly stood between them and interposed his person to their hostile swords. The Saracen gazed with surprise upon the noble and commanding air with which the tall mountaineer put them asunder, his shepherd's long bernish falling back from his shoulders like the drapery of a statue. Behind him stood, leaning upon his long staff and surveying the group, the majestic whitebearded figure of the hermit Godfrey. `What means this, Saracen? How is this, father?' demanded Alfonzo with difficulty keeping back the fierce wolf-slayer. `Dost thou see that he has the scymetar of Taric in his grasp?' cried Gaspar. `The holy father's potion hath given him health, and, by the mass! he gets out of his couch to rob me of my trophy. Stand back, Alfonzo! I am to do battle with him for both Taric's sword and his jewels!' `Not so, father!' answered Alfonzo. `The Moor is entitled to my protection. Give up the sword, Saracen! Thou seest thy life is in danger.' The Moor, with a dark frown, slowly hung it upon the stag's horn from which he had taken it, and then stood proudly gazing upon Alfonzo and the monk. `How long hast thou been up, Infidel?' asked the hermit now coming forward as Gaspar drew sullenly back, muttering threats against the Moslem hound, as he termed him. `It is not long. I am glad thou art come, for this fierce peasant would have slain me, knowing I am still weak!' `Thou hast provoked him to anger. But I am glad to see thee well again.— Thy hurt was less deep than I believed.' `Monk, I would go to Cordova at once,' said the Moor in a tone of command. `I asked this peasant for a horse, but he would have me wait for thee. Now wilt thou end thy hospitality by accommodating me.' `We own no horses in the mountain, Moor,' answered father Godfrey mildly; for the tones in which the Moor spoke were fiercely stern; and to such wise men ever respond peacefully. `I will have a mule for thee.' `I will rather walk. How far is it to the highest Moor's dwelling?' At the Emir's tower, half a league hence. But thou wilt not find there Ben Osmin, for doubtless he hath gone to day to Cordova,' answered the hermit. And he has no horse. If thou couldst walk a league, by slow steps, with the aid of this young man, thou wilt reach the Kassah of Ali Hamet, the keeper of the garden of cucumbers. He hath steeds!' `I know the place well. But I cannot well walk. Send thy people to him for a horse! Thou shalt have gold for thy trouble!' `If thou wilt take my arm's aid, Moor I will go with thee,' answered Alfonzo. `I will see thee in safety to the abode of this Ali Hamet!' Alfonzo had not spoken since he had separated from them, and the Moor now looked on his form with admiration. `Art thou a mountaineer?' he asked of him, in that tone of command like one who was in the habit of addressing inferiors. `I am,' quietly answered Alfonzo. `Thou shouldst show thyself in Cordova. Thy form would give thee a good place under the Emir Abdelasis. He likes tall men in his body-guard.' `The Emir must find slaves, not freemen to serve him, Moor!' answered Alfonso. `If thou art strong enough to walk, I am ready to attend thee. Thou shalt lean on my arm, when thy feet fail thee!' `The father can give him a stimulant that will help him,' answered Gaspar, sullenly. `In the Virgin's blessed name give it him, holy father, and get the mountain free of him soon. My hand burns to lay its weight upon the unbeliever!' The Moor frowned vindictively upon Gaspar, and then turning to the monk in whom he seemed to have confidence, he said— `Hast thou a strengthening draught, Christian?' `I will prepare it for thee,' answered father Godfrey. He then filled a cup with water, and took from his leathern case a powder which he placed in the cup. `Drink all of it, Moor. Thou wilt find an hour's hard travel of it! It will bring thee to the gates of Cordova.— Thou wilt scarce need the aid of the young man here; still he shall go with thee to protect thee against any of the goatherdsmen that may cross thy path!' `I need no protection against the base herds,' answered the young man with that bold courage which seemed to be a prominent feature of his character. `Yet he shall go with thee! It is our duty, having given thee shelter to see that our hospitality be carried out! Our Prophet Christ teaches us to love our enemies, and if they ask a cup of cold water to give it to them! So have we done to thee, Moor! Now, depart in peace!' The Saracen having taken off the draught, seemed in a moment or two afterwards to be revived by it. His eye caught the brilliancy of health, his colour became clearer, and his whole bearing like a man who has suddenly invested himself with strength as with a garment. He strode proudly towards the door, and said with haughty courtesy— `Thanks, Christians, for the shelter of thy roof! If thou wilt show me the path down into the valley, fair sir, I can then go forward alone!' This last sentence was addressed to Alfonso. `Go with him my son!' said father Godfrey. `He is too overbearing for me to like him well enough to be his companion,' answered Alfonzo, `But I heed him not. I will go with him.' If I went with him, it would be to lighten him of his jewels,' said Gaspar in an under tone, `and perhaps he will find a guide far more of the way than he bargains for. I will follow on at a distance; and when Alfonzo leaves him, I will join him again, and we will then finish our little affair just now interrupted!' The Moor, preceded by Alfonzo, armed with his wolf-spear, which he never went without, left the cabin and took his way down the cliff-side towards the valley. Ere they were fairly out of sight, Gaspar followed, leaving the hermit resting in the hut.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XXIV. THE MOORISH HORSEMEN The path down the side of the cataract was precipitous and the Moor in his descent found it difficult to maintain his footing, especially where the spray from the bounding torrent had rendered the rocks slippery, More than once he was compelled to lay his grasp upon Alfonzo to save himself from a plunge headlong down the precipice, which the sure-footed young gazelle-keeper trode with perfect, safety. At length they reached the foot of the rocks and struck into the forest path that led directly across the beautiful plain in the direction of Cordova. Upon getting a first glimpse of the minorets of the city from the path, the Moor stopped and exclaimed with delight, `Allah be praised. I am once more in sight of the temples of the true faith! How far is it to Cordova, Christian?' he asked, as Alfonzo walked on before him. `Two leagues,' answered the mountaineer. `It is nearly two miles from this to the first Moorish abode. If thou keepest on direct,' he added as he came to a meeting of two roads, `thou wilt not fail to find it.' `What, art thou going back?' asked the Moor. `The road is plain before thee?' `Yet I would rather thou shouldest go with me a little farther; for I care not to fall in with any of the herdsmen. Here is gold.' `They never come into the valley. But I will go on with thee a little farther, Moor. Put up thy gold, I do this from hospitality not for reward. We are poor, —we are mountaineers, but we are not so poor as to take Moorish gold. Thou and thine are my county's foes; but I war not against one of thy race who calls for my hospitality, as has been the case with thee. `So thou wouldst not hesitate to have attacked me, hadst thou encountered me well.' `Not unless thou hadst done me a present wrong. Christians meet Moors daily, and yet there is no fighting between them, save when the former would resent a wrong.' `And the time will yet come when they will not dare even to resent a wrong. There is too much liberty given thee and thy people. Were I Caliph I would make bondsmen of the mountaineers, as well as of the inhabitants of the towns.' `Thou art not Caliph, and so we are free, proud Moor,' answered Alfonzo, with a scornful curl of his lip. `The mountaineer is not so easily enslaved. Dost thou recollect that fifteen years ago, when one of the Caliphs would have made us bondsmen, how many of his servants lost their lives in the defiles of the Sierras! He found us then unconquerable, and so wouldst thou. We are born free, and to God only are we servants. Art thou an Emir, for I know thou art a Moor of rank?' `I am a private citizen of Cordova,' answered the Saracen, who did not care to make known his rank and name, when it might, as he feared, be fatal to him; for it will be seen he was no friend to the Spaniard; but rather, of all their foes, the bitterest, as well as the most rich and powerful. `What is thy name?' `I fear not to speak it, though thou fearest to give thine own—I am Alfonzo, the goat-herd.' `The Destroyer?' cried the Saracen, who now recalled to mind the Ethiop's scymetar, which he had found in the hut. `Art thou the Alfonzo who cut off the hand of the Zegris?' he added, stopping full in the path, and fixing his gaze upon him, as he waited his reply. `I am Moor,' responded the young mountaineer quietly, walking on as before. `Then I have my wish, for I this day told that fierce peasant who would have attacked me, that I would give much to behold thee.' `Thou seest but a freeman, Moor.— The sight, I know, is rare in Cordova to infidel eyes; but thou wilt find many in the mountains.' The Saracen remained standing still, and surveying the mountaineer wilh curiosity and admiration. `So! Thou art the brave man I have heard so much of!' he at length said. `I am glad we have met, or rather that I knew who thou wert before we parted. I believe thou art no friend to the Saracen!' `No. I look upon the Saracen as the enemy of God and of Christian nations. Thy people have now the power in the land, but it will not be forever. The crescent that now so proudly glitters above the cross must be thrown down.— Heaven may have punished Spain for her sins; but its wrath will yet be poured out upon the wicked children of the Prophet, whose iniquities cry aloud to it for its judgment.' `Thou art a bold speaker, peasant!' answered the Moor, reminded by his words of Xariffa's ringing speech. `It is such men as thyself that keep Spain in commotion.' `Would there were more of them, Saracen,' answered Alfonzo. `But this is no time for us to speak of Spain's wrongs and thy oppression. I have conducted thee now as far as I intended. From this spot thou seest the palm-tree of Ali Hamet. It will be a guide from which thou canst not stray.' `If thou wilt go on with me farther, I will give thee a purse of gold.' `No gold! I will go on if thou art a coward. No herdsmen of the hills will find thee here, Sir Moor. The Saracen would have resented the imputation of cowardice; but he had a motive stronger than pride actuating his purposes. He resolved, if it were possible, to get the celebrated mountaineer into his hands. But he could not do it singly. Alfonzo the Destroyer was too formidable an opponent for one or two or many Moors to overcome, if aware of treachery. He therefore wished to beguile him onward to the house of Ali Hamet. He hoped there to be able to make him a captive; and through him to bring the proud maiden, his sister, whom he had seen and talked with in the mountain cabin, till he became deeply impassioned with her beauty,—to bring the beautiful Xariffa at his feet. He, moreover, felt desirous of having in his hands so powerful an enemy of the Moor, who might yet become as formidable to the Infidels as he had been te the robbers of the mountain-wilds. He therefore said, `I am not a coward, brave Alfonzo, in my own city; but, by the hand of the Prophet! I like not much these gloomy woods. If some half score of Christian peasants should meet me alone, my courage would hardly save me.' `I need not go farther with thee! for yonder comes galloping a party of Moorish horse; doubtless some of thy own troop coming in search of thee!' The Moor looked up and beheld about half a mile off a party of horsemen whom by their turbans and white costume he knew to be Saracens. As they came rapidly nearer, he cried out with joy that he distinguished his own banner in advance. `I congratulate you, Moor,' said Alfonzo. `I will now return, and hereafter when thou findest a sick or wounded Christian in need of hospitality, remember the kind treatment thou hast had at the hands of Alfonzo, the herdsman's son.' `Stay. I wonld make thee a costly gift,' said the Moor. `No; I do not care to trust myself with thy people. Fare thee well, Moor.' With this parting salutation, Alfonzo turned to hasten into the narrow footpath to avoid the cavalcade, which consisted of at least eighteen horsemen, glittering in gold and silks and precious stones, and formidable with steel. `They shall not harm thee. I will see that thou art rewarded by them rather than injured. They will hail thee as my deliverer when they are told what thou hast done for me.' Alfonzo knew that it was dangerous for a Christian to trust a Moor; yet he believed that his guest would prove faithful to his word. He, therefore, stood boldly; for the horsemen came on so fast that, without fairly fleeing with speed of foot, he could not readily escape them should they pursue. So he remained, resolved to confide in the honor of the Moor. The next instant the gorgeously arrayed troop came close at hand, and the leader reining up on recognising his chief, leaped from his horse and, approaching him, shouted, `Allah be praised! my lord Abdelasis is safe!' `Allah il Allah! God is great!' shouted his troop, on beholding the young Emir. `We rejoice to see you, my lord,' said the lieutenant, embracing and kissing him. `We heard that thou wert safe in some of the mountain cabins, and I have come out on purpose to search for thee thoroughly. Thy absence so suddenly on the Sierras yesterday has filled us all with grief and alarm for your fate.— Every search was made for you. But you look pale!' `I was drawn away from you in pursuit of a monstrous wolf; I was not aware how far I pursued. I at length came up with him and wounded him in a fierce combat; but he tore my side with his paw, and I found shelter in the cabin of a mountaineer.' `Who is this Christian?' `Thy prisoner, Osmen. Seize and bind him!' cried the treacherous Saracen, as he saw four of the horsemen were within five feet of the young mountaineer. Scarcely had he spoken when Alfonzo, amazed, sprung backward, and presented his spear to defend himself; Osmen, the lieutenant of the Moors, leaped towards him, and Alfonzo struck his scymetar to the ground with a single blow, and still retreated; the rest pressed upon him fiercely. `Let him not escape for your lives! He is Alfonzo the Destroyer!' shouted the false Moor. `Down with him—but slay him not.' No sooner had the four Moors heard this well-known name, than, as if by one impulse, they drew back, as if a chasm had opened before them. The dreaded name, instead of inspiring them with valor, intimidated them. They were afraid to attempt, alone, to arrest so formidable an opponent: they waited for their companions to come to their aid, and then to overwhelm him by the power of numbers. In the mean while, Alfonzo steadily retreated towards the forest, facing his foes. Seeing this, the treacherous Abdelasis leaped into one of the saddles, and seizing a scymetar galloped towards him. Alfonzo received the horse upon the point of his spear, the weapon entering deep into his chest; the animal reared and fell dead, and Abdelasis rolled over upon the ground. He was saved from instant death from his own scymetar, which Alfonzo had grasped, by the interposition of his followers; who, seeing heir chief down, rode on with fierce cries to attack the formidable mountaineer. Alfonzo would have been surrounded and cut down, valiantly as he fought in defence of his life and liberty, when a loud cry from the forest close at hand startled the Moors. `Down with the Saracen! death to the Moor! ho, to the rescue!' Alfonzo, to his great surprise, recognised the stern voice of Gaspar. The Moors, believing they were about to be assailed by a superior force, gave back, those on foot regaining their saddles in great haste; and Alfonzo stood alone, as it were, in the midst of his enemies.— When he saw Gaspar approach, he rejoiced to have such good aid, but was surprised to see him coming towards him alone; for he thought, as the Saracens had done, that he had men with him. `I am alone, my boy, but I will defend or die with you. Two Christians to sixteen Moors is large odds, but let us have stout hearts, and trust in the blessed Saints, and we will get clear of them.' The Moors, who had quickly placed themselves in order of battle to receive the expected attack, on seeing but one person, now looked to Abdelasis for their orders. This prince had mounted Osmen's horse, and taken a sword from one of his followers. He instantly recognised in the new comer his old foe—he burned to attack and punish him, and also to take captive the young mountaineer, who had thus far so successfully resisted the efforts made to take him prisoner.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER. XXV. THE REIGN OF THE EMIRS. Gaspar, upon coming up, ranged himself by the side of Alfonzo, and said, `Now, let us walk backward slowly, and face them, my boy. We shall soon reach the covert of the wood, when they will have to dismount to attack us. To stand and fight with so many would be folly rather than courage. Now for it. Here comes my friend of the jewels at full charge. The Saracen leader spurred alone towards his foes, with his scymetar raised to cut dow the wolf-slayer, as he should ride over him. But Gaspar quicker, than thought, caught the scymetar on the staff of his wolf-spear, and turned it aside. The horse and rider dashed past him, and at the same moment came up Osmen at the head of the whole troop. The two brave mountaineers were forced back to the edge of the wood, Alfonzo keeping his assailants at bay with his spear, while Gaspar, wielding the heavy staff of his pike, like a club, swung it in a circle around him, keeping a clear space between him and the horses. The shouts and cries of the Moors filled the air, and the clangor of arms echoed and re-echoed through the forest. The two mountaineers fought in silence, and with the calm resolution of men who feel that their lives depend on their own courage, and strength. At length they reached the wood covert, where the horses could not follow them, and bounding away deep into the forest they left their pursuers far behind them. The Emir Abdelasis followed them on foot a short distance, when Alfonzo, seeing it, turned back, at which he retreated, though not without cursing him, at the same time loudly giving his people orders to surround the covert and endeavor to cut off their retreat to the mountain. `Heaven has saved me from thy treachery, false Moor,' cried Alfonzo. `Thou hast shown us Christians how to trust a Mussulman. From this hour look upon Alfonzo the Destroyer as thy relentless foe.' `And take the same challenge, Moor, from Gaspar, the wolf-slayer!' shouted the stout herdsman, as the plume of the Saracen's turban was disappearing beyond the foliage of the copse. The two brave patriots then hastened away rapidly through the well-known paths of the wood, and while they heard the Moorish horsemen vainly riding hither and thither in search of them, the angry voice of their chief heard above the tramp of their steeds, they left them far behind, and in a little while regained the foot of the cliff of the cataract. There they paused and listened. The Moor could no longer be seen or heard, and far and wide the cork-wood forest lay buried in the repose of the sunny afternoon. `They have given it up, and thought it best to go back to Cordova,' said Gaspar as he stopped and leaned his chin upon the end of his pike. `You have made a good escape from the false rogues, boy. It is well I was at hand. Yet I did not help you much, for you seemed to be able to do your own fighting, many as they were. But I never saw a man harder pushed than you were.' `Well, I will tell you the truth, since good hath come of it: after you departed I resolved to follow you, and when you should quit the Moor, join him myself, and give him a chance of defending his jewels and his life; and so I kept you in sight.' `By the mass, I thought you would never leave him until you got to the gates of Cordova.' `The treacherous Saracen led me on by pretending fear of any parties of mountaineers. But his apparent timidity I now see was treachery. He meant to have betrayed me to Ali Hamet, if he had not met the party of horse.' `I saw you stop and talk, and then discovered the Moorish horsemen coming, even before you did; for I was higher up on the road. I then crept forward to see what would be the issue of the meeting to you, for I saw that you lingered. I then trembled for you, Alfonzo, for I know too well how little a Moor is to be trusted. I was sure you would be betrayed; so I came up to help you; and see ing you set upon, I shouted as if I had a party at my back, and dashed at them.' `Your presence was timely, father. I was hard pressed, and should have been taken prisoner but for your outcry. They fell back and gave me time to recover myself. But for you, I should have now been a captive to the Saracen, on my way to Cordova.' `If they had taken thee, I would have rescued thee with an army of mountaineers. I would have taken thee from the very dungeons of the Algarf!' `I owe my life to thee, father,' answered Alfonzo, grasping his hand and affectionately laying it against his heart. `Then my design to plunder the Saracen has proved a good one for thee. So thou hast no words to say against it! He deserved to be stripped and murdered— the false Moslem hound! My boy, we men of Spain bear too much and too patiently the bonds of these unbelievers.' `I know it, father,' answered the youngman with stern sadness. `I know it, father; and would to God there were a David to arise in Spain to free our nation from the Philistines. But the nobles have fled and wander in other lands, or serve other princes. None remains but the poor man, who cannot leave, or is too insignificant, so think the conquerors, to be troubled. Yet, father, there are seven hundred thousand such men in Spain.— Would to God they had a prince to lead them against the eighty thousand Saracens that enslave them!' `Amen to that, boy. But the spirit of our people is crushed. The children of Spain, with their king slain, are like sheep without a shepherd. Timid and cringing, they strengthen the very chains the hand of the Moslem has laid upon them. Dost thou know that Christian men and women, young men, young maidens are bought and sold in the shambles of Cordova like beasts?' `I have heard it, father,' answered the young man, with a crimsoned cheek and a kindling eye. `Yes; within the last two months they have openly made a slave-market. And men who have been in Cordova tell me that there prowl about parties of slave stealers who carry off the unprotected female or youth, wherever they can do it safely, and barter them in the city to the keepers of the slave bazaars for gold. It is enough to make a Spanish man blush with shame that these things should be so and we suffer it.' `I know it, father. I have thought of all these things and have wished that I had the power in my single arm to redeem Spain. But we can only weep and pray for our enslaved country! There is no spirit in the people. There is no prince to raise the standard of the cross for them to rally around.' `When Taric the conqueror beheaded the king and queen, he did a wise thing, for the stability of his own power, to destroy also the three princes. If one of these had lived and Spain could behold him, lethargic as you think the people are, they would rise as one man and follow him wheresoever be would lead them. The wrongs we have endured in the twenty years of the Moorish sway have made us desire their overthrow, even at the price of our own blood. Spain would fight now, boy, more bravely to recover her soil, and temples and homes, than she fought to defend them. Then she had not felt so bitterly the weight of the Moslem rule as she has since done. She did not have such reason to hate the Moor as she has since done. May God have pity upon us and send us help from Rome or some other Christian power. It is the cause of Christendom to drive out the people of Mahomadoun. We should make pilgrimages to their courts, and on our naked knees implore them to send a Christian Prince to succor us and lift the standard of the Holy Cross up against the accursed crescent. I have never looked on the new moon, which they take for their device, since the battle of Xenil, without feeling it is unlucky to undertake anything before its second quarter. The moon was crescent and shone upon our ranks when we fought the disastrous battle of the Xenil. The Moors fought by its light and conquered. It was and is the Christian's evil star. But we need not stand here and talk of the wrongs of our country, boy. The day is passed that I hoped to see Spain redeemed. But one day, as says father Godfrey, the arm of the Lord will be made bare and the mocker at the cross will come down to the dust. But I shall not live to see it.' With these words, uttered in a desponding tone, Gaspar turned and began to ascend the steep path by the side of the water-fall. `What news have you from Cordova within a day or or two, father?' asked Alfonzo, as he walked by his side. `Nothing. The council of Emirs still rule like so many snarling dogs watching a dead deer. I hope they will soon cut one another's throats. But it matters little to us whether Spain hath twenty or only one ruler, so that the power is Moslem.' `The last rumor that came to me said that the Emirs were daily expected to fight among themselves for the Caliphate. Each one of them had fortified his Seraglio, and went about attended by an armed force, and even met in conclave, like enemies during a truce, holding a council on the battle-field.' `Yes; and this state of things cannot long last. They are so well balanced against each other in point of numbers, that neither dare make the first move. They say, those who go into the markets, and from whom I learn these things, these people say that the most powerful of these is Algezir; not that he has more followers or more gold to buy over adherents, but on account of his indomitable spirit. They all fear him and he despises them all. But prudence keeps him quiet until the suitable time shall arrive for him to act. He will then make a move. But he has an enemy and rival he fears more than he does his fellow Emirs.' `You mean Abdelasis, who has to-day proved himself so treacherous,' said Alfonzo. `I am glad I have seen this rich young Emir, of whom I have heard so much; I am glad, too, that he has shown me his true character; I am resolved, father, that the false Moor—prince though he be—shall pay dearly for his treacherous designs upon me. But these are idle threats! I am powerless: what should a poor herdsman do with menacing vengeance against a powerful prince?' `This Abdelasis is indeed powerful, and he is a powerful rival of the ambitious Emirs;' said Gaspar, as he fastened his spear in the crevice of the rock, and drew himself upon the verge where commenced the level space on which the hamlet was built. `Yes, he is rich; and being the son of a popular Emir, has many friends of his father. It is true he has no authority. and lives, as he told me, simply as a citizen in Cordova;—but his court is like that of a prince, and his retainers outnumber those of any three of the Emirs. They all fear him; and Algezir, men say, feels that he is the only rival who can interpose to defeat his pretensions to the throne. But Abdelasis has remained quiet, outwardly, though all men know he will not continue so for a moment after the Emirs shall break the peace of the city.' `It is my belief he will yet be Caliph of the kingdom,' said Gaspar, as they approached the hut. `The Saints forfend! then Spain would indeed bleed. Young and noble-looking as he is, we know, father, that he has a heart base enough to suggest, and a hand ready enough to carry out any deed of wickedness. God save poor Spain from his rule!'</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XXVI. THE HERDSMAN'S BOARD. The two speakers had now reached the front of their cabin, and Gaspar, saying that he had to look after his goats, turned to leave Alfonzo at the door. `You will go in and get some dinner, father,' he said; `it is two hours past noon.' `That is true!' answered Gaspar, entering the cabin; `I had forgotten that I was as hungry as a bear on a month's fast. Here comes Xariffa with a pitcher of goat's milk in her hand, and the table is set for us, I see. Well, girl, the Moor is on his way to Cordova, and, by the mass! we are well rid of him. Ah! holy father, art thou still honoring my humble roof? Thou shalt eat with me this day, for long abstinence is not good for thy age; fasts are for young, lusty fellows, to mortify the flesh, not for thee. Come, here is a flagon of sour wine: it is the best the Moors have left us, and we must call it Aldana, and believe it so! Here is goat's milk on the board, holy father, if thou likest it better; and I see that the active Xariffa—Heaven bless her!—has placed a loaf for each of us. Come, father, say a grace, and let us fall to!' `Thou art too hospitable for thy purse, son,' answered the monk; `but I will eat with thee gladly; I have need of strength, for I have duties before me.' With these words the hermit drew up to the humble board; and while Alfonzo, Xariffa, and old Gaspar, stood reverently around it, he asked a blessing upon the coarse fare. They then sat down, the three men, while Xariffa walked about the table waiting upon them, filling now Gaspar's brown mug with sour wine, now urging the hermit to take more of the fresh goat's milk, or help himself to more of the loaf, and now filling her brother's cup with fair water. They ate with appetites and enjoyment; and when the first edge of their fasting was taken off, Gaspar proceeded to relate, in his blunt way, the adventures of himself and Alfonzo in the forest. The Monk was amazed at the treachery of the Moor, and Xariffa could hardly refrain from openly expressing her indignation. But she discreetly kept quiet, for fear that she might, by some unadvised expression, betray the fact that the false Saracen had seen and talked with her. She knew that such intelligence would deeply, and with reason, afflict her brother, and that she could scarcely succeed in clearing herself from all blame in the face of the fierce and angry excitement which the knowledge of it would produce. She, therefore, listened in silence, her features expressing to her brother vividly enough her sense of the infamous conduct of their late guest. `I don't know that I ought to be surprised, my children,' said the monk.— `This is the Moor's character. It would have been surprising, had you returned, Alfonzo, and told me you had guided the Saracen till he fell in with a party of his followers in search of him, and that he suffered you to depart in safety.' `By the red mass! I shonld have been surprised too!' responded Gaspar, as he put down from his lips the half-emptied mug, after a long draught. `There is no red mass, my son,' answered the hermit, in a severe tone of reproof. `I have often had occasion to re mind thee that thy oaths are not well chosen, and are too frequent.' `Then, by the mass! I'll swear no more, holy father, save when I come across a Moor; then I will swear. They are always swearing by their Allah and their Prophet's beard, and I am not going to be put down by such hounds, in this matter. Besides, a good oath, sworn in faith, hath a blessing in it!' `Thou mayest swear, if need be, on certain occasions; but see that thou use no more thy favorite adjuration of the red mass. There is no mass but one.' `I thank thee, father; but I have heard Christian knights swear by the red cross!' `That is different, for the cross was indeed reddened by the blood of him who was nailed thereon.' `I see, father! My religious education was something neglected in my youth; and I thank thee for thy teaching. Would it be a sin for a Chrisrian to swear by Allah?' `It would be both a sin and a great evil, my son! Thou shouldst make no use of the words of the Infidel. I know not if it is right to learn and speak their barbaric and unholy tongue so much as we do. Daughter, this bread is very sweet and palatable! I never find such bread in any other house in the Sierras. Thou art an excellent housewife!' `That she is, holy father. Thou canst never throw away praise in giving it to Xariffa. She is a rare maiden for one who has been so many years without a mother! Such a man as I am, father, makes but a poor dame for a girl! But I have done my best, and she is docile, and things come to her hand easily. Alfonzo here has, however, done most for her. She must thank him and not me!' `Nay, father, I owe myself, all that I am, to both of you!' said the pleased Xariffa. `And to the holy father! He hath had the religious teaching. But for him thou wouldst not have known the difference between a red mass and a white one. Thou shouldst thank him also.' `I do, dear father Godfrey,' responded the maiden, smiling gratefully upon the venerable face of her teacher. `I know that I belong to each and all of you; and I ought to be happy to be so loved and protected.' `Yes, thou wilt find protection, daughter, not only from our arms, but those of every youth and old man in the Sierras, for many leagues west and east. They all know thee and love thee. It is no light affection that causes all people to call thee the Star of the Sierras; yet thou art spoken of more by this pretty title by all the young men and maidens, than by thy own christened name. It shows thou art good as well as comely!' `My father always goes on thus praising me when one begins,' said Xariffa, laughing and blushing, as she looked towards the hermit. `He has said none too much, daughter If thou couldst hear Alfonzo discourse of thee thou wouldst not heed thy father's praise.' `I know the boy loves her almost as well as I do.' `As well, father!' cried Alfonzo, `I will have it that I love her quite as well. Who is so dear to me as my sister?' Xariffa thanked him by a sweet look of affection, but at the same time gave him a glance so peculiar that he knew that she would have said, had she put the glance into words, `I know I am dear to thee, brother, but still I believe that Genilla is still more dearly beloved.' The humble meal at length ended, and the two herdsmen rose up, Gaspar to go after his goats, which he had left under the care of Pablo, up the cliff, and Alfonzo to return to the charge of his gazelles, which the faithful Ban had been guarding, as they fed far up the mountain. `I am going up to my cell, and will ascend the pathway with thee, son,' said the hermit. `I am glad I can help thee up, father. I hope you will accept my father's kind invitation, and live with us. Thou art getting too old to climb the mountain.' `Thanks, sons, both of you. But I am yet strong. I have, it is true, been something ill of late; but it was, I doubt not, from too much fasting. I will take more care of my health: as I find I can't endure the vigils and penance I once did.' `It is impossible you should, father,' answered Gaspar. `Now, fare thee well. I go to my work; for I have a nice garden on the cliffs, which I dig in while my goats feed. The soil is as rich as butter. Thou shalt eat garlic and Spanish lentils from it yet.' Thus speaking, Gaspar started off alone taking his way along a path that led through the gorge. Alfonzo and the old man went up the mountain track, the latter refusing the aid of the young man. At length they gained the uplands of the Sierras, and Alfonzo found his gazelles feeding in security under the guardianship of Ban. `I will go on with thee to thy cell, father.' `No. I will not take thee from thy flock. Besides I would sleep awhile when I get there, and thou wouldst be alone.' `You have been abroad much of late, father.' `Yes.' `Did you not go into the valley, last night?' asked Alfonzo, wishing very much to know, if he could draw it from him, the object of his visit to the Emir's Tower.' `How know you this?' asked the hermit quickly. Alfonzo was about frankly to tell the holy father, but he feared to let him know that he himself was also at Ben Osmin's; therefore he said, evasively. `I saw thee go in the direction of the valley. It is dangerous for you to venture far from the mountain, father. The Moors will not even respect thy white hairs.' `I must go and come as my duty calls me, my son,' answered the hermit; and he fixed his eyes keenly upon the quiet face of the young man, to see if there was any reason to suspect that he knew where he had been. `True, father. How clear the atmosphere is here, father. Yonder party of horse is full three miles away over the valley, yet how distinctly we can see them from this height. I should not be surprised if it were the troop commanded by the treacherous Abdelasis. `I cannot see so far, my son; my eyes are, therefore, not pained with the sight of the Moslem banners.' `There is the Moor who lives by yonder tower, at the foot of the Sierra,' continued Alfonzo; `is he a quiet person?' `It is Ben Osmin; and I believe, for a Moor, he is an honest man,' answered the hermit. `Why this question, my son?' `It becomes us to know well who our neighbors are, father, in these troublesome times. We must know who to trust; this Ben Osmin may be a spy of the Emirs.' `No; I believe he lives quietly there with his daughter;—but thou shouldst not think of him, for then thou wilt think of her. Remember thy sin, my son! Turn away thine eyes from temptation. But I wrong thee! I do not fear that thou wouldst ever give thought to an Infidel maiden. Hast thou forgotten this one?' `I hope I shall never be censured by you again, father, on her account.' `I am glad of it, my son; think of thy herds, and thou wilt leave little room for the magic of Moorish women's arts to hurt thee.' Thus speaking, the hermit bade him farewell, and went slowly up the remainder of the path, and was soon afterwards lost to the eye of Alfonzo. In spite of the holy father's caution, the young mountaineer let his eyes wander in the direction of the Emir's tower; and sharply did he gaze down into the court of the cottage, in hope that he should espy the fair form of Genilla, with whom, since he had been her lover, he had often exchanged signals from the cliff,—he waving his shepherd's scarf, and she her snowy veil. But he did not see her, and it suddenly came to his recollection— what the recent stirring events had caused him to forget—that Genilla had doubtless departed that morning with her father, Ben Osmin, to visit Cordova. END OF VOLUME FIRST.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER 1. There is an interval of nearly two days between the events related at the close of the last chapter and those which will form the subject of the present volume. In this interval, however, brief as it was, great changes were effected in the government of the valley of Andalusia, that deeply interested alike Moor and Christian. Before proceeding with the events that followed this change, we will devote a chapter or two to an account of it. When Abdelasis, the false Saracen Prince, who had so basely requited the hospitality of Alfonzo by attempting to deprive him of his liberty, found that pursuit after him through the labyrinths of the forest was in vain, he recalled his troop together and proceeded to return to Cordova. He had not ridden far, silently brooding over his defeat in losing the possession of the daring mountaineer, before he called to his side his confidential officer, Hamet Osmen. `Well, Osmen,' he said, trying to throw off his chagrin by assuming a light air, `we will let this Christian dog go. By and by he will come into my hands!— Just at this time to have captured him would have given me no inconsiderable power; for the mountaineers are strongly attached to him; and the possession of their idol would give me a control over them. At least none of them would have consented to join the Emirs against me, while I held him as hostage!' `And none of them would join the Emirs in any manner, noble Prince,' answered Hamet Osmen; `they love none of our foes too well to favor eithor of them.' `That is true; but still it would have been to my advantage holding so formidable a personage. But this was not my only motive in resolving to arrest him, as you shall by and bye learn from me;— but not now. When did you leave Cordova?' `An hour before noon, my lord. After we missed you on the mountain side we searched for you, and wound our bugles, and left no efforts untried to find you. At length we gave you up for lost; but still I hoped you might have fallen in with some mountaineer, and by means of gold been guided into the valley.' `It was not long after I saw you, and sent you on one path while I took another, to head the wolf, that I met him and gave him battle; but I soon after fainted and heard no bugle. This Alfonzo and a monk, it seems, bore me to a hut, and there dressed my wounds and gave me a sleeping draught. To this I owe my recovery.' `The wonder is, it was not a poison they administered to you, my prince!' cried Osmen, with horror at the idea.— `Allah be praised for your escape! You did well to arrest this peasant, for no doubt he would have poisoned you if he could have done so. But you asked when I left Cordova:—your highness shall hear. As I said, after searching long in vain, and night coming on, I resolved to return to Cordova—hoping that possibly you might have got clear from the mountain, and found your way alone to the city. On our way through the forest, a man suddenly appeared to Abul the pack-mule rider, and told him to say to me not to trouble myself about you— that you were safe in a herdsman's hut in the mountains, and would be in Cordova well within three days. Having said this, the peasant disappeared as suddenly as he had appeared, and Abul galloped forward and gave me the information. Resolved at once to ascertain where you were, I turned back and searched for the man, scouring the forest; but at length I was compelled to give up the hope of finding him, and with reluctance pursued my way to the city, trusting that the intelligence given by the man would prove true. `This man was none other than Alfonzo, the herdsman!' said Abdelasis.— `He said to me that he had met a Moorish troop in the forest, and given precisely the information you have repeated. It would seem that he did not care to have you come in person to his hamlet, with so large a party of followers to carry me away. These mountain Spaniards are very jealous of the invasion of their homes by the footstep of the Moor.' `After reaching Cordova, and not finding you at the Palace, nor hearing of you in any other quarter of the city, I gave up the hope, which so long had cheered me, that I should yet find that you had returned before me. And I had now either to believe the story of the peasant to Abul, the pack-rider, or to suspect the worst.' `I am grateful, Hamet Osmen, for your faithful attachment to me.' `My lord, my life is in your hands!' answered the Moor, bending his neck till his forehead rested upon the saddle-bow. `Thou shalt not be forgotten! Go on and tell me what affairs thou hast left behind thee in Cordova!' `Thou shalt hear, my lord, all in good time; though by Allah, I have no special news, save that the Emir's are ready to draw the scymetar to cut off each other's heads at any moment.— This morning I did not feel easy about your absence, even with the assurance of the unknown mountaineer that you were safe; so I resolved to take a select party and ride to the mountains and once more search for you, especially in the huts of the herdsmen. But Allah blessed me with the sight of my lord, on his way to meet me.' `And now for Cordova. The news thou hast for me! for something must have transpired since I left. How goes it with Algezir?' `He is still in his Seraglio, which has the air of a castle. There was a rumor that he had desired the Council of Emirs to meet him in his Seraglio on some business; but each had refused to attend, fearing treachery when once inside of his walls.' `They know Algezir is not to be trusted. But they are cowards all and weak men. If Allah gives me life for two days more I will stand upon their necks and give Algezir's red-bearded head to the dogs. I know that am strong and that he cannot withstand my power. To-morrow I will lift the standard of the Prophet in the court of my palace, and from the midst of my steel-clad guard of faithful Zenetas proclaim myself Caliph of the kingdom.' `The time is ripe, my lord. If you do not strike soon Algezir will do so. It is impossible Cordova can longer remain torn so many factions.' `Within two days Algezir or Abedelasis reigns Caliph of Spain!' cried the young Emir. `Thank the Prophet, we are now well out of that black forest.— How proudly rise the domes and minarets of the capital above the Guadalquivir; and the crescents that surmount them seem to smile welcome to the new Caliph.' `Long live the Caliph Abdelasis !' shouted Hamet Osmen in his enthusiasm and tossing his spear in the air, he galloped forward again shouting, while the troop, catching up the words, made the air ring again. `That will do, my faithful friends answered Abdelasis. `It is well we are in so lonely a part of the valley, so that that the cry could not reach our foes; for, if it touched their ears, we should hardly be admitted into the gates of the the city. Let it pass now, Osmen; but do not be so rash again. When you see the standard of the Prophet unfolded and tossed upon the winds by my hand, then you may make the name of Abdelasis your battle-cry. But now keep silent.— Let us enter the city in close order and peacefully. The party of horsemen now trotted rapidly forward, passing gardens and las and vineyards, and groves of date and figs, and orchards of oranges, the trees glittering with their golden fruit and by and by reached the shady bank of the beautiful Guadalquivir. Here the road turned to the right and followed the shore, which was a scene of gardens and palaces. Gilded barks were floating upon the tide, and music and laughter came from the snow-white pavilions nestled amid the green foliage on the banks.— All around them was a scene of beauty and life and enjoyment. They met turbaned travellers on ambling horses, followed by laden mules; parties of merchants met them, or were passed, reposing under the trees; slaves were bearing water in jars upon their heads from the river, to irrigate the terraced gardens that adorned the shore; and now and then a wealthy Moorish citizen of Cordova would prance by, followed by a Sedan-chair, borne by Christian slaves, in which, closely shut up from view by silken curtains, rode his wives or daughters. As they approached the gates, there suddenly came to their ears loud cries from the walls. Shouts were borne to them from the streets, with the clang of armor, and far and wide along the battlements rose upon the air the uproar of battle. The gates were all at once filled with terrified citizens, pouring out on foot, old and young, male and female. The travellers and merchants who were approaching the town turned and fled, and repassed the cavalcade in wild terror, crying, `The Emirs are at war! Cordova is in revolution! Algezir aims at the throne! Fly all peaceable men!' and so they rode on to widen as far as possible their distance from the city. The commotion was not witnessed unmoved by Abdelasis. He had no sooner caught the sound of battle raging within than he raised himself in his stirrups and calling upon his followers, he cried, `Now is my time! Forward!' Like a thunderbolt, the Moorish horsemen rolled forward along the dusty road, which each moment became more densely thronged with those who fled from the confusion and warfare within the walls. As they came near the portals, Abdelasis met a young Moor, who dashed up to him with looks of joy, and yet with alarm visible on his face. `Ho, Ibrahim! Whither so fast?— What uproar is this?' cried the Prince. `Allah be praised!' cried the youth. `Is it possible that I find my lord alive?' `Yes, and ready to take advantage of this hour. What is going on in Cordova?' `You shall hear, my lord,' answered the young man, who seemed hardly to realize that the Prince was alive. `You see that your absence was bruited about, and at length this morning flew from lip to lip, that you had been slain by a wolf in the Sierras, while hunting. This report no sooner reached the ears of Algezir, the Emir, an hour ago, than he sent a confidential messenger to ascertain its foundation. The messenger, it seems, returned and confirmed the truth of the report. Thereupon, Algezir has suddenly raised the banner of the Caliphate before the Great Mosque, and proclaimed himself Caliph. He is at this moment at the head of a thousand of his followers, attacking the council of Caliphs, which were assembled in the council chamber of the Seraglio, to endeavor to effect a combination to overthrow the formidable Algezir. At this moment he is assailing the gates of the Palace, and at every corner the followers of the Emir are doing battle with those of Algezir.' `And where are my people? Has any attack been made upon my Palace?' `Not yet, my lord,' answered the young Moor, as he galloped at the side of the Prince, who was all the while pressing forward at the head of his troop.— `Algezir will first overthrow the Emirs, and then invest the palace. But your friends are resolved to defend themselves to the last. They have only need to know that their Prince lives, and to have you place yourself at their head to sally forth, and attack the force of Algezir with success. I was riding to find Osmen and bring him back to the city, to aid us with his skill and courage, when Allah gave me instead, my Prinee.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER II. THE RIVAL EMIRS. The young Emir had listened to the rapid relation of events given by Ibrahim, with the deepest interest, all the while galloping onward to the gates. The populace, who were non-combatants, were crowding out of the portal, each carrying some valuable, and every face expressive of the deepest alarm. Several of the men who were escaping from the scene of battle, recognised Abdelasis at the head of his score of horsemen and shouted his name to those around, and in accents of gratification and welcome. `Allah be praised! Abdelasis lives, and is entering the city! Now the power of the cruel Algezir will fall. Long live Abdelasis, the son of Musa, the Caliph! The mantle of the Prophet descends upon him.' `Long live Priuce Abdelasis!' shouted his followers, uow catching up the cry, and making it ring again, till it resounded into the streets of the city. `All true Moslems, who are for order and just rule, let them follow me this day!' cried the Prince. `Come to my palace and you shall find arms. Let us onward.' With these words the youthful Emir dashed forward, and rode with speed through the arched gate-way, the people crowding close to the pillars on the right and left, to suffer him to pass with his troop. After entering the city, he turned short to the right, to avoid the crowd in the main thoroughfare, and by a narrow and unfrequented street, rode at top speed towards his palace. Suddenly on turning an angle in the street, he came upon a party of the followers of Algezir, pursuing a larger force of the Emirs; for the conclave of Emirs had united their troops to oppose the common foe Algezir. The pursued were fighting but in confusion and panic; while the Algezirs, about thirty in number, press them closely, and with courage.— No sooner did Abdelasis see how affair were going, than he couched his lance and led his men against them, shouting aloud in his own cry— `Il Allah! Allah, Il Allah!' Their appearance was so sudden, and the onset so resistless, that the Algezirs were routed, and compelled in their turn to fly—for the unexpected appearance of Abdelasis, whom every man supposed to be dead, terrified them as if they had seen a spirit. `Pursue them!' cried the Prince, `to the troop of the Emirs, and remember that you owe your safety te Abdelasis! The captain of the Emir's grasped the hand of the Prince, and said, `Long live Prince Abdelasis!' `Can I depend upon you and yours?' asked the Prince, as he returned the pressure of the officer, whom he well knew. `In all that you undertake, my lord answered the Captain; and then taking up the war cry of the youthful Emir, he rallied his men, and led them gallantly up the street, in pursuit of the flying foe.— Abdelasis did not wait to see the result but turning into another street kept on his rapid way towards his seraglio or Palace. He rode through a narrow lane bordered with orange-trees, and came suddenly to a gate that led into a spacious square, on the opposite of which, embowered in noble trees, stood his marble palace. At the gate he found a strong guard drawn up to receive him, for Ibrahim had ridden forward to announce the safe return of the Prince. Abdelsis rode at full speed into the beautiful court of his palace, hailed by the joyful acclamations of his followers, who filled the court and the palace to the number of two thousand armed men. There were amoug them sons of Princes, Viziers, Colonels and Knights of the noblest Moorish blood. They were magnificently arrayed, and seemed to vie with each other, in the magnificence and costliness of their armour, and the beauty of their horses. Upon beholding their chief, the young knights and captains crowded around him and hailed him with acclamations. Abdelasis galloped round the court, showing himself to his people, and receiving their congratulations; and then, reining up near the palace steps, he called his chief officers about him, and said— `My noble friends, Allah has restored me in safety to you. Instead of finding yourselves besieged here by Algezir without a chief, you find me here to lead you forth against him, and prepared to seize the sceptre of the Caliphate. At this moment, the din of battle in the great square of the Mosque reaches our ears, mingled with the sounds of contest in other portions of the city. Algezir, at the head of the flower of his troops, is at this moment attacking the Palace of the Caliphs, where the Emirs have been artfully surprised by him while in Council, and their troops fight at disadvantage without their chiefs. It is my purpose to attack Algezir in the rear, by entering the square through the street Ben Hamel. Osmen, go and bring me the green standard of the Prophet.' While Osmen was gone into the palace, Abdelasis, with skilful generalship, formed his followers—one quarter of whom were cavalry—into columns for attack, and with his trumpeters placed in the van, waited the return of Osmen—who soon came forth from the palace, and kneeling by the stirrup of his chief, presented him with the sacred banner, which had been consecrated on the tomb of the Prophet at Mecca. A profound stillness reigned throughout the vast court of the palace, broken only by the falling of water in the noble fountain that adorned its centre, and by the swelling sounds of the distant warfare, borne to the ears of the impatient warriors upon the breeze. Abdelasis, having received the standard, kissed it with great reverence, and then elevating the staff, unfolded its silken field broadly upon the air before all eyes. He then waved it slowly to and fro, while the armed hosts surrounding him, with one voice, cried— `God is great, and Mahomet is his Prophet!' Again the prince waved the royal standard, and every voice cried— `Long live Prince Abdelasis! Death to his enemies!' `Now, Ibrahim,' said the prince to the handsome Moorish youth who had met him outside the city gate, `take this sacred standard and bear it by my side. Warriors and friends, now let us show this Algezir that there is a Prince in Cordova more powerful than he. I draw my scymetar before all your eyes, and I swear by Allah, that I will not put it out of my hand save to grasp the sceptre of the Caliphate!' These words were received with a shout, and a deafening clang of steel struck against steel. The next moment Abdelasis was galloping forth from the gate of his palace, with Ibrahim on his left, bearing the green banner of the Prophet, and Osmen upon his right; close around him also rode his faithful body-guard of Zenetan horse. Troop after troop of gorgeous cavalry came next, each led by a knightly captain, clad in glittering steel armour, inlaid with silver or gold—fell into column and thundered after him, till four hundred horsemen were in rapid motion into the heart of the city, in the direction of the loud din of contest. The foot soldiers followed at a fast trot, each man armed with a lance and curved sword, and some of the companies carrying likewise bows and a quiver of steel-pointed arrows at their backs. This large army, numbering nearly two thousand men, were soon all in motion through two parallel streets towards the great Mosque. A strong guard for the defence of the palace was left behind, and the gates were closed as soon as the rear of the troops left the court. Abdelasis rode on at full speed, so that only his two friends and his body-guard could keep up with him. Louder and fiercer arose the uproar of battle from the square, as they approached it. The streets were thronged with citizens flying in all directions, now from the scene of battle, now from the terrific advance of Abdelasis and his cavalry. Friend and foe, young and old, were alike ridden over by the prince and his followers, as he dashed forward like a war-eagle on the wing. He had not slackened rein or spoken a word since he issued from the gate of his palace, until he came within about two hundred yards of the entrance of the vast square which had become the sanguinary theatre of the revolution in progress. Here the Prince waved his hand to halt, and leaping from his horse he walked forward a few steps and ascended a flight of steps which led to the corridor, and thence to the flat roof of a house that commanded the scene of conflict. The inmates of the house had fled from it, and he encountered no one but a trembling slave, too decrepid to move.— He soon reached the roof, and before his eyes laid the battle field which he was to charge upon. The square was a vast area in the centre of the city, and save on the side from which the Prince overlooked it, entirely surrounded by noble buildings, palaces, mosques, and Christendom Cathedrals now turned into Mosques. The sides of this magnificent area were lines of columns, corridors, terraces extending for several hundred feet, in the most sumptuous style of Moorish and Gothic architecture. Vast domes rose above stories of marble pillars, and minarets pierced the sky on all sides like a forest of needles.— The Seraglio of the Caliphate or palace royal of Cordova, was directly opposite the eyes of the Prince. This was a beautiful structure of rose-colored marble, ornamented by ranges of pilastres and columns of the purest alabaster; while vaulted roofs and entablatures of carved porphyry increased the splendor of its effect. On the left of it was the Mosque of Omar, the most majestic temple of the Moors in Spain, and on the left rose the imposing towers of the Cathedral, upon the summits of which glittered the crescent. Over all these glorious piles of marble, and porphyry and alabaster, over all this opulence of architecture shone the cloudless afternoon sun, lending a new splendor to the scene. But the eye of the Prince lingered not on these beauties. The roofs of the temples were thronged with armed hosts, the towers and the domes bristled with spears, and from the tall minarets lances glanced downward like lightning, while flights of arrows, from terraces and corridors, darkened the air. The porticoes of the Mosques were alive with warriors, and the piazzas of the Palace were converted into fortresses; and the Emirs could be seen defending them with great valor against the fiercely attacking forces of Algezir. The whole area, vast as it was, was filled with battling parties. Every avenue from the square was a battle ground. On all sides the fierce war raged. The Prince's eye having taken in at a glance the situation of the field, now searched for the Emir Algezir among his people, and at length beheld him seated upon his horse near the statue Taric, in the square, surrounded by his chief officers, and giving orders. The bosom of the Prince burned at the sight, and he waited only to take one more glance at the field, when he descended from the roof, leaped into his saddle, gave one or two directions to Osman, who galloped at the rear, and then waving his sword, he gave the command to his columns to advance into the square at full charge. Side by side with the Prince rode the youth Ibraham, bearing aloft the sacred standard. Already had the news that the forces of Abdelasis were approaching to mingle in the conflict, been received; and as Abdelasis descended from the roof the news reached the ears of Algezir, as he sat in the midst of his aids. `My lord!' cried the bearer of the intelligence; `the troop of Abdelasis have taken horse and are advancing upon us!' `They will easily be beaten back, without their chief,' answered Agezir haughtily. `They have nothing to fight for! Go and meet them, and offer them peace, on condition they acknowledge me as Caliph, and lend me the aid of their swords; otherwise, when I have hanged these Emirs, I shall put them to the sword! Say these words to Hamet Osmen, who doubtless heads them!' The messenger had hardly gone from his presence to meet the coming forces which, from the place where Algezir stood, were not yet visible, when another horseman spurred up, and cried, `My lord, Abdelasis himself is alive, and heads his own followers!' `It is false!' cried the Emir changing countenance. `Who told thee this?' `I saw him with my own eyes, my lord! He rides at the head of his troops, who fill all the street, and above his head floats the standard of the Prophet!'</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER III. THE YOUTHFUL CALIPH. When Algezir heard this news, he looked as if he felt that his power and his victory were about to be taken from him; for his troops were everywhere getting the better of the Emirs' forces, and three of the Emirs had been slain. He remained for a moment as if stunned by the intelligence. At length he said, as if he doubted the truth of it, `Show me this Abdelasis, and I will believe it. It may be some of his knights who have assumed his armor and energies.' `He wears no armor, my lord. His face is open to all eyes. Behold!' `Look! he comes! The Abdelases charge upon us, my lord!' shouted his officers, riding hither and thither to rally their forces to meet him as he came prancing into the square with trumpets sounding, his banners flaunting, and with the thunder of the trampling of his cavalry. Algezir beheld and recognised his foe, and then his amazement and hesitation gave place to courage. His voice was heard high above the uproar of battle, and placing himself at the head of some of his best troops, he pressed forward to meet the charge of the Prince, who was advancing upon him at the head of his horse, with lances in rest and shouting the battle-cry, `Allah, il Allah! Down with the pale Emir!' The two parties met in full career, and a score of riders at the head of each column bit the dust, overthrown in the fierce shock of the encounter. Abdelasis and Algezir met scymetar to scymetar, and while their followers were fiercely fighting around them, they fought hand to hand with desperate valor. Algezir at length, being pressed hard by the Prince, would have been slain but for his friends, who separated the combatants. The tide of battle rolled onward. Everywhere was heard the war-cry of Abdelasis. Everywhere he was seen with the sacred banner held above his head by the brave Ibrahim. His followers kept their eye on this and fought their way towards it. Unable to withstand the fierce energy of the Abdelases, who came pouring into the square in fresh squadrons, both foot and horse, the forces of Algezir gave way. In vain their leader called upon them to stand for the day might yet be his. They were panic-stricken. The sudden appearance of Abdelasis had filled their minds with fear and consternation; for on the presumption of his death, had they raised the standard of Algezir. The troops, too, that had been attacking the palace of the Emirs, had been called by their Chief's trumpet to aid in repelling Abdelasis; and seeing this, the Emirs, who had been ready to surrender the palace, took courage, and sallying forth, charged them from the portals. Thus placed between two foes, Algezir's forces were broken and fled from the scene where they were so lately victors, pursued along the streets by the now conquering partisans of the Emirs. Algezir, as he was escaping by a narrow street that led along the wall of the mosque, was overtaken by Abdelasis, and, after a brief passage of arms between them, was overpowered and taken captive, while his guard fled, leaving him to his fate. That fate he well knew would be death. He therefore folded his hands upon his breast and calmly awaited it. `Melec,' said the Prince, turning to an Abyssinian near him, and who had not left following him through all the fight, `do thy duty.' The tall Abyssinian drew from its scabbard a heavy, glittering scymetar, and taking a hair from the mane of his horse, passed it across the blade delicately, the hair splitting evenly as it was drawn athwart the razor-like edge. He smiled with satisfaction, and leaping from his horse, advanced to the Emir, and without ceremony took him by his beard and pulled him down upon his knees.— He then stepped back. There was a flashing circle moving in the air, and the head of Algezir rolled at the feet of his conqueror. A crowd of his followers, at this instant, pressed round, and separated the Prince from the body. They would have rescued their chief. The Abyssinian, standing up, bade them take him, and pointing to the body, he fell back, and, leaping upon his horse near at hand, followed the Prince. Abdelasis and his guard, now once more galloped forward, not having been detained more than a minute by this summary execution on the battle-field. The Prince pursued a troop of the fugitives a short distance towards the gate, and then reining up, said to Osman and Ibrahim, `This is far enough for us to go; now let us return to the square, and occupy it, and let the Emir's forces cut to pieces those of Algezir. I must see that I am not conquered in my turn by them. Sound the recall,' he shouted to his trumpeters; and the clear notes of his bugles sounded throughout the city. The pursuers ceased their pursuit, and hastened back to rally around their chief in the square. There Abdelasis made a stand, and, marshalling all his forces, formed them again in close order of battle. The most of the Emirs on seeing the Algezirs give way, had gathered their people about them, and followed in hot pursuit; but there were three of them, who, instead of moving, remained near the Mosque, and with their bugles, were collecting their friends about them. Their movements Abdelasis had antieipated, and now clearly saw through. `Osman,' he said to his lieutenant, `thou seest those Princes there. They join not in the chase because they would take advantage of the absence of the rest, and so endeavor to win the Caliphate each for himself. Now that the Algezirs are defeated, we must make an end also of the power of the Emirs. We will charge upon these troops ere they are fully forward to resist us, and cut them in pieces. Thus will Cordova be mine.' With these words the Prince caused the charge to be sounded, and in a broad phalanx, he rode across the square upon the seven or eight hundred Moorish soldiers, assembled in three divisions, each under its own chief, and each jealous of the other. But they were willing to combine to resist the successful Prince, and endeavored to force him back by a flight of lances and arrows. But heedless of these weapons, the conquering Abdelasis spurred on, and fairly rode down the lines of the Emirs. In a few moments their defeat was complete. Two of the Emirs were slain, bravely fighting, scymetar in hand, and the third fled into the Mosque for safety, from his enemies. On all sides the defeated enemy fled, and were pursued down every street with great slaughter. Abdelasis now resolved to complete the work he had so propitiously begun. He ordered divisions to pursue the Emirs who were in pursuit of the flying Algezirs, and attack them in the rear. These chiefs, finding themselves thus pressed, and unable to withstand the charge against them, were filled with consternation. Some of them fled to the Mosques, others finding the gates in possession of Abdelasis' troops, threw themselves upon their own swords and died, while two of them sur rendered themselves prisoners, promising allegiance to the Prince; for every few minutes by his command, a herald had proclaimed pardon and peace to all who would lay down their arms, and acknowledge him as Caliph. Hundreds of the followers of the Emirs and of Algezir, finding that the star of Abdelasis was in the ascendant, availed themselves of this clemency, and, casting their arms at their feet, cried, `Long live Abdelasis. Long live the son of the prophet.' The sun was within an hour of his setting, when Abdelasis first entered the square at the head of his cavalry, and as he sank redly beyond the vale of the Guadalquiver, he was master of Cordova, and Caliph of the Moorish Empire in Spain. Ere darkness veiled the city, the sounds of combat had ceased, and there were but two parties within the walls, the conquerors and the vanquished. The Emirs, save the two who had sworn allegiance to Abdelasis, and the one who had made a sanctuary of the Mosque, were all dead, and their followers had purchased their heads, by transferring their allegiance to the conqueror. Every gate and strong-hold of the city was occupied by the troops of the Prince, and not a hostile arm was to be found in all the capital, raised against the power of the victorious Caliph. The Prince took possession of the Royal Palace of the Caliphate, and by the light of the rising moon raised the standard of the Prophet above its battlements. The trumpets sounded, and a herald proclaimed that, `Abdelasis Mohamed, Prince and Emir and descendant of the true Prophet of God, was from that hour Caliph of the Moorish Empire in Spain, and that life and death, laws and liberty are in his hand. Let all men bow the knee to Abdelasis, Caliph and Emperor. God is God and Mahomet is his Prophet!' This proclamation was made not only in front of the palace where Ibrahim elevated the standard, but at all the gates of the city and in the bazaars and public places. Before midnight the streets were silent. The wounded had been removed to an old Christian Church, which Abdelasis converted into a hospital for their accommodation, and the dead were carried away to be buried. The insubordinate had been lodged in prison and the rebellious executed. Guards were posted in every square and placed at each gate of the city; and patroles paraded the streets till morning. At the rising of the sun the muezzins from their minarets called in their loud sonorus tones, `God is great! There is but one God and Mahomet is his Prophet!' But to this usual religious cry and call to worship Allah, they added on this morning—`and Caliph Abdelasis is the Prophet's vicegerent! Let all true believers fear and obey him!' Thus had Cordova fallen into the hands of the courageous Abdelasis. By ingeniously uniting the sacred authority of a descendant of Mahomet with his power as a chieftain and conqueror he effectually secured the obedience and allegiance of the moslems when they saw him seated on the throne of power. By unfurling the banner of their faith above his palace he proclaimed himself not only their ruler but their delegated Prophet. Thousands of the haughty Moors who would still have resisted and plotted against the mere Prince and Caliph, yielded passive submission to the representative of their prophet. The revolution had been complete. Moorish Spain was once more governed by a Prince of the regal line who had a right to carry at the head of his armies the sacred standard. No longer torn by the daily dissensions of a score of gover nors, Cordova began already to feel the blessings of having the reins of government held in one man's hands. By ten o'clock, the morning after his brilliant conquest, Abdelasis made his appearance in the Divan of the Palace, followed by his nobles and proclaimed that he was ready to give audience, to redress grievances and execute judgment. He was arrayed in the gorgeous green and gold robe of the Imperial Caliphs, and his lofty brow was crowned with a crescent of diamonds that glowed like the sun. His countenance expressed grace and condescension. His officers stood around him also gorgeously attired in robes suited to their station. Hamet Osmen he had appointed his Vizier, and he now sat at his right hand clothed in purple and green with a golden scymetar at his girdle, and a lawn turban upon his head, sparkling with emeralds. On the Prince's left stood the youthful Ibrahim, whom he had made the Reis Effendi, or High Chancellor of his Empire. Numerous were the cases which were brought before the new Caliph, all of which he decided to the satisfaction of the parties and won for himself a name for great wisdom as well as for great bravery. Before night the fame of the Prince, who studied to ingratiate himself with all, looking upon every man now as his subject, had gone abroad not only through the city but into the wide valley. He invited by proclamation all who had fled to return, and they should be protected in their homes, and goods, and pursuits; and all who had gone forth from the city the day before now came into it again and resumed their avocations. Thus within twenty-four had Abdelasis by his courage and skill conquered a kingdom and established himself on its throne, ruling with absolute power. Once more the old Moors lifted up their faces and prophecied great glory in the Empire under the new Caliph; and, indeed, so far as appearances went, he seemed destined to confer additional glory upon the Moorish conquest of Spain.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER IV. THE TWO HERLSMEN. The news of the revolution in Cordova, of the overthrow of the government of the Emirs, of the death of the powerful Algezir, and of the accession of the conqueror, Abdolasis, to the Caliphate, thus consolidating the Moslem power in Spain, reached the ears of Gaspar and Alfonzo in their mountain home. The intelligence spread also far and wide in the valley and beyond the Sierras; but the news was received with indifference both by the Chrlstians and by the Moors. The former heard it with apathy, because it mattered little tn them who ruled in Cordova, so long as it was the power of the crescent that was wielded there; and the latter were satisfied because, if Abdelasis ruled in the place the Emirs, it was the decree of Allah. Thus they became submissive through their fatalism. `What is to be is to be! God is great, and Mahomet is his Prophet. Let Abdelasis live a thousand years. With these emphatie words the Moslem of the valley everywhere received the news of the change of Government. `There is great news, father,' said Alfenzo, as he entered the cabin, after having folded his gazelles at the close of the day in which Abdelasis sat upon the divan, giving judgment as Caliph. There is great news from Cordova. The Emirs have been defeated, and Abdelasis, our late guest, sits on the throne of the Caliphate!' `I heard it, boy! I was down in the valley, and there met a Spanish slave, gathering dry sticks, with which ha was lading an ass. He told me the news.' `Who was this slave that prefers life to liberty, or even to death?' Sancho, who once dwelt by the sprtng of the palms, and whose Moorish master now holds his house, and even his daughters in his harem—Sancho has since had his heart broken, or he would not live so submissive as a slave!' `There are ten thousand Spaniards, father, with whole hearts and strong arms, this day, submissive bondsmen to the Moor. Would to God it was not so! What said Sancho that he had heard; for I only got a thread of the news from Pioso, the goatherd's boy, who said he had met, as he was driving his goats towards the city this morning, some who told him that Abdelasis was Caliph. Heard you particulars?' `I was told by Sancho that yesterday afternoon the Emirs fought among themselves, and Algezir, taking advantage of their confusion, attacked them, when Abdelasis, who was supposed dead, suddenly made his appearance with a large force on the ground, defeated Algezir and slew him, and then utterly dispersed the forces of the Emirs, slaying all but one or two who fled to the mosques, and then he proclaimed himself Caliph, unfurling their sacred standard from the portico of the royal seraglio.' `This is more news than I got,' answered Alfonzo, with animated interest. `So our false Moor has indeed triumphed. How different now would have been the state of things in Cordova, had we detained him here or have let him perished upon the mountains. Heard you anything further?' `That the new Caliph has filled the strong places of the city with his troops, taken possession of all the gates and placed them under a strong guard, and proclaimed pardon to all who will swear allegiance to him; and he has also called back all who fled, promising them protection and security to their lives and property.' `He means to establish his throne by clemency, that he may rule by and by with tyranny. He begins mildly, to end cruelly. I know the man, father.' `His gracious manner of proceeding promises no good, I am sure. His smile is worse than his frown. Now that he is Caliph, boy, how is this new government to affect us? But this is a silly question. What matters to you and I who rules in Cordova? We are herdsmen under the Emirs, and we shall be herdsmen under Abdelasis. We were poor yesterday, and we shall be poor to-morrow also.— Spaniards no longer have any interest in the government of their native land. We are slaves, and all the change we have is change of masters.' `Yet we may feel the power of the new Caliph, father. The cup of bitterness and woe against poor Spain may not all be emptied! I fear the worst from the accession of this treacherous Prince. He is popular with his own people, and he is now formidable to his enemies. He will govern in such a manner that he will become their benefactor and our curse! He may be to them a mild ruler and an bonorable man, while only to us Christians he shows the dark side of his character!' `He cannot press us down lower than we already lie. I fear him not. But as you say, he may be wicked enough to do us more mischief than his predecessors have left to be done. Now I can conceive that he may command any Christian to pay a tax of half he possesses into his coffers; and forbid their coming into Cordova, except they submit to circumcision, which they keep up with their father Abraham, though they are degenerate sons of Ishmael, and deny the Scriptures, as father Godfrey says!' `Have you seen the holy father to-day?' `No.' `I was at his cell twice and he is not there. I fear he may have gone to Cordova!' `What should take him there?' This question Alfonzo could not answer; yet he believed that he had gone there in order to see Ben Osmin, who had already been gone since the morning before; and he was led to this belief from the fact that the hermit had been seen going down into the valley the evening before, but had not been known to return; and that he had gone to Cordova was, he thought, more than likely, as he had sent Ben Osmin there before him. That Ben Osmin had really gone, Alfonzo ascertained that very morning, by paying a stolen visit to the Emir's tower. He found the gates closed and fast, and all quiet about. The only guard was Lopo, the dog, who seemed indisposed in his jealousy of all comers, to recognise even the lover of his fair mistress. Satisfied that they had departed at the time Genilla had said she should go, that is early the morning before, he slowly left the place and hastened to the mountain to his herd. But he carried with him a sad heart, and a mind filled with apprehensions for the safety of Genilla in the city. He was prompted more than once to hasten to Cordova to ascertain her safety and urge her to return without longer delay in so dangerous a place, where power and might were right. But he could not desert his charge, nor could he with safety go into Cordova; for besides being known to Abdelasis, he was known to many Moors who had been with El Zegris and who were now in Cordova. But when, ie the course of the afternoon, he got the news from the boy Pioso of the revolution in the city, his anxiety for the safety of Genilla in such a scene rendered him inattentive to further particulars of the intelligence brought by the lad. He hastened with his flock down from the mountain, and folding it, resolved that he would commit its charge to Pablo, until he should learn how it went with Genilla in the warlike city. He now was half resolved to go at once under some safe disguise to see what had become of Ben Osmin and his fair daughter, amid all the tumult of battle in which she had been environed.— The idea that the hermit had gone into the city confirmed him in his half-formed determination to visit Cordova; for he feared that danger would menace the holy man as well as threaten Genilla. Love will seek excuses innumerable to defend any course it decides upon. So Alfonzo, nearly persuaded himself that his presence in Cordova was necessary for the safety of father Godfrey, although he was by no means certain that he had in reality gone there. That he was not in the mountain, he was well assured. He, therefore, when he recalled to mind his mysterious visit to Ben Osmin, and the subsequent departure of the latter, conceived that the same events which led the Moor to go to Cordova might have rendered it necessary also for father Godfrey to meet him there. It was these reflections, assisting his wishes, that led him to ask Gaspar the question he did. The interrogation with which it was answered, he could not reply to, or rather, he did not care to. If he had answered it, he would have to unfold more circumstances touching his knowledge of Father Godfrey's late movements than he wished to betray to Gaspar. `He could not go to the city, boy,' added Gaspar, without tossing his grey head. No, no, he is not in Cordova. Is it so rare a thing for the holy father to be absent, that you think he is gone to Cordova, if he be gone a day.' `But just at this time, father, it is dangerous for him to be in the valley. The Moors, elated with their new government, may be insolent and commit excesses. I am half of a mind to go to Cordova and see how things look there. I would like to have been there yesterday, during the fighting. It must have been a stirring scene. I shall, be able, father, to get into the city and out again, if I disguise myself as a Moor, which I will do. We have plenty of turbans, kaftans, and other of their Infidel apparel, taken from those whom we have conquered from time to time.' `I see no need of you going to the city, boy, unless you are tired of life. And I should disown you, to see your face under a Moslem's turban. Stay at home, and let the Moors and their city alone.' `I would see this Abdelasis on his throne; you know I have a quarrel with him.' `And I also,' answered the wolf-slayer, in a low fierce tone. `I would find occasion to punish him, Caliph though he be, and surrounded by his guards though he were.' `It would be needless. If thou goest, I go also. We both have quarrels with him. But it will not do for the mole to war with the eagle. We must be content to let things be. Come, boy, let Cordova and her Saracens alone. It grows late, and we should eat our suppers and go to bed. Where is Xariffa?' `Here, father,' answered the beautiful girl, entering at the moment, holding in her hand the beautiful net which she had heen at work upon when Abdelasis was in her apartment. `What is that, sister?' asked Alfonzo, looking upon her lovely face and figure, with the admiring eyes of fraternal affection and brotherly pride. Vol. 2. Sig. 2. `The net for my hair I have been the last three days at work upon. Is it not becoming?' and she threw it over her head, and letting the front fall upon her brow, she bound her tresses in it by a knot, and stood before them, looking, as if conscious of the beautiful appearance it gave to her head. `It is very becoming, child,' said Gaspar, smiling. `You are always handsome, and need no such ornaments; but still it is very pretty. `You have great taste, Xariffa. Such a head-dress would become a princess. How gracefully it falls to the shoulders, like a scarf for them. If it were less open it would serve for a veil.' `Look. It is a veil already,' ssid Xariffa, smiling. And casting it about her face, and drawing the meshes together, it concealed her face like silken lattice. `Father, I see your eyes are cast-towards the table, and doubtless, you think I had better have been baking bread for thy supper and Alfonzo's, than idling my time in such work. But I have not forgotten thee; come and see.' With these words, she took her father's hand in hers, and beckoning to her brother to follow, she led them towards her own room; and throwing open the door, she pointed silently to a neatly arranged table, placed in the midst of the floor, covered with a white cloth, and set out with two or three plates and cups, dearly cherished mementos of former glory, and loaded with such a display and variety, that Gaspar exclaimed, `By the red mass, what does this mean, girl? Bread, curds, goat's milk, leeks, dates, and wine. This is a feast for our Emir.' `This is a surprise,' exclaimed Alfonzo. `You have shown us your best housewifery, Xariffa.' `What does it all mean?' asked Gaspar, looking both surprised, and pleased at what he saw. `This is thy birth-day, father. If thou hast forgotten it, I have not,' answered the maiden, with bewitching grace. `By the rood, I had forgotten it. My blessing on thee, child. Never had a father such a treasure as I have in thee. Kiss me, dear! Kiss her, boy! There. Now let us thank God, and eat.'</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER V. THE BRIDE. The sumptuous supper, which the filial attention of Xariffa had provided for her father, in honor of his birth-day, had just been eaten by him and Alfonso, when there was heard in the outer room a loud voice, calling out—`Ho! Alfonso. Ho, Gaspar!' The two men sprung to their feet, and hastened to the main apartment of their hut, where they beheld two mountaineers, a young and an old man. They were looking very much excited, and upon the forehead of the young man was a heavy wound. `How is this? What has happened, neighbors?' cried Gaspar and Alfonso, in the same breath. `The Moors, Gaspar! The accursed Moors, Alfonso!' answered the old man, trembling with fear and rage, while he shook his clenched hand. `Yes,' criod the younger, more calmly, yet evidently labouring under intense emotion; `it is a new outrage of our tyrants, Alfonso. Thou shalt hear all.' `Sit down, Tito, sit down,' said Gaspar, offering him at the same time, a small bench. `No, no. This is no time to sit!— Tell him, Louis! Tell him what hath happened. But, then, what good for them to know it. We can do nothing, we are slaves!' `Yes, they shall hear. The brave Alfonso shall know all, and he may aid me in revenge, if not in rescue! Thou knowest, Alfonso, that I was to have been married this night to the fair Agata, the daughter of the old miller, who lives at the mill?' `I heard so, Louis.' `And this afternoon when the sun was about two hours high, I started with my father and brother, and two friends, to go by the cliff path, and so down the valley road to the mill. But when we came near it we saw it in flames, and hastening forward, the cries of combat reached us, above which rose the shrieks of a female. I recognised the voice of Agata and rushed forward. As we got to the gate of the wall that encloses the court, we saw at least a dozen of Moors, engaged in plundering the house, while two of them were bearing off Agata between them on their horses. Upon seeing our approach, they galloped forward to pass us, but I seized one of the horses by the rein, and struck with my staff the rider to the ground; but the other succeeded, with Agata in his arms, in escaping into the plain, followed by the rest of the Moors.' `I would have stayed the man who fled with the maiden,' said old Tito, but he rode over me too quickly for me to grapple with him. But two of the Moors we tipped out of their saddles; but their horses escaped, or we would have mounted them and pursued!' `It would not have availed, Alfonso,' answered Louis, with accents of deep grief. `They flew like the wind across the plain. She is lost to me for ever! I shall never forget her looks and cries of anguish as she passed me, shrieking— `Save me!' Oh, save me, Louis!' I did all man could do, but Heaven ordered that I should lose her! I was turning to pursue her on foot, when old Simeon came tottering up to me, bleeding with many wounds, which he had received in defence of his house and child. I stopped to support him. He had life only to tell me that he had done all in his power to protect Ageta; that the party of Moors had come to him demanding money, which not having to give, they had attacked and fired his house, and carried away his child!' `To sell her into slavery in the public Bazaar!' cried Tito, with indignant warmth. Gaspar, thou hast heard this outrage now. But thou answerest nothing. Does it not touch thee?' Suppose it had been thine own—' `Hush! Utter not such a thought to me! I was silent, because I could not find words to express my feelings. My heart was swelling too high for utterance. Boy,' he added, turning to Alfonso, who had listened with the most intense interest to the account of the young bridegroom, and now walked up and down the paved floor, with quick and firey steps.— His eye blazed, and his hand grasped vehemently his wolf-spear. There was a stern determined resolution in his tread that spoke more eloquently than words. `How long since was this?' he suddenly stopped and demanded of Luis. `Not two hours; I have come hither as soon as I could, giving the news as I came to each hut. Oh! Alfonzo, that you could once more rouse the Sierras to arms, and avenge for me this wrong!— But what can be done? Nothing, I know; we are but a few hundreds, and the land is filled with Moors.' `No, no—nothing can be done;' answered old Tito, shaking his gray head. `We must bear it;—but it does us good to tell one another of our wrongs—this is all we expect!' `When will Heaven have pity on our poor land?' cried Xariffa, with strong earnestness, having heard all. `Alas for the helpless fate of Agata! So good, so gentle, so fond of thee, Luis!' `Do not speak of her, Xariffa!—my heart will burst!' sobbed the young man, covering his face with both hands. `By the red mass!' cried Gaspar, `I feel in my arm the energy of a thousand men to avenge a wrong like this. As you were about to say, it might have been me instead of Simeon the miller. Did he die?' `We left him stark and stiff,' answered Tito. `Yes, he died after telling us what had befallen him and his; and I at once came along the mountain road this way, while my brother and my two friends went northward to give the alarm, and rouse the indignation of the people, and put them on the watch lest their own homes be invaded; for Simeon said that the Moorish captain told him that they were but one party of several, sent from Cordova to-day by the new Caliph Abdelasis, to levy subsidies of gold and silver for the support of the new government; and also with orders to make captive the most beautiful of the mountain maidens.' `So, if Simeon had given them gold,' said Gaspar, `they would still have taken his child.' `I thought,' cried Alfonzo, in tones that rung again, `I thought that the cup of our woes and degradation was full; but I see that there are yet outrages we can suffer! My friends, we must expect from Abdelasis such things as these, if we will bear them:—and what can we do?' `Nothing but bear them!' answered Tito despondingly. `We cannot help ourselves!' said Gaspar. `We are weak and they are powerful—we must submit.' `I would that I had five hundred good Christian arms with mine,' cried Alfonzo, `I would not bear these things—I would lead them on to the very gates of Cordova—I would rescue Agata for thee, Luis, or have Abdelasis's head!' `Where wilt thou find even a hundred men, boy, who would follow thee to Cordova? We may get together a band to drive robbers from our Sierras, as we would band together against wolves to destroy them; but go to-night with Luis by thy side through the whole breadth and length of the mountains—let him proclaim at the door of every hut the wrong he has suffered, and let you call with the voice of a trumpet upon their inmates to arm and follow thee to the gates of Cordova, to bring back or avenge the maiden—what would they answer? Would they move? would they not call thee a madman? The men of Spain fear the Moor as well as hate him, boy! They dare not go forth in their strength to give him battle again, and drive him from heir soil.—We are all become slaves and serfs!' `I fear it is true what you say, father. I should fail in getting men to follow me to rescue this maiden. They fear the Moor; they are slaves—they, and you, and I—and we fear our masters! Oh! if my life, laid upon the altar of my country, would save it, gladly would I sacrifice it! But these wishes are vain, neighbors. Luis,' he added, grasping the hand of the unhappy youth—`You have lost Agata, and my heart bleeds for you! I feel for you as if you were my brother: for this is a wrong that comes home to us all. To-morrow every young man may stand in your place—every maiden in the place of the lost Agata. If by giving my life I could aid you, cheerfully would I give it; but I know not what to do—my father hath spoken too truly.' `I fear he has. Yet I know not what hopes led me to come to thee, Alfonzo! All eyes turn to you in danger!— All hearts throb with pride when thou art named. Yet I know you cannot help me.' `And heavy is my sorrow and shame that I cannot. The Moor is stronger now than heretofore. Abdelasis is powerful! He will consolidate his empire by the union of the numerous parties that have hitherto weakened and torn it. We can do nothing! We can only pray to Heaven to have mercy upon us and not inflict upon us more than we can bear!' Thus speaking, Alfonzo walked slowly and sadly across the room. Luis stood silently gazing after him, and seemed to be wholly overcome with his great loss— the heaviest and most grievous man can suffer. Old Tito did nothing but utter terrible denunciations against the Moors, and vehemently call upon the saints to interpose to their overthrow. Gaspar sat upon a bench, sullen and silent, his face between his hands, which rested upon his kness. By the door stood Xariffa, gazing in upon them with a pale countenance and looks of anxious solicitude. For some minutes all was still; each one engaged in his own painful thoughts. Suddenly the silence was broken by a heavy tread without, as if men and horses were approaching. Alfonzo sprung to the window, and, by the glowing twilight, for the sun had just gone down, he beheld three men coming very fast towards the hut. By their garb he knew them to be mountaineers, though two of them carried scymetars and a third was mounted upon a richly caprizoned Arabian steed. They were evidently bearers of some news, from their excited manner. `Who comes without?' cried Gaspar, slowly rising from his bench. `One of them is Guiseppo, and mounted upon a Moorish horse; the others are friends, though armed with scymetars!' answered Alfonzo as he threw open the door. `Thank the saints, thou art at home, brave Alfonzo, and thou Gaspar; and here is Luis and his father too!' were the words of the one upon the horse. `I am glad I have found thee!' `What is the matter? Hast thou met the Moors?' cried Alfonzo. `Yes, and slain each our man!' `God and the saints be blessed!' shouted Tito. `Hast thou seen Agata? Say that she is rescued!' cried Luis, as he laid his hand upon the arm of the speaker. `I know nothing of any rescue or of a maiden, neighbors,' answered the man, as he leaped from the horse. `Thou shalt know all. But briefly learn that this horse was half an hour ago straddled by a Moor, and that the two scymetars my two honest friends here bear were grasped by Infidel hands!' `How came this about?' demanded Gaspar, as he walked round the horse and looked at his rich harnessing, and then took one and the other of the scymetars into his hand to look at. `Hast thou heard the law yet?' asked Guiseppo, who was a short, crooked little man, with a very brilliant eye and a resolute air. `What law?' asked Alfonzo. `Dost thou speak of a law of the new Caliph's?' `Yes. Thou knowest Abdelasis is king of the Moors?' `We know it. Proceed! What law is this?' `It will astonish you. But I don't know that we ought to be astonished at any thing. This very day noon he issued a decree that every Christian within the realm of his rule should, within thirty days, report himself at the palace of Cordova, and there be registered, his name and his worldly goods, and his children and their ages; and this on pain of death for disobeying the edict!' `Do I live to hear this thing?' cried Gaspar, with intense feeling. `Peace, father,' said Alfonzo, with forced calmness: `words are not for such acts as these we are listening to! Peace, father, he has more yet to say!'</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER VI. THE DEATH OF THE MOORS. All bent eagerly forward to hear what heavier outrage than this already related, could be conceived against the conquered Christians by their conquerors. `Yes,' answered Guesippo, `I have more to say. The edict which I have spoken of, not only calls on us to register our names before the Reis Effendi, but it declares every Christian who shall refuse to become a follower of the Prophet, and worship in the Mosque of Omar on the day he registers his name, a slave, and as such to be brought and sold, as other slaves, in the bazaar!' `Do my ears hear thee aright, Guesippo?' asked Alfonso, in a low impressive tone; and he laid his hand upon his shoulder for the answer. `What I have just now said I will repeat.' `No, no. These are enough. Now, tell me how thou hast heard this?' `Yes, Guesippo,' cried Gaspar and Luis in one breath! `Tell us how it came to thee?' `From the Moor's lips who sat in this saddle.' `Ah! Didst thou know him?' `Listen and know all I know, Alfonso. I was going with these two herdsmen, to sell a dozen goats to the Mufti, who lives in the Mosque, in the plain, once the Church of the village of San Maria. I would not sell to the Infidel, but we must live, neighbours. We must have gold and the Moors alone have it. I have often sold to the Mufti before, and made him pay well; though I would have been glad that the first mouthful of goat's flesh had choked him, and every Infidel that ate of it. I will secure this firey horse to the stake by the corner of thy hut, Gaspar!' `A thousand wishes wont kill one Moor,' answered Tito, as Guesippo returned and leaned with his back against a block at the door, while the others gathered around him with dark looks and earnest attention; the tall form of Alfonso over-topping them all. Directly opposite, and keenly facing Guesippo, stood Gaspar, leaning on his broken boar-spear, his wolf's knife by his side.— Old Tito, supported by a staff taller than himself, stood within the door in the shade; and next to Gaspar, with her hand upon his arm and indistinctly seen, bent the fair form of Xariffa, eagerly listening. `I had sold my goats,' continued Guesippo, `and left the Mufti with my silver in my pouch, and accompanied by my two men here, who had helped me to drive the goats. I had not gone more than half a mile, when I heard galloping and shouting behind me, and looking back what should I see but three Moors on horseback coming after us at top speed. The road was narrow, and there was a thick brush hedge on either side, so that we could not get out of their way; for I had no desire to be too familiar with them, especially as I had a pouch of silver at my girdle. So I resolved to run for it; but finding they were coming up, I spoke to my men and said, we are three Christians to three unbelievers! Let us give them battle in the name of the Virgin. Each of you seize a horse by the bit, while you defend your heads with your staves, from the blows of their scymetars, and it may be, we will unhorse them! My men promised to do as I did, and turning full upon them, we rushed to meet them with loud cries, each of us seized a horse by the bit, and guarded our heads with our staves from the blows of their scymetars. Two of the Moors were unhorsed by the sudden shock given them by their horses being stopped so suddenly. The other broke away and fled, seeing us despatch these two before they could rise. One of the horses got off also, but I held mine firmly by the bit, and in an instant was in his saddle in pursuit of the fugitive. But he rode better than I, and turning back I bade my men take the scymetars of the dead Moors and come after me. So we held on our way at a good speed fearing pursuit; for the village was not half a mile behind us. But, thank the saints, we have reached here in safety, and show you our horses and arms as proofs of our words!' `You have done well, Guesippo, you and your friends. By the mass!' cried Gaspar, `I would I had the killing of these Moors!' `And you saved your gold?' enquired old Tito. `Yes, and have this fine horse and these scymetars besides; one of them, you see, has a hilt of solid gold.' `We should have great spoil of these Infidels, if we would have courage to fight them,' said Gaspar. `And these Moors were not then those who bore away Agata,' said Luis, with a tone of deep disappointment. `I had hoped, at least, that if she were not rescued she had been avenged.' Here Alfonzo briefly informed Guesippo of the outrage against Luis, and the death of Simeon the miller. `I saw such a party of Moors at a distance, passing east of the Mosque,' answered Guesippo. `They were a good three quarters of a mile off, and were riding towards Cordova.' `It must have been the same,' cried Luis. `Oh, my poor, lost Agata—what must be thy anguish, as well as mine!' `Slaves! slaves! slaves!' slowly and impressively repeated Alfonzo, as he walked up and down the room. `We are then become slaves! Oh, Christian men! can Spain submit to this? There are thousands in the land who have yet thought themselves free, so long as the Moor kept his hand from their tables; but they will now feel the weight of the Moslem yoke! Would to God they could feel it cut into their necks so deeply that, unable to bear it longer, they would throw it off as one man, and cry, `Liberty! and for God and Spain!' At these stirring words, those about him started, and Gaspar waving his staff, repeated the cry— `Liberty! God and Spain!' `Words—mere words, my friends!' said Alfonzo, dropping his head sadly. `We have voices, and can speak—that is all! They have not cut out our tongues yet; but so long as we can do no more than talk, let us be silent. Men should use their steel, not their tongues!' `Alfonzo, if thou wilt tell me how to use mine to purpose,' cried Luis, `I swear to thee it shall be drawn and made good use of! I will not give rest to my body till I have avenged or rescued Agata.' `Thou talkest madly, boy!' cried Gaspar; `thou mightest as well say you will pluck Abdelasis by the beard before his divan.' The young man blushed, feeling too keenly the rebuke; for he felt that he was impotent—that he could in truth accomplish nothing. `I cannot tell thee, Luis, what to do— save to bear or die,' answered Alfonzo, in answer to his call upon him for aid. `Spain will never move to throw off her yoke, or avenge her wrongs, without a prince to lead her to the field.' `We must have a leader, Alfonzo— but it need not be a prince,' answered Luis. `If thou shouldst raise thy standard upon a peak of the Sierra, every man within sight of it would hasten to rally around thee.' `I believe it, boy,' answered Gaspar. `There is no doubt of it,' cried Guesippo. `Do not all men know thee to be brave—to love thy country—to mourn for her wrongs? Trust me, neighbors, that all in the mountains would sooner follow Alfonzo here than a prince whom they know not. We have tried thee, Alfonzo.' `Mock me no more!' answered Alfonzo, with a bitter smile. `Mock me no more, my friends, and you my father. I have slain wolves and driven robbers— am I therefore a leader of a people? You make me scorn myself, to think I should be so idly talked of, and entreated. My standard! What is it?—a wolf's hide? No, no! Make me not angry, my friends.' Thus speaking, the young man left them, and walked into the cabin. `Yet I will maintain my words, though he be angry,' said Luis to the rest. `If it were known that all men might have an opportunity of redressing their wrongs by flocking to the standard of Alfonzo, even were it no more than a wolf's skin hung upon his spear, he would find himself at the head of an army ere thirty days.' `I know it. The Spaniard is no longer asleep,' said Gaspar, `we are all awake to our wrongs. Our hatred of the Moor is ready to drive away our fears.' `I pray you, Gaspar,' said Guesippo. `I pray you talk with thy son.' `And press the matter upon him. He is the only man in Spain can save Spain,' said Luis. `Fair Xariffa, speak to thy brother, and rouse him to give the subject attention.' `My brother needs no rousing, friend,' said the maiden; `he feels too keenly now the wrongs his country bears. I have heard him groan, by night when others slept, over the oppression of his country. But he feels that he can do nothing, and what can he do? He is, even as yourselves, poor and without power. He would die for Spain, but his death would not redeem Spain. We must look to heaven, not to man, for aid.' `The maiden spcaks truly,' answered Tito. `I see nothing that we can do.' `And shall we tamely become slaves to the Moor?' `I would like to know what man will first give his name to be put on the register,' said Gaspar with closed teeth, and speaking through them. `If I were by I would put my knife into his body.' `Yet, thou wilt have to do it thyself, Gaspar, brave as thou art,' answered Guesippo. Thou must do it or lose thy life.' `I will not register my name there. May I cut off my right hand ere it is so false to me.' `What wilt thou do?' asked Luis. `Wait till they come after me.' `And then?' `Write my name on their hearts with my broad knife,' responded the wolf-slayer, as he pressed the point of his knife upon the palm of his own hand. Then those who would, after me, write their names, may dip their pens in my blood, if they will. I go not to Cordova to worship in their Mosques—not I.' `Who talks of going to Cordova?' asked Alfonzo, coming forth with a stern brow, and firey air. `Who will bend his neck to the heel of the Moor? Speak; for I would see him?' `That is the temper I am glad to see thee in, my boy,' cried Gaspar with delight. `Thou didst mistake. Said I, for one, I go not to Cordova.' `And who also says he will not go among you?' asked Alfonzo, in the hoarse deep tones of a man who is deeply excited, but is endeavoring to repress all outward emotion. `I say not that I will not go to Cordova, but I say that I will never bow my knee in the Mosque of Omar,' firmly responded Luis. `I must see Cordova; for I must avenge Agata. I go there, not to use a pen, but a dagger.' `Bravely worded, boy,' cried Tito. `That spear hath the metal in it;' said Gaspar. `With one thousand men of such spirits, I would not fear to call on Abdelasis in his seraglio. What thinkest thou, boy? You seem gloomy.' `Gloomy? No, no; I am right merry. Have we not enough to make us glad? We, poor, valueless peasants, are to become of worth. We are to be priced by the head. Rejoice, Gaspar! Thou wilt be worth, perhaps, six hundred moidores of silver, and thou Luis, as many, perhaps. I may sell for five hundred; and thou, Guesippo, for five hundred and fifty, while Tito may be priced at three hundred, going less, in consideration of his age. Merry! Have we not reason to be merry; to think that we poor rogues of Christians are really worth so much counted gold. Who dares to be gloomy?' No one answered him. His words sunk deep into their hearts. With but few words more they separated, each to his home and bed, there to forget awhile their own and their country's wrongs.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER VII. THE GAZELLE-KEEPER ON THE HILLS. Early on the ensuing morning, ere the day fairly broke, Alfonzo opened the door of the hut and walked forth. He had passed a sleepless night. The wrongs of his country, his sympathy for Luis, the edicts of Abdelasis, all pressed upon his thoughts and kept him waking. The most of the night he passed in pacing his room and devising a thousand schemes of exalted patriotism; but each of which he rejected as visionary. Conscious of his own weakness and that of Spain, compared with the power of Abdelasis, he he felt that all he could do was to weep and pray for his country. He felt—so reasoned he—that it was for God's honor that the crescent should be overthrown and the cross replaced, and he trusted that God would open a way to have it done. He trembled too for the safety of Xariffa. Ignorant that Abdelasis had seen and spoken with her, he nevertheless feared for her lest she might be taken away during his absence, as Agata had been borne off. He could not, however, place her where she could be safer. His hut was his only castle, and no place he could command was safer than that. To be there always was impossible; yet he hoped that the retired bamlet would escape the marauding parties of the Moors. At any rate, he resotved that either he or Gaspar would always remain at home; and he determined to arm all in the hamlet, and keep up a watch upon the path down to the valley. The ab sence of Genilla also, to Cordova, with her father, now for two days, deeply occupied his mind. His thoughts were tortured with the imaginations of a thousand evils which might have befallen her. At one moment he felt it his duty to go and seek her and ascertain her fate, and at the next he felt that a duty equally sacred called upon him to remain for the protection of Xariffa. He could not divide himself. He was, therefore, in a state of the most painful anxiety and suspense. Gladly, therefore, did he hail the first note of the cock which proclaimed the night departed and day at hand. It was still dark when he came out of doors. The stars were glittering like diamonds, and scarce a change in the deep blue of the sky, told which was the eastern horizon. The air was still, and silence and peace reigned everywhere about him, save in his bosom. He walked on a few paces, and he then thought he saw some object move in the darkness before him. He looked intently, and listening, he was sure he heard a small stone move, as if it had struck against another, as a footstep would disturb it. He thought of his fold of gazelles on the north side of his hut, and of the prowling wolf, and whistled low for his dog, while he stepped back into the door for his wolf-spear. He came out instantly, followed by Gaspar, whom he had called up. Both were armed and advancing cautiously towards the deep shadows under the woody rock, where he had heard the movemenls; he could discover nothing. They walked around the fold, and all was quiet. Ban the wolf-dog came towards them and rubbed his nose against them, and seemed to suspect something. `It must have been your fancy, boy,' said Gaspar. `I am sure I saw some object moving, but so indistinctly, I could not tell whether man or beast. The next moment I heard the noise under that date-rock.' `It may have been the dog himself.' `It is likely, since we discover nothing. If it had been a wolf, he would have left his scent on the air, and Ban would have snuffed it! Do you go to the hills this morning, father?' `Why do you ask that? Have I not four score goats to feed on the mountains? Must I not watch them and show them where to browse, and pick up their scanty forage? I am not rich enough to stay in the valley a day while the Moor is in the land. I might ask you if you were going to keep your sixty gazelles and kids in their folds to-day!— Come, let us rake our breakfasts in our scrips and off!' With these words, Gaspar, who this morning was in a worse humor than usual, removed the oaken bar from the gate of his fold, and going in sullenly, drove out his herd and turned them up the mountain. He then entered his cabin, where Xariffa was already stirring, took his bag or scrip containing his breakfast, and fastened it to his rough and hairy girdle. `Now the good angels keep thee on the hills to-day, father!' said the maiden, as she kissed, as her custom was, his cheek before he went out. `Thy face is heavy! I hope thou art not ill!' `I am sick for poor Spain, daughter,' was his answer. `Keep close within today. Thou knowest enemies are abroad. I shall not wander out of sight of the cabin, so that if the Moor be seen in the valley, coming this way, I may be here to do battle for thee!' `Father, the Holy Virgin will protect all who trust in her!' `I hope so, child, I hope so! Let me kiss thee again! There! Now take care of thyself. I feel sad to-day, very sad and heavy. But it will pass off when I get upon the hills where the fresh air blows!' At this moment entered Alfonzo, who had also turned his gazelles from the fold and sent them with Ban up the hill-side. `Boy,' said Gaspar, `we have a kid here to guard against worse wolves than menances our folds. If thou canst keep in sight of the hamlet through the day, and also have a sharp eye upon the roads in the valley. If thou seest any parties prowling about our glen, hasten home, sounding thy goat-horn with the fierce war notes that used to ring in the ears of El Zegris!' `I will do so, father. I feel that we have in Xariffa a most sacred charge.— At any hour the Moor may be in our hamlet!' `Fear not, brother,' said the matden, smiling, though in truth she felt sorrowful at heart; for since she knew that the youthful Moor who had declared his passion fer her was the same Abdelasis, now become Caliph, she trembled at a power which, prompted by his mad love, might make her its victim. `Fear not, brother. The fearless are ever secure!' `Heaven grant that no danger come nigh thee, my sister. I go now upon the hills, but as no Moor can come near the hamlet without being seen in the valley, I shall be here as soon as a foe can be. But I trust our little humble home will escape the eye of the destroyer!' Xariffa now prepared her brother's breakfast as she had her father's, and in a few minutes afterwards he was slowly winding his way up the side of the mountain after his gazelles. The dawn was just silvering the east as he reached the rock by the old date tree where he had first heheld Abdelasis, when haughtily advancing he commanded him and the hermit to give way and let him pass.— The valley of the Guadalquiver still lay in darkness and the repose of night. A he ascended, the light increased, and when about six hundred feet up the mountain, he paused, and by a signal dispersed his gazelles to forage. He then watched the opening day. Gradually the sky brightened, changing its pale, silvery hue to a mellow rose, and the rose deepened into a purple, which rapidly catching the glories of the advancing sun, became a rich deep hue of gold. The valley threw off its veil of darkness, and the forest stood boldly forth from the plains, and then the vineyards became distinct, then the villas upon them and the gardens; and soon the Guadalquiver, catching the golden radiance of the moon, shone like a burnished spear; and suddenly the crescents of the Mosques in Cordova flashed back the first beams of the sun which had already some minutes before kindled the peaks of the Sierras. The position from which Alfonzo beheld the day advancing hid from his sight the hamlet; as he intended to go higher up the mountain still, where it would once more be in view beneath him, as well also the Emir's tower. He, therefore, now began slowly to drive his flock before him to the higher region of the mountain. He had proceeded but a short distance, when he beheld Gaspar, who was standing upon a bold rock on the opposite side of a vast cleft in the hill, and waving his bernish towards him and at the same time pointing down the mountain in the direction of the valley. Alfonzo could also hear him shout, but could not understand what he said, for he was a third of a mile distant. But suspecting from his manner, and seeing him begin rapidly to descend the rocks with great leaps, that some enemy was in sight, he hastened forward to a bold promontory which commanded a full view of the hamlet and the family. As he ran he heard the sound of a horn blown in the direction of the gorge. Loud voices came to his ears from the hamlet. He thought he heard a female shriek. He bounded onward—he flew! he out-stripped the wind. He reached the promontory and glanced down the sleep mountain side. The roofs of the eight or nine cabins composing the hamlet were directly beneath his feet. Could his eyes be believed. But his ears confirmed their vision. There was a party of not less then three score Moorish horsemen—the fierce Zenetan cavalry by their red sashes and long lances, in possession of the hamlet. The door of the hut was thronged with them. Two or three mountaineers were seen flying up the glen with terror, and Pablo was visible ascending the mountain, blowing the horn he had heard. A glance showed all this to the startled eyes of Alfonzo. He comprehended all his sister's danger. It was with an effort he resisted the impulse to fling himself from the lofty height on which he stood among his enemies. He saw one bring his sister forth shrieking, and leap into his saddle with her in his arms. He staid but a second to wind a war blast upon his horn, and then, with rage and grief burning his breast, he flew to her rescue, not calculating the numbers against him. The strange conduct of Gaspar was now explained to him. He saw that he had first discovered the Moors in the hamlet. As he descended, Gaspar met him at the intersection of the paths. Neither spoke a word, but, grasping hands, bounded down the steep path towards the hamlet. As they descended they could see the Moors galloping out of the hamlet, and beheld them going at a slow pace carefully down the rocky way by the cascade. They could see Xariffa clasped in the arms of the foremost, borne farther and farther from their eyes Who can picture their grief and bitterness of soul? At length they reached the hamlet. They stopped not to go into their now deserted cabin. They knew that she, so loved, was no longer there. Pablo and two of the herdsmen of the hamlet joined them. The five pursued with the speed of hounds. But horse were fleeter even than the feet of love or the wings of vcngeance. When they got into the plain and could see before them a mile through the forest, the party of horse were just visible disappearing in a slight depression of the road, and evidently moving at a very rapid rate. `Stay, Alfonzo! We may as well stay and leave her to her fate. We can do nothing. God has cursed us! Let us lie down and die!' and Gaspar, the strong stout Gaspar, with his iron frame and courageous heart, sank upon the green sward beneath a forest tree, and buried his head between his knees. Alfonzo could not gainsay his father's words. He well knew that pursuit would be in vain. That to attempt, even if he came up with the party, to rescue her, would be attended with the sacrifice of his own and his father's life without benefit to her. He stopped, therefore, following the waving plumes of the Zenetan horse until they were out of sight, and then striking his forehead in the anguish of his soul, he cried, as he gazed upon his prostrate father, `You are right, we can do nothing, you and I and these three; but the time has come when these shall become three thousand! From this hour I swear, and hear me Heaven! I swear that I will live only for vengeance and the freedom of Spain! This hour I dedicate myself to my country! If there be no Prince to lead, let men follow a peasant, so he lead them to liberty and revenge!'</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER VIII. THE CONSPIRACY. At these stirring words of Alfonzo, uttered as they were in the stern moment, and under the fierce influence of the bitterest grief, Gaspar raised his face from between his knees and smiled. The smile was not scornful nor mocking, but it was like a beam of sunshine from his soul. He rose to his feet, and looking Alfonzo steadfastly in the eyes, he said, `Young man, thy speech would have brought me to life, had I been dead. Did thy words come from thy heart?' `From the depths of my being, my father. I can no longer remain passive.— Well did Guiseppo say I needed to be roused. I am now roused fully. It only wanted this last drop to make my cup too bitter to be drank. `Xariffa!' he cried, stretching out his hands in the direction the Moors had borne her, `be patient! Thou shalt be avenged! Henceforth I know only thee and my country. Father, I am but one—and these our friends are but three more; but we will increase apace. There is Luis and Tito, and Luis's brother, and there are our neighbors on the east and west and north of us. They will join us when they hear that Alfonzo would avenge his sister, for they all loved her.' `Oh, this is worth living for, boy!' cried Gaspar. Now thou art thyself. I see that it wanted but this. You no longer doubt your power and influence!' `I doubt nothing. I am all hope. I will accomplish everything that I am going to undertake. Xariffa may not be saved from the harem of the despoiler, but she shall be avenged. Now, father, let us talk calmly of what shall be done. For the present let us forget my sister.— Let us bend our minds to the great purposes that are pressing upon them. Thou art ready to be with me in what I will do, father?' `There is my hand, boy; and I make upon it and thine the sign of the cross.' `It is enough! Now hear me! There are yet to be found in the mountains the hundred men who have fought with me against El Zegris. Go to each of them and say that Alfonzo needs them again, and that he raises his standard— `The wolf-skin!' `No—not now. That will do to go against robbers with. But now we are to fight the infidel and war against the crescent. Say to them that Alfonzo has raised the standard of the Holy Cross on the rock of St. Paul, and they that love Spain must hasten to it without delay, and each bring his companion with him.' `Oh, this tells again. I could almost forgive the Moor for robbing me of my child, to know that another blow is to be struck for Spaiu.' `I would I had not been so selfish. I would that the tale of other's wrongs had come home to me as this has done. I did, indeed, have need to be touched close to my heart to feel as I ought. But there shall be no lack of action now. I will avenge both Luis and myself, if my countrymen will stand by me. Oh! who have we here? A horseman, and lo! a score of footmen running after him!' `It is Guiseppo. There is Luis also and a score of friends,' cried Gaspar.— `They come armed. Hear their shouts. They have heard of our loss, and come bravely to the rescue.' `Thank God! This does not look like cowardice!' said Alfonzo. `I do in my heart believe that the hour has come not only for me to act, but all Spain to feel that it must rouse from its bondage. How bravely they come on. What ho, friends! Welcome!' `Is this news true?' cried Guiseppo, who, mounted on the Moor's horse he had captured the day before, came first up, brandishing a scymetar in his hand. `Too true, Guesippo.' `And where are they?' `Beyond pursuit: we abandoned it here in despair.' `I could go no further, neighbors,' said Gaspar; `when I saw my child disappear beyond succor, I sank beneath this great tree, and should have died here, but for words that came from Alfonzo that put life into me, and, as you see, have made me strong again.' `What were they?' cried Luis; `let us hear them.' `That from this hour he would consecrate himself to the liberty of Spain and the overthrow of the Saracen! He spoke from his heart, and I stood up and embraced him, thanking God that the only man who can redeem Spain had resolved to redeem her. Yes, Alfonzo, surprised you look: but I assure you that every patriot in the land has had his eyes on you with hopes they hardly dared breathe.' `I thank them all; I will fulfil those hopes, my friends, or perish! The audacity of the Saracen has got to its height; our forbearance has given him power and insolence: we are slaves because we had not courage to be freemen. Luis, Gaspar, my father, you my friends all, go and tell each his neighbor the tale of wrong done this day. Luis, I need not urge you to be diligent in rousing the people—your wrongs shall be avenged as well as my own and our country's. Now, Luis, bear to each man thou meetest the word that Alfonzo has raised the standard of the cross, and calls on all Christians to rally around it. Here come more of our friends.' `By the mass! we shall number fifty soon!' cried Gaspar: `see how they rush onward!' `Would that the Moorish party were now near!' said Alfonzo; `we would rescue Xariffa, and punish her captors! But we have now only to look to vengeance. Welcome, neighbors! you are too late to pursue the Moor, but not too late to draw the sword in defence of Spain!' As he was speaking, a party of at least twenty-eight men, herdsmen and mountaineers, armed with spears and pikes and large knives, came up one after the other. They had heard the sound of the war-trumpet, and hearing from the women they met in the hamlet what had occurred, they boldly pressed forward to join Gaspar and Alfonzo in pursuit. `Dost thou know, Juan,' said Gaspar, to one who seemed to be the leader of the party,—`dost thou know that Alfozo has promised to lead against the Moor, as he did against El Zegris, all who will follow him?' `Then he will find himself at the head of ten thousand men, for this number of our countrymen will follow him,' answer-the man with animation. `But this is too good news!' `It is nevertheless true, my friend,' answered Guesippo; `we are to have a leader, and the Moor shall yet tremble on his divan! We must strike now for Spain, or never. We have but thirty days in which to become slaves, or free Spain of the Moors!' `The nobles will not follow him,' said a young man of the party that was just come up. `They despise the peasants of the mountains.' `We need not the nobles' aid,' answered Gaspar; `we peasants will free Spain. Every true man, noble or serf, will rally around him who dares set up the standard of the cross within sight of the crescent. Our nobles are exiles, and poor and depressed, and their pride is gone. If they will not come to the rescue, let them remain in their bondage. We at least will be free. Thirty days, neighbors, is a short time to drive the Moor out of Spain—but, God willing, we will do it.' `We must go to work secretly at first not to alarm the Moor and awaken his vigilance,' said Alfonzo, looking around him into the dark forest in which they were thus accidentally assembled.— `There are no foes looking on—yet let us be cautious with our voices. `The Moor must be ignorant to the last moment. The time to do something for Spain is ceme. I feel my own weakness and inexperience, but as you call on me to lead in this great movement, I will do so, till some one abler shall take the conduct of it. It is needful that some one should stand up for Spain, though it be one so humble as I am.— What I am I give to you, and to my country.' `Lo! The hermit.' `Father Godfrido!' `See! There comes the holy Abbot,' cried several voices, pointing along the forest path where he had just appeared; and Gaspar hastened to meet the old man who was advancing towards the group at a rapid pace, and with looks of surprise. He was hailed by them with animation, mingled with reverence. Alfonzo ran, and meeting him, embraced him with affection. `God has returned thee in safety, holy father! I began to fear evil had befallen thee!' `I am well. But what means this assemblage?' demanded the hermit, as he gazed round upon the stern faces, and armed hands, of the congregated mountaineers, as they stood grouped beneath the majestic tree, which grew over the road. `Hast thou met no Moorish horse?' asked Gaspar, earnestly. `I beheld a large party of cavalry a mile or more distant, but turned aside into the adjoining wood, and so let them pass.' `That party of horse, father,' said Alfonzo, taking his hand and pressing it with deep emotion, while his brow wore a cloud of dark vengeance, `That party bore away in its midst, my sister Xariffa, as a captive! I was on the mountain, when they came to the hut: but, doubtless, they approached in the night—had been lying in wait in covert till I should depart; for well they knew they would not all return, who came on such an errand. After I reached the mountain, they rushed upon our peaceful home— and I only heard the cry of alarm in time to see them galloping from the hamlet, with Xariffa in their power. I sounded the war-cry, and gathered together such friends as I could, and pursued, but in vain. Here we stopped, and here have we been binding ourselves together, no more to return to our pursuits, till Spain is free of the Moorish yoke! Doubtless, thou hast heard of the thirty days time given us, within which, to become Moslems, or die!' `Yes, my son, I have heard it,' answered the hermit; for I have been in Cordova!' `And come back in safety.' `I wore the dress of a Mufti, and so escaped the vigilance of the Infidel!— There I beheld Abdelasis, and heard with my own ears proclaimed the bondage of my people! I came back to the mountains, my son, to call upon thee to do what I see thou hast resolved to do— make an effort to free Spain from the Infidel! I see by thy bearing in the midst of those who stand around thee, looking up to thy face with hope and confidence, that thou art chosen tbeir leader!' `Alfonso is our chief! We will follow him wherever he will lead!' cried Guiseppo. `We will avenge the wrongs of Spain or perish.' Gaspar now briefly stated what had been done by them, and when he ended, the hermit said with a face beaming with joy— `The hour at length has come for which I have for twenty years fasted and prayed. Heaven has heard the prayer of our bleeding land. For this moment, my son, Alfonso, have I been training my mind and heart. I knew that this hour would come. I knew when it came all men's eyes would be fixed on thee! Thou hast higher ends in view, my son, than mere vengeance against those who have robbed thee of thy beloved sister, for whom I will mourn by and by! I will forget her now, though thou mayest remember her to nerve thy arm if need be. But I know that thou art afflicted in all the afflictions of thy country. I know that thou lookest to her emancipation in thus consecrating thyself to her. Thou standest up among thy people, not the avenger of a sister merely, but with a nobler aim, as the redeemer of thy country! As such I hail thee! Kneel, my son, and receive my blessing, and be consecrated to thy great mission!' The young chief reverently kneeled before the majestic person of the hermit, who laid his hand upon his head, and raising his eyes heavenward, he said in the most solemn manner, while all uncovered their heads, Gaspar and Luis and Guiseppo kneeling a little behind Alfonzo. `I now consecrate and set thee apart, Alfonzo, as the redeemer of thy country; her leader in battle; her defender and saviour, in the name of the most Holy Trinity. May the blessing of the God of armies be upon thee and the spirit of the Lord Jehovah guide thee!' Thus speaking, the holy hermit took from the olds of his garment a small silver cruse of peculiar construction, and from it poured a few drops of fragrant oil upon his head, adding, `Thus I anoint thee the Deliverer of Spain, in the name of the Father Son and Holy Ghost, Amen!' `Amen!' profoundly responded Gaspar; and from every lip echoed the like deep and solemn response.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER IX. THE DEPARTURES. Alfonzo, thus solemnly anointed leader of the Christians, in this incipient movement to overturn the Moorish power, rose to his feet, looking both surprised and serious. The consecration had made a deep impression upon his mind, as well as upon the minds of those who had witnessed it. He was diffident of his influence over others, but still feeling that some one should rise in behalf of Spain, humble as he was, he was willing to give himself, his life, all that he was, to her. The hermit now took from its sheath the dagger of the young chieftain, and going to a helm tree near at hand, he struck from it two branches, one shorter than the other, and stripping them of their bark, he bound them together in the middle with a withe of the bark, thus constructing a rude cross. This he placed in the hands of Alfonzo, and said, `Behold the symbol of salvation. By this, conquer its enemies!' `I will do it, if Heaven give me help,' answered the young chief firmly, as he kissed the cross. `Now give it back to me, my son! I take it from thy hand and bearing it aloft in my own, I go forth to call the mountains and valleys beyond to its defence. I will tell every man that Alfonzo the Destroyer, the Saviour of Spain, hath sent this cross to all who love Christ Jesus, and calls upon them to come to his standard, for the freedom of Spain!' `And I, too, will go forth and rouse the land!' cried Gaspar. `Nay, father, I need thy council and experience,' said Alfonzo. `Keep thou at hand and aid me in bringing to a head this great revolution that has been put upon me. Thou shalt get together at once our friends of the mountains and be their chief until I am ready to lead them. I have work to do, also; for there are men to stir up whom I must see in person! There are men, now slaves, in Cordova who must be told of this, and Spaniards who purchase their homes from spoil with large tribute. These must be told what is at work for Spain. Be thou at the hamlet there to receive and martial all who come to thee. Let each one here who loves Spain give himself to the work. Let them go in every path and defile of the mountains, let them penetrate the gorges of the hills and every nook of the plain. Let others, in such disguises as can best secure their safety, visit the valleys, and the towns in them; and let the good news go from lip to lip to all parts of the land! Within thirty days, if we are true to ourselves, Spain will be free and the Holy Cross take the place of the fallen crescent.' This address was received with deep feeling by the three score hardy mountaineers who heard it, and after some further particular directions, and some cautions to move with secrecy and let not a Moor's ear get the news of the revolt till the day of action arrived. `We must see first my friends,' said Alfonzo, as they were about separating, each on his own mission to his countrymen, `we must first see how many men there are in Spain that wish to throw off the Moslem yoke. We must not move without being sure of conquest. In ten days we can tell how large a force can be depended on when the standard of the Cross shall be lifted up. Each of you will return to me within that time, and you will find me at the rock of St. Paul's. Vol. 2. Sig 3. There shall I lift the Holy Sign of our salvation when the day for its display shall arrive. Till then let us advance cautiously; for the Moor must be taken in a snare, and unprepared to resist his fate. You will each let me know how many can be looked to to join us. Say to all that by the day of St. James, the cross will be lifted up and the blow which is to break or rivet forever the Moorish chains upon us, will be struck; for my friends, few or many, to rally around me, I shall raise the standard and trust in God.' The mountaineers now separated each to the important duty assigned him by their young chief. These men had all been with Alfonzo on his gallant expeditions against the banditti of the Sierras, and loved and honored him. They felt that he was the only man to lead them against their haughty couquerors. Their spirit they resolved to infuse into the souls of all who had not seen and known their chief. The solemn consecration he had received at the hands of the Christian hermit had its impression upon them. After the ceremony, Gaspar had informed them that the cruse used and the oil were the very same with which the last King (for he had seen that ceremony) had been consecrated by the archbishop, for he knew the cruse again and recognised the fragrance of the ointment. Alfonzo, Gaspar, the hermit, Guiseppo and Luis were left standing together beneath the tree, Guiseppo holding by the bridle his Arabian; they remained silently watching the retiring figures of their friends, as they went away in various paths, till all disappeared. Now may Heaven send its blessing with each one of those honest and brave men,' said the hermit. `I foresee the redemption of Spain, my children. The voice which these patriots of the cross will utter shall find an echo in every Spanish heart. The people only want a leader, and they have one of themselves, and one whom nobles will not disdain to follow; for whose name in Spain is wider known for valor than thine, my son.' `I know that father,' cried Gaspar.— `But the boy is so modest he blushes at praise, and I believe thinks no better of himself than as if he had never done anything but tending gazelles all his life. Why, there is not a child in the land that will not answer when asked who cut off the head of El Zegris. It was Alfonzo the Destroyer. What I have heard and seen this day, father, has made me young again. I forget my child in thinking of what has followed her capture. She has become a sacrifice to the freedom of Spain.' `Speak not thus, father! Xariffa is in the hands of the Moor, and nothing can lessen my grief at this reflection. Though I should take Cordova at the head of my countrymen, I should weep my sister lost.' `Thou shoulds think more of thy country than of the maiden, my son. Provi dence hath ordered this, to bring good out of evil. Thou mayest yet recover her in safety. We all loved her. To me she was very dear, and thou seest tears are in my eyes, as well as thine, while I speak of her. But it is not wise to give way to useless grief. To recover her is impossible, till thou shalt take her with thine own hand from the Moslem Harem, which doubtless will become her prison. Give her to the care of the good Saint, and give thy thoughts to thy country.' `I will do so, father. I should not have waited till Xariffa was taken, ere I moved. But I did not feel confidence in myself. I now feel not confidence in myself, but in the justice of the great cause to which I am committed. I will forget Xariffa till the hour comes when I can recover or avenge her.' `Which way now, my son?' `I am going to Cordova.' `It is madness; you will be slain.' `I must do my work. I must not shrink in the outset from danger. I must stir up conspirators within its walls as well as without.' `Thou hast spoken wisely. How do you go?' `I shall go in the disguise of our foes. I must use caution and subtlety. My father has two or three Moorish costumes in the hamlet, and one of these I'll put on. Let us go thither.' `Noble Alfonzo,' said Guesippo, `thou art our chief. This horse becomes thee, not me. I give him to thee.' `Nay, I need him not.' `But thou shalt take him, boy,' cried Gaspar. `If thou art to disguise thyself as a Moor, thou wilt carry it better in the saddle than on foot. Guesippo, the sturdy rogue, needs no such luxury. Mount him?' `Thou, holy father,' said Alfonzo. `No. It is thy place, my son. It is not far to the hamlet, and I will walk thither with Gaspar, and Luis, and Guesippo.' Unable to resist, Alfonzo leaped into the saddle, and sat the noble charger like a prince. `I go with you to Cordova,' said Luis, coming to his stirrup, and speaking earnestly, in a low tone. `I must see and know where my Agata is.' `Thou art needed to get together thy friends, Luis. Thy presence, and sad tale of wrong, will carry with it fire to all who hear thee.' `Wilt thou then seek her out, and learn her fate?' `As faithfully as I will do that of Xariffa.' The young man pressed his hand with gratitude. The whole party now proceeded towards the mountain gorge, in the entrance to which the hamlet was situated. Alfonzo rode on in advance, with the hermit at his side; leaving Gaspar to collect and drive back half a score of scattered kids which were wandering away. When at length, Gaspar reached his door with his companions, they were not a little startled to behold what seemed to the eyes a Moor, come forth and leap into the saddle of the Arabian, which was standing at the door. A smile and wave of the hand from him, to them, caused Gaspar to exclaim, `I had never supposed a Christian would look so much like a Moor. By the mass, boy, thou hadst like to have had my boar-spear flying through the air at your breast.' `Is it a fair disguise friend?' asked Alfonzo, as he rode up to them. `It is needful that I should be wholly free from suspicion. Look at me well.' `Thou art a thorough Saracen,' cried Guesippo. `It is with much ado I could keep my spear's point quiet,' said Gaspar. `If I did not know thee I should swear thou wert a son of the Prophet, like the rest of them.' `Then I will venture on my nightly mission in this disguise,' answered Alfonzo, with that serious, sad air which had not divested his face for a moment, since the capture of Xariffa. `In three days, Gaspar, I will return hither, and tell thee all how the hearts of men beat in Cordova; for there are three thousand artizans in the city, besides five thousand slaves, and many rich Spaniards, who live only at the will of the Moslem, by paying heavy sums every month—a state worse than bondage. I shall move among all these, and know how they will receive the news of a revolution for the over-throw of the power of their masters.' `In the meanwhile,' said Gaspar, `I will be in your place here, to receive all who come with arms to rally around thee!' `Farewell, my son,' said the hermit, coming forth from the hut where he had been with Alfonzo while he dressed; `I go to carry this cross from hamlet to hamlet, and call on every Christian to flock to the standard of Liberty, for the freedom of Spain from the curse of the Crescent! But first I will walk a little way by thy stirrup, for I have a few words to say to thee touching Cordova and thy visit thither!' Luis now came up, and Guiseppo also, and taking an affectionate leave of their young chief, departed on their mission. Gaspar embraced his son with emotion, and commanding him to the grace and protection of all good angels, retired abruptly into the cabin. Alfonzo, dismounting, led his horse down the path, while father Godfrey, walking by his side, said, `Before thou leavest me, my son, I would commend thee to one in Cordova whom thou wilt find ready to receive thee, and to give his gold and his life for Spain! It is the Signor Velez, once high in authority when our old Spanish Kings reigned; but who now lives in outward obscurity. Thou wilt find his house the fourth door from the Mosque of Omar, on the left hand. The outside of the house is mean, but thou wilt find hospitality within. When thou appliest at the door, place this little cross in the hand of the master, and he will receive thee without further question!' As the hermit spoke he placed in the hands of Alfonzo a small silver cross, on which was graven in Hebrew the word `Jehovah.' `Thanks, kind father!' answered Alfonzo. `I needed some place like this to go to! Can I trust him fully with all our plans?' `Yes; thou wilt find him wearing, as thou dost now, a Moorish dress—for outwardly he professes to be a Moslem, but it is only a garb that he may be a spy upon his foes. When shall we see thee again?' `In three days at the farthest, father,' answered Alfonzo; `I shall see who will be with us there, and then return to learn how the people of the Sierras look upon the effort about to be made to throw off the yoke of the Moor.' `I will soon after that be with thee.— Fear not—doubt not, my son! Spain only wants a leader, and thou art he whom God has given to it. Now fare thee well, and the blessing of Heaven go with thee and prosper thee, my son!' The hermit now pressed the hand of his young friend, turned silently away, and with his staff in his hand walked rapidly into the forest northward. Alfonzo looked after him for a moment with a longing farewell glance; and then said with a kindling eye, as he pressed his horse forward,— `Now for Cordova, to plot its down fall! Xariffa, thou shalt be avenged! Spain, thou shalt yet be free!'</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER X. THE YOUNG VINE-DRESSER. The route of our youthful chief lay, for a mile and a half, directly through the heart of a dark forest, crossed in every direction, by paths worn by muleteers and woodmen. There was one tolerably straight path, but narrow, which led from the foot of the mountain, near the hamlet, in the direction of the Guadelquiver. Alfonzo galloped forward, for about a mile, without drawing rein. He was surprised to see two wood-gatherers suddenly fly from the road on seeing him; but, when he recollected that he wore the Moorish attire, he saw the reason of their flight, and sighed at the new proof of the degradation of his countrymen. `It is time Spain rose and asserted her right to be a nation of freemen. We have been slaves so long, we tremble at the sight of a turban. But there shall be a change soon, if my countrymen are true to themselves. It may be that they will refuse to recognise my claim to be their leader. But if one among them will stand up and raise the standard of the cross, I will follow him. But there seems no one ready; all my friends look to me. Even my father turns to me and bids me take the lead. It is true I have done something to aid my countrymen; and it is true that in Xariffa's capture, I have endured an outrage, that seems to call on me to act whether others move or not and this I will do. I know not what the holy hermit meant by pouring that cruice of fragrant oil upon my head. How solemnly it was done. There seemed to be a deep meaning in it: gladly would I have asked him, but I feared he would think I thought too much upon the circumstance. There was, doubtless, some sacred virtue in the ointment. I do, indeed, feel that I am set apart for this great work: and will the thousands of Spain, now in bondage, rise at my call upon them? Will Spain consent to be made free by the hands of a peasant? The nobles may mock, but the peasantry will follow me, and so if I achieve liberty for these I am content. There is the road which turns off towards the Emir's tower. I will take it on my way, and know what hath become of Genilla. Her nation will protect her from the outrages which Christian maidens suffer. But I would know if she is returned in safety from Cordova.' He had ridden but a few rods in the new path he had taken, when he beheld before him two Moorish vine-dressers, driving an ass laden with grapes in panniers. He felt that now his disguise would have a fair test, without much danger, even should it fail, as he was well armed with daggers and a scymetar, while they carried only their staves sharpened with an iron pike, the usual arms of both the Moorish and Spanish peasantry. As he rode towards them, he saw them commence driving and pushing the ass out to one side of the path, to give room for him to ride by, their harsh cries and blows making the forest echo again. His costume was that of a Moorish officer, of the rank of a captain, and as to it he had added a green silk turban—the sacred color of the Prophet—taken from one of his former Moorish prisoners, he carried with him authority and power. The two men got their ass to one side of the way, and there held him, as Alfonzo rode by. They both made a profound salaam with their faces to the ground as he passed. To be sure that they saw him well, he reined up, and asked in good Arabic, for the language of their conquerors was mostly spoken by the men of Spain, their proud conquerors disdaining to learn the tongue of the vanquished. `Hast thou seen a party of Zenetan horse pass through the forest?' `Three hours ago, most noble Effendi,' answered one of the Moors. `Hah! How large a force?' `About sixty horsemen; and they had a captive Christian lady with them!' `Did they ride on to Cordova?' `Yes, most excellent Effendi; but it was not on this road, but by the one to the West.' Satisfied that he might now safely venture into Cordova, Alfonzo left them with the indifference of manner characteristic of the Moor, who never thanks an inferior, and galloped rapidly forward in the direction of the Emir's tower. He soon came in sight of its lofty, ruinous hattlements over-topping the trees, and in a few minutes afterwards reined cautiously up under the wall; for he did not care to come suddenly or unnecessarily upon any Moors, who might chance to be about the tower, or upon Ben Osmin himself, if he should be at home.— The tower, as we have said, stood upon a shoulder of a low projecting point of the Sierra, and covered the whole rock, save a narrow path-way around the base, which led to a level, green platform in the rear, half an acre in extent, and overhung by the mountain. In this sheltered elevation, upon a level with the wall of the tower, stood, with its front to the latter, the little vine-trellised cottage of Ben Osmin, the retired Moorish captain of the sea. Up this path, just described, Alfonzo slowly rode, carefully watching for the appearance of any one. But he reached the top of the platform and came in sight of the Kasah, without seeing any one. Here he dismounted, and led his horse into the area of the tower, to drink at a pool which he saw there, resolving afterwards to enter the dwelling; for he knew that there dwelt there with Ben Osmin and his daughter, an old Moorish woman as house-keeper, who was partly blind and a cripple, but nevertheless, as Ben Osmin said of her to his friends, a notable body to take care of a house, and wait on 'nilla. He entered the court of the tower, and dismounted. The day being hot, and all still around, the young chief removed from his head his ample green turban, and laid it upon a stone, displaying upon his brow a sort of low helmet, or coronet of singular beauty, being eight sided, and made of fine steel, inlaid with gold. He then threw aside his long white muslin Moorish robe, and appeared clad in a handsome surcoat of mail, with a crimson sash about his waist, and hanging from a strap across his shoulder, appeared the gigantic scymetar of the Ethiop, whom he had slain in the fortress of El Zegris. This costume had been given him in the hut by the hermit, who had taken it from a box in Xariffa's apartment where he said he had long kept it, for this very purpose, and insisted on his wearing both the helmet and the cuirass, beneath his Moorish robes— `For,' said he, `thou art a leader, and thou shouldest wear armour becoming a chief; and the armour will protect thy life if thou art assailed. Besides, I have my reasons why thou shouldest wear it when thou comest to lead the Christian host!' `Then I will put it on, not now, father,' answered Alfenzo. `Now, my son is the time to put it on! Thou mayest be called suddenly from Cordova, and to throw off thy Moorish dress to take the lead in the revolt. I would have thee appear well. Wear these by my command!' `I obey!' answered Alfonzo, and put ting them on he was surprised how well they fitted him, as if made for him!' `Said I not I kept them for thee, my son,' answered the Monk with a proud and gratified smile. `Yet they were not made for thee! But now put on thy Moorish garb. I would not Gaspar should see thee in this guise just now. How noble thy bearing. I love to gaze on thee as thou now appearest! I could almost kneel to thee, my son! But not now, not now! First break in pieces the chains of thy country!' `I must have a sword becoming such brave armour as this, father! I see none that will serve me but this of the Ethiop. It is of Damascus steel, and tempered finely. It is well worthy of a prince, much less a peasant. I will bind it on, for I shall need it, if Spain comes to the rescue of her altars and her homes, as I believe she will!' `Believe it, my son! If the land hears thee not because thou art of humble birth, I will give thee a talisman that will draw every heart unto thee! Quickly on with thy turban and robe, for I hear the footsteps and voice of Gaspar approaching! In a few moments the knightly looking young man was completely transformed into a Saracen, in turban and bernish. `Now, holy father,' said Alfonzo, going out to mount his horse, `I leave with thee my gazelles, and especially this kid of Xariffa, who so plaintively misses his mistress. The herd-boy will look to them, but while thou art here see to him that he neglects them not; for this is to be thy home!' The next instant he was in his saddle, and met Gaspar and his friends, as we have seen. Having now laid aside his warm Moorish costume in the lonely court of the tower, to resume again when he should remount his horse, he led the noble animal towards the pool to let him drink, and at the same time to cool his own brow and hands. He came to the pool which was at the end of a low wall that intersected the tower, and was about to let him drink, when a young man, habited in the ordinary garb of a Moorish mountaineer, with a short wolf-knife in his belt, came suddenly out from the wall and stood before him, gazing into his face with curiosity and fearless surprise. Alfonzo instantly recognised him and called him by his name. `What, art thou here, Athir?' `And am I not then mistaken?' cried the young man, with a countenance brightening with pleasure. `I knew that I could not be deceived in my benefactor's face, even under a knight's helm!' `What art thou doing here? And lo! this water in the pool is crimson! My horse snuffs it and revolts at it!' cried Alfonzo, in the same breath in which he questioned him; and pointing to the pool, he looked steadily in his face, and asked, `Hast thou slain any man? Hast thou cast a Christian in here to conceal the deed of blood, Moor? Speak!' The youth stood up and looked him firmly and unwaveringly in the face, and with a noble air of innocence answered, `No, I have not slain a Christian. For thy sake, I am their friend! The body that lies there is the body of a Moslem!' `And wherefore did you quarrel?' `He was a Moor who had followed El Zegris when thou didst save my life and gave it to me when I looked only for death at thy hands!' `I pitled thy youth, Athir. I warred only with El Zegris and his hardy men of war!' `I have not forgotten thy mercy.— How thou didst take me to the good hermit's cave, give him charge to heal my wound; and then, when I recovered, you suffered me to depart in peace. For this thy image has been daily before me; and for this I would lose my life to serve thee. This robber Moor came hither, for I have of late been hired by Ben Osmin to help him in his vineyard, and would have got me to join him by threats to show him the cave of the hermit; for he said men had told him that there was much Christian gold concealed in the cell of the hermit, and he meant to plunder it and carry it away!' `The father hath but a cross and a cup of silver! He is poor, save in the riches of virtue, Athir!' `So I told the Moor; but he would not believe me. He said he would go alone and would rob the hermit though he had to slay him. So he would have left me; but I held him, when he aimed a stroke at me with his scymetar. I wrested it from him and slew him and cast his body into the pool. Thus have I saved the life of the venerable Christian who healed me and sent me away in peace, though an enemy to his race!' `Thou hast done a good deed, Athir,' said Alfonzo to the youth, who had been a page to El Zegris and whose life he had spared when he first attacked and drove the robber-chief from the mountains. Athir had received a wound in the conflict and would have been slain by one of Alfonzo's band but for his interposition. He took him with him to the cell of father Godfrey, and when he was healed sent him home to Cordova, where Athir told him he had a mother and sister living. But there he met again with El Zegris, who would have forced him into his service, but Athir fled and became a vine-dresser in the valley, and finally had been hired by Ben Osmin to aid him in dressing his vineyard.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XI. THE YOUTHFUL MOOR. The young Moor having related to Alfonzo the events as they have just been given, and received his commendation for what he had done in thus destroying a dangerous enemy of the father Godfrey, said, `Though the pool is crimsoned with the robber's blood, I will lead the horse where he can find water. There is a fountain behind the kasah that flows from the rock.' Alfonzo knew well the fountain. It was there he had his last meeting with Genilla the evening previous to her departure for Cordova with her father, contrary to her lover's wishes; for Alfonzo had no wish to place her in the way of the lawless young Saracen cavaliers, and so let her see that there were good looking young men in the world besides himself. `You may take him there, Athir.— Does Ben Osmin yet linger in the city?' `Yes, Effendi. He left, it is now the third day, with the fair Genilla his daughter, the captain riding his brown ass gaily caparisoned, and Genilla mounted behind him upon a pillion. They went with the sun-rising.' `And have you heard from them?' asked Alfonzo, as he walked with him towards the trough, which was a hollow stone beneath the fountain. `Not a word. They were to go to the house of Ben Habib, the turban-maker, who I believe is a cousin of Ben Osmin; at least they are great friends.' `Dost thou know on what street in Cordova this Ben Habib lives?' inquired Alfonzo, as they stopped at the fountain and let the horse drink of the refreshing water as it gushed alive from the rock. `It is the street known as the street of the gate of Mecca. Thou wilt know the place by the sign of a red turban.' `I thank thee—I will find it.' `Thou art not going into Cordova?' exclaimed Athir with surprise. `Yes.' `Thou wilt be slain—Cordova is filled with thy enemies!' `I know it.' `Go not, my lord; do not put thyself in the way of death! For my sake remain, and rush not upon the scymetars of my countrymen!' `Dost thou then feel such interest in me, Athir?' said Alfonzo, regarding him keenly. `Do I?—Thou art dearer to me than any one! Art thou not the saviour of my life?—do I not live by thee?—do I not stand here for thee? I am thine— not my own; and dost thou ask me if I love thee?' `This is gratitude, indeed!' exclaimed Alfonzo, as he raised the youth from his knees, upon which he had fallen as he spoke, bowing his head upon his hand, as if grieved that his grateful affection for the preserver of his life should for a moment be questioned. `I will trust thee!' `Thou shouldst do it, my lord; I slew a Moor, my own countryman, because he would have wronged the hermit, thy friend! I would slay myself if I thought that one throb of my heart could beat false to thee. Go not to Cordova!' `Wilt thou go with me?' `I will if thou wilt let me—I will be thy faithful shadow. If thou goest to Cordova, I will be by thy side to protect thee—to die with thee! But go not thither, my lord!' `I must;—thou shalt go also.' `Allah be praised!' `Listen, Athir: I believe that you love me, and can be trusted.' `Thou shalt prove me!' answered the youth with enthusiasm. `But thou art a Moslem—I a Christian,—canst thou serve me, and forget both?' `I can.' `Then listen: my sister Xariffa, as beautiful and good as an angel of Paradise, and whom you saw once with me in the hermit's cell, has this day been torn from my home by a party of sixty Zenetan horse, the household cavalry of Abdelasis.' `May Allah curse them!' cried the Moor with flashing eyes. `I remember her, my lord: fair as a houri. Her gentle smile warmed my breast. Has the Zenetan horse become banditti?' `I know not, unless they were sent by Abdelasis for this special capture.' This indeed had at last come to be Alfonzo's opinion, the more his mind dwelt upon the subject. In the first place, the Zenetan cavalry, which were the finest horsemen and best soldiers in Barbary, and had always constituted the royal body-guard of Emir and Caliph, had made this capture. They had no sooner accomplished it than they galloped back to Cordova with their prize. He recollected, too, that his sister had said that she had seen him asleep: and, recalling the words he had heard fall from his lips when he waked, he believed that he had seen her. This belief now led him to suspect his agency in her capture. `I am going into the city in hopes to find my sister,' added Alfonzo, who did not see fit to unfold to him all his motives in visiting Cordova. `I am willing to confide in thee for a companion, knowing well that I may trust my life in thy hands.' `My lord, thou knowest that I would die to save thine.' `Thou shalt then go with me, and perhaps thou mayest serve me. Ben Osmin's vineyard will not suffer for thy absence a day or two, and doubtless he will be at home to-night or to-morrow.' `I will send a man who dwells in the valley a mile hence to look after it,' answered Athir with enthusiasm. `I am happy to know thou wilt let me go with thee. I will serve thee. I will try and rescue Xariffa for thee. I will do whatsoever thou biddest me do—only that I may be with thee.' `Wilt thou keep sacredly the secret that I am a Christian?' `I will, my lord. But men will see that thou art one.' `True, if I wear this garb; but I am not going into Cordova in this costume. Come with me, Athir, and I will show thee what I shall wear as a protection against discovery.' Thus speaking, Alfonzo led his horse, and conducted the Moorish youth back to the ruin, within which he pointed out to him, lying upon a rock, the Moslem turban and bernish which he had left there. He put them on, and then, turning to the surprised youth, said, `Am I not safe under this disguise, even in Cordova?' `Thou art, my lord. I should believe thee none other than a Moorish officer of one of the Emir's household.' `So I would be considered. Thou must address me as Ali Ahmet.' `I will not forget it, my lord.' `Then thou shalt go with me; but I ride. Thou canst not keep up with me. But I can adapt the pace of my horse to thine.' `I am swift of foot as a deer, my lord. I will run by thy side.' `It is, then, that I go into Cordova as a Moorish officer, Ali Ahmet, and thou my—my—what shall I say—companion? —lieutenant?—' `Servant, my lord.' `Nay, I am but a peasant. I know no slaves. Yet be it so for the present.' Alfonzo now glanced at the sun, and seeing that it was but an hour high, he resolved to proceed without delay to Cordova, as he knew the gates would be shut at sun-down. He therefore bade Athir take his staff and come with him. `I must go in and get my kaftan and turban, my lord,' answered the young man; and, going into the house, after a few minutes' absence, he returned with a white lawn turban folded about his brows, and a dark brown kaftan that reached to his knees, and at the waist was confined by a leathern belt, in which was stuck a pruning-knife. Sandals were bound upon his feet, and in his hand he grasped a stout staff, shod with sharp-pointed steel. `I am ready, my lord,' he said, in a frank, cheerful tone, as if he was happy to be in the way of showing his gratitude to his benefactor. `There is yet one good hour left for us to reach the gates before they close. The distance is still more than two leagues. Canst thou go so fast?' `I could run it in much less time, my lord,' answered the youth with animation, as together they descended the steep path which wound round the front of the tower. At length they found themselves in the open road that crossed the valley of the Guadalquivir. For the first mile their path lay through the bosom of the forest that everywhere belted the region where the sierra fell into the plain. Alfonzo rode at an easy pace through the wood, the youthful Moor striding at his horse's head with an agile and easy air. `Thou art used to exercising thy limbs, Athir. One would take thee for a Christian mountaineer. It would put me to task to keep pace with thee.' `I have been a mountaineer, senor,' answered the Moor. `In Barbary, where I was born, are ranges of lofty mountains; and on one of these, for centuries, lived my fathers, who were herdsmen and hunters. From a boy, till I could draw a bow, I was reared among the hills. But four years ago I left Barbary in the train of Algezir the Emir, to seek my fortune in this fair land, which our songs said flowed with golden rivers, and over which arched skies of sapphire. `But friendly I was hardly served in the Emir's household, who had made me his page, and one day being struck by a Eunuch, I slew him and fled to the mountains here. El Zegris was then in the height of his power as a robber chief, and in my wanderings I came upon his strong-hold. He made me a prisoner, but afterwards took me into his service. When, at length, he was driven from his fortresses by you, my brave lord, I fell into your hands, and you spared my life, which life is now yours!' `How came you to leave Barbary, Athir? Why not remain in your mountains of the Moor, as I think they are called, with thy fathers?' `Thou shalt know, senor,' answered Athir, after a moment's hesitation, and colouring deeply. `I will speak of it to thee, my lord. My father was poor, but still he had in his veins princely blood. Still we were very poor and I tended my father's goats, our only subsistence!' `Then we are brethren in occupation, Athir!' `I shall never be higher than I am— thou wilt be great, and men will yet honor thee greatly, signor! The chief of our tribe had a fair daughter, Nube, sixteen years of age, with eyes like twin stars shining at midnight, and a face as beautiful as an angel's. I loved her afar off, and worshipped her in my heart.— She discovered, I know not how, that I loved her, and we met, and together wandering by the soft moonlight, told our loves and were happy. But, at length, the proud chief was told that his beautiful daughter was loved by the son of one of his herdsmen. He called her, and she confessed it; and by a faithful slave sent me word to fly. I obeyed, though with a sad heart at leaving her forever! It was thus that I came to Spain!' `And hast thou not heard from the fair Arabian girl? Art thou ignorant of her fate?' asked Alfonzo with deep interest in his simple story. `I know nothing, senor,' answered the youth, sadly. `I am ignorant whether she lives or fell a victim to her father's anger!' `I sympathise with thee, Athir! But see! what comes here?' he suddenly exclaimed, as a cloud of dust rose in the valley before them along a cross road that led from the upper or western extremity of the valley. It rolled along the line of the road which intersected theirs, but the persons were concealed by the hedge rows and gardens between; for our two travellers were now riding in the open valley, having left the forest some distance behind them. About their road, as they went, the country was beautiful with cottages, villages with white towers, or here and there a minaret peeping out above the trees; with gardens and vineyards, and pleasant meadows chequered with groves. There were two principal roads which wound through the valley, one of which they were now on, and which led directly to Cordova, and the other intersected it from the east, and was that along which rolled the cloud of dust which had called Alfonzo's attention. It is a troop, my lord, I see the tops of their lances glancing above the hedges and dust,' said Athir. `Let us turn aside.' `No, we are too nigh them now. If I expect to be admitted into Cordova as a Moor, I must not fear a party of Moorish horse in the high way. I will keep on, trusting in my disguise. Walk with thy hand upon my horse, Athir, as if thou wert a slave.' `My lord, feign thyself deaf, and let me answer for thee, if thou art questioned.' `If it will please thee, Athir, I will do so; for I have too much at stake to risk my liberty lightly.'</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XII. THE SARACEN CAVALRY. The cloud of moving dust now suddenly resolved itself, as they entered the road in which Alfonzo travelled, into a brilliant corps of cavalry, crossing the valley at full speed. Their number was not less than eighty. Upon entering the road they wheeled to the left and advanced at the same pace towards Cordova, as Athir thought, without seeing him or his master, as he chose to term Alfonzo. `This is a good oversight for us, my lord. They might have been too inquisitive had they discovered you and chose to wait for us to join them.' `See! Three of them in the rear have suddenly turned their horses' heads and gallop back. They have seen us. They wave their scymetars as they spur on.' `Now, my lord, may Allah keep thee,' said Athir, with much alarm. `Fear not, Athir. I will manage them. They come in hostile attitudes; but they know not whether I am foe or friend.— Even the Moors fear each other since this revolution, which has broken up so many factions. Now keep thee quiet, and let us move gently on and meet them.' The three horsemen, glittering in silks and polished steel harness, with gleaming scymetars, came up like the wind, abreast; but as they came nigh Alfonzo, seeing that he betrayed neither fear nor hostility, they reined up, and trotting gently along, met him and saluted him. `Allah be with thee, brother,' said the foremost. `Allah be thy guide also, brother,' answered Alfonzo, in spite of the appealing glance of the faithful Athir, who would have replied in his stead. `Comest thou far on this road?' asked the Saracen cavalier. `Not many miles, brother. What band is this before me?' `It is a party of the Caliph's guard, as thou seest I am by my apparel and turban. We have been to the mountains on the east of the valley to attack a party of Algezir's men, who had thrown themselves into a castle there.' `I thought all the true followers had submitted to Abdelasis,' said Alfonzo. `All but these men. They hoped, by fortifying themselves there, to defy the Caliph, and by and by getting the disaffected, the robbers and renegades to their standard, avenge one day their chief's death.' `What leader had they?' `Who but El Zegris, the Eblis of all mischief in Andalusia,' answered the officer with a frown. `El Zegris!' exclaimed Alfonzo and Athir in the same breath. `Yes. Your slave seems to speak as if he knew him.' `He was once his prisoner,' answered Alfonzo. `And did you attack the castle?' `Yes; but without success. The one-handed chief was everywhere inspiring his men, and we had to retire; but we are only returning to Cordova for a reinforcement. If that brave Christian, Alfonzo the mountaineer, had slain this great robber instead of only cutting off his hand, he would have done us and all Spain good service.' `He spared him, because he thought it would be a greater punishment to such a man—so men say,' answered Alfonzo. `Punishment, indeed! It has been but little to him; for he lashes his sword to his club-wrist as if with bonds of iron, and thus wields it with a power that no man can withstand. It is a terrible steel arm and fatal to all that come within its sweep.' `It is to be regretted, since this is so, that he was not killed out-right. `Allah be praised! we shall not want a force to send against him; now Abdelasis reigns. He hates El Zegris, for some early encounter they have had: and he will give us troops enough to destroy him.' `Who is chief of this party to which you belong?' asked Alfonzo. `It is Aben Haphel, a nephew, thou knowest, of Taric. Wilt thou ride on?' `I ride slow to accommodate my slave,' answed Anfonzo; for while they had been conversing they had been riding along, the horseman being on Alfonzo's right, while his two companions, who were inferior in rank, rode in the rear. `There are three empty saddles in the party, their riders having been slain. Thy slave shall ride one, and so make it easier for him and the soldiers who are leading them. Go forward, Hammel, and bring hither from the troop one of the led horses.' The soldier gallopped on ahead after the body of cavalry, and soon coming up with them, took a richly caparisoned steed by the bridle, with which a Moor was leading him, and returning, met the officer and Alfonzo. Athir leapt lightly into the saddle, and falling back in the rear of all, as he knew it became him to do, as a `slave,' he saw, not without alarm, Alfonzo and the officer prepare to gallop on and overtake the troop. `You had better,' said the officer, `enter the gates with us, for they will without doubt be closed when we get to them; and to you alone they would not be opened.' `You are very courteous, Effendi,' answered Alfonzo. `I will avail myself of the privilege.' `Come you from the north, brother?' asked the officer. `As I said, not far. But a few miles.' `How do the Christians, if thou hast spoken with any, like the accession of Abdelasis?' `They little heed the changes in our government, brother. It is the same to them who rules: a slave, you know has no choice in masters.' `True. But they should see in this new government of Abdelasis that the power of our people is to increase and become greater than before; and with our greatness they must see that they will fall lower still.' `They see it. But they have been broken down by a score of years of slavery to the—to us, and have little heed how things now go. May I ask who thou art brother?' `I am Ali Ben Sarac, brother to Ibrahim, who is the Reis Effendi under the new Caliph,' answered the youthful officer; and I am second in command of the troops to which we are now so near. Thy name and rank?' `Ali Ahmet, a captain, but not in service now.' `Dost thou go to Cordova to seek service with Abdelasis?' `I may see the Prince; but I fear he would not grant me a place, such as would please me!' `Fear not. He means to call around his person all the bravest men in Spain. Ibrahim told me that he would not hesitate to make an officer of rank even of the valiant Christian Alfonzo, if he could induce him to take service with him. But they say this Chief is as proud as he is poor; and there is little hope that Abdelasis will ever get his services otherwise than by making him his slave.' `The Christians have little reason to love their conquerors.' `That is true, brother. But we shall have them all good Mussulmen soon. Thou hast heard of the great Decree of the new Caliph? which calls on Christians to register their names before him ere thirty days expire.' `Yes, I have heard it.' `Those who, after registering their names, shall refuse to worship in the Mosque Omar, are to have their left ear clipped, the forefinger of the right hand cut off, and to be sold in the bazanrs to the highest bidder. By Allah, these Christians are so stubborn that I see we shall be overrun with slaves; every artisan will be as rich as an Emir.' `Think you the Christians will come in to undergo this degradation?' asked Alfonzo, with an effort repressing the exhibition of the emotions to which this conversation gave rise. `What help have they? Abdelasis has all the power in the land. He has consolidated the empire. He has no rivals —no factions to contend with—when this El Zegris is slain or taken, as he will soon be. The Caliph can, therefore, fill the mountains and valleys of Spain with his soldiers. With sword and fire they can kill and destroy all who resist. Unless the Christians wish to be exterminated, they will not resist the decree!' `You believe, then, that they will come in to be registered?' `To a man.' `Think you Alfonzo the mountaineer will come too?' `No, he will stay away! If he comes, he is not the man that I suppose him to be. He will no doubt fly to the fortresses of the mountains with others as bold as himself, and there defy the soldiers of the Caliph. I would give the richest diamond on the crescent of the Caliph, were it mine, to see this Alfonzo!' `Possibly he may come into Cordova and be registered!' `Should he do so, he will hardly leave it again. Abdelasis would give much to hold him in his hands.' `Think you he will go so far as to slit the ears and cut off the fingers of all who, after having registered their names, shall refuse to offer sacrifice in the Mosque?' `There is no doubt of it. He means to make Spain a Moslem Empire. There shall not, he says, exist in Spain two nations, and one of these Christians. The only distinction shall be master and slave; and the Christian, if he refuses to become a follower of the Prophet, shall be made a bondman. But here we are up with my troop!' `It is a gallant company. Some of your people, I see, are wounded, by the blood-stained bandages they wear?' `Yes; we lost four killed, and have seven wounded, but not badly. The Zegris defended his castle bravely. To-morrow, ere the sun-set, we shall once more storm his defences. It will take four hundred men to do it. I shall ask Abdelasis to give me command of the division; and if thou choosest to give thy scymetar something to do, thou shalt have an honorable place in my troop!' `Thanks, Effendi. I go to Cordova only on matter of business, and for the present care not to engage in any expeditions of warfare. I thank thee, nevertheless, for thy courteous offer. You said right that I should hardly get to the gate before sun-set. The sun is now close to the horizon, and we are yet full two miles distant from the walls. To go in with thy company will be a privilege; for, not having any friends in the valley, I should not care to lodge in the caravansera outside the gate, when, at such a stirring time as this, many lawless bands must be strolling about the suburbs!' The Moorish cavalry to which Alfonzo had now attached himself, and very gladly too, as affording him a way of entering the city unquestioned, had now got within full view of the city, which stood in all its oriental splendor upon the banks of the Guadalquivir—a pile of palaces, mosques, domes and crowning minarets, which reflected back with the brilliancy of needles of polished gold, the setting sun. The groves of palm that grew near the walls, the lofty walls themselves, with their bastions and towers, the noble river flowing around and half-embracing them, with the soft, mellow, roseate tint of the atmosphere, hanging like a veil over all, presented to the eye of the young gazelle-keeper, as he rode along the road by the side of the Moorish lieutenant, a scene that delighted and enchanted him. As they drew nearer, their road lay amid a vale of gardens, the fragrance from which loaded the air, and almost oppressed the senses, Birds sang in the orange groves, and flew from spray to spray above the heads of the prancing horsemen, like brilliant flowers on the wing. They passed the open gates of Moorish villas, where, upon rich mats, sat the master of the house, surrounded by his family, listening to music, or being entertained with the graceful motions of the Xeri, or Arabian dancing-girls.— They passed horsemen and mulattoes, and labourers, hurrying homeward, ere night should set in, and were passed by riders at full speed, who feared they should not reach the city in time, before the closing of the gates: but the commander of the troop neither mended his pace, nor betrayed anxiety; as he knew that the gates, though shut, would be thrown open to him, as soon as he should appear before them.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XIII. THE STREETS OF CORDOVA. About half a mile from the walls, the road along which the party of horsemen was in motion struck the broad river, and turned city-ward along its banks.— The shades of evening were already deepening the hue of the heavens, when they came te the foot of the slight ascent, which led up to the principal gate. It was already closed, and about it was gathered some score of travellers of all ranks and pursuits, who had been shut out for the night. Among them were two Hadji or pilgrims, as their garb showed. One of them was a man of tall appearance, with an air that was singularly noble, though his dress was coarse, and his feet were bare. The other was more youthful, slighter in person, and seemed to retire from the observation of the Moorish captain, as the elder Hadji stepped forth and saluted him. `My lord,' said the Hedji, extending his arm towards the leader of the corps, as he rode up and waved his hand to the officer of the gate, who stood upon its summit, to admit him and his troop. `Well, holy pilgrim from the tomb of the prophet, what wouldst thou?' `Permission to enter under thy protection. We have travelled far a-foot, and need repose, and were but a minute too late.' `Thou hast asked what I will gladly grant thee, pilgrim. Touch my scyme-tar, and give it power against the Infidel!' The pilgrim laid his hand upon the naked blade for a moment and murmured a few words, kissed it, and then stood back. `My lord, wilt thou permit me also to go in?' cried a merchant of Catalan, holding the bridle of his laden mule as he humbly approached the chief. `I have rich wares in my packs, and I am told robbers are abroad.' `What wilt thou pay me, merchant?' asked the haughty Moslem officer, extending his open palm. `I am very poor, my lord—I can give thee but little.' `Poor! didst thou not but now say thy packs were filled with rich goods. Thou art a liar, and deservest the bastinado. Give me a gold moid for suffering thee to go in with me.' `There it is, my lord Effendi,' answered the merchant, cheerfully taking the coin from his pouch, and laying it upon the palm of the officer's hand. `Good! Now pay me two gold sheken for thy lie!' `Oh, my lord!' `Not a word!—Be quick, for you delay the captain of the gate, who waits for me to go through.' `There it is, my lord.' `Two! I said not one,' `There, my lord.' `Hold: I have not done with thee yet. Pay me three golden tekel for not taking thy goods from thee, for lying to an officer of the Caliph!' `Allah be merciful!' ejaculated the poor merchant; `I shall be robbed!' and he began to count the gold with trembling fingers. `Dost thou call me a robber?' Make it five tekel, rogue of a merchant.— Hesitate, and I will take off thy head!' The merchant paid the gold, and then with misgiving stepped back:—but the commander had done with him. Two or three others, who had pressed forward for permission to enter, on seeing these proceedings, drew back in silence, preferring to run the risk of being plundered by the robbers without, than the certainty of being robbed at the gate. The Moorish officer now spurred forward and galloped through the arch gate-way between files of soldiers, who saluted him as he went by. Alfonzo passed in with Ali-ben-Sarac, the friendly lieutenant who rode in the rear of the troop; and close behind him galloped Athir; after these came the Catalan merchant, and the two Hadjii, and one or two others. The gates were then closed by a loud command from the captain of the guard, and Alfonzo found himself within the city of his foes, without hope of escape, save by his address, courage, and the excellency of his disguise. `Which way do you ride?' asked Aliben-Sarac, as they rode swiftly up the main street which led from the gate to the great square of the Mosque of Omar. `I shall go to some caravansera,' answered Alfonzo. `I thank thee for thy courtesy to me, a stranger.' `No Moor who wears the green turban is a stranger to a true follower of the Prophet, brother. Besides, did I not see by thy air and bearing that thou wert of good birth and rank. If thou wilt ride to the Caliph's palace I will insure thee a good reception from Abdelasis, if thou wilt take service with him. Under what Emir hast thou served as captain?' `Under none of late;—as I said, I am now a private citizen. I must, therefore, beg leave to decline your kind invitation. I will now bid thee good night, and pray that to-morrow El Zegris may fall into thy hands. Athir, dismount and give the soldier by thee the horse he has given thee to ride so long.' Athir obeyed, throwing the rein to the Moor and taking Alfonzo's horse by the bit; for he had reined up, seeing that they had come to a cross street, down which he thought it best to turn to get rid of going to the palace with the kindly-disposed Ali Sarac. `Then if thou goest no farther, Allah take thee in his keeping, noble brother!' answered Ali Sarac, bowing with courtesy, and laying his hand upon his heart. The next moment he was dashing after his troop at full speed, followed by his two attendants, one of whom led the horse which had so well accommodated Athir. Alfonzo turned aside from the street of the gate into another narrower and obscure, bordered by low stone houses with here and there an arch over-topped by a palm, leading into the court-yard of some secluded mansion. There were but few persons in the streets, and these standing about the door-ways. Now and then two or three of the Moorish soldiers were met lounging along, but they paid no heed to the rider and his slave. The twilight was already deepening into night, and Alfonzo saw that it would be necessary for him to find the house of Senor Velez to whom the hermit had recommended him. `Dost thou know this street we are in, Athir?' he asked of the young Moor who walked at his horse's head. `It is the street El Tarif, my lord! It leads in the direction of the old palace of Algezir!' `I would seek the street which leads past the Mosque of Omar, the fourth door therefrom.' `We shall have then to leave this one and go to the left, my lord, and take three turnings to bring us to the Mosque, unless we turn back and approach it by the street of the gate.' `No, we will go this way, if it be the safest.' `There is less danger of meeting a guard here. If you cross the great square you will be challenged, now that it is dark.' `Then let us go on and at good speed, Athir! I leave my guidance to thee, for I am not familiar with the city.' `I know it well, my lord. I lived here in service with Algezir many months ere I slew the Eunuch and fled to the mountains. Vol. 2. Sig 4. Dost thou see this high wall which we are passing on our left, with the trees over-topping it and loading the air with the perfume of their flowers?' `I see it, and the top of a noble edifice within the garden.' `This palace was the favorite residence of the Caliph Musa, whose assassination brought all the evils upon Cordova that have since befallen it. It is still a fair palace.' `And what lofty tower is this on the corner beyond, rising side by side with that lofty palm, which seems to wish to rival its height?' `That is called the Vizier's tower. From it the conqueror Taric received his conquest and hung the severed banner of the prophet. It is now used as a prison, my lord. Thou, seest that a guard is pacing to and fro before it now. Let us pass rapidly by!' `Not so, Athir. It were safer to be unconcerned,' answered Alfonzo. As he rode past the Moorish sentinel gazed at them fixedly, but remained silent and let them move on without hinderance. They now came to the corner or another street, broader and handsomer, with stately edifices on either side and shaded with rows of lime trees. Minarets pierced the sky above their heads, and a vast dome lifted its huge bulk like a mountain into the air. `That is the Mosque of Omar,' said Athir. `We will go down this narrow street and come to it on the west side; by this means we shall avoid the public square in front of it, where, from the sounds of trumpets and martial music which we hear, we shall be likely to fall in with the body guard of the Caliph. Safe as your disguise is, my lord, you cannot be too cautious.' `I will be as careful, my brave and faithful friend, as thou couldst wish to have me; for more than my own life and liberty hangs upon my safety. Ha, here seems to be a broil in the street before us.' `I hear the shouts. They are beating a Christian slave!' `Yes, I now hear their epithets of `Christian dog' and `accursed Nazarine.' And I hear the lashes, too, upon the poor slaves back!' said Alfonzo, who could scarcely restrain the impulse to gallop forward and interpose to save the victim of oppression whom he heard pleading piteously in the name of the Virgin for life! But he felt that he owed as much to his own self-preservation as he did to humanity. `My poor countryman!' he sighed. `Let us pass another way, my lord,' said Athir, who found that Alfonzo would be tempted to expose himself in an effort to rescue the Christian. `No. Thou canst trust me, Athir. I will not interpose. Heaven, in its grace, soon vouchsafe to me the time when I may!' he added fervently. They now came up with the scene of cruelty and suffering. `What is this?' asken Athir of a man who stood by with a trowel in his hand, and in the garb of a mason. `It is a Christian slave being bastinadoed, as thou seest,' answered the Moor, pointing to a man half naked, kneeling, with his arms bound around a post, while the soles of his feet were held up-turned by a cord fastened to them, and grasped by two Moslem boys. A man, with the sleeves of his bernish rolled back to his shoulder, was armed with a nine-lashed whip, with which, at intervals of about a quarter of a minute, he would inflict severe blows upon the exposed soles. At every stroke of the cutting thongs the man would utter a piercing shriek, which would be mocked by the jeering Infidels around. The sight made the bosom of Alfonzo burn. `What has he done?' demanded Athir of the man with the trowel. `He is the slave of the man who is punishing him—that is enough, Allah be praised,' answered the man; and he turned away and imitated with cruel precision another of the piercing cries which the sufferer uttered. `Save me, for Jesu's sake,' cried the poor man. `Call on Allah!' shouted the crowd. `Yes, call on Allah, slave, and say that God is God, and Mahomet is his Prophet.' `Never! Oh, Lord Jesu, save my soul!' was the firm but agonizing response of the Christian. It was with difficulty that Alfonzo could recollect his own danger and restrain the impulse to rush forward to savo him; for he was touched to the heart with admiration by his noble firmness in such an hour of suffering. `Let us pass on, my lord,' said Athir. `You can do nothing. If you speak in his behalf, you will subject yourself to suspicion.' `I will go on, Athir. It would do no good for me to speak. This is but one in a thousand cases that occur each day. To rescue him would be but as a drop taken from the fountain of our sorrows,' he said, riding forward, the crowd making way for him to pass. `The master has powerover his slave, and can do what he will, my lord. The Caliph could not forbid the punishment we have now witnessed. Here we are, my lord, in the street which passes to the morgue. We are at the lower end and will have to pass up towards the morgue. Thou didst say the fourth gate this side?' `Yes, such were my directions.' `Who is it thou wouldst see?' `It is a man who, though a Christian, still lives in Cordova free, though he had to pay large sums for the privilege until he became a Moslem.' `A Moslem?' `Thou shalt see him for thyself, Athir,' answered Alfonzo, who felt that he ought not to betray, even to Athir, that Senor Velez was only outwardly a Mussulman, being at heart a true Christian Spaniard.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XIV. THE MOORISH SPANIARD. The street through which they now were riding, was somewhat obscure in appearance, and quite narrow. It extended from the rear of the city to the grand central square, and passed close by the mosque, the lofty dark walls of which lined it for some distance. It was now nearly dark. The stars shone down between the branches of the trees that grew within the gardens on either side of the way, and the features of the Moors that passed them were undistinguishable. There were but few persons visible, as after eight o'clock no one was suffered to appear in the streets without permission from the commander of the city guard, and then only with a lantern. They now came near the beginning of the mosque walls. Alfonzo looked sharply for the house of the Signor Velez. They at length came opposite a low gate-way, placed in a wall not more than twelve feet high, but which, by counting the doors, answered to the direction given by the hermit, being the fourth from the mosque, which towered in majestic and gloomy grandeur, far above their heads. `This is the place, my lord,' said Athir, with confidence. `Let us wait and ask this Moor who comes along. Brother, dost thou know if this be the dwelling of Velez, the Moslem Spaniard?' `By the beard of Allah, brother, thou art asking one who hath more need to ask than answer,' responded the well-known voice of Ben Osmin. `I have been up to the grand square, to hear the music, and being of late a stranger in Cordova, I have lost my way and know not where to go. I was about to ask thee, but thou art strangers also!' `We are,' answered Alfonzo, who, as well as the astonished Athir, had quickly discovered who the speaker was; but both commanded their surprise. To Alfonzo the meeting was a glad one; but Athir trembled lest he should be recognized, and reclaimed by the Moor, his late master. So he stepped back in a way to place the horse between them.— `What place do you seek, brother?' asked Alfonzo, before whose mental eyes, Genilla now appeared vividly. `The street of Mecca, and the house of Ben Habib, or as some call him Yassef, the turban maker. It is there that I lodge.' `I am sorry I cannot inform thee?' answered Alfonzo. `Tell him to go back, and take the first turn to the right, and the next to the left. It is the street east of this, running the same way,' whispered Athir. Alfonzo gave this information, and received the warm thanks of Ben Osmin, who added, just as Alfonzo was trying to conceive some mode of ascertaining the safety of Genilla— `And I not only thank thee, but I have a fair daughter who would thank thee also, for this service, brother; for she hath cried her eyes out by this time, lest I should have fallen into evil hands.' `Then thou hast a daughter, brother?' `A daughter, whose eyes are brighter than diamonds, and who is as good and virtuous as she is fair. I have been but three days in Cordova, and half the gallants in the suite of the new Caliph, have rode by Ben Habib's door, prancing and caracolling to show their bravery and handsome appearance. But she is not a maiden to be caught with glitter, or good horsemanship.' `Then she hath escaped all the snares set for her beauty,' said Alfonzo, not a little relieved by his last words, and in his heart blessing the faithfulness of Genilla. To hear from her, too, and to know that she was well and in safety, filled his bosom with joy. But he sighed that Xariffa was not also as safe. The news which Ben Osmin had thus unconsciously conveyed to him, relieved his mind from a great weight of anxiety, which had oppressed him, in relation to her; for he knew that she had been in Cordova through all the revolutions, and was now there exposed to the lawless pleasure of Abdelasis, who if he beheld her, had only to command her to be brought to his presence, who had but to speak to make her his slave. `I am glad to know, brother, thou art so happy as to be blessed with such a daughter,' he answered. `Dost thou make a long stay in Cordova; if so, I should like to know thee, and see this beautiful maiden, though I am no wooer like these young knights you speak of.' `I shall be here for two days more. If thou wouldst come and take coffee with me, brother, I will gladly see thee. Thou wilt find me at the sign of the scarlet turban, in the street of Mecca, at the house of Ben Habib. His abode is lowly, but he is an honest man; and a good name is better than gold. Allah be with thee, brother, and in thy old age may men honor thee!' `May Allah keep thee a thousand years, brother, and may thy children rise up and call thee blessed!' With these words, Alfonzo dismounted, while Ben Osmin hurried away in search of the dwelling of Ben Habib.— Afonzo congratulated himself at this meeting; and he would have been perfectly happy if the thoughts of Xariffa did not so forcibly press upon his mind. Of her fate he was wholly ignorant.— That she had been brought into Cordova and was in the seraglio of Abdelasis, he sadly believed. But he had no time now to dwell upon a subject so painful. He resolved to see Senor Velez, and be governed by his advice touching any efforts to rescue her. `Shall I knock at the gate, my lord?' `Yes, but not noisely.' `Who would enter here?' asked a voice from within, a moment after Athir had struck upon the door. `A friend. Open in the name of Allah, brother?' said Athir. `I can admit no one after night, without a command from the Caliph or the Captain of the city,' answered the person in a firm voice, but pleasing to the ear. `We shall not get in, my master!' responded Athir in a tone of disappointment. `Doubtless there are robbers about, and he mistakes us for such!' `Hold the bridle, Athir. I will speak to him,' answered Alfonzo, approaching the gate, which was cast into deep shadow by the projecting Moorish arch over it. `Art thou not the Senor Velez?' he asked, in Spanish. `Yes,' responded the Spaniard, in a tone evidently of surprise at being addressed in his own tongue, by men in Moorish costume; for he could see, through a little window at the side gate, the figures of his visitors. `I am a friend to thee. I am sent by one who gave me this little token, which I place in thy hands. If it satisfies thee, admit me, my horse and servant; for there is a party of cavalry coming down the street, and I would rather be under cover when they came by.' With these words, Alfonzo drew from his bosom the little silver cross which the hermit had given him, and handed it to the Senor Velez through the little opening by the post of the gate. There was a moment's suspense while the Spaniard took the cross to a light to examine it, and the removal of the bars of the gate with a clanking of heavy chains was heard by them, and the door slowly swung open to admit them. `Welcome, Senor, and quickly, thou and thy steed. It is not safe to keep one's gate open long, in such times as these, after dark. Lead the horse through into the court, slave. Thy hand, Senor. Welcome to my home. I know, Moor as thy garb would make thee to be, that thou art a Spaniard, and a friend to the abbot Godfrey. Who thou art, thou wilt, doubtless, by and by, inform me!' With these words, he drew him into the court, and Athir followed, leading the horse, whom he conducted to the stalls on the opposite side of the walled court-yard, which Senor Velez pointed out to him. He then secured the gate, and by a flight of steps led Alfonzo into a handsome room, at the extremity of which was a raised floor, carpeted and surrounded with divans, in Moorish style of furnishing houses. The Spaniard himself was habited as a Moslem, and with his mixed white and black beard, his noble forehead and fine eyes, his lofty figure and air of quiet dignity, he might have been taken for a Sultan. He wore a white muslin turban, clasped by a diamond in front; a long crimson sash bound together at his waist the folds of his white bermish. His vest, which was visible through the opening in his robe, was of yellow, worked with gold. He wore red morocco slippers, turned up in a half-moon at the toes, and gilded with a border of flowers. His appearance, with that of the apartment, was strictly Moorish. For a moment Alfonzo believed that he was in the dwelling of a Mussulman, rather than that of a native Spaniard, who still held to the faith of the cross. The Senor Velez led his guest to the dais, or raised floor, at the extremity of the apartment, and seated him upon a divan, above which was suspended a silver lamp filled with burning olive oil, that shed a soft clear radiance around. `Thou hast seen the Abbot Godfrey, lately,' said the host, clasping together his hands as he spoke, a signal for the appearance of a Nubian slave in a pink turban and flowing white muslin trowers. `Elec, coffee.' The slave bowed profoundly and retired. `I saw the holy father at noon-tide.' `So lately. He then reached the mountains safely. I rejoice at this. Pardon my close scrutiny, Senor, but I would like to know why thou art here, and in this guise? and why this silver cross was given to thee for me? I expected it to have been brought by some one else than such as thou seemest to be? `Who did you expect would bring it, Senor?' `I may not say. Reveal thyself and there shall be confidence between us.' `I am the pupil of father Godfrey This he bade me say to you.' `His pupil! He was a peasant youth,' said the Spaniard with surprise, gazing upon the noble aspect and commanding air of the young man before him. `So am I, Senor. I am Alfonzo.' `Thou the Destroyer?' `The Moors have called me so, Senor.' `Then, welcome: thrice welcome. Forgive my coldness and suspicion, noble Alfonzo. Do I indeed behold thee of whom I have heard so much!' he cried, surveying him with emotion and admiration. `Let me embrace thee! I dared not hope so much when the abbot bade me be ready to see thee beneath my roof ere many days passed! Welcome to my house and to my heart.' Alfonzo was not a little gratified to meet with such a reception in the very heart of the city of his foes. `I feel happy, noble Velez,' he said, on beholding one whom Spain has honored, and who sat at the right hand of two of her princes. But I am sorry that I find thee an exile under the very shadow of the palace of the Spanish Kings, and doomed to wear the turban of the conqueror to purchase life.' `I wear it not to buy my life, Alfonzo, but to watch my foes, the enemies of Spain and of God.' `I know it, noble Senor. The holy hermit hath unfolded to me all this. He hath sent me to thee to learn how Spain stands in the scale with her opponent.' `I am glad to see thee, Alfonzo. I am glad to hold converse with one man who feels for, and loves Spain, and seeks her glory again. The abbot hath told me how thou lovest thy country. He hath old me how thou mournest over her downfall, and art ready to draw the sword of liberty to redeem her.' `He hath told thee truly, Senor. But what can I do? Thou knowest that I am but a peasant.' `Thou art more! Thou hast, by thy courage and example raised and led to vicry to over banditti a handfull of thy mountaineers. A man who can do this, and who will do this, can make that handfull of men a thousand, and that thousand ten thousand.' `Would to God, Senor, thy words were prophetic!' exclaimed Alfonzo. `But I feel my weakness. I am ready to do all than man can do for my bleeding, enslaved country; but there are many nobles, many of the ranks far above me, who would mock my pretensions, and scorn to be led by a herdsman.' `Then let them find a leader among themselves, if they can. They will find no one;—they are all cowards, made so by bondage. Mark me, Alfonzo: they will hail with joy the man who lifts the Standard of the Cross again in the land, and unsheathes his sword to defend it. The Abbot Godfrey and I have discoursed this matter well. We have talked of you and your influence among the hardy mountaineers. He tells me that they all love you, and that you have only to stand up and say that Spain shall be free—your arm will free her. It is an example—a leader that men want.' `Senor, I have given myself to this work; I am conscious of the difflculties; I may fail—I may perish; but I shall do all that I can do for my poor country. I will act as if I had authority: for I see no other man who will stand in my place and lift the standard of liberty. I will do it, and trust in God, who caused David with a sling to overthrow Goliah, and give victory to Israel.' `That is the true spirit, my brave son,' said the Spaniard, as the Nubian re-entered and served coffee to them, in silver cups of exquisite workmanship.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XV. THE YOUTHFUL CHIEF. The coffee which the slave served up was accompanied by dried fruits and other refreshments, to which was added the rich wine of Xeres, nectar delicious enough to tempt the Moslem to break the laws of his Prophet. While Alfonzo was engaged in doing justice to the hospitable repast set before him after his fatigues of the day, Athir entered, and standing silently, waited to be noticed by his master, as if he were indeed Alfonso's slave. The keen glance of the Spaniard rested on him steadfastly for a moment, and then turning quickly to his guest, he said with surprise, not untinged with something like rising suspicion,— `Thy servant is a Moor! There is no deception in that eye and brow. He is a Moor—how is this?' `He is a Moor, Senor,' answered Alfonzo; `but he can be trusted. He is faithful to me, and will be to thee.' `I never yet knew one I could trust,' answered Velez. `How! Is he thy slave? I have never yet known a Moor the slave of a Christian.' `I will tell thee about it, Senor,' answered Alfonzo; and he then proceeded to relate to him the facts touching his history, which have already been repeated to the reader. When he had done, the Spanish noble called to Athir, and gave him his hand. `Young man, I honor thy fidelity! I will also trust thee, if Alfonzo hath done so. Thou mayest be of service to us. Elec,' he added, after clapping his hands and bringing in the Nubian slave, `see that thou givest refreshment to this youth, and that he has a mat spread down in the room of the fountain, where thou wilt also prepare a couch for his master.— See, too, that his horse wants nothing.' The Nubian clasped his hands above his head, and bowed to the ground in token of obedience, and departed, followed by Athir. `Now, my brave friend,' said the Spanish noble, turning to his guest, `let us talk over the wrongs of Spain, and let us see what can be done to redress them. I converse with thee with full confidence. I know thy courage and influence well with the mountaineers; and when news reached me three years ago that a young mountaineer had armed and led on his neighbours, and driven the banditti from the Sierras, I blessed God that there was yet one stout arm and brave heart left in Spain, though it were but a mountain youth's. And when a few month's later the rumor came that this same youth had stormed a castle, and driven El Zegris forth a fugitive, I again blessed God, and began to believe that there were yet good men left in Spain, who feared not the Moor. When more recently came the intelligence that El Zegris had again been attacked and overthrown by thee, his person made captive, and his right hand struck off by thy scymetar, I said in my heart— `If Spain shall ever call for a champion, that youth, whose prowess is in all men's mouths, is the man to lead her to victory. But then I knew no more than this, that thou werest a humble herdsman. Since, the holy Abbot Godfrey, hath given me the outline of thy history, and his opinion did but confirm my own, that thou shouldst one day be the mover of a revolt agaiust our masters. He said that you were a lover of your country, and mourned her wrongs, but that you were doubtful of your influence, and too modest to know its wide extent. He felt sure, however, that you would one day rouse up, and stand in your native power, and call on your countrymen to arm for God and Spain. To this end, he said, he had been watching over your mind and heart, and so training thee to be one day the saviour of thy country.' `What I am, I owe to my excellent friend,' answered Alfonzo, who had sat quietly under the high language of eulogium, that flowed from the lips of Senor Velez. `What he has made me, that my country shall have the benefit of.— But, Senor, I never looked to so wide a feld of action as opens so unexpectedly before me, and which I seem to be irresistibly thrust upon. I looked only to be the leader of a small band of my fellow herdsmen, to hold the Sierras free from step of the Moslem, whether soldier or bandit. Beyond this, I dare not aspire, though my heart has secretly burned at the thought, that I should like to be the saviour of my country. I have wished that my voice might rouse all the men in Spain, as it hath stirred the breasts of my fellow peasants when I have called upon them to rally around me, to drive the robber from his fastnesses, or attack a horde of wolves in their lair.' `Do not shrink. Heaven will gird thee with strength. We want a man whom Spain has heard of, and the Moors too!” `I shall not shrink. I have a motive that urges me onward side by side with the desire I have to see Spain free. It is revenge for my sister's wrongs. Within the last twelve hours, Senor Velez, my only sister, loved and lovely beyond compare, has been stolen by the troops of Abdelasis from her pure home, and carried away to his harem.' `Is this so? Alas, I pity thee. Thou hast reason to take arms, young man.— But this is no new thing that it should be made a reason.' `No—but to me it is. I should have moved ere this to avenge others. But I lingered ignobly, timid and hesitatingly, till the blow came home to me. Then I became earnest. Then, and only till then, I am ashamed to acknowledge, did I resolve that I would not rest till I had roused a spirit of resistance in the length and breadth of the land!' `This decision must have filled the holy Abbot's heart with joy; for the weal of Christian Spain is the theme of his daily prayer. For this he only lived.' `His joy I cannot describe! So often had he talked to me of the glory that should fall upon him who should, whether prince or peasant, lead Spain against the Moslem once more; so often had he implored me to take a bold stand, humble as I was, for God and liberty; so often had he told me that I owed to Spain what influence I procured over my friends about me; that when I told him I had at length got awake and had resolved to kindle the flames of revolt, and I could almost have believed that he had been instrumental in the abduction of my sister, that my heart might thereby be roused; for it seems it wanted this to move me, Senor,' he added, bitterly smiling. `I can imagine his joy. My own heart is young again when I look upon thy noble form and think that Christian Spain, in Alfonzo the Destroyer has once more a Champion!' `But how will Spain receive me, Senor?' `With open arms!' `I do not doubt but that among the Sierras I shall be able to assemble at least two thousand brave men. Not that I am known to one third of this number, but those I do know are acquainted with others, and will influence them. This day I was one of an assembly of fifty in the cork forest of Debal; fifty brave men, including my father, Gaspar. Hast thou heard of him?' `I knew him, when he was one of the bravest nobles in Spain. He has had a hard fate. From father Godfrey I have from time to time heard of him and of his great prowess. As Gaspar, the Wolf-Slayer, his name is celebrated even among the Moors.' `When didst thou see the Abbot last?' `He left here this morning, disguised as a Hadji, and when he parted from me he promised me that ere many days he should send to me the Deliverer of Spain. `And,' he added, `whomsoever comes to thee bringing this cross, receive him as a friend. It may possibly be my Alfonzo, if not some other who will give the tidings of things in the Sierras!' These were the Abbot's words to me; and little did I expect to embrace thee so soon!' `Nor wouldst thou have seen me to-night, but for the outrage put upon me in taking my beloved sister away by force. I could almost be persuaded to believe that father Godfrey had an agency in sending the troop to capture her; for he knew I needed this to move me to my duty!' `Art thou in earnest in this suspicon?' `God forbid. I did but speak of the coincidence between the fact and the result. He loves me, and is too good for this, even though he thought he could free Spain thereby.' `If ever father loved a son, the Abbot loves thee. I know not what there is that hath, for years, as I know, bound him to thee, beyond thy good qualities and noble countenance, which no man would look upon without feeling an interest in thee. But for what didst thou get these fifty brave mountaineers together in the forest?' `They assembled at the cry that the Moors had poured upon our hamlet and borne away the Star of the Sierras, as they loved to call Xariffa. But pursuit was in vain. I then swore solemnly before my maker that I would never rest till I had rescued her, or driven the Spoiler out of Spain, if men would arm and follow me!' `Brave words. St. Diego be thanked! This sounds like steel ringing on steel. What said they?' `They received my words with acclamations. It inspired me. I saw in their readiness the spirit of all others. The Abbot came suddenly upon us, and when he knew what had been determined on, tears of joy came into his eyes. He would have embraced my knees. He clasped me to his heart, saying, `For this hour have I watched over thee—for this hour have I lived!' `Thou must have felt rewarded already at witnessing the happiness he felt.' `I was, Senor. But you will be surprised to know that he made me kneel, and did there in a most solemn manner consecrate me by prayer and anointing with holy oil, to the service of my country. I would have resisted, but he held me down; and I submitted, though I trembled, at the awful ceremony;—for I did not feel equal to what men seemed to call upon me to perform.' `I tell thee, son, God will give thee strength. Thou art raised up his servant and Captain; of this be assured, and go forward with courage to thy duty. But this is singular indeed!—kings only are anointed; and what is more extraordinary, the Abbot himself anointed Amalaric, our last Christian Gothic king, whom Taric the conqueror slew, with the royal Princes of his house.' `Were but one of those young Princes alive now, Senor, and proclaiming himself such, should raise the standard of the cross, all Spain would rise as one man to rally around him. But for me, I have no more than the wrongs of Spain, the oppression of the Moor, to appeal to.' `And what more do you ask? all men in Spain will respond to the appeal.' `I will point heavenward to God, and tell them that He is their Prince and King—that I am but a servant in his hand!' `Thou art too modest—but I like it in thee. It shows me that thou art the person to be trusted. Fifty men, saidst thou? What became of them?' `I sent them two by two up the valleys, and over the Sierras, to penetrate every where a Christian dwelt and walked, and call on them to up and arm for their country, and on the eve of St. James be found at the Rock of St. Paul.' `This is indeed news—great news! And did you see them depart?' `Filled with zeal. By this time two thousand men have been told the tale, that on the eve of St. James the standard of the cross will be raised on the sacred Rock over against Cordova.' `Heaven prosper the cause! Thou hast began well; the Sierras will soon be alive! But what can be done here? for I know thou art in Cordova to ask that very question,' `I have come to see if there are any left here who remember Spain under its Christian King, and who in their bondage sigh again for those days to return. I have left Gaspar to act as my lieutenant till I return. The news of the revolt will reach only Christian ears till the hour to strike arrives.' `If fifty thousand Christians were entrusted with the secret, not one Moor could get possession of it. Now we will see what can be done here. In the valleys and mountains there are one hundred thousand Spaniards. If this news flies fast, and secretly as fast, it will be easy to bring to your standard twenty thousand men by the eve of St. Diego.' `Not my standard, Senor, but Christ's,' answered Alfonzo, with his characteristic modesty. `I see thou art well-fitted for the place that Heaven hath put thee in,' said the Spaniard impressively. `Thou wilt become a popular leader. I will give thee twenty thousand men from the valleys and the hills, noble chief: but in Cordova I know not how many—but we will soon see.'</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XVI. THE TWO CONSPIRATORS. The Spaniard now produced a roll of parchment, and unfolding it, laid it upon the divan between them, and said, as he ran his finger over the columns of names and trades and conditions: `Here is a register which I have kept, so far as I could make it accurate of the number of Spanish Christians in Cordova. The aggregate at which I see your eye glances, makes them sixty-six thousand, old and young, male and female.' `It is a larger number than I had supposed,' answered Alfonzo. `Yes, our people seem to live wonderfully long under this servitude. Here you see are about sixteen thousand ablebodied men, capable of bearing arms, in these sixty-six thousand; the balance being old, or women and children. Of these sixteen thousand, many of them are of the best blood of Spain—and now they are hewers of wood and drawers of water to the Moor. There is not an Infidel in Cordova, however low his degree or mean his trade, who has not one or more of these, our Christian brethren, as slaves. You of the mountains have fared better and kept your freedom!' `But it will not be much longer, I hear, if we are supine. I allude, Senor, to the decree of Abdelasis!' `It is a base and cruel one. It is worthy of himself. When I read it yesterday, I then said, `In this decree, Caliph, unless Spain be utterly lost, you have signed the downfall of Moslem power in the land!' `I believe so,' answered Alfonzo, with warmth. `There is not fifty men in Spain base enough to come into Cordova and thus register their names, knowing that they are to be afterwards compelled to become Moslem's.' `I trust there are not!' `It was this decree which I heard of, even before I knew of my sister's loss, which kindled the flames of liberty in my bosom. The outrage done me by stealing her away was setting the last torch. I have hopes that the noise of the decree will do more for the cause—do more to bring men to their duty than any influence I can exert. Still a rallying point is needed; and till Heaven gives my country a better leader, I am willing to stand up first and strike for Spain and the Cross!' `The decree of Abdelasis will go before your fifty messengers, and prepare the way for them. Gladly they will listen to tidings that will point them to a chieftain who dares defy Abdelasis, and abide the issue, trusting to God and his cause!' `Your words give me more confidence in myself, noble Velez. How many of these sixteen thousand men will listen to these tidings here in Cordova? Can access be got to their ears? Can they be communicated with, without excting before the time the suspicions of their masters?' `Yes. I have influence with one hundred men here, of our nation; slaves they are, indeed, but they are well treated and have much leisure; some of them even acting as Secretaries to officers of the State, at least to such as were officers under the Emirs. These men love Spain as I do. They mourn over her degradation and the stain upon the true cross, cast by the shadow of the Crescent. They look, as I have looked, for a Deliverer to arise in the land. Your name they have heard, and repeated it to me. These men know each one or more others whom they talk with upon the wrongs of their land; and these associate with others. `In a word, the whole sixteen thousand are linked together in degrees, like those I have mentioned. An idea communicated to one, reaches every individual, however lowly he may lie in his bonds. One word of hope spoken this night by me to four or five friends, ere morning, would have stirred and warmed a thousand hearts; and in twenty-four hours, not a Christian slave in Cardova would be ignorant of it.' `This is all that could be desired for our cause. I did not know before that the slaves of our people here in Cordova, thus kept alive a love of Spain.— They have, most of them, seemed sullenly indifferent, or else cowardly contented in their servitude!' `And why should you look for outward signs of freedom among men, who live in bonds—over whose heads hangs the scymetar of the Caliph, or the thonged lash of his master. Who are watched; who are without arms; who have no King nor leader to look up to, to keep alive hope—who are treated as the dogs of the kennel!' `What a picture of degradation. Poor Spain! alas, for my degraded countrymen!' `It is your sacred duty, Alfonzo, to strike a blow in their behalf! They will hear your name with joy! Alfonzo, our deliverer, will flow like honey from their lips, and they will feel their hearts once more throb with hope. The grey-headed man will lift up his bowed form, and recall again the glories of the past, and hope to behold them once more restored. The youthful will look forward to see, what they have not yet seen, Spain once more a Christian kingdom. Mothers and maidens will bless thee, and thou wilt have that calm, deep joy in thy bosom, which will flow from the happiness, of which you have been the instrument.' `But much is to be done, Senor.— There are in Cordova—' `Thirty thousand Moorish citizens and eighteen thousand Moorish soldiers, exclusive of the Zenetan cavalry, one thousand strong, and which now compose the body-guard of the new Caliph, as they have done of the Emir's before him. They are mercenaries, and are paid for their services, and serve him who pays them best.' `There may be then, full twenty five thuusand men to encounter, soldiers and citizens,' said Alfonzo. `To take Cordova will require thirty thousand.' `This number, mark my words, will be raised easily; and if the revolt goes on secretly, so that Abdelasis knows not of the coming storm till it bursts upon him, less than this number will do. But if he should hear of it, he will so prepare for it, that we may need fifty thousand men to take the city, and maintain the ports in the valley.' `The undertaking is a great one, Senor, but I trust we shall have the aid of Heaven, and I feel assured, that if other Christian nations see us make an effort to expel the Moor, we shall have the aid of their swords.' `I foresee this, Alfonzo. Now I think we understand each other, and know our duties in the task before us. Mine is to call on the influential Christians in the city, and make known to them our contemplated movement. I will confide the secret to a few confidential men, who will spread it from lip to ear, till all who hate the Moors in Cordova, shall know that a Deliverer is raised up in Cordova, and they will be ready to act with us as one man!' `When will you see these friends?' asked Alfonzo, rising. `At once. I will go forth at once with Elic to bear a lantern before me, and visit a few of the principal persons I have in my mind. I shall find them easily, and can see them without suspicion, as among the Moors I am taken for a Moor; and I have business with their masters almost daily in the way of my traffic, for I am a dealer in silks, as you shall see in the marning, when I shall show you my goods, Will you remain here, my chief?' `Call me Alfonzo, Senor.' `Nay, thou art our chief, and must submit to be addressed as such. I feel that God has given the deliverance of Spain, and the restoration of the cross to thee to perform. To thy power and guidance I bow, and so will all men who hear thy name. It is now eight o'clock. I shall return by ten, and you can repose here on this divan, for you must needs be weary.' Thus speaking, Senor Velez threw on a long brown cloak which he wore abroad, and girding it at the waist by a sash, he covered his head with a scarlet turban of many voluminous folds, and took a staff in his hand. `Elec,' he said to the Nubian, who entered at his call, take your lantern and go forth with me.' The slave, after a moment's absence, returned with a large, richly painted lantern, and preceding his master undid the gate, and waited for him to pass. `I shall return in two hours, I trust, able to say to thee, Alfonzo, that the ball has been set in motion, which shall not cease to roll till it has thrown down Mosque and minaret. You will not venture forth till I return, for it would peril your life unnecessarily.' `I will await you here, Senor, though I feel little disposed to repose,' answered the young chief. `Say to these Christian bondmen that they must make no movement, but only wait and stand prepared to strike when they hear the war cry of Spain breaking on their ears on the eve of San Diego.' The rich Spanish merchant then folded his cloak about him, and departed up the street, giving Alfonzo particular directions to secure the gate and to admit no one. Alfonzo followed, with his eye, the dark forms, with their flickering lantern, till they disappeared up the street, and then turned to secure the gate. Athir was at his shoulder. `My lord,' said the youth, `I will bar the gate. But I expected you would go forth to see what hath become of Xariffa.' `That, Athir, is a mission I shall give to thee,' he said, smiling. `To me?' cried the youth with sparkling eyes. `Yes, to you, Athir. I want you to go and ascertain where she is. You will proceed at once to the palace of Abdelasis, and I will leave to your address and courage to get the intelligence I desire. It will be easier for you, being a Moor, than for me, and besides, I am known to Abdelasis, and I should not wish to be discovered.' `I will go, my lord. I know I can hear something from her if she is at the palace. I would disguise myself as a page and go boldly into the palace if I had the dress.' `If you had gold could you purchase such a costume? Are not the bazaars closed?' `Not till nine o'clock, my lord.' `Then here are five pieces which the holy father put into my hand, saying I should want money in Cordova, and I find he spoke truly.' `I can get all I want for two of the gold pieces, my lord. I know well where the bazaar is, in which I used to purchase my suits when I was a page. I will go there; and, habited as a page of the palace, I will discover if Xariffa is in the power of Abdelasis; and I will return ere breakfast to-morrow, perhaps earlier, and let you know what I hear.' `You can inquire of those about, what Christian maiden it was that a party of Zenetan horse captured to-day, and if she were sold. This question will open a way to my poor sister's discovery.' `Trust to me, my lord! I will proceed to my task with courage and love for thee!' answered the youth. Alfonzo grasped him by the hand, warmly, and then set him forth. `Thou must have a lantern?' `No. I will glide along by the shad ows. Thou shalt soon hear of thy sister's fate, my lord!' Thus speaking, he glided away up the street in the direction taken by Signor Velez and his Nubian slave; and was soon lost in the darkness that enveloped the street. `Now,' said Alfonzo as he lingered at the open gate, `now have I done all that is in my power to do in behalf of my sister. Once let me know her fate and I shall know how to act in her behalf. That she is in the power of Abdelases, I have now no doubt: for the party was composed of the Zeretan horse, who, says Signor Velez, are taken into the Caliph's service. I begin to fear he may have seen my sister, and been inspired with passion for her, and so has done this deed! But I shall learn when the faithful Athir returns!'</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XVII. THE SERENADER. Alfonzo had not been long alone after the departure of Athir when he began to experience restless desire to see Genilla, and ascertain if she were in safety. `Duty and religion,' he said within himself, `would teach me to forget her now that I have given myself to the overthrow of her people's power and the upraising of the cross where the crescent now stands! But my heart is more powerful with its arguments than my head. I must see! I cannot cease loving her. I hope yet to make her a christian!' He was pacing up and down the paved court within the house of Signor Velez as he thus mused. It was overhung with trees on two sides that grew in a garden, to which a gate in the wall led. The moon was just rising and silvering the tops of the palms and shedding its lustre upon the minarets. The dwee-loo or Andalusian nightingale was singing in the branches of an orange tree above his head, and the air was laden with fragrance. He examined the little gate which was set in the wall and found that by drawing a bolt on the innerside it came open. He passed through it and found himself in a spacious garden of shady walks, fountains and terraces. It was a scene of wonderful beauty to be thus hidden in the heart of the city. In the centre of the garden, were two lofty palms that waved their tall capitals in the soft winds and cast an ever moving shade upon the sward at his feet. He was charmed with the loveliness and quiet of the place. He rambled on, and passing a marble fountain, ascended a flight of steps, which led him to a higher terrace of the garden. He saw in the distance the walls of a villa, on the remote extremity of the garden overlooking it. He moved slowly in the direction of it, and as he came in sight of a lattice he thought he heard voices. He drew his scymetar, and threw back the folds of his bernish, so as to free his right arm, and taking off his turban, he cautiously went forward. But instead of an enemy or foes seeking to attack him, he saw, as he passed round the trunk of a large cypress, with his sword in his grasp, ready to defend himself should he come suddenly upon foes,—leaning in an easy attitude against a palm-tree, a man playing upon a guitar, and singing as he played with a fine rich voice. He could not be deceived!—the voice was that of Abdelasis; and as the moonlight fell full upon his figure, revealing his features, he clearly recognised the Caliph. He stood transfixed at the discovery; his first impulse was to rush forward and attack him upon the spot, and if possible take him prisoner. But he reflected that aid might be nigh—that he knew not where he was, having wandered through the gardens some distance from the merchant's house, and that his retreat might be cut off. Besides, Abdelasis—though he deserved punishment for his treachery to him—might be innocent of the abduction or of the fate of Xariffa. He was not a little surprised to meet the Caliph in these gardens, and especially thus sentimentally playing the lover. He bent his eyes keenly to see if he could discern any one at the lattice; but all was quiet there, and no sign even of a fair hand upon the casement. He remained for a few moments, concealed by the trunk of the cypress from the view of Abdelasis, whose face was upturned to the lattice. He could not catch but here and there a word of what he sang, but it was enough to show him that it was a song of love. At length he ceased, and looked up to the lattice intently, and then waved his guitar towards it, saying— `Cruel fair one! He who woos thee might command thee. It is I, not thou, who am bound a prisoner;—my heart is in chains, and I sigh in bondage! Wilt thou not appear, lady?' There was no reply; the lattice betrayed no presence; and the Prince slowly moved away, stealthily followed by Alfonzo. The latter pressed rapidly forward, but suddenly drew back on seeing four Moorish soldiers standing in the path waiting for the Caliph, who joined them and disappeared in a dark alcove of foliage that overhung the wall. Alfonzo went onward, and coming to the place, found that a gate had let them forth; but whether into a street or another garden adjoining he could not tell, as the wall was so high. `This is a wilderness of gardens,' said he, as he looked about him. `Can it be possible I am in the royal gardens of the palace? How singular that I should have beheld Abdelasis, and in such an occupation! He may well say, he who wooes may command. And what maiden is it who dares dispute his power and scorn his love? Who can it be who has so won his heart that he dare not command, but is compelled to sue; and even puts up with silence and indifference? Whoever she is who rules the proud Prince thus by love, rules Spain! I will return and watch this lattice well; it may be that I may see her. Were it not that he sued so humbly for her favor, I should believe that it was Xariffa. I will at least endeavor to ascertain who it is. It is well that I did not attack the Caliph as my first impulse prompted me to do. I should have been overpowered or slain; and I have given my life to Spain not to be cast away in a broil even with Abdelasis for my antagonist. If I had slain him now Spain would have been no less in bondage. Others would have risen, and anarchy and discord would have filled Cordova. It is better for our conspiracy that the Moslem power be consolidate and united under him that we may know where to strike, and know that when we strike we strike off the head. Let Abdelasis live till we are ready to meet and overthrow him with all who belong to him.' He now came in front of the lattice and looked up with caution. There was no one visible. He was in shadow and yet commanded a full and near view of the casement. He saw that it had been opened since the Caliph left, for it was now ajar, and when he was before it, it was closely shut. This fact as well as the earnest manner of the Prince in his moonlight serenade led him to feel confident that some one was there. He resolved to ascertain whether it were Xariffa or not by singing a few notes of a Spanish ballad that she well knew and which they had often sung together. He began at first in a low tone and then raising his voice till it fully reached the casement he sang one verse of the ballad, his eye, from his covert, full upon the lattice. It was suddenly thrown open—a white arm glowed in the moonlight and Xariffa looked eagerly forth. The heart of Alfonzo bounded with joy. He lifted up his heart in gratitude to God that he had found his lost sister. But he did not at once show himself. He was apprehensive: he might have attracted attention by his singing from some other ears than hers. He therefore remained silent and immoveable watching her, his heart throbbing with joy. She looked eagerly out and bending far forward listened. She closely surveyed the ground beneath the lofty casement, and seemed loth to give up the search. He could see that her face was pale and anxious. He knew that she was a prisoner; but why Abdelasis should thus humbly woo amazed him. But he had not been cognizant of their former interview in the cabin. He was ignorant of the sudden passion which his guest had entertained for his sister, and how completely enthralled by her charms was his haughty spirit. Finding all was still in the garden, Alfonzo thought he could safely make himself known, and advancing from the shadow of the wall he suddenly appeared before her, forgetting his Moorish costume, supposing she would instantly recognise him as he had done her.— But when seeing him she stepped back from the casement with a slight exclamation. He then removed his turban and called to her: `Xariffa! Sister! It is I!' Instantly the maiden reappeared at the window, and uttered an exclamation of delight as she gazed down upon the noble brow of her brother on which the moonlight broadly lay. `Oh, Alfonzo, God bless you for seeking me out! But fly at once! You cannot save me. You will perish! You know not in whose power I am.' `I know well, Xariffa. I saw the Caliph leave this place. You are in his power. I will save you. `You can do nothing. This window is too lofty for me to descend to you, and if you should reach the casement you would only rush upon death. This palace is closely guarded. I am a prisoner! and I would not have you share my fate! Fly! Think not of me but fly!' `I am secure in my disguise, Xariffa. I have found you and I will not go away and have you in the hands of Abdelasis. Was it not by his order you were taken captive?' `Yes. I was brought to the city and to this tower, where he came to see me; but I rejected his suit with scorn?' `And yet he loves thee! Did he see thee, Xariffa?' asked Alfonzo earnestly, coming still nearer to the window, `did he see you at the hamlet?' `Alas! he did. He came to my room unexpectedly. He talked long with me. He offered me his heart, but I refused to listen to him. He left me, but in anger. I should have told this to you, and you would have guarded me more securely. I owe my present situation to my silence.' `It cannot now be helped, sister! I know that it was not your fault. But the Prince loves you! You have powerover him that no one in Spain possesses. He will be goaded to madness by your indifference, and destroy you, a sacrifice to his pride and passion. I will aid you to escape. Can you throw me a cord?' `There is none. I cannot escape, save by the gates, and these are guarded by armed men. I do not fear the Prince. If he persists, I have a dagger, and will die, ere I become his slave!' `Nay, Xariffa, I am glad to see thee show thyself so resolute. But this must not be. Thou must be rescued. Who else hast thou in the palace with thee?' `There are slaves to do my bidding. The apartments are sumptuous. I am surrounded with every luxury. Abdelasis has twice been here and knelt at my feet. He said he disdained to make me a slave by his power, he sued for the free gift of my heart. To-night he has sought to win me with songs of love. He is very kind!' `Couldst thou love him, Xariffa?' asked Alfonzo, struck with her last words, and beginning to suspect that her heart might be secretly interested and moved by his flattering homage and profound attentions. `Love a moslem?' she repeated with amazement. `Suppose he were a christian, sister?' `Then I could, indeed love him! He is very noble and tender in his speech, and has every grace to win a maiden's love! But I do not forget that he is an unbeliever!' `And thou wilt not forget even this, long, my sister, I see,' answered Alfonzo, bitterly, who, with grief perceived that she was inclined with all her resistance Vol. 2, Sig. 5. to regard the prince with favor rather than with anger and detestation. But he had not seen Abdelases in her presence after she was brought into the city, for it was by his order that the captain of the Zenetan horsemen took her captive. Instead of bringing her to his Seraglio he had ordered the captain to take her to his former palace, that in which Alfonzo now discovered her. Here she was delivered to the charge of female slaves, and after a bath was robed by them in magnificent apparel and conducted to the sumptuous apartments in the casement of which she was now conversing with Alfonzo.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XVIII. THE CALIPH AND HIS CAPTIVE. After the fair captive had recovered a little from her surprise on finding herself thus treated, rather as if she were a princess than a mountain maiden, and her alarm at finding herself in the power of Abdelases (for the captain had told her it was by his order he had acted) had subsided, she began to contemplate her condition. It was no new thing to her to know that the Moorish chief stole fair christian girls from their homes to make them slaves in Cordova. She knew that such was to be her condition. She was not so miserable as she would have been had her heart been interested in any youth of her native Scerias; but she was heart-free. She had no one to think of, therefore, but herself and her brother and Gaspar, her father. For these she shed tears. The Moorish captain had told her that she was not to be sold like other maidens in the lagoon, but that the prince would himself honor her by making her his slave. She paced up and down the gorgeous apartments, now melted to tears, now burning with anger, now tortured with fear. She had heard that Abdelases was cruel, and she knew that she must prepare to die; for she resolved to treat him with scorn and defiance, and thus by her coldness so enrage him as to induce him to command her execution. She knew that he would visit her. The principal slave of the palace had told her the prince would visit her. She would have torn off the jewels and rich robes and trampled upon them, but she caught sight of herself in a mirror, and let them remain. Suddenly a door opened, and a young man entered with a princely air. She uttered an exclamation of mingled surprise and pleasure. She recognised the guest at the hamlet, of whom she had thought with more kindness and leniency since his departure, than she had felt while he was present. Indeed he had been very much in her thoughts, considering that he was an Infidel. Upon now recognising him, she was moved with surprise, pleasure, and not a little with fear. He approached. She shrunk back, and as he advanced, she retreated. The casement arrested her receding steps. She still regarded him as he ap proached with curiosity and alarm, yet the former emotion seemed strongest. `Fair Xariffa,' he said, `why do you fly me?' `Why am I here? Tell Abdelasis if he sent thee, that I am his prisoner, but I will never be his slave. Did he fear to behold one whom he had wronged, that he sent thee? Was it by thy report that he heard of me? If so, let what little kindness in my heart there remains for thee, turn to hatred and scorn.' `Maiden,' said the youthful Caliph, approaching her with a smile, yet with an air of deference, `in me you behold Abdelasis. It was Abdelasis who was your guest.' At hearing these words, she stood gazing upon him with amazement, and not without a beam of gratification lighting up the cloud which had been gathering upon her brow. She saw that the worst was now made known, that the Abdelasis she had trembled to think upon, was before her, and in the person of the handsome stranger who had declared at her feet his deep passion for her.— She knew not which most to fear, the young Moor as a supposed Saracen cavalier, or Abdelasis, the powerful. `You tremble, maiden. You need not fear me,' he said, kindly. `By Allah, I swear to thee that thou art as free as air, and that I will not harm thee!' `Then if I am free, send me back to my father's roof, to the protection of my brother!' she said, with spirit. `Do not scorn my love, Christian maiden,' said the prince, kneeling at her feet. `I am your captive—not you mine.— This heart is yours, sacredly and faithfully yours,' he added, placing his hand with graceful earnestness upon his heart, and looking up into her face with eyes that beamed with love and adoration.— She would have fled between fear of him and fear of herself, for she felt that her bosom was relenting. But the casement towards which she had retreated, was too high, and she could not escape from listening to the ardent eloquent out-pouring of his passion. It was impossible that she should listen without being moved. She felt that if he were a Christian, she should hear him with pleasure, and requite with gratitude love so profound and sincere as his seemed to be. `Xariffa, thou art ice,' he at length said, as she remained immoveable. `I know not what to say. I am a Christian, thou a Moor. I am a Spanish woman, thou art a Saracen, and my country's foe and oppressor. I cannot listen to thee. I cannot love thee. Do not talk to me of love, noble Prince. If I am free as thou hast said, send me at once freely away. Thou knowest, Prince, a Christian maiden may not give her love to a Moslem!' `I would almost become a Christian for thy sake, sweet Xariffa.' `You mock me. I know that thou and thine are so wedded to thy faith that you never change.' `I have known Christians to change, why wilt not thou?' `Thou hast known only base renegades to become Mussulmen.' `Why, there is the nobleman, Senor Velez, in this city, who is a follower of the true Prophet, and worships in the Mosques.' `I am ashamed for him, and for Spain that has such nobles, Prince,' she answered with spirit. `I will, weak woman as I am, try to atone for his treachery to his country and to his Redeemer, by being steadfast.' `Then you will not pity my great love for thee.' `No, Caliph, I can never consent to give my heart to one who hates the cross and Him crucified thereon. So, if I am at liberty, as thou hast first said, suffer me to be taken whence I was rudely taken.' `Nay, I cannot let thee go. I will now bid thee good bye, sweet Xariffa, for a time, trusting thou wilt think better of me when you reflect upon my love. So I offer to share with thee my crown and power. Thou shalt reign with Abdelasis. Our union shall be the band to unite Spain and Islam. We will make one nation in the land.' `Christ may not dwell with Belial. There can be no mingling of oil and wine. Either the land must be Moslem or Christian; and what would you have me? Think not, noble Prince, I could for thy sake give up my faith; and I know thou wilt not depart from thine, false though it be.' `By the beard of Mehemet, maiden, thou hast spirit enough for a princess. Thy commanding eye and firmness of bearing are imperial. Thou wouldst grace a throne, were it that of Suliman. Have I thy answer?' `Thou hast.' `Dost thou not fear me?' `Yes, but I fear God more.' `Dost thou not know that I can make thee my slave, and that I am condescending to sue to thee thus?' `I know that I am in thy power, but I do not believe thou wouldst degrade it and thyself, by using it as thou hast intimated.' `You speak truly, Xariffa. I love thee, too well, to make thee my slave. I again repeat thou art free to—' `To go?' `No—to love me or hate me.' `How can I love my gaoler?' `I am in hopes to tame thee by keeping thee in this pretty cage. I am in hopes that my kindness and my efforts to render thee happy will melt thy heart. Do not reply; I cannot bear to hear thee say anything that will destroy my hopes. Fare thee well, Xariffa. I will go away but I shall leave behind me all that can make thee truly happy. It is true, I am seated upon the throne of the Emirs, but I feel far from being happy, so long as I am rejected from the throne of thy heart. Think of me, Xariffa. Think of my love, my devotion, my happiness which thou hast in thy keeping. Be pitiful, and forget that I am not a Christian like thyself.' `I can never—' `Not a word, sweet maiden—not another word. Fare well; and perhaps to-morrow I will come and see thee again. In the meantime, think upon me as kindly as thou canst.' With these words, the Prince, with real sadness and disappointment, took a respectful leave of his beautiful captive, and she was once more left alone. She paced the room in troubled thought. she felt that he had a power over her heart, that she dared not contemplate calmly. She felt that his love, so sincere and so respectful, demanded from her a better return than she had met it with. She felt deeply his delicacy and forbearance, when she knew that he might command. She knew that only sincere and sacred love could have dictated such reverence and courtesy. His love pleaded to her heart most strongly in his behalf;—but duty, her duty as a Spanish woman and a Christian, pleaded with greater energy against him. `Oh, that he were a Christian!' she sighed; `then indeed I might listen to him without guilt. But now, I must turn a deaf ear to his eloquent words, and close my eyes to the fire of his eye,— Let me not forget that he is my country's foe—let me not forget he is the enemy of the Cross! Oh, that I were free in my native mountains.' Thus tortured and in suspense between the Prince's love and her sense of duty, she continued to walk her gorgeous apartments, till at length, wearied with the conflict, she sank upon her knees, and in tears and prayers sought relief and guidance. The next that she heard of her lover was his voice beneath her casement the evening of the same day, singing to her a song full of the most earnest passion; for Abdelasis was truly and irresistibly captivated by the fair Christian girl; and although she was in his power, his love invested her with a sacredness in his eyes that was her secure safeguard. Alfonzo, be it remembered, was ignorant of these events, and of the bias in Xariffa's mind towards her princely captor, or he would not have marvelled as he did to notice that absence of fear and disposition to speak favorably of Abdelasis, which she manifested; for he saw that she did not seem to be so overwhelmed with terror as he supposed she would have been, in the power of such a man. `Xariffa,' he said, lifting his eyes once more earnestly to the casement, `I see that unless I secure your escape at once, you will become a willing captive of the Caliph. I know not by what spells he hath charmed your heart, or by what weakness you have been betrayed to listen to him; but I see that thou art as willing to be a captive as to be free.' `Brother, you do me wrong!' she answered with spirit. `I would escape if it were possible without periling your life; but you may see that I connot descend from this casement, and even should you be able to reach it, you could not conduct me in safety from the palace—it is strictly guarded.' `Lady, the Prince comes!' said a beautiful slave, who came that instant to the casement and looked down. `Fly, Alfonzo,' cried Xariffa; `fear not for me! I will be true to myself and to my faith. Fly! if you are taken here you are lost!' she then waved her hand and disappeared. Alfonzo had had time to see that the maiden who came to notify her of the Prince's presence was exceedingly beautiful, slight of figure, and spoke as if she was the friend rather than the spy of his sister. He felt it his duty to obey and escape from the gardens, and sought the distant gate by which he had entered, greatly troubled in his mind as to Xariffa's fate; for he began to tremble for her faith under the dangerous influence of the insinuating Caliph.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XIX. THE TURBAN-MAKER AND HIS GUEST. Alfonzo, upon reaching the court of the Senor Velez, found all quiet as he had left it half an hour before. He, however, had discovered his sister in the power of Abdelasis, yet respected by him, and in danger of forgetting her duty as a Christian woman through the power of his love. But it was out of his power to save her; and to attempt it, might result in his own captivity; and he felt that he was not his own, but belonged to those who had chosen him to be their leader in the coming revolution. He approached the street-gate, and unbarring it, looked out to see if he could discover any signs of the return of the Spanish noble from his friends. But the street was silent. The moonlight lay broadly upon one side of it, lighting up the Morisco edifices with a brilliancy and beauty that the noon-day sun never could lend to them. Here and there the black shadow of a tree lay across the field of moonlight. From a distance came to his ear low sounds of music, and remotely he heard the winding of a bugle, but whether outside or within the walls, he could not tell; the notes, however, he knew to be Moorish; for it had been a score of years since a Spanish bugle had waked the echoes of the walls of Cordova. `I will ramble up the street,' he said. `All is quiet, and if I see any one, I will retire into the shade, and so avoid them. As a Moor, I may pass on safely to the great square. It will be yet an hour ere the Senor Velez returns!' Thus speaking, he closed the gate after him, and grasping his scymetar firmly, he walked along up the narrow street on the dark side of the way. He was pleased at the beauty of the Moorish edifices, all the outlines of their elaborate architecture, being finely relieved in the light and shadow of the moon-beams. The arched gate-ways, the tall, deep casements, the heavy cornices and battlements, all attracted his eyes, unused to the magnificence of cities. Finding all quiet as he went on, he continued his way until he came to the entrance into the great square. Here the view that met his gaze was splendid beyond conception. The noble mosques, the palaces of the Emirs, the royal Seraglio were all visible at once embracing the vast area in a magnificent and sublime array of terraces and porticoes, columns and domes, towers and miniarets, with a hundred silver crescents, shining like a constellation of moons above all. He stood a moment and contemplated the scene, and in his heart prayed that God would ere long give these palaces once more into the hands of Christian Spain. There were guards both on horse and foot in front of the palace of Abdelasis, but where Alfonzo himself stood, no one was moving. He now saw that the palace in which he had seen Xariffa was not on the square before him, for it was to the north, on his left. By reflecting a moment, he believed he could find its front, and thus by personal inspection, ascertain exactly how strongly it was guarded; and whether, if he could gain access by the casement, he should be able to escape with her some other way. With this object in his mind, he turned out of the square to the left, and by mentally comparing the situation of Senor Velez's abode with the situation of the casement, he was enabled to find the street upon which it fronted. `He went down this street and came to a high wall overhung with foliage, and farther on was a massive gate-way, within which he heard voices. He crossed over, and under cover of the black shadows of the opposite side of the way saw—himself unseen—that this was the enclosure of the palace he sought, and that at its entrance, a guard of four soldiers was placed. Two of them were walking up and down before it, the other two were seated upon a bench, playing in the moonlight at Ta-bish, a popular Moorish game, with date stones. Upon the terrace of the palace, he saw also, two armed figures standing, doubtless, sentries, to prevent the escape of the fair captive. Alfonzo saw at a glance, that it would be impossible for him to rescue his sister alone, and return with her as he had hoped to do, to the mountains, after his own mission to Cordova should be terminated. He went on, however, to the extremity of the lofty wall, in belief that he might find some opening less strongly guarded; but he found no other gate. He was about to turn back, giving up the hope of recovering his sister, and anxious lest she shonld be led by the love and rank of the Caliph to renounce her faith, when his eye fell on a scarlet turban made of wood and painted, suspended over the door of a humble habitation, but a few paces further down the street. His heart bounded with joy and delighted surprise. He recollected that this was the sign of the house of the Moor, Yussef Ben Habib, where Ben Osmin was sojourning with Genilla. He sprung forward with the sudden impulse which his wishes gave to his feet, but as suddenly checked himself: `There are many turban makers in Cardova, and this may not be the shop of Ben Habib. Rut I will not go away till I ascertain. All this while I have been wishing that I knew the street, that I might at least look upon the house where Genilla dwells, and lo, here I have, without doubt, stumbled upon it! I will see her if she be here!' He then looked about him carefully to see that he was not observed, and then stepped across the street to the door, over which hung the scarlet turban. The house was of stone, one story in height, had once been white washed, but was now very dingy with age and neglect, apparently by its exterior, proclaiming the poverty of Ben Habib, whose wife the reader will remember, was chosen by Ben Osmin, as the nurse for his protege Genilla, after he found her wrapped up in the bale of shawls, in the mysterious manner already related. The house was buried in repose, aud seemed to be closely shut up. He resolved, however, to make some demonstrations towards ascertaining if the fair Moorish girl was an inmate of it. He had discovered the name `Yussuf Ben Habib,' written over the top of the door, in Arabic characters, with green chalk. This discovery assured him that this was the house in which Ginella was to be found, if she were in Cordova. To commence beating upon the gate, after the custom of applicants, with Moorish tenements, he did not feel safe in doing, so near the guard at the great gate of the palace enclosure, which was not more than two hundred yards distant. He therefore looked for some way of ingress to the court in the rear, for he knew that all Moorish dwellings had a fountain, and court, and garden, either of larger or smaller dimensions, for every Moslem citizen, however humble, had his fountain for his ablutions, though it be an earthen one; and a court to sit in to take his coffee, though it be but twelve feet square; and a garden to give him shade, though it be not able to hold more than two date trees. At the side of Ben Habib's house, he found the roof terminate in a wall about ten feet in height, over which crept a vine. By the aid of the strong, cordlike tenderils of the vine, he drew himself up to the top of the wall, and descended into a little square court, which was not ten steps either way in length or breadth. In the centre was a brick fountain, shaded by a fig-tree. He advanced a few steps from the wall, and was able to look into the open corridor of the Moor's humble house, upon the paved floor of which, the moonlight streamed like a flood of silver. This corridor was a sort of outer hall, open to the air, and having doors to lead into the front rooms of the dwelling. One of these doors was open, and showed a lamp within, suspended above a bench, on which sat a bald-headed mussulman busily engaged in folding silk and muslin into a suitable form to make turbans. He was a short fat Moor with a full face of good humor and simplicity. Opposite to him was Ben Osmin, reclining on a divan, and talking with Ben Habib. Genilla was not visible, and Alfonzo looked towards a small apartment on the left of Ben Osmin, which, he believed, held her from his wistful gaze. He advanced a step noiselessly, and bent forward, hoping that she might be screened only by the half-open door of the room in which they were; but he could not discover her. A word or two from Ben Habib arrested his ear, and he instantly became interested in the conversation. `And this is all true that the Christian hermit told you, brother,' was the remark of Ben Habib, looking up from his work, and fixing his small, keen Moorish eyes on the face of Ben Osmin. `Yes, brother. He came to me on purpose to tell me this. And I see it all now. I can see how that priest Paulus used to try and make a Christian of her, till I told him I would make him a head shorter if he spoke to Genilla of the cross of the Nazarene again. I see it all, but I love her not a whit less because she has Christian blood in her veins.' `How strange that a Christian monk should have sent to thee a Christian infant to keep. He might have known she would have grown up to be a follower of the true Prophet, for which Allah be thanked. Did he tell you who her mother was or her father?' `No; he came to me three days ago, and told me that this Paulus, whom we thought such a good Moslem, had told him, that the infant I had received in a bale of shawls was the daughter of Christian parents of high rank; that its life had been saved by him only by the most extraordinary exertions on his part, when all her race perished, and that finding he could not protect it longer, and knowing my goodness of heart, (for he paid me this compliment, Ben Habib; and deserved too,' remarked the turban-maker, parenthetically,) he sent her to me in the manner you have often been told. Since then he has watched over her as a Moslem and Mufti, though at heart he was a Nazarene. He said that Paulus did not intend she should remain with me any longer than he could find a safe asylum for her, for fear of her becoming a Moslem; but circumstances prevented his giving her his protection; and last week he died, telling father Godfrey these things.' `And yet this Paulus as a Moslem, used to come and try to make her a Christian, you say.' `I have my suspicions that he did; but I never liked to trust a converted Christian, and so I had my eye upon him, and finally forbade him the Emir's tower.' `Well, what is to be done?' `The father Godfrey, who seems to be a good man for a Christian, told me that the maiden was very rich, and that if I would come to Cordova he would point out where the wealth was secreted, and give me half of it if I would surrender Genilla to him.' `On my soul be it,—this was a request.' `It was. I pretended to assent to this —though I would part with my life sooner than with my Genilla, though she had all the Christian blood of Jerusalem in her veins.' `She is no worse a Moslem for that, brother.' `No. I deceived the holy hermit, and came hither where he said he would meet me, and unfold to me the wealth of which Genilla has been so long deprived. He should have been here to-night by his promise,' answered Ben Osmin, looking towards the street door, and listening.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XX. THE MERCHANT AND HIS GUEST. There was a moment's pause in the conversation, during which Alfonzo had time to reflect rapidly upon the wonderful intelligence which he had heard.— Genilla was then of Christian birth, and not the daughter of Ben Osmin the Moor. This discovery filled his bosom with delight. There was now no further obstacle to the free progress of his love for the fair young girl; for he felt that he had only to reveal to her this truth, to make her a willing convert to the faith of her fathers. That the fact was as the conversation he had overheard led him to see it, he could not doubt. But he resolved to see the hermit and learn from him the whole, confessing his attachment to her and persuading him to unfold her history. He now understood why father Godfrey had made that mysterious visit to the Emir's tower; and in his heart he said,—`He will no longer be displeased with me for gazing on the tower and thinking upon the fair occupant of the cottage by its walls; he will gladly assent to our union, hoping, as I hope, that through me she be restored to the fold of the church.' Suddenly the voice of Ben Habib roused him from his pleasing meditations. `How much gold think you, brother, the maiden has?' `That I know not; the hermit said it was a large sum in gold and jewels, which Paulus had hidden for her in some safe place in Cordova, where it had remained twenty years.' `I would I had found it. What do you mean to do when he gives thee half, and refuse to give up the maiden to him?' `I will tell him I will keep Genilla for the other half which I make over to him. This will be fair dealing, brother, with a Christian dog!' `It is no harm, but rather a virtue, to deceive them. But he may not let thee have the gold till he have thy daughter. But hist!—the maiden may be listening.' `No—she sleeps soundly; I saw that before we began our talk.' `It would be bad to be overheard by her, as she might play against us.' `She loves me too well; she would not leave me, brother Ben Habib. It would break her little heart.' `I have no doubt of it!—But surely I heard a noise!' cried the little turban-maker, as he glanced around with a quick, searching glance. He did hear a noise—it was the footstep of Alfonzo, who, finding that he could learn nothing more, and that Genilla was asleep and in safety, recollecting his engagement with Senor Velez, retired from the corridor, but not without striking a loose brick of the paved floor. He rapidly sealed the wall, and lighted undiscovered in the street, along which he moved rapidly, to hasten back to the merchant's house. He had made happy discoveries during the two hours' absence of Senor Velez:—he had found where Xariffa was imprisoned, and that she rather loved her cage than desired to be stolen from it!—he had found Genilla, and learned not only her safety, but that she had now claims to his regard more sacred and stronger than ever. He took his way with a light tread along the street, and so wholly wrapped in the sweet thoughts of Genilla that he came unexpectedly upon two men at the corner of a street into which he was turning. He stepped back and drew his scymetar—the foremost stranger did the same. They confronted each other for a momeat in hostile attitude, the third standing a little behind the second, when Alfonzo thought he recognised the height and air of the latter. `Art thou not Senor Velez?' he said. `Yes; and thou?' `Alfonzo!' `Rash young man! How is it that I find you in the street?' `I was weary remaining at home, Senor, and invited by the moonlight I rambled forth. I have met with no mishap and have found all quiet!' `That was not your fault, my friend. Come we will hasten homeward.' `Is not this the way?' `Not as you were going. You see how imprudent you are, my noble friend. You might have been lost; and as guards of horsemen patrol the street every hour you would certainly have been arrested and discovered. I am glad I met with thee! Let us hasten homeward.' `Have you brought good tidings, Senor?' asked Alfonzo, suddenly forgetting Genilla, Xariffa and every thing but Spain and her wrongs! `Yes! I have given the news to ten brave and true men. Ere this they have conveyed it to ten more. By sun-rise a thousand Christian slaves in Cordova will know that Alfonzo the Destroyer has resolved to lift the standard of the Cross on the eve of San Diego upon the rock of St. Paul. The news will go from lip to lip till a fire shall run through all the veins of the bondmen of our blood in the city. They will keep the secret and await the signal to srike for Spain and liberty!' Thanks, thanks, noble Velez! I am already inspired by thy tidings,' answered Alfonzo, as he walked homeward with him, the Nubian slave following close behind him with his no longer needful lantern in his hand. Upen entering the house, and once more being seated, Senor Velez gave a minute relation of what he had done which convinced Alfonzo that he should receive the co-operation of almost as many strong arms within the walls of the Moors as without. He then related to the Senor his own adventures and even unfolded to him his love for Genilla now that he could speak of her as the daughter of Christian parents. The merchant heard him with profound surprise. He said, after some reflection, `What you have told me amazes me —all of it! But I trust that your sister does not feel as kindly towards Abdelasis as you suspect. Doubtless she consulted more your safety than her own in refusing to permit you to risk your life in trying to save her! And if you had done so where could you have taken her? If you had brought her here she would have been discovered by the emissaries of the Caliph. If you had escaped from the city with her in disguise it would have been to desert a cause which calls for all your energies and devotion.' `True!' `Forget her and give your thoughts to your country, Alfonzo!' `I will do so!' `Yet one word touching this daughter of Ben Osmin! Said you that the father Godfrey did not know her parentage?' `He did not name it to Ben Osmin. Doubtless he was informed by Paulus!' `I knew this priest Paulus well. He was confessor to the late Duke de Cordova brother to our good King Amalarie, whose memory Heaven bless forever. Paulus was a faithful adherent of the House of Amalarie and for years after the slaughter of the king and his household by the order of the Emir Taric I supposed he had shared their fate. But seven years ago I met him as I was travelling up the valley near the Pass of Roncesvar.' `He was habited as a recluse. He told me he lived in the mountains, and devoted his life to the returning glory of Spain. Since then I have heard nothing of him till now. And now I hear that he died a few days ago, leaving behind, in the ears of father Godfrey, this singular revelation. Do you know, Alfonzo, that I have my suspicions!' said Senor Velez, with a significant look and an animated air. `And I mine!' `What are they?' `That Genilla may belong to some one of the noble houses connected with the Duke de Cordova!' `More than this. I believe, from her age and your description of her, that she is the daughter of the Duke himself, saved by Paulus from death, at the risk of his own life, and placed with a Moor for preservation, as once a dying mother laid her infant in the midst of a litter of lion's whelps!' `Had the Duke a daughter who was then an infant?' `Yes; I was at its christening. It was believed to have perished.' `Genilla must be that infant, I feel persuaded!' `So also do I. I will draw the whole matter from father Godfrey. If it be true, then Spain has a Princess at least, and may hold up her head!' `And I droop mine own. For how will a princess look upon a peasant's love?' `Thy union may yet be ordered by Heaven as the salvation of the realm. If she be a princess, indeed, she can have no kindom, save by thy prowess. But let these matters rest till we see father Godfrey. He will doubtless unfold all to me!' At this moment was heard a tapping upon the outside of the street-gate. As it was some time past midnight, Senor Velez looked surprised, and rose himself to go to the gate before ordering his slave to open it. `Open, my good lord,' said the visitor. `It is Athir!' exclaimed Alfonzo, who had gone to the wicket with him. The gate was then unbarred and the youthful Moor admitted. He wore the dress of a royal page, a very elegant and graceful costume, which set his figure off to the best advantage. His turban was of pink silk entwined with a scarf of spangled muslin; his bernish was of bright yellow satin, bound with a gold border; and his vest was blue velvet, spangled with stars. He wore full muslin drawers, that nearly hid in the ample volume his red morocco gilt slippers. About his waist was bound a green sash, in which was stuck a silver-hilted yataghan and a jewelled dagger. `How is this fine display, Athir? You have made your two pieces of gold go a great ways,—your costume is worth a hundred bezets!' exclaimed Alfonzo, surveying him. `I bought a coarser garb at the bazaar, my lord,' answered Athir, who seemed to be conscious how well he looked with his fine face and manly figure, to set off his rich costume; `but not liking it well, I went into the pages' bed-chamber, and while the idle rogues slept, I helped myself to the best suit among them that I could find; and donning it, I felt much more at my ease.' `Then you went into the palace of the Caliph?' `All over it, my lord, wheresoever a page's slipper is permitted to echo. I talked with many, and especially had a social talk with old Belzar, the chief eunuch, who was as communicative as I could desire;—and the result is, I am satisfied that Xariffa is not in the harem of the Seraglio.' `You have performed your duty well and faithfully, Athir: Xariffa is found— she is in the private palace of Abdelasis, which is not far distant on the next street.'</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XXI. THE MEETING OF THE LONG-SEVERED. At the intelligence thus unexpectedly conveyed to him, Athir manifested his surprise and pleasure. `Allah be praised!' he cried: `I will aid my lord in recovering her.' `And, perhaps, you can aid me, Athir,' answered Alfonzo, after a moment's reflection. He then briefly stated how he had discovered her, and his fears that if she were suffered to remain longer in the power and presence of Abdelasis she might return his love for her. `Are you confident in your disguise?' asked Alfonzo. `It has saved me from detection in the Seraglio itself, my lord. But I have here a talisman.' `What is this?' asked Alfonzo, as he took from his hand a large signet. `It is what I have seen often,' interposed Senor Velez: `it is the Caliph's private seal.' `It is, my lord,' answered Athir, as Alfonzo fastened on him a glance of surprise and inquiry. `I took it from his own chamber, for he was absent—doubtless at the palace of his captive. I saw it there, and took it without much reflection about it—but believing that it might be of service to thee.' `It was a bold act, and may be useful. Can you gain admittance into the palace with it?' `Without doubt, my lord.' `Then go and see Xariffa, and say to her from whom you come, and urge her to fly with you to the Sierras. Will you not accompany her?' `Wherever my noble benefactor commands. I will do all I can to save her; if she will not come with me, I will re turn to you. What token shall I give her to prove that you sent me?' `Take this key—it is known to her.' The youthful Moor was going out upon his mission, when Senor Velez said to him,— `When thou returnest, come by the way of the gardens; yonder gate on the other side of the court will let thee in and shall be left unhasped for thee.— The gardens are the Caliph's, who, when Emir, let those who dwelt around them walk in them at certain hours daily.' Athir was then let out by the street door, and was departing, when a troop of the mounted city guard came galloping by. He quickly drew within the gate and when their retiring hoofs were heard at a distance, he again sallied forth. Leaving Alfonzo to discuss farther the details of the contemplated revolution which was to place Spain once more under the Christian rule, we will follow the disguised page to the gate of the palace where Alfonzo had seen the four guards stationed. He presented his signet boldly, and was at once admitted with great respect. A slave was called, who conducted him to the corridor of the palace where the chief eunuch received him and led him through a suite of magnificent halls towards the apartments occupied by Xariffa. Athir had adroitly ascertained at the gate that the Caliph had a long time before departed to his royal palace on the great square. Upon reaching the ante-room to her apartments, the eunuch said, bowing his head to the ground in the presence of the Caliph's messenger: `Does my lord Effendi wish to see the Christian slave in person, or speak with one of her attendants, and through he convey his Highness' message to the maiden.' `I will see her—go and announce me. The eunuch advanced, and lifting a massive curtain of gold and silk, heavily woven in gorgeous figures, he revealed a columed chamber, with alabaster panel exquisitely painted with birds of the richest plumage. The floor was mosaic, and the roof frescoed in the highest style of Moorish art, blue and gold contrasting with white being the prevailing colors. At the extremity of this beautiful apartment, upon a raised dais overlaid with the most costly and brilliant colors, sat Xariffa, the half-willing, half-trembling captive of the powerful Abdelasis. At her feet, a little removed, crouched in an attitude of natural grace, sat the beautiful Arabian maid her attendant, whom Alfonzo had seen appear at the casement, and warn her of the approach of the Prince after his serenade. She had a roquelin, or Moorish guitar, in her hands, upon the strings of which her taper fingers were arrested by the appearance of the eunuch, towards whom she turned her large black eyes enquiringly. Xariffa had been listening to the sweet voice of the young girl, who was singing, or rather improvising, a tale of love in her own experience, accompanying the romantic and touching narrative with a thrilling touch now and then upon the strings of her guitar. `Christian, a message from the Caliph,' said the eunuch, speaking with the machine-like action of an automaton. `I do not wish any message of the Prince but one, to tell me that I am free,' answered Xariffa with spirit. `He must not come in unless he brings such.— Come, maiden, go on with thy sad story: tell me if thy father, the chief, never relented when he found thou didst so mourn the handsome youth, whom love for thee compelled to flee.' `No, lady—he was austere and cruel after this, and made me a prisoner in his own mountain hold. But true love has its own power. I escaped, and in disguise of a youth reached, after many hapless wanderings, these shores of Spain. Here I hoped I might find him who was dearer to me than the sun is to the green earth.' `And has thou ne'er met him?' `No, lady, but I have heard that he was a page to the Emir Algezir and afterwards became a wanderer in the Sierras! I know not where he is now!' `And how is it thou art the slave of Abdelasis?' `I was his page, also, till a month ago when, as I slept, my vest opening exposed my bosom. He made me tell him my whole story, and when he had listened attentively to it, he bade me take courage for if Athir were alive I should yet behold him; for he said nothing would give him so much happi ness as to see me united to him I had so faithfully loved. I have since been honorably entreated in the palace where I served as page; and yesterday when he brought thee hither he bade me please him by endeavoring to make thee happy and to love him!' `He is nobler than I believed. Thou has taken off one half my dislike to him for his kindness to thee. Here comes the Eunuch again to interrupt us! Sir Eunuch, it is past midnight; and because I choose to sit up and watch the moon I am not compelled to receive at such an hour the Caliph's messengers.' `He comes of his own will, Christian,' answered the Eunuch, standing aside and letting Athir advance. `Say to Abdelasis, fair page,' cried Xariffa, rising, `that this is not fulfilling his promise given me when he left, that I should not be intruded upon ere to-morrow! Ha! what is this? What has happened, child? How wildly you stare! Who—' Her words of surprise were interrupted by a loud shriek of heart heart breaking joy from the bosom of the Arabian girl and a cry of gladness co-mingling with it from the lips of the noble looking youth. `Nube!' `Athir!' These two words uttered with accents of the deepest-toned human, joy told her the whole story of lovers parted and and meeting again. Nube made but one bound to reach the approaching arms of Athir and her head sunk lifeless upon his shoulder while her arms clung around him as if she would never release her hold again. `My Nube! My long-lost, found Nube!' articulated Athir, with tender joy, as he gazed down upon her face and folded her again and again to his heart. Xariffa gazed upon this scene of happiness with tearful eyes and a smile sparkling upon her countenance. In a few minutes Nube slowly raised her face all smiles and tears, and dishevelled tresses, and said softly to her, and oh, what a world to her in those two syllables, `Athir!' and then she once more buried her face in his bosom!' The breathless questioning, the explanations, the thousand expressions of grateful joy, to all of which Xariffa listened, that followed this happy re-union who shall record! The bliss of the lovers was complete. It seemed to them that there was no sorrow on earth. At length Xariffa said to the happy lover, `You will now hasten and inform the Caliph of your discovery, that he may rejoice with you!' `Alas, lady,' said Nube, `he cannot rejoice save you smile on him! Be not cruel! Let an hour so blessed to me and to Athir be also blessed to the Prince and to you.' `Nay, sweet Nube,' interposed Athir, with a smile; `I cannot have you urge the lady to favor the Prince! I am not in the service of Abdelasis!' `In whose?' asked Xariffa, with surprise. Athir briefly related his history as it is already known to the reader, up to the time of his being ushered into the apartment by the Eunuch. He spoke freely and with confidence knowing he was with those who would not betray him. When Xariffa heard his message to her she sighed, and said, `I cannot go with you! Nor will you wish to leave Nube to escape with me!' `She can go with us!' `No, it is your duty to remain here with her, and to-morrow let the Prince learn from her lips who you are. He will rejoice. I will intercede with him to pardon you for taking his signet, which you will now give me; and return at once to Alfonzo and tell him that I— I—' Here the Christian maiden hesitated and blushed. `I will end the sentence for thee, lady,' answered Nube, smiling; `tell him that you love the Prince Abdelasis and mean to make him happy by sharing his throne and heart.' `No—no—' `Yes! It is so! I see it, lady!' answered Athir. For Alfonzo's sake only am I sorry! He will grieve to hear it!' `Nay, I have not said that I love Abdelasis!' `No—words are less eloquent than thy throbbing bosom and beaming eye as he is spoken of!' `Tell my brother that I feel that I can prevail upon the Caliph to embrace Christianity!' `Allah forbid!' ejaculated both the Arabian girl and her lover. Xariffa smiled at their earnestness, and said. `Go, Athir. To-morrow at noon come hither, and the Prince will receive thee, and thou shalt be made happy and Nube too!' `What shall I say to Alfonzo?' `Urge him to caution lest he should be discovered; and tell him that I know the Prince will treat me with all honour. Urge him to return to the mountains where in two days he will either see or hear from me! Athir embraced Nube tenderly, and then took his leave of Xariffa with a heavy cloud shadowing his happy heart. He bore the news to Alfonzo; and the brow of the brother darkened, and his vengeance against Abdelasis was awakened anew. But when Athir told him of his meeting with Nube, the brow of anger relaxed, and he shewed by the expression of his smiling face, that he sympathized fully in the happiness of his friend.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XXII. THE CRISIS OF THE CONSPIRACY. The eve of St. James at length arrived, a season to be marked with great events —the downfall of the crescent and the elevation of the cross. The emissaries which had departed from Alfonzo in the forest, to rouse up the Christians in the mountains, and in the plains, were everywhere received with joy and hailed as messengers of deliverance. The name of Alfonzo had preceded them to the remotest recesses of the vallies, and been heard by the farthest mountaineer. It carried with it a prestige that favored the messengers. Every where men were told that Alfonzo the Destroyer was to raise again the standard of the cross on the eve of St. James, their eyes brightened, they shook off their slavish indifference, and grasping their rude weapons, desired to be led against the Moor. The edict issned by Abdelasis, calling for the registering of every man's name, also contributed to this willingness to take up arms against the Moslem. They saw that now was the crisis of their nation's destiny; that the edict must be resisted— that Spain must be made free. From hamlet to hamlet, from cabin to cabin the fifty emissaries went bearing the wooden cross, and raising the startling cry. `Up Christians of Spain! The standard of the cross is to be lifted up by the hand of Alfonzo the Destroyer. Up Christians of Spain. The eve of St. James is to be the eve of our national glory. Arm, Christians of Spain. Hasten to the rock of St. Paul on the eve of St. James. God and Spain! down with the Moor. With such words as these did those zealous mountaineers who had caught the spirit of Alfonzo, spread the news of the contemplated movement. No where did they meet with indifference. The fire spread and warmed every heart, and nerved every arm. Yet all was done secretly and unknown to the Moor. Each Christian sacredly kept his own council; and there, in the very bosom of the Saracen empire, was gathering a storm-cloud, which, to the eyes of the Infidel, cast not a shadow upon the land. All was sunshine and peace. Abdelasis had consolidated the kingdom. He was a descendant of the Prophet, and vice-general of the Faith of the crescent. Mo one thought now of questioning his authority, or of opposing his power. To Moorish Spain there seemed rising a glory greater than ever shone over the Moslem empire of Syria. The holy father Godfrey was also a messenger; but he went rather to the exiled priests in the recesses of the mountains than to the peasantry, though he passed none by. These priests became emissaries in their turn, and aroused the nobles who were to be found buried in their strong-holds, or dwelling in poverty and degradation in the northern towns of the Moorish empire. The cry went like electric fire from lip to lip, and met with the most thrilling welcome. `The eve of San Diego' was on every tongue, blended with the proudly uttered name of Alfonzo the Destroyer. Every man felt that a leader was now needed, or all Spain would have to bend its neck to the yoke of slavery, and to the faith of of Mahommet. In the city of Cordova Senor Velez, and his friends had not been idle. The intelligence which he had spread found willing hearts to receive it. Affection for the Cross and a desire for the returning glory of Spain inspired the bosoms of those who had long been slaves. Secretly sixteen thousand men prepared to rise upon their conquerors and masters as soon as the trumpet of Alfonzo should be heard at midnight without the walls, proclaiming his presence with an army. Alfonzo had held frequent secret meetings, at the house of Senor Velez, with the principal Christians in the city, and chosen his leaders of division and regularly organised the masses, so that they should act with harmony and effect. To one was given the assault on the Royal Palace; to another, to attack the armory, a round tower near the city; to another, to occupy one square and the streets leading to it; and to another division, another square. Some parties were to occupy the several palaces, and the chief party to attack the principal gate on the inner side, and endeavor to open it for the entrance of Alfonzo and his army. Having made all these arrangements with great wisdom and an almost innate knowledge of military affairs, Alfonzo, after remaining four days in Cordova, returned from the city to the hamlet. Here he found Gaspar, who was in the midst of a body-guard of four hundred mountaineers secretly gathered together; and from him he learned that these could be depended on a force of at least twelve thousand armed men. He now ascended to the Rock of St. Paul's, which commanded a wide view of all the valley of the Guadalquiver and the city of Cordova, and here in the presence of these men he constructed, by their aid, a wooden cross, which the father Godfrey, who now never left the side of his young friend, blessed and consecrated for this purpose. The cross was whitened, and being, when erect, thirty feet in height, could be seen at a great distance. The eve of St. James (or San Diego) was now ten days distant. Alfonzo having devoted the three next days, during which armed detachments were constantly coming in by the mountain roads, to the selection of his officers and the arrangement of the plan of the revolution, which he as effectually organised in the Sierras as he had done within the city, he resolved once more to revisit Cordova in diguise. Before deperting, he gave directions that all who needed provisions should be supplied from his herd of goats and gazelles first, and then from those of the other herdsmen on the Sierras, who willingly gave them up to the great cause to which they had devoted life and wealth. Father Godfrey accompanied him to Cordova, and both reached the abode of Senor Velez in safety. Alfonzo had now leisure to make inquiries of the hermit touching the birth of Genilla, and from him, to his surprise, learned that she was, as the merchant had suspected, the daughter of the Duke de Cordava and the sole heiress to the throne of Spain. The intelligence rendered the young lover despondent, for he felt that when she came to know her rank and (if the revolution was successful) to be elevated to the sceptre of the empire, she would disdain his humble love! But in these apprehensions he was deceived. Father Godfrey called upon Ben Osmin, at the abode of Habib, and having been permitted to have a private interview with Genilla, he unfolded to her the secret of her lineage. Her surprise gave place to deep reflection; and she at length said, `Have you told Ben Osmin, my father, of this?' `No. It would not be safe. Spain looks to you for safety and security. Alfonzo loves you. Embrace the faith of your father's and become the wife of Alfonzo, and let him, in your name, raise once more the standard of your royal ancestors.' The result of the interview was a desire on her part to see Alfonzo. They met privately the same evening while the hermit, taking Ben Osmin and Yusauf Habib with him, went to show them the hidden treasure that he would bestow upon the former to surrender his daughter. The eloquence and love of Alfonzo prevailed. Convinced that she was the child of a Christian race, the daughter of Christian kings, she promised to embrace the faith of the Cross in the great principles of which she had already been instructed not only the priest Paulus, but by Alfonzo himself. From this hour her destiny and line of life was separated from that of Ben Osmin. She felt that the parting would be painful, but she was firm in uniting her destinies with those of Alfonzo and Spain. Ben Osmin returned laden with jewels, and the hermit demanded Genilla. But Ben Osmin laughed and told him that he might have the other half left in the vaults of the old ruin of the Duke of Cordova's castle they had visited, and he would keep the maiden. Father Godfrey protesting, Ben Osmin menaced him with a complaint to the Caliph for hiding the wealth of Christian nobles. Genilla hearing this, became displeased, but remained silent. The same night she was under Alfonzo protection in the house of Senor Velez, and there in the presence of a score of the chief conspirators she was baptized, partook of the Holy Communion, and then receiving the sign of the cross, was solemnly united in marriage with Alfonzo. Spain now had a leader of right to conduct her to victory and to power.— The intelligence spread from mouth to mouth, and from the city reached the assembled forces in the mountains. It gave new life to the revolution. Men felt that now they had something to fight for— an end to crown their efforts. In the meanwhile, Xariffa remained an inmate of the palace of Abdelasis. He had called the next day to see her, and was surprised and overjoyed at the condescension of her reception. When he heard from her lips the romantic narrative of Nube, he was greatly pleased, and promised to forgive Athir, who at that moment came in. The Prince then made him give an account of his adventures, which he did— save that portion, which related to his service with Alfonzo, upon which he remained silent. The Prince, however pardoned Athir at Xariffa's solicitation only on the condition that she would reciprocate his love for her, and consent to become his wife. `If you will, Xariffa,' he said, `I promise that the edict whieh you so deeply lament and censure me for, shall be revoked, and that your people shall share the privileges of citizens equally with mine.' `I consent, on condition that you will permit the Christians in Cordova to worship in their cathedral, and suffer a cross to be erected upon its dome, where now shines the crescent.' `I consent to this, fair Xariffa. Now you see that I truly love you, and honour you.' `Have I your royal word that these things shall be as I ask?' `I give you my word as Prince and Caliph, beautiful maiden, beloved ef my soul.' `Then I consent to by thy wife, Abdelasis; this sacrifice of my religious objections to thy faith, I am willing to make to remove from my people the heavy yoke that thou wouldst have put upon them.' The next day the marriage of Xariffa with the Caliph, was solemnized in the Great Mosque with public rejoicing.— Alfonzo heard of it in the Siarras at Paul's Rock, and was pained to the heart at this seeming manifestation of her falsity to her faith and country. But Athir, who also was made happy by being the same day made the husband of Nube, came to him from the now Moorish Princess, and made made known to him her motives. `It is too late for such a sacrifice to do any good!' he answered, sadly.— `The sword is drawn and must not be sheated till Spain be free.' But Abdelasis proved false to his royal pledge. He put off from day to day the revocation of his edict. The eve of San Diego arrived! Alfonzo stood upon the Rock of St. Paul, and beheld around him an army of forty thousand men, for so readily and warmly had Spain responded to the call upon her. The moon was just rising over the peak of Corol when mounted upon his charger, he marched at the head of his forces against the walls of Cordova, two leagues distant. Already had Abdelasis got rumour of the assembling of forces for a day past in the Sierras, and he was preparing an army to sally out upon them, not suspecting their purpose, or guessing at their number.— But as he was in his saddle, reviewing his troops, in the Great Square, as the moon rose over the peak of Corol, El Zegris came dashing up at full speed and said— `My Prince, pardon me! I am now thy vassal. I have come into the city to aid thee in its defence, and was admitted at the gate, leaving my followers, three hundred men without. Do I live?' `Thou art pardoned!' `Now then, I have news for thee!— Alfonzo, the destroyer, is assembled at the head of thirty thousand armed Christians, and is preparing to storm the city. This intelligence may be relied on.' The Prince, amazed to learn that a force, which he supposed to consist at the most, of ten or fifteen hundred men, was thus menacing him, under a leader so formidable, at once called all the citizens to arms! But in vain to save Cordova and his crown. Abdelasis had no sooner got before the four gates, in four divisions, than he sounded his trumpets. In a moment, sixteen thousand slaves were in arms in the bosom of the city. Taken by surprise, the Moors were panic-stricken.— The gates were carried—Alfonzo entered at the head of ten thousand men, and swept the city. Abdelasis was taken prisonor, and El Zegris slain by the hand of Alfonzo. Zariffa perished by the hands af the Moorish officers of the palace who charged her with having been the mover of the revolution. The whole city, with every strong-hold, fell into the hands of the Christians. Those in the country followed, and every where the banner of the cross, prevailed over the fallen crescent. Spain was made free! The Moors fled to their ships, or were made slaves to their conquerors. Addelasis was beheaded on the terrace of his own palace. Alfonzo, with his royal bride, Genilla, was proclaimed King of Spain, and the Triumph of Liberty, and of the Cross over the Crescent, and Moslem bondage, was complete. THE END.</field>
