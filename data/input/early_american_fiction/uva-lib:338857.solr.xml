      <field name="fulltext">I. THE DOCTOR. A man was sitting in a house on Gloucester Street, in Williamsburg, Virginia, about a hundred years ago, busy at a very singular employment. In this lower world the inner character of men and things connects itself so mysteriously with their outward appearance, that a pen-and-ink sketch is desirable of the room in which the personage we have introduced was sitting, and of the personage himself. It was the front apartment of a small house, standing somewhat back from the street, in the midst of a small garden, given up chiefly to flowers; and, as the season was autumn, the borders burned with prince's - feathers, asters, yellow primroses, and late geraniums. You approached by a gravel-walk, mounted two stone steps, entered by a heavy door, ornamented with an enormous brass lock, and, passing through an inner door on the right, found yourself in the apartment mentioned. It was half sitting-room, half laboratory. A thick carpet, with lozenge-shaped figures of black and red alternately, covered the floor, and some old, high - backed chairs rested against the dingy walls. In one corner was a walnut-wood bookease, containing an array of volumes, chiefly upon medi cal subjects, and these had overflowed upon the chairs and the carpet. On the tall mantel-piece were jars, phials, retorts, and bones. It was plain that physiology was a favorite study of the owner of the mansion; and specimens of the master-worm, man, in every stage of his physical development, from the embryo to the skeleton, dangling its legs and arms, and grinning frightfully, met the eye on every hand. In the centre of the room stood a long table, covered with machines and retorts. Beside it, poring, with knit brows, over a large leather-bound volume, and looking, from moment to moment, at a white rabbit under a glass cover, sat the master of the establishment. He was an altogether singular personage—a sort of cut-off giant, scarcely five feet in height, with an enormous chest, broad and powerful shoulders, and long arms, ending in immense hands. Here, however, the Herculean character of the strange figure terminated. An impotent conclusion ensued. The legs were actual pipe-stems, so slender were they; and their tenuity was exaggerated by the enormous size of the feet, reposing in mighty buckled shoes. The costume of this personage consisted of heavy silk stockings, knee-breeches of drab cloth, a long waistcoat reaching nearly to the knees, and buttoned up to the throat; and a species of overcoat with a cape attached, capacious flapped pockets, and skirts so long that they reached down to the wearer's heels. Neck, this outré figure had none, apparently. The huge head, half covered by long, gray elf-locks, rose abruptly from the shoulders, and the face was on a par with the torso. The eyes were dark, piercing, and seemed to burn with cynical fire under the bushy, gray eyebrows. The nose was long and prominent; the mouth wide, with thin, compressed lips, and a sardonic, almost sneering expression. From time to time the personage uttered a sort of grunt, agreeably alternating with a growl resembling that of a wolf disturbed while tearing his food. He closed the book, and raised the glass cover, beneath which was stretched the body of the rabbit—a white one of the English species. “Well,” he said, in a vibrating and metallic voice, “he is dead, after all, I think. The formula was wrong. To be certain, however.” He took the white rabbit, and, opening the window, placed it upon the sill in the fresh air. For ten minutes he remained looking attentively at it. No movement indicated life. “Humph!” he said; “yes, this time he's dead. Decidedly the formula was wrong. And yet—it is my dream, perchance, but no—this is not a chimera. And, if not—” He looked toward the skeleton, and, shaking his fist at it, exclaimed, in grim and triumphant tones: “I cannot conquer you, King Death! My science is powerless in face of your strength—you are master! But I do not yield; I can fight you, drive you back; and, if not checkmate you, can sometimes tear your prey from your grasp! If I find what I seek now, I triumph!—and I will find it!—Yes, the formula was wrong— there is a better—yonder!” And, crossing the room with hasty strides, he took down a heavy volume from the bookcase. As he did so, there fell from the shelf, where it had been concealed behind the volume, a small white glove, with a bow of blue ribbon affixed to the wrist—only the delicate fabric, once snow-white, was discolored by age, and the ribbon-knot was faded. The eccentric personage picked up the glove and looked at it. An expression of wonder had replaced the stern glance. “This here!” he muttered—“not crumbled and gone to dust like all else?” He remained perfectly motionless for a long time, looking at the glove, upon which a ray of the autumn sunshine fell, through the window. An expression of sadness, almost of tenderness, had come to the deep-set eyes now, and the thin lips. “I thought that was all done for— that business!” he muttered; “and yet here it is!—a ghost out of the past.— What a fool I am!—The roses are as faded as the blue of this ribbon; and the woman—she has forgotten!” The pathetic expression had already disappeared, and the sardonie smile came back. “Here I am, dreaming over a woman's glove!” he muttered; “the old squat dwarf, with his patients to look after! I'll cease this fooling!—go back to your hiding-place, ghost!” he said, replacing the glove behind the books; “I'll never summon you again or look at her, unless she calls me. `Send to me if you are in trouble,' I said to her, `and I'll come, day or night.' I'll do that— but she shall send for me first.” Muttering to himself, he went back with his book to the table; at the moment, a clock in the adjoining room struck the hour of noon. “Well, here's the morning wasted, and I must go to the governor,” he said, closing his book.—“Snuffers!” This cabalistic word died away, and was then repeated in a louder tone: “Snuffers!” “Very well, Dr. Vandyke!” a voice said from the next room; “there's no use bawling at me—I'm coming.” The door opened, and an old woman of short stature, rotund person, and ruddy face, appeared, her white head-kerchief extending backward in the shape of a sugar-loaf. “Most excellent Mrs. Snuffers,” said Dr. Vandyke, with his satirical smile, “will you be so obliging as to inform any person who calls to see me that I have gone to the governor's?” “And when will you be back?” “I am unable to say, madam.” Thereat the elderly lady looked peculiarly irate. “And how am I to know when you will want your dinner, Dr. Vandyke? How am I to take care of you, and act as a Christian woman by you, when here, just as I am getting ready to put the dinner on the table, you go flying off!” Dr. Vandyke glared at his enemy. “Dinner?” he said. “Dinner!” retorted the foe, in a loud voice—“dinner! and I'd like to know how often I have said—” “That eating was the great object of existence? A thousand times, most respectable Snuffers! True, life is after all but a struggle against starvation. All else but what the human animal eats is vanity! And the fact here stated is susceptible of demonstration. From the singular organization of the creature denominated man—” Unfortunately for the doctor's learned discourse, an instant interruption thereof occurred. Breathless, pop-eyed, with haste written all over his face, rushed in a small black urchin, who nearly precipitated himself into the doctor's arms. That gentleman received him with immovable elbow, sharp and bony, which sent him flying back. “What's the meaning of this, you rascal?” quoth Dr. Vandyke. The boy cowered and fell back. But in a moment he regained breath and courage to deliver his message. A gentleman, while riding along Gloucester Street, had been thrown from his horse, badly injured, and borne into the Raleigh Tavern, where he awaited Dr. Vandyke's professional services. “Say I am coming,” grunted Dr. Vandyke. “And your dinner!” shrilled Mrs. Snuffers. The doctor wheeled and scowled at her. “Snuffers!—you are a pair of extinguishers instead of the implement bearing your name. That is to say, you are —a woman!” Having discharged this thunder-bolt at the head of his enemy, Dr. Vandyke put on his hat, grasped a large stick in his vigorous right hand, and, with his long overcoat flapping against his shrunken legs, went out of the house, and toward the Raleigh Tavern.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">II. A FALL FROM HORSEBACK. At the moment when Dr. Vandyke had unburdened his mind by shaking his fist at the skeleton, a man had passed along Gloucester Street, at full gallop, on a black horse of great strength and speed. The man was apparently about thirty-five, erect, sinewy, though rather thin, and clad in a dark riding-suit and elegant riding-boots. His face was handsome and distinguished, but remarkable for its pallor, which his black hair rendered more striking. His seat in the saddle was that of an excellent horseman, but he had allowed the bridle to fall on the neck of his horse; and the dreamy expression of his eyes indicated that he was sunk in a profound reverie. The result of this was unfortunate. In passing the door of the Virginia Gazette office, a young man, whose back was turned to him, suddenly unfolded a number of the paper, just handed to him by a boy; and the black horse shied violently, unseating and throwing his rider, whose head struck heavily against the stones of the street. The young man, who had inadvertently caused the accident, hastened to the assistance of the fallen horseman and raised him in his arms. He was quite insensible, and the blood flowed from a deep gash in his temple. A crowd immediately collected.— While some endeavored unsuccessfully to stop the black horse, which galloped off, the rest gathered around the fallen man, shutting off the fresh air. All at once, however, the throng divided, and was thrust back. A tall, bony serving-man, with a face like bronze, hastened to throw his arms around the victim of the accident. The new-comer paid no attention to the youth. Raising the unconscious form in his arms, he bore it into the Raleigh Tavern, which was only a few paces distant, and, ascending the narrow staircase, deposited it upon a couch in one of the chambers. The crowd had remained on the porch of the tavern, but the young man who had hastened to the rescue, followed. He had already dispatched a boy for Dr. Vandyke, with orders that he should lose no time. The tall serving-man, meanwhile, busied himself in bathing the wounded forehead in cold water. The youth looked on during this ceremony with an expression of much concern. “What is the name of your master?” he said, at length, to the old servant. That personage replied in a brief, cold voice, without raising his head— “My Lord Ruthven.” “Of his Excellency's suite?” “Yes.” As the abrupt monosyllable was uttered, Lord Ruthven opened his eyes. As they fell upon the young man, he started violently. “You here!” he gasped, with an appalled look. “Good Heavens!—you?” He sank back, closing his eyes, and shuddering. The old serving-man rose erect, and his whole body seemed to stiffen—his eyes expressed a vague astonishment, mingled with sternness. He had opened his lips to speak, when another personage made his appearance—Dr. Vandyke. “Well,” said Dr. Vandyke, approaching the couch, and striking the floor with his stick at each step, “where is the hurt?” He stopped suddenly. “Humph!—Lord Ruthven!” he said. “An excellent horseman. How was he thrown?” “I was the unfortunate cause of the accident, doctor,” said the young man. Dr. Vandyke wheeled round and gazed at the speaker. “You are Edmund Innis?” he said. “Then you know me?” “Yes, I know you.” “So much the better, doctor—then you will understand how much I regret this unfortunate occurrence.” In a few words he described the origin of the accident. Dr. Vandyke, who was now engaged in laving and bandaging the wound, replied only in grunts. In a few moments, the patient uttered a deep sigh, and again opened his eyes. Again he gave a violent start, and exclaimed: “You!—then I did not dream!—oh, no, no!” The words were almost a cry. The wounded man shook as he uttered them. Both the youth and Dr. Vandyke listened with the utmost astonishment. Then the physician looked keenly at the youth. “Your presence appears to agitate Lord Ruthven,” he said. “Agitate him? my presence? I cannot conceive the reason!” exclaimed the youth in utter bewilderment. “He evidently recognizes you!” growled Dr. Vandyke. “Recognizes me? I have never before seen him even!” “That is strange,” was the reply, and Dr. Vandyke directed another keen glance at the speaker. “It is true.” “Doubtless—but listen, he is going to speak!” “That face!” murmured Lord Ruthven, without opening his eyes, “that form! — again! — and here, when I thought I had fled from him forever?” “Listen!” said Dr. Vandyke, with a species of grunt. “The ocean is no barrier, then!” muttered Lord Ruthven. “Fate plays with me!” The young man gazed with great astonishment on the wounded nobleman, and then at the physician. “This is the strangest of mysteries to me, doctor,” he said. “What Lord Ruthven can mean by thus speaking of me—as though we had met elsewhere— had relations with each other—I know not. I am in utter darkness as to the meaning of the whole affair. But one thing is plain—that my presence agitates him, as you say. I will therefore go, and return later, to ascertain his condition. I had proposed leaving Williamsburg this very day; but I shall now defer my departure. Before going I must know that he is out of danger, as I was the unhappy occasion of his very painful accident.” “Right,” said Dr. Vandyke; “go, and come back to-morrow. The hurt is serious—not mortal at all.” The youth bowed, looked with sympathy upon the pale face of the sick man, and left the room. As the door closed, Lord Ruthven opened his eyes, and looked around him, evidently seeking for some one. A deep sigh followed. “Where is he?” he said, in a low, trembling voice. “The young gentleman?” said Dr. Vandyke. “Yes—yes!” “He is gone.” “His name?” “Mr. Edmund Innis.” “I never heard the name before!” And, as he spoke, Lord Ruthven fell back, uttering a sigh, and closing his eyes. “Humph!” grunted Dr. Vandyke; “the mystery is growing more mysterious than ever. Well!” The words attracted the attention apparently of the sick man, who looked at the speaker. “You are—a physician, I think, sir?” he said. “Yes—sent for, to come to see you.” “Your name, doctor?” “Vandyke.” The patient inclined his head faintly. “You are known to me, doctor, by repute at least. I am fortunate. Tell me how I was hurt. My horse threw me, I think?” “Yes.” A few words described the accident. “That was careless in me—very careless,” he said; “and this young gentleman—will he return?” “To-morrow, he informs me.” Lord Ruthven made no reply for some moments. His face had grown whither than ever. “If I could only—leave this place to-night!” he murmured. He looked at the physician, and said: “My hurt is a mere trifle, I presume, doctor?” “Every thing in life is a trifle, and every thing important,” was the reply. “You may be ill for a month, or well in a week.” “Thanks, doctor, and now I think a little sleep will prove beneficial to me. May I beg that you will call and see me again to-morrow?—Wait upon the doctor, Fergus—and give orders that I shall not be disturbed. Then return.” It was plain that Lord Ruthven wished to be alone, and Dr. Vandyke took his departure, escorted ceremoniously by the body-servant Fergus. In five minutes Fergus reëntered the chamber, closing and locking the door behind him. His master's face was even paler, if that were possible, than before. His eyes burned in their deep sockets. “Fergus,” he said in a low, awe-struck whisper, “I have seen him!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">III. THE BODY-SERVANT. Fergus greeted this abrupt exclamation with an air of perfect coolness. “The young man, my lord?” he said. “Yes!” “When?” was the laconic question of the old body-servant. “When I saw the other!” “The young woman, my lord?” “Yes!” This brief dialogue was followed by a long silence, interrupted once or twice by a stifled groan from Lord Ruthven. Fergus knit his brows, but preserved his coolness. “Well, my lord,” he said, at length, “I say again what I have said time after time in Scotland, England, France, and elsewhere, that the future must take care of itself.” Lord Ruthven frowned. “Meanwhile,” continued the body-servant, coolly, “I would advise your lordship to keep a stout heart, and hope for the best.” Whereat his master broke out: “A stout heart!—then I am a baby!” Fergus saw the storm coming, but did not shrink in the least. “You mean that I am a mere nervous invalid!” continued Ruthven, angrily— “a cowering slave, shrinking from shadows!” Fergus retained his calmness, and replied: “I beg to call your lordship's attention to the fact that, if you grow excited, your wound will bleed afresh.” “I care naught for it—let it bleed!” “The blood is even now oozing through the bandage, my lord.” Lord Ruthven replied by violently tearing the linen from his head. Immediately a stream of blood ran down his white cheeks, rendering his appearance ghastly. The spectacle disarmed in an instant the stiff old Scotchman of his coolness. The upright bar of iron suddenly melted. Fergus ran to his master, and placed his arm around him. “My lord! my lord! you will kill yourself!—you will bleed to death!” he cried. “What care I, Fergus?” “My lord! my lord!” “What care I whether my wretched life ends here, and now or not?” The old man uttered a groan, and busied himself in washing away the blood. He then replaced the bandage with the tenderness of a mother, and Lord Ruthven, who had sunk back and closed his eyes, made no resistance. “Your lordship cuts your poor old Fergus to the very heart,” said the servant. “I would not do so, Fergus,” was the nobleman's low reply, “but you know well the terrible effect upon me of the least expression of doubt upon that subject. I am to `hope for the best!' Then I am not competent to direct the event. You mean that, though you do not say it—!” “Your lordship grows excited.” “You intimate that I may fail in the hour of trial!” “My lord!” “That I may be induced to yield to this accursed temptation!” “My lord, I think nothing, and say nothing.” “Do you dream that I could?” said Lord Ruthven, in a despairing tone, and with gloomy sarcasm he added: “You, no doubt, imagine that the part of the drama in which you appear is to be enacted also in Virginia.” Fergus replied with great coolness: “I think, my lord, that this world we live in is a very strange world, and that we can't tell what will happen a day in advance.” “True, true!” murmured Lord Ruthven, in a hopeless voice. “And as to myself, my lord—do you think I am afraid? Has your lordship the right to think that, when I have remained with you—looking death in the face?” The nobleman suddenly raised his head, and held out his hand to the old man. “Pardon me, Fergus!” he said, “pardon my injustice and ingratitude! You are truly brave and faithful!” Fergus bent down and kissed the hand extended toward him, with an expression of the deepest respect and affection. His face flushed, and a moisture came to the old eyes. “There is naught to pardon, my lord. Am I not your servitor? Do with me as you will.” From under the bushy eyebrows darted a glance of absolute tenderness— that of the feudal vassal for his beloved lord. “No!” Lord Ruthven said; “we are not master and servitor, Fergus. You are my foster-brother—more than that, you are my friend. We must not quarrel. We are in a strange land together. We must be fast and true—fast and true!” Fergus had retired a step, and now bowed respectfully. “I never doubted your devotion, Fergus; that you remain with me is sufficient proof of that; nor did I ever dream that my brave Fergus was afraid.” The old Scotchman, who had grown as cold as ever, shook his head. “As to the devotion, my lord, you do me no more than justice. I am devoted to you; but, as to the fear, there you are wrong, I am afraid.” “You have cause to be,” groaned Lord Ruthven. “But I dare the danger, and don't let it frighten me, my lord. I have my duty to do to the last of the great line of Ruthven; and that duty I will perform, though the devil himself rise in my path!” “My faithful Fergus!” “Thanks, my lord, for the word. I hope I'm faithful. And, now as your lordship calls me foster-brother—tell me—I wish to know—will your lordship remain here in Virginia?” “I know not—no! no! How can I?” Fergus looked for some moments, intently, at his master. In this fixed glance there was no little astonishment. Then, slowly shaking his head, he said: “It needs must be that something terrible is going to happen when the last of the Ruthvens—the bravest, strongest of his race—talks thus! You shiver and turn white! My lord, let us go.” “Yes, yes!—and yet—his excellency will think it strange! But—well, well! leave me now. I will sleep, Fergus, and —to-morrow—” The voice died away, and the speaker, with his eyes fixed upon the floor, fell into a profound and gloomy reverie. Fergus turned away. As he did so, he uttered some words in Gaelic. These words signified—“It is fated!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">IV. KNOWN AND UNKNOWN. On the next evening Lord Ruthven, clad in a rich robe de chambre, was stretched upon the couch in his apartment at the Raleigh Tavern, when Fergus entered, and said in his habitual tone of formal respect: “Mr. Edmund Innis has called to inquire after your lordship's health.” “The young man?” said Lord Ruthven, his pale face suddenly filling with blood. “Yes, my lord.” “I will see him.” Fergus did not move. “You heard, Fergus—I will see this young gentleman,” added his master. “Your lordship is very pale.” “But I am better.” “And still very weak.” “The interview will do me no harm.” “Your lordship insists?” “Admit him.” Fergus bowed and went out—his steps were heard descending the stairs. As he disappeared, Lord Ruthven rose and went to a mirror. “I am indeed frightfully pale,” he murmured, surveying his ghastly cheeks, “and my appearance will probably shock my visitor. Still I must see him. It may be that yesterday, while weak from loss of blood, stunned, with my brain reeling, I fancied—simply fancied—but no! there can be no doubt! the face, the hair, the lips, the eyes—all are the same!” The brows of the speaker contracted, and he drew a long, painful breath. “No! let me not attempt to cheat myself with any doubt!” he muttered; “'tis the very man!—and I tempt the evil fate that is dogging me by even speaking to him—by the very fact of receiving him! No, I will not see him! I will— Fergus!” And he hastened toward the door. As he did so, steps were heard ascending the staircase without. The visitor was plainly coming up, conducted by Fergus. “Too late!” groaned Lord Ruthven, “the die is cast. I must receive him. I shudder, and yet advance toward him— would avoid him, and yet cannot resist the temptation to gaze at him—to listen to him—” The hand of Fergus was heard upon the knob, and his voice uttered the words: “This, as you know, sir, is his lordship's apartment.” And the door opened, Fergus standing ceremoniously aside, and ushering in the visitor. Lord Ruthven had resumed his place upon the couch, from which he now rose as his visitor entered. The two gentlemen exchanged courtly bows, and Lord Ruthven gazed intently at the other, taking in every detail of his face and figure. Edmund Innis was a young man of twenty-two or three, with brown hair, powdered, after the fashion of the period, and tied with a ribbon, eyes full of frankness, a handsome mouth, indicating sincerity, and a carriage of the person at once proud and courteous. His embroidered coat, long silken waistcoat, and ruffles, indicated the class to which he belonged—for, at that time costume marked the social position of its wearer; but these fine garments were quite shabby, and the general appearance of the youth seemed to prove that his exchequer was in a very dilapidated state indeed. His frill was irreproachably white, and upon his finger sparkled a diamond ring; but the seams of his coat were threadbare, there was a hole in one of his elbows, and the cocked-hat held in his hand had lost every particle of the lace which once adorned it. In spite, however, of these unmistakable marks of the “poor gentleman,” Lord Ruthven had no difficulty in perceiving at a glance that his visitor was, what was called at that time, a person of distinction. The head above the worn coat was carried with proud courtesy, and the discolored hat descended in a bow which was as graceful as that made by the nobleman. “I beg that you will be seated, sir,” said Lord Ruthven, pointing to an arm-chair. “Thanks, my lord,” was the youth's reply, as he took his seat, “I am truly glad to find your lordship so greatly improved since I last saw you.” “A mere trifle, Mr. Innis.” “I feared your case was much worse.” “I am nearly recovered already.” Innis bowed. “That relieves my mind of a load of self-reproach. I need scarce inform you that I deeply regret my unfortunate agency in this accident, and feel that your lordship has done me the simple justice to believe that I was entirely unaware of the danger to which I enforced you. Your sudden fall was a very great shock to me.” “I did not doubt that for a moment, sir.” “So you are not seriously injured?” “In twenty-four hours I shall be as well as ever.” “God be thanked!” said the young man, cordially; “and now, having relieved my mind of all anxiety as to your lordship's condition, I shall return to my home without anxiety.” During this exchange of commonplaces and expressions of politeness, Lord Ruthven had continued to gaze intently at Innis, and, as trait after trait in the voice and countenance of the youth came out more plainly, this fixed gaze became one of much agitation. It was plain that Lord Ruthven was strongly moved. His dark eyes were riveted to the visitor's face, a slight color tinged his pale cheeks, his voice trembled perceptibly, and his breast labored in breathing. It was impossible that this agitation, if it were prolonged, should not attract the attention of the visitor. Lord Ruthven seemed to feel this. He made a powerful effort to suppress his emotion, in which he partially succeeded, and now said, in a voice which had grown calm and ceremonious again: “You speak of returning to your home, sir—then you do not reside in Williamsburg?” “No, my lord.” “Your residence is—?” “In the mountains.” “The Blue Ridge?” “Yes, my lord. From the door of my little home you may look upon a ring wellnigh of blue mountains, like waves on the horizon.” “That must be indeed a most picturesque prospect, sir. The Blue Ridge, I have indeed heard, is very beautiful.” “Admirably beautiful and imposing.” “As the Alps and Apennines, do you think, sir?” “Oh, doubtless not; but I have never seen either, and can form no opinion.” “Then, you have never visited Europe, Mr. Innis?” “Never, my lord. I am a mere Buckskin, as the phrase is in our country, and scarce travelled beyond my poor parish in the mountains.” Lord Ruthven drew a long breath, and continued to gaze intently at the youth. “I thought — I had — seen you before,” he said, in a low tone, and with an agitation which he could not master. “I fancied so,” Innis replied, looking with some astonishment at the speaker. “You fancied so?” “Yes, my lord.” “Pray, why?” “From some singular exclamations which you uttered yesterday.” “Some exclamations!” “When you had not fully recovered from the stunning effect of your fall.” “Oh, yes!” returned Lord Ruthven, with a sickly smile, “so that I uttered, you say—some—singular exclamations?” “Singular only as appearing to indicate upon your part an impression that you had met with me in Europe, and were surprised to find me in Virginia.” “Oh, I said that? How very absurd these fancies of fever!” “I am assured that fever invariably produces these effects.” “And you attached no importance, I presume, to these wanderings, sir?” “None whatever.” “They are truly absurd, and at times, I fancy, rather laughable. Did I say more in my delirium?—I am naturally curious to hear of my vagaries.” The sickly smile was repeated, as Lord Ruthven uttered these words with assumed carelessness; but his intent and burning eyes, fixed on the face of his visitor, betrayed the deep importance which he attached to the reply. Again Innis could not avoid observing that singular agitation. He hesitated, feeling a vague astonishment and uneasiness. Whither was the singular colloquy drifting? What was the object of Lord Ruthven in these questions, and why was he so deeply agitated? “You are silent, sir!” said Lord Ruthven, with feverish emotion; “I wish to know—” His voice had grown brief and imperious; but he suddenly stopped. “Pardon my rudeness, Mr. Innis,” he said, sorrowfully; “my nerves indeed must have been shaken, that I address a gentleman of your quality with so little ceremony. I beg you will overlook my rudeness.” Innis smiled. “I am far from thinking any apology necessary, my lord; nor was there aught in your tone even at which I could justly take offence.” “Thanks for your courtesy, sir; and now may I beg to repeat my question in milder terms?” “Your question?” “Whether I said aught more in my delirium yesterday than that I thought I had met with you in Europe, and did not expect to see you here?” “Frankly, you did say more.” “What more, may I ask?” said Lord Ruthven, turning a shade paler. Innis still hesitated. He remembered distinctly the words uttered by the nobleman on the preceding day: “That face, that form again!—and here!—when I thought I had fled from him forever!” He looked at Lord Ruthven and was silent a moment; then he said: “Your lordship attaches undue importance to these exclamations of fever —yours did not differ, probably, from those uttered by others at such moments. I am happy to find that this confusion of mind has now wholly disappeared—and that—” “Pardon the interruption, Mr. Innis!” said Lord Ruthven, feverishly, “but you have not replied to the question I had the honor to address to you.” “You would have me—?” “Essay to recall, if it please you, sir, the exact words which I uttered. I beg that you will reply frankly.” “I will do so, my lord. I do recall your expressions.” “What were they, sir?” “Your lordship compels me to remember and repeat words which I had almost forgotten. As you plainly wish to have them repeated, I reply that upon opening your eyes, and seeing me standing before you, you addressed me as a person from whom you thought you had fled forever!” “Fled forever! I said that?” “Such were your words, and I pray you to observe that they are only repeated at your urgent request. They will, of course, be buried in my bosom, as having no importance or significance.” “I beseech you to thus bury them!” exclaimed Lord Ruthven, with irrepressible agitation, “and that from this moment, if possible, you will even cease to remember them.” “You can rely upon my word with implicit faith,” said the youth, proudly. “I feel that I can do so, Mr. Innis. Human beings with eyes and lips like your own never deceive, sir!” Innis inclined his head. “Thanks for your courtesy, my lord.” “Do not even remember if that is possible, those foolish words, Mr. Innis! My life has been strange and unfortunate, my words and actions are wild, inexplicable, and yet could be explained! I said yesterday—but why recall that?— there is a woful mystery, to be frank with you, sir, under what I uttered. I speak to a man of honor—your face says `Trust me!' and would to God that I could speak! I cannot. I have even now said far more than in cooler moments I should have done. We shall see each other, after this day, no more, I hope—suppose I should say, sir!” Lord Ruthven wiped his forehead, upon which had burst forth an icy perspiration. By an immense effort, he suppressed his emotion. “This seems strange to you, doubtless, sir, and you will think that my fever has not left me,” he added, more calmly. “I shall, therefore, cease to allude further to this somewhat strange subject, only repeating my request that you will forget all these absurdities—the ravings of my delirium, and the words just uttered in confidence by one gentleman to another.” “I shall carefully observe your request, my lord. Your fever and your confidence are both sacred to me.” “Thanks, sir,” said Lord Ruthven. “I could not feel more perfectly assured of that than I now do, in consequence of your promise.” His head drooped, and an expression of weariness and sorrow came to his face. Then, raising his eyes slowly, he said: “Do you know what thought passed through my mind at that instant, Mr. Innis? I thought how glad I should be could I solicit your friendship.” “My lord—” “But I cannot—I should be proud and glad to do so—but—but—I shall in two or three weeks return to Europe, and it is wholly improbable that we shall ever meet again in this world.” Innis listened with astonishment, and could find no explanation for the tones and glances of Lord Ruthven. His voice had grown mild, cordial, and full of kindness. The glance fixed upon the young man's face was almost one of affection. “You do me great honor,” said the youth, much moved, “and can you not remain? Do so, if possible. I, too, should be proud to secure your lordship's regard and friendship.” “You!” “Assuredly.” “Oh, no! 'Tis impossible! And yet—no! Pardon me—I mean only that I must return.” “You should remain with us longer. Virginia is the land of lands!” “'Tis doubtless beautiful, sir, but my voyage is unavoidable.” “You cannot defer it?” “I regret that it is out of my power to do so, sir.” Innis rose. “Well, at least, my lord,” he said, “your hurt is healing, and I shall not have the great grief of reflecting that your death lay at my door.” He smiled, but Lord Ruthven's face had no smile upon it as he replied: “Certainly no blame could—or can— attach to you, sir.” “And Virginia is spared the sadness, too, since you will not die on our soil.” “I know not, sir,” said Lord Ruthven, with a singular and gloomy look. Innis laughed. “Let us hope for the best,” he said. “I shall now bid your lordship good-even.” “Can you not sit longer, sir?” “No, with thanks. I must set out for the mountains at dawn, and I shall now have the honor of taking a final leave of your lordship.” As he spoke, Innis cordially extended his hand, his handsome face lit up by a friendly smile. Lord Ruthven made no movement to accept the proffered hand. His eyes had suddenly closed, as if he were about to faint, and his face had grown ghastly pale. “Your lordship is ill!” exclaimed Innis, hastening toward him. “No, no!” returned Lord Ruthven, in a low voice, and repulsing the youth with a motion of his hand. “That is to say—a slight dizziness—a species of vertigo, doubtless—but 'tis passed.” He rose, and, without making any motion to offer his hand to his visitor, made a low and courtly bow. “Farewell, sir,” he said; “I owe you many thanks for this obliging visit. Should we not meet again, I shall retain in my memory the recollection of a most agreeable interview, Mr. Innis.” A second bow followed the words. Innis, without offering his hand a second time, replied by a similar inclination, and, putting on his hat, went out of the apartment. As the door closed, Lord Ruthven tottered rather than walked to the couch, and fell upon it, as though his strength were completely exhausted. “No, no, no!” he groaned, “I could not take his hand! I could not be guilty of that infamy at least! Whatever devil drives me—whatever I do—I will not be false—no! never! If he falls by my sword 'twill not be the friend whose hand I've clasped.—Knowing—” There the voice of the speaker died away in a species of gasp. “Cursed! cursed! cursed!” There words escaped in a stifled whisper from Lord Ruthven's lips, and he fell back, closing his eyes. When, ten minutes afterward, Fergus entered the apartment, he found that his master had fainted.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">V. IN THE DARKNESS. Since the scenes just described, three days had passed. Night had come, and a violent storm was lashing the capital. The wind rolled with the hoarse moan of the sea in a tempest, above the crouching houses; from moment to moment the black clouds cracked from horizon to zenith, letting out the lightning; and these dazzling flashes were followed by bursts of thunder, which seemed to utter aloud the fury of inanimate Nature. In spite of the storm and the heavy drops preluding the coming rain, Lord Ruthven, who had risen from his sick-couch on that evening, took his way toward the governor's palace to call upon his excellency. He wore a suit of black velvet, and the small short-sword, then a portion of full-dress costume. The lightning, from instant to instant, revealed his funereal figure and pallid face. From the gloomy expression of eye and lip it was plain that the agitating scenes of the day of his accident had profoundly impressed him. “Well,” he muttered, “I will sound his excellency to-night upon the subject of my departure—that is the best course. He has left williamsburg—for the moment, the danger is past — but who knows? He may come back; fate is powerful; and then—then—yes, I will go! That is best!” He went on, paying no attention to the storm. “Let me not palter with my destiny,” he added, his voice low and mournful, his lips assuming a melancholy smile. 2 “This accident is a presage—reciprocity is the law of Nature—his act on this very street struck me down—mine will strike him!” A dazzling flash of lightning followed the words, and the roar of thunder succeeded. A slight color had come to the pale face. “I believe I enjoy this hurly-burly of Nature,” muttered Lord Ruthven; “'tis in unison with my stormy life. Yes; the more I reflect, the more clearly I perceive 'tis best to go. And yet—am I panic-stricken, timid, nervous? He is no longer here. He has gone to his home in the mountains—” The speaker struck suddenly against some object approaching him. It was a man whose footsteps had been drowned by the uproar of the wind, and whose form had been concealed by the black darkness of the night. Lord Ruthven drew his dress-sword—for it appeared to him that something hostile was intended by this unknown—and, retreating a step, directed the point of the sword toward the shadowy figure. At the same instant a flash of lightning cut the air like a white-hot blade, and Ruthven recognized Innis. “You!” he cried. “Yes, I, my lord!” returned the young man, with some sternness in his voice. “What means this threat—this sword's point at my breast?” Lord Ruthven shuddered from head to foot, and dropped the point of his dress-sword, which he violently thrust back into its scabbard. “You, sir!” he repeated. “Good Heavens! who could have dreamed of this encounter? I thought you absent— my sword's point — 'twas unwittingly that I drew my weapon—pardon me, sir —the night is dark, and—you have not then left Williamsburg?” The agitation of the speaker was so great that Innis understood instantly that nothing hostile had been intended. “No, my lord,” he said; “and we encounter each other again under singular circumstances.” “Fatal circumstances!” Innis uttered a light-hearted laugh in the darkness. “Not so very fatal, my lord, since no one is hurt. Your sword at my breast caused me some astonishment, and a little irritation, it may be. But a word explains all. You no doubt took me for a footpad, and in the dark 'tis well to be on one's guard.” “Yes—and in the light,” was the reply of Ruthven, in a singular tone. “You were going—?” “To see his excellency. And you, sir?” “To the house of a gentleman living near the capitol.” “You designed leaving Williamsburg, I think, when we parted, sir?” “I did so design, my lord, but the fates forbade.” “The fates?” “Or chance, or Providence, as there is no chance, I think, in life.” “You are right, sir. If you will not think me singular or intrusive, may I ask what you call `the fates,' or `Providence?”' Lord Ruthven heard the smile, so to say, of Innis, as he replied in the darkness: “Oh, my lord, the explanation is extremely simple. I came to Williamsburg, designing to make arrangements with my father's friend, Mr. Wythe, to become a law-student in his office—when about to leave the capital he begged me to stay and copy for him some important papers.” Lord Ruthven remained silent. “There is all the mystery,” said Innis. “And—this work, sir—doubtless, 'tis onerous?” “Somewhat.” “'Twill detain you longer?” “I fear so.” “When you are anxious to return?” “I confess, I shall be pleased to do so.” Lord Ruthven reflected for a few moments, and then said, in a melancholy tone: “I envy you, Mr. Innis, this return to your family. The hearthstone will brighten for you; with me 'tis different. I have no family and no home—a residence only.” “I am no less unfortunate, my lord. My parents are dead, and I have no brothers or sisters.” “But relatives, friends — perchance, one nearer and dearer than any friend—” The expression of the speaker's voice was singular. The words were careless, but he listened anxiously, it was plain, for Innis's reply. “Nearer — and — dearer?” said the youth, in a confused voice. “I mean that you are expected by some dear one yonder, Mr. Innis—some young lady—who loves you—” “Oh, no, my lord! I'm not so fortunate.” “There is none such?” “None.” Lord Ruthven drew a long breath. “Heaven be thanked!” he muttered. “Your lordship said—?” “Nothing, Mr. Innis.” A sudden flash revealed Lord Ruthven's face. He was sunk in profound thought—his eyes half closed. But this preoccupation rapidly disappeared. “I am detaining you, Mr. Innis,” he said. “This interview, as you have said, is singular. Commencing with my sword-point directed at your breast” — the speaker shuddered as he uttered these words—“and ending with a somewhat ill-bred intrusion upon your private affairs.” “Oh, not at all, I beg you to believe,” said Innis; “'twas perfectly natural.” “There was certainly no intent to offend you with sword or tongue, Mr. Innis; and now I bid you good-even. The storm is about to burst. We shall not meet again, sir—I have resolved to return to Europe. Farewell, sir.” He passed Innis, as he spoke, walking rapidly, and not offering his hand. “The die is cast—I go, and go at once!” he muttered; “to stay were madness indeed!” The roar of the wind drowned the words. Unconsciously he turned his head. At the same moment a vivid flash lit up the street, revealing the form of Innis. The youth was standing motionless, looking after him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">VI. RUTHVEN'S RESOLUTION. Toward midnight Lord Ruthven returned from the governor's palace, through the drenched streets, and, going to his apartment in the Raleigh, aroused Fergus, who was stretched asleep upon a pallet in one corner of the chamber. “Fergus! Fergus!” he said, feverishly. “My lord,” was the cool response; and Fergus, wide awake in a moment, rose to his feet. “Pack my trunks, Fergus,” said Lord Ruthven, in the same agitated voice; “we are going.” “Yes, my lord.” And the old servant calmly began to collect the articles of his master's wardrobe, carefully fold them, and deposit them in two or three large travelling-trunks which stood in a sort of closet. “We are going,” repeated Lord Ruthven, walking up and down the apartment. “To Europe, my lord?” “Yes.” Fergus nodded. “I am glad to go,” he said, “and at once.” “I have seen him again!” “Him?” “Him.” Fergus made the same movement with his head. “Then he has not left this town?” “No.” “Your lordship met him?” “Yes—to-night.” “In the storm, my lord?” “Yes; and wellnigh began the struggle—my sword at his breast.” And Lord Ruthven described his nocturnal meeting with Innis. Fergus listened, busily packing the trunks meanwhile. “Well,” he said, when Ruthven had finished his narrative, “I think your lordship acts wisely. This is no place for you if he is here. I know not how it is, but I grow more frightened day by day. Your lordship is changing, and for the worse; let us go.” “Yes, yes! Mount your horse to-morrow, ride to the port on James River, and engage our passage to England.” “I will do so, my lord, at dawn.” And Fergus continued steadily to pack the travelling-trunks. Lord Ruthven walked up and down the apartment for some time in gloomy thought, then took his seat at a table, and wrote for an hour; then, laying down his pen, rested his forehead upon his arms, crossed on the table, and either reflected or slept. Fergus continued to pack the trunks.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">VII. FERGUS RIDES. With the first light of dawn Fergus was in the saddle, and riding in the direction of James River, where, at the nearest wharf, he expected to find some bark bound for England. He saw two vessels, and was soon making inquiries. “You are outward bound soon?” he said to the captain of one. “No,” was the reply; “just arrived from Portsmouth.” “And that other bark yonder?” “From the Bermudas — hugged me close all the way—came up the river together.” “There is no outward-bound ship?” “None.” Fergus rode back and reported the result to his master, who received the information in gloomy silence. “Bring the last number of the Gazette,” he said, at length. Fergus descended, procured the Virginia Gazette from the landlord, and returned. “This paper brought me ill-fortune but the other day,” Lord Ruthven muttered, with a painful smile; “perhaps 'twill bring good fortune to-day—let us see.” He opened the paper, and his eyes fell upon the lines: “Port of York.—The Charming Sally, Captain Fellowes, intends for England in six days from this date. Passage secured by applying to Captain Fellowes.” Lord Ruthven read this announcement to Fergus, and said: “This vessel sails to-morrow; I will go in her.” Fergus nodded, went to the stable, mounted, and took his way toward Yorktown, where he found Captain Fellowes standing on the wharf, and superintending the efforts of his crew to drag the Charming Sally on shore by means of cables. “What is the matter?” said Fergus. Captain Fellowes turned round, surveyed Fergus attentively, and said: “The matter is, my friend, that the Charming Sally has scraped a hole in her sheathing, and that the young lady is going to be laid up, neither more nor less than happens on certain other occasions with the interesting sex.” And Captain Fellowes winked, rolled the quid of tobacco in his ruddy cheek under his tongue, and uttered a jovial laugh. “Then the ship will not sail?” said Fergus, cool and unimpressed. “Can't, my friend,” said the captain. “She'd spring a leak in the very middle of the Atlantic, mayhap; then good-by to the Charming Sally.” “Is any other vessel in port outward bound?” “There is no other.” “And how long will it take to repair your vessel?” “Well, it may take three weeks, and it may take three months. To tell you the truth, my friend, I begin to think we have made our last voyage this year.” Fergus rode back to Williamsburg, and reported this second failure to Lord Ruthven. A bitter smile this time greeted the return of the old servant. “Fate seems to have assumed the direction of affairs,” said Lord Ruthven; “but I shall make one more effort. Rest to-day, Fergus; to-morrow ride to St. Mary's, on the Potomac. If you fail to engage a passage there, proceed northward, if necessary, to the port of New York. I have no choice; any species of vessel will content me, seaworthy or unseaworthy. This may end as it will.” And Lord Ruthven, leaning back in his chair, was silent. Fergus looked at him fixedly, shook his head, but made no reply, and quietly left the apartment. On the next morning he ordered his horse to be saddled, put a change of clothes in a small valise, and then, hat in hand, said to Lord Ruthven, who was gazing upon the floor in a fit of gloomy abstraction: “I am about to set out; has your lordship any further orders?” “None.” “I must engage passages for your lordship and myself, either at St. Mary's or at New York?” “Yes.” Fergus bowed, and went toward the door. As he did so, steps were heard ascending the stairs, and a knock came at the door. The old body-servant opened it. A man, wearing the livery of the governor, appeared, holding in his hand a letter. “For his lordship,” he said.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">VIII. THE TWO LETTERS. Ruthven mechanically opened the letter, glancing at it with little interest. As he read, however, his expression grew more gloomy. Having finished it, he placed it upon the table, muttering— “Impossible!” Fergus glanced at his master, hesitated, then returned a step, and said: “Will your lordship send a reply by the servant?” Ruthven raised his head. “No—yes—let him wait a few moments.” Fergus communicated this order to the governor's servant, who closed the door, and descended the stairs. “Fergus!” said Ruthven, without raising his eyes. “My lord!” “That same fate we were talking of has taken a new form.” “A new form, my lord?” “The form of his excellency the governor.” Fergus nodded; nothing ever seemed to astonish him. “Listen!” said his master, in a cold, careless voice. And, taking the letter from the table, he read: “My dear Lord: I have the honor to say that I have received your note of yesterday, informing me of your desire to return to Scotland, but I trust 'tis not essential to your plans, or required by circumstances, that this departure should be so very sudden. 'Twill subject me, I fear, to serious inconvenience, as I highly appreciate your services, my lord, and should with difficulty supply your place. “Your lordship will observe that I plead for a temporary change in your determination, both officially and as a personal friend. “Receive, my lord, —.” “You see,” said Lord Ruthven, stopping suddenly, and throwing down the letter. “Yes, my lord. And what will be your reply? My own movements will depend thereon.” “I shall not change my decision.” “Your lordship will go, all the same?” “Yes.” Fergus went toward the door. “Wait an instant and take my reply,” said Lord Ruthven. “These strange serving-men sink their eyes before me, but look pryingly at my poor pale face, Fergus, when my eyes are turned from them. I would be served by none but yourself.” And, drawing his chair to the table, Lord Ruthven took up a pen, and began to write. He had written but two or three lines, when steps again ascended the stairs without, and a second knock was heard at the door. Fergus went and opened it. A servant belonging to the tavern stood before him, a letter in his hand. “This was left for Lord Ruthven,” said the man. “By whom?” said Fergus. “By young Mr. Innis.” At that name Lord Ruthven quickly raised his head. “Mr. Innis!” he exclaimed. “Yes, my lord,” said the man. “When was this note brought—give it me!” The man was about to approach, but Fergus intercepted him. “No one waits on his lordship but myself,” he said. Placing the letter on the silver waiter, he handed it to Lord Ruthven, who took it hurriedly, and tore it open with visible agitation. The letter contained these lines: “For Lord Ruthven. “My Lord: You have twice, with great courtesy, expressed your good-wishes, in bidding me farewell—it is I who go from Williamsburg the first, now: and I can do no less than reciprocate your lordship's obliging sentiments, and express the hope that you may enjoy health and happiness, whether in Virginia or in Scotland. “Having terminated my business at the capital in a briefer space of time than I supposed I should do, I am just getting into the saddle to return to the mountains. Should your lordship ever find it suit your convenience, a visit to my little cottage there would greatly please Your lordship's “Very obedient servant, “Edmund Innis.” Lord Ruthven drew a long breath, and then turned to the servant who had brought the letter. “Who left this?” he said. “Mr. Innis himself, my lord. He was riding by with young Mr. Cary.” “On a journey?” “Yes, my lord.” Lord Ruthven looked at the letter— glanced then at the governor's—tore up what he had written, and said to Fergus in a low tone: “As there is no further danger, you need not ride to-day.” Fergus bowed. As he left the room, he muttered in Gaelic as before: “It is fated!” An hour afterward, his excellency the governor received a note from Lord Ruthven, saying that, in order not to subject his excellency to inconvenience, he would abandon for the present his intended voyage, which nevertheless might be rendered necessary at any moment. Having dispatched this reply, Lord Ruthven shut himself up, locked his door, and, drawing from a secret pocket in his breast a book, began to write in it. “Fatality—that is strong!” he said in a low tone, “but the will of a man— is that nothing? I have willed—naught shall move me!”</field>

      <field name="fulltext">IX. IN WHICH THE HISTORY PASSES TO THE MOUNTAINS. The current of the narrative bears us now from Williamsburg toward the mountains. It was there that the singular drama we essay to unfold before the reader was to find its stage, or at least to play its chief scenes; and, by accompanying him who is the main personage, we shall witness what occurred. The note for Lord Ruthven had been delivered at the door of the Raleigh by Edmund Innis, as he passed, on horseback, along Gloucester Street, directing his course toward the Blue Ridge. Beside him rode a young gentleman, with pale-blue eyes, chestnut curls, and laughing lips. Philip, or Phil Cary, as everybody called him, was about the age of Innis, that is to say, twenty-two or three, graceful, vigorous, and active in every movement, clad in a velvet hunting-suit, with innumerable pockets; and from his cocked hat floated a handsome feather. It would be impossible to imagine any thing more joyous, gallant, and redolent of youth, than his smile. Life brimmed for him, with gayety, enjoyment, and the charming zest which accompanies the first years of manhood—very plainly, the inexorable ennui which lies at the foundation of human life, as says Bossuet, had never touched him with its chilling finger. Jest, laughter, merriment, overflowed in him; you would have said that this young human being was glad that he was alive. Beside Innis, somewhat sad and thoughtful, Phil Cary resembled a sunbeam plunging through foliage into some shadowy nook; he sang, laughed, rallied his companion, looking on all sides with his roving glance, and turning all he saw into comedy. “Come, old fellow!” he exclaimed, “what's the matter? Laugh, I say!” “At what, Phil?” said Innis, smiling. “At every thing, or nothing. What's the use of sighing?” “I am not sighing.” “Well, you are thinking — that's equally bad.” “Don't you ever think?” “Never! I sing.” And Phil Cary burst forth into a song which made the forest, through which they were passing, echo again. “Very good!” he said when he had finished his song; “I know what you are thinking of.” “What?” “I mean what person.” “Tell me.” “Of Honoria.” “Pshaw!” said Innis, coloring; “why should I waste my time in—in— what you mean? And yet, Phil — I might retort and say that you were thinking of—her elder sister?” “Wrong! I never indulge in that folly.” “Then my fair cousin Lou and yourself have quarrelled.” “Not in the least. All the quarrelling is done by the old lady—my venerable mamma in the coach yonder.” “Look; she is calling you.” In fact, there was seen in front a large family chariot, drawn by four horses; and from the window waved a white handkerchief. Mr. Phil Cary obeyed this summons, and, putting spur to his horse, was soon beside the coach, which was occupied by an elderly lady in black silk. “Philip, my dear,” said the elderly lady, drawing down a large pair of glasses until they rested upon her nose, and gazing over them. “Well, mamma.” “Did you write in my name to Mrs. Byrd to say that we should stop at Westover?” “Yes, my respected mamma.” “In time?” “Full time; you see there are some young ladies there on a visit; and as I am in pursuit of a wife—” “Nonsense, Philip! why will you run on in that absurd manner?” “Absurd, my dear madam? I think 'tis the most intelligent thing I could do.” The scapegrace turned his head as he spoke and winked at Innis, who had ridden up. “Why think of marriage for a dozen years to come?” “Behold,” cried Mr. Phil Cary, “the most unreasonable of her sex! May I request to be informed of my age, my dear madam?” “You are twenty-three in November.” “And the age of my papa when he married my mamma?” “There, there, Philip — let us not speak so lightly—I was wrong perhaps, but you are my only stay now; you must remember that, my dear.” The young man became for a moment serious, and said: “My dear mother, there is no danger of my leaving you. A wife!—what do I want with a wife? Rest easy on that score.” After which assurance, he rode on with Innis, in advance of the coach, which, heavily laden with huge trunks went creaking on its way. I know nothing more delightful than a horseback journey through the variegated forest, in the brilliant, breezy autumn, when youth and health give a zest to existence, and the wind in the foliage whispers its mysterious secrets. Then the fresh breeze laughs—in riper age it sighs. To be young is the secret! —to ride then through the splendid, many-colored forest, the cream of earthly enjoyment. I should like to pause at “Westover,” where the travellers were received with warm hospitality. But these old interiors interest few persons to - day. “Westover,” the home once of Colonel William Byrd, the haunt of starry-eyed maidens, passes, as on a moving canvas, and our party continue their way. They halted again at “Belvidere,” on the site of the present city of Richmond, where they were lulled to sleep by the sweet murmur of the falls in the river—then they stopped at “Dungeonness”—the home of Mr. Randolph in Goochland— then a long day's journey brought them in sight of “Elmwood,” the mansion of Mrs. Cary. On the horizon were seen “Blenheim,” “Carysbrook,” and other ancient mansions; and, sparkling like a fallen star, with a last beam of the sun which fell upon its windows, “Rivanna” crowning its lofty hill and dominating the whole region. This enchanting land of field and forest, through which ran sparkling like threads of silver the Rivanna and its affluents, was bounded in the west by the deep-blue mountain, extending from north to south like a long surge of the ocean. Above it spread the purple flush of sunset; against this exquisite background every azure crest stood out in clear relief; and a flock of birds moving on slow wings amid the gray clouds, sunk down toward the fairy-land of sunset. Innis gazed from the portico of “Elmwood” at this beautiful scene—slowly turned his eyes toward the lofty hill crowned by “Rivanna” — and murmured with a happy smile: “I shall see her soon!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">X. HONORIA BRAND. Innis yielded to the importunities of Phil Cary, and spent the night at Elmwood; but at sunrise was again in the saddle, and on his way to “Rivanna,” where his friend promised soon to join him. The variegated foliage was fresh, dewy, and sonorous with the “caw caw” of the crows. That familiar sound struck on the ear of Innis with delight, and he went on at a gallop, full of joy, reaching finally the summit of a hill within half a mile of the old country-house. There he checked his horse, and looked for some moments with admiration on the prospect. To the left were circling hills, abrupt, heavily clothed with evergreens, and cut by the foaming current of a mountain-stream, above which towered mighty masses of rock full of wild and picturesque beauty. In front and to the right the ground trended off into charming slopes, dotted with oaks and ash-trees, and a rustic bridge was thrown across the stream below. On a commanding eminence beyond, standing proudly amid the great oaks of the extensive grounds, was “Rivanna,” with its white portico, broad wings, stacks of chimneys, and long rows of quarters, the whole lit up by the gold of sunrise. Innis stopped for a few moments only. Something beside the landscape evidently attracted him. He put spur to his horse, galloped down the hill, crossed the bridge, and passed through a tall gate, with ornamental capitals on the posts, into the grounds of the mansion. Suddenly he drew rein and uttered a joyous exclamation. Within twenty paces of him stood a young lady, leaning against the trunk of one of the great oaks, looking toward him, blushing a little, and smiling. Innis threw himself from the saddle rather than dismounted, and, hastening toward the young lady, exclaimed— “Honoria!” She came toward him with her fresh cheeks just tinted with roses, pushing back some brown curls from her forehead, and holding out a small hand. “I am very glad you have come back, Edmund,” she said, simply. “And I am happy for the first time since I left you, Honoria.” There was something ardent, earnest, and moving, in the voice of the speaker. His companion did not blush, but a quick light filled the great soft eyes, and an exquisite expression of happiness, at once trustful and timid, came to her lips. The sunrise fell upon her as she stood thus, and seemed to caress her. She was not more than eighteen, with a slender figure, which swayed naturally as she moved on her little feet, and a complexion all lilies and roses. What was better than the lilies and roses, the white neck bending like a swan's, and the whole physique of this gracious creature, was the modesty of her glance and smile—a certain winning sweetness—which said, “I am pure,” as the snow says, “I am white.” Her hand lay for a moment in that of Edmund Innis, and then was withdrawn, but without affectation or mock prudery. As they walked up the hill, Innis leading his horse by the bridle, the feelings of the youth were translated in his glances, which dwelt upon the fresh face beside him with an expression which left nothing in doubt. Eager, tender, their light veiled, as it were, by happiness, the eyes of the youth betrayed his secret. “When did you leave Williamburg?” “Three days ago.” “You came alone?” “With our friends of Elmwood.” “That must have made the journey pleasant.” “Very pleasant.” Does the reader wish to have recorded any more of this thrilling conversation? I spare him. Why should not youth and love play their parts unseen? Why repeat the commonplaces under which the heart beats? The words uttered are nothing—the aim of each is to hear the other's voice. So on this morning, full of sunshine, foliage, freshness, and charm, the young man and the girl walked beside each other, exchanging nothings, which were better than wit. A short walk beneath the great oaks, over a path gradually ascending, brought them in front of the long porches of the great mansion. Innis entered, Honoria ran to announce his arrival to her mother, and the young man went into the library. Before him sat, in a great arm-chair, Colonel Brand.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">XI. BIRTHS, DEATHS, AND MARRIAGES. Of “Rivanna” and its owner it is necessary to say a few words before proceeding further in this narrative. The house had been built by Colonel Seaton, a prominent gentleman of the colony, who, attracted by the beauty and fertility of the Piedmont country, had purchased a great estate here, sent to England for workmen and materials, and erected this fine mansion, at the then extremest limits of civilization. It is the hard fate of the rich to have some nail in the shoe. Colonel Seaton's nail was the want of children. The great house was dreary without them; and when one day he was informed that his brother and his sister had died, leaving each a little girl without a home, he went and brought the children to Rivanna, adopted them as his own, and, on the death of his wife some years afterward, gave his whole attention to the task of rearing them as joint heiresses of his estate. The elder of the two cousins was his favorite in spite of her high-spirited and somewhat restive character. But the moment came when this affection sustained a heavy blow. The young girl married Mr. Edmund Innis, an amiable and honorable but thriftless gentleman of the neighborhood; and Colonel Seaton, who had opposed the alliance in every manner possible, made his niece a low bow, and informed her that thenceforth they were to be strangers. The separation soon became more complete still. Colonel Seaton died. When his will was opened it was found that he had left the great estate of Rivanna to his younger niece, and to the eldest nothing. The younger was thus a great heiress, and suitors promptly appeared. None, however, pleased the young lady, and, weary of the wilderness, she went to spend the winter in Williamsburg. There her fate met her. Mr. Brand, of an ancient family and a great estate, paid his addresses. He was handsome, he was courtly, he had made the grand tour, he threw his money about in the grandest style; and, until his marriage with the young lady, which in due time took place, it was not discovered that the splendid suitor was bankrupt; his luxury and seeming affluence a hollow shell, covering — hopeless debt. His wealthy marriage, however, rescued him from ruin; his old associates lost sight of him; he had become a staid and imposing personage—the worshipful Colonel Brand, of Rivanna. Years passed, and two daughters were born to Colonel Brand; when this history opens they were approaching womanhood. Meanwhile, the elder cousin, Mrs. Innis, grandually saw poverty closing in upon her. Her husband was a gentleman of the highest character, but belonged to that class of persons with whom every thing fails. Some men have only to touch lead to turn it to gold. Mr. Innis had only to touch gold to turn it into lead. He had possessed a considerable property—as he advanced in life it dwindled. In ten years more, he would have been thrown homeless on the world, when, fortunately or unfortunately, he died, leaving his widow with an only son, and in possession of but a small remnant of the once ample estate of the Innises. What is it that a mother does when her husband dies, leaving her with one darling child only? She almost always spoils the child: and Mrs. Innis did all in her power to spoil Edmund. She did not succeed. There was something in the boy too proud, intelligent, and noble, to be warped; and, when his mother died, in his eighteenth year, clasping him with her last remains of strength to her poor heart, she left him simple, sweet-tempered, and unselfish. The hard hand of loneliness thus came to press upon the boy, as he touched the threshold of manhood. Immured in his little house, resembling rather a hunting-lodge than a dwelling, in a gash of the mountain, he saw far beneath him in the plain, “Rivanna,” “Carysbrook,” “Castlehill,” and the happy homes of happy families, while one or two old servants, who would not desert him, were the only human beings near him, and a few books were his only other company. Then a new resource suddenly presented itself. The cousins—his mother and Lady Brand, as the wife of the lordly colonel was colloquially called, in accordance with a usage not uncommon in colonial Virginia—had had no intercourse. This, it must be said, was the fault of Mrs. Innis, who, proud, sensitive, and high-spirited, would respond to no overtures, and resolutely declined intercourse with those who had spoken ill, she believed, of her husband. Death had come now to heal this breach. The sod had scarce closed over the poor lady, when Lady Brand came in her coach up the mountain-road—entered the little house —went up to Edmund, who was about to receive her with a bow, and, clasping her arms around him, kissed him, and said, with tears in her eyes: “My poor child, you must not stay here in your solitary home. You are my blood, and I love you very much, as I loved dear Anna. You must love me a little in return.” Thereat the boy melted, and sobbed in the good lady's arms. An hour afterward they were at “Rivanna,” and Edmund saw two young ladies of twelve and fourteen come toward him, offering their lips—in accordance with instructions—to their cousin. Thenceforth the life of Innis changed. A large part of his time was spent at Rivanna; and, in course of years, he found it wellnigh impossible to remain absent. The girl of twelve became the maiden of fifteen, then the young lady of eighteen; and Innis passionately loved her. Grave, calm, and serene in manner, the youth possessed strong impulses and ardent aspirations. Solitude grew distasteful, books wearied him—Honoria was ever before his eyes; and, mounting his thorough-bred, one of the few luxuries left him, he would go to Rivanna, spend whole days, and drink deeper and deeper draughts of that most intoxicating of beverages—first love! Nothing hitherto had come to mar his happiness. Lady Brand, whom he called “aunt,” received him always with the tenderest affection; Lou, the elder of the two girls, was his warm friend, and even the stiff colonel made him stately bows, and overwhelmed him with distinguished consideration—for the colonel was given to “deportment.” Of Honoria's feelings, the narrative will present a fuller view than is here possible. A few words more will convey a correct conception of Innis's situation and plans when our history commences. He was twenty-three — passionately in love with his cousin, the daughter of a gentleman of large wealth—poor, and doing nothing. At that thought the very soul of Innis revolted within him. He thought with bitterness of his probable future — of visiting Rivanna thus, year after year, in the character of a “poor relation” — of one day seeing Honoria give her hand to some glittering youth, forgetting him; and of growing old, uncared for, and forgotten in his lonely lodge, buried in its lugubrious pines. That thought had come day after day to cut Innis like a sharp blade to the very heart. His once ruddy cheek grew pale with bitter meditation. With the prejudice of race, at that time prevalent, he shrank from trade—he had no means to enter the professions — what was left him but to mope and dream, growing gray and sombre in his sombre dwelling—bending lower year by year beneath the inexorable weight which bows the strongest shoulders toward the tomb? These thoughts preyed upon him, as the worm preys on the bud, and his cheeks grew so pale that Lady Brand said one day: “You are pining, Edmund; what is the reason?” “I am twenty-three, and am doing nothing, aunt.” “Well, why remain idle?” “What can I do?” “Make yourself the first counsellor in the colony—you have the intellect.” Innis felt his pulse throb. Then his head sunk. “I cannot, aunt. I have no means to study.” Lady Brand smiled. “Listen, Edmund: my connection, Mr. Wythe, at Williamsburg, wishes a young gentleman in his office; he is growing old, and requires assistance in transcribing his law - papers. He will receive you into his house as one of the family gladly, in return for your services, and instruct you in law besides—” “Me, aunt?” “I say you, my child, because he offers to do so in this letter.” She looked at him with her kind eyes and smile, holding toward him the letter. “Why should I not scheme to set my boy up in the world, like other people?” Innis had his arms around her, ere she had finished, and kissed her. “Dear aunt!—you are very good to me!” “Don't thank me for only doing my duty, Edmund. And now, I think it best that you should go and see Mr. Wythe.” “I will set out to-morrow, aunt. Oh, I assure you, I am not disposed to delay.” “I will give you an early breakfast, then, my son; and may God guide you!” On the very next day Innis was, accordingly, on his way to Williamsburg, which he reached in due time. The venerable Mr. Wythe greeted him cordially. It was arranged that he should come to live in his office on the first of the ensuing January, and Innis returned, as the reader has seen. What befell him in Williamsburg has been recorded; what occurred on his return will now be related.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">XII. AT RIVANNA. Colonel Brand was seated in his large arm-chair of carved oak, with Spanish-leather covering—a tall and portly individual, ruddy of face from high living, with gray side-whiskers, and formal air, and clad in imposing costume. His face and bearing said: “I am the lord of the manor; you common people will be good enough to bow down to me!” He even held the number of the Virginia Gazette which he was reading with a stately air, as of a superior mortal, who performed an act of condescension in perusing what common people had written. Innis entered, and, approaching, bowed to the colonel, who rose slowly —for it was a part of his social philosophy never to omit any form of courtesy —and grandly held out two fingers. Innis took them; the colonel submitted to the ceremony without responding in any manner to the pressure bestowed upon the two digits; and then came, in stiff and formal tones: “You have just returned from the capital, I believe?” “Yes, sir,” replied Innis, taking the seat which the colonel indicated with a stately wave of the hand. “Hum!” The colonel cleared his throat in a formal manner, and resumed his seat. “Perhaps you bring some intelligence of interest,” he said, raising his chin, and slowly passing his jewelled hand beneath that portion of his person. “Scarcely any thing, sir,” replied Innis; “my stay, as you know, was brief.” Colonel Brand made an inclination with his head, as though to protest against being supposed to remember, or be aware of, a fact so very unimportant as the duration of the young man's absence. “His excellency is well, I trust?” “I believe so, sir.” “You saw him?” “I did not, sir, except when he was passing to his coach one day.” “I have the honor to enjoy his lordship's acquaintance. You saw none of the council or his excellency's suite?” “Yes, sir—I chanced to make the acquaintance of Lord Ruthven, his secretary.” “Lord Ruthven?” “Yes, sir; a nobleman from Scotland, I believe.” The colonel seemed suddenly interested. “A gentleman of—let me see—hum! from sixty-five to seventy?” “Scarce as old as forty, I think, sir.” “Then 'tis not my Lord Ruthven of Perthshire.” “You knew his lordship, sir?” “Well—indeed—hum!—I may speak of his lordship as my personal friend, and I possess and highly value a portrait of him which I have—his own gift.” “The Lord Ruthven of his excellency's suite may be the elder nobleman's son.” “True; what is his personal appearance?” “Very pale, with black hair and eyes, and of grave demeanor.” “The same; no doubt 'tis the son of the elder lord, who may have died recently.” Innis looked around for the portrait of the elder Lord Ruthven; it was nowhere to be seen. Colonel Brand seemed to have dismissed the subject. With imposing gravity he began: “The intelligence from England, I perceive, sir—hum!—” when, unfortunately for his stately discourse, the breakfast-bell rang; and, rising, the colonel approached the door, and, moving slightly aside, waved his hand for Innis to precede him. “After you, sir,” said the youth, courteously. “I beg you will proceed, sir,” said the colonel, with stately condescension. Innis smiled and obeyed. They entered the breakfast-room, and a tall, elderly lady, very graceful and attractive still, came from behind the urn, and, putting her arms around the youth, kissed him affectionately. Then Miss Lou Brand, tall like her mother, with dancing, hazel eyes, a superb complexion, dazzling teeth between rosy lips, and an air of gayety, mischief, and abandon, came and greeted him warmly. Honoria entered and took her place, and breakfast proceeded. “Where is Meta, aunt?” said Innis to Lady Brand. “I have no idea, Edmund; not making her toilet, for she is an earlier riser than any one in the household.” “I fancied I saw her at one of the windows as I came up the hill.” A species of inarticulate murmur was heard behind the youth; he turned quickly. On the threshold of the apartment stood a singular figure. The new-comer was a girl, apparently about fifteen, of very extraordinary beauty, but with something wild and elfish in her appearance. She wore a dress of the most brilliant and variegated colors, and superb dark hair fell in huge masses of curls upon both shoulders. Her eyes were dark, subtile, and penetrating, and were fixed intently upon Innis. He rose quickly, and went and held out his hand, with a smile, saying: “How do you do, Meta?” The girl coldly refused the hand, and, without uttering a sound, went to her place at the table. “Something has offended Meta,” said Lady Brand, in a low tone.—“Do not take any notice of her, Edmund; it is the best way.” The youth resumed his seat; breakfast went upon its way; the stately lord of the manor rose and returned to the library; and an hour afterward Innis was seated in his aunt's chamber, informing her of the fortunate results of his journey. He had made every arrangement to enter Mr. Wythe's office on the first of January. “Heaven be thanked that you have been so fortunate, my son!” said the worthy lady, busily knitting in her great chair; for, like a good Virginia housewife, she would never remain idle. “Now your career in life is open to you. By assiduous study you may become, not only prosperous but distinguished; and your old aunt will be as happy as yourself.” “Dear aunt,” said the youth, warmly, “how good you are to me! One would really suppose that I was somebody.” “You are of our blood, and that is very good blood, too, Edmund.” “But I am very poor.” “That is of all human things the least important to a young man—it is a spur to exertion.” “But, in case I were to—fall in love —aunt?” “Do not do so yet, Edmund. There is time enough for that, as my friend Mrs. Cary is always telling Phil.” Innis sighed. “I suppose you are right, aunt; but, in case I were to find my affections engaged—to love some one—then poverty would be a serious bar, I fear.” “Why should it, if you are energetic and make your way? Two sorts of wealth exist in this world, Edmund— property and intellect. If your intellect brings you revenue, is it not as valuable as landed estate, which can do no more?” “The land is much more certain, aunt; but we are wandering very far. You see I am quite fortunate now, and, thanks to you, have something to look forward to. Let me tell yo of my adventures.” And Innis related the incidents connected with Lord Ruthven, suppressing, however, as he had promised, all allusion to the singular words of the nobleman. “That was unfortunate, Edmund, but in this world we must not regret too strongly what we cannot help. You had no intention to injury Lord Ruthven, and, fortunately, he has recovered. These accidents are sometimes truly unhappy. Meta, you know, owes her loss of reason to a similar fall.” “Is it possible, aunt?” “Did you not know it?” “Strangely enough, I did not.” “We rarely allude to it, and never in her presence, as it agitates her frightfully. Meta, you know, is the only daughter of a cousin of my uncle, Colonel Seaton. Her father and mother are both dead, and we have only done our duty in taking the poor orphan to our arms. She came to us in her present condition— dumb and bereft of sense. When about ten years of age, she one day mounted a spirited young horse; the animal ran away and threw her to the ground, and in falling her head struck a sharp stone, which, it is supposed, drove a portion of bone in upon her brain. When she recovered from her fall the poor child had lost her reason. Truly, the ways of Providence are past finding out. And now don't let me detain you, Edmund. Old people must not monopolize young people; and yonder comes Philip Cary, a great rattle-trap, but a young man for whom I have much regard. Come back during the evening—I like to see as much of my boy as I can. You know we must soon part.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">XIII. THE PORTRAIT. Replying to this speech of the good lady by an affectionate glance, Innis rose, left the chamber, and went toward the staircase leading to the lower floor. As he did so, he perceived that the door of a small apartment, the private dressing-room of Colonel Brand, which few persons ever entered, was half open. Glancing idly through the opening, he found his attention suddenly arrested by a portrait on the opposite wall. This portrait was the most perfect, the most astonishing likeness of the Lord Ruthven of Williamsburg: the pale face, with its black hair and eyes, seemed starting from the canvas, and about to speak to him. Innis advanced a step, and looked long and intently at the picture. “The very face!” he said. And, returning to Lady Brand's chamber, he said: “Aunt, whose portrait hangs in the dressing-room?” “That with the white face and black locks, Edmund?” “Yes, aunt.” “'Tis the picture of Lord Ruthven, of Scotland, a former friend of Colonel Brand's.” “Strange that I never before saw it.” “And yet the explanation is simple, my son. The portrait originally hung in the hall down-stairs, but the face gave me a chill.” “A chill?” “It seemed to haunt me, with its deep, dark, melancholy eyes—its ghostly stare. So I begged Colonel Brand to remove it; he complied with my request, and it hangs now, you see, in his private apartment.” Innis nodded. “It has had a strange effect upon me too, aunt. The resemblance is striking to the Lord Ruthven I met with in Williamsburg.” “Ah, indeed?” “Yes aunt—the same haunting expression in the eyes of the portrait is reproduced in the eyes of the son.” “The son?” “Doubtless, my Williamsburg acquaintance is a son of the elder lord.” “Yes, yes — that explains the likeness. These resemblances of father and son are sometimes truly extraordinary. I remember, when young Mr. Harrison came to see us, I was so much astonished by his likeness to his father—” And Lady Brand plunged into a story, all about young Mr. Harrison, his father, who had once been a very intimate friend of hers, and other persons connected with them. We shall not inflict the good lady's reminiscences upon the reader. When the narrative was concluded, Innis rose, left the apartment, stopped again in front of Colonel Brand's dressing-room, to look at the portrait, and then went down the stairs, murmuring: “I could swear that this was my Lord Ruthven—or his ghost!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">XIV. META. Innis found his friend Phil Cary upon the portico, engaged in a word-combat with his intimate enemy, Miss Lou Brand, between whom and himself existed relations of permanent hostility— or very great liking—it was difficult to say which. They certainly struck fire, like steel and flint, whenever they met; but then they apparently could not remain away from each other; gravitated as it were together; and were much too aggressive and provoking to be indifferent. That excellent class of persons who take charge of the affairs of their neigh borhoods, said that Miss Lou Brand was extremely fond of Mr. Phil Cary, but had confidentially announced, in the secrecy of female friendship, that she intended to “give him a lesson.” Mr. Phil Cary, on the other hand, was said to be aware of this dire resolve on the part of his enemy, and to shape his course with great skill in accordance therewith —proceeding in his attentions just far enough to provoke and tantalize Miss Brand, but carefully refraining, with covert enjoyment of the joke, from an avowal. Such were the relations of the young people — circumstances would doubtless determine the result; meanwhile, they laughed at each other, held each other up to ridicule, and invariably sought out each other in society. Innis smiled as he passed them, and, inviting his friend to come and see him, mounted his horse. “Remember the party on Wednesday!” Miss Lou called out. “The party?” said Innis. “Haven't you heard of it? We expect to have half a dozen girls; they will stay for a week, and we intend to turn night into day!—it will be delightful!” “Turning night into day?” “Yes, sir! why not? Day is so stupid.” “And then the fairer portion of creation look so much better by lamplight,” said Mr. Cary, meekly. The young lady turned upon him instantly. “Why should not girls turn night into day, if they fancy?” “Why not?” echoed Mr. Phil Cary —“they do nothing.” “They sew, sir!—and that is better than passing the time in idleness, or eternally hunting, hunting, as is the practice of some people.” “Do you really sew?” said Mr. Cary, with interest. “Yes, sir; as your lordship is aware, we are the weaker species of vessels, and—” “Yes, yes, I had lost sight of that,” interrupted Mr. Phil Cary; “you therefore sew, and—am I wrong in supposing that you occasionally talk?” “Wearisome!” And, turning her back on Mr. Cary, Miss Brand returned Innis's bow, and said: “Be sure to come on Wednesday, and stay for a week at least, Edmund. We intend to have a charming time, and to eat the dumb-cake.” “What is that, cousin?” “A secret.” A smothered laugh behind the young lady excited her sudden indignation. “I don't believe there is any secret,” said Phil Cary, with much frankness; “women never keep secrets.” What followed this renewal of the assault, Innis did not observe; he left the foes in the midst of their altercation, and rode down the hill. As he went along slowly, his lips wore a faint smile, and his face was a little flushed. He was thinking of Honoria. In his absence, she had grown dearer far to him than before. Now, he would see her again for a few weeks — then he would leave her; time, change, vicissitude, would work their will on each. When should he see her again, if he ever saw her? The young man was going along, buried in these thoughts, his eyes fixed upon the ground, when suddenly his horse shied so violently that he was nearly unseated. The origin of this fright on the part of the animal was the occurrence of a very singular incident. From the great oak, beneath which he had been passing, had suddenly fallen, within five paces, the figure of the girl Meta. A sort of rustic bower in this great, wide-armed tree, was indeed a favorite haunt of the elf - like maiden; her singular agility enabled her to mount without difficulty to her hiding-place; and here, cradled in foliage, she would spend hour after hour, gazing at the sky, the passing clouds, listening to the twitter of the birds amid the leaves, or baring her brow to the cooling breeze. As Innis passed, she had swung from a drooping bough, falling as lightly as a cat to the turf beneath, and now stood looking at him with her singularly-piercing eyes framed in the masses of black curls descending to and nearly covering her shoulders. The expression of the beautiful face was strange. Anger, regret, tenderness —all passed in turn over the telltale countenance, which at certain moments reflected what was passing in Meta's breast so plainly that words were unnecessary. Words, indeed, the girl had none. Bereft alike of speech and reason, this poor girl was nearly cut off by her misfortune from all the life around her. She had succeeded, however, in making for herself a species of language of signs and gestures — Innis understood in a measure these signs — and, as the girl now began to gesticulate with singular energy, he understood that she was expressing regret for her cold reception of him upon his arrival. Innis looked at the young face, filled with its conflicting emotions, and an expression of pitying kindness came to his own. “It was nothing, Meta,” he said; “I was a little surprised, 'tis true. I am not hurt, however, and will not even ask you why you thus received me. I am sure of your affection for me, and you know my affection for you.” The head sank quickly, and tears came to the girl's eyes. She uttered some inarticulate sounds, blushed, trembled, then with a quick movement seized the young man's hand and kissed it. A few moments afterward she had disappeared, running with inconceivable 3 rapidity into the deepest shades of the park. Innis looked after her, shook his head with a pitying sigh, and rode on.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">XV. TWO PICTURES. A ride of a few miles brought Innis to his little hunting-lodge, perched on a knoll in a gash of the mountain, and overshadowed by haughty pines. An old man-servant, bowed down with age, came with a pleasant smile to greet him, and take his horse. Some kind words, indicative of affection on the part of each for the other, were exchanged; and Innis entered the little dwelling, where a bright fire burned upon the hearth, sat down, opened a book, and appeared to be reading. In a few moments the book sank on his knee, his eyes were fixed upon the fire, and his thoughts flew far away from his little mountain-lodge to the lowland and Honoria. He approached now a crisis in his life, when, perhaps, a few months would decide his future. Could he make something of himself, or was he doomed to vegetate thus forever in obscurity? No! He would not rust away thus, his fresh years fading to the yellow leaf—alone, unknown, a mere atom, and even of less importance than an atom in the universe. “No,” he said, finally, gazing around him at the small apartment, with its plain, almost rude appurtenances, which the firelight fell upon. “No, I cannot live here forever, with no one to love me, a mere nobody in the world. I will study, work, make something of myself. I may succeed as others have succeeded— rise in the profession of the law—three or four years hence I may go to the House of Burgesses—she will then be scarcely more than twenty—and—” With this “and” he stopped. A blush covered the youth's cheeks, and his head sank. Falling into reverie again, he fixed his eyes upon the fire, and remained silent. Was his imagination painting some brilliant future—the picture of himself, prominent, wealthy, honored, and married to Honoria? “In three or four years,” he murmured—“that is not so long—then—then —who knows?” The old, old story!—the tale that is told of all the generations of humanity! And at that very moment, Honoria, leaning her forehead on her hand, and looking out into the fine October night, was thinking of him. He was her young hero—the beloved of her fresh young heart. To Edmund Innis all her thoughts flowed, and her meditations were filled with bitter pleasure—a species of delicious pain. For Honoria, too, realized that the hour approached when her relations with Innis must undergo a change. What is it that one day suddenly tells the maiden of seventeen that the youth who has hitherto been to her but a cousin and favorite playmate, has become a lover? Then the old world of cousinship is dead, the new world of first love appears, all flowers, and sunshine, where the happy breezes whisper their exquisite secrets. It was plain to Honoria, as she sat sunk in reverie, with blushing cheeks, that Edmund was beginning to love her. His glance had revealed all, and she must take care how she treated him henceforth. She did not love him! Oh! no, no! —and the fact seemed very sorrowful, for Honoria uttered a piteous sigh. She loved him, of course, as her cousin, dearly—yes, very dearly—and why should she not? It was natural. He was so kind and generous and noble! So free from any thing mean or little. This was the origin of her liking. The fact that he was extremely handsome, the most graceful and elegant of all the gentlemen of her acquaintance—this had no weight with her, not the least! She loved him —yes! she did love him—as her cousin —for his goodness of heart; and she must be cold, indeed, not to do so—but —that was all! He was simply a favorite cousin, and—he was falling in love with her! What should she do? Permit him to deceive himself, perhaps, and grow unhappy? Oh, no! If she loved him as her friend and cousin, she should show it now by refraining from her former marks of affection, and discouraging him on the threshold. Yes, that was her bounden duty—she would resolutely perform it; and, having come to this resolution, Honoria sighed profoundly. All at once a quick blush rushed to her cheeks, and tears overflowed her eyes. “Edmund would never be so unjust,” she murmured. The quick thought had come to her that the young man might attribute her sudden coolness to the difference in point of wealth—to his poverty. His poverty! As if that could make any difference with her! She loved him a thousand times more for his poverty. The noblest men of history had been proud to be poor; and had found in high thoughts, the affections of the heart, and honorable toil, the noblest source of happiness. Edmund Innis might be poor in worldly goods, but he was rich in all else—in truth, honor, grace, sweetness, whatever best became a gentleman! His very worn and discolored coat became him better than the silks and velvets of others. His hat might be frayed and old, but when he bowed before a lady it was like a prince's coronet. And even his poverty was only a fancy. Why was not his small house as desirable as “Blenheim” or “Rivanna?” Why think that splendor and imposing luxury are desirable in this world? It was very pretty, this little lodge, perched on its knoll beneath the great pines. The proudest girl in all Virginia might be happy to live there—with Edmund! A quick, guilty blush came to the cheeks of the girl. Her reverie had led her to a point where suddenly she recoiled. “No, no!” she murmured; “I did not mean that! I was dreaming day-dreams—fancies—I am very foolish. Edmund is nothing to me; and my pride, perhaps, makes me think I am aught to him. I hope I am not—” A piteous sigh whispered through the words. “I am mistaken, I suppose; and even if—poor fellow! how could I bear it—his distress? But the young girls in Williamsburg are very beautiful, they say. If he loves me, I hope he will soon find one who will make him forget me. That would make me very, very happy!” And leaning her forehead on the window-sill, Honoria uttered a low sob. The old, old story! The tale that is told of all the generations of humanity!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">XVI. TWO HEARTS. From his lonely mountain - lodge, where no sound disturbed the silence but the low murmur of the great pines, Innis passed to the stately halls of “Rivanna,” where a party of youths and maidens filled the days and nights with uproar, revelry, and laughter. He was warmly welcomed by the young ladies and the gallants, assembled at the hospitable mansion — then he looked for Honoria. The young lady was not visible. The result of that sorrowful reverie, which we have partially described, had been that Honoria had resolved not to encourage the youth; that is, to receive him, if she received him at all, with something less than ordinary politeness; and, by way of inaugurating this auspicious programme, she did not leave her apartment, although she saw him plainly as he came up the hill. Innis acted with decision—or he was fortunate. Having spoken to his friends, he went straight to Lady Brand's chamber, and there he found Honoria. As he entered, the girl's face flushed, and her lip quivered. Then she suppressed these evidences of emotion; raised her head with stately politeness, and bowed to him with common courtesy—nothing more. This reception struck Innis like a blow. He became crimson, bowed low, and then stood in an attitude almost haughty before the girl, not uttering a word. Lady Brand looked at them in perfect bewilderment. “Why, what is the matter with you, Honoria; and with you, Edmund?” she exclaimed. “Nothing, mamma,” said Honoria, in a trembling voice. “Nothing, aunt,” repeated Innis. “But something is the matter,” continued Lady Brand. “I insist upon an explanation. These misunderstandings are perfectly absurd; why do not people go and have an explanation at once, when they fall out?—What is it, Honoria?” “Don't ask me, mamma!” exclaimed Honoria, suppressing with the utmost difficulty a burst of tears. “I have no explanation to make; no fault to find with anybody!” And, rising quickly, she hurried from the apartment. “What is the matter, Edmund?” asked Lady Brand, profoundly mystified. “I do not know, aunt,” said Innis, calmly; “you know that young ladies are subject to nervous fancies—Honoria will soon recover; I think I shall go down now, and pay my respects to the company.” He turned away as he spoke, descended to the drawing-room, and, retiring to a shaded recess, leaned upon the window-sill, and surrendered himself to bitter meditation. He was thus engaged when he heard a step at the door of the apartment, and the ear of the lover told him that it was Honoria's. A moment afterward, he heard her gay voice as she addressed the gentlemen; there was no agitation whatever in its tones: Innis had to deal with a woman perfect in all the lessons of her sex. He did not turn, until, as the party of youths and young ladies were going to stroll on the lawn, Phil Cary cried out: “Wake up there, old fellow, and come and walk!” Innis shook his head. “That will never do, Mr. Innis!” exclaimed an impulsive young lady, the “romp” of the party; “come this moment and walk with me, sir!” Refusal was no longer possible. With an internal opinion of the damsel which would by no means have flattered her amour-propre, he rose, offered his arm, and, a moment afterward, the “romp” had seized the arm of Honoria, dragging both Innis and the latter forth beneath the great oaks. Much injustice is done the class of young ladies called “romps;” what they lack in ceremony they make up often in warmth of heart. This one saw that Innis had no eyes for any one but Honoria; she brought them together; then she heard some one call her, or pretended to hear, and quietly retired, smiling sweetly upon the young man, who was thus left with Honoria. For some moments it seemed that this good fortune would have no results. Innis found himself walking beside a maiden who blushed a little, but exhibited no other indication of emotion; one who was determined to converse upon the subject of the weather, and explain nothing. For nearly an hour he tried vainly to direct the conversation to this topic— the alteration in the young lady's demeanor. She incessantly evaded the subject; foiled him at every turn; and preserved her self-possession. Innis stopped, raised his eyes from the ground upon which they had been fixed, and for a moment gazed with a long and searching look upon the girl. “So be it, Honoria,” he said, with sorrowful composure, and an accent both of grief and pride; “my pains, I see, are thrown away. You avoid uttering the few simple words I wish to hear. You are changed to me.” He could not suppress a species of groan. It was hard to feel hope leaving him. “I thought you had some—affection —for me, once. Had you not? But we will not speak of that. Do not reply. You had this affection, and are altered to me, refusing to explain why; or you had none, and do not feign. So be it, once more. You shall not be annoyed by my wretched importunity—by this love—yes, love!—which wellnigh unmans me. Oh, it is hard! very hard to— Your gay company shall not be made gloomy by my miserable face. I will go—in an hour I shall leave Rivanna —and forever!” She raised her head with a startled look, and gazed at him. Her cheeks were pale, and her eyes swam in sudden tears. “Oh, no, no!” she exclaimed, impulsively, “you must not go!” A guilty blush instantly drove away the pallor of her cheeks. “That is to say—I mean—” There the low voice died away, and a sob issued from the trembling lips. A moment had reversed every thing. It was Honoria who pleaded—Innis who was calm. His pride had come to his assistance. “You are cold to me, or angry with me,” he said, in a firm voice; “what course therefore remains for me, but to—” “No, no—not cold—not angry!” She placed her handkerchief to her eyes, and murmured: “But it is best that we should not—” The words ended in another sob. “Should not what?” exclaimed the youth, seizing her hand; “speak, Honoria! What mystery is this? You can trust me, can you not? You loved me a little, once—did you not—as your poor cousin, at least?” “Oh, yes, yes! Heaven is my witness —faithfully—and I act now from—affection for you!” The words were uttered in a broken and trembling voice. Honoria leaned against the trunk of the oak, beneath which they stood apart from the gay groups, and her whole frame was convulsed. Innis pressed the hand which he still held, with vehemence, and exclaimed: “Speak, Honoria! what means this? You act thus from affection?” “Oh, yes!” “That prompts you to treat me thus —coldly?” “Yes!” The youth was silent for a moment, lost in wonder; then his face grew suddenly pale, and an expression of intense bitterness came to his lips. He dropped the hand of the girl. “I now understand!” he said, raising his head with cold pride. “You understand?” “Yes,” he said; “yes, there is no longer any mystery to solve, Honoria. You are a woman—one of the best of them—but, after all, you are a woman.” He looked at her coldly and mournfully. “You have reflected upon the difference of our conditions,” he went on; “you have realized how broad a gulf separates the poor young man, obscure, and alone in the world, where he is nothing, from the beautiful young heiress whom all conspire to flatter—” “Edmund!” she exclaimed, wildly, “oh, you must not, shall not—” “Alas!” he said, with the same proud sorrow in voice and countenance, “it is true—too true! I can understand that good-breeding prompts you to deny the charge; it is possible, even, that you are unwilling to wound your poor cousin —your friend and playmate—who has loved you so long and faithfully!” “Edmund, Edmund!” she exclaimed, “this is ungenerous—cruel, terrible injustice!” He shook his head slowly. “I would not be cruel—alas! I cannot. It is the woful truth, which I have the courage to tell you, because I am about to leave you, and my heart is breaking! You have found at last, my poor darling—let me call you so, it is the first time and the last time—you have found that the present cannot be like the past, because the world has its claims upon you. You were Honoria once— now you find that you are Miss Brand of Rivanna, and must be governed by your station—and, what right have I to blame you? I am so wretched that I could not have the heart to inflict upon my worst enemy the agony I feel; but I have no anger now. I shall go back to my poor house yonder, and endeavor to forget you—try to remember you only to pray Heaven to bless you; but now, before we part, I will say what has been my feeling for months, for years. I love you, Honoria! I love you, neither as friend nor cousin, but with man's love for woman! I love you!—Oh! that does not express my thought! The very ground your feet pressed has been dear to me. Your glove, your handkerchief, the simplest object you have touched, has been precious to me. I have loved you!—loved you day and night—waking and in dreams—in my joy and my sorrow—you were my only solace! You took the place of father, mother, sister, and brother; I was a poor, lonely orphan, but your love was enough. You were my all—the light of my poor life, the pride and joy of a heart that centred all in you! I lived for you—I would have died for you! That is my last word—farewell!” He held out his hand, but suddenly the girl tottered; her head fell languidly toward one shoulder; and, had not Innis supported her, she would have fallen. Overcome by the long and passionate conflict, the poor heart taxed beyond its strength, Honoria had fainted. Innis looked around — no one was near, to render assistance. Within twenty paces, a little stream, gushing from a rock, ran between grassy banks. Innis bore the girl to the stream, and a handful of the cool water speedily revived her. As she opened her eyes, he withdrew his arm, but suddenly she clung to him. “Oh no, no! do not leave me!” she exclaimed. “Oh, do not go, Edmund! I too — have — loved you — loved you dearly!” And, as though the avowal had exhausted her strength, Honoria's head sank on his breast; she hid her blushing cheeks, and shook with a vague, delicious tremor in her true-love's arms. When she looked up at him, the young face was full of tears and blushes, but a smile shone there, like April sunshine. The wind laughed above them, in the mighty oak; the little stream ran gleefully between its grassy margins; the birds sang for them; the white clouds floated—they were young, they loved, and were triumphant over fate; for, whatever the hard hours bring, two hearts that love are the victors.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">XVII. MOTHER AND DAUGHTER. The two fond hearts thus beat together; each pressed to each—but, alas! it was more than probable that a stern hand, that of no less a personage than the resolute Colonel Brand, would thrust them asunder. Innis felt a chill invade his heart. What possibility could there be of gaining the colonel's consent to his union with Honoria? She was his favorite daughter, his darling and pride; she would inherit from him princely possessions; would he ever permit her to unite her fortunes to those of the poor youth, when she might command the homage of the proudest and wealthiest in the land? These questions came to the youthful heart, still trembling and agitated from the sudden weight of happiness, and Innis had an additional source of foreboding. Would not his course be attributed to the basest motives — nay, would not Colonel Brand meet him on the very threshold of Rivanna, with an insult—with the charge that he had dishonorably taken advantage of the freedom accorded him by the family, to win the affection of the young and beautiful heiress? The face of the youth blushed at the very idea of such an accusation. What would be the result? Insult— quarrel—bitterness beyond words; and, as he pondered thus, he looked at Honoria. There was no doubt in her face; naught but unshrinking, unhesitating love. Where the youth trembled, she, the “weaker vessel,” was firm; love had wrought this mystery. “My poor darling,” said Innis, looking at the girl with inexpressible pride and tenderness, “I fear this day is the beginning of much suffering for you, but I love you so dearly!” She inclined her head sidewise until it touched his shoulder. Then she looked up into his eyes, and said, smiling: “You ought to know that that is enough to console me for all, Edmund!” An hour afterward, Honoria had told her mother all. The good lady shook her head sadly. “My poor, poor child,” she said, drawing her daughter to her heart, “I feared this, and yet had not resolution enough to interfere between this affection on your part and Edmund's. He is all that the noblest woman could wish, and, were I able to control your fate, I should not hesitate; but I am powerless. You know your father's pride, and, I must add, worldliness. He has resolved, I fear, that you shall make a grand match; and Edmund is so poor— this terrible poverty!” “It is nothing, mamma!” said Honoria, with a blush and a smile. Her mother smiled in reply, but it was rather a sad smile. “It is every thing with Colonel Brand—or much, at least—but let us hope for the best. You say that Edmund would not permit you to bind yourself. That is like him, and time may change all. He may make his mark in the colony, and that may reconcile your father to the arrangement. I think, now, that Edmund had better absent himself for a short time.” “Yes, indeed, mamma; I have already given him his orders,” replied Honoria, laughing. Do not laugh at her laughter, reader. She was a mere child, and so happy. Innis left Rivanna on the same evening, and the place seemed dark to Honoria. For the first time, she felt how dearly, how absorbingly she loved him. Such had been the events of a single day in the life of Honoria Brand. She was happy beyond words; her young life was flooded all at once with sunshine; and the future seemed to contain no cloud which could overshadow her existence.</field>

The Virginians have been noted always for their devotion to the pleasures of social intercourse—their love of company, festivities, of whatever lifts from the heart the inexorable weight of care, or dissipates the wearying preoccupation of affairs. To enjoy while life lasts, and catch the perfume of the blossom—such is the philosophy of this race of English people living under brighter skies and warmer sunshine than the skies and sunshine of that “nest of swans,” as Shakespeare calls Old England. To laugh, to dance, to drive dull care away—such has always been the habit of the country society of Virginia; and at Rivanna, in the old times of which I write, the days and nights were one round of gayety. The flying hours were sent upon their way with joyous laughter—with music, games, rides to the mountain, and that most popular of all divertisements, love-making. All day the merry revel went on, and when night came the great mansion blazed with lights—the negro violinists tuned their instruments, the halls resounded, and the little beauties and their cavaliers bowed low in the stately minuet, or flew through the mazes of the Virginia reel, until the hands of the great shadowy-looking clock behind the hall-door pointed to midnight. The evening came at last preceding the day upon which it was determined that the party should break up. The company seemed to have grown weary of dancing, of games, of jest and laughter. As a new entertainment, they had recourse to “ghost-stories;” and, the lights having been put out, they grouped themselves upon chairs, settees, cushions, and the floor, listening in awe-struck silence to the low whisper of the story-teller of the moment. The spectacle was striking. Through the tall windows the pallid moonlight streamed into the large apartment, projecting fantastic shadows on the carpet; the silken dresses of the young girls shimmered in the weird light, and the darker costumes of their male companions assumed a lugubrious and funereal appearance, the figures but half defined in the gloom. At last the ghost-story, related in a low, awe-struck whisper, was over, and the group drew a long breath. A second and a third narration followed—the mournful splendor of the moonlight seemed to deepen—the shadow of the great oak without, through whose leaves a wind swept, waved upon the floor, making all turn their heads quickly—and when suddenly the great clock struck, with its clangorous, metallic sound, in the darkness, something like a shiver ran through every frame. The last story ended, and a deep silence followed. It was broken by Lou Brand, who, essaying to laugh, but failing lamentably, said: “Well, girls, there is but one thing more for us to do, and that is, to eat the dumb-cake to-night.” “Yes, yes!” came from the rest. “Who will venture?” continued the young lady. “It is said to be a fearful ordeal, and mamma tells of a young lady, a friend of hers once, who saw a sight so dreadful that she went distracted.” Exclamations of terror and curiosity greeted these words. “What was it?” The young lady shook her head. “You may laugh at me,” she replied, “for saying so, but these ghost-stories have made me nervous. I tried to make a jest just now, and failed. I cannot tell you mamma's story—I could not sleep after it. And I think, upon the whole, that it would be as well not to eat the dumb-cake to-night.” But this proposition was received with murmurs. “No harm can result from it,” said one. “I will venture,” said another. “And I.” “And I,” said a third and fourth. “Well,” said the young lady, “if you are resolved, I will not dissuade you. But, as there are so many candidates, you must draw lots.” This was readily agreed to, and, procuring a wheat-straw, the young lady divided it into a number of pieces of equal length, with the exception of one, which was very short, and grasped them in her hand, the protruding ends exactly coinciding. “Form a circle on the floor, now,” she said, “and I will stand in the centre, and each can draw.” About half a dozen of the young girls promptly obeyed, and the protestations of her companions induced Honoria, very much against her will, to become one of the group. “Each draw one straw, now,” said Lou Brand; “the girl who draws the shortest will be the one.” The ceremony was performed in solemn silence. Each in turn drew. “Now hold up your hands.” This was done. “You have drawn the short straw, Honoria,” said Lou Brand to her sister, “and you must go through the ordeal.” “Oh, I cannot!” exclaimed Honoria. But this was protested against by all; and Honoria found herself doomed to eat the dumb-cake.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">XIX. TERROR. The singular rite styled eating the dumb-cake was one of those superstitious ceremonies which, whether derived from half - civilized and credulous African nurses, or having their origin far back beyond memory, had taken fast hold upon the imaginations of the young at this period. The origin of the name is difficult to determine, especially as no cake of any description was eaten. Was the name metaphorical, and did it signify that those who performed the ceremony saw sights which sealed their lips, rendering them dumb as to the mystery? It is certain, at least, that there was something sombre and mysterious about the rite — a knowledge of which was carefully concealed from all but the female sex; and the preparations for it were weird and fantastic. First, the maiden selected to perform the ceremony was to leave all her companions and await the hour of eleven at night. Then she was to take a bucket, proceed silently and alone to the mystic spot where three streams met, fill the bucket, and then gain with it the chamber selected for the mysterious ceremony. All was to be performed without assistance. No other human being must be near. Having reached her chamber, she was to deposit the bucket on the floor, doff her garments, and, when ready to retire, dip the sleeve of the garment which she had worn nearest her person in the water, and place it upon a chair. These ceremonies, it was supposed, would consume nearly an hour, and midnight would be near when they were finished. The neophyte was then to stand perfectly motionless and silent, awaiting the stroke of midnight. The strokes were to be counted in silence from “one” to “twelve.” At the stroke of twelve the maiden was to look over her shoulder into a mirror placed for the purpose—and the result would be, that she would see her future husband! It will now be understood why Honoria was reluctant to join the group. and had exclaimed, “Oh, I cannot!” when the lot fell to her; and why, in both cases, she permitted herself to be overruled. She wished and she did not wish to see her “future husband”—for these two words conjured up the form of Edmund Innis. Superstitious, like all at that epoch, she had a lurking belief in the mysterious ceremony, and shrunk from attempting thus to read that future which must bring her joy or misery in connection with Innis. She had yielded, however, ashamed of herself, it may be, or saying, “It is nothing.” When the whole party soon afterward retired to their respective apartments, Honoria went to her own, where on this night no companion was to share her couch, and resolutely prepared for the mysterious ordeal. An unexpected obstacle suddenly presented itself. The night, which had been hitherto fair, had gradually become over-clouded; in the distance was heard the low muttering of thunder; and from moment to moment sullen flashes of far lightning divided the night. “If I go, I must go now, and I have promised,” murmured the girl. It was not far that she must go to procure the mystic water. In a dell, overshadowed by great trees, a few hundred yards from the house, three small rivulets, tributaries of the Rivanna, mingled their waters within a few feet of each other; and toward this spot, holding in her hand the bucket, Honoria now hastened. The night had become darker and darker, the heavens more and more obscured by the huge masses of inky clouds, which were divided at every instant by vivid lightnings. These dazzling serpents, appearing and vanishing as suddenly, were followed by the hoarse roar of thunder; and, terrified by this uproar of the elements, Honoria hastened on as rapidly as possible, to reach the desired point. As she did so, terror gradually took possession of her. Her pulse beat feverishly, and her quick breathing indicated that she was nearly overcome by fright. But her word was given, and her character for resolution at stake. She must go on, and she did so—pale, terrified, stumbling as she ran. The shadowy boughs above her seemed to reach down spectral hands to grasp her and bear her away. The bushes took the shape of something weird and fearful lying in wait for her. When, suddenly, an owl uttered his ghostly laughter near, she shrunk, and nearly fainted from terror. How she had strength to proceed she could never explain, but she resolutely went on, reached the spot, filled the bucket, and hurried back toward the hall, panting, tottering, dizzy, and stumbling as she ran from the fiery lightning, whose red finger seemed to be feeling for her in the darkness. Her will supported her, nevertheless, and at last her foot struck the sill of the side-door by which she intended to gain her chamber. Here her strength gave way, and she sank down, nearly overcome by nervous agitation. A few moments, however, sufficed for the recovery of her strength, and, raising the bucket once more, she mounted painfully with the heavy weight to her chamber. There all was still, and nothing was heard but the low sound of the fire, which, in anticipation of the coolness of the autumn night, had been kindled some hours before in the great fireplace. The wood had been nearly all consumed —a few brands only were left, which had fallen from the andirons, and around these the flames, about to expire, were licking with their snake-like tongues. Without, the storm raged with violence, and the ghastly glare of the moon, seen from time to time, as the ebon clouds drifted away before the wind, only made the night more lugubrious. “Oh, I cannot, I cannot!” exclaimed the girl, looking around her with a shudder. “I am not well, I am nervous— sick—” She went toward the fire, as though that were something cheerful and friendly; and, seating herself in a great arm-chair, endeavored to regain her calmness.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">XX. THE DUMB-CAKE. In spite of every effort made by Honoria, she found it impossible to recover her calmness. It is probable that the prolonged loss of rest, incident upon the festivities of the many preceding nights, had predisposed her to nervous agitation; but, whatever may have been the cause, she was now laboring under very great excitement, and shrunk, trembling, at every sound. The strange rite she was about to perform came to add the finishing touch to her agitation. There was the bucket, filled with the mysterious water from the weird locality where the three streams met; she looked sidewise at it, with a sudden quaking, as though it were some frightful and repellent monster, some hideous thing. This was to aid her in—in what? In seeing the figure of her future husband! At that thought, a quick blush came to the beautiful young face, driving away for an instant the expression of terror. It was the name Edmund that rose to her lips, and brought the crimson to her cheeks. Could any other person than Edmund ever sustain toward her that most sacred relation? Was it within the bounds of possibility that any one but Edmund could be her husband? At the very thought, the pale cheeks flushed, and she exclaimed in a low tone, “I would rather die!” Her own voice made her start, and she looked round fearfully. Every object seemed to have assumed a new character, becoming threatening or lugubrious. The shadows of the curtains on the wall resembled dark hands raised to strike her; the great oak without was a spectre peering in through her casement; the half-hideous, half-grotesque heads on the tops of the tall andirons seemed grinning at her terror and mocking her. The nervous agitation of the young lady had now attained almost its highest point. The storm roared with a fury more appalling than before. The shadows assumed more threatening shapes. At every sound, Honoria started, shuddering and gazing around her with affrighted eyes. This excitement grew at last so powerful that she scarcely dared to move. With a trembling frame and colorless cheeks she listened in an agony of terror, and once she wellnigh uttered a scream, for a low, painful breathing seemed to issue from the great white bed, which, with spectral curtains drawn together like a shroud, alternately appeared and vanished as the dying firelight leaped aloft or disappeared. The low breathing had scarcely ceased, when another source of agitation presented itself. Above the fireplace hung that portrait of the elder Lord Ruthven, Colonel Brand's friend, and the picture had changed its quarter from the colonel's dressing-room by a singular chance, which will be explained in the progress of the narrative. As Honoria gazed now at the dark, melancholy face, it seemed alive. The shadowy eyes were fixed upon her with terrifying intensity. She looked away, but they seemed to draw her, and there again was the dark, lugubrious gaze, full of mysterious meaning. Then the brows seemed to contract with a frown—the lips to assume an ominous and threatening expression—the portrait to move, and the figure to be about to step from the canvas "At three in the morning." p.43. 505EAF. Image of four women entering a bedroom where another woman is lying passed out on the floor. Two of the women are holding candles for light, while another is holding her hands clenched in front of her face. There is a large chair pulled in front of a cold fireplace and a heavily blanketed canopy bed can be seen on the left. and extend its shadowy hand toward her. Honoria rose to her feet, trembling and shuddering. Her terror had reached its climax. She felt that it was necessary to dissipate the fearful atmosphere around her, or she would fall fainting upon the floor. The thought of calling for assistance occurred to her, but the storm was too violent to admit of her being heard. Then she would become the laughing-stock of all—was she not overcome simply by foolish nervousness? No, she would not shrink. “I am no longer a child,” she murmured; “I must prove myself a woman, for his sake if not for my own!” She knelt and prayed, trembling, but firm in will. Then partly disrobing herself, the young lady dipped the sleeve of the snowy garment, worn next her person, in the bucket, placed it with a tremulous hand upon a chair, and went toward the mirror. At the same moment the great clock in the hall below began to strike midnight. Pale, trembling, with bare feet, hair falling upon her shoulders, and resembling rather a ghost than a human being, the young lady counted the strokes one after another, shuddering more and more as the number increased, and approached the terrible “twelve,” denoting midnight. Had she not been so completely mastered by terror, she might have seen two burning eyes watching her from behind the shroud - like curtains of the great bed. But she saw nothing; her eyes were half closed, and fixed upon the floor; one hand was placed upon her heart, to still its terrible throbbing. Suddenly the clock struck twelve: a fearful shudder convulsed the frame of Honoria; and, turning quickly, she looked into the mirror.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">XXI. AT THREE IN THE MORNING. The occurrences of this terrible night afterward became the topic of conversation far and wide in the region around Rivanna; and the point of most interest seemed to be the exact hour of the night at which the singular event—if there were such—took place. It was remembered that the party in the drawing-room separated at about eleven—the object having been to afford Honoria time to make her preparations, procure the water from the stream, and be in readiness at midnight for the ordeal of the dumb-cake. That she did make every preparation, and, in spite of the storm, reach the point where the three streams met, and return with the bucket of water, was soon ascertained—the bucket was there, and one of the maids had seen her pass through the grounds. She had regained the house, it was ascertained, some time before midnight; and certainly had time to arrange her night toilet, to perform the ceremony of dipping the sleeve of her garment in the water, and was ready to look into the mirror at the moment when the great clock in the hall below struck twelve. And yet the horrible incidents of the night must have taken place a considerable time after midnight—perhaps as late as one in the morning. There was no means, it is true, of accurately ascertaining this fact—that is to say, of fixing the precise hour; but the young ladies of the party were confident that they had listened for sounds from Honoria's room at midnight; were equally certain that they had heard nothing; and they had asserted that it was a considerable time after midnight, and just as they were retiring, when the piercing shriek which startled them was heard issuing from Honoria's apartment! The shriek was followed by a heavy fall. The whole party of young ladies, clad in their white night-dresses, ran, in undisguised alarm, to the chamber, and there a piteous sight met their eyes. Honoria was stretched upon the floor insensible, and, when they raised her, her companions gave a quick shudder; she hung upon their arms so inert and lifeless, that they thought her dead. Restoratives were quickly applied, and water dashed in the young girl's face, to arouse her; but, for a long time, these remedies had no effect. Meanwhile, Lady Brand had been sent for, and hurried to the chamber. As she ran to her child, calling to her in agonized tones, a faint color came to Honoria's cheeks; she opened her eyes, gazed vacantly around her, and then, clutching rather than simply embracing her mother, cried in a trembling and broken voice: “O mother!—protect me! do not leave me! protect me from that horror —on my shoulder!” As she spoke, she closed her eyes, and with a frightful shudder clung to her mother, as though for protection. She was borne to bed immediately, and Lady Brand requested the young ladies to retire, and leave her to tend her daughter. This they did with reluctance; but the apartment was soon vacated by all but Honoria, Lady Brand, and her eldest daughter. “Honoria has had some terrible shock—Heaven knows what!” said Lady Brand, supporting the trembling form of the half-inanimate girl in her arms on the bed. “What it was can be ascertained afterward; what is necessary now is a physician.” “Oh, yes, yes, mamma!” exclaimed her daughter, pale, and in tears. “Do not disturb Colonel Brand; he will be of no service. Send Cato—he is trusty—on the best horse in the stables, for Dr. Bond.” The young lady hurried to arouse Cato, who was soon in the saddle. An hour afterward, Dr. Bond ar rived—an elderly, solemn-looking gentleman, who “hummed” between his phrases, looked profound, and rounded his periods with sonorous scientific terms. He prescribed some trifle for Honoria, assuring Lady Brand that the young girl was “simply laboring under a slight nervous disorder, partaking of the character of, but not to be accurately designated, at least at the present moment, as hysteria; something had doubtless disagreed with her, and subsequent agitation on some subject, or, in fact, on no subject, would amply account for a slight attack which need occasion no alarm—no alarm whatever, I assure you, my dear madam.” On the afternoon of the next day, Honoria, who had passed the forenoon in a condition of half-consciousness only, began to grow animated, and had a magnificent color. “Look, doctor,” said Lady Brand to Dr. Bond. “I think my daughter's appearance indicates an access of fever.” “Hum!” said Dr. Bond, clearing his throat with extreme dignity, “it may be that there is a slight—hum—inclination to—as you say, madam—fever.” And, with a profound air, the doctor felt the young girl's pulse. “I know it is fever,” said Lady Brand, brusquely, and turning to Colonel Brand, who was seated, still and solemn, in the chamber, she exchanged a few words with him in a low tone, after which she left the apartment. Descending the staircase rapidly, Lady Brand was just passing through the hall, when suddenly she found herself face to face with a pale young man, whose white lips said: “What is the matter with Honoria, aunt?” Lady Brand seized his hand, and exclaimed: “I will tell you, when you return, Edmund. I intended to send Cato, but you will not return without him, if you have to drag him.” “Drag him! drag whom?” “Dr. Vandyke.” Innis gazed with startled eyes at Lady Brand. “Yes, Dr. Vandyke!” she repeated; “he must come at once, and see my child; this stupid Dr. Bond will let her die—” “Die!—good Heavens! of what?” “Of brain-fever.” As she was speaking, Lady Brand had hastened toward a desk in a corner of the hall, which contained pen, ink, and paper. Taking a sheet, she wrote upon it: “You said once that if I ever needed you, you would come, travelling night and day, if necessary. I need you now.” Signing and directing this note, she gave it to Innis. “Bring the doctor back with you, my son, and as soon as possible,” she said; “I have an instinct in diseases, and this of Honoria's is going to be critical.” Innis scarcely waited to hear the sentence finished. His thorough-bred, fresh and in fine condition, stood at the door; he was in the saddle in a minute, and disappeared at full gallop in the direction of Williamsburg. It seemed to Lady Brand a century since the departure of Innis, and she counted the hours, day and night, with feverish impatience — holding the hot face of Honoria in her bosom—giving her cooling draughts—striving to combat the disease until the arrival of the person for whom she had sent. Dr. Bond had taken up his residence at the hall, and still rounded his periods with serene dignity, drank the colonel's wine, and declared the case of Miss Brand one which would readily yield to treatment, unless another and more threatening phase was superinduced upon the present, which his diagnosis told him was— The voice droned on, and Lady Brand did not even seem to hear it. It was three in the morning, and she held the hot hand of the girl, listening. All at once she turned her head quickly. “He has come!” she said. “To whom, madam, may I ask, do you—hum—refer?” said Dr. Bond. Lady Brand was already at the door, a lamp in her hand; steps traversed the hall, and then mounted. “Well,” said a vibrating and metallic voice, “how is she?” And Dr. Vandyke came and grasped the hand of Lady Brand; his long, gray hair streaming around his face, in which burned two piercing eyes; his long overcoat covered with dust; his pipe-stem legs, lost in huge riding-boots, clattering as he walked. “How is Honoria?” “She is ill.” “Worse?” “Yes.” This dialogue terminated with a nod from Dr. Vandyke, who went into the chamber, and up to the bed. Dr. Bond was standing there in an attitude of much dignity. An expression of some surprise, and even hauteur, mingled with the dignity. “Hum,” he said, “I have the honor of seeing Dr.—” “Vandyke, at your service. How is Miss Brand?” This question was delivered with business-like brevity, and the tone of it contrasted strongly with that of Dr. Bond. The latter cleared his throat, and commenced an imposing sentence; but Dr. Vandyke, measuring his professional brother at one glance, proceeded unceremoniously to form his own opinion of the sufferer's condition. Lady Brand was at his side. After some moments' silence: “Well, doctor?” she said, anxiously. Dr. Vandyke said, briefly: “Well, madam?” That was all; he did not look at the lady. “What do you think of Honoria?” “She has brain-fever.” “The attack is dangerous?” “Hum—will you permit me, madam —if I might venture to express an opinion,” said Dr. Bond, with some hauteur, “Miss Brand has already improved under my treatment, and I do not regard her case as critical in its character.” Lady Brand bowed hurriedly, but looked at Dr. Vandyke. This look was unmistakable. “You desire my opinion of Miss Brand's condition, madam?” he said. “Yes, doctor.” He looked at her with a singular, wistful glance, and muttered: “You were always strong; superior in brain and nerve to any woman I ever knew—” “Doctor!” Lady Brand had begun to tremble from head to foot. “Speak, and speak plainly!” she said. “It is best. There is no more for me to learn of this case. The crisis will take place in three days. Honoria will then be convalescent, or—do you think you can stand the truth?” “Yes—yes! Speak.” “She will be dead!” A low groan from the door-way came like an echo to the words. Dr. Vandyke looked round — his steady gaze passing from the white face of Lady Brand to the face of him who had uttered the groan. It was Innis who, leaning upon the frame of the door, and gazing with eyes wet with tears upon the sick girl, had summed up as it were in this expression of anguish the despair under which it seemed to him his heart would break.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">XXII. THE CRISIS. Three days nearly, hour for hour, passed. During this time, Dr. Vandyke scarcely left for an instant the bedside of Honoria, scarcely tasted food, and concentrated every faculty of his powerful brain upon the wellnigh hopeless task of snatching the sick girl from the hand of Death stretched forth to clutch her. There was something sublime in this gigantic struggle of the eccentric dwarf, in his outré costume, with the supreme enemy of humanity. The conflict was breast to breast; science and the spirit of death wrestled over the wasted body; and at last the decisive moment came. It was an hour or two past midnight. The three days fixed by Dr. Vandyke, as the term of the struggle when the crisis would arrive, were about to expire. Honoria, wasted away to a phantom nearly, lay, or rather tossed to and fro, burnt up by the fearful fever which was preying upon all the sources of her life. In the group near the fireplace stood Colonel Brand, still, and overawed by the terrible spectacle; Lady Brand, pale, but with red rings around her eyes; her elder daughter, faint and sobbing; and Dr. Bond, who had lingered with unprofessional persistence, preserving still his air of offended dignity, but sullenly bending before the imperious will of Dr. Vandyke, who, standing at the head of the bed, watched the girl with an intensity which indicated the profound anxiety concealed beneath his collected expression. All felt that this man, in the long overcoat, with the elfin gray locks, was the master, and left all to him. The only sound which disturbed the silence from moment to moment was the brief, vibrating voice, demanding “Ice!” “More ice!” The burning temples seeming to melt it as soon as it was applied. The sick girl, with head thrown back, eyes closed or wandering, lips full of physical agony, and cruelly wasted already in face and form, was wrestling with the enemy of Life—Death, the pitiless, the inexorable. All at once the mutterings of agony gave place to words: “The breathing! the breathing! there in the bed!” exclaimed Honoria. As she uttered the words, she threw herself violently to the opposite side of the bed, and said in a scream almost: “The dagger!—the weight upon my shoulders!—that horror!—” Dr. Vandyke went quickly to Lady Brand, and uttered a few words. His communication must have been a request that all but the girl's mother and himself should leave the apartment, as Lady Brand spoke in a low tone to her husband, and all but herself and the physician went out of the chamber. “There is something terrible under all this,” said Dr. Vandyke, in a low tone, to the lady; “the case is mental— physical remedies are of little avail.” “O doctor, can nothing be done?” “Something — physical æsthesia is practicable; but—” “Help! help!” cried the girl, raising her hands as though to repulse some fearful object. Dr. Vandyke pressed the bandage containing ice to her forehead, and with the other hand forced her to receive between her lips some drops of an anodyne. “In ten minutes all will be decided,” he muttered. As he spoke, the girl fell back uttering a low moan, and then lay motionless. Her labored breathing only indicated life. Dr. Vandyke stood holding her pulse, and watching her with the eyes of a hawk. Some minutes passed thus; then the flery flush on the patient's face faded almost imperceptibly into a less crimson tint, the least observable moisture ap peared upon the forehead at the roots of the hair; and through the iron frame of the physician a tremor passed. “The pulse is moderating!” he said, in a low voice; “wait!” And drawing from its fob a large watch, he counted, fixing his eyes upon the dial. A minute passed in dead silence. “Ninety!” rang out sonorous, from the lips of the physician; and, turning to Lady Brand, he added: “Your daughter is saved!” An hour afterward there was no longer the least doubt of the patient's condition. She was sleeping almost sweetly— her brow bathed in perspiration, which Lady Brand, scarce able to suppress her sobs of joy, from time to time wiped away with a handkerchief. Dr. Vandyke was down-stairs eating voraciously, and oblivious apparently of the stately colonel and the dignified Dr. Bond, who were seated at the same table, drinking wine. “May I—ahem—have the pleasure, sir—” And Dr. Bond, from whose oracular lips issued these words, filled his glass, and pushed the bottle to Dr. Vandyke. “I never drink wine,” came in a species of snap from that personage. Dr. Bond drew back with hauteur. “Unfits a physician for his business,” said Dr. Vandyke, “and I don't want it. When I am hungry I eat.” “Obviously, sir,” was the remotely satirical reply of Dr. Bond. “Rode all day and all night to arrive,” said Dr. Vandyke, with his mouth full. “And—ahem—you think that Miss Brand—” “I never think!” Dr. Vandyke uttered the words with extreme curtness, and went on eating. “At least, sir,” responded Dr. Bond, with lofty politeness, “you have formed some theory — ahem — of Miss Brand's case?” “Theory?” “Theory I said, sir.” “No, I have formed no theory. I can see with my eyes. Miss Brand has brain-fever.” “I was also aware of that fact, sir,” said Dr. Bond, with immense politeness; “brain-fever, attributable to loss of rest, dissipation, and exposure.” “No.” “Do I—ahem—understand you, sir, to say—” “I don't know what you understand. Miss Brand has brain-fever produced by other causes.” “What causes?” “I decline to discuss the subject.” Dr. Bond rose with dignity. “If I am to be insulted in this house, Colonel Brand, I will no longer intrude. It seems that I am not only not to be consulted, but my natural inquiries— questions obviously drawn forth by the case, sir—are to be treated with indignity!” “I never answer questions, and I understand this case,” said Dr. Vandyke, pushing back his plate. “I am sent for by Lady Brand, and I treat the case.” A servant came at this moment to summon Dr. Vandyke to the sick-room, and he went thither at once, leaving Dr. Bond in such extreme wrath that he soon afterward left Rivanna in disgust. Honoria was still sleeping, and the healthful moisture still bathed her brow. “I am so anxious, doctor,” said the poor mother, in a whisper, “that I wish you to remain with me. I disturbed you in—” “No, I had finished; was undergoing a stupid interrogation from my brother Bond, who is an ass.” He felt the pulse of the girl, and said: “All is going on well, and the force of the fever is spent. In three days the body will begin to resume its normal functions; the mind remains.” “The mind, doctor?” “The mind; that will be the real struggle. Listen to me a moment.” And the physician drew Lady Brand toward the window. “I am perfectly familiar with this type,” he said; “it is simple—the patient gets well or dies quickly—all that is touch-and-go. What follows it is more terrible. I will not bewilder you with scientific terms. In brief words, Honoria's attack will be followed by permanent melancholy, hysteria, and worse, unless a peculiar course is pursued in her case. I will write to-day, delegating my business in the capital to an associate, and remain here—” “Oh, thanks—thanks!” Dr. Vandyke looked at Lady Brand with a peculiar expression. When he spoke his voice was no longer cold and vibrating. “I want no thanks,” he said. “People call me eccentric. Well, one of my eccentricities is to regard the daughter of the woman I once loved as my own. You were my only—well, what people call their romance! I should have been happy had you married me, and you less happy—but enough of this. Let me finish. In five days from this time Honoria will have recovered in a great degree from her fever, and then we must combat the mental malady which will surely supervene. I will instruct you when and how to make your inquiries. This will be of importance. That very dignified dunderhead down-stairs thinks the attack produced by loss of rest, which is pure nonsense. It is the result of terror—of a breathing heard in that bed on the night of her seizure — of something which sprung or fell upon her shoulders—of, I know not what, and yet I will know!” “Is it possible, doctor!” “Of that and that alone. Let us, for the present, however, combat the physical malady—the mental must wait.” The doctor went and sat down, as he spoke, in the great, high-backed arm-chair, upon which Honoria had placed the garment dipped in the mystic water. As he did so, he glanced quickly toward the mirror beyond, as though impressed by some sudden idea connected with the relative positions of the two objects. His present aim, however, seemed to be to snatch a little sleep. “I have not closed my eyes for forty-eight hours, and am a little fatigued,” he said. “This is an excellent bed—if you will permit, madam—I never snore!” And, closing his eyes, the doctor fell asleep almost instantly — his fantastic legs, ending in huge feet and buckled shoes, stretched out straight before him; his arms folded across his broad chest, and his face nearly concealed by the long, gray locks of his hair.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">XXIII. DR. VANDYKE AND LADY BRAND. Ten days after the scenes just described, Lady Brand and Dr. Vandyke were seated alone in the library at a late hour of the night, engaged in earnest conversation. Colonel Brand had retired some time before, and no sound was heard throughout the great mansion, save the ticking of the tall clock in its corner in the hall, and the sighing of the autumn wind in the trees without. Dr. Vandyke was half-buried in a large arm-chair, whose yielding cushions made him resemble more than ever a cut-off giant; and his pipe-stem legs were supported on a velvet footstool, in the full light of the wax-candles in silver candelabra—the light, soft but clear, bringing out in grand relief the enormous feet in their huge buckled shoes. The gray hair was pushed back for once from his forehead; his eyes were animated; he seemed to concentrate all the faculties of his mind upon the communication being made to him by Lady Brand, who, seated opposite him, spoke in a rapid and somewhat agitated voice, rising erect occasionally in her seat, and then leaning back again. “I have obeyed your instructions,” she said. “This evening Honoria was so composed that I ventured to question her upon the occurrences of that unfortunate night.” “Ah!” came in a low voice from Dr. Vandyke. “I was most anxious to do so,” continued Lady Brand, “for what you predicted has duly come to pass. My child is nearly well of her mere physical disease, but the terrible melancholy and nervous prostration, which you foretold, have come to torture me and fill me with foreboding. She starts at the least noise; never smiles, or seems at rest even; there is a constant tendency to shudder observable in her; and once or twice at the least trifle—the movement of a shadow—my suddenly rising from my chair —she has half screamed.” Dr. Vandyke said, quickly: “A shadow? — rising from your chair?” “Yes, the shadow of any object thrown upon the curtains or wall by the firelight—the lights are often put out, to avoid the glare.” “Ah! shadows, then, affright her. Hum!—well. And rising from your chair? What chair?” “The large one, in which I sit when not at the bedside.” “The invalid - chair, with a high back?” “Yes.” “It remains in its former position?” “Yes; 'tis really too heavy to be moved easily, and stands, you know, facing the fire, with the back to the bureau.” “Upon which is the mirror, is it not?” “Yes, doctor; but pray what importance can attach to—” “I will return to that point. Shadows!—rising from the chair!—hum!— Will you be good enough to continue, madam? You this evening questioned Honoria: tell me in detail what you have discovered.” “I shall be able to do so in a few words. The subject seemed to agitate her fearfully, and nothing but your express injunction could have induced me to press my questions.” “Right; but my injunctions were necessary. The mental disease has supervened. The physical has yielded to treatment; the mental must be treated, too, unless you wish a corpse in your house. What does the child say?” “I will tell you succinctly the result of the conversation; that is, all that I discovered. You know what preceded the attack, and caused it. The young ladies on a visit to us determined to perform the superstitious ceremony of eating the dumb-cake, as it is called—of looking into a mirror to see their future husbands—all absurd, but an old pastime —and Honoria was chosen to undergo the ordeal. She acquiesced with great reluctance, but was persuaded to comply, and courageously went through the ceremony of going in person for a bucket of water to the spot where three streams met, and bearing it to her chamber. It is probable that this agitated her, as the night was dark, and a fearful storm was in progress. She went, however, to the point, a few hundred yards from the house, returned hastily, and, at nearly midnight, gained her chamber.” Dr. Vandyke listened with absorbed attention. “Well,” he said, briefly. “Having reached her apartment, Honoria proceeded to perform the other ceremonies dictated by this absurd super stition, of removing the under-garment next to her body, and dipping one of its sleeves into the bucket.” “Yes,” said Dr. Vandyke. “During the performance of all this —I mean during the process of undressing, and preparing to retire—Honoria declares that her agitation was very great. It is probable that loss of rest, arising from the late hours kept during the visit of her young guests, may have predisposed her nerves to be thus affected; but it is possible that the storm had been chiefly instrumental in exciting her. Whatever the cause may have been, it is plain, from her statement, that her agitation was excessive, and that every object around her assumed a threatening and terrifying character. The curtains of the bed took the shape, she declares, of a shroud; the shadows were terrifying, and a low breathing issued from the bed, behind which something, she knew not what, seemed to be moving.” “`Something,' you say—`something' is vague,” said Dr. Vandyke; “did Honoria describe in any manner this something?” “She could not. I laughed, of course —told her 'twas nothing—had she seen any thing?—to which her agitated response was, that she had seen nothing at all, but saw the curtains move, and heard the breathing.” “The breathing? Ah! the breathing!” said Dr. Vandyke, in a low voice; “this is so persistently alluded to, first in delirium, now in a lucid condition of mind—well, decidedly, I begin to think —but continue, madam. Honoria heard this low breathing from the bed whose curtains were shroud-like—started at the shadows—aught more?” “But one circumstance, preceding the real terror of the night, which occurred an hour later.” “That is to say, at about one in the morning?” “Yes.” “And this circumstance, coming at twelve, to add its effect to the breathing and the shadows?” “It was more singular than agitating. I should have enumerated, among the causes of Honoria's agitation, the strange idea that a portrait hanging over the fireplace followed her with its eyes, enjoyed her terror, and, at last, stretched out its hand to seize her.” “The poor child must indeed have labored under nervous excitement. What portrait was it? I did not note it.” “That of Lord Ruthven—father, I believe, of the young nobleman now in Williamsburg.” “Ah! How does it chance that this portrait is here?” “Lord Ruthven the elder was a friend of Colonel Brand's, and presented him, after the European fashion, with his picture.” “Well; but 'twas singular that it should adorn your daughter's chamber, was it not?” “That is not the least strange incident. Another portrait hung there until within a day or two of the time of this unhappy incident—a portrait of my grandfather, the elder Colonel Seaton. By some means the cord attaching the picture to the hook in the wall broke, from age and moths, perchance; the picture fell—the fall broke the frame to pieces, and thus the portrait could not conveniently be rehung in its former position.” Dr. Vandyke nodded. “So you replaced it with another?” “Yes, the space on the wall covered by the picture was clearly defined from the rest of the wall, and unsightly. I therefore removed from Colonel Brand's dressing - room the portrait of Lord Ruthven, and hung it in the place of the former.” “Well; and this picture was one of the sources of Honoria's terror?” “Yes, it seemed to follow her with its eyes, and attempt to seize her; and, added to her other causes of agitation, this nearly unstrung her nerves.” “Yes.” “She rose to her feet, from the chair on which she sat, and, kneeling before which, she had performed her devotions.” “The great chair?” “Yes.” “Continue, madam.” “And then it was that, having performed the ceremony of dipping the sleeve of her under-garment in the bucket, she turned to the mirror, just as the clock struck midnight, to see her future husband.” “Ah!—and she saw—?” “The portrait of Lord Ruthven.” “The portrait!” “Yes, doctor. It hung above the fireplace; and the mirror, you know, stands against the opposite wall, the bed being on the right as you go toward it, and the large double window on the left.” “Yes, yes!” “Thus, in looking into the mirror, Honoria saw the reflection of the portrait behind her.” “Simple and absurd! So the dead Lord Ruthven was to be her future husband, since 'twas him she saw in the magic mirror?” Dr. Vandyke uttered a grunt. “We will talk of this at another time,” he said. “It is unimportant now. This did not cause Honoria to shriek and faint?” “Oh, no! It simply made her more nervous, but the reflection of the object in the mirror was obviously so natural that it impressed her instantly.” “Her next proceeding?” “She retired quickly to the great bed, from which the breathing was no longer heard; and it was about an hour afterward, when she had been asleep for a brief space of time, that the horror of the night came.” Dr. Vandyke made a slight movement with his head, and said: “We come now to the point of most importance in the case. What was this horror? Relate, as minutely as possible, what occurred.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">XXIV. THE HORROR. Lady Brand paused for some moments, and seemed to labor under very great agitation. “My poor child!” she said, at length. “Doctor, you can scarcely conceive how dangerously excited she grew while relating the last and most terrible events of this horrible night. She became as white as a corpse, her voice was almost hollow in its accent; and, O doctor, doctor! there was something in the expression of her eyes which I did not like—I feared—” “Yes, and justly. Your daughter has narrowly escaped death from brain-fever: what I aim at now is to prevent what is worse than death—insanity.” Lady Brand sobbed for some moments, but recovered her self-command at length, and said, firmly: “I shall give you the exact substance of Honoria's statement, doctor—a statement made in broken words, as I held her in my arms. She shook with nervous excitement; but there is something in being near a mother's heart which calms a child, I think, and gives assurance of safety. Honoria seemed to feel this, and, spite of her frightful agitation, went through with her narrative up to the moment when she fainted and fell.” “In front of the mirror?” “Yes, doctor.” Dr. Vandyke knit his brows, and seemed to be concentrating all the faculties of his mind upon one single idea. “Allow me to ask you one or two questions before you proceed,” he said. The lady inclined her head and listened. “Has any change been made in the position of the furniture?” “In Honoria's chamber, you mean?” “Yes.” “None at all. Every thing remains in the same position which it formerly occupied.” “Good! that simplifies matters. Now, madam, let us see. Entering the chamber by the single door—for there is but one door, I believe?” “But one,” said Lady Brand, indicating, by the expression of her countenance, the surprise which she felt at this apparently irrelevant question. The doctor perceived this expression, and said: “I will indicate later the object of these interrogatories. In entering your daughter's apartment you have, immediately upon your right, the fireplace; in front of it the large arm-chair, facing the fire; against the opposite wall the toilet-table and mirror; on the left of the mirror a double window; on the right the great bed. Is that all, madam?” “With the exception of the ordinary number of chairs, stools, the carpet, and an old linen-chest.” “A chest? In what part of the room is this chest?” “In the corner beyond the fireplace. But it is not used now; the key has been lost, and the chest has not been opened, I think, for twenty years.” “Hum! I care nothing, however, for the chest; and I have in my mind now a picture of the theatre of this strange drama. A fireplace, with a portrait above it—a great chair in front—a mirror against the opposite wall—a window, a bed, and in this bed Honoria asleep at half an hour or an hour past midnight. What then occurred, madam?—something frightful, I fear, and any scientific propensity to sneer or jest dies in me at the thought of Honoria. This child has seen, or believes she has seen, something terrible—some object such as the grave gives up when the cerements of the dead are torn away—speak, now, and tell me what this horror was!” “I shall proceed to do so,” said Lady Brand, in a low and nervous voice. “I have scarce recovered from the shock of the narrative, and recall every particular.” “Good,” said Dr. Vandyke, fixing his penetrating eyes on the face of the lady; “it is precisely these particular details which I wish to ascertain. I know that Honoria saw something—was assailed by something, or that she fancied as much—and that she shrieked and fainted. What I wish now to know is the hour of the night, the position she occupied at the moment—all—and especially what seems trifling and unimportant.” “You shall know all, doctor, and in as brief terms as possible. Honoria declares that she retired at a few minutes past midnight, and lay awake for some time, the victim of nervous agitation. The breathing which had so much alarmed her was no longer heard, and the portrait was thrown into shadow now; but it was some time before she could compose herself sufficiently to sleep. Finally, however, exhaustion brought on slumber, or rather a species of half-consciousness, and she either saw or dreamed that she saw a gigantic and shadowy arm—in the hand a dagger—and this arm rose and fell three times, striking the weapon into the white garment which Honoria had placed upon the chair.” “Well,” said Dr. Vandyke, coolly, “what next?” “The occurrence was so real—or the vision so vivid—that Honoria declares she must have fainted. When she opened her eyes—in a few minutes, as she supposes—the apartment was darker than before, and the storm which had raged up to this time was dying away. All was still, except the far mutter of thunder and the low hissing of the expiring fire. It must then have been nearly one in the morning, and Honoria felt a new access of terror at the thought that she alone, in all probability, was awake in the house. By degrees, however, this terror moderated; she began to reason with herself upon the occurrences of the night. Might that all have been the result of her fancy— the product of a diseased imagination starting at the simplest noises? The breathing might have been the sighing of the wind in the great oak without— the arm striking at the garment a mere effect of light and shadow—the strange expression of the portrait undoubtedly a fantasy. Honoria, doctor, is of a very delicate and sensitive organization, but then she is a girl of excellent sense too; and this process of reasoning upon her fears gradually restored her self-possession and in some degree quieted her nerves.” The doctor nodded. “I know the class to which she belongs,” he said, “the nervous-sanguine-lymphatic. Proceed, madam.” “Honoria reached at last, doctor, a degree of composure which induced her to resolve upon discovering whether there were any grounds for what appeared to her to be an absurd fancy, if not a dream—to ascertain, in a word, whether the garment or the chair were not injured. If the weapon in the hand of the shadow had been a real weapon and had pierced the garment, there must be some hole or rent to show where the point had entered; if there were none, then it was a dream. This resolution she proceeded to carry out. She rose from bed, stole in her bare feet to the spot where the garment hung, raised it in the glimmering half-light from the dying fire, and was about to examine it, when there suddenly fell to the floor, with a ringing clash, an antique poniard—!” Dr. Vandyke shook his head. “The case is worse than I had supposed,” he muttered. Lady Brand continued, with white cheeks now, and a tremor in her voice: “The worst of all, the most terrifying event of all was yet to come!” she said, almost in a whisper. The doctor bent forward—this time with a fixed and piercing look which indicated that even his ever-firm nerves began to be affected by the strange recital. “That is not all, then—but I had forgotten!—the `horror'—the `weight upon the shoulders'—!” “You recall the delirious raving of my child, I see!” said Lady Brand, trembling. “A few words more will tell you all. When the weapon fell, or when Honoria thought it fell, she recoiled from the chair, turning her head from it, and covering her face, when suddenly, she declares, some horrible thing or being leaped or fell upon her shoulders— clutched her, and, crouching like a cat, gibbered and tore at her with its teeth!” Dr. Vandyke had grown a little pale, and shook his head ominously. “What next?” he said, in a low voice. “It was then that Honoria uttered the piercing shriek which attracted her companions to her chamber, and fell fainting upon the floor. After this she remembers nothing.” “One word before you finish, madam,” and Dr. Vandyke knit his brows. “You say that Honoria recoiled from the chair, turning away her head?” “Yes.” “Then her back was to the large chair?” “Yes.” “Her face to the mirror?” “Yes.” “Did she look into the mirror—if so, what did she see, or fancy she saw?” “I was about to tell you,” said Lady Brand, in the same awe-struck whisper. “The apartment was nearly in total darkness, but Honoria's quick glance toward the mirror showed her a shadowy, crouching thing upon her back—a name less something of no defined shape—then, paralyzed by this final terror, she lost consciousness and fell heavily to the floor.” Dr. Vandyke remained for some moments buried in gloomy meditation. He then raised his head, and uttered a deep sigh. “Nothing, of course, was found when the young ladies went to the chamber?” he said. “Nothing.” “The garment was on the chair still?” “Yes.” “There were no rents in it?” “None.” “No dagger on the floor?” “None.” “And Honoria was alone—the chamber had no other occupant?” “I know that there was no one else in the apartment; I reached it almost as soon as the girls, and, thinking that a dog or something else beneath the bed— there is no other place of concealment— had frightened Honoria, instituted an immediate search.” “And there was nothing?” “Nothing.” “The room has no closet?” “None, doctor.” Dr. Vandyke reflected again, preserving the same melancholy silence. “And this is all, madam?” “All, doctor.” “You have omitted nothing?” “Nothing whatever that I can recall.” The doctor uttered something like a groan. “God help us!” he muttered. “O doctor, what do you mean?” Dr. Vandyke looked at the lady with eyes full of pity. “I mean, madam,” he said, solemnly, “that the inscrutable Power which rules this world and all the worlds has seen fit to visit you with a great misfortune.” “O doctor, doctor! speak! — tell me—!” “You are strong, and should know. Honoria has—dormant in her mental organization, and in process of development at this moment—insanity.” Lady Brand sobbed hopelessly, covering her pale face with her hands. “And is there no cure?” she said, in a broken voice. “Perhaps,” said Dr. Vandyke. “The case is a strange one, madam—you see I waste no time in commonplace consolation, in soothing expressions. Your lady friends will furnish that—I am the physician, and this time the physician not only of the body but the mind. I have cured the body nearly—the mind remains; and to cure that will be more difficult. I shall nevertheless do all in my power, leaving the rest to that all-wise and all-merciful Being disregarded or not believed in by fools and savants, but in whom I believe; to whom I look, as the first great cause, the arbiter of all.” Dr. Vandyke rose as he spoke. “To-morrow, madam,” he said, “I shall make my diagnosis fully, and commence my treatment.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">XXV. TREATMENT. When Dr. Vandyke came down-stairs on the next morning, he found Lady Brand in the library, and requested her to walk upon the lawn and converse with him for a few moments. The lady rose quickly, drying with her handkerchief some tears that were in her eyes, and the two persons walked out beneath the great oaks and disappeared. They did not return for an hour. As they came back toward the house, it was obvious, from the expression of Dr. Vandyke's countenance, that the result of the colloquy had been such as to afford him extreme satisfaction. The melan choly air which had characterized him on the preceding evening had disappeared; his demeanor was animated, and he murmured: “I know, or think I know! Now, to find if my knowledge will prove of any avail!” On the same evening, he went to Honoria's chamber with Lady Brand. The girl lay still and quiet in her great white bed, her eyes dreamy and full of apathy. Dr. Vandyke uttered a cheerful laugh. “Well, my dear child,” he said, as he approached her, “the roses are coming back to their native soil—your cheeks.” Honoria raised her great eyes, set like stars in the wasted face, and looked at the speaker in a dreamy way. Then she tried to smile, but closed her eyes as though the effort overcame her. “I have never seen anybody get well so quickly,” said Dr. Vandyke, in a cheery voice. Honoria made no reply. “You have been quite sick, my child,” continued the doctor, in his hearty tone, “and we have all felt much solicitude; but nothing in this world is unalloyed—not even unhappiness. Sickness has its comforts; one of these is the sympathy of our friends, and everybody has been to see you. Those who could not be admitted, have left messages, and my young friend Edmund Innis commissioned me—” The pale face suddenly flushed, and the great eyes opened. At that name, some of the apathy disappeared. “His message is, that you must soon get well, and—” The doctor bent down and added: “He says you are his sunshine, and that he cannot live in darkness.” It is to be hoped that this flat falsehood was blotted from the book of the recording angel. It caused Honoria to look up eagerly, and brought back to her face something almost like animation. Dr. Vandyke saw his advantage, and pressed it. “Well, little Miss Sunshine,” he said, laughing, “I hope you will begin to shine down-stairs very soon now, and, when I return to visit this respectable family, I expect to find you tripping over the lawn, or dancing gavottes and reels to the music of the fiddle.” Honoria shook her head. “You are not going away, doctor?” she said. “Yes.” “And leave me?” “Why not?” “I am not well,” she said, wearily. “You will be in a week.” “No, no!” Dr. Vandyke gazed at her with his subtile and penetrating glance, and from the quiet change in his expression it was evident that he had made up his mind to act promptly and with vigor. “Why do you indulge this melancholy mood, my dear child,” he said, “you are rapidly recovering. You sleep well, do you not?” “Yes,” came in a hesitating voice. “No fancies, and imaginary sounds, I suppose—no low breathing—ha! ha!— from behind your bed?” Honoria shuddered, closing her eyes. “That was the most absurd and laughable idea imaginable,” said Dr. Vandyke; “or at least to be frightened by it. A breathing!—why, there it is now!” Honoria half started up. “O doctor!” she exclaimed. “What is it? I'll find!” And, raising the counterpane, the astute Dr. Vandyke drew forth a small spaniel, the pet of Lou Brand, who had placed the dog there while Honoria was asleep, in compliance with the request of the physician. That personage burst into a hearty laugh. “Well, after all, you were right, my dear!” he said, “there was a frightful low breathing—Carlo, to wit.” It could be seen at a glance that this prosaic and commonplace explanation of one source of her nocturnal terror had made a profound impression upon Honoria. She did not speak, but her eyes spoke volumes. “This habit that dogs have of creeping under beds to sleep or protect themselves from flies, is one of the greatest objections to making household pets of them,” said the doctor. And, turning to Carlo, he added, laughing: “Come, my interesting young friend, will you be good enough to entertain us by your peculiar wheeze, attributable doubtless to dog-asthma?” As though in response to these words, Carlo, who had stretched himself upon the floor, uttered a low, asthmatic sound, as though he experienced a difficulty in breathing. Dr. Vandyke looked sidewise at Honoria. She was silent, but he saw that her mind had received the impression which he aimed to produce. “Go out now, if you please, Mr. Carlo,” he said, “and play in the sunshine. There is a superb amount of it to-day.—And, by-the-by, madam,” he continued, addressing Lady Brand, “is there not too much light in this chamber? It may be painful to your daughter's eyes.” Lady Brand went to close the blinds. “But no,” said Dr. Vandyke, “'tis better, perhaps — more cheerful; and these shadows moving to and fro on the wall are cool and refreshing. What singular shapes they take!—the bough of the great oak yonder resembles an arm grasping a dagger, and, if a good strong wind were to arise, I can fancy that the shadow, especially by moonlight, would appear fearful—would become, in fancy, a gigantic arm and poniard raised to strike.” Honoria started again. She was gazing at Dr. Vandyke, with her whole soul in her eyes. “What are you looking at, my dear child?” he said, cheerfully. “You really make me afraid with your intense gaze! 'Tis as bad as the look of the old fellow up yonder, who has been staring me out of countenance since my entrance. Look at him!” And, taking a broomstick, Dr. Vandyke got up on a chair, thrust the stick into Lord Ruthven's face, and assumed the persuasive attitude of a public lecturer upon science, with accompanying diagrams. “Behold the queer conformation of the human eye, so well depicted here!” he said, poking the portrait in the eye with a movement so awkward that it was wellnigh impossible not to laugh. “It seems to follow you—speak to you—go to the right or left, it still looks at you— stares at you: this absurd, painted, human eye!—Really, madam,” he said to Lady Brand, “I would take this grum and disagreeable fellow out. Did you say the wall was disfigured behind it?” He suddenly thrust the picture to one side and showed the wall. “See, it is nothing; remove it, madam, or each time you enter this room you will have this old Sir Blunderbuss following you with his eyes.” “I will remove it to-day, doctor, as you suggest.” “Oh, 'tis not so important. For myself, all the pictures in the world may stare at me.—Shut your stupid eyes, my dear Sir Blunderbuss!” And administering a final poke with the broomstick into the face of the picture, Dr. Vandyke descended, laughing, to the floor. As he did so, he glanced furtively at Honoria. She was smiling, either at the absurd antics of the peculiar personage, or with a sense of relief from old fears connected with the portrait, thus turned completely into ridicule. Dr. Vandyke prepared for the final scene of his acting. Suddenly he mounted into the great high-backed chair standing in front of the fireplace, leaned his arms on the huge back, rested his enormous head, with its long, elfin gray locks, upon the folded arms, and grinned amiably. His expression was so ludicrous indeed that Honoria uttered a slight laugh. A quick glance from Dr. Vandyke toward Lady Brand seemed to warn her that her aid in the performance was now required. She moved to the space between the chair and the mirror, and turned toward the latter, when, with the agility of a cat, Dr. Vandyke bounded over the back of the great chair, and lit upon her shoulder. Honoria uttered a scream, and cried: “O doctor! The frightful thing!— the horror!” “The nonsense and tomfoolery, my dear child,” said Dr. Vandyke, with a laugh, and lighting on his feet; “call things by their right names, and let us have done with absurdities.” Honoria was looking at him with animated eyes. A sudden revulsion seemed to have taken place in her feelings—a change in her mental condition. There was no longer in her eyes that vacant and apathetic expression which had made the heart of the experienced physician sink within him—a natural and healthful light began to animate her glance; the medicine for the mind was having its effect, like the medicine for the body. No sooner had Dr. Vandyke descried this longed-for alteration in Honoria, than he said to Lady Brand: “I will go and write some letters now, madam, and I think Honoria had best sleep a little. Place the bell beside her hand, and show me where I may write.” Lady Brand quietly obeyed, and went toward the door. Dr. Vandyke followed her, but suddenly turned. “I had nearly forgotten you, my grum friend,” he said to the portrait of Lord Ruthven. And, mounting with agility upon a chair, he placed one foot upon an abutment of the mantel-piece, and unceremoniously pulled down the fearful portrait, which he tucked under his arm and bore from the apartment. As soon as the door was closed, Dr. Vandyke's face assumed its habitual expression of coolness, and, taking a large handkerchief from his coat-pocket, he wiped his forehead. “Acting fatigues!” he said; “but the end is reached—or nearly.” “Yes, yes, doctor!” He deposited the picture in a corner, and gave it a kick. “I would put that rubbish in the garret, madam,” he said, “and hang above Honoria's fireplace a flower-piece or cheerful landscape. All depends now upon trifles. Let her reflect, and allow my medicine to work. To-morrow I hope to finish the cure.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">XXVI. THE MYSTERY. When Dr. Vandyke entered Honoria's chamber, on the next morning, his countenance wore the same cheerful and animated expression. “Well, my dear,” he said, “any more shadows—breathings, etc., etc.?” A last remnant of nervous agitation passed through the frame of the young lady, but she replied in a sweet and serious tone: “Oh, no! I hope these fancies have left me—” “Ah, ah! you call them fancies, do you? That shows that you are cured.” “They must have been fancies, doctor; and yet—that strange thing—” The old shudder came back, and Honoria's eyes assumed an expression which induced Dr. Vandyke to exclaim: “Come, come! every thing in order. I will come to that!” “Come to it, doctor?” “Yes, my dear, I propose to deliver a brief lecture this morning upon natural phenomena, with the effect produced by them upon the human mind. The term lecture may fright you, but be tranquil. I aim only to explain a circumstance or two. It will be best that you should have this explanation.” “Yes, doctor.” “And you feel, I hope, that affection as well as professional duty prompts it?” “Yes, yes, indeed! Something in your face tells me that you have for me —that you really—love me!” “My face interprets my heart, Honoria,” said the eccentric physician, with a quick flush; and, taking in his own the thin, white hand of the girl, he said, earnestly: “I loved your mother once, Honoria —I mean, was her suitor; and what better means could I adopt, to prove the sincerity of my love, than to cure her child? I have effected this cure, or nearly effected it—you see that I speak to you as a rational being, which you were not yesterday morning.” Honoria sobbed. “I fear I was not, doctor. Those terrible sights and sounds—” “Stop, Honoria! No more nervous tremors—no more shuddering. Listen to me, and the last remains of your fright will disappear.” The girl raised her head and gazed at him with deep earnestness. “Let us divide the phenomena, or supposed phenomena, into four parts,” said Dr. Vandyke, coolly. “You hear a low breathing from the bed in your chamber; the eyes of a picture make you afraid; a shadowy dagger strikes at your night - dress; and some nameless thing leaps on your shoulders. Is that all?” “Yes, doctor,” was the reply, in a low and nervous voice. “Well, now, for elucidation of these terrible phenomena,” said the physician. “You repaired to your chamber on the night of the performance of this absurd dumb-cake ceremony, in a high state of nervous excitement, consequent upon terror at the storm through which you had passed, and superstitious fear. Well, the first thing you hear is a mysterious breathing from your bed—then a picture stares at you—then an arm wields a poniard. Let us stop there for the present, and let me ask you if you now doubt the real character of those phenomena? The breathing from the bed was the wind, or a dog, or a cat, or —nothing! The eyes of the portrait looked at you, as the eyes of all good portraits look at all persons, whatever position is taken up, either to the right, to the left, or in front. Lastly, the gigantic and frightful arm, grasping the dagger, seen when you were half asleep, and half conscious, was simply the shadow of that bough of the oak yonder through the window, which shadow was cast by the moon, and waved, as the bough waved, in a manner so peculiarly terrifying that it produced brain-fever. So far you understand, do you not, my child?” “Yes, doctor,” came in a low tone from Honoria, “but—” “The horror! the frightful, nameless something—the nightmare, bugbear, call it what you will!” The doctor burst out laughing, in spite of Honoria's quick shudder. “That was the only real part of the whole phenomena,” said Dr. Vandyke, coolly. “The thing, or individual, rather, who leaped from that chair, as you saw me leap, was—Meta!” Honoria half rose, exclaiming: “Meta! doctor?” “Meta,” was the calm response, “who had hidden herself in this apartment to frighten you during the ordeal of the dumb-cake—who may or may not have uttered the low breathing from the bed —who certainly did spring upon your shoulders.” “O doctor! is it possible? It cannot be that Meta could have been so cruel—” “Meta is a lunatic, or nearly so,” was the calm reply, “and lunatics are both cunning and malevolent.” “But what motive could she have?” “To frighten you?” “Yes, doctor.” “Hatred arising from—jealousy.” “Jealousy!” Honoria gazed at Dr. Vandyke, as she uttered this word, with profound astonishment. “Yes, my child,” said the physician. “Listen. As soon as I entered this house, and ascertained the causes of your condition, I concentrated my whole mind upon the question — who was it that frightened you—not what? A human being must have caused you to fall with that piercing shriek; and the mystery was—what human being? No servant would have dared—no young lady friend have been so cruel. Thus the irresistible conclusion was, that some idiot, or other weak-minded person, must have been guilty of this act, and there was such a person in the family. So far, the chain of reasoning was perfect; but what motive could exist for the act of this girl, who was supposed to love you? Even with idiots there is a motive, and I questioned Lady Brand, the servants, and all, so closely that I discovered what I wished to know.” “The motive—O doctor what could it have been? Jealousy? Jealousy of me—!” “Precisely,” said Dr. Vandyke; “Meta happens to have fallen in love with a young gentleman named Edmund Innis; she knows that he loves you — there, the words are uttered!—she overheard, in the drawing-room, the whole discussion in regard to the dumb-cake, and she hid in this chamber behind the bed—watched you in your sleep—concealed herself in this chair — saw you rise—leaped on your shoulders gibbering as insane persons do, and, when you shrieked and fell, escaped from the apartment.” Honoria drew a long breath, and for some moments remained silent; at last she murmured: “How do you know this, doctor?” “From Edmund Innis, who is able to communicate by signs with the girl, and extracted the confession from her.” Honoria covered her face with her hands. She was quietly weeping. “It was cruel in Meta,” she murmured. “I thought she loved me too much to—” “To love young Master Edmund more?” said the doctor, with a smile. “No, Honoria; that passion exceeds in force all others—is as strong in Meta as in Edmund Innis, only he loves you.” Honoria's face was covered with blushes, but a happy smile shone through her tears. “At last!” said Dr. Vandyke, rising. “You are now well, my dear Honoria! let me call you dear. I call few so! You are well in body and mind, in heart as in brain. God watch over you, my child, and guard you from all danger, and give you this honest gentleman, Edmund Innis, to be your faithful husband! That is my prayer, Honoria, the prayer of the old dried-up physician who loved once a human being—your mother. Farewell now, Honoria!” And, stooping, the eccentric personage touched the girl's brow with his lips, left the apartment, and on the same evening set out on his return to the capital. His patient was cured.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">XXVII. BEFORE THE ASSEMBLY. Since the scenes which we have just described more than three months had passed. It was the depth of winter, and the city of Williamsburg, the capital of Virginia, residence of the viceroy, and centre of fashion for the time, was in all its glory. Before a mirror, in an upper apartment of a house near the governor's “palace,” as it was called, Honoria was standing one evening, busily arranging, in multitudinous braids and plaits, the dark locks of Meta, who half reclined, with a delighted expression of countenance, in a velvet arm-chair, gazing at herself in the low-swung mirror. Honoria, who stood behind the dark little beauty at her work, was clad in her dressing-gown; her hair was in disordered curls upon her shoulders, and her toilet was yet to be made. At a window near stood her sister Lou, in magnificent ball-costume—all lace, satin, jewels, and powder—erect, superb, turning her head from moment to moment to gaze at the pair in front of the mirror, and beating an impatient tattoo upon the windowpane. The last words of Dr. Vandyke to Lady Brand, on leaving “Rivanna,” after Honoria's convalescence, had been: “Madam, if you wish your daughter to regain her roses and lose the mortal pallor you see in her cheeks, take her away from Rivanna. Give her gayety, change of scene, distraction of some kind: what she now requires is forgetfulness.” Lady Brand had repeated these words to her husband, and that gentleman had responded—chin elevated, hand passing slowly and with dignity between his collar and his neck: “Hum! — ha! — gayety, distraction, change of scene? Well, madam, that comports with my own views. I have affairs of some importance to transact at Williamsburg, and design going thither. You and the young ladies may accompany me, and make a protracted stay if you desire to do so.” The affairs of importance were imaginary. Colonel Brand had long promised himself the luxury of exhibiting the beauty of his daughters in the viceregal capital; and, greatly alarmed by the now unmistakable attachment between Innis and Honoria, he had already determined to remove the young lady to new scenes, and, if possible, effect a match between her and some wealthy young scion of the seaboard. Dr. Vandyke's advice, therefore, coincided with his own views. No time was lost in making arrangements for spending the winter with his family in Williamsburg, whither Lady Brand decided to go. A house was procured and furnished; every article of comfort and luxury sent down; and, in due time, the old, lumbering chariot, drawn by its four horses, landed the colonel and his family at their “town mansion” in the capital. On the evening when we present the young ladies to the reader they were preparing for their first formal ball or “assembly”—to take place at the palace of his excellency. Or, rather, Miss Lou Brand had made her preparations, while Honoria, busy with Meta, had not begun her own. “For Heaven's sake, Honoria, make haste and have done with Meta!” exclaimed Miss Lou Brand, at last, out of all patience. “The chariot will be at the door in half an hour, and you'll not be dressed.” “That is time enough, sister,” said Honoria, with her habitual smile, full of sweetness, and a little sadness. “Time enough! Who ever heard of a young lady dressing for a ball in thirty minutes? Your hair alone will take an hour!” “If I choose to spend an hour arranging it, sister; but I shall not.” “But, begin—begin!” “Meta's hair is nearly done.” “Why in the world did you not leave it to one of the maids?” “Meta wished me to arrange it, sister, and you know how obstinate the poor child is when she takes a fancy.” “Yes, I do—hateful little creature!” said Miss Lou Brand, with emphasis. “We must make allowance for her infirmity, sister. She is very unfortunate, and has few pleasures. Something—I know not what—has made her attach great importance to this ball—to her appearance—” “Something!” exclaimed the elder beauty, with a satirical but not ill-natured laugh; Lou Brand was incapable of ill-nature. “`Something!' you know very well what that something is: Edmund Innis will be there, and Meta is— in love with his lordship, Mr. Wythe's worshipful law-student!” Honoria blushed, and Meta, as though she knew when Innis's name was pronounced, by the very movement of any one's lips in uttering his name, riveted her eyes with a dark and angry expression upon the elder young lady, who thereupon burst into a ringing laugh. “The world is full of finesse, secret motives, and things sans les cartes!” she cried. “Women, even girls like Meta, are eternally scheming! But, come, come, Honora!—I won't tell you that you too are blushing—ha, ha!—but I do tell you that, unless you commence your toilet, you'll not be at the ball.” “There, there, sister, I've done,” said Honoria, hurriedly. “At least, Meta, poor thing, is pleased; and, it is so good to make people happy, sister! I'll get ready in a moment.” And this remarkable young lady, who had forgotten her own hair, to fix a poor girl's, began energetically dressing. “No!” exclaimed Lou Brand, resolutely, “you shan't throw your things on in that way, Honoria! If you don't know it, I'll tell you, that you are going to be the belle of the assembly—the centre of all eyes; and I don't intend to have those hateful old dowagers in turbans, ranged, like sunflowers and hollyhocks gone to seed, along the wall, nodding and tittering behind their fans, and chattering to each other, and whispering: `Just see Miss Honoria Brand, the beauty! Did you ever see so frightful a toilet?' No!” And, sweeping toward Honoria, the energetic beauty threw down her pearl fan, took possession of her sister, and busily began dressing her hair, which, under the plastic fingers, soon rose in an exquisite tower of curls, brilliant, powdered, and interwoven with pearls. “Now your hair is something like! Where is your white satin?” To this abrupt question Honoria replied, rather timidly: “I thought of wearing my blue silk, sister.” “Your blue silk?” “Why not?” “Did anybody ever hear of such an idea? You are utterly absurd, Honoria! —at the governor's assembly!” “That does not impress me greatly; and you know I am not a bride, sister.” “You never will be, either, at this rate, madam! Your blue silk! You positively shall not!” “Well, have it your way, sister: the white satin let it be.” A maid quickly laid out the gorgeous costume upon a bed; the young lady's toilet was finished, and her sister, retreating a step, looked at her, with head sidewise, admiringly. Then she rushed at her, rearranged a curl, retied a bow of ribbon, slightly drew a fold of lace across one of the snowy shoulders, and exclaimed: “You really are a beauty, Honoria; and will have everybody looking at you!” Honoria blushed and smiled. What woman could listen to such an observation coldly? She gazed at herself in the glass, and then, as the thought came to her “He will see me,” her cheeks grew crimson. In a corner of the chamber, Meta, with her strange, crouching attitude, was watching her. Miss Lou Brand, who seemed to understand every thing and everybody, turned and looked at her, and quickly ran to her, and seized her arm. “Go on, you little wretch, and get into the coach—I hear it at the door!” she exclaimed. With which, Miss Lou Brand hustled Meta out of the room, and shut the door. “Now I feel more at my ease!” she exclaimed. “That hateful creature was standing there, glowering at you, dear, and thinking that Edmund Innis would see her, too! What a goose! He has no eyes for any one but you! And now stop blushing, and come on. Your blue silk? Absurd! The white satin! And you shall marry him, and be happy, and wear white as a bride yet, dear!—and I mean to dance at your wedding—and let myself be kissed, too, by—my brother Edmund!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">XXVIII. THE ASSEMBLY. All Williamsburg was in commotion. Through the frosty air of the clear winter night flashed chariots drawn by four-in-hands; gallant young beaux mounted upon prancing thorough-breds followed, and the capital was all joy, merriment, and uproar. Colonel Brand had selected the most opportune season for his visit to the city, and on this night the carnival culminated. Hitherto the days had been full of pleasure and enjoyment; balls, races, tea - drinkings, riding - excursions, and card-parties, had been the order of the day; but these were all thrown in the shade by the coming “assembly.” Colonel Brand's chariot stopped before the great gate of the governor's palace, in front of which a crowd of motley character had assembled to look at the richly-dressed beauties, as they descended from their vehicles; and up the broad walk, edged with Scottish lindens, from which were suspended colored lanterns to light the guests, the colonel and his family advanced, and entered the broad door. In the large apartment, adorned with full-length portraits of the king and queen, the crowd was already great, and it would be difficult to convey an idea of the brilliance of the spectacle. Silk, velvet, lace, and jewels, caught and threw back in dazzling splendor the light of the great chandeliers overhead, and the stately gentlemen and smiling beauties of an epoch famed for such, were mingled in one great crowd, rich-colored as the dream of some grand painter. Sonorous music rang; the buzz of conversation mingled with it; and in the centre of the apartment his smiling excellency the royal governor received and bowed low to his guests with his well-known urbanity and elegance. He was leaning on the arm of his confidential secretary, Lord Ruthven, who, pale, clad in a rich but sombre costume, and with his black hair only slightly powdered, surveyed the company with courteous but stately attention. Despite obvious efforts, however, Ruthven scarcely smiled; something plainly bore heavily on this man's heart. In fact, the melancholy young nobleman had never ceased to be haunted by his possessing thought, his mysterious dread. Remaining in Virginia only at the express and repeated request of the gov ernor, he had never lost the apprehension which rendered his life miserable; and, on this evening, resembled, in his black costume, with his dark eyes set in his pale face, a veritable “death's head at the feast.” Suddenly the governor felt a convulsive pressure upon his arm; and Lord Ruthven, who had grown as pale as a corpse, whispered in a low voice in his ear: “Who is she, my lord?” The governor turned and looked at the speaker. His eyes were distended, and his finger indicated a young lady who had just entered. “What ails you, Ruthven?” the governor said, in great astonishment. “Who is she?” repeated Ruthven, in the same tone. The governor followed the direction of the trembling finger, and said: “The young lady in white satin, with pearls in her hair?” “Yes, my lord.” “Miss Brand—the daughter of my friend Colonel Brand. Your solitary way of living alone accounts for your ignorance, my dear Ruthven.” “Brand! Brand!” murmured Ruthven, in a voice almost inaudible; “my father had a friend—a Colonel Brand.” “'Tis the same; and Miss Brand is a beauty, is she not? Nay, there are two beauties in the family. See! that tall damsel is also a daughter of the colonel. They are approaching. Here they are. Let me present you.” “No! no!” exclaimed the young nobleman, almost fiercely, “not for the universe — never! — that is—I mean — pardon me, my lord, I am not well to-night—and—another time—” The governor had not time to think of these singular words, or even to look at the speaker. Colonel Brand was within a few feet of him, accompanied by the ladies of his family, and it was utterly impossible for Ruthven to retire without obvious and gross discourtesy. With one hand, the governor, in fact, detained him, the other hand grasped Colonel Brand's, and the host cordially welcomed his guest, and was presented to the ladies. Ruthven was on the point of tearing himself away; his agitation was frightful, and he seemed to have lost all self-control. In the midst, however, of the sort of vertigo which had seized upon him, he heard the governor say: “Miss Brand, may I have the honor of presenting my friend Lord Ruthven?” The young nobleman bowed low, raised his hand to his breast, as though a sudden pain assailed him, uttered some hurried words, and, in spite of every effort of the governor to detain him, retired from the spot, and sought to leave the apartment. This, however, was no easy task. The crowd had become so dense that to make way through it was almost impossible. He found the way barred on every hand, could only move to and fro, borne like a leaf on the waves of silk and velvet, and a sudden movement of the mass almost made him lose his balance. In regaining it, he placed his foot on a young lady's train; the young lady moved at the same instant, and the consequence was that the satin train was rent nearly in twain. The instincts of the gentleman triumphed over the cruel agony of the individual, and Lord Ruthven, bowing low, exclaimed: “A thousand pardons, madam, for my awkwardness!” “It is nothing, sir!—do not annoy yourself—the crowd is so great—” And the beautiful eyes of Honoria were fixed upon Lord Ruthven's face—a smile upon the bright lips. As she looked at him, his own sombre glance met the young lady's, and he shuddered. Honoria had gathered up the torn skirt, thrown it over her snowy arm, and now repeated, in her frank and simple voice: “It is impossible to avoid these accidents, I assure you, my lord, in such crowded rooms, and this will not inconvenience me at all.” “But—in dancing—there is a minuet—” The words were forced from the lips by a tremendous effort. Honoria did not seem to observe the fact; her little red-heeled slipper was beating time delightedly to the stately music. “Oh, I shall dance, I assure you, in spite of it.” The die was cast. It was a fatal necessity, in accordance with the etiquette of the time, that Lord Ruthven should solicit the young lady's hand for the minuet. He did so in a voice which those who knew him would have scarce recognized as his own. Honoria made him a little courtesy of delighted assent, and in a moment they were dancing together in the stately menuet de la cour. It was fortunate that nearly all eyes were fixed upon the little “Brand beauty,” as Honoria began to be called; upon her fair face full of happy smiles bent toward her bosom in the low courtesy—the slender figure moving with exquisite grace—the beautiful eyes, dancing with youthful joy beneath the piled-up curls, the powder, and the interwoven pearls. The figure of the girl was sunshine incarnate —the figure of Ruthven in his dark dress, shadow. Innis, looking at them from a corner of the apartment—for he had returned to Williamsburg even after Colonel Brand's arrival, and was one of the guests on this night—Innis, gazing at them, not without some trouble in his frank face, felt a sort of shudder, in presence of the funereal partner of his idol. The stately minuet bowed itself through its splendid evolutions, and came to an end. Lord Ruthven stopped suddenly; remained as motionless as a figure of black marble for an instant, then, with a visible tremor of his nerves, offered Honoria his arm, and was lost again in the crowd. “The music of his excellency is admirable—you are fond of dancing—Miss Brand?” His voice had the same forced tones —tones almost convulsive. “Very fond, my lord,” said Honoria, wondering at the evident agitation of her companion. “And the gavotte—the reel—the latter, I think, is our own Scottish reel?” “We call it the Virginia reel already, and it is even a greater favorite than the minuet.” “It is natural that the ladies of Virginia then should prefer their own dance, Miss Brand. And you are a native of Virginia, I believe?” “Yes, indeed, my lord.” “You have never visited England— Scotland—I mean the Old World?” He looked at her with singular intensity as he spoke, and seemed to await her reply with very extraordinary agitation. “I have never been out of Virginia in my life, sir,” said Honoria, and, laughing with the frankness and simplicity which made her so charming, she added: “I should think you might know so, my lord, by my provincial air and appearance.” “By no means—Miss Brand is wholly mistaken. Your father, however, has visited the Old World—was a friend, I think, of my own father, the late Lord Ruthven. Then we two should be friends.” Why he uttered the words he could never understand. He did not mean them, for Ruthven had registered a solemn oath to leave the city of Williamsburg on the very next day. The interview lasted but a few moments longer. Suddenly Honoria said, with a little flutter in her voice, to some one: “I am very glad to see you!” And, raising his eyes, Ruthven saw, within three paces of him, Edmund Innis. The young man, who had bowed low over the little hand which Honoria held out to him, made a bow also to Lord Ruthven. “I am pleased to find that your lordship has recovered,” he said. Innis held the hand of Honoria still, as he spoke; and Ruthven gazed with an indescribable expression upon the graceful figures of the youth and maiden, as they were grouped thus under the brilliant chandelier. “Yes—many thanks, sir—yes, I have, I believe, recovered, and—you have returned to the capital, Mr. Innis?” “To prosecute my studies, my lord. I design becoming a counseller one of these days.” “May your lot be happy, sir,” Ruthven said, “though I shall not have the opportunity to witness your forensic triumphs. I shall return on the next vessel to Europe.” “Indeed, my lord!” “Yes, I am under the necessity of so doing.” Innis had offered Honoria his arm, Lord Ruthven having released the young lady. “Your lordship will not set out for Europe, I hope,” said Honoria, smiling, “without calling to see us—my father will be happy, I am sure, to see the son of his friend the late Lord Ruthven.” The young nobleman bowed low. Before he was aware of the words which he was uttering, he said: “I shall be very happy to pay my respects to Colonel Brand and yourself, Miss Brand.” With a second bow he was lost in the crowd, and ten minutes afterward he had left the ballroom, and gained his lodgings.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">XXIX. LINKS OF THE CHAIN. Fergus was in the chamber, silent, erect, and respectful. His master threw himself into a chair, and said, in a hoarse voice: “Fergus, I have seen the woman!” “The woman, my lord?” was the cool reply, “and what is she like?” “Like?—Good Heavens!—beautiful, very beautiful, and like — like — the spectre!” For some moments a deep silence reigned in the apartment. Lord Ruthven then said, in the same low, hoarse voice: “We go to-morrow!” “To Europe, my lord?” “Yes!” “Good, my lord.” “There is a vessel?” “I think so.” “Heaven grant it!” “And this time your lordship is determined really to go?” “Resolutely determined!” Fergus made a movement of his head, and began folding the articles of his master's wardrobe and laying them carefully in a huge trunk, in one corner of the apartment. For some moments Lord Ruthven remained perfectly silent, his breast heaving. “I tried to avoid her—to avoid making her acquaintance!” he muttered, “but Fate forced it upon me!” “Eh?” grunted Fergus, dryly, continuing to pack the trunk. “It happened as before in the case of—the man.” “Your lordship means young Mr. Innis?” “Yes. That was what is called an accident. This, too, was—an accident.” “Do you believe in accidents, my lord?” “No!” “Nor I. There are none.” “None, and yet to think that, despite every effort, I am thrown with—these people! Does it not seem strange?” “Every thing is strange in this world, my lord. But I am glad we are going.” “Yes, yes, we will go! Nothing shall withhold me. Cursed Fate that drives me! Oh, why, Fergus, am I not a poor common mortal like the rest of my kind? Why am I the exception, the anomaly, the one being denied all happiness?” “Your lordship speaks mysteriously. You would say—” Lord Ruthven was silent again and slowly his pale face flushed. “I mean,” he said, in a low tone, “that were I not Ruthven, and therefore accursed, I might — possibly — who knows?—find some solace, some happiness, in—” He stopped, and knit his brows. His eyes were fixed upon the floor. His face filled with blushes. “She is very beautiful!” he said, as though to himself. It is impossible to describe the expression of Fergus, as he listened to this unmistakable avowal. The old face assumed an air of scorn, of pity, of apprehension, of affection, wonderful to see. He stopped packing the trunk, and, looking at his master intently, said: “Is your lordship really going to-morrow? If not, 'twill be useless to continue these preparations.” “Going? Certainly I am going!” exclaimed Lord Ruthven, almost angrily; “what made you dream that I was not really going?” “I did not dream it, I thought it; and what made me think it was—experience!” said Fergus, coolly. “Experience! what do you mean?” “I mean, my lord, that you said you were going before—when you first saw the man—and you did not go!” “You know why I did not go—because I could not, and the man went away! And I will add that it is disagreeable to me to be thus catechised!” An angry scowl accompanied the words. Fergus stopped suddenly, and turned to his master with a strange mixture of offence and mortification upon his old weather-beaten face. Ruthven for a moment said nothing. His heavy breathing was audible in the silence. Suddenly he rose, went to Fergus, and seized his hand in his own— “Forgive me, Fergus—my poor, good Fergus! poor, since you have so unhappy, so wayward and unjust a master! Forgive me, old friend—I am mad, I think, to wound thus the only heart on earth that beats true to me! But I have been unnerved to-night—I scarce know what I say. That face! that smile!—the lips, the hair, all—they were the same, the very same, Fergus! There was no room for doubt—I have seen her, heard her— 'tis she! And listen, Fergus! I was fool enough to promise to call and pay her my respects. Do not sneer at your poor master! I was weak, but I will be strong. That promise binds me—I will see her for ten minutes, but first my passage will be taken to Europe—then I will go—I will go—I will leave this cursed soil, and, with the blessing of Heaven, will set my foot upon it no more!” “Heaven grant that your lordship may keep your vow!” “Oh, be not uneasy; I will keep it.” Fergus inclined his head. “Your lordship knows one thing— that, whether in Europe or Virginia, he possesses the heart of Fergus, who will live or die with him!” On the next morning, Fergus had made all his arrangements: packed all the trunks, paid all his master's accounts, and went to engage their passage in a vessel to sail that very night for England. A few moments before, his master had gone to pay his first and last visit to Colonel Brand and his family. In three or four hours Fergus came back. The vessel would not sail for four days. His master had not returned; he only reentered his lodgings toward midnight, having dined and spent the evening with Colonel Brand, who was greatly interested in the news from Scotland. Fergus shrugged his shoulders, and said nothing. When he announced the delay in the vessel's sailing, Ruthven said, simply, in an absent way: “'Tis well, Fergus.” “I thought to hear `'Tis ill!”' muttered the old servant; “and now, `'Tis well!”' Colonel Brand had requested Ruthven to call, before his departure, and receive some letters he designed writing to friends in Scotland. The young nobleman accordingly did so—on the very next day—and, as before, remained until late in the evening, conversing this time almost exclusively with Honoria. When he returned homeward, he might have been heard muttering: “And, if Fergus was right in his incredulity!—if I do not go!—'twould be frightful!—fearful! Does Fate drag me? Oh, but I will go!—I will go!—I swear it!” As Colonel Brand's letters were not written, it was necessary that Lord Ruthven should repeat his visit. He went thither on the next day—on the next— and, to come to the result, announced finally to Fergus, in a tone of voice impossible to convey to the reader, that he had changed his resolution: he would not sail for Europe. Fergus simply bowed his head, suppressing the groan which rose to his lips until his master left the room. Then he uttered a species of moan, and muttered: “Have mercy upon us, O Lord! but may I live and die with my poor master!” A month passed. Lord Ruthven and Fergus had never again alluded to the projected journey to Europe. The nobleman spent the greater part of his time in his chamber, motionless, in a sort of trance; only, from time to time, he looked, in a singular manner, over his shoulder, as though some frightful object haunted him. His private talks with Fergus had abruptly ceased. At times his eyes would meet those of the old servant, and a glance, full of gloomy meaning, would be exchanged between them. But the pale lips did not open. The old clansman only nodded, uttering deep sighs, intent upon one thing only now— implicit obedience to his chief. When a month had passed in this manner, Lord Ruthven, who had grown, if possible, paler and more haggard than before, said one morning to the old servant: “Fergus, order my coach.” Fergus bowed, and went to obey. “It has come at last!” he muttered. “The bonny bridegroom is going to his bridal!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">XXX. THE TWO RIVALS. A month,!—a moment, an age; an atom of time, an eternity! A month— in which the idler dawdles through the dull and colorless days, each flying, eventless, in the wake of each; in which, too, the good ship encircles one-half of the world! A month—in which existences fill with sunshine, or are sunk in shadow; in which hearts break, and griefs are assuaged; in which all things come to us, or all things leave us, making us happy or miserable, as the kind Father of all decrees! Fatal days and hours, in which the tide ebbs and flows! I know nothing more remorseless, more paralyzing to the reason, than this certainty of the uncertain—this ignorance of what a day may bring forth! This month, over which we have glided, brought Lord Ruthven as a suitor to the feet of Honoria Brand. In spite of every effort which the young nobleman made to tear himself away from her, he gravitated ever nearer, more and more surely; one by one his fears were dissipated, his resolutions undermined and overthrown. He had fallen passionately in love with the little “Brand beauty;” and on this morning was bent upon formally asking her hand of her father. Honoria and Innis had witnessed this misfortune with inexpressible agony. So far from becoming indifferent to Edmund, in consequence of the thousand gayeties and distractions which surrounded her, Honoria had felt her affection for the youth increase with every passing hour. With natures like that of this young girl, faith and constancy are instincts—trial only strengthens them; use brightens and tempers the metal, as fire tests gold. To have Lord Ruthven, therefore, appear as a suitor, was an inexpressible pain to her—to Innis it was almost paralysis. And, worst of all, he could do nothing. What could he do? For the youth, almost penniless, to aspire to the hand of the wealthy and beautiful young heiress, was, of itself, sufficiently presumptuous; but, to go to Colonel Brand and say: “I love Honoria, and, for that all-sufficient reason, ask you to refuse the proposed alliance with Lord Ruthven, and give her to me!”—that was little less than insanity. Pride was the master-passion of the colonel—the ambition of seeing his daughter make a great match; and now, when this match was offered, when Honoria could become my Lady Ruthven, the wife of a nobleman, Colonel Brand was to be expected to say, “My daughter cannot wed your lordship. I reserve her for a poor, obscure little cousin of ours!” The result was, that Innis was wretched, and Honoria was not happier. She, too, saw the fate coming — could find no ray of hope. All that these young hearts could do, in their unhappy situation, was to love each other more and more, comfort each other with expressions of hope in which they did not believe, and await the intervention of that good Providence which, watching over the sparrows, watches much more over pure hearts, loving and faithful to each other. On this morning, when we have heard Lord Ruthven order his coach, Innis and Honoria were conversing in the drawing-room; and the poor youth had spoken of the probable fate to befall them, with mingled pride, suffering, and courage. In the midst of their conversation, a chariot stopped before the door, a knock was heard, and the voice of Lord Ruthven asked for Colonel Brand. The servant was then heard replying that his master was not at home, whereupon Lord Ruthven asked for Miss Honoria, was informed that she was in, and entered the drawing-room. As his eyes fell upon the young lady and Innis, Ruthven turned visibly paler, and his agitation was obvious. He, nevertheless, advanced calmly into the apartment, bowed with cordial courtesy, and, offering his hand to Innis, said: “I have not had the pleasure of seeing you for some weeks, Mr. Innis.” Innis returned his salutation with calmness, and said: “My books have taken up my attention greatly, my lord; and then I fear you attach little pleasure to our meeting —the first time was unfortunate, and you doubtless owe me a grudge.” “For my fall? By no means, sir; and I do not regret it, since it gave me the pleasure of your acquaintance.” There was something sincere and courteous in the voice of Ruthven. His melancholy was ineradicable, but the new influence operating upon his character seemed to have made his disposi tion more frank and kindly. Innis bowed, and said: “Your lordship alludes with great courtesy to what I shall always lament.” And, having exchanged these polite commonplaces, the gentlemen sat down. Honoria's cheeks were burning, and she kept her eyes fixed upon the carpet, scarce raising them as she replied to the commonplace phrases of Lord Ruthven. That gentleman was much too well bred to appear to notice the evident constraint of the young lady's manner; and thus half an hour passed, at the end of which time Lord Ruthven rose, begged that Honoria would present his compliments to the family, bowed, first to the young lady, and then to Innis, and left the house. Innis resumed his seat, and for some time gazed in silence upon the floor. “There is no longer any room for doubt,” he said at length, with the calmness of despair. “To doubt, Edmund?” murmured the young girl, faintly. “In what character Lord Ruthven comes hither,” said Innis; “'tis as a suitor for your hand, Honoria.” Honoria covered her face with her hands and sobbed. The poor child had no words to reply—she knew that denial was vain. “Am I mistaken in so thinking?” said Innis. “You know this, as I do, do you not?” “Yes!” And a second sob followed the desparing monosyllable. “His suit will prosper. You will be —his wife, Honoria! Your father will never permit you to reject a nobleman of his high position! He is worthy of you, too—anger shall not make me unjust. But, worthy or unworthy, the die is cast!” “Oh, no! I will never, never consent!” sobbed the girl. “How can you resist?” said Innis, in despair. “Your father's will is strong enough to break down your own. He will disregard your opposition and declare that you know not what is best for you. In his eyes, you will be but a coy and romantic girl, unable to choose your destiny aright.” Honoria sobbed out, in a helpless voice: “O Edmund, Edmund, he cannot, will not, force me to so miserable a union. Lord Ruthven is a gentleman worthy of esteem; but to marry him would make me wretched, and I will tell papa so! He is not so hard, it may be, as you think him, Edmund. He loves me, and when I tell him that—I love you only—am yours, in the sight of Heaven—that I have no other heart—” The poor, faltering voice broke down. In a faint whisper she added: “Oh, he will not make me so wretched!” Innis shook his head. “You do not know what men are made of, my poor darling—they are very hard. The heart is very hard when the hair is gray, and the blood cold. They find excellent reasons, then, for separating young hearts—money, position, prudence, is the text of their discourse; and I know not if I should blame them— if, in Colonel Brand's situation, I should act otherwise.” “Oh, no!—do not speak so! I will never, never become Lady Ruthven!” The words seemed to pierce Innis like a weapon, coming thus from Honoria's lips, and his brows were suddenly knit. “Lady Ruthven! Are you so sure,” he said, groaning, “that the difference between plain Mrs. Edmund Innis and my Lady Ruthven will not have some influence on you even?” “Edmund,” she exclaimed, “this is cruel, very cruel in you! 'Tis unworthy of you to so wound a poor girl who is unhappy enough already!” “Yes, doubtless 'tis cruel, unworthy; but I am so wretched! How can I see my happiness, more than my life, at stake, and keep my senses? Maidens have lived who have shrunk under this sore temptation—who, when called upon to choose between a poor youth and a wealthy nobleman, have forgotten all but the splendor upon one side and the poverty on the other. But, God keep me from classing you with such, Honoria! I am as certain of your faith as I am of my own existence—I know that, if your hand be tied to this gentleman's by a mockery, your heart would not go with it—I know all that, Honoria; I trust you as I would trust an angel—but what is the result for me?—what can I do? All is dark before me!—I can do nothing—” Innis bowed his head, and, for a moment, no sound was heard but the sobs of Honoria. Suddenly Innis rose erect, and a glance at his face indicated that, in this single instant, he had come to a fixed resolution. “Listen, my poor, dear Honoria!— my only hope in life! A man can only fail. When he has done his best, and is crushed, he can still fall with honor, and with some solace in his misery! I will formally ask your father for his daughter's hand. Should he refuse, then—” The door opened as Innis was speaking, and Colonel Brand entered the apartment.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">XXXI. THE INTERVIEW. Colonel Brand was clad in full dress —embroidered coat, gold threaded waistcoat, velvet short-clothes, silk stockings, ruffles, and powder. His air was even more stately than when at Rivanna—his reception by the governor, and the successful début of his beautiful daughters, having, in no small degree, heightened his consequence in his own eyes. He bestowed a bow, full of stately politeness, upon Innis, and, passing his fingers, after his habitual fashion, between his neck and cravat, with a lofty air, said a few words to Honoria. The young lady replied in a trembling voice; and, finding that her self-possession was leaving her—that, if she remained longer, she would probably burst into tears —abruptly left the apartment. Colonel Brand followed her with his eyes—their expression indicating unmistakable astonishment. He turned suddenly to Innis with some hauteur, and found that the young man had resumed his seat, thus manifesting a plain intention not to take his departure. The hauteur was succeeded by a glance of cold surprise. The colonel sat down in a great arm-chair, and, settling his chin in his ample white cravat, looked at Innis with the air of one who says, “Well, sir, what have you to say to me?” The youth courageously returned the haughty glance of his companion—for wretchedness had quite dulled his nerves —and said: “I beg a few words with you, sir, upon a matter of great importance to me.” His voice was calm and measured— the tremor of the tones almost entirely imperceptible. “A matter of importance, sir?” said the colonel, coldly inclining his head; “I am at your service.” “I wish to ask your consent to my marriage with Honoria.” The words were quickly uttered, but they seemed to have upon Colonel Brand the effect of a blow. “Your marriage!—with Honoria!” he gasped, thrown completely from his balance, and losing all his self-possession. “With Honoria, sir.” “Are you mad, sir!” came, in the same gasp of utter astonishment, from the colonel. “What has put so crazy a thought into your mind, sir? It is an ut ter absurdity—a piece of madness! Your proposal is astounding, sir!—it shocks me beyond words!” Innis was silent. With a heightened color and a stern compression of the lips, he braced his strength against the coming storm. “Yes, sir! I use the proper word— your words shock me! Marriage—with my daughter — Honoria! Good Heavens!” “I had supposed that you had seen, perhaps, reason to anticipate this request, sir.” The colonel grew purple—anger began to take the place of astonishment. “That I had seen—seen reason? Yes sir, I have seen, as you have the goodness to word it, your very improper proceedings. But I had not dreamed, sir, that it would come to this—that I should coolly, calmly, without notice, be called upon to consent to the marriage of Miss Brand to a person like yourself—to one who—” “Stop, sir!” cried Innis suddenly, in a voice as haughty as the colonel, “at least spare me your insults; I am at least a gentleman, and you shall not be under the necessity of asking me out of your house. I will leave it!” As Innis spoke, the burning cheeks, the flaming eyes, the lips trembling with sudden ire at the tones of the colonel, showed that the blood of a haughty race in the veins of the youth had taken fire. “I am poor—nothing it may be, in your eyes—but I am a gentleman, as you are aware, sir, and, if I am to be insulted, this interview shall here terminate!” Innis rose, stern, cold, and erect—a statue of pride—and had made a step toward the door, when the voice of the other arrested him. “Sit down, sir,” said the colonel, in an agitated voice. “I have more to say to you, and it is far from my design to offer you any insult.” The eyes of Innis met those of Colonel Brand, and he read in the latter no longer the contemptuous expression which they had at first worn, rather a gloomy satisfaction at finding opposed to him one as proud and strong as himself, who would not consent to be crushed by a word and a look. “I repeat, sir,” said the colonel, “that I have no earthly intention of offering you offence—of insulting you. Insult you? No, sir. If, under the excitement of the moment—in consequence of this very sudden and unexpected proposition —I have forgotten the courtesies of good society, I beg that you will forgive it, sir, receiving my apologies. I trust that I am too well acquainted with the proprieties of life, and the respect due from one gentleman to another, to offer outrage to one bearing your name; but I repeat also, sir, and I wish to repeat it so plainly that there can be no misunderstanding, that the alliance which you do me the honor to propose is entirely out of the question.” Innis bowed with gloomy courtesy in response to these calmer words, and said: “I do not wish to discuss the subject —to interrogate you, sir; but before I terminate this interview, the last in all probability I shall ever have with you, may I beg you to inform me why my proposal for Honoria's hand is entirely out of the question?” The words as nearly confused Colonel Brand as it was possible for him to be confused. He had no answer ready. It is very easy to exclaim, storm, declare a thing absurd, but difficult sometimes to declare why it is absurd. Colonel Brand remained, therefore, for a moment entirely silent, and Innis, catching with the despair of a drowning man at this straw of hope, suddenly said, in his earnest and pathetic voice: “Why—I pray you, sir, to tell me— why is my marriage with Honoria im possible? I am a gentleman, her equal, poor, 'tis true, but I have talent, people say, and I love her dearly — with the fondest, the truest devotion—and would make her happy! Why, then is it so impossible? I do not ask you to have pity upon my suffering—that is not the tone of a man—but I love Honoria so truly! How shall I live without her!” This passionate cry of love and anguish, bursting through all the wrappings of ceremony, visibly touched the proud but not narrow or sterile mind of the colonel. He was silent, but slowly shook his head, uttering a sort of sigh. “My young friend,” he said at length, “this painful interview is quite useless, 'tis only a suffering to us both. You touch my feelings, but you do not shake my fixed resolve. I have said, and repeat, that your social status is not the question —a gentleman is a gentleman under all circumstances, whatever his condition; but your union with Honoria is none the less an impossibility. She is a mere child, and, although I do not say that her age is an insuperable obstacle. 'tis still a serious one. I believe, sir, that you are attached to your cousin. I will not for a single moment do you the gross injustice of believing, much less of saying, that mercenary motives control you. A vulgarian might offer you that insult, sir, and so be rid of your presence; but I, a Virginia gentleman, am incapable of so degrading myself. No, my poor young friend, I am perfectly well assured that you are far above so ignoble a calculation; the question is different, but I am none the less immovable. I regret that my words should cause you so much pain, but believe me, on an occasion like this, plain words are best. I cannot give you my daughter, Mr. Innis. Enough that I am compelled to refuse your request. For yourself personally, sir, I cherish both respect and regard. It is possible that I have not appeared to you a very cordial personage, but my manners are naturally reserved, and perhaps pride is one of my defects. If you have thought me without regard, even affection for you, you are mistaken. You will find this fancy dissipated in course of time, perhaps, and do me justice. Now, let us cease to speak upon this very painful subject. The present conversation need not make us strangers henceforth, but I would counsel you as a friend to avoid as far as possible occasions that will serve to nourish a hopeless attachment. I must leave you now, sir; let us part friends. I do not venture, sir, under the circumstances, to make offers to a gentleman of your rank, but, should the occasion present itself, I shall take the liberty of proving myself your friend, begging you not to take offence thereat, but to regard me as your very sincere well-wisher.” With these words the stately colonel rose, held out his hand to Innis, or rather took that of the youth in his own, pressed it cordially, and with a bow, left the apartment. Innis had scarcely returned the grasp of the colonel's hand. His head seemed turning. He slowly took his hat, and went, walking as it were in a dream, to the door, which opened and, closed behind him. The clash sent a pang to the lonely heart up-stairs—the girl who, in her chamber, lay sobbing as though her heart were breaking.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">XXXII. DR. VANDYKE'S DISCOVERY. Innis was going along Duke-of-Gloucester Street, walking like a somnambulist, wholly unconscious of the world around him, when suddenly he was arrested by a material obstacle: he had stumbled all at once against another somnambulist, as far away from the real world of Gloucester Street as himself. He raised his eyes, and saw that the obstacle was a human being, and this human being Dr. Vandyke. The eccentric physician was as strange a spectacle as ever. His squat and powerful form was arrayed as before in the long overcoat whose skirts beat his heels; his feet were encased in enormous buckled shoes, into which descended his old shrunken legs clad in splatter-dashes, and from under his wide hat flowed the long gray elf-locks, framing the thin face, with its sardonic lips, and piercing eyes burning like coals beneath the bushy gray eyebrows. “Well met, my young sir!” said Dr. Vandyke, whose countenance was full of joy; “you walk over old friends, it seems, without deigning to notice their existence.” “Your pardon, doctor,” said Innis in a low, hopeless voice; “I was thinking —did not see you—” “Thinking? — a villanous habit! — What has youth to do with thinking? Act! enjoy! and leave the rascally thinking to the graybeards!” There was a species of tonic in the rough, unceremonious voice—commonplace consolation would have disgusted Innis; this man's talk was a stimulant, making him lose sight of his woe. He nodded, therefore; unconsciously permitted the cut-off giant to link an arm in his own, and drag him along with him, and said: “So youth is the time of enjoyment, is it? And yet I am young, and I do not enjoy.” Dr. Vandyke looked sidewise at him. “You do not enjoy?” “I do not.” “A love-disappointment?” Innis groaned. “Let us not speak of it.” “So be it,” said Dr. Vandyke, “but suffering brings strength. True, I'd rather not have strength at that price, and go, even at my age, for enjoyment— which I have at last secured.” Innis looked at him, and simply nodded. “Ah! ah!” chuckled the physician, “you do not comprehend. You don't see how an old mummy like myself can enjoy. But I have discovered the elixir vitœ.” And Dr. Vandyke's face grew radiant with joy and pride. “The elixir vitœ?” said Innis. “I so style it, since it combats pain, suffering, perhaps death itself.” The young man gazed at the speaker in astonishment. “Your meaning, doctor?” “Come with me to my laboratory, and I will show you.” “To your laboratory?” “In the next street. You are disengaged?” “Yes.” “Come, then!” And with huge strides, his long great-coat flapping against his thin legs, Dr. Vandyke went onward, dragging Innis with him. “I have not seen you for some weeks now,” he said—“scarcely since my visit to Rivanna.” “I have lived much retired, engaged in study.” “One of the joys of life. And the Rivanna family are well? They have brought with them, I see, that strange child Meta, who played so tragic a part in the `dumb-cake' business. I saw her at his excellency's ball looking at you.” “She is with the family.” “And still insane?” “The word is strong, doctor. She is deaf, dumb, and weak in mind, from an accident—a fall from horseback which drove, it is supposed, a portion of bone into the brain.” “Ah? But why was no operation ever performed? I mean no surgical operation.” “The attempt was made, I believe, but the child struggled so violently that 'twas impossible.” An expression of extreme joy and triumph overspread the countenance of Dr. Vandyke. “I was not mistaken, then,” he muttered; “but for my grand discovery—” He stopped suddenly, and said: “When did you last see our friend Lord Ruthven?” “This morning.” The words were forced from the lips, and a suppressed groan came out with them. The marvellously acute ears of the physician caught the sound. “Enough—I know all now,” he muttered; “they are rivals for the love of my little patient, and it is Ruthven who will win.” Innis turned his gloomy eyes upon his companion. He had caught the word Ruthven. “You are speaking of his lordship?” he said. “Was I? Well, this soliloquizing is a bad habit. Ruthven, however, makes one think. Mad—mad as a March hare!” “Lord Ruthven?” “Himself. Do you doubt it? What else explains his fits and starts—his visions —his terrible look at times as he glances over his shoulder? He is mad—and yet as sane a man too as I ever encountered.” The doctor chuckled. “Science tells of such cases,” he said. “I had not thought thus of his lordship,” said Innis. “He is calm, courteous, an official of acknowledged efficiency, I am assured, and, if mad, mad on one subject only.” “You have hit it. There is one chamber in his brain full of cobwebs, but otherwise vacant—or, if not vacant, inhabited by spectres called Edmund Innis and Honoria Brand.” Innis started. “Your meaning, doctor?” “I saw him at the assembly when she entered, and his face wore the same look as on that day when he saw you first.” “Doctor, your penetration is frightful, terrible.” “Why not? 'Tis my trade—this diagnosis of body and mind. To dismiss Ruthven. He is a mystery still to me, despite my theories—and a mystery from which I anticipate something fearful. But here we are at my house. Come in. I will make you, first of all the world, partaker of my triumph!” Innis suffered himself to be led by the singular personage up the steps of the small house which we have described in the beginning of this history; a huge key opened the door; and, throwing open another door on the right, the doctor ushered his guest into his study, where a fire was burning—a yellow cat stretched on the rug before it. Dr. Vandyke's first proceeding was to pause and listen. “Good!” he then said, with an air of relief. “Snuffers, that venerable female, is reposing on her virtuous couch!—methinks I hear the noise of distant thunder, long reverberating, and unmistakably proceeding from her ancient nose! Sweet music!—dulcet harmony! Everybody, friend, is afraid of something or somebody—I am afraid of Snuffers! Her tongue is caustic, her head-dress a nightmare!—but I philosophize! Sit down, my guest; you are in domo mea, or rather tua. See, even Felina, my favorite, welcomes us—my cat—though her frontleg has sustained a compound fracture, doubtless the result of night-prowling and the encounter of dogs.” Felina from her rug uttered a low cry of pain or response. Dr. Vandyke enthroned himself in a great arm-chair; his thin legs spread out; his hands extended toward the blaze; his face joyful. “The moment approaches,” he said, “when the great arcanum is to be revealed to one of the elect! But I jest in an unseemly manner over so serious a topic. Let me speak gravely.” The eccentric countenance suddenly lost its joyful and careless expression. “I am about to exhibit before you, my young friend,” he said, “what will prove one of the greatest and most blessed discoveries which God has ever permitted the poor, narrow brain of humanity to reach. But first let me ask you what is the greatest of human ills?” “Despair,” said Innis, with an expression of immovable gloom. “Suffering, that is to say.” “Yes.” “Of the mind?” “Yes.” “You reply justly; and yet, my young friend, there is reason to question whether the capacity of suffering possessed by the body is not greater than that possessed by the mind. I say that there is a question—I assert positively nothing. But remember the warnings of the Holy Book. The `wrath to come,' is typified by fire—the continuous burning of the flesh, and the gnawing of a worm upon the vitals. Thus 'tis bodily pain that is held up as the chief woe—the utmost penalty.” “Yes, but—” “The soul, you would say, suffers remorse, despair, and these are worst of all. So let it be—let us only say, then, that bodily pain is terrible; that there is reason to doubt whether medicines affect the body as they affect the soul. You are in despair—well, a year afterward you are joyful. You love your wife, your child, your sweetheart, and— you forget them. Time, the great physician, has cured your mental malady, and yet time has not cured yonder victim of consumption, as it did not cure the leper.” Innis nodded. “I understand. You would say that there are many anodynes for the soul—fewer for the body.” “Yes! yes! yes!—Until yesterday.” “Until yesterday?” Dr. Vandyke seized the cat lying upon the rug. “Look at this animal,” he said. “She is in pain—is she not?” “Doubtless. Her leg is broken, and hanging down. When you only touch it, she utters a cry of suffering.” “Good!” And, filled again with his overflowing joy, Dr. Vandyke took a phial, uncorked it, poured some of the contents of a liquid which it contained upon his handkerchief, and applied it to the mouth of the animal. The liquid exhaled a penetrating odor, which seemed as repulsive to the cat as it was to Innis. But Dr. Vandyke continued to press the handkerchief upon the mouth of the animal; gradually its head drooped sidewise, and in a few minutes it exhibited every indication of death. “What now!” said the physician, whose face was radiant; “what is the condition of this animal?” “I should say that you had poisoned her, doctor—that she is dead.” “You shall see.” And, stretching the apparently inanimate form upon the table, Dr. Vandyke opened a drawer and took out a long, sharp instrument, whose point he tried upon his palm. “If she is dead,” he said, “there can be no harm in probing the wound which she had the misfortune to sustain during her late life—for the benefit of science! I may be called in by some wealthy dowager to set or amputate the leg of her pet Angola: then, my young friend, a knowledge of cat-anatomy may result in guineas.” The doctor raised the broken leg and felt it. “A bad compound fracture,” he said, “and scarce such as to admit of setting. She would die of it.” “Then the cat is not dead?” said Innis, absorbed in spite of himself in the singular proceeding of his companion. “Wait, and see.” And Dr. Vandyke carefully probed the wound, extracting some fragments of bone. The cat did not stir. “Useless,” he said; “the limb must be amputated.” And, returning the probe to its drawer, he took out an exceedingly sharp knife, a minute saw, and some thread. “Now, for the surgical operation,” he exclaimed. And, with a sure and rapid hand, he made a circular incision, dividing the flesh to the bone; sawed the bone asunder; threw away the remnant, gathered up and confined the bleeding arteries, and exclaimed— “The operation is over!” The cat had not moved a muscle, or uttered a sound indicating pain, or even consciousness. “What say you now?” cried Dr. Vandyke. “I say that it was useless to perform so skilful an operation upon a dead animal.” “Look!” At the same instant the body of the cat was agitated with a species of tremor; the eyes opened, and the animal looked at its master without indications of any pain. Innis gazed at the spectacle with profound astonishment, and then his eyes passed to the face of Dr. Vandyke. “I now understand your meaning,” he said; “you have discovered the antidote to pain. You are immortal!” “If some other human being does not secure the fame of my discovery. I have found what the most eminent "'Now for the surgical operation.'" p. 76. 505EAF. Image of a scary looking man with stringy gray hair, sunken face, and hooked nose, standing over a cat, which is laid out on its back on a table, with a scalpel in his hand about to make a cut. There are a variety of jars on the table and on the mantlepiece of a nearby fireplace and a book with metal clasps at his feet. In a chair to the right of the man sits an apathetic looking man. He is holding his tri-cornered hat in one hand, while the other holds up his head, as he stares up at the other man. doctors have been seeking for in vain.* * Though the discovery of the anæsthetic properties of ether three-quarters of a century before the first experiments of Wells and Morton, may seem too improbable even for fiction, yet it should be remembered that ether was known to the alchemists, and that the method of making it was described by Valerius Cordus in 1540. It is also to be considered that physicians long sought for some means of benumbing the nerves of sensation during surgical operations, and that in the last century their attention was particularly turned to ether, which Dr. Frobinius first brought into general notice by a paper in the “Philosophical Transactions” of 1780. There is, therefore, really no improbability in supposing that an able and inventive student of chemistry and medicine like Dr. Vandyke may have anticipated in his solitary researches the discovery of Morton, and that the memory of his success may have been lost in the confusion of the Revolution, which was then close at hand. Yes! a poor physician of the colonies has revolutionized medical science! For what I have here performed upon this poor animal may be performed with the same ease upon men and women! Pain under the surgeon's knife has had its day —the study of a lifetime is rewarded supremely by this blessed triumph! O humanity! — humanity, that perchance will never hear my name—I am your supreme benefactor — to me you owe statues!” A species of furious triumph possessed the eccentric personage. He gesticulated, strode about the room, and seemed wild with joy and triumph. Suddenly he stopped. “You now know, do you not, friend, why I asked you the condition of the young girl Meta?” “Of Meta, doctor?” “She has had a fall from horseback; it has paralyzed alike brain, and tongue, and hearing, for a fragment of bone has impinged upon the brain, and this little fragment has dethroned language, and reason, and education, since education is through the ear. This poor creature is thus a pagan and a lunatic. No operation can be performed, from the wild struggling with which she resists it. Well, see that small phial!—with one-fourth of its contents, I paralyze, in my turn, this rebellious bundle of nerves—I cut with the knife and saw into the child's very brain, and she feels no pain! I remove the obstacle to the action of her reason—she hears, speaks, thinks, is taught—I have performed—I, the poor worm—what the world calls a miracle; and have I not the right to demand my statue?” An hour afterward Innis was returning to his lodging, full of an astonishment which, for the moment, dissipated his misery; and Dr. Vandyke, on the same evening, was closeted with Lady Brand, and speaking of Meta. Leaving the sequel of the consultation to its proper place, we return to the main current of our narrative.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">XXXIII. THE RING. Another month had passed. It was one of those nights of winter when the world seems to have bid farewell forever to warmth and sunshine; when the wind groans drearily around the houses and through leafless trees, and the moon, drifting through long surges of black cloud, only adds with its funereal and flitting beams to the hopeless desolation of the face of the world. Innis traversed the deserted streets of Williamsburg, slowly advancing toward the residence of Honoria. He had been summoned by her, after a long separation caused by the serious illness of the young lady; he was ignorant of the object of this long - deferred interview; but something whispered to him that it had some connection with the continuous visits of Lord Ruthven, and the dreary expression of the pale and haggard face indicated the nature of his anticipations. He entered the house, not noticing that the old family servant, who opened the door, looked at him with deep commiseration. Honoria was seated alone, before the fire in the drawing-room, and a susceptible tremor agitated her frame as he entered. Innis started. The girl was no longer any thing but the shadow of herself. She was fearfully thin and pale, and the eyes, dim and sunken, were full of a strange apathy. With her long, flowing robe fitting but loosely now to her slender figure, she resembled a ghost. She was motionless, except that, from moment to moment, she turned backward and forward with her thin fingers a ring upon the third finger of her left hand. As Innis approached, she slowly turned her head and looked at him. The appearance of the haggard face, and the apathetic eyes surrounded by red rings, made him shudder. “I—sent for you,” she said, in a faint, low voice, with something dreary and hopeless in its accent; “I wished to see you—once at least—before—” The voice faltered and died away. “Before—my marriage,” she added, in a sort of whisper. Innis shook from head to foot, and drew a long breath through his set teeth. “Your marriage?” he said, convulsively. “My marriage.” The apathy had extended to the voice now. Honoria looked at him, and added: “Then you did not know that I was to be married?” The young man suddenly lost all self-command, and cried: “O my God! Honoria! Do not say that! Do not look at me so! I shall go mad!” “And I too, Edmund, if I am not so already.” The slow, measured accents had not changed; the young lady was evidently the victim of utter despair, and her nerves were paralyzed. “Do you think,” she went on, “that I too have had no reason to go mad? My father has betrothed me to Lord Ruthven, despite my tears, and prayers for mercy—only mercy! Nothing moves him. He acts for my good, he says. I will thank him some day—girls do not know their minds—another opportunity for so great a match may never again occur—I must abandon my school-girl fancies—I must marry this nobleman!” “You cannot—shall not?” Innis suddenly cried; “it would be monstrous!” “It will be monstrous.” “Will be!” “Yes.” “You will marry this man?” “I must!” Innis fell into a chair, covering his face with his hands. All his manhood had succumbed. “Oh, you cannot, you cannot!” he cried; “it will kill me!” “We shall then be together again,” came in a low, solemn voice from the girl. Innis raised his head and looked at her with fiery eyes, full of blinding tears. “Do you think,” said Honoria, slowly and calmly, “that I am stronger than you—that I can live through this degradation, this lie of promising love to him when I love — you — you only in this world? I have submitted to the will of my father, and have not sunk under my sufferings—I have been very ill, but have grown well again, as you see. Soon I shall be ill a second time, and then I shall not recover. Nor would I. Once I shrunk from death—now I long for it, and pray God to send it me, as His dearest blessing.” Innis fell upon his knees before her, seizing the poor, thin hands. “Oh, do not speak of death, my own Honoria!” he cried. “Live for me, your poor, poor Edmund!—refuse to sell yourself thus, in this hateful, this horrible union! Your father is cruel—leave him! Come with me, and be what you are in the sight of Heaven, my dear wife!” Honoria slowly shook her head. “Such unions are not happy. Obedience to parents is commanded by a greater power than any upon earth. Do not urge me, Edmund—there is no hope— no! Do not let us even speak of that! Death alone can free me from this frightful fate. I have sent for you, to tell you that I shall die soon—to say farewell— and—” With a convulsive movement, she drew the ring from her thin finger, held it out to Innis, and, turning away her head, whispered: “And to return you this.” The effort exhausted her strength, but unsealed the blessed fountain of tears. She burst into passionate sobs, let her face fall hopelessly upon the wet face of the youth at her feet, and exclaiming— “This is killing me, Edmund!” fainted in his arms. A quarter of an hour afterward, Honoria was in her chamber, clasped, almost lifeless, in the arms of her sister; and Innis was walking the street with wild and uncertain steps — a hopeless man in the dreary winter-night.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">XXXIV. PHIL CARY FINDS THE MOMENT. It was the morning succeeding this scene, full of passionate anguish. In the same chair which had been occupied by Honoria in the drawing-room, sat her sister Lou, bending down and weeping. “I cannot endure it! Oh, I cannot endure the thought!” she sobbed out. “It will kill Honoria! What is to become of us? Oh, what is to become of us?” The hands which had covered her beautiful face fell, and her eyes were seen bathed in tears which flowed silently down the flushed cheeks. She gazed for some moments fixedly upon the floor; uttered a moan; and, rising to the full height of her superb figure, leaned for support—for she felt weak and faint— against the carven wood-work of the tall mantel-piece. Such was her preoccupation that she did not hear the door open, or see a personage who stopped upon the threshold. “Oh, this place is hateful, hateful!” she exclaimed. “Why did we ever come hither, and Honoria meet this person? If I could only fly from this town—never to return! Oh, who will take me?” “I, Lou,” said a voice behind her, and turning quickly she saw Phil Cary, smiling, with a frank light in his blue eyes, standing in the door-way. “You!” she exclaimed; “I did not know that you were within a hundred miles, sir!” Phil Cary's face had been full of happy smiles. Now he blushed suddenly, and a gloomy expression replaced the sunshine. “So the capital has made you formal!” he said. “Formal!—me?” “You no longer call me Phil as at Rivanna—then you have forgotten me, or grown cold to me?” Miss Lou Brand blushed unmistakably in her turn. “Cold?—no! you are so unjust!— why should you think—!” There she stopped. There seemed little reason for so much embarrassment, or for such careful avoidance of her visitor's eye. What could be the matter with the witty and satirical Miss Brand? The young man became more and more gloomy; but it was easy to see that with this gloom mingled a passionate sentiment of some description. “I thought you would have met me with a little more cordiality, Lou,” he said. “But pardon me—doubtless 'tis disagreeable to you to have such liberties taken.” “Liberties!” murmured the young lady, carefully not looking at him. “The liberty of calling you by your old name. I will not further offend.” “Oh no! no!—do not call me otherwise; do not be formal with me, Philip.” A roseate flush spread itself over the beautiful face. “I am so unhappy!” she added, with a suppressed sob. “Very unhappy?” The impetuous youth drew the hand which he held in his own toward him. The owner did not seem to observe the circumstance, or the fact that her companion was gazing into her averted face with passionate tenderness. “Oh, yes, yes!” she murmured; “this town is hateful to me! Why should I conceal my feelings, or hide our family trouble from you? Honoria is to marry my Lord Ruthven!—think of it! He is odious to her—or, if not odious, indifferent — and she, you know, she loves Edmund with her very heart of hearts! Oh, 'tis frightful! Can Heaven smile upon a union so repulsive? To give the hand to one when the heart is another's—to be driven to a marriage from which you shrink with a shudder of disgust! And yet, 'tis fated to be thus — our father is immovable. Last night Edmund bade farewell forever to Honoria, and the poor, poor thing fainted in his arms—where she belongs—where she belongs!” And the warm-hearted girl burst into passionate tears. Before she was aware of it, she was sobbing upon her old playmate's shoulder; he was speaking to her in hurried, passionate words of love and comfort; and, a quarter of an hour afterward, the young man, in a moment, as it were, and ignorant almost how it came about, had avowed his own love, and was the girl's accepted lover. These things thus happen. — They had lived all their lives together, jested, laughed, teased each other daily — not knowing that, amid all that mirth and carelessness, they were gradually approaching the moment when they would love each other! This instant of passionate anguish had decided their destinies. The beautiful young girl was sobbing, suffering, looking around her for some one to comfort her, and Fate brought her playmate—loved more than she herself dreamed. He had spoken, and the throbbing hearts beat close, each pressed to each, in a long, lingering embrace. An hour afterward, Miss Lou Brand, blushing in an angelic manner, and smiling through her tears like an April morning, whispered, faintly: “But, your mother, Philip? She does not wish you to marry anybody, you know. Are you sure—do you think she will—have me?” The reply of Mr. Phil Cary to this question was of a peculiar character; but neither his words nor his actions will be here recorded. In due time he succeeded in expressing himself intelligibly, and informing the young lady that his excellent mother had been quite ill; that she longed for a daughter-in-law to cheer her loneliness; and he further assured his companion that Mrs. Cary had ended their last discussion by warmly urging her son to pay his addresses to Lou Brand. “Then—” The young lady uttered that single word, blushing radiantly as she did so, and glancing sidewise for the hundredth part of a second at her lover. “Don't, Philip!” came from her a moment afterward; and, as the description of this scene has proceeded to sufficient length, we now close the door, and discreetly retire.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">6 XXXV. A STRANGE COMFORTER. To return, for a moment, to the preceding night. Innis had walked the street wildly for an hour after his interview with Honoria. Then, without consciousness of the fact, he bent his way toward his lodgings, entered, ascended the narrow stairs, and found himself in his chamber, where the dying embers scarce revealed the outlines of the furniture. He fell into a seat, uttered a groan, and covered his face with his hands. “I was sure of it!” muttered a voice on the opposite side of the fireplace. “Who will say hereafter that penetration is not one of my qualities!” Innis started, and looked in the direction of the voice. “Oh, it's only your friend Vandyke,” said the eccentric, who was sprawled as usual in a capacious chair. “I have only been awaiting you an hour and a half. Your old servant told me where you had gone, and I knew what the result of your visit would be. So the bonny bird is going to flit from you at last?” “Spare me!” groaned Innis. “I am wellnigh heart-broken, and cannot speak of this.” “Let us speak of something else, then. Have you seen Meta?” “No.” “She is cured.” And the doctor kicked together the brands in the fireplace with his huge foot, and produced a blaze. “Let us talk a little by firelight—'tis the best to talk by,” he said, composedly. “Yes, Meta is cured.” “You have not performed—” “My operation? Yes. Three weeks since—without difficulty, without pain! —and the child is convalescent—more, sane! SANE! SANE—I tell you!” As he uttered the words, “sane, sane, sane,” Dr. Vandyke's voice rose steadily in loud and sonorous accents, until the latter word was nearly shouted aloud. “Yes, my young friend,” he added, “after our last interview I sought Colonel Brand and Lady Brand immediately —proposed to perform the operation— conquered their scruples—administered my elixir vitœ to the child—removed the fragment of bone thrust by her fall upon her brain; and now she smiles, hears, understands, and babbles! — babbles, I say, for speech slowly returns. But, it will return—nay, it has!—and you will find as much.” The words were uttered with a strange, wistful, mysterious significance. One would have said that this man was in possession of some secret which he longed to reveal, but was prevented by circumstances from disclosing. In a moment, Innis lost sight of his own misfortunes, thinking of Meta. “Cured—sane!” he said; “is it possible, sir? I confess I had no faith in any such miracle.” “There are no miracles,” said Dr. Vandyke, “save those of the Holy Scriptures. A miracle is the violation by the Supreme Law-giver of His own law—as when Lazarus rose at the command of the Son of God. Else the seasons, the course of the stars, the growth of the acorn, were miracles. Nor is this cure of a poor human being, under the sealpel, more of a miracle than these. The obstacle to the operation was there, and was removed. Science moves and acts under the fiat of the Supreme Power. The child is sane—she laughs and weeps, and I heard her praying!”—the words were uttered proudly, triumphantly — “and without pain!” added the physician. “Absolutely?” said Innis. “She did not move! When the operation was over, she murmured, in a low voice, `That is my oriole singing in the tree!”' Innis listened with astonishment. “And she speaks distinctly?” “Not perfectly. Long disuse of the lingual muscles is the only obstacle. And now that I have told you of Meta, tell me of yourself.” “I have naught to tell you, doctor,” said Innis, in a voice of utter despair. “Your words, a few moments since, indicated a knowledge of my most private affairs—of my very great distress—spare me, then, the grief of referring to it.” “So be it,” said he; “but will you receive advice from a very old man, who has suffered much?” “Advice?” “Counsel, based upon experience.” “Most willingly.” “Then I sum up my advice to you in a single word—wait.” “Wait, for what?” “For that which the future will bring forth. I do not say that it will bring forth happiness—it may produce misery. But—wait. Take no trouble on trust. The cloud is dark often when the sun is about to shine. There are no miracles, but there are strange events in the histories of human lives; and 'twas to say this that I came to-night, through cold and storm—and I was going to wait, if necessary until daylight, for your return.” Having uttered these mysterious words, the physician seized Innis's hand, squeezed it with the force of a giant, dashed his hat upon his head, and disappeared from the apartment.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">XXXVI. THE FAMILY IN CONCLAVE. Innis was seated before the fire in his chamber, on the second day after these scenes, gazing with dull and stupefied eyes into the blaze, when a knock came at his door, and the old butler of Colonel Brand entered, bowing respectfully. The young man returned his greeting, in a dreary way, and said: “Well, Robin?” “A note from master, Mas' Edmund.” And the old gray-haired servant went to a table, took a small waiter therefrom, deposited the note upon it, and respectfully presented it to Innis. He took it with a strange expression of mingled repugnance and surprise, and, tearing it open, read the following lines: “Sir: May I beg you to do me the honor to visit me at my house between the hour of noon and one o'clock to-day? An affair of a very extraordinary character renders your presence desirable, and I beg that you will not fail to be present at the hour named. “I have the honor to be “Your servant, “R. Brand. “To Edmund Innis, Esq., Gloster Street.” The young man read this note over twice, with indications of very great astonishment, and muttered, “An affair of an extraordinary character.” A slight movement made by old Robin recalled the fact of his presence. It was necessary to reply to the colonel's note; and Innis wrote a line to him, informing him that he would be present at the hour indicated. This note he handed to old Robin. That old colored gentleman—for gentleman Robin was in his character and feelings—carefully placed the missive in his pocket, fell back a step, and—waited. Innis looked at him. “You have something to say to me, Robin?” “I thought, Mas' Edmund,” said Robin, “you might have something to say to me.” “Yes, yes, I understand you, Robin! Thanks, thanks, my good friend. Your Miss Honoria—” “She is better to-day, sir.” Innis sighed deeply, and his head sank. His eyes were fixed upon the fire, his expression absent and dreamy, and, taking this as an indication that his presence was no longer desired, old Robin silently and respectfully left the apartment. The young man continued for some time lost in reverie. “What now!” he muttered at length. “Here is a mystery which at other times would certainly interest me! `An affair of an extraordinary character' — what may that be? That my Lord Ruthven is an impostor—I a changeling, and the true representative of the earldom? What means this most mysterious mystery? Ah! well—all speculation is idle, doubtless. I shall very soon see.” And, relapsing into reverie, the young man continued to gaze with his old expression into the blaze. At noon precisely, Innis presented himself at Colonel Brand's door, and had no necessity to ask for the master of the mansion, who stood upon the threshold of the great drawing-room, waiting to receive him. It was obvious, from the appearance of the colonel's face, that some surprising event had occurred. A sudden alteration had taken place in him. The countenance, ordinarily so flushed and rubicund with high living and rich wines, was pale and haggard; the air of proud, almost haughty politeness, not unmingled with condescension, had given place to a bearing full of absent-mindedness and gloom; the erect figure was bent; the shoulders stooped, and the unwonted negligence of the colonel's toilet betrayed the absorbing character of the thoughts which occupied him. Innis advanced with slow and measured steps, and made a low and ceremonious bow. “I have come in response to your request, this morning, sir,” he said, coldly. “I thank you, sir,” said the colonel, in a much-altered, and singularly faltering voice. He almost instantly recovered, however, his self-possession, and, with something of his old stateliness, bowed low, and said: “I pray you to come into the drawing-room, Mr. Innis. I desire to communicate to you a matter of very great importance.” The last words were uttered with a quick tremor, of which the colonel tried vainly to divest his voice. As he spoke, he stood ceremoniously aside, that Innis might precede him; and the young man, inclining slightly in response to this courtesy, entered the apartment. Near a table, on the right of the fireplace, sat Lady Brand, holding in her own the thin hand of Honoria, who, pale, anxious, and with eyes which never wandered from Innis, seemed occupied by some absorbing emotion. Within a few feet Lon Brand stood erect, her superb figure drawn up to its full height, her jewelled hand resting upon the carved back of an arm-chair, and in this chair reclined Meta, looking very white and much reduced, but with an unwonted expression of calmness and sweetness in her dark eyes, around which fell a few stray curls of her black hair. We have heard Dr. Vandyke explain to Innis the daring attempt made to restore Meta, and its perfectly successful result. It is unnecessary to dwell further upon the scene. The all-powerful anæsthetic had done its work, and plunged the child into coma—the rapid and unerring hand had removed the obstruction to reason—painlessly removed it even; and the human being, but lately a subtle, scheming, insane girl, tongue-tied, and deaf as dumb, was in possession of her reason, in possession of the power of hearing and of speaking— smiled, as those around her had not seen her smile for years, and thrilled with happiness when informed of this miracle wellnigh, which had restored to her the light of reason, and opened the blessed fountain of tears. As he slowly advanced into the apartment, Innis surveyed with a fixed glance the group near the fireplace, suppressing with difficulty his agitation at the sight of Honoria. As he drew near, the countenance of the young girl flushed slowly; her lips trembled, and her thin hand convulsively grasped the hand of Lady Brand, whose eyes were swimming in tears. Before Innis could speak, Colonel Brand advanced, and said in a voice which he vainly endeavored to control: “You will perceive, sir, that I have invited you to something which resembles a family consultation. You see here assembled all the members of my family, as it is my wish that all should be present and participate in this interview.” Innis bowed, but said nothing. He felt that his voice would fail him. Colonel Brand cleared his throat, and drew himself up with a painful assumption of dignity. “The object of this interview, sir, is to inform you of a very unexpected discovery.” A suppressed sigh from Lady Brand was heard as the colonel ended his sentence, and the sound seemed to irritate him. “I pray you do not permit any evidence of emotion, madam, to mingle with this strictly business consultation. You will perceive that I, madam, am not agitated in the least.” And Colonel Brand's voice shook. Innis looked at Lady Brand, and saw that she was nearly ready to sob. The spectacle broke down his haughty pride, and he exclaimed: “What is the occasion of this agitation, aunt? Speak! I am lost in won der at this scene. What is the occasion of your grief?” “It is not grief, sir!” said Colonel Brand, with hauteur. “What then?” said Innis. “Agitation — mere agitation, sir! Ladies do not understand business.” “The cause of this agitation, then, if it be agitation alone?” Innis spoke with vehemence, a vague excitement mastering him. “The reply is simple, sir,” said Colonel Brand. “Yesterday I and my family were persons of wealth and consequence —to-day we are stripped of all, and are penniless.” Innis looked at the speaker with stupefaction. “You speak in riddles, sir. I pray you will explain yourself.” “That is easy, sir. I am no longer the proprietor of Rivanna!” “Good Heavens!—and who—” “Is the owner of the estate? It is yourself, sir.” “I!” exclaimed Innis. “I the owner of Rivanna!” “Yes, sir; and I beg to say that I shall in no manner contest your claim. The entire estate will be surrendered to you, so soon as I shall have been able to secure shelter for my family.” Innis uttered no word of reply. His eyes were riveted upon the face of Colonel Brand with an expression of incredulous astonishment. “I shall be compelled, for a brief space, to remain a trespasser upon your property, sir,” said the colonel, in an agitated voice. “I shall proceed at once to collect my scattered resources, and shall be able, I trust, to secure a moderate provision for my household—an honorable support for them—the rest I leave to Providence.” “In Heaven's name, end this preface, sir, and explain what you mean!” exclaimed Innis. “It is easily explained,” muttered Colonel Brand. But there he stopped. “The explanation!” said Innis, gloomily. “So many things have occurred recently, sir, that I am proof against almost all emotion. You, nevertheless, excite my curiosity.” “Without further delay, then, you are, as I have said, the sole proprietor of the Rivanna estate. Your indulgence, sir! I did not think to betray this agitation, but the thought is bitter that Ellen—I mean Lady Brand—and my children—my dear children—” The haughty spirit broke down. The voice stuck in the throat. At the same moment a chariot was heard to stop before the door; the knocker rose and fell. “Lord Ruthven!” old Robin announced. “It is well!” muttered Colonel Brand; “the family party is now complete, and one explanation will suffice for everybody.” As he uttered these words, Lord Ruthven, who had paused for a moment in the hall to divest himself of his furs, entered the apartment, and saluted the assembled company with a profound and courtly inclination.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Sir: May I beg you to do me the honor to visit me at my house between the hour of noon and one o'clock to-day? An affair of a very extraordinary character renders your presence desirable, and I beg that you will not fail to be present at the hour named. “I have the honor to be “Your servant, “R. Brand. “To Edmund Innis, Esq., Gloster Street.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">XXXVII. THE EXPLANATION. Ruthven surveyed the gathering before him with unmistakable curiosity and astonishment; but, suppressing immediately all indications of surprise, said to Colonel Brand in his grave and courtly voice: “I received your note, sir, and trust that I have not compelled you to await me.” As he spoke he drew from his breast his watch, and added, after looking at it: “I am glad to find that I am punc tual, having just the hour mentioned in your note.” Colonel Brand bowed. “Strict punctuality was immaterial, my lord,” was his ceremonious reply; “and Mr. Innis, a necessary personage in this family meeting, has just arrived.” “Mr. Innis?” said Ruthven, turning his head. He spoke almost unconsciously, but was quickly aware of the unceremonious character of his words, and added: “I beg that Mr. Innis will pardon the apparent discourtesy of my question. I had forgotten that he is a close and valued member of your family, sir.” Colonel Brand inclined his head, preserving his cold, almost stiff air of ceremony. “It was absolutely necessary, as you will ere long become aware, that Mr. Innis should attend at this very painful interview,” he said, “and should have his part in what is to take place.” Ruthven again bowed, and said: “Certainly, sir; but may I venture to say that Lady Brand and Miss Brand appear unwell and agitated? Is their presence necessary?” “Absolutely necessary.” “Then this is a family consultation?” “A family meeting, at all events, my lord; and, though I shall speak for my wife and daughters, it is their own desire to be present when I do so.” “That terminates the discussion, sir; pray pardon the seeming intrusion of my advice. I had feared that a business discussion would perhaps embarrass or annoy the ladies. As it is not so, their presence is a satisfaction to me. I derive too much pleasure from the society of those toward whom I hope even to sustain more intimate relations.” Colonel Brand was silent. It was easy to see that he was greatly agitated. His face was pale, and his breathing labored. He looked around him, found that every one was waiting, and at length said: “I see that you expect me to speak, gentlemen, and I can no longer delay my very painful communication.—Lord Ruthven, yesterday I was a gentleman of large landed estate, living in affluence and luxury: to-day I am wellnigh penniless— nearly a beggar! A moment, my lord: your astonishment is natural, but I beg that you will withhold it until I have terminated my necessary explanation. I shall proceed to put yourself and Mr. Innis, who is equally ignorant, in possession of the facts, and inform you of the unexpected manner in which I became aware of the real situation of affairs.” The ladies had not moved. Lady Brand continued to hold Honoria's hand —her sister to lean composedly upon the back of Meta's chair. Innis and Ruthven alone exhibited curiosity and astonishment. “I shall address myself to you, my lord,” continued Colonel Brand, in an agitated voice, “as Mr. Innis is more or less familiar with the subject of which I shall speak. The estate of `Rivanna,' upon which I live, and which is justly regarded as one of the most princely in the colony, was formerly the property of Colonel Seaton, a gentleman of many accomplishments and very high character. He was never married, and, to dissipate his loneliness, he adopted two nieces, cousins, who were greatly beloved by him, and stood to him in the relation of children. Of these, it was supposed that the elder niece was the favorite; but, on the death of Colonel Seaton, it was ascertained that he had devised his estate of Rivanna to the younger, my wife, leaving an inconsiderable estate to the elder. The origin of this disproportion was never accurately ascertained. It could only be conjectured that the elder young lady, who was very impulsive and high-spirited, had had some misunderstanding with her uncle, and that he had punished her by bestowing the bulk of his property upon her cousin. Something was said of Colonel Seaton's disapproval of a preferred suitor of the elder young lady. But these points are not important. Colonel Seaton died, leaving Rivanna to his younger niece. The elder married Mr. Innis, of `Lodore,' and died, leaving an only child, Mr. Edmund Innis, now present. My marriage had taken place some months before, and, in right of my wife, I became the proprietor of the estate of Rivanna. This estate now passes to the representative of the elder niece of Colonel Seaton, Mr. Edmund Innis.” Colonel Brand turned, and bowed with formal ceremony to the young man, who gazed at him in silent astonishment, and seemed to regard the whole scene as a dream. “The ground of Mr. Innis's claim to the estate,” continued Colonel Brand, “or, rather, the title by which he holds it from this moment, is derived from a later will of Colonel Seaton's, only recently discovered by a member of my family. This will entirely annuls the first—is indisputable, and perfectly regular and formal—if it were not, the intent of the testator is so clearly expressed, in his own writing, that I should not oppose for a moment the effect of the instrument.” Innis let his head fall, and uttered a deep sigh. Then, a flash of the eye indicated that some sudden thought had passed through his mind. He said nothing, however, and Colonel Brand continued: “The will of Colonel Seaton was discovered in an extraordinary manner. During the last autumn, a party of young ladies, then on a visit to Rivanna, determined to indulge in the very absurd and superstitious ceremony of `eating the dumb-cake,' as it is called—some highly-objectionable mummery, connected with procuring buckets of water from a particular locality, looking into a mirror at midnight, and other folly. Not to dwell further upon this unfortunate incident than is necessary, Honoria was selected to undergo the trial. And this poor child”—he pointed, as he spoke, to Meta —“who had then the misfortune to labor under mental infirmity, determined to frighten her cousin. She accordingly went to Honoria's chamber, and—as she has revealed to us since her happy restoration to health—sought for a place of concealment. There were no closets, but in one corner stood an old linen-chest which had not been opened for years. The key had been long lost; but Meta, in her solitary explorations of garrets and dark closets, had discovered the key—a large and peculiar one—and succeeded in opening the chest, which she designed using as a hiding-place. This she, however, found to be impossible. The chest was filled with nondescript articles — old worn-out clothes, papers, and other things. She accordingly abandoned the idea of hiding there—took her place behind the curtains of the bed, and, on her cousin's entry, succeeded, in a manner it is needless to dwell upon, in very seriously and almost fatally frightening Honoria. Not further to dwell upon this very unpleasant incident — Meta, after her cousin's recovery, returned to pry into the chest, and carried off many articles to store away in private receptacles — among others, this paper” — Colonel Brand drew from his breast a folded document, yellow with age—“which, in some manner, became mixed up with the articles of her wardrobe when they were placed in a trunk to be brought to Williamsburg. Of the character of the paper, the poor child knew nothing, and it was only discovered by accident yesterday, when she at once declared whence it had come, Of the authenticity of the paper there can be no doubt. You may see for yourselves, gentlemen!” With marks of great agitation, the speaker unfolded the paper. “See—the last will and testament of Henry Seaton, of Rivanna, in the county of Albemarle, Esq.—written, I am informed by Lady Brand, in his own handwriting, signed, sealed, and attested by two witnesses, both dead, I am further informed, a number of years since, but whose writing could doubtless be identified. That is, however, of no importance, as the paper is in Colonel Seaton's handwriting. You will perceive the date— several months later than that of the will under which Lady Brand holds the estate. You will see, at a glance, that Colonel Seaton devises his entire landed estate to the elder of his nieces—the mother of the gentleman here present, Mr. Edmund Innis.” Colonel Brand, with a trembling hand, laid the paper on the table. “You will now understand, my lord,” he added, with an effort, “what I meant in saying that I and my family are beggared.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">XXXVIII. THE WILL. For some moments the silence of death reigned in the apartment. It was first broken by Ruthven, who had listened with profound attention, and now, when the narrative was finished, inclined his head with calm courtesy. “You have related a very singular history, sir,” he said, “and I have listened with attention and interest; but you will pardon me for saying that I do not see the necessity for my own presence upon this painful occasion.” “No necessity, my lord!” replied Colonel Brand. “Your pardon, in my turn, but I think it was absolutely incumbent upon me to request your presence.” “For what reason, sir?” “Simply in view of the relation which you sustained toward my family, as the accepted suitor of my daughter.” “The relation which I sustained, sir?” said Ruthven. “Did I hear aright?” “Yes, my lord,” returned Colonel Brand, with an obvious struggle to summon all his fortitude; “to-day that relation necessarily no longer exists.” “No longer exists!” “Assuredly not.” “May I beg you to explain this extraordinary observation, sir?” said Ruthven. “In Heaven's name, why should I not be still Miss Brand's accepted suitor?” “Because the engagement of my Lord Ruthven was to Miss Honoria Brand, the daughter of Colonel Brand, of Rivanna—therefore to the heiress of one of the amplest fortunes in Virginia—” “Well, well, sir!” The exclamation was almost impatient. “That was yesterday. To-day things are different. Your engagement was to a young lady of great possessions, not to a portionless girl. Therefore it terminates.” “Terminates? Do I hear aright, sir? Am I, then, a vulgar person without dignity or sentiments of honor? Did you really suppose that, in paying my addresses to Miss Brand, I was actuated by the desire of gain?” “No, my lord—but this is a painful subject; let us not further discuss it.” “Willingly, sir! The discussion is very far from agreeable to me. I have listened to the statement of your family affairs, sir, and appreciate the compliment paid me in making me a participant. That subject is now dismissed, and I may be permitted to pass to one more agreeable to myself. No change will take place, I trust, in the time fixed upon for my union with Miss Brand.” “No change!—the time! Impossible—this union is impossible, my lord! My daughter yesterday would have brought you a princely dower: to-day, she scarce possesses more than the clothing she wears!” Ruthven inclined his head. “'Tis sufficient dowry for Miss Brand,” he said. “Impossible, my lord!” Ruthven became almost irritated. “In the name of Heaven, sir!” he said, “what difference is there in the fact you state?” “I cannot—!” Ruthven grew cool and ceremonious suddenly. “Colonel Brand,” he said, “you are incapable of acting otherwise than as a gentleman, and observing your word. Well, I insist upon the performance of your promise—that you keep your plighted word!” “How can I?” exclaimed the agitated father, “the thing is not possible! I repeat, sir, that we are beggars—beggars!—and that my child is penniless! There are some promises which a gentleman should not be called upon to observe!—it violates every sentiment of my bosom to take advantage of your magnanimity, and yield. Once more, sir, we have nothing—absolutely nothing! And it is not, permit me to say, in accordance with my views of propriety —with my weakness of pride, if you choose — to permit a daughter of my house to leave her father's roof-tree like the child of a peasant; to go forth, naked and portionless, to the stranger.” Honoria and Innis had listened to this colloquy with an alternate hope and terror which cruelly agitated them. Hope, despair, every emotion, tore their hearts; and now all hung upon the reply of Ruthven. It came, and was uttered firmly and deliberately. “I have but one response to make to all you have said, sir: I hold you—rigidly—to the performance of your solemn promise—to your plighted word of honor.” The words were slow, measured, and fell one by one, as it were, from the compressed lips of the speaker. “My word of honor!” murmured Colonel Brand. “I mean your contract, if you prefer the word, sir, but `word of honor' is a stronger charm to conjure by, with persons of your character. You accepted me as your daughter's suitor; gave me your word that she should become Lady Ruthven. There all discussion ends, for you are a gentleman, and noblesse oblige.” Colonel Brand's head sank. “Well, have it as you will, my lord,” he said; “you have overcome me by this appeal to my honor. You demand the performance of my plighted word. I yield, and consent to your union with my daughter.—But, bear witness, all present, that I resisted this proposal to the last.” He turned toward Honoria, looking at her with deep melancholy. “Pride! pride!” he muttered, in an agitated voice; “how despotic is that sentiment! Would to God I had a portion for you, my child! my joy, my life, wellnigh! That you should go forth a penniless betrothed!—Bear with me, my lord! I am growing old, and prouder each day, I think! This is hard—hard! But all is over; Honoria is your own, my Lord Ruthven—her hand awaits you— but where she will thus await you when you come to claim her, I know not.” “Miss Brand will await my Lord Ruthven at Rivanna!” The words rang out, cold and measured, in the sudden silence. They were uttered by Innis, who advanced a step as he spoke; and now, taking the will of Colonel Seaton from the table, tore it in pieces. “As the representative of my mother, I am the legal owner of the estate of Rivanna,” he added. “This paper is the evidence of my right and title, and I choose to destroy it. My cousin will thus have a suitable portion on her marriage, and will await my Lord Ruthven in the home of her family.” The words were uttered in the same cold and deliberate tone, and Innis turned toward Lady Brand and Honoria. “I thank you for your goodness to me, aunt, and thank Heaven too, that I am able to make you this small and poor return for all your love and tenderness; for you have been like my own dear mother. But do not overvalue my act. For myself, I ask nothing; I care not for this property. I shall leave Virginia, and, as this is our last meeting, farewell. May God bless and keep you—and Honoria!” He turned toward the girl as he spoke, and his pale lips moved as though he wished to say something to her. But no words were heard. The agony of his soul had rendered the young man speechless, and he turned away and left the apartment. The actors in this singular scene remained silent and motionless. Upon the floor at Colonel Brand's feet, lay the fragments of the will which had fallen from the hands of Innis at the moment when he tore the document to pieces.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">XXXIX. RUTHVEN'S OATH. On the night succeeding these events, Lord Ruthven sat up until nearly daylight, writing. He was plainly not engaged upon an ordinary letter; the thin and nervous hand moved with painful deliberation over the paper; and the expression of Ruthven's face was that of a man who has bid farewell to his last hope on earth. This man was evidently the victim of some secret misery which blotted out all sunshine from his existence; his face was as pale as death, his lips like ashes; and from time to time he glanced over his shoulder with wild and startled eyes, as though he feared the presence of some terrible intruder. At last he threw down the pen. He had not written rapidly; rather slowly, painfully, with obvious effort and repugnance; and the sheets which he had covered with writing were not numerous. He reflected for an instant; raised and read over the sheets one by one; then folded them securely, sealed them, impressing his signet-ring deeply into the wax, and deposited the package in his breast. Ruthven then uttered a deep sigh, and, rising, looked around him. Fergus was seated in a corner of the great fireplace, nodding over the dying embers; for nothing could induce the old clansman, with his rigid views of respect and propriety, to retire to his own pallet until he had assisted his master in his toilet. Ruthven had quite forgotten his presence now; but, as he rose, Fergus stood up, and, in respectful silence, prepared to wait upon his lord. Ruthven motioned him to resume his seat, and said in a low voice: “I have written it down, Fergus.” “Written what, my lord?” was the calm reply. “The whole truth—” Fergus gazed intently at his master. “The truth?” he said. “Yes!” “The whole?” “Yes!” Fergus inclined his head, but said nothing. “Things may take the course that the devil would have them take,” said Ruthven, gloomily, “I know not—Fate drags us. But I do not wish to be regarded as a monster of blood. Hence all is here written—that all may be known.” “It is well, my lord.” “I had it again last night, as you know,” said Ruthven, in a low tone. “I supposed as much.” “You had the right.” “Naturally, my lord; inasmuch as your lordship sprang from your bed at midnight, caught up your sword, and when I grappled with you, and took steps that you should not harm yourself, your lordship made an attempt to put an end to me.” Ruthven groaned. “O Fergus! Fergus! how and when will this end?” he exclaimed. “Pardon your poor, miserable master, my old friend! Better, far better that I were insane, a diseased lunatic, than the wretched being that I am, sane as I may be!” Fergus did not reply. “Some day I shall kill you, Fergus— you, the most faithful of my blood, for you are of the very blood of Ruthven, Fergus!” The old man's face was lit up with pride and happiness, as he listened to these words, and, when he spoke, his voice showed that he was greatly moved. “Your lordship is very good, and makes your old clansman happy! They do say that my great-great-grandfather was fifth cousin on the mother's side, to your lordship's ancestor. But, doubtless 'tis folly for the clansman to compare himself with his lord—let us think of other matters.” “I can scarce think, to-night, my head is in a whirl, Fergus. I go on a dark and bloody path, whose end I know not.” “Why not stop, then?” “I cannot—I cannot!” Fergus replied with the eternal movement of his head, that said: “I am the clansman, you my chief—I obey.” “You say to me `Stop,' but to stop is impossible now, even had I the power over my own will! The betrothal has taken place in regular form; the word of Ruthven is pledged, and cannot be recalled—and more, more—if more binding reason could exist—you know what I would say; I love this girl! love her with all the power of my being, and— will dare the worst!” “So be it, my lord,” said Fergus, coolly raking the brands together; “it is unfortunate but fatal, you say.” “Yes, fatal, awful!” A long silence followed these words. Ruthven broke it by a groan. “Oh, no, no!” he exclaimed. “I cannot, I will not believe it! I will not be ensnared so horribly, even though the devil set the trap!” “He is a good hand at snares and traps, this same devil, my lord.” “Speak not of it—!” “I obey your lordship—'tis well your order came in time.” “You were about to say—” “Your lordship bids me be silent.” “Speak!” “I would say that you have been duly warned.” “Yes, yes!” “You have seen both the man and the woman; things are advancing as they were doomed to advance; your lordship has told me all—” “No, not all! I have not told you what I saw last night!” said Ruthven, in a horror-struck whisper, which thrilled through the old clansman. “Last night?” he said, fixing his eyes upon his master. “What was that?” “I saw the actual spot—the whole— nothing was left out!” Fergus became slightly pale, but said, in a cool voice: “And yet, after this, you do not give up the affair?” Fergus nodded only, and this indifference seemed almost to enrage his master. “Your coldness drives me mad nearly!” he cried through his set teeth; “you do not understand, then, that I am on the brink of an awful precipice!” And, as though he had not intended to utter these particular words — as though they had forced themselves from his lips without an act of the will, Lord Ruthven started, shuddered convulsively, and turned so pale that he seemed about to faint. “My lord,” said Fergus, “I have but one reply to make to all this; but, as I have already frequently made that reply, I shall not trouble you with it again.” “Speak! speak!” “Well, I say again, my lord, `Give up this affair, and let us go back to Scotland.”' “I cannot!” “An answer which your lordship has before made; so be it. I see no advantage in further discussion at this hour of the night.” “A last word, Fergus—listen.” “I listen, my lord.” Lord Ruthven's feverish excitement all at once disappeared, and he now said, with a strange pathos and earnestness: “Fergus, my faithful friend, and foster-brother, you at least must not misapprehend me, and execrate my memory. Listen, then. Despite the Evil One and all his spirits, I will steel myself against temptation, and rather plunge that poniard yonder into my heart than become the tool of Satan! I cannot draw back now and return to Europe; my honor and my love both draw me on; but I would here, upon the threshold, without a tremor of the nerve, put an end to my own existence, if I thought I should yield in this frightful drama. Death—a thousand deaths first! I swear I will crush this fate!—I have resolved, Fergus, even to resort to self-destruction first! Living or dying thus, my faithful Fergus must love, not curse, my memory!” Ruthven held out his hand to Fergus, who bent over it and pressed it to his trembling lips. As the lips touched it, the young nobleman felt a hot tear fall upon his hand. “In life and death I am your clansman—it is you who are the chief!” And, as he uttered these low words, the old man's heart melted, and he sobbed aloud.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">XL. THE HEART OF A CHILD. There has survived the tempest of these events which we are recording, a little MS. volume in which Meta, the orphan, wrote down her whole life. Many pages of this book are painful; many full of a strange pathos. It is a record of the child's inner life, of her struggles, pangs, happinesses, and unhappinesses, naive, eloquent, moving—but sacred for its very candor and unreserve. From this record the following leaf is taken, as necessary to the comprehension of our history, which deals less with Meta than with others. It was written, as the reader will perceive, immediately after her restoration to reason, and clearly paints her life and feelings at the moment: “After a long sleep, I seem to have awakened, as it were—no longer a poor, insane human creature, but, as mamma taught me to read in the Holy Book, `clothed, and in my right mind.' “I have lived for years, I think, in a sort of dream-life, like twilight when the sun has gone down; and the world around me now seems so strange, and so sad! Naught surrounds me but unhappiness—and, O me, he is the unhappiest of all! Shall I write of him—and of—myself? I scarce dare place this feeling upon paper, but why should I not? It was, and is, only love—the fond, simple love of a poor child that I felt for him—Edmund. I write the name, Edmund, with a throb of the heart; but, 'tis written, and gives me strength to go on. I loved him very, very much, and love him as dearly now: but, no longer to watch him, and scheme to make him unhappy. Oh, no, no! I would give my life for him—my poor, worthless life, which I think will not last long. I think I could die happy, telling him, `'Tis for your happiness I die!' “I must not write down these exclamations, but remember what has happened, rather than what I have felt. At Rivanna, I was very, very vile—I was nearly the death of my dearly-loved Honoria, by frightening her so; and I then acted from a base, wretched jealousy of her. I was so vile that I could have killed her to separate her and him! Now, all is changed. It may be even that I shall bring him happiness. By my act, he is no longer a poor, penniless boy, but the lord of Rivanna. “This came about so strangely! In the old chest, where I tried to hide that night, I found many things which I hid away, and, among others, a paper which became mixed with my clothes, and was so brought to the capital. Before I knew any thing of this, came that strange change in my whole life—the removal, by Dr. Vandyke, my dear, good friend, of the cause of my insanity. I remember nothing of that, save a strange, dull feeling, a sinking, and an awakening, to find my reason, and my power of hearing and speaking, all restored. Of my rapture I cannot speak. It was like entering a new world, and I recalled but dimly what had taken place in all those years, during which I was a poor, unreasoning, cunning, scheming lunatic. And it was just at this moment that, looking in my travelling-trunk one day, I chanced to discover the paper taken from the old chest, and remembered where I had found it. I read it with wonder, and scarcely understanding it at first, but soon its great importance was plain to me. I had heard vague rumors of another will of Colonel Seaton's, and, now, here was this will, leaving all his property to Edmund's mother! “I held the paper in my hand, gazing at it with a fixed look, and thinking. To think was almost a pain to me, but gradually I linked one thought to another, and said to myself: `This paper, which makes Edmund wealthy, gives him Honoria. Her father would never consent to Honoria's marriage with a penniless youth; but, if the youth be a rich suitor, the master of Rivanna, he will consent!' That thought dazzled me, and made me wretched. Then he and Honoria would be happy—I should be wretched! In my hand I held their future life—it would be I who would give her to him! I shook, and felt the evil spirit tempting me. To burn the paper would be as easy as to produce it. Why not burn it? “I looked at the paper for a little while, and then fell on my knees, and prayed for strength to resist temptation; and got up, and ran to dear aunt, and cried: `Here it is!—here it is! Take it—take it!' She looked at me in great surprise, and wished me to tell her where I had gotten the paper; but I burst out crying, and for a long time went on sobbing, as she clasped me in her dear arms. Then I told her, and she hurriedly called Uncle Brand, who came quickly, and read the paper, turning very pale as he did so. When he had read it in silence, and turned it over, and examined it, he groaned, and said: `This beggars us; but there is but one thing to be done. Rivanna is not ours, but his; and must be surrendered to him.' He then questioned me, and I told him of the discovery of the paper, when he knit his brows, but said no more, and left the room, carrying the paper with him. A painful scene followed this. I was led by aunt one morning into the drawing-room, and Edmund and Lord Ruthven soon came, and Uncle Brand spoke of the will. Edmund tore it in pieces, and left the room — Lord Ruthven having claimed, as he said, Uncle Brand's `plighted word of honor' that he should marry Cousin Honoria. “Poor, poor, Honoria! There is no hope for her or for him—Edmund! Uncle Brand is not to be moved, and Honoria and Lord Ruthven will surely be married. I do not rejoice at it—oh, no —no! My heart bleeds to think of his unhappiness—of how much he will suffer. Why, oh, why do such things happen in this world? Why should his heart be broken when he loves Honoria so—and all that she may marry a lord? What is a lord? Is he better than a gentleman? Compare Edmund and Lord Ruthven, and who shall say that Edmund is not the better worth loving? But there is no hope for him. Uncle Brand would rather die, and have his daughter made miserable, than break his `word' when he has once given it. I heard him say as much, but I do not think that he understands or believes she will be unhappy. He has said to aunt, more than once, in my hearing: `Pshaw! —this fancy for her cousin is nothing. Lady Ruthven will soon be consoled; women are fickle!' Are they? I know not how it may be with others: but one poor, weak girl—a girl, not a woman— would die if she could buy thus the happiness of one she has loved long, and dearly, and faithfully! “I am not well to-day. Exposure in a thin dress at the great assembly, at the governor's palace, has given me what aunt calls `a cold,' and a sharp pang strikes through my breast at times. I feel so weak; but all is in God's hands. He knows what is best for me. My life is not sunshine that I should cling to it, and I see little happiness for me in the future. And, yet, I do not repine. He can never love me; but I can love him, and pray for him, and think night and day of him. Oh, may he be happier, and forget this misery, and be a good man, and think sometimes, when I am gone, of his poor Meta!—” Tears had fallen on the page which held this confession. You might see the blots. On the next leaf was written: “We leave Williamsburg to-morrow. I have told no one, but I think I am going to be ill—and that I shall not see the spring flowers. God's will be done! I have seen him no more. I think he has left the capital—my poor Edmund!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">XLI. THE RETURN. When it was announced that “the Brand beauty” and her almost equally lovely sister were about to leave the capital in the height of the fashionable season, a great sensation took place among the gallants of that gallant epoch. Honoria had partially enslaved more than one “fine gentleman” of the place and time; and these now uttered piteous sighs at her intended departure; wrote verses in her honor; and were incessant in their attempts to obtain speech of her, and bid her farewell. The young lady, however, resolutely denied herself to all visitors; remained in her chamber like an invalid, and even sent her excuses to Lord Ruthven when he came, the accepted suitor being placed on the same footing as the rest. When at last the great chariot rolled up to the door one bright winter morning, and Honoria made her appearance, clad in her travelling-dress, her admirers, who had received notice of the intended “flitting,” obtained a last view of her, and followed her to the very door of the chariot. All wondered at her pale face, and the apathetic eyes in which dwelt a settled sadness. They felt that a portion of the beauty and splendor of the capital was leaving it; but this splendor was evidently under a cloud—the sunshine was dimmed—and, above all, they no longer had any hope, having ascertained Honoria's formal betrothal to Lord Ruthven, who assisted her into the chariot. They therefore kissed their hands, uttered a few gallant speeches, wished their lady-love a pleasant journey, and went to court some other dulcinea, and celebrate her in love-verses in the poet's corner of the Virginia Gazette. So Honoria rolled away from Williamsburg, and out of that splendid society—forgotten. She did not regret it. Sinking back in a seat, beside her sister, and opposite her father and mother, she covered her face with a scarf, and was soon lost in the dangerous land of reverie. It is needless to say that she was thinking of one person only, Edmund Innis. He had left Williamsburg some time before, without even giving his friend Phil Cary an opportunity to see him. For the rest, it is doubtful if Mr. Philip Cary, riding now beside the coach, Miss Lou Brand's accepted suitor, had thoughts for any human being except the queenly girl with whom, as he gallantly caracoled at the window, he exchanged those glances which are the joy of youth and love, and which we elders laugh at and regret so. Beside her sister, who was all happiness, Honoria was the spirit of sadness. Her life had suddenly changed on the day when her father had announced his will. From that moment she had shrunk from the brilliant scenes in which she had shone with a nervous terror and disgust. All that splendor had grown dull and dreary; she lived in a sort of dream; and a strange apathy had seized upon her, paralyzing all her faculties. She had but one sentiment now, besides her settled despair—it was a longing to be away from noise and bustle and prying eyes; from the scenes where she must speak, and reply to what was spoken; and, burying herself in her quiet chamber in the silent old walls of Rivanna, collect, if possible, her weary thoughts, and summon strength for the woful sacrifice which loomed up before her, like a coming fate. The old family chariot rolled slowly on its way toward the mountains, stopping each night at the house of some one of the gentry, Colonel Brand's friends—for, at that time, entertainment of travellers at the old Virginia country houses was regarded as a matter of course—and in due time the lumbering vehicle, drawn by its stalwart bays, entered the great gate of Rivanna, and ascended the hill, upon which stood the old mansion. As it passed beneath the great oak-trees, bare and spectral now, divested of their leaves, Honoria looked toward that particular tree, beneath whose wide boughs she and Innis had plighted their troth, and a pang, like an acute physical pain, passed through her heart. There his lips had pressed her own, and she had leaned her cheek upon his breast, her innocent heart throbbing as she felt his arm encircle her in that long, pure, lingering embrace. There she had looked into his frank eyes and read the treasure of his love; had avowed her own in a murmur as low and soft as the whisper of the wind in the leaves—all that scene, gone now so long into the past, rose up again before her, and made her wretched. He had left her!—she was betrothed to another! The sunshine and music and singing-birds had gone out of her life— the great oak was bare and forbidding, no longer musical with song and laughter; and the change was a type of that which had taken place in her own fate. She turned away her eyes, uttered a sob which she could not suppress, and soon afterward was in her chamber, weeping as though her very heart were breaking. She had promised herself comfort and calmness, when once back to her old home; and now every object, like the weird oak, reminded her of her past happiness, and made her wretched. There was the wide hall where she and Edmund had so often walked up and down in happy talk; the drawing-room, where so many sunny hours had fled away in his society; her mother's chamber, where it had been his habit to repair regularly as soon as he entered the mansion, and where the great chair by the fireplace seemed still to retain the impress of his form: these, and a hundred other parts of the house, still spoke of him, recalling him to mind; and Honoria was plunged into a despair greater than any which she had yet experienced. She felt now the full extent of what she had lost; and when at last she threw herself upon her bed at night, in a fit of passionate weeping, she felt that death would be a relief from her agony. But the strong hours march, regardless of joy and woe. Honoria fell from despair into a sombre apathy. She scarcely ever left her chamber, and seldom uttered more than a few commonplace words in response to what was said to her. She seemed to be looking forward with a sort of terror to the day—but a few weeks off now—when Lord Ruthven would appear at Rivanna, and claim her hand. When that thought came to her, she shuddered, and felt faint.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">XLII. THE SEARCH FOR INNIS. Rivanna, in the gloomy days of that winter, was a sad place; and the very servants went about in silence, treading warily, as though fearful of arousing echoes in the dreary mansion. Colonel Brand remained shut up almost constantly in his library, and had few words for anybody. Lady Brand, subjugated by the imperious will of her husband—a person whom she had rather feared than loved from the day of their marriage—said nothing, uttered no remonstrance, but seemed to grow sadder and older day by day; and Meta, who spent most of her time upon a couch, breathing with difficulty, was often surprised shedding tears. The only member of the family who preserved even the semblance of a sad cheerfulness was Lou Brand, whose buoyant disposition enabled her to combat in some slight degree the general tendency to gloom. Phil Cary was at Rivanna almost daily—for he was the formally-acknowledged affiancé of the young lady; and they talked interminably of the sad state of things. One day Lou Brand, after gazing for some moments into the fire, said: “Philip, you really must find where Edmund is, and why we never hear of or from him.” “You then wish me to try again?” “Oh, yes, yes!” “You know how unsuccessful I have been. As soon as I got back from Williamsburg, I lost no time in going to find him, knowing that he had ridden already away from the capital. I rode up the mountain to his house, and found doors, windows, shutters, all closed, and not even a servant. I tried a second time— knocked—shouted—no one came. Shall I make a third attempt?” “Yes; I must know something about him! Yesterday my poor Honoria asked me, in a low voice, what had become of him, and I could tell her nothing.” Phil Cary sighed deeply. “I will try once more, then,” he said, “but would to Heaven this sad tragedy were over!” “Would that it were! Rivanna, that was so cheerful once, is like a tomb. Meta is hopelessly ill, I fear, and I shall not be astonished to find her take to her bed at any instant. O me! what will become of us!” And the impulsive and warm-hearted girl burst into tears. She almost instantly dried her eyes, however, and said: “Why not go to-day?” “To-day? I shall lose so much of your society. You know I am compelled to go to Williamsburg on business to-morrow.” “The more reason, Philip, to relieve poor Honoria's mind. Try, for the last time, to see Edmund; it will make my poor sister happier to hear of him, and we can do nothing better in this sad world than to make somebody happier.” Phil Cary looked at the speaker with great tenderness, and exclaimed: “You are a dear, good girl, Lou! That anybody should regard you as careless and unthinking! I will go at once, and return before evening, if possible.” And, in ten minutes, the young man was on horseback, riding in the direction of the western mountains. It was a dreary, chilling landscape through which he passed. On the day before, a heavy snow had fallen, and the fields were one great shroud; the mountain evergreens weighed down with the masses of snow which had clung to them. The atmosphere, gray, hazy, and ominous, indicated another storm; and the wind, rising and falling fitfully, died away, in the dense masses of pine, in a sorrowful moan. Phil Cary pushed on through the deep snow, following the narrow road only by means of the opening in the firs, for no track was visible; and thus slowly and with difficulty ascended the mountain, amid whose gorges the wind, now grown keener, howled and groaned. But one living thing had met his gaze— an immense eagle, which rose, flapping his enormous wings, from a pine-tree, as the rider approached, to wing his way deeper into the solitary fastnesses. An hour's ride brought the young man at last in sight of Innis's small house in a gash of the mountain. No smoke rose from the chimney; no sign of habitation was visible. He dismounted, knocked, received no reply, then he 7 shouted; still no reply came; and at the end of half an hour the young man remounted his horse, and descended the mountain by the same path which he had pursued in ascending. He had uttered but two words as he turned away from the deserted house— “Poor Edmund!” At Rivanna distressing intelligence greeted him. Meta had been taken suddenly ill, and at one time Lady Brand, who had been hastily summoned, feared that she would die. When the young man reached the house, she was better; but such was Lady Brand's anxiety, that she requested Phil Cary, whose design of visiting the capital was known to her, to beg Dr. Vandyke to come, if possible, and see the child. “Nothing stops that very remarkable man, when he can relieve suffering,” said Lady Brand. “Beg him to come to me, Philip—I feel as though his presence would do good to us all. We are a sad, a very sad family, Philip!” And the kind lady hastened to the side of Meta. On the next morning Phil Cary set out for Williamsburg. Five days afterward, hour for hour from that evening, Dr. Vandyke got out of his carriage, and, entering the house, said: “Well, how is the child?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">XLIII. DR. VANDYKE'S DIAGNOSIS. Dr. Vandyke arrived toward nightfall, and was up with Meta until a late hour of the night. On the next morning he requested that his carriage might be ordered, as it was necessary that he should return to Williamsburg. Colonel Brand, of whom this request was made, protested with ceremonious courtesy against this sudden return; but the eccentric physician responded: “I have my sick to see to. I must go, but desire first some conversation with yourself, sir.” “Some conversation, sir?” repeated Colonel Brand. “In private.” “Willingly, sir.” And the colonel led the way to the library, closing the door behind them. Dr. Vandyke came to the point with his habitual directness. “Do you know that two members of your household are as good as dying?” he said. “Two members! — good Heavens, sir! You mean—” “Your daughter Honoria, and the child Meta.” Colonel Brand looked inexpressibly shocked; but, before he could reply, the physician continued in the same abrupt, matter-of-fact voice: “First, to speak of Meta. She `caught cold,' as fools say, at the governor's ball, where, after the mad fashion of young ladies in general, she went in a gossamer dress, and shoes as thin as paper—that is to say, her lungs, never strong, became diseased — the disease was not crushed in its infancy, as perhaps might have been done; and the consequence is, that the projected wedding of your daughter Honoria promises to be followed by a funeral.” “Your intelligence deeply distresses me!” exclaimed Colonel Brand. “I had not supposed—” “That things were so bad, you would say?” “I had not, sir.” “Well, I put you in possession of the exact state of the case.” Colonel Brand knit his brows. Suddenly he turned to the physician. “But—” he said. “You mean that Meta is not Miss Brand?” “You spoke also of Miss Brand, sir— made, if I understood you aright, a very surprising statement in regard to her.” “I did. I said that Honoria Brand was as good as dying—as bad, I should have said; for death, whatever fanciful people say, is bad, very bad—and not good in any sense.” “You astound me, sir! Honoria ill? I was aware that the dissipations of the capital, extremely late hours, and excitement, had—” “Colonel Brand,” said Dr. Vandyke. “Sir!” “Do you consider me a fool?” “A fool? Really, sir, this conversation, you will permit me to say, is assuming an unusual—a very unusual character!” “Because I speak to the point; and speaking to the point, I grant you, is unusual in this world of froth and circumloculation! I say that you either regard me as a ninny, or you wish to avoid hearing what I am going to tell you—since you know, as well as I know, that Honoria's condition is due in no measure whatever to either late hours, dissipation, or excitement in society.” “Indeed, sir,” said Colonel Brand, drawing himself up with some hauteur, “you are very good to take the trouble of informing yourself so profoundly upon the private affairs of my family.” “I have the right to do so.” “What right, sir?” “The right of a man who was once in love with your wife, and who swore to her when the last parting came—when she was about to marry—that if ever she were in trouble, and I could help her, I would speak out, caring for nothing, and be a friend to her!” The announcement seemed wellnigh to take away the stately colonel's breath. He gazed at the now fiery Dr. Vandyke, who was glaring at him fixedly, with a mixture of astonishment and hauteur wonderful to see. “You know now why I am meddling in your family affairs,” said the eccentric physician. “You call it meddling—well, I reply that meddling is—meddling: and I am simply affording you information— laying before you the result of a medical diagnosis, made last night, of your daughter's condition. Act as you please —it is no part of my business to try the pathetic. I tell you that Honoria Brand is the victim of what is called, in the mummery of society, a decline—that is to say, she is undermined by a slow fever which is going to kill her; and the fever is due, neither to dissipation, late hours, nor excitement, but to the prospect of marrying Lord Ruthven, when she loves her cousin, Edmund Innis.” The words were blurted out with little ceremony. Dr. Vandyke was, evidently, either too much in earnest to care for forms, or aimed, by the very rudeness of his address, to strike more heavily, and produce the desired effect. His words, indeed, seemed to impress Colonel Brand strangely. He turned red and then pale, his lip trembled slightly, and he cleared his throat twice before replaying. “Your very—ahem!—extraordinary communication,” he at length said, with affected coolness and ceremony, which his agitation belied, “leaves me at a loss, sir, how to reply. I am, then, to regard this communication as due to—” “My affection for Lady Brand? Yes. Let that be stated plainly. I was her suitor—a poor suitor. She married you. Well, I said nothing; did not make a fool of myself by falling into a rage. I said, `A woman chooses her own destiny—or has it chosen for her—I will be this one's friend in spite of all;' and I prove myself her friend by saying to you, `If you persist in this design of forcing your daughter into the arms of Ruthven, he will have a corpse for a bride!”' Dr. Vandyke rose as he spoke, and added: “I have said all that I intended to say, except to communicate a slight circumstance of which you may be ignorant.” “Your slight circumstance, if it please you, sir,” said Colonel Brand, with sudden ire, “your chivalric espousal of the interests of my family, leads me to anticipate newer and more startling intelligence!” “Pride—pride!” growled Dr. Vandyke, sotto voce. “This figure in buckram, dubbed `colonel,' is a simulacrum worked by that mainspring! Pull the string, he jumps to it!” “You say, sir—” “That I am a fool to come here, and give you the result of my diagnosis of your daughter's condition. I am an intruder—a meddler! Well, at least, you know all now. I tell you that Honoria Brand is sinking day by day under this terror—that her life is not worth twelve months' purchase; that she loves one man with absolute passion, and you think to force her, without fatal results, into the embrace of another! Do so, then— you are master! I am not here to beg you to do this or to do that. I have no more to say—yes, one word more, to inform you of the trifling circumstance to which allusion was made by me just now. Your proposed son-in-law, my Lord Ruthven, is mad.” “Mad!” “I use the colloquial term. Insane, if you prefer the word—I call him mad.” Colonel Brand seemed utterly astounded. “And what proof have you to allege in support of this very astounding—this most absurd statement, sir?” “None but the fact—I say he is mad; and, if you doubt it now, you will ascertain the fact hereafter. Do not question me further! I have already said more than becomes the physician who has attended a patient. The physician and the priest are bound to silence. Act as seems best to you—for myself, I wish you good-day, sir!” And Dr. Vandyke abruptly left the room — he had already taken leave of everybody—and hastened to his coach, which he entered, slamming the door. The vehicle rolled down the hill rapidly, and passed through the great gate. “Toward Williamsburg, sir?” said the driver, drilled to ask those directions which Dr. Vandyke never gave. “No!” exclaimed the physician, almost furiously—“to the mountain!” And he pointed westward. The obedient Jehu, without a word, turned his leaders to the right, and followed the road which Phil Cary had pursued in his ride to Innis's dwelling. No snow had fallen since the youth's ride, and, save where the wind had obliterated the tracks, the footprints of his horse were still visible. But Dr. Vandyke seemed perfectly familiar with the route. The coach ascended the mountain-road, drawn rapidly by four powerful horses, which plunged through the deep snow, snorting and smoking. “A cheerful landscape!” muttered Dr. Vandyke, blowing his fingers to keep them warm. “To live in this elevated wilderness, and have your sweetheart about to marry another—ough!” And the physician knit his brows, and fell back, shouting to his coachman: “Faster!—there is the house I am going to!” The small lodge of Innis was indeed visible beneath the great pines; and in fifteen minutes more the coach had stopped before it. Dr. Vandyke got out, and waded through the snow, and knocked. The door opened as he touched it. Innis was seen standing on the threshold. “Welcome, doctor!” he said; “I saw you coming up the mountain, and was awaiting you.” “It is well,” returned Dr. Vandyke, looking at the young man from under his bushy brows. “I had sworn to break down this door, if kicking would break it down!” And he entered.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">XLIV. THE LETTER. Colonel Brand had closed the door of the library behind Dr. Vandyke, reseated himself with evident marks of agitation in his great arm-chair, and was sunk in troubled thought, when a timid knock was heard. He said, harshly, “Come in!” and Lady Brand entered. She was pale, and trembled slightly, for Colonel Brand had achieved that poor triumph of making all around him afraid of him. His wife was no exception—she stood in awe of the stiff personage; but now she had evidently made up her mind to brave his ire. “Dr. Vandyke leaves us in displeasure, I fear,” she said, approaching and seating herself. “Is it not in consequence of a conversation in reference to Honoria?” “Yes, madam!” snapped Colonel Brand, losing all his hauteur. “Oh, tell me! Did he not urge you to break off our poor child's marriage with Lord Ruthven?” “Yes, madam!” “Upon the ground that—that—she loved Edmund Innis, and shrunk from Lord Ruthven?” “Yes, madam!” These three “Yes, madams!” were uttered with increasing vehemence. Colonel Brand had grown fiery, and looked dangerous. “Then—oh! then!—'tis your own poor child, remember—!” “Stop, madam!” exclaimed Colonel Brand; “this interview which you are good enough to inflict upon me at a very inopportune moment—I say a very in opportune moment, madam!—has proceeded sufficiently far! It is unnecessary to continue it, and, to speak plainly, I desire you to be silent! I am the master in this house, for the present at least, and I will not have my will disputed in consequence of the underhand schemes —the meddling interference—of this Dr. Vandyke—this dwarf, who had the insolence—yes, the insolence, madam!— to inform me that—that—he had been, forsooth, once upon a time, your suitor —that is to say, my rival!” The poor lady's head sank, and her frame trembled. “There was no wrong done,” she murmured, a slight color appearing in the thin cheek. “I was a girl, and Dr. Vandyke was a young gentleman highly respected.” “We will cease to discuss your former affairs of the heart, if it please you, madam!” “Willingly,” said Lady Brand, sadly. “I designed no allusion whatever to them. But it is my duty, and I must perform it, however it may excite your displeasure—it is my duty as a mother, to say that I think Honoria is wasting away, will die, if—” The faltering voice here quite broke down. “Oh, do not insist on this marriage!” she exclaimed. Colonel Brand was not as completely master of himself as he fancied. The trembling voice shook his stern coldness. Wheeling round and facing the lady, he exclaimed: “You would, then, have me break my plighted word!” “You did not know of this terrible result when you gave your word.” “This is sophistry, madam!—the jugglery of reasoning, which smooths over a breach of faith, because to keep it is not agreeable or desirable! No, madam! I have sworn that Honoria shall marry Lord Ruthven, and I will keep my oath!” Lady Brand bowed her head, and fixed her eyes, red with weeping, upon the carpet. “So be it,” she said, in a low voice; “but if Honoria dies, I shall die too.” Colonel Brand's features contracted, but he only replied: “I must keep faith.” Lady Brand raised her head and looked at him. “Even if he—Lord Ruthven—exhibits a desire to retire from the affair?” “`Lord Ruthven retire!' Lord Ruthven exhibit a desire to—” Your meaning, madam?” “I mean that Lord Ruthven treats our daughter and ourselves with scant courtesy.” “You would say—” “That a month, wellnigh, has passed since we have heard from him, and he has not visited Rivanna at all. Colonel Brand turned pale. He had required no notice of the fact, but had avoided all allusion to it. “Something has prevented him—the mails are irregular,” he said, knitting his brows. “Other letters from the capital arrive promptly.” Colonel Brand was silent. He had not been prepared for this direct discussion of a circumstance which had secretly stung him, and had no reply ready. “I thank Heaven,” said Lady Brand, “that Lord Ruthven has not visited us, and am even pleased at his not having written. O Colonel Brand! Honoria's apathy is fearful — worse a thousand times than agitation—than despair!” The father groaned. “And all comes from this infatuation for a boy — a curly pate—this Edmund Innis!” “'Twas natural!—he is a generous and noble boy.” “You would say that he is generous to us! But you know well my resolution, madam! I say this `noble boy' has produced our household misery, and, by Heaven! Honoria shall marry Ruthven if only to teach him a lesson!— Speak no further of this, madam! I have sworn, and will keep my oath! Honoria is promised to Lord Ruthven, and he shall have her, if I am alive to give her away! This `apathy' you speak of is the folly of a child! Once Lady Ruthven—a countess, madam!—she will forget all else. Now, no more of this. I am resolved!” Lady Brand rose and placed her handkerchief to her eyes. As she did so, a servant entered and handed respectfully to his master the bag containing the mail. The first letter he drew forth was one from Lord Ruthven, which he opened and hastily perused. “As I supposed, madam,” he said, “Lord Ruthven has been ill—is so still. But he expresses an earnest hope that his recovery will be sufficiently safe to enable him to claim Honoria's hand upon the day appointed for the ceremony. See the letter.” But Lady Brand made a movement with her thin hand. “I do not desire to read it,” she said, “and I must return to Honoria.” She left the room as she spoke, uttering a low sob as she disappeared. The sob was echoed by a groan from the proud gentleman, who sank back in his chair—bent, shrunken, and looking ten years older than an hour before.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">XLV. IN WHICH DR. VANDYKE PROPOSES TO MAKE A NIGHT OF IT. Dr. Vandyke walked into the small sitting-room of Innis's mountain lodge, with the air of a gentleman who feels perfectly at home; and posting himself with his back to the fire, his slender legs wide apart, and his voluminous skirts gathered under his arms, looked around with interest and some curiosity. The room was small and low-pitched, but with an ample fireplace, in which a fire of heavy logs was quietly burning, the mass supported on old - fashioned brass andirons, with grotesquely-carved heads, resembling the ancient masks. The carpet had once been superb, with bouquets of flowers in their natural colors, but was now quite faded, and, where the legs of the small square table in the centre of the room rested upon it, was worn with holes which showed the floor beneath. The furniture of the room was very old, but had evidently belonged to persons of taste and elegance. It consisted of a large carved sofa of some dark wood covered with rich cloth, and an old sideboard with worn silver, some chairs with elaborately - ornamented backs and dark cushions, two large arm-chairs on each side of the fireplace, a venerable harpsichord, and a tall clock in one corner, reaching from the floor to the ceiling, with a great white face, black hands, and colored representations of the sun, moon, and stars, above the face. On the walls, yellow with age, were a number of engravings representing the battle of Blenheim, and other scenes in the wars of Marlborough, wherein the roughly - engraved figures of wooden-looking human beings lay about, and automata-like horses pranced in the cavalry-charge; and on each side of the mantel-piece, which was very tall and supported a few books, was a comic engraving by Hogarth, the one representing a cock-fight, and the other the idle apprentice playing upon a tombstone. There were but two portraits in the room —those of Innis's father and mother. These faced each other on the eastern and western walls, and represented, the first a gentleman of distinguished bearing, his smiling face half covered by a flowing peruke; the other a lady of great beauty and very high-spirited appearance—the frames of dark oak, the canvas dingy. In one corner, a fowling-piece leaned, supporting a bird-bag of netted twine; and near this a small bookcase stood against the wall, half filled with odd volumes in brown leather, of histories, poems, romances, and treatises on English law. Dr. Vandyke took in these details of the apartment with a comprehensive glance; drew a huge watch from his fob, and consulted it, glancing as he did so through the window at the sun, which was already declining; and, abruptly turning to Innis, said: “I have come to dine with you, and perhaps to spend the night.” “Thanks, doctor,” said Innis, who was pale, and spoke in a dull, apathetic voice. “I am fortunate enough to be able to entertain you, and to provide for your horses too. My old servant will see that the horses and driver want nothing.” The young man went as he spoke into an adjoining room, through the door of which Dr. Vandyke saw a neat bed; and, coming back in a few moments, said: “All will be attended to, doctor— there is old Ned showing the way to the stables; and now, welcome again to my poor home. I had not expected to see you in so remote a spot.” “That's natural, and I am not quite sure of my own identity; but I believe the individual who has the honor to address you is Dr. Julius Vandyke.” “You were at Rivanna, no doubt, and took the fancy—” “Stop all that roundabout talk, my young friend,” said the doctor, abruptly; “let us throw ceremony to the dogs, and come to business. You are breaking your heart about Honoria Brand—come, deny it, if you can!” An expression of great wretchedness came to the young man's face. “Who am I, to presume to look up to Miss Brand?” he said, bitterly. “You are a man—and a gentleman, too, if there is any difference! I say you are making yourself unhappy about a girl, and I have come here to have a little talk with you on that subject.” Innis shook his head gloomily. “What good will come of it?” he said. “Let the ashes cover it — you know the warning of the Latin poet: `Do not disturb the ashes that conceal the hidden fire.”' “I know a little Latin, but I choose to think and resolve for myself. I mean to talk about this affair—to talk to my heart's content! But I propose to dine first, as I perceive the odor of that meal, and welcome it.” The door opened as Dr. Vandyke spoke, and an old family servant with gray hair, and a profoundly deferential bearing, made his appearance, and proceeded to set the table. He then disappeared, but soon served dinner, which was plain but appetizing. As the host and his guest sat down, a knock was heard at the outer door; the doctor's driver appeared with a leather-covered case, and this case the doctor at once opened, producing a brace of heavy, square bottles, through whose transparent sides a ruby-colored liquid was seen to agitate itself, as the bottles were deposited on the table. “Always travel with my liquor-case,” said the doctor. “Rum—and superb!” He pushed the square bottle to Innis, who poured out some, but scarcely touched the glass with his lips. “Come! drink—eat!” cried Dr. Vandyke, with his mouth full of ham. “I have no appetite to-day, doctor,” was the reply. “And had none yesterday, I'd be willing to swear. Such is the effect of this abominable love-business.” The doctor continued to growl throughout the repast, in which Innis rather affected to join than took any real part; and in due time the cloth was removed, and host and guest drew their chairs to the fire. “This is comfortable,” said Dr. Vandyke, leaning forward and rubbing his knees, with a glance through the window at the sun, about to disappear behind the mountain. “Snow a foot deep without, but a good fire within of bickory-logs that warms one through and through! Hear the wind, how it howls! Faith! I'll brew a bowl of punch to crown the victory over Boreas, and we'll make a night of it!” As he spoke, the doctor rose and pounced upon a great bowl of porcelain on the sideboard; at the same moment the old major-domo appeared with a japanned waiter containing a silver coffee-pot, and some small cups of exquisitely thin china, richly colored. “Coffee!” cried the doctor; “how now, thou Sybarite! But if coffee—then hot water! Some hot water, my aged friend; I see before me the sugar!” With profound deference the old servant brought in hot water; the doctor proceeded to brew the punch, which he subsequently dealt out with a silver ladle; and, having informed his host that he preferred firelight to candles, the eccentric guest resumed his arm-chair before the fire, rubbed his legs with an air of enjoyment, and said: “I beg to offer a toast! To our common and highly-esteemed friend the most excellent lady, who once came near espousing the amiable Julius Vandyke!” With these words, the amiable Julius Vandyke raised his ponderous feet, placed them upon the cross-piece of his chair, elevated thus his knees very nearly to the level of his eyes, and, leaning his head back, swallowed his glass of punch at one gulp. Innis had never lost his apathetic expression. He now said: “The lady you were near espousing once, doctor?” “Lady Brand.” “Ah! You were once an admirer of my aunt?” “At least I asked her to marry me, in this very room.” “In this room?” “Hold! She was sitting yonder. The sun was setting, and the shadow of the crooked pine-tree there was thrown upon the face of the old clock. It was half-past six in the evening, I remember.” Innis looked at the eccentric being before him, who was now clasping his arms around his drawn-up knees. “You surprise me, doctor,” he said. “I did know—” “That this house was familiar to me? Perfectly; and, as we have plenty of time to-night, suppose I tell you a little of what the poets would call the `romance of my existence?”' Innis inclined his head; and, refilling his glass with a bacchanalian air, Dr. Vandyke said:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">XLVI. THE ROMANCE OF DR. VANDYKE. “I am, correctly speaking, not Dr. Vandyke, but the Baron Julius von Dyke, a German by birth, and belonging to a family whose representatives held important commands in the armies of the Emperor Charles V. As I am a person, however, of democratical opinions, I do not value the von in my name a farthing, and will sell you my patent of baron for sixpence. I will not enlarge upon the former importance of my family, which, in time, grew poorer— then poorer—then landless. Whereupon the baron, my father, went to London; was induced to emigrate to Virginia; brought me, his only son, with him; and died, leaving me at twenty-five possessed of a small, a very small, estate, but, what was better, an education as a physician, the result of study at Göttingen. “Well, when my father died, I found myself quite alone, and did not much relish the lonely life of a country physician in Charles City, where my small estate lay; so I disposed of the land, removed to Williamsburg, and announced that I was ready to administer pills and draughts to the inhabitants of that thriving capital. “My success was not encouraging. The children ran behind their mother's dresses when I made my appearance; and once or twice it was intimated to me that, in certain cases connected with one branch of the leech's art, my personal appearance was calculated to produce unfortunate results. In fact, my young friend, I was hideously ugly—as ugly as I am at this moment, or very nearly—and, in consequence thereof, there was nothing in the world that I admired so much as personal beauty. This became, at last, almost a mania with me, and I would place myself at the window of my poor lodgings on Gloucester Street—a small room on the second floor of a small house—that which you one day entered with me—and, from this elevated perch, I would watch the passers-by on the street, riveting my eyes, with a passionate, craving admiration on the beautiful forms moving to and fro before me. Not a white, bending neck, seen beneath a blue scarf, not a slender foot with arched instep in its high-heeled shoe, or graceful figure, undulating as it moved on, but filled me with delight and admiration. And—not with that material sentiment which you might imagine— all was etherealized for me; beauty was poetry, and I enjoyed this beauty as a painter enjoys the beauty of a summer day, when white clouds float against a blue sky, over emerald fields and forests!” Dr. Vandyke stopped, to utter a short, grating laugh. “Poetical, you see, my young friend. Try the punch! No? Well, to go on with my romantic narrative: My greatest misfortune was to have inherited a mirror which afforded me a full-length view of my own exquisite proportions. This mirror was fixed against the wall between the windows of my lodging, and I had only to turn my head to see my own image. I did turn my head often, and chiefly after following with my eyes some handsome young cavalier on his prancing steed—some radiant young Apollo, with gracefully-fashioned figure, slender, erect, and elegant, straight limbs, rounded where they pressed against the saddle, attractive features, chestnut curls—some young Adonis, in a word, compared with whom I was a satyr of waste places—a monster. For, what did I behold in that fatal mirror? A being scarcely human. A thing, let us say, about four feet and a half in height, splay-footed, thin-legged, with enormous chest, the arms of a windmill, a head like a pumpkin, sunken eyes, wide mouth, no neck—a fearful, frightful lusus naturœ, sent into the world to appall children, and make the dogs bark—ha! ha! “Well, things went on thus for years, when one day I made the acquaintance of two young ladies on a visit to the capital: one was afterward your mother, the other your aunt. It was your aunt I fell in love with, and this came about in an accidental manner—if there be any accidents in the world. Colonel Seaton, the uncle of the young ladies, was addicted to high living, and, one day, on returning from a grand dinner, he was taken with an indigestion, which was near putting an end to him. The most prominent physician in the capital was sent for in great haste, but was absent. The consequence was, that I was called in to attend Colonel Seaton, and succeeded in relieving him so expeditiously that he conceived a high opinion of my abilities, and invited me to visit at his house as a friend. This offer I gladly accepted; and, as Colonel Seaton had known my father, the baron, I soon became a familiar friend of the family, and—fell in love with your aunt, Lady Brand.” Dr. Vandyke stopped suddenly, and plunging his hand into the capacious pocket of his great-coat, which he persisted in keeping on, drew forth a huge pipe and a handful of tobacco. “It is an extraordinary evidence of absent-mindedness in me to have forgotten my pipe,” he said. “Is the world coming to an end? Come, sweetest solace, come!” And, grinning amiably, the doctor filled the great bowl, picked up a coal with the tongs, lit his pipe, and began to puff out clouds of snowy smoke. “You won't smoke? No? Well, to continue my interesting narrative: Where did I stop? Oh, at the commencement of my charming little romance — what I call, elegantly, `the romance of Dr. Vandyke' — my love - affair with the young beauty from the mountains—from Rivanna, in a word.” And the doctor darted a keen glance at Innis, who remained cold and apathetic. “'Twas an absolute passion I conceived for the young lady,” said the doctor, smoking away in the most nonchalant manner, “and, after all, my young friend, there is nothing so strong as what is called love. Nothing hurts, for a short time, like disappointment therein! I will not enlarge upon the charming details of my affair, but will state what may appear to you, since it so appears to me, an astounding circumstance — the fact that the lady of my affections was not wholly unkind nor cold to her admirer, the present narrator. Ellen—you call her Aunt Ellen now, but she was then a blooming beauty, too youthful for auntship—was touched, it seems, by the devotion of the poor physician who evidently adored her. She blushed when Splay-foot entered: actually faltered in her address when she spoke to Bleareyes: and, one day, the presumptuous Wide-mouth said, `I love you!' — at which she no more shrunk than she would have shrunk from an Adonis! Can you believe that? I remember without believing it! And at that moment I tasted the first moment of real happiness I had tasted in the world! Then the poor, deformed dwarf was a human being after all!—the monster was not so hideous and repulsive as he had dreamed! —after all, he was a man, belonged to mankind, was not an ape, a wild-man of the woods, an object of disgust or horror. When I took her hand in my own she did not shudder or grow sick!—then she had seen that behind this mask was a heart and a brain—felt that the brain thought, and the heart throbbed; and her own heart melted—was nearly my own, I think!” Dr. Vandyke terminated this sentence with a grin, and, smoking with great gusto, said: “I am growing a little tired of this part of my subject, but nothing is so seductive as this analytical exposition of human nature under peculiar phases. You see, my dear friend, I am proceeding exactly as I proceed when a subject —a dead body, that is—is lying on a table before me, and I have the scalpel in my hand. I dissect a heart as I dissect a body. Well, what is the lesson that is sought to be demonstrated in the present lecture, my youthful friends—friend, that is? Why, that a deformed dwarf has actually a heart, feelings, passions, and that a woman can understand as much, and see the man through the hideous mask! To proceed. The romance is nearly ended. An interruption took place on that eventful morning, and the ladies left Williamsburg almost immediately. I did not see them again for some years. Then your mother had married your father—they came to this house to live—and, visiting Williamsburg once, Mrs. Innis invited me to come and see them, as an old friend, in their mountain-home. I did so, for my old romance remained untouched—and here I found your aunt. Shall I continue? I offered her my hand in this apartment. She did not reply either `Yes' or `No;' I was forced to return to the capital—and a year afterward she was Lady Brand. All that came about in the most natural way. Colonel Seaton brought the young lady to Williamsburg. She there met Colonel Brand. Her uncle, her friends, everybody, said, `Marry him,' and she finally did so, caring for him, as I happen to know, not a fig! I saw that at a glance; and what did I do, my friend? I said to her: `If you should ever require the aid of a true friend, send for me, and I will come to you, either by day or by night;' and then I went back to my duties, and forgot all about my romance, and don't care a farthing now for her beyond mere friendship, nor regret that she married my rival! “There's your pretty little romance, my boy!” said the doctor, laughing; “love, nay, passion! — disappointment, anguish, indifference, oblivion! That's the course of things in this curious world. You break your heart about a woman to-day, and in half a year you have forgotten her! Every thing changes, my son—nothing remains the same! Do you think that time, that wears away the very Pyramids, don't wear away human grief? The grief is the easier of the two, I assure you! Eternal despair!—nonsense! A year is not an eternity! Come! let us cease this philosophic strain! Drink me this glass of punch—'tis imperial! Vive la joie! and let dull care begone!” The doctor imbibed a huge mouthful of punch; refilled his glass; mounted with great agility into his chair, from which he stepped to the table, and, raising his arm until it nearly touched the ceiling, cried: “A health to Oblivion—the last, best friend of humanity!” At an hour past midnight, Dr. Vandyke was shown to bed by his host; and anybody who had looked at him would have seen upon his countenance an expression of unmistakable disappointment. In reply to his narrative, Innis had only said, with the same dull, apathetic look: “I said when you came, doctor, that I regarded you as one of my best friends —well, your history has more than ever convinced me of the fact. You relate your own disappointment, to impress upon me the moral that grief wears away, and indifference comes. So be it. I trust 'twill come! But I shall none the less leave this house and Virginia, in two days from this time, never to return. My house is sold, my valise is already packed—it is my great good fortune, as I turn my back forever on Virginia, to have heard your friendly voice, doctor. Good-night!” On the next morning, Dr. Vandyke returned to Williamsburg.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">XLVII. HALLUCINATION. A week after these events, Lord Ruthven was seated in an arm-chair, in his lodgings at Williamsburg, wrapped in his dressing-gown of figured silk. In a chair opposite sat Dr. Vandyke, whose eyes were fixed upon his patient. Ruthven was fearfully thin and pale. His frame seemed to have dwindled away; and his eyes had that dreamy, wandering expression which indicates the want of physical energy under the hand of disease. “So you think I shall recover now, doctor?” he said, in a low voice. “Unless you have a relapse, which, to be frank with you, is apt to prove fatal,” was the reply. Ruthven inclined his head. “I like frankness, doctor. I have had a dangerous attack, have I not?” “Very dangerous.” “You have not yet given me your opinion of my case—I should say, have not explained its nature, and I should be glad to know now the character of the disease which has just assailed me.” “Do you wish the scientific or the familiar definition; that is to say, jargon or intelligible statement?” “The familiar definition, doctor.— What has been the cause of my illness?” “Nervous prostration.” Ruthven nodded. “Your view coincides with my own. And to what was this prostration of the nervous system due; to physical or to mental causes?” “Do you wish a plain statement of your case? I hate beating round the bush,” said Dr. Vandyke, in his vibrating and metallic voice. “A plain statement, by all means, sir.” “Listen, then, my Lord Ruthven. Men of your organization and habits never undergo nervous prostration from physical causes. Drunkards, roués, and others, have attacks of that description. You are neither a drunkard nor a roué; thus the cause of disease is to be sought elsewhere; and I may as well inform you that I have not had long to seek. You have been ill, very ill, in consequence of mental excitement, which, reacting, as every thing does, on the body, has brought the physical system in sympathy with the mental condition—that is, made you ill. Beyond this, I see no necessity to go.” “And yet you have gone further?” The eyes of the two men met. “Yes,” said Dr. Vandyke, coolly. “You have discovered the source of my mental excitement.” “Yes.” “What is it?” “You wish me to speak plainly?” “Yes—yes.” “Well, I employ the scientific term now. You have been the victim of hallucination.” “The plainer term for which is—?” Ruthven looked with sudden intensity at the physician. “Second sight,” said Dr. Vandyke. Ruthven uttered a low groan, and closed his eyes as though he were about to faint. “Your—meaning?” he murmured. “I mean nothing—a mere jest,” said Dr. Vandyke; “here, a few drops of this cordial?” “No, doctor,” said Ruthven, sitting erect in his chair, and speaking in a firm voice. “I do not need it, and am stronger, I think, than you suppose. You would turn the conversation, I see, but do not fear—the topic does not agitate me.” He remained lost in thought for some moments; then he said: “I was not aware that you had turned your attention to a subject which few thinkers regard as worthy of their serious attention. Then you believe—in the superstition, as the world calls it, of —second sight?” He uttered the last words only after a moment's hesitation, and with evident repugnance. Dr. Vandyke looked fixedly at him, and said: “Believe in is a phrase which means much or little. If you tell me that you have seen a ghost and felt the breath of the grave issue from the phantom, I believe in the ghost—as far as it concerns yourself.” “Well, well,” was Ruthven's impatient exclamation, “but that is no reply. I ask if you believe that—” “Human beings in the island of Skye and in parts of Scotland fall into trances, and see the future? Yes—I believe that they believe it.” “Then you do not believe it?” Lord Ruthven murmured. “I believe in science, and science defines hallucination as plainly as it defines any other, the most rational operation of the human brain.” “We drop logic and fence with words, sir,” said Ruthven, impatiently. “You plainly have no faith in this— second sight,” again he paused before the words; “but suppose I were to tell you that I know persons—in my own family—who possess the fearful gift?” “Yourself, that is to say,” said Dr. Vandyke. “I know very well that second sight is hereditary, or people think so, ut ante—otherwise I should not have said, `Your nervous prostration is due to this cause.' Am I wrong?” “You have divined rightly.” The words were uttered in an almost sepulchral whisper. “Yes,” continued Lord Ruthven, gloomily, “my family has for two hundred years been the victim of this frightful faculty. They have seen, in vision, the events that are to come—the faces, the figures, the scenes, have all passed before them. And the scenes of my future have passed before me!” “My lord!” said Dr. Vandyke. “Sir!” “You will have the goodness, if you please, to stop this sort of talk. I consented to discuss with you this scientific question, but had no design to bring on a second attack of nervous illness. In an evil moment I uttered the words, `hallucination' and `second sight.' I am sorry I did so, and it was a waste of time, too, for I now inform you frankly that your `second-sight' business is all flummery—moonshine.” “You think so?” came in a low voice from Ruthven's pale lips. “Well, so be it, sir.” “I know it! All froth and devil's deception! Let the thought alone! It will madden you! Buy a fiddle, and drink rum, and go and dance a dozen reels—there's your philosophic proceeding—and let these chimeras rest in congenial darkness.” Lord Ruthven bowed with calm courtesy, and said, coolly: “I thank you for your advice, doctor, and acknowledge that it is sound. And now let us have done with this rather melancholy subject, which I had no design to discuss, and was betrayed into, before becoming aware of the fact. What is my condition — when shall I recover?” “Speedily, if you have no relapse.” “I shall be able to—travel, say—in my coach—in a week?” “No.” “In two weeks?” “Possibly.” “Thanks, sir. That will serve my purpose.” “If you take my advice,” growled Dr. Vandyke, “you will put off this travelling for a month.” “That is impracticable, doctor, for reasons it is needless to detail.” “Right — I know them. You are going to Rivanna to marry Honoria Brand.” “Yes, doctor—I see that you are acquainted with my private affairs.” “Perfectly; and, perhaps, I know some circumstances unknown to yourself.” “Unknown?” “Do you know that Honoria Brand loves her cousin, Edmund Innis?” A cloud passed across Ruthven's brow, and his eyes grew cold and haughty. “I knew at least that Mr. Innis did the future Countess of Ruthven the honor to bestow his affections upon her.” “And this mutual attachment—for it is mutual—is no obstacle in your eyes?” “An obstacle? No! A cause of displeasure? Yes!” “Why, then—” “Persist in the offer of my hand, sir? For the very simple reason that marriage is not silly romance. This is better understood in Europe than in Virginia, sir! Do you fancy that in Europe young ladies neglect to enjoy their private romance? Everywhere they do so; but they form alliances, sir, upon solider foundations!” Dr. Vandyke listened to these words in gloomy silence. “Well,” he muttered, “'tis no affair of mine; I have done all I could, and this one is like the other at Rivanna.” Having solaced himself with this growl, Dr. Vandyke rose. “If she can't stand up, that will end it!” he added, in the same tone. He turned to Lord Ruthven. “You are doing well now, and need me no further,” he said. “Good-day, sir.” Before Lord Ruthven could reply he had left the room.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">XLVIII. WHAT OCCURRED AT THE WEDDINGDINNER. The morning of the day fixed on for Honoria's marriage came at last. All night the snow had been falling—the fields, forests, and mountains, were enveloped in a white shroud—and now, when the storm had ceased, a freezing wind had succeeded, howling around the gables and in the spectral trees, and driving the light snow before it in blinding gusts. Despite, however, the forbidding nature of the weather, the wedding-guests began to arrive at an early hour, curious to witness the ceremony of the wedding of a young lady of the quiet country neighborhood with a real nobleman. The invitations had been almost universal—no one with the slightest pretensions to good society having been omitted; but there had been a species of distinction made by the proud Colonel Brand. While a countless number were invited, as we now say, to “the ceremony,” which was to take place at night, invitations to dinner had been confined to a select few of the most prominent personages of the vicinity. These now arrived; but unfortunately, as the reader will perceive, there mingled with them some others, who, liberally regarding an invitation as an invitation, made their appearance in the forenoon, bent on dinner. Colonel Brand received every guest, however, with the formal politeness habitual with him; and general conversation ensued in the great drawing-room, where the motley throng warmed their chilled limbs before the mighty fire of roaring hickory. As yet, the ladies had not made their appearance, and the company separated itself into groups instinctively —the grand old nabobs, in powdered wigs, silk stockings, and ruffles, conversing, ore rotundo, with stately dignity, to themselves; the plainer planters, with waistcoats buttoned to their chins, and hair tied in plain knots behind, meanwhile exchanging in a coterie, some feet distant, observations on the approaching ceremony. As the forenoon passed on, guests continued to gather, and at last a movement of all heads in the direction of the window indicated the arrival of a personage of importance. This personage proved to be Lord Ruthven. He descended, wrapped in heavy furs, from his chariot, whose four horses were smoking and covered with foam, from the rapidity of the arduous journey through the snow, and entered the mansion, on the threshold of which Colonel Brand was ready to receive him. “Welcome to Rivanna, my lord!” said the colonel, with stately dignity, and bowing low, as, with outstretched hand, he greeted the bridegroom. “I had hoped for your earlier arrival, but the roads are, no doubt, most difficult.” Lord Ruthven bowed low in turn, uttered a few words in response to his host's greeting, and was ushered into the drawing-room where the assembled company was presented to him, one after another. He replied, in every instance, by a simple bow, and seemed entirely unaware of the fact that he was the centre of all eyes. All were struck with his pallor, and the settled gloom of his expression; and it was afterward remembered that, as he entered the room, he had looked around him in a most singular manner, growing paler than before. Another unusual circumstance also attracted attention. When, after the general introduction, some one spoke to him, he would suddenly rouse himself with a start from his species of reverie, gaze with a fearful expression at the speaker, and, even while replying in a few brief and constrained words, would glance over his right shoulder in a very unaccountable manner, as though he suspected the presence of some danger, against which it was necessary for him to be upon his guard. It was impossible that these very unusual circumstances, in connection with Lord Ruthven's appearance and demeanor, should not excite surprise, and occasion subsequent comment, on the part of the guests; but his lordship was quickly shown to his chamber, whither the silent and attentive Fergus had seen his travelling-trunks borne, and the door of the drawing-room closed abruptly, erecting an impassable barrier between the pale nobleman and the curious company. Nearly two hours then passed, when the door opened, and Lord Ruthven was again ushered in by the stately Colonel Brand. He had changed his travelling-dress, and had donned a dark costume of the richest and most elegant description. It was impossible not to be struck by his air of high breeding and distinction; but, as before, it was the singular face of the young nobleman which riveted all eyes. He was, if possible, paler than ever, and entered the room in sepulchral silence—a walking shadow. During the few moments which followed his entry he did not utter a word, but stood like a statue amid the crowd of guests, who unconsciously drew back. The appearance of the ladies afforded a welcome diversion. Lady Brand, accompanied by her daughters and her lady-guests, entered, and greeted her visitors. But she attracted attention for an instant only. All eyes were fixed upon Honoria, who was as pale as Lord Ruthven, and who resembled, in her white dress and with her whiter cheeks, a ghost, rather than a human being. Lord Ruthven had advanced quickly and bowed low, with stately courtesy, over the hands which Lady Brand and the young ladies held out. Honoria's was extended toward him in an abrupt and convulsive manner, and he found it as cold as ice. For an instant their eyes met—the sunken eyes of the girl wore a strange expression—but she preserved her self-possession, seemed unconscious of the scrutiny to which she was subjected, and seemed to regard with apathetic indifference the whole scene around her. Everybody felt relieved when the door opened, and the old, gray-haired major-domo, Robin, with a silver waiter under his arm, looked respectfully toward Colonel Brand, thus announcing that dinner was served. Lord Ruthven offered his arm to Lady Brand, who stood near him; the company entered the great dining-room, blazing with lights in silver candelabra —for night was near—and took their seats at the broad board whose rich blue china and old plate sparkled in the flood of light. The grand dinner went on its way in a stiff and stately manner, little relieved by conversation. Honoria sustained the glances of all without change in her apathetic expression, and sent away course after course nearly untasted. The only indication of her feelings was her frightful pallor; and this became at times so unnatural that Lady Brand was, more than once, upon the point of rising, and leading her from the room, under the apprehension that she was about to faint. Nothing, for some time, however, occurred to mar the festivity—if such it could be called. On the contrary, the stiffness of the scene gradually gave way before the rich wines; the awe felt for the ceremonious Colonel Brand, by a portion of the company, melted, and the dinner promised to terminate more cheerfully and cordially than it had commenced. But the fates were adverse. The heady wines had done their work. Ceremony was lost sight of by some of the honest old fellows who had construed their general invitation to the wedding, into an invitation to the wedding and dinner; and two of these old neighbors now began to discuss the approaching ceremony. The conversation of these worthy country gentlemen, now warmed by the colonel's canary, was not precise or formal, as will be seen; and a portion of it will account for what followed. “Strange enough,” said one of them to his old neighbor. “And beats the story-books all hollow, eh?” “All hollow,” replied his friend. “It was honorable in our friend Brand, though, to record it in the court of probate,” continued the first speaker. “If what they say is true, young Innis tore up the will, and swore he wouldn't take the property.” “Did he do that?” “I'm told so, and it's like his father's son; his father was as honest a gentleman as ever hunted a fox.” “A gentleman before he was born! So Ned Innis tore up the will?” “Yes, neighbor, and they say it was all on account of the boy's love for little Miss Honoria; and if so, I say it's a thousand pities he can't get her instead of this `my lord,' who looks like a block of ice, with a handful of snow for a face!” “Ha! ha! That's good, neighbor! A block of ice, ha! ha! A good thing! Yes, it's a thousand pities!” “And I'm told—hold your ear close, neighbor.” “Yes—” And the other drew nearer. “I'm told the little lady loves him better—a thousand times better—than her fine lord and master to be.” “Loves Ned Innis?” “Yes.” “That's a pity—a sad pity, neighbor. Loves the boy, did you say?” “Better than she loves herself. I drink your health, neighbor.” “Your good health! So this match is hard on her.” “Look at her; you can see that it is killing her!” “So it is—hum! hum!” “Such cheeks! Was any thing ever as white?” “As white as a sheet.” “Look! I think she's going to faint. There is Lady Brand getting up to take her out of the room!” “Yes—no! She is down again. A sad business, neighbor—a sad business.” And, overcome by grief, the worthy gentleman poured out a large glass of canary, passing the decanter to his neighbor, who imitated him. In the half an hour which followed, this ceremony was repeated several times, and the worthies began to talk thick. “And this will you told me of— where did they find it?” “In a desk where Colonel Seaton kept his private papers.” “You are wrong there, sir,” suddenly exclaimed a red-faced worthy next to the speaker. He had evidently partaken in large quantities of the canary, and spoke fiercely. “You are wrong! The will was found in a chest of drawers— not a desk.” “You are wrong, sir! 'Twas a desk!” was the retort of the first speaker. “I am not wrong, sir!” exclaimed the other, with drunken severity, “and I am not in the habit of stating what I don't know—do you hear, sir? If you doubt my word, sir, I'll soon show you whether I'm talking sense!” And, raising his voice to a pitch which drowned the conversation of the rest of the company, the red-faced speaker called out: “Colonel Brand!” The words rang out clearly, and instantly attracted everybody's eyes toward him who uttered them. The colonel, who was at the moment uttering a ceremonious compliment to a dowager seated on his left, suddenly turned his head, and frowned slightly. “Colonel Brand! I say, Colonel Brand!” came again from the impatient worthy. “Did you address me, sir?” said the host, with crushing dignity. “Yes, sir! I did. My word has been doubted, and I call on you to say if I know what I'm talking about or not!” Colonel Brand scowled at the rudeness of the speaker. “Being ignorant of the subject of your conversation, sir,” he said, “I am naturally unable to afford you the information which you are good enough to demand so loudly of me, sir!” But the colonel's interlocutor was beyond the point where hauteur makes any impression. The worthy only comprehended 8 that Colonel Brand meant to ask information, and cried: “I said that old Colonel Seaton's will—his last will in favor of young Innis's mother—was found in a chest of drawers, and not in a desk. This statement,” added the worthy with drunken dignity, “has been doubted!—and I call on you to say if I know what I'm talking about!” Colonel Brand felt the blood rush to his face, and an angry shot from his eyes. He controlled his rising wrath, however, and replied with intense hauteur: “I should prefer not discussing my private affairs at the dinner-table, sir!” “Well, that's just as you choose!” was the reply of the red-faced guest, whose wrath rose to meet that of his host. “You can talk or not talk, just as you like, but I say that the will was found in a chest of drawers; and, moreover, that young Innis was a fool to tear it up, and let you have his property!” “Sir!” gasped the colonel, flushing crimson and glaring at the speaker, “are you aware that you are in a gentleman's house!—at my table!—in the presence of ladies!” “I know where I am!” growled the worthy, “and that—” “This is a vulgar intrusion, sir!—I— I—!” The colonel gasped for breath; but his ire flew off harmless from the canary-heated guest. “Vulgar, am I?—an intruder, am I?” exclaimed that worthy; “and only because I say what everybody is saying! I'm not to be frowned down, Colonel Brand, if you are marrying your daughter to a lord, who's no better, in my opinion, than any other man!” “Will you—have the goodness—!” Colonel Brand began thus, and we are sorry to say, ended with a violent oath, which produced no effect, however, on his valorous opponent. “Don't be swearing at me!” was the wrathful response. “I'm not your slave, sir! If you only knew it, everybody has his opinion of your marrying your daughter against her will to this foreigner, when she loves young Innis— he loves her too, and gives up his whole property to the man who's come to take away his sweetheart!” A low cry followed the words, and Lady Brand caught Honoria in her arms. The girl had fainted, and was borne from the apartment in the midst of a scene of the utmost agitation and confusion. Above this scene towered the wrathful form of Colonel Brand; and it is impossible to say what might have occurred, had not his drunken opponent been borne almost forcibly from the room, and soon afterward to his home. For some moments the colonel stood silent, flushed with rage, and drawing long breaths. He was evidently struggling against his rage, and succeeded in controlling himself. But the attention of all was more particularly directed to Lord Ruthven. His expression was full of the deadliest menace, and he resembled a tiger about to spring. Those who had looked at him during the utterance of the vulgar insults of the drunken guest, said afterward that his hand had silently glided to his side where the Highland dirk is generally suspended, and that his glaring eyes betrayed a positive thirst for the offender's blood. Colonel Brand's voice all at once made itself heard in the turmoil. In stern and gloomy tones, he said: “I pray those who have done me the honor to assemble at my board, to forget, if possible, this offensive intrusion of this vulgar person. Such accidents must occur, when persons unfamiliar with the commonest rules of good-breeding, are invited to mingle in the society of gentlemen. I disdain to reply to this man's insults; and Mr. Innis—my young friend and kinsman, now undisputed owner of the lands of Rivanna—would be the first to express his disgust at this vulgar insolence!” The colonel resumed his seat, and the dinner went on its way, but the festivity was all hushed. The meal ended in ominous silence, and the company rose and returned to the drawing-room. At the same moment the great hall-door was thrown open. A newly-arrived personage, wrapped in a huge cloak, stamped to cleanse the snow from his feet —and this personage, coming into the circle of light, revealed the squat and powerful figure, the long, gray hair, and piercing eyes of Dr. Vandyke.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">XLIX. THE CONTENTS OF RUTHVEN'S TRUNKS. As Lord Ruthven passed Dr. Vandyke, on his way to the drawing-room, their eyes met, and the young nobleman, going close to him, said, in a low voice, quite inaudible to the rest of the company: “I wish to have a few moments' private conversation with you, doctor.” Dr. Vandyke's piercing glance seemed to aim at penetrating the design of the speaker: but Ruthven remained calm and impressive. “When?” said Dr. Vandyke. “In half an hour.” “Where?” “In my chamber.” The physician nodded. “I will come thither; but will first go see Lady Brand and the child, Meta. I came for that.” With these words, Dr. Vandyke bestowed a comprehensive nod upon the company, who gazed at his singular figure with some astonishment, and proceeded, without ceremony, toward the wing of the mansion, in which Meta's chamber was situated. Colonel Brand, who had greeted the doctor with a stately bow, looked after him, and now said: “Our friend Dr. Vandyke is a somewhat singular personage, my lord.” “But a most estimable person,” returned Ruthven. “Assuredly; and I owe him my personal thanks for coming through such weather to see Meta.” “She is better, I trust, sir?” “We hope so.” “'Tis a pleasing augury, on an occasion of this description,” said Ruthven; “and now, with your permission, sir, I will retire to my chamber for a short space.” Colonel Brand bowed. “I will conduct you, my lord.” “'Tis unnecessary. Let me not take you from your guests.” And, with a gesture of courteous refusal, Lord Ruthven went up the great staircase toward his chamber. As he entered he saw Fergus standing with his back toward him, gazing upon a portrait upon the wall between two of the lofty windows. The apartment was elegantly furnished with what is now called an “ashes-of-roses” carpet, a centre-table of carved oak, easy-chairs, a couch, an immense bed, and in the fireplace burned a cheerful fire. For the moment, Fergus seemed quite unaware of all these surroundings. His eyes were fixed upon the portrait with absorbing attention; and, looking in the same direction, Lord Ruthven betrayed much astonishment. The portrait was an exact likeness of himself, and this fact evidently astounded the old body-servant. Ruthven speedily remembered, however, that Colonel Brand had informed him of the existence of this portrait of the elder Lord Ruthven—which had been hung in this apartment after its removal from Honoria's chamber— and he wondered that he had not noticed it on his first entrance. “That is a striking likeness, Fergus,” he said. The old body-servant suddenly turned round. “Is it a picture of the late lord or of your lordship?” “Of the late lord, who was Colonel Brand's friend.” Fergus nodded. “'Twould do for either, my lord, and is surprising.” Ruthven stood for some time, gazing at the painting. “The sight of this picture takes me back to Ruthven Castle, when I was a child, Fergus,” he said; “and that seems a long time ago.” “A very long time, my lord.” “And who would then have dreamed that Fate would conduct me to this remote spot in the Virginia mountains; that my errand here would be to find a Lady Ruthven; and that, at the very moment when the ceremony is about to take place, I should see my father, as it were, looking at me with his sad, stern eyes; for the eyes are very sad, Fergus— full of melancholy, I think!” The words were uttered in a sorrowful voice, and Lord Ruthven's head drooped. “Strange destiny,” he murmured; “and who can foretell his fate? Singular current of events! That portrait was painted when the original was a strong and stalwart man — I a rosycheeked child. He is long dead now— and I am no longer a happy child, but a very sorrowful man, Fergus — sorrowful, but not bad, Fergus! I think there is even much good in me, old friend. My — visions — have not disturbed me now for weeks—a strange softness and kindness seem to have come to me! Shall I be happy, then? Has my evil genius fled, to make way for the beneficent spirit of love and happiness?” “Heaven grant it, my lord!” said Fergus, with earnest feeling. “Perchance 'tis you who are my good genius, Fergus,” said Ruthven, with a glance of affection. “You are devoted to me, I know, as few clansmen are to their chieftains.” “Devoted, my lord?” said the old man, with a flush in his aged cheeks; “that is scarcely the word. You are more to me than I am to myself! Your happiness and honor are no less, nay, more, my care than your own! I would guard them, as the watch-dog guards his charge on the hills; and, 'tis not much to say that I would die for you!” Fergus turned away to hide the emotion, of which he seemed to be somewhat ashamed, and busied himself in taking from Lord Ruthven's trunks the various articles of his wardrobe. Among these were two or three dress-swords—at that time a portion of the full toilet of a gentleman—and these he laid upon the table. Next came a number of articles of dress, and then a curiously-fashioned Highland dirk. At sight of this weapon, Ruthven approached, and said, gently: “Replace that dangerous-looking affair, Fergus; 'tis out of place on so happy an occasion. Why was it brought?” “From habit, my lord. We Highlanders, you know, carry the dirk, as the Sassenach wears his rapier. 'Tis from custom; and this came with the other things.” “So be it; but hide it away—'twould fright some of the servants.” “I will obey you, my lord.” And Fergus replaced the grim-looking weapon in the trunk, where it lay, concealed beneath an embroidered coat and the ruffled linen of its owner. “Your lordship will not change your dress?” said Fergus, when this ceremony had been performed. “No, Fergus; I am, I believe, properly attired.” At this same moment a knock came at the door. “Come in,” said Ruthven.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">L. META AND HER PHYSICIAN. Meta was lying on a small couch beside the fire, in her little apartment in one of the wings; and Lady Brand, who had succeeded in soothing Honoria's agitation, and had intrusted her to the care of her bridesmaids, had come for a few moments to see Meta before the ceremony. The child was very thin and white, and her black hair, lying in profuse curls upon the snowy pillow, framed the sweet countenance, lit up by a tender smile. Lady Brand was engaged in conversasation with Meta, sighing deeply from time to time, as she thought of Honoria, when steps were heard approaching. The door suddenly opened, and a hearty voice cried: “Well, my little snow-drop, how are we to-day?” With the words, Dr. Vandyke clattered into the apartment, shook hands vigorously with Lady Brand, and then went to Meta. “Oh, I am very glad to see you, doctor,” said the child, with a bright smile. “Do you know there is something about you—I don't know what, but I think it is sunshine!” This seemed to highly please Dr. Vandyke. “Hear her!” he exclaimed. “And this is your boasted invalid—your pining sick girl!” “I am not pining, doctor!” “I should think not! Pining? Ha, ha! You are radiant, inspiring, sunbeam like—positively jolly!” exclaimed the doctor, in search of a word. “Then I am better?” “You are getting well so fast that it is a perfect farce for me to be coming all the way from Williamsburg, through the snow, to look after you. But I knew 'twas unnecessary. I came to the wedding.” Meta looked a little sad at this, and sighed. “Yes, Cousin Honoria is to be married,” she said, pensively; “and mamma tells me everybody in the neighborhood is here.” Dr. Vandyke's preternaturally acute ear caught the sigh, and his penetrating intelligence comprehended it. “Edmund Innis is the only one absent,” he said; “but that is easily accounted for: he's left the country, for a time.” “Left the country, doctor?” “Yes; some time since. You see, my dear, he had a sort of weakness for Mam'selle Honoria, and was unwilling to be present on this joyous occasion. At first he was unhappy about the affair, and would see nobody — not even his friend Phil Cary. When he perceived the approach up the mountain-road of that young man, he shut up doors and windows, retired to his inner den, and would not open. I went to see him, however, and he did me the honor to receive me.” “And—?” began Meta, eagerly. “We talked about the matter—discussed it in every form; and I found my young friend quite resigned. The affair was unlucky, he said, but such things would occasionally occur. He had loved Honoria—but that was over now. He could still love her as her brother.” Meta closed her eyes, murmuring to herself: “And I have changed too. I love him only as a sister might.” “What did you say, my dear?” “Nothing, doctor. I am so glad that —Edmund — is resigned, and does not grieve.” “Grieve? I think not! Why, my dear little one, only conceive that we spent a jolly night together. I give you my word of honor, we made a bowl of punch, and, as well as I remember—the punch was rather strong—we, or I, at least, chanted a bacchanalian song—ha! ha!” What Dr. Vandyke stated “on his word of honor” was always the truth— omitting that phrase, he considered himself, on certain occasions, and for certain purposes, justifiable, we are sorry to say, in telling lies. “The song sung on this occasion was, I believe, `The Jolly Miller,”' he continued. “You have not heard it? It commences thus—” And, in a powerful voice, gesticulating as he sung, Dr. Vandyke chanted: “`There was a jolly miller, And a jolly wight was he”'— At which point he suddenly stopped, exclaiming: “But the fine company will be startled by my mellifluous strains! Let us respect the rules of good society, my friends.” And, looking sidewise at Meta, Dr. Vandyke saw that she was ready to laugh. “Good!” he muttered; “who says there's no advantage in playing the buffoon?” And, in his careless, hearty voice, he said aloud: “In fact, my dear, we made a night of it, and I came near inducing our young friend Innis to be present at the wedding, take things philosophically, and not go on his travels. He determined, nevertheless, to adhere to his original intention not to come, and to make a brief tour, at least, with a view of coming back home when he had quieted down. So he went—won't be here — and now let us talk of other things. You are fast recovering, my dear. I am going to feel your pulse, and put my ear on your chest, just for the form of the thing.” Dr. Vandyke then enclosed the thin wrist of Meta in his immense hand, the index-finger touching the vein. At the same moment he bent down and placed his ear upon the child's breast. “Pulse, excellent; breathing, all that could be wished,” he said. “Only keep up your spirits, my little snow-bird, and you'll soon be well.” Meta smiled. The intelligence in reference to Innis had inexpressibly relieved her, and now the good news of her condition further cheered her. “You are very changeable in your comparisons, doctor,” she said; “you make me out at one moment a snow- drop, and then a snow-bird.” “And are you not both? say, little Miss White-face, with your little chirping voice.” “You must be trying to make me laugh, doctor.” “To make you laugh? Not a bit— I am telling you the truth. You are getting well.” Meta's face was lit up by a tender, happy light. “I am very, very glad, doctor,” she said, gently. “I am not afraid to die, for God is kind and good, and I do not fear Him—I love Him, and think He would receive me, a poor little child. But I would like to live—to be with mamma, and all I love so—now.” Dr. Vandyke's face slightly flushed. “Right,” he said, no longer able to preserve his jocular air, and gazing, as he spoke, at the child with great tenderness. He then looked at his watch, and turned to Lady Brand, who had just risen. “I must retire and change my dress now, madam. Will you show me my chamber?” “At once, doctor.” And, assuring Meta that she would send her her old nurse, who generally remained in the chamber, Lady Brand went out with the doctor, closing the door. When they were thus alone, the lady said: “You do not think as favorably of the poor child's condition as you seem to do, doctor?” “No,” said Dr. Vandyke. “Why, then—” “Tell her lies? Because, if she lives, 'twill smooth the way; if she dies, 'twill do no harm. I make it a point to tell lies in my profession, madam. There is no change for the worse, that is all.” Lady Brand sighed. “And what you said of Edmund?” “Was a lie also,” returned Dr. Vandyke, with candor. “He is wretched enough. I tried to cheer him and console him, but could do nothing; and can only say, I think nothing unfortunate will happen, which I feared.” “Heaven grant it! Whither did he go, doctor?” “I do not know.” “This sad, sad business!” “Very sad, madam; but life is a sad affair, however you take it. Now, time is passing, and I have an appointment with Lord Ruthven, who wishes to see me, he says, for a few moments. Which is his chamber?” “The second door on the right after ascending the main staircase. You will scarcely have time, doctor. Honoria's toilet is made, and the ceremony will soon take place.” “There will be time, doubtless.” With which words Dr. Vandyke gained the hall, mounted the great staircase, which wound up to the area above, and knocked at Lord Ruthven's door just at the moment when Fergus had replaced the Highland dirk in the trunk, and asked his master if any change was necessary in his dress.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LI. THE INTERVIEW BETWEEN LORD RUTHVEN AND DR. VANDYKE. At the words “Come in!” Dr. Vandyke turned the knob of the door and entered. In the few moments which had elapsed since the end of the interview with Meta, the eccentric physician's impression had undergone an entire change. In the child's chamber he had laughed, jested, nearly played the clown —now he was cold, stern, collected, with the air of a man who does not particularly relish the society of the person with whom he is about to converse, and has made up his mind to be surprised at nothing. As Dr. Vandyke advanced into the apartment, Lord Ruthven bowed with calm courtesy, and said: “Welcome, doctor; I thank you for your punctuality.” He then turned to Fergus. “Leave us to ourselves, Fergus, closing the door carefully. Remain there without, and see that no one approaches the door. I wish to converse for a few moments with Dr. Vandyke.” Fergus silently left the apartment, closing the door after him. Lord Ruthven's next proceeding was singular. He raised a window and looked out upon a species of balcony, apparently to ascertain if any one were there; closed the window, went and sounded the walls, carefully locked the door, and then returned to the fireplace, near which Dr. Vandyke was standing. “We are entirely alone, doctor,” he said, “and may converse upon matters the most secret without danger of being overheard.” Dr. Vandyke looked intently at Ruthven, but simply nodded. “This interview is, no doubt, a mystery to you—I mean its object?” continued Lord Ruthven. “Humph!—perhaps—perhaps not.” “We shall see—but you have visited Meta. She is better, I trust?” “No better.” “Worse?” “No worse.” “But not agitated—suffering?” “Not at all.” “Will she live, or die?” Lord Ruthven seemed unable or unwilling to come to the real subject of the interview. “Will she live, or die?” repeated Dr. Vandyke. “To answer that question I should require to be a divinity—and I am a worm! What matters it? What is life or death? This child will see the spring-flowers at Rivanna—or in heaven! 'Tis the same.” A dreamy glance of the eyes accompanied the words. The metallic voice was suddenly modulated, and sounded like music. “You seem moved, doctor,” said Lord Ruthven. “Moved?” “Your voice grows soft—I scarcely recognize it.” “Well, that is the sequel of talking with a sick girl. I am nearly seventy, without illusions—my heart is hard— well, the patience and sweetness of this child have melted me. But, to business!” Lord Ruthven bowed. “True, doctor—and time presses. I have not requested you to inform me of Miss Brand's condition; she fainted in consequence of a very disgusting scene at dinner, but has, I am assured, recovered now, and is preparing for the approaching ceremony.” “Yes.” Ruthven was silent for a moment; then he looked fixedly at the doctor, and said: “'Tis of the ceremony—my marriage —that I desire to speak with you.” “I know it.” Ruthven was again silent. The glance fixed upon Dr. Vandyke grew more intense. “We are losing time, doctor,” he said, with sudden gloom. “Well, come to the point!” “I will do so. You think me—insane!” “Is that a question?” “Reply to the words as though they were, doctor.” “To be frank, then—I do.” “And yet, you are absolutely mistaken.” Dr. Vandyke smiled grimly, but said nothing. This silence and the expression of the physician's countenance apparently irritated Lord Ruthven. “You would say—if you said any thing, sir,” he exclaimed—“that madmen never believe themselves mad, would you not? Well, that is perfectly just, and I do not ask you to take my own denial. What I do ask of you is, an attentive perusal of this paper.” And, taking from his breast a folded document, Ruthven extended it toward Dr. Vandyke. “'Tis a strange testimony, and on a strange subject,” said Ruthven, relapsing into gloom, “as you will perceive, sir. I, too, was disposed to entertain, at one time, the same conviction you entertain —regarded myself as of unsound mind— and took steps to determine the question. I visited Paris, Rome, Berlin, and the chief cities of Europe, where, frankly, fully, without reservation, my case, to use the medical term, was laid before the first physicians. These gentlemen subjected me to the severest examination— prosecuted the investigation without ceremony—and there is the result.” Ruthven pointed, as he spoke, to the paper, upon which were a few lines of writing in five different languages, signed by five of the first physicians of Europe. Of these languages, Dr. Vandyke was familiar with four — French, German, Italian, and Latin; and a perusal of the paper placed the fact beyond doubt that the man whom he regarded as a madman was considered perfectly sane by five of the most celebrated doctors of the Old World. The fact staggered him. “I see that you still doubt,” said Ruthven; “and, after all, doctor, authority, however great it may be, is still inconclusive, since the human mind is liable to error. Use, then, your own judgment. Madmen have a strange glitter of the eye—my eyes, I believe, are calm. Their expression is wild, roving —do you perceive aught of wildness in mine? They talk incoherently—do I? I reason, remember, love, and hate normally, and can be charged, I think, at worst, with being the victim of an absurd superstition. Can you tell me what human being is not irrational or superstitious upon some point?” Dr. Vandyke was more and more staggered. Lord Ruthven saw the advantage which he had gained, and resumed with ardor the strange conversation. “I speak to one who will understand me, and weigh my words in the scales of reason,” he said. “You and I, doctor, are not children, or shallow gossips talking neighborhood news. I would descend with you, if possible, into the depths of this profound subject, and endeavor to reach some just and rational conclusion. Is that rational?” And a sad smile came to the speaker's lips. “Yes; go on,” said Dr. Vandyke. “Well, to sum up in a few words. You hold in your hand evidence of the fact that the first savants of Europe regard me as a person of sound mind; neither in my eyes, my talk, nor my acts, do you perceive traces of aberration of mind, which, I need not tell so distinguished a physician as yourself, signifies divergence, either in diminution or excess, from the normal condition. What remains is this simple superstition of— let us speak plainly—second-sight; that is to say, the conviction that the future is revealed to certain persons in dreams. That is all—is it not?” “All,” said Dr. Vandyke. “Then I triumph! For, demand of your reading, your study, your observation, whether the world is not full of `vulgar errors'—if you choose to call this such. Is the peasant insane who believes that the hare running across his path brings bad fortune? Is the sailor insane who believes that Friday is an ill day for the commencement of his voyage? Is the Irish squire insane who believes that the banshee cries when Death is about to visit his household? All believe—are they necessarily insane therefore? Absurd, irrational, credulous, you may call them; but are they really insane?” “That's good sense, I grant you,” said Dr. Vandyke; “and your superstition—” “Was, doubtless, instilled into me by some old Highland crone, who believed in every thing and nothing. The child's mind is wax—doubtless, my own took the imprint.” Dr. Vandyke knit his brows. “And you yourself, then, consider all this second-sight business folly and moonshine?” he said. Ruthven's brows were knit in turn; and, with a strange, gloomy look, he said: “I know not! How ask a human being, the victim of superstition, if he is superstitious? I reason, simply—'tis for you to judge. And one of the elements of your decision must be the rational or irrational character of my reasoning.” “Judging thus, you are sane,” said Dr. Vandyke. “No pride of opinion shall prevent me from saying that. But —these stubborn buts!—tell me something more important.” “Speak, doctor.” “This second-sight—what is it?” “The future seen in vision,” replied Ruthven, in a low tone. “Seen clearly?” “Clearly!” “Recalled clearly when you awake?” “With absolute distinctness.” “All—faces, places?” “All!” said Ruthven, in a still lower voice. Dr. Vandyke nodded. “Now, but one thing remains,” he said—“to tell me what your vision, as you style it, has been in connection with—” He paused, looking at Ruthven, who was as pale as death. “Speak out,” the latter whispered. “In connection with Honoria Brand and Edmund Innis!” said Dr. Vandyke. Lord Ruthven breathed heavily, and made no reply. Fully five minutes elapsed before he could speak. Then he said, in an almost inaudible tone: “'Twas to tell you that, or to let you read something I have written, that I asked this interview.” “To read something?” “This!” And Ruthven drew from his breast the paper which he had written on that night at Williamsburg. Dr. Vandyke extended his hand to take it—his eyes blazing with curiosity — but Ruthven drew back. “A moment!” he said. “Before proceeding further, or intrusting this paper to you, I must exact a promise.” “What promise?” “That you will take no steps to obstruct my marriage!” “To obstruct your marriage?” “You may otherwise fancy that 'tis —desirable—to do so.” Dr. Vandyke looked gloomily at the speaker, whose cheeks had filled with blood. “And if I refuse to give this promise?” “Your perusal of this paper will be impossible!” “I will give no promise!” “So be it.” And Lord Ruthven restored the paper to his breast. “Stop!” said Dr. Vandyke, for his master - weakness, curiosity, overcame him. “What is it that you exact as a condition precedent to my reading your statement?” “That you shall take no steps whatever, in consequence of having come into possession of my secret.” “What steps do you speak of?” “Any steps!” “I am to remain silent, inactive— whatever I may read?” “Yes!” “Impossible!” Lord Ruthven inclined his head. “As you will, doctor. But, observe, that your ignorance is equally disadvantageous with your obligation.” “True,” muttered Dr. Vandyke. With a hesitating movement, he extended his hand. “Give it me!” he said. “You accept the condition?” “Yes!” “You swear upon your honor to remain silent, and to take no steps whatever to place an obstacle in the way of my marriage with Miss Brand, whatever you may read in this paper which I have written?” “I swear!” “Enough, sir. The word of a man like yourself is sufficient. Read!” And, unsealing the package, he extended it to Dr. Vandyke, who clutched it eagerly, and began to read by the light of the wax-candles in the silver candelabra on the tall mantel-piece. Lord Ruthven, meanwhile, remained erect near the mantel-piece, upon one of whose carved ledges he leaned his elbow. His face had resumed its deep pallor, and his dark eyes were half closed, the long lashes drooping toward the cheeks. As Dr. Vandyke proceeded with his perusal of the document, his countenance gradually lost its color, and his lips were closely compressed, or, opening, showed the large teeth set like iron beneath. When approaching the middle of the paper, these evidences of emotion became more marked and striking. Toward the end, every particle of blood faded from his face, his bosom labored with long breaths, and, suddenly finishing the paper, he whirled it from him, raised his head, and exclaimed, in hoarse, imperious tones—his frame shaking, his eyes blazing: “You have laid a trap for me! You are—! Oh! to exact that oath! Monstrous! But I will not be bound by it! Before I'll stand by, silent, and permit this marriage to proceed, I will—” Ruthven stooped, and drew from the trunk, in which Fergus had hidden it, the Highland dirk. “Here is the very weapon!” he said, in his deep voice. “Strike!” Dr. Vandyke drew a long breath, shuddering visibly. “You are mad, after all!” he muttered, hoarsely. “I am as sane as yourself!” “I will reveal the contents of this accursed paper!” “You dare not! You are bound by your word of gentleman!” “And you would have me permit this murderous—” Lord Ruthven extended his hand, and placed it on the physician's lips. “Your promise!” he said. Dr. Vandyke fell heavily into a chair, uttering a groan. Lord Ruthven quietly refolded the paper, sealed it again, placed it in a drawer of the table beside him, and said, coldly: “If any thing should happen, remember that the paper is there. 'Tis my vindication!” He shuddered as he uttered the words “if any thing should happen,” and looked for a moment at Dr. Vandyke in silence. “But, what can happen?” he continued, in a deep, firm, measured voice. “Do you think, sir, that I would not plunge this dirk into my heart before committing that crime? And ask yourself another question: What earthly motive could I have for this deed without a name? Men act from rational motives—except madmen; and you declare that I am not mad! What motive here? He has left the country; and, as to the other, what earthly motive could impel me to a deed at which my soul revolts? I love, adore, worship, this woman—I would lie down and die to save her from a moment's suffering! And yet—you think—you dream that I am capable— without motive, I say—without motive!” “Woe to you!” cried Dr. Vandyke, suddenly bounding up and confronting the speaker—“woe to you if you take one step toward the commission of this horror! I am old, but not weak; I would slay you with my own hand!” “And you would do right! I will not resist! But listen.” And he went close up to Dr. Vandyke. “I do not know,” he said, in a low voice, “if there be truth or no in this forewarning—if the devil will or will not tempt me to a crime without conceivable reason! But I am a free agent to a certain point. This horror will take place, if it takes place at all, at midnight. Well, neither at midnight, nor at any other hour between the marriage ceremony and dawn, shall my foot be placed in that chamber—do you hear, doctor?” Dr. Vandyke rose erect, and looked at the speaker with blazing eyes. “Swear it!” he said. Before Ruthven could reply, a knock was heard at the door, and Fergus entered. “They await you, my lord,” he said: “the bride is ready.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LII. UNDER THE OAK. During the progress of these scenes in private apartments of the large establishment, numerous guests had continued to arrive, and the night was full of noise. Chariot after chariot rolled up to the door, depositing portly old planters in huge ruffles, smiling old dames in silk and diamonds, and beautiful damsels in lace and satin, with pearls in their hair, and round arms sparkling with bracelets; with them came young gallants on spirited horses. All hastened in out of the cold; and the great mansion, blazing from garret to basement, was crowded with a gay company, from which rose an incessant buzz and uproar. The disagreeable scene at dinner was not alluded to; jest and merriment and laughter resounded; and the large assemblage, moving to and fro in the light of the chandelabra, was the picture of enjoyment. Such was the scene within. Without, the vast, wild landscape slept in its snowy shroud, and the night wind swept along—a ghostly thing on invisible wings —across the freezing expanse, to die away, with a low moan, in the dense evergreens. The moon had risen like a bloody shield, and, as it was rolled into the sky, poured upon the dreary waste a mournful and mysterious light, which rendered the snow more spectral, and the scene more forbidding. The lofty pines rose up like phantoms; and, at certain moments, the night wind, in their tufted heads, resembled the low cry of some creature perishing from cold, or calling for assistance against danger. The contrast between this sombre scene and that within Rivanna was startling. The company had all arrived; the drivers of the numerous vehicles were safely housed, like their masters, from the cold; and silence had settled down on the wild waste of snow, wrapping the whole earth as far as the eye could see. As the night advanced, there appeared on this chill expanse a single human figure—that of a man who leaped the enclosure of the grounds below the hill, crossed the expanse, with slow, meassured steps, and reached the large oak-tree beneath which Honoria and Innis had plighted their troth. Having reached this spot, the new-comer stopped, wrapped his cloak closely around his shoulders, and leaned against the trunk—whose shadow concealed him —looking intently, as he did so, toward the great mansion, blazing with lights.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LIII. THE APPOINTMENT. Honoria was standing before the mirror in her chamber, surrounded by the brilliant little beauties, her bridesmaids, who, having assiduously aided the young lady in making her toilet, now gazed at her with rapture. The sentiment seemed wholly unaffected. Honoria's exquisite but girlish beauty had suddenly taken to itself something cold and queenly, and it was only on a careful scrutiny that the rose in the cheeks was seen to be a hectic flush, and the calmness of the eyes that of utter despair. One person alone understood the young lady's feelings, and was not deceived by this ominous calmness — her mother. Lady Brand had assisted her daughter in dressing; had trembled at the thought of what she must pass through; and now gazed at her with deep anxiety. “Be calm, dear—this is well,” she said. “Come now, and sit down and rest before the ceremony.” “I am not tired, mother,” was the young lady's reply, “and my strength will not fail me.” Lady Brand shook her head sadly. “My poor, poor child!” she murmured, “you appear calm, but you are really feverish, agitated, laboring under nervous excitement.” A strange smile came to the young lady's lips. “Excitement!—oh, no! mamma, I am perfectly calm.” “At least come and sit down.” “I would rather stand, mamma.” Lady Brand sighed deeply. “But you must positively remain quiet: a few moments of privacy, to collect your thoughts, my child—” And Lady Brand looked at the bridesmaids, who, taking the hint, quietly left the apartment. As the last disappeared, mother and daughter exchanged a long look. But no alteration took place in the young lady's demeanor. She was still perfectly calm, but this, it was obvious, arose from a morbid state of mind. “My child,” exclaimed Lady Brand, “you are very, very unwell! Come, lean your head upon my bosom; it will rest and soothe you! You will remember, perhaps, the time when you were a little child, and dropped to sleep there.” The fond mother's arms were extended, but Honoria did not move. “O me!” she murmured. “I am not a child!—if I only were a little child again—!” “You are my child still, my own dear little one!” The words came with a burst of grief from the trembling lips. “Come—lean your head here!—it will rest you, my own Honoria!” But the young lady drew back, and the same strange smile again came to her lips. “Lean my head upon your breast, mamma!” she said, in a singular voice. “How can you propose such a thing? 'Twould spoil my bonny bridal curls and flowers.” As she spoke, she pointed to the snowy wreath above her long bridal veil, and began to sing in a low voice: “`Oh! the bonny, bonny bride, And the bonny, bonny flowers In her hair!”' The strange intonation of the girl's voice made her mother tremble. “Come, come, Honoria!” she exclaimed, in accents of displeasure, “this is out of place!” “What is out of place, mamma!” “This levity—this unnatural gayety. It belies your feelings.” “Belies my feelings, mamma?” “Yes, yes! Honoria — you never were so miserable!” “Miserable?” repeated the young lady, with the same strange smile on her lips, “why, what an idea! Am I not about to become the `happy bride' of a very great nobleman—to make a brilliant match, as every one says? I shall soon become my Lady Ruthven!—and what more silly than to feel miserable at being made a countess?” “My child—my child! Your voice is strange! You are not in your right senses!” “Why not, mamma—?” “Because I know your secret!—that you look with horror upon this marriage!” Honoria slowly and coldly shook her head. “With horror?” she said; “I look with horror upon my approaching marriage? Is such a thing conceivable, mamma? Would my father, who says that he loves me dearly, compel me to marry thus against my will? Could he possibly make his poor child so wretched? Could you—my own mother—!” Honoria suddenly stopped. Lady Brand had covered her face with both hands, and burst into tears. For a moment the girl looked at her in silence, and without moving. Then suddenly she ran to her, broke into a wild flood of weeping, and, throwing her arms around her mother's neck, cried: “O mamma! mamma! do not sob so! 'Twill break my poor heart! I was undutiful, unfeeling, to taunt you when 'tis not your fault! Forgive me, mamma!—no, I am not in my right senses— I am wretched—out of my head almost. This marriage is killing me, for I am going to perjure myself before God and man; but I will strive to bear all, and not make you more unhappy, mamma! Forgive me! forget my wicked words— I love you so dearly!” Clinging to Lady Brand, she buried her face in her mother's bosom, and sobbed until her agitated heart grew calmer. Tears had come to her at last, as a blessed relief—the burst of the tempest relieved her overcharged brain— and her mother saw, with delight, that the dull and apathetic look had disappeared from her eyes. Honoria was quite hopeless, but calm and resigned. “There, there, mamma,” she said, pressing her lips to her mother's cheek, “do not remember my wild, sinful words, and forget that I rebelled against God, and taunted you, when I ought to love and obey you, and treat you with respect. I am very unhappy, mamma, but —I will try not to wound you again. You see I am quite calm now, and—kiss me, mamma—I love you very, very dearly, and soon—shall—see you no more.” The head sank, and Honoria uttered a single sob. It was the last cry of her despair. Her mother could only whisper as she held her close: “God bless and keep my child, and give us both strength to bear this woe! for I know all, my daughter—I know, and am powerless as yourself. Come, now — dry your eyes, and summon all your courage, for the hour is near. Let me arrange your disordered hair; the idle crowd must not make their comments.” “Do not fear me,” said the young girl with sudden calmness and stateliness. “I know what my blood requires of me, and will not fail. And now will you do me a last favor, mamma? Leave me to myself for a few moments. I would be alone—have no fear, mamma; and do not ask me why.” Lady Brand looked intently at her daughter, and said: “Leave you alone?” The girl smiled sadly. “You fear I'll do myself some mischief, perchance! No, indeed! There need be no fear of that, mamma. I shall die of this marriage; but not now! Pray grant my request.” Lady Brand rose. “I will go, then, my child; but remember that your presence will soon be required.” With which words, she left the apartment. Honoria listened to the light, retreating steps; went quickly to the door; turned the key without noise in the ponderous old - fashioned lock; and then, hastening to a casket, unlocked it, took out a paper, and read it hurriedly by the lights on her toilet-table. The paper was a note, which a servant had brought on the day before, and ran as follows: “I am about to leave Virginia forever; but, before I go, I must see you once more, or die of despair. I cannot enter Rivanna, as one of the wedding-guests, and witness your marriage. That would kill me, or drive me to some act of madness which would but make you still more unhappy. Devise some other means—at the hour and spot you fix, I will be present. “These are calm words, are they not, for a man whose heart is breaking? But the hour to weep and rave is past, and I have no tears. “Farewell until we meet. “Edmund Innis.” In reply to this note, Honoria had written three lines, intrusting them to the servant, who saw no other member of the family, and left Rivanna as soon as he had received the reply: “I cannot escape from the company until to-morrow night — my wedding-night. Come, then, to the oak-tree— where—that day—O me! “Honoria.” Why had she written that note, forgetting the cold, the snow, the almost utter impossibility of keeping the appointment? She knew not; she only felt that she must see him once more, or die. She now hastily read the note of Innis again, and thrust it into her bosom. Then she sat down, clinched her hands together, and gazed into the fire. “I will go! — nothing shall fright me!—Edmund, Edmund!” Suddenly steps were heard in the passage, and a hand was laid upon the knob. Honoria calmly opened the door. Her sister had come to summon her. “I am ready,” she said.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">LIV. THE MARRIAGE. The moment had come for the performance of the marriage-ceremony. The crowd, filling the drawing-rooms, the hall, every foot of space, all at once ceased their uproar. A deep silence followed; and, in the midst of this silence, the rustle of satin trains was heard at the head of the staircase, like a breeze of summer rustling the long blades of corn. An instant afterward the imposing bridal party descended slowly, the bridesmaids leaning upon the arms of their groomsmen, the ample trains sweeping the polished oak of the staircase. The bride and groom came last. Honoria was very pale, but quite calm, and did not seem to require the arm of Lord Ruthven to support her, as she scarcely touched it with one of her little, white, gloved hands. She was superbly dressed, and wore a profusion of lace, hereditary in the family, with not a few jewels of great value. Her air was collected, and exhibited no emotion whatever. Lord Ruthven, on the contrary, evidently labored under very considerable agitation. He was paler even than the bride, and the smile which he endeavored to assume was so plainly forced that it was painful. Once, while descending the staircase, he turned his head quickly, and glanced with a singular expression over his right shoulder—a circumstance which was afterward spoken of, and commented upon in various ways. The bridal train entered the large drawing-room, where the reverend parson of the parish was standing in his black gown; and the bridesmaids and groomsmen, separating, and ranging themselves in two opposing lines, left an avenue open for the bride and groom, who slowly advanced and stood before the clergyman. Honoria retained her surprising calmness—a calmness far exceeding that of her companion—and the ceremony proceeded, Colonel Brand giving away the bride. At the injunction of the clergyman, that, if any one knew just cause why the ceremony should not take place, they should speak then, or forever after hold their peace, it was observed that Honoria half turned her head with a sudden look of fright, apparently dreading or expecting some interruption. None, however, took place; Honoria duly bowed her head, murmuring inaudibly the responses, and a prayer ended the ceremony. Honoria Brand had become the Countess of Ruthven. Then commenced the joyous uproar customary in Virginia upon wedding occasions. The young lady found her cold, pale lips saluted by her friends, and this evidence of regard was bestowed, even upon the bridesmaids, by all with the slightest claim, from consanguinity, to that privilege. Lord Ruthven received his share of the congratulations of the company—the low bows and impressive hand-shakings of the portly old nabobs, and the good wishes of the dames their partners—with profound courtesy and elaborate smiles. But it was plain that these smiles were forced. When left for a moment to himself, his countenance assumed a singular expression of haunting gloom; and twice he was observed to cast the strange, furtive glance over his right shoulder which had already attracted the attention of the guests. As the night drew on, and the hour of supper approached, Honoria was seen to look more than once toward the tall clock in the hall, and to glance sidewise through one of the great windows toward the lawn without. Her pale cheek was slightly tinged with blood, and the eyes, so apathetic throughout the ceremony, betrayed concealed agitation. At last her lips were compressed in a manner which seemed to indicate that she had formed some resolution; and, turning to her mother, who was standing near, she said: “Mamma, I am somewhat tired from standing too long. Make my excuses to any one who inquires for me; I will retire for a little while, but return soon.” “Very well, my dear,” said Lady Brand, who was not unwilling that the young lady should rest for a short time from her fatigue; “but do not stay long. Supper will be ready in half an hour.” “Yes, mamma, I will be ready.” And smiling upon the company, who made way for her, admiring as they did so her now rosy cheeks, Honoria went up the broad staircase to her chamber, in which she disappeared. The uproar in the great drawingroom had now become deafening; and perhaps this circumstance was, in no slight degree, to be attributed to the frequent visits of a large number of the guests to a small room in rear of the large hall, where stood, on a centre-table, an enormous punch-bowl, filled with arrack-punch, flanked by a mighty array of bottles containing mellow old Jamaica rum, brandies, and the richest vintages of sherry and canary. A huge silver ladle reposed in the punch-bowl, or, rather, was not permitted to do so for a moment by the festive visitors, holding out impatient tumblers; and two attentive servants, silent, rapid in their movements, and profoundly deferential, opened incessantly the wine bottles, and handed glasses to the old planters, who sipped in a stately way, and loomed above the more youthful company, the red and important old faces rising over masses of white neck-cloth and ruffles. In this room the crowd was continuous, the noise great; when the visitors returned to the drawing-room they smiled elaborately, and were communicative in the highest degree upon any and every subject. At last the old major-domo opened the door of the dining-room a few inches, and respectfully looked at Lady Brand, to signify that supper was ready. Lady Brand looked around for Honoria, but did not see her; and, saying to Lord Ruthven, as she passed him, “Supper is about to be announced, my lord,” she went into the dining-room, closing the door. Ruthven seemed to greet the announcement that supper was near—that is to say, that the trying evening was coming to an end—with deep satisfaction; and looked around for Honoria, to whom etiquette required that he should give his arm. She was nowhere to be seen; and, thinking that she might have gone out into the hall, from the great heat of the immense fire in the drawing-room, went thither to find her. But Honoria was not in the hall. A maid was passing at the moment, and, supposing that Honoria was in her chamber, Lord Ruthven directed the maid to go thither, and inform her mistress that the company was about to go in to supper. The maid hastened to obey, Lord Ruthven waiting her in the hall; but in a few minutes she returned with the information that the young lady was not in her chamber. “Not in her chamber?” exclaimed Lord Ruthven; “where, then, can she be?” The great front-door suddenly opened behind him as he spoke, and a person, who came in, heard the words. Lord Ruthven felt a hand laid upon his arm, and a low voice whispered in his ear: “Hush, my lord! — and come with me!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LV. THE STEPS IN THE SNOW. The voice was that of Fergus. Ruthven turned suddenly, and gazed at the old Highlander with undisguised astonishment and vague disquiet; and the expresssion of the ancient servitor's countenance was not calculated to dispel his emotion. The weather-beaten face was flushed, and the eyes of Fergus sparkled with wrath. His lips were compressed like iron, and the hand which he had laid upon his master's arm was so heavy and unceremonious—so indicative of forgetfulness of every form of respect—that Lord Ruthven felt his heart throb, his pulse give a great leap. “What is it?” he said, grasping the Highlander suddenly by the arm. “Hist! my lord—make no noise!” “Your meaning? You are no child!” exclaimed Ruthven; “you must have good reason for this abrupt address!” “I have; of that you shall judge! Follow me, my lord.” “Go on!” said Lord Ruthven. Fergus glided through the door; Ruthven followed, and it closed behind them. They had passed, in three steps, into another world, as it were. The sepulchral glare of the snow, bathed in icy moonlight, and the freezing wind, which cut like a sharp steel blade through the nobleman's thin silk coat, made the contrast between the warm apartments within and the frozen expanse without as striking as it was abrupt. But Ruthven did not heed it for an instant. A vague suspicion fired his frame, and sent the blood boiling to his cheeks. “Well!” he said to Fergus. “Follow me, my lord!” “Your object?” “To show you something—come?” Fergus went rapidly, as he spoke, down the broad steps; turned and followed the façade of the mansion; came in sight of a side-door, opening on the lawn, and, looking round, exclaimed: “Your lordship's married a bonny bride!” “What do you mean, I say! Speak!” cried Lord Ruthven, imperiously. “That will I, speedily, my lord. Where is the countess?” “I know not!” “I know.” “Where? Your meaning, Fergus? — Something in your words — your voice—!” “Yes, yes — your lordship is right. I have lost my coolness, even my respect; and yet, I must go further—I must exact a promise from your lordship!” “A promise! The meaning of all this? Speak if you would have me retain my senses!” “Promise that—you will not slay my lady.” “Slay!—you are mad!” 9 “I am in my senses—promise, my lord!” “I promise nothing, and I command you to explain your words! Speak! or, by Heaven, I'll tear your meaning out of your very heart!” And Ruthven seized the old servant by the throat, shaking him with such violence that he seemed about to strangle him. Fergus made no remonstrance whatever. He simply gasped for breath, and Ruthven released his grasp. “I obey your lordship, then,” said Fergus. “I've done my duty at least.” “Where is Lady Ruthven?” Fergus started down, and pointed to the snow. “Look, my lord!” he said. Ruthven looked, and saw the imprint of a small delicate slipper in the snow. “There is another!” said Fergus, in a low tone, “and another still. The person came out of that side-door; it has not been long since, you see, my lord, as the wind has not filled the tracks; and you can tell in which direction the person went. There are the steps!” His master no longer listened. With a burning cheek, and a heart which throbbed almost to bursting, Ruthven followed the delicate footsteps down the hill, the moonlight enabling him to do so without difficulty. Stooping and hastening onward, he resembled some wild animal crouching, and ready to spring upon his prey. Suddenly a cloud passed over the moon, and the dull glare of the snow barely afforded him the means of tracing the steps. It was sufficient, however, and Ruthven rapidly descended the slope, leaving the great gate far on his left. All at once a deep shadow fell upon the marks in the snow. He looked up and saw a great oak, distant twenty or thirty paces. At the same moment, the sound of voices was heard; and a voice which he recognized as that of Honoria murmured: “I will love you in life and death!” Ruthven's burning glance followed the direction of the sound, penetrated the shadow, and saw Honoria clasped in the arms of Edmund Innis.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LVI. THE LAST MEETING. Honoria had kept her appointment. Ascending the staircase rapidly, after speaking to Lady Brand, she had reached her chamber, wrapped a cloak around her, and descending by a flight of stairs in the rear of the hall—that which she had used on the night of the dumb-cake ceremony — had opened the side-door, gone forth into the freezing night, and hastened down the hill toward the great oak under which Innis awaited her. Flying, affrighted and trembling, over the snow which, at any other time, would have made her feet in thin satin slippers ache with cold, she had reached the tree, had seen the figure of Innis hasten toward her; and had fallen, weak, overwhelmed, and powerless to bear up under her emotion, into the outstretched arms of her lover. Then followed one of those scenes which the pen cannot describe, and the imagination only can form any conception of. Forgetting all the world besides —her past, her present, and her future —remembering only that the human being whom she loved with such unspeakable tenderness was before her; and obeying the resistless impulse driving her, like a weary, storm-lost dove, into his sheltering arms, she clung closely to him, clasped him wildly to her bosom, and exhausted on him every term of endearment, in one passionate outburst, which she made no effort to control. And Innis, broken-hearted and despairing, could only reply in broken words. His great woe came upon him at this last conclusive moment, with an intenser bitterness than ever before. The sense of what he had lost sent a chill to his very heart, and a cruel, mad despair was mingled with the delicious happiness of the girl's caresses. For many moments they thus remained, locked in each other's arms, murmuring words of endearment, and striving to control their passionate agitation. Innis was the first to succeed in this, and, choking down violently a groan which had risen to his pale lips, he said in a trembling voice: “I thank you for this last meeting, my own darling. I may call you so now —'tis the last time; and now you must go back; you must not stay here longer in this bitter cold! I felt as though I should have died without these few last words with you—these kisses you have given me—and now I can say farewell!” He tried to unclasp the arms of the girl, but she resisted. “Oh, no! no!” she exclaimed, in a voice interrupted by sobs, “we need not part so soon! Why must we part?” “They will miss you, and wonder at your absence; and this bitter night! Your poor, dear little feet in their thin slippers! — they will freeze! Yes, you must go, my darling; we must part now. I am calmer than I was; almost happy, dear. My heart was black with evil thoughts, with hatred, and all bitterness. I doubted God, and man, and woman. I was desperate, and meditated desperate things; but I have seen your dear, good face, my own Honoria; I have heard your voice, and I think I can bear my misery. Farewell, now—you must go; but tell me once more that you will not forget your poor cousin, however far away from you I may be; that you will pray for me, and try not to grieve over what might have been! Promise this, Honoria—my love—my lost love—and I shall be almost happy!” It was in reply to these words that Honoria, raising her head from his bosom, and letting it fall back upon his shoulder, had uttered in a murmur the words— “I will love you in life and death!” As the words escaped from her lips, the moon emerged from the black cloud which had concealed it, and Innis heard the sound of footsteps. He raised his head quickly, looked in the direction of the sound, and Honoria's eyes turned toward the same quarter. Lord Ruthven and Fergus were within a few paces of her, easily recognized by the moonlight; and with a low cry she fell back in the arms of Innis, and fainted upon his breast.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LVII. THE ADVERSARIES. Ruthves did not rush upon Innis, or, indeed, betray any evidence whatever of violent emotion. A sudden and strange calmness seemed to have succeeded his wild rage. He had apparently reached that stage when men grow pale instead of red, cold instead of violent; and when the mind, discarding all mere flurry and passion, decides coolly and in silence upon the course to be pursued. The deadly glance of the young nobleman's dark eyes, and the ashy pallor of his lips, alone indicated the depth of his wrath; his voice, when he spoke, was firm and measured. “It is quite unnecessary to hold me back,” he said to Fergus, who, knowing the terrible strength of his master's passions when they were once aroused, had seized his arm to restrain him from advancing farther. “I do not purpose doing any thing rash. Remove your hand from my arm, and remain where you now are, until you receive further orders from me.” Fergus released the grasp on his master's arm, and Ruthven advanced slowly and deliberately until he closely confronted Honoria and Innis. The latter had quickly regained his coolness, and returned Ruthven's fixed and icy glance with a look of the same description. “I will relieve you of Lady Ruthven, sir,” said the young nobleman; “as the night is unpleasantly cold, and in so thin a dress, she might suffer inconvenience from further exposure. I shall escort her ladyship to the house, and, as it will be necessary to have a brief discussion with you afterward, sir, shall beg you to await my return without moving from this place. May I count upon you, sir?” “You may, my lord!” returned Innis, in an ardent tone. There was no doubt of the intention of Ruthven. His eye said all; and Innis greeted the thought of mortal combat with his successful rival with a thrill of fierce satisfaction. As he spoke, Honoria opened her eyes, and returned to consciousness. Her glance met the cold eyes of Ruthven fixed upon her; she understood all; and suddenly exclaimed, in a tone of agony: “Oh, I am innocent of intended wrong!—It was but for a moment—one last meeting—I had to bid him good-by! —Edmund!—my lord—!” “Enough, madam!” said Ruthven, abruptly, a species of contortion passing over his dark face. “With your permission we will not discuss this subject further at present!” He advanced, as he spoke, took the young lady's hand, placed it upon his arm, and, exchanging with Innis a meaning glance, reconducted Honoria toward the house, followed by Fergus. No words were exchanged between the bridegroom and bride upon the way. Honoria was sobbing—from Ruthven's lips no sound issued. Following the steps in the snow, they reached the side-door, through which Honoria had gained the lawn. Here Ruthven stopped, and said: “As you doubtless desire to observe the proprieties, and avoid all scandal, madam, it will be best to enter by this door and gain your chamber. Supper is ready to be announced; and I will attend you at the foot of the great staircase.” Honoria bowed her head, and, replying only with a low sob, entered the side-door, and closed it behind her. Ruthven then went around to the front of the house, ascended the broad steps, carefully removed from his boots all traces of snow, and, opening the great door, entered. His entrance did not attract attention, and he had reached the thresh-hold of the drawing-room, when he encountered Colonel Brand. “We were looking for you, my lord, as supper is ready; and, strangely enough, Lady Ruthven also is not to be found.” “She has retired to her chamber, in all probability, sir.” “I think not.” And Colonel Brand turned to look for Lady Brand to ask. Time was thus afforded the young lady to reach her chamber, divest herself of her cloak, suppress her agitation, and descend. Lord Ruthven met her at the foot of the staircase, as he had promised, offered his arm, with a profound inclination; and, supper being announced at the same moment, the bridal party, followed by the guests, entered the great dining - room. The apartment was one blaze of lights, and this brilliant flood fell upon a table extending nearly the whole length of the room, and groaning with its burden of substantials and delicacies of every imaginable description. Meats, game, confections — each in a dozen varieties, and a dozen methods of serving—pyramids of cake, and exotic fruits, ices, jellies, and, on a side-table, coffee, tea, “strong-waters,” the richest wines— such formed a portion, and only a portion, of the entertainment offered by Colonel and Lady Brand to their guests. The crowd flocked in, noisy, joyous, full of laughter; and few paid any attention to the bride and groom. Those who did so, however, afterward spoke of Lord Ruthven's courtly attention to his bride. He waited upon her most assiduously; and, but for a strange glitter of the eyes, was the model of an overjoyed bridegroom. That metallic glitter was not inviting, it is true, and was afterward remembered; but, for the moment, all was joy and uproar. One person only was not so easily deceived. With eyes sharpened by tenderness for her daughter, Lady Brand saw the evidences of deep, suppressed emotion; and, knowing that Honoria had not been in her chamber ten minutes before her reappearance, sought an opportunity now to question her, and hear a solution of the mystery. This design of Lady Brand seemed, however, to be penetrated by Lord Ruthven, who persistently remained by Honoria, or returned instantly if forced to leave her; and when the fond mother, weary of this struggle of wits, addressed a plain question to the young lady, Ruthven replied, quickly, with a singular smile: “No, madam! I beg you will not insist upon your question. Your daughter is Lady Ruthven now, and is entitled to have her own secrets!” Lady Brand looked earnestly at the speaker, but his face was impenetrable. “Well, my lord,” she said, gloomily, “'tis for you to decide; but you will let me say that the augury is not happy when the bride begins by having secrets from her own mother.” Ruthven did not reply, and soon afterward the company began to move back toward the drawing-room, whither the bride and bridegroom led the way— Honoria pale and faint—Ruthven cold, firm, and impassive. Lord Ruthven led his bride to a seat near the fire, and then made her a low bow. With her permission, he said he would return to the supper-room; and, passing through the crowd, with a formal smile on his lips, he reached the hall. He did not go thence, however, to the supper-room, but to his chamber, where Fergus was seated, his elbows on his knees, his face sunk in his hands. “Come, quick!—the swords!” said Ruthven. “I have worn none to-night; but there are two of the same length!” Fergus faltered out: “Your lordship will not—! Think! after all, 'twas but—!” “Silence! — obey the order I give you! The dress-swords, and my cloak!” Dominated by the imperious voice and flaming eyes, Fergus drew from one of the trunks, with a trembling hand, two dress-swords, which Ruthven seized. The latter then threw a cloak around his shoulders, concealed the swords beneath it, and, saying imperiously to Fergus— “Remain here; I command you!” went hastily out of the room. He had taken notice of the position of the side-door, through which Honoria had reentered. This he now gained by the back staircase, for the moment quite deserted, opened the door, passed through, closed it behind him, and went rapidly down the hill toward the oak.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LVIII. THE COMBAT. Innis had not stirred from the spot. What thoughts had passed through the mind of the despairing young man, as he waited in the freezing cold, with Honoria's innocent kisses yet warm upon his lips, and a bloody combat with her husband imminent? Despair is a strange stimulant, and Innis had little hope left him in the world. Burnt up by harsh and gloomy emotion—seeing nothing in The Combat. p. 132. 505EAF. Image of two men struggling in a snowy forest. One man has dropped his sword, which is broken and slightly covered with snow, so he is desperately trying to wrench the other man's sword out of his hand. They are surrounded by winter trees, no leaves, and snowy ground. the future for him but hopeless misery— he greeted almost with joy the coming struggle, which would probably end his life and his woes together. That such a struggle was near he had no doubt whatever — a single combat with swords, doubtless; and as, like all young gentlemen at that time, he had been taught the use of the rapier, there would be no obstacle. Suddenly Ruthven's figure appeared in the moonlight. He almost rushed toward Innis, reached him, and exclaimed, in a hollow tone: “It is well, sir! You keep your word at least! You will not add cowardice to treachery!” “Treachery, sir!” cried Innis — “cowardice! Beware, sir! By Heaven, if you insult me thus, I'll throw myself, weaponless as I am, upon you, and tear you to pieces!” Ruthven threw back his cloak. “Here are two swords!” he said, “of equal length and good temper. You are not weaponless, sir, since one is for you!” And he hurled it at Innis's feet in the snow, his eyes burning with lurid fire. The young man stooped quickly, and caught it by the hilt. “Thanks!” he said; “this combat need not be delayed, then.” “No! here and now! Here, where—” And, with an expression of deadly menace, Lord Ruthven took a step, sword in hand, toward his enemy. “A moment, my lord!—there is time enough!” said Innis, in a cold and gloomy tone. “As one or both of us will probably be dead in an hour from this time, a few words are necessary.” “I want none! Defend yourself!” The sharp point glittered in front of the young man's breast; but he remained perfectly motionless. “I say that these words are necessary,” he replied, in the same gloomy tone. “What you mean by treachery I am unable to understand, sir! We were mere acquaintances—I never professed to be your bosom friend; and if there be wrong done, who is guilty of that wrong?” “Enough—!” “You shall hear me! and, as I may be driven to rage, I'll speak first of what is most important,” said Innis. “You are so ignorant of the person who is now Lady Ruthven, that you madly dream that she could be guilty of an impure action! That is the madness of jealousy, and suspicion, sir—naught else! Honoria is as pure as that snow; as the moon above you! Her sole fault, if it be a fault, has been her imprudence in granting me, to-night, at my urgent request, a few moments to say farewell, before we parted forever. I am about to leave Virginia—I loved her—you know that— I besought her to see me for an instant before I went; she was here for a little space, thus, at my own solicitation; and had you not come, the young lady and myself would have parted—” “With a last embrace! with kisses!— with caresses!—with `love in life and death!' Your sword, sir! This shall end!” “A single moment more, sir,” Innis replied, with the same immovable coldness, but a bitterness in his tone. “Your lordship is the lucky one, and can afford to listen an instant, if only to prevent misunderstanding when our ghosts meet in another world! Well, before she met you, Lady Ruthven was engaged to be married to me. You did not know that? 'Tis true, sir; and the circumstance was not so astonishing. We were cousins, had been playmates all our lives here at Rivanna; and before she went to Williamsburg, where she first saw you, plighted her faith to me here under this very oak-tree, where she came to bid me farewell to-night. That is a bitter memory to the poor, unhappy man who speaks to you—must it not be, sir? Well, I soon saw that Honoria was not to choose her mate. You paid your addresses, and I asked for her hand. Her father refused me—I was very poor; and accepted you. Did the young lady? And, in spite of all, I was going away, now—after these few words of farewell. “That is the history of three persons, sir—one happy, the other two miserable. As to this meeting, I repeat, sir, that it was my fault, and meant nothing. You speak of kisses—in Virginia, young ladies kiss kinsmen. I was this one's— she was innocent as an angel—do not give the devil that triumph of believing Honoria Brand other than purity itself! And now I've done, my lord. If there be fault in any one, the fault is mine. Spend your wrath on me; for that wrath I care nothing, as I care nothing for my life. Just now, when you used the word treachery, I wished to kill you. Now, you may kill me, if you choose, sir—my life is a matter of indifference to me, I am too miserable; but I charge you, on your honor as a gentleman, to absolve my cousin!” “Have you done, sir?” The brief, stern words range out suddenly, leaving no doubt of Ruthven's intention. His resolve was unshaken. Hatred, jealousy, blood-thirstiness — all this was written in his eyes. “Your lordship is bent on killing me, then?” said Innis, as coldly as before. Lord Ruthven's reply was to rush upon his adversary, and to lunge straight at his heart. Innis parried the blow; and a brief combat followed—bitter, desperate, breast to breast. Suddenly Innis's sword snapped, and the foes grappled and fell — Lord Ruthven beneath his adversary. They were body to body, face upon face, panting and bloody. Then Innis uttered a low cry, his hold relaxed, and he fell forward, a torrent of blood gushing from his bosom. Ruthven, who had retained his clutch of his sword, had shortened it quickly, and driven the point by main force into his adversary's breast. He rose, breathing heavily, and looked at the body lying on the bloody snow. All movement had ceased. “So much is done,” said the nobleman in a low, hollow voice; “now let me go back to my bonny bride!” His lip, writhed as he spoke, and the strange wild glitter of the eye was horrible. On this face, resembling a mask of Hate, was written a terrible resolution.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LIX. THE BRIDAL CHAMBER. It was now eleven o'clock, as all could see by the minute-hand of the great ghostly clock ticking in the hall, and the wedding-guests began to take their departure with many congratulations, addressed to Lord Ruthven and his bride, who stood beside colonel and Lady Brand in the middle of the drawing-room. Lord Ruthven was fearfully pale, and the strange glitter of his eyes had not disappeared. He had gained his chamber by the door in the rear, divested himself of his cloak, and descended just as Dr. Vandyke disappeared through a door leading to Meta's chamber, whither he had been summoned hastily by intelligence that the child had been taken suddenly ill. A terrible smile passed across Ruthven's pale lips, as the physician disappeared, and he hastened to join the company. The leave - taking was gone through with, and the guests entered their coaches awaiting them in front of the portico. A quarter of an hour afterward the last chariot had rolled away from the door; the members of the household retired; and the great mansion, lately so noisy and brilliant, was as still and dark as a haunted house, from which all human occupants have fled, leaving it to the mysterious tenants of the darkness. In this profound and almost painful silence, no sound was heard but the subdued murmur of the river beyond the pine-clad hill, and the measured ticking of the tall clock in the hall; no light was visible but the spectral gleam of the setting moon, which, passing through a narrow window in front of the great door, lit up the white dial-plate of the clock, making it resemble a ghost. Slowly the “tick—tick,” resounded with a dull, monotonous sound, through the deserted hall—slowly the black hand moved over the white face, second after second, minute after minute. “Tick, tick!—tick, tick!” It was ten minutes of midnight now. The hand crawled slowly, the monotonous sound went on, never faster, never slower, like a metallic fate, careless of what was near at hand. “Tick, tick!—tick! tick!” It was five minutes of midnight now —four minutes—three minutes— The last rays of the moon, dim, mysterious, bloody, were on the ghostly face: the black hand was on the stroke of midnight, when a door opened violently in the direction of Meta's chamber, and Dr. Vandyke rushed into the vacant hall. At the same instant, a sudden and terrible scream issued from the chamber of Lady Ruthven. The clock struck midnight. As the hammer fell, the door of the bride's chamber opened violently, a dark figure rushed down the staircase nearly overturning the physician, who vainly attempted to grapple with and arrest it— the great door opened and closed with a clash; and past the window of the bridal chamber—past the delicate footprints in the snow—past the oak where a dusky object was stiffening in the freezing winter night—past tree and rock, lit up by the bloody light of the sinking moon— the dark figure, followed headlong now by another figure, disappeared in the gloomy night. The second figure was that of Fergus, who, issuing forth from the side-door of the mansion, had hastened with the speed of a deer upon the track of his master. The fearful scream from Lady Ruthven's chamber had aroused the entire household. In a few minutes, the upper hall was filled with trembling figures in night - dresses uttering cries, and demanding the origin of the alarm. Through the agitated group, Lady Brand, wrapped in her dressing - robe, hurried to Honoria's chamber, her heart throbbing violently, her cheeks as pale as ashes. Through the door-way came a hollow moan. She hastened into the chamber, only illumined by a few chance gleams of the dying fire, and the last red rays of the moon; and, as she did so, heard the low words— “Mother! mother!” Suddenly she felt her bare feet—for in her haste she had not put on her slippers—touch something moist. She stooped—touched the floor—and held up her finger. It was blood. With a wild, awful cry, she called for lights. They were all ready at the door in the hands of the affrighted household; and a spectacle of unspeakable horror was revealed to all eyes. Lady Ruthven was extended upon the couch, which it was obvious she only had occupied — her head hanging back like a wounded bird's, the bosom of her snowy night-dress stained with blood— and the flow of blood had been so profuse that, lying as she did upon the edge of the bed, it had reached the floor, and extended in a long, narrow stream toward the chair before the fire, upon which the young lady had deposited her garments when she retired. The awful climax to this scene of horror was the hilt of a Highland dirk clearly relieved against the white night-dress, and buried apparently in the young lady's bosom. Beneath the head of the young lady was passed the arm of Dr. Vandyke, who, divining in an instant, as Ruthven darted by him, what had happened, had hastened to the chamber and the bedside. “O doctor!—what is this?” cried Lady Brand. “Murder, madam!” was the hoarse reply. Lady Brand, with a low cry, extended her arms toward her child, tottered, and would have fallen, had not Colonel Brand, who hastily entered at the moment, caught her in his arms. Such was the spectacle in the bridal chamber. But the family were destined on this night to sup full on horror. Colonel Brand, nearly unmanned, bore his wife to a couch, and had just deposited the apparently lifeless form thereon, when violent knocking was heard at the great door of the mansion, and voices loudly demanded admittance. A shudder ran through the crowd, and every one listened. The violent knocking continued — there was in its very sound something urgent and terrible — and, seizing a flambeau, Colonel Brand, ashy pale and with compressed lips, hastened down the staircase, threw open the door, and, holding the flambeau aloft, demanded the occasion of the outcry. No reply was necessary. Borne in the arms of two servants, he saw the body of Edmund Innis—the face deadly pale, the eyes closed, the bosom covered with blood. The servants, chancing to pass by the great oak, on their way to the quarters, had been startled by a groan — fled with superstitious fear at first; but, summoning courage, had re turned to the spot, and discovered Innis stretched in a pool of blood upon the snow. They had hastily raised him— borne him between them to the “great house,” and knocked loudly at the door to summon assistance. Colonel Brand uttered a low groan, as the servants explained in hurried words how and where they had found the body. He could only gasp out an order that the dying man should be brought in. He then went back, wellnigh broken-hearted, to his daughter's chamber. As he crossed the threshold, he staggered in his gait, but all at once his eyes expanded with a sort of joy. Lady Brand was holding the head of Honoria upon her bosom, and the young lady was sobbing. Dr. Vandyke, crouching down, was rapidly applying bandages to the wound. On the floor, whither he had hurled it, lay a hideous object — the bloody weapon drawn by the physician from the body of the girl. It had not entered her bosom, toward which the murderous hand had no doubt directed it—it slipped, or the hand was unsteady; the point had only pierced the white arm beneath the shoulder. A profuse flow of blood had taken place, but the wound was merely dangerous, not necessarily mortal; and, under the skilful hand of Dr. Vandyke, the blood soon ceased to flow. In a few words, Colonel Brand informed Dr. Vandyke of the discovery of Innis's body. A start and a strange glance greeted the intelligence of this additional tragedy. “The devil is let loose, then!” he muttered, in his harsh metallic voice—“both fulfilled to the letter!” And, with these singular words, the physician turned and said: “Honoria is easy for the present. Where is he—Edmund Innis?” He was conducted to the chamber, where the young man had been laid upon a bed, nearly but not quite insensible. “A hideous business, truly!” muttered the physician, tearing away the clothes from the young man's breast, and examining the wound, around which the blood had coagulated in the intensely cold night. “This one will die, I think —the lung pierced—” He called for hot water, washed the wound, bandaged it, and, giving directions to an old nurse to remain with Innis, went back to Honoria's chamber. All eyes were turned toward him, including Honoria's, who breathed regularly now. “A bad wound, but not mortal,” he said; “and now this young lady must go to sleep. All will please leave this chamber but Lady Brand.” The agitated group disappeared, Dr. Vandyke going out last with Colonel Brand. As the door closed, their eyes met. “The meaning of all this! the meaning, doctor?” groaned the colonel, ghastly pale. “Simple,” was the reply. “Your daughter married, as I told you, a madman.” “Good Heavens! — and — this poor boy—?” “They fought, or the madman struck him in the dark.” “And—?” “Will he die, you mean?” “Yes, yes!” “In three days. Honoria's hurt is slight, comparatively. The boy's is mortal. I give him three days!” An hour afterward, a further discovery was made, which put the finishing touch to this night of horrors. What had become of Lord Ruthven and his body-servant? Dr. Vandyke recalled the violent collision with Lord Ruthven on the staircase, as he rushed toward the front-door; and the servants who had discovered the body of Innis, reported that they had seen two dark fig ures—one apparently in pursuit of the other—hastening in the direction of the hills skirting the river. This intelligence left little doubt that Lord Ruthven had attempted or committed suicide; and a party, supplied with torches, followed the footsteps, plain in the snow, toward the point in question. The steps were evidently those of Lord Ruthven and his servant, whose ponderous boots had left very different traces from those of his master. The double footprints crossed the snow-covered expanse of the lawn—led by the oak where the combat had taken place — were traced on the other side of the enclosure around the grounds, through the melancholy wilderness of evergreens beyond, and ceased abruptly upon the summit of a rock, beneath which the river — hemmed in between high banks—rushed with great rapidity through its deep and narrow channel. Here, on the brink of the awful precipice —to use the very words of Lord Ruthven, uttered to Fergus at Williamsburg —were found the traces apparently of a violent struggle. The snow was trampled and the footprints of master and servant were clearly distinguishable, intermingled in such a manner as to leave little doubt that they had grappled with each other. The fact was plain that both had fallen or thrown themselves into the stream; and this proved to be the truth. Two hundred yards down the bank, the bodies of Lord Ruthven and Fergus were discovered—both were dead—the arms of the clansman clasping his chieftain, as though he had died in the effort to save him. This was all that was ever known. Had the two committed suicide? Or, in the struggle, had they fallen into the rushing stream, and been drowned? There was no means of determining the question. The bodies were borne back to Rivanna. On the next day they were interred side by side in the graveyard attached to the parish church some miles distant. Death had thus not separated them, and Fergus lay where he would have chosen, beside his master.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LX. THE STATEMENT AND THE PAPER. Nothing, in reference to the events of this fearful night, between the moment when Honoria retired to the time when her screams aroused the household, was ever accurately known, except by three persons. These persons bound themselves, it is said, by a solemn obligation, not to speak upon so painful and terrible a subject. But, in spite of that fact, a rumor, in time, began to creep about. Some indiscreet listener had overheard, perchance, some words uttered in supposed privacy; and, link by link, detail by detail, the mystery was, or professed to be, revealed. This whispered rumor, for want of better information, is here given. Of its accuracy, the reader will form his own opinion. Honoria's statement was, that she had retired, on her wedding-night, at a quarter-past eleven; a fact which she remembered, as she had glanced at the clock in the hall as she went toward the great staircase. She was, at this hour, completely exhausted, and nearly sunk down from pure weakness and agitation, as her bridesmaids assisted her in making her night-toilet. The young ladies had then left her apartment; she retired to bed, fell into a morbid state, half sleeping, half waking; but was suddenly aroused by a horrible breathing, apparently issuing from behind the curtains of her bed, identical with that heard on the night when she had performed the ceremony of eating the dumb-cake. This sound, she stated, filled her with such fright that she nearly fainted, and only remembered what followed, as human beings remember dreams. She saw, or fancied she saw, the fire slowly die away, and darkness invade the chamber. The only light now was that of the blood-red moon, which shone through the western window, throwing upon the opposite wall the shadow of one of the boughs of the great oak opposite the window; and this shadow, as before, assumed the appearance of a gigantic arm, the hand grasping a dagger. From this moment she recalled little, and that as a sort of dream, full of terror. Lord Ruthven seemed to stand at her bedside, his face as pale as death, his lips writhing, and his eyes fearfully bright. In his hand he grasped a dagger, such as she had seen in the dumb-cake dream, and exclaiming, in a hollow tone, “False! false! false!” he had crouched, lifted his arm; the weapon had gleamed in the red moonlight, and a hot iron seemed suddenly to pass through her shoulder, whereupon she had lost consciousness, only to be aroused by the entrance of her mother. Such was the narrative attributed to the young lady, and there was little reason to discredit it, with the exception of the asserted identity between the real poniard which had inflicted the wound, and that seen in the dream on the night of the dumb-cake. That Honoria believed the two to be identical in appearance is certain. When the weapon was shown to her she swooned, and, as soon as she opened her eyes, begged those around her to remove it, as she had seen it before. It is certain, at least, that this idea of the identity of the real and fanciful weapon had taken strong possession of the young lady's mind; and a paper, discovered in a drawer of the chamber occupied by Lord Ruthven, directed to Colonel Brand, is said to have strongly corroborated this strange idea. To this paper—which was the same shown by Lord Ruthven to Dr. Vandyke —we now pass. For reasons, of which he declared himself, in brief words, to be the best judge, Colonel Brand, after reading this paper, proceeded at once to destroy it by holding it in the flame of a candle until it was reduced to ashes. He never afterward alluded to it to any member of his household; but, either through himself or through Dr. Vandyke, its purport became known, or professed to be known. Here, as before, recourse must be had to rumor—that ambiguous but often accurate version of secret occurrences which so frequently creeps about. It was said that, in this paper, Lord Ruthven sought to vindicate himself in advance from the charge of blood-thirstiness, in the event of the commission by himself of a terrible crime. In order to thus relieve his memory of a portion at least of the guilt, he presented a history of his life. He declared himself to be the representative of an ancient Scottish family, which had possessed, time out of mind, the fearful gift of the “second-sight”—a faculty which enabled them to look into the future, and thus foresee the events of their own lives. The consciousness of this fatal gift had, he declared, afforded him, from his earliest years, unspeakable wretchedness. His character had been naturally genial and cheerful; this fearful faculty had made him harsh, irritable, and melancholy. He had struggled long and obstinately to divert his mind of all belief in it—had striven to laugh at it as an absurd superstition, instilled into him by the old Highland crone who had nursed him, and told him frightful stories from his cradle; but all was vain. The fearful proof was there to falsify his hopes. In his dreams he had foreseen events which duly and literally came to pass, in spite of every effort which he made to prevent their occurrence. This was the terrible part. He could not re sist this secret fate, driving him to fulfil the visions. Of this statement, Lord Ruthven presented several instances. He had had a favorite hound. A vision told him that the hound would perish by his hand, and to avoid this painful event he had presented the animal to a neighboring friend, with the injunction to keep him out of his ?Lord Ruthven's? sight. The hound had, nevertheless, perished by his own knife. He was deer-hunting—the animal was driven to bay, and he had dismounted and thrown himself upon the stag, struggling with the dogs, couteau de chasse in hand, and struck at his throat. Instead of the deer's throat, the knife entered the breast of one of the dogs. It was his favorite, who, hearing the cry of his old companions on the hills, had joined in the hunt, and thus met his death, in accordance with the vision. A second instance was similar. He had a riding-horse of great beauty and speed, though so violent at times that he was dangerous. He was his favorite of the whole stud; and when he one night had a vision, in which he saw himself shoot the animal dead, he awoke depressed and sorrowful. This time he swore to disappoint the devil; and, without delay, sent the animal by a reliable groom to an English nobleman, his friend, residing more than three hundred miles distant, requesting him to accept the horse. A note of thanks for so fine an animal came back. Ruthven forgot the incident; but a year afterward was visiting in Perthshire, when, in a paddock attached to the mansion of his host, he saw the horse, dragging a groom by the bridle and pawing at him. Whence had the animal come? he asked. The reply was that Lord — was coming for the hunting-season, and had sent this horse to await his arrival. This explanation had scarcely been given, when the groom was thrown to the earth, and the animal tore him with his teeth, and rose on his hind-legs to paw him to death. Ruthven was just going out grouse-shooting, and had his fowling-piece in his hand. It was a choice between the life of the man and the life of the horse. He discharged the contents of his fowling-piece into the animal behind the shoulder—he rolled over, tore up the grass with his teeth, and expired. The man was saved; but Ruthven returned to the house, bade his friend farewell, and went back sorrowfully to his castle. He had fulfilled the second vision. This had made him wellnigh lose all hope, and surrender himself to despair. But a blessed discontinuance of the visions succeeded. For many years he slept tranquilly—saw nothing—and began to hope that Heaven had mercifully exempted him from further torture. The visions came no more; he attained the age of twenty-five—when all at once he began to see vaguely the forms of a young man and a young lady, in connection with whom some terrible event was to occur, in which event he was to act the chief part. Filled with horror at this vague ?and more frightful because vague? vision, he determined to leave Scotland; and that for a double reason. The popular belief in connection with the fearful gift of second-sight was, that those afflicted with it had only to leave their own land and travel, to lose the faculty. This was the main reason inducing him to resolve upon a prolonged absence from Scotland. Another was to seek in travel, society, cards, dissipation, if necessary, relief from his frightful visions. Still a third reason for visiting the Continent was to allay a foreboding, which had for some time chilled him—the fancy that, perhaps, after all, he was simply a person of unsound mind—the apparent fulfilment of his visions, in the cases of the dog and the horse, being only coincidences. In accordance with the resolution formed, he left Scotland, went to Paris, plunged into gay society, and found his visions disappear. The question of his sanity remained; and he laid his “case,” without reservation or concealment of any description, before some of the most celebrated physicians of Europe, who declared, over their own names, in a written paper, that Lord Ruthven was, in their opinion, a person of somewhat morbid and excitable organization, but, in point of sanity or insanity of mind, no more insane than themselves. This had proved an enormous relief to him. Then, he was simply “excitable”—torturing himself with “morbid” fancies; the second-sight was a chimera! He would, therefore, return home, and laugh at his visions. This resolution was followed by a return to Scotland. For a brief time, no visions disturbed him; but then they returned in a more aggravated form than before. The vagueness had now quite disappeared—all was clear-cut, and distinct. He saw a young man and a young lady whose blood was to be shed by himself. The young lady was to be his bride—the young gentleman was his unsuccessful rival. They were to inhabit a region diversified by mountains—those of Scotland, apparently. The tragedy was to grow out of the preference of the young lady for his poorer rival. She was to prove false to him by granting, on his very wedding-night, a stolen and criminal interview to this rival. They were to fight in the snow—the rival was to fall; then, he, Ruthven, was to go to the bridal chamber, strike his Highland dirk into the bosom of the bride; and afterward commit self-destruction by throwing himself from a precipice, crowned with evergreens, into a swollen torrent. Such was to be his fate—this was his future: love, murder, and suicide! In unutterable horror, he determined to fly from Scotland, which he supposed to be the scene of the future tragedy— for the precipice, the evergreens, the swollen torrent, all seemed to indicate, with sufficient exactness, the locality. This time he resolved that he would cheat Fate itself of its prey: he would leave the accursed scene of future crime forever. An opportunity to do so unexpectedly presented itself. His friend Lord Botetourt was appointed Governor of Virginia — beyond the ocean was safety. He at once applied for permission to join the suite of the new governor—readily received it; sailed for Virginia; and breathed freely once more, with the delightful consciousness that he had outrun the haunting Fate. His comfort was short-lived. Riding one day at full gallop along Gloucester Street, in Williamsburg, his horse had shied suddenly; he was unseated and fell —losing his senses by the fall. When he regained consciousness, he saw before him the young gentleman seen in his vision in Scotland! The sight of the youth overcame him with horror; and he had but one hope—that this was a coincidence only; that he had met with this young gentleman, Mr. Innis, in Europe, and hence the recognition of him. He had accordingly questioned him, and discovered that no such meeting could have taken place, as Mr. Innis had never visited Europe—thus he was certain that they had never before met. Upon this discovery, his resolution was promptly taken. As Virginia was to be the scene of his crime, he would instantly leave the country, as he had left Scotland; and he gave prompt orders to have his trunks gotten ready for his departure. The departure had not taken place. First, there was a difficulty about a vessel; then the governor begged him to delay; then Mr. Innis left Williamsburg, and all danger for the moment was plainly over. The second identification followed. At the governor's assembly he saw enter the room the young lady of his vision— his bride and victim to be. Thereat his horror had been overwhelming. He sought to avoid even an introduction to her; but circumstances rendered it necessary; he had danced with her, visited her, conceived an ardent passion for her; and thus completely lost the power of leaving her. He had not sufficient strength to do so; but soothed his agitation, at thought of the vision, by swearing that he would put an end to his own life, before he would do harm to the young girl whom he loved so dearly. Thenceforward things took their course. He proposed for Honoria's hand, was accepted by her father, the time was fixed —and, to crown his happiness, Mr. Innis, the unsuccessful lover of the young lady, was perfectly resigned to his fate, and about to leave the country. Thus, the hated visions were a cheat—second-sight a farce, after all—he would be happily married, do harm to no one, and, in the sunshine of love, forget all his past sorrows. But, if his Fate still hunted him down —if some hidden hand drove him on to conceive the possibility of such crimes as he had seen himself commit, he would stop on the threshold, perish by his own hand; and this paper, addressed to Colonel Brand, would be the explanation and vindication of the tragedy. Such were the alleged contents of Lord Ruthven's narrative. How the terrible sequel was brought about has been recorded.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">EPILOGUE. For three months the life of Innis seemed suspended by a hair, which the hand of a child—the least breath—would break. His wound then began slowly to heal, and, in the last days of May, he rose, pale, thin, and tottering, from his bed, entering the world thus once more, as it were, from the postern of the grave. Honoria had completely recovered from her wound some time before; and the terrible events of her wedding-night began to relax their painful hold upon her mind. She looked back now to those events as to a fearful dream, from which she had awakened; and the May sunshine saw the roses once more blooming in her cheeks. That she and Innis were married in due time, we need scarcely assure the reader. Of the will of Colonel Seaton there was no question at all. Colonel Brand had duly recorded it in the proper court, surrendered Rivanna to Innis, gave him the hand of Honoria—and all lived in peace and harmony under a single roof. On the night of Honoria's marriage to Innis, Miss Lou Brand bestowed her queenly hand upon Mr. Phil Cary. It was a happy double wedding, and even Mrs. Cary, who was present, and in the seat of honor, was overjoyed at the happiness of her son. Side by side, near the married couples, stood two persons who have frequently appeared in this history—Meta and Dr. Vandyke. With the termination of the tragedy, so long overshadowing Rivanna, Meta had begun to recover her strength, and to regain the roses in her cheeks. It seemed a miracle, this return to life, and, what was far better than life, the blessed light of reason. No more, now, a subtle, scheming, mad girl, burnt up by a morbid jealousy, but a gentle and tender woman, moved by all sweet influences and kindly emotions, Meta stood beside Honoria, as one of her bridesmaids, smiling and beautiful—in her dark curls the spring flowers she thought she should never more see. And Dr. Vandyke—the cynical, bitter, large-hearted, profound, and clownish personage—Dr. Vandyke had come all the way from Williamsburg to be present at the wedding, which he had contemplated with a grin, and spiced with an allusion to Mrs. Snuffers, a venerable personage, whom he believed to be bent on marrying him. As the night drew on, and the long hours fled by like birds into the darkness, the wit and satire of Dr. Vandyke sparkled more and more. Beside the great punch-bowl, and occasionally waving the ladle around his head, he resembled some eccentric goblin, and there was something weird about his laughter. But, toward midnight this merriment disappeared—the face of this strange man grew deeply sorrowful. With his eyes fixed upon the great clock, whose hand approached twelve, the doctor fell into a reverie, and sighed. Phil Cary laid a hand upon his shoulder, and cried: “What are you thinking of, doctor?” Dr. Vandyke uttered a deeper sigh than before. “Poor Ruthven!” he muttered. THE END.</field>

Paper. 75 cents; 12mo, cloth, ?1 50 “Good-bye, Sweetheart!” is certainly one of the brightest and most entertaining novels that has appeared for many years. The heroine of the story, Lenore, is really an original character, drawn only as a woman could draw her, who had looked deeply into the mysterious recesses of the feminine heart. She is a creation totally beyond the scope of a man's pen, unless it were the pen of Shakespeare. Her beauty, her wilfulness, her caprice, her love, and her sorrow, are depicted with marvellous skill, and invested with an interest of which the reader never becomes weary. Miss Broughton, in this work, has made an immense advance on her other stories, clever as those are. Her sketches of scenery and of interiors, though brief, are eminently graphic, and the dialogue is always sparkling and witty. The incidents, though sometimes startling and unexpected, are very natural, and the characters and story, from the beginning to the end, strongly enchain the attention of the reader. Opinions of the Press on “Red as a Rose is She.” From the Boston Traveller. “After reading such a work, one can no more read an ordinary book than one could enjoy a lunch on dry bread immediately after having dined on curry and Chili, washed down with burnt brandy.” From the Baltimore Gazette. “The eleverest novel of the season. The characters are few, but remarkably well drawn; the dialogue fresh, crisp, and sparkling, and the incidents thoroughly natural.” Either of the above sent free, by mail, to any part of the United States.</field>
