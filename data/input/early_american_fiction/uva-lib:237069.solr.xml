      <field name="fulltext">ELLEN HART. CHAPTER I. The bell in the tower of the `Old South' church was tolling heavily and loud the strokes for nine o'clock, as a Watchman came upon his `beat on the corner of W — Place. It was a cold, cloudy night, late in November, and his large box-coat was closely buttoned up to his throat and his winter cap drawn low over his ears and forehead. With his rattle hanging upon his wrist and a short club in his grasp he began to pace his round into Summer street. The wind came howling through the cross avenues of the town westward, causing the passengers on the walks to bend low to it and with the cape of the cloak shield their faces from its piercing effects.— The street lamps burned more brightly than usual in the clear atmosphere, but at intervals, agitated by the wind which found its way through the frame of the lantern, would flicker and cast dancing shadows across the streets and along the side-walks. Ashy-hued clouds were driving along the gloomy sky, opening now and then to let a star shine through for an instaut and then disappear. Few persons were in the streets and the hacks and cabs that passed, went at a furious rate over the icy ground, as if the drivers were willing to exchange as soon as possible their bleak elevation for a seat in the warm bar-room adjoining their `stand.' The watchman passed half-way up the `Place,' and mid-way met his comrade advancing, as warmly muffled against the cold as himself. `A stiff night, Maxwell,' said his companion. `It will shut up the harbor! I have not known so cold a snap at this season for years,' responded the other. `The poor will feel it.' `Yes; and rogues will keep in, for they are most of them too ill-clad to stand this weather;' answered Maxwell with a laugh. `The keenest will only be abroad and we must keep the better watch.' `The cold will keep me stirring,' growled the other. `It is worth a man's life to sit down five minutes. He'd never get up again! See how comfortabte it looks in that parlor! It's the rich this world was made for after all. Now, that man who lives there, because he is rich, can stay at home with his family and enjoy himself, while we, because we are poor men, must leave our wives and children and be abroad in such a night as this to watch his house! This is a rich man's world, and poor folks have no business in it.' `You have no cause to complain,' said Echardt, with a German accent, `for your situation is much better than that of thousands in this city. To hundreds of poor devils you and I are rich and envied! Look at that poor man and his wife now with their little girl!' and he pointed to a miserably clad man carrying on his shoulder fragments of some old fence, followed by a woman, her feet incased in an old pair of men's boots and dressed in a thin ragged gown accompanied by a barefooted little child, both tottering under a load of miserable fire-wood gathered in vacant lots, and both looking, as doubtless they were, half frozen to death. Maxwell turned and looked after them as they went shivering past, one behind the other, and then replied, `You are right, Echardt. I am wrong to complain. My lot is a good one. That might have been me, my wife and my child! God's mercies we all ought to be thankful for!' `So we ought; and if every man who was discontented would feel so, there would be less complaining and a great deal more happiness. It is not riches or a large fine house, or a carriage and such things that make men happy. We must carry our happiness about with us in our bosoms. A contented spirit is better than Jacob Astor's wealth. Now, much as you envy Mr. Hart, who lives in this elegant house,' he said, glancing at the windows of the handsome mansion, the lights within reflecting a rich crimson glow through the closely drawn curtains, speaking of domestic comfort combined with elegance, taste and wealth; `happy as you think he is, I have no doubt if we both knew the truth, we should find that he was very far from being as happy as you or I.' `Perhaps not,' answered the other; `but there is a poor shivering creature who has seated herself on the steps as if she would get warmth by gazing into the warm-looking windows. I must start her up, or she will freeze to stone there. Poor thing!' `And so many houses—so many rooms—so many beds—so many fire-places with plenty of room around them as there are in this great city, and yet here is a poor woman who has to wander the streets. It is a shame to human nature!' `It is so; but it has always been so and always will be so! Go on your rounds. I will take care of her, Echart,' said Maxwell. The other watchman then continued his walk, beating his feet to keep the blood in circulation, while Maxwell approached the woman who had seated herself on the steps of the rich man's house. `Come, come, good woman! You must'nt sit here,' he said in a firm but kind voice.— `Have you no home to go to?' She was clad in a calico gown, an old handkerchief and a wretched hood! By the light of a street lamp he saw that her naked feet were thrust into an old pair of hotel slippers. He could not see her features. He repeated his question. `No,' she answered in a faint voice. `Then go with me to the watch-house. You will find at least a fire and a cot there!' He took her by the arm and was about to lead her away from the step when a gentleman, enveloped to the eyes in the folds of a Spanish cloak, came up and pausing said, `What is the matter, Maxwell, for I believe this is you!' `A poor woman, Mr. Hart, who was sitting on your steps where she would soon have got stiff. She says she has no home and I am taking her to the watch-house.' `Please, sir, give me a little something? asked the woman. `You are always at your post, Maxwell. That's right, never let the vagabonds be about!' `Please, sir.' `I have nothing for you,' he answered coldly; and passing her by he entered his dwelling, while the watchman led off the poor woma. This uncharitable person was a merchant of eminence. His name was Henry Hart. He had been the maker of his own fortune, and lived in a style of magnificence commensurate with his income. He had accumulated his wealth on the miser's principle, that pennies grew to pounds. He never gave away money, he loved it for itself and for the consideration it gave him among men. He was nevertheless liberal in expenditure where himself and his family were interested. He had an excellent wife, both lovely and accomplished. At the time he is now introduced to the reader he had been sixteen years married, and had five children, the eldest being a lovely girl of fifteen with every advantage of education. But we wlll enter his parlor with him and witness the domestic scene, the idea of which excited the envy of the watchman. The merchant threw aside his cloak and hat and listened a moment in the hall to the sound of the pleasant voices of his children which reached his ears. He sighed. `Let them be happy now! They know not at what expense of peace of mind I purchased for them this enjoyment.' Mr. Hart, though uncharitable and unfeeling when called upon to administer of his wealth to the necessities of others, was a kind and affectionate father. Those who knew him only in his family regarded him as a most excellent husband and parent, and a kind, pleasant man. He was so ndeed, wherever money was not concerned. When this was the subject present, he knew neither friendship nor affection. `Business' was the magic word which covered a thousand acts that were far removed from charity, or honesty. But so long as the world knew not the selfish and unlawful springs of action he cared not the result upon others. He was a merciless landlord and a hard creditor. But this was all in the way of `business!' So he had gotten rich, and men respected him because he had gotten rich. His wife moved in the `set' that became his pretensions and they belonged to the fashionable and gay world, they and their children. But all is not prosperity that seems so. Four years previous to the present time of our story Mr. Hart had been placed in a very critical situation for his credit, through the failure of a House for which he had endorsed heavier than he should have done. The announcement of their failure and the notification that their several notes to the aggregate sum of sixteen thousand dollars had become due with three days grace were simultaneous. He had not a quarter of the sum at command and had only the day before invested in a railroad all the money he had of his own besides much he had borrowed of the banks. His credit as a merchant was in danger; and a merchant's credit is his life. He thought of no way of raising the money but by mortgaging one of his houses, and this he feared to do lest it should subject his soundness to suspicion. At length he thought of a merchant who had retired from business of whom he might possibly borrow twelve thousand dollars for a few days. He applied to him, but this gentleman, though very opulent was not able to oblige him, and declined loaning his note on the plea that he already had it on so much paper in Bank. `Then if he has it on so much, it will be of little consequence whether it is on another note or not,' said Mr. Hart to himself, as he left his dwelling full of the most agonising anticipations of the blow about to fall upon his good name. Suddenly a temptation rose up in his mind! It was a temptation to make use of the rich man's name by forgery. Mr. Hart did not at once reject the thought, but as he walked along dwelt upon it; and each moment the idea of obtaining relief in this way grew stronger. `It will not be a forgery,' he said to himself, `for I have the intention to take it up' He said he hardly knew whose notes his name was on, he had endorsed so many! Then I have no fear of detection! Before its maturity or he received a Bank notice, I should pay and destroy it! I see no other alternative! It must not be that the house of Henry Hart fails for inability to meet a sudden payment of sixteen thousand dollars! In a few days I can command twice this sum, and shall I now be ruined for want of half of it.' Mr. Hart was alone in his counting room. Before him on the desk lay a note in his handwriting. It read as follows— Boston, April 20, 1839. $12,000. `Thirty days from date for value received I promise to pay Henry Hart, or order, twelve thousand dollars.' He stood for some time with his pen in his hand looking at what he had written. His face was pale; his lips firmly compressed. Three several times he had dipped his pen into the leaden standish by his arm and each time hesitated to copy the signature from an old letter which he had imitated closely on a sheet of paper he had just torn up and thrown into the grate. `It is but a dash of the pen! and there is really no crime—and certainly no danger! Yet I do not like to do it. But there is no other means of safety! I would die rather than be protested in bank! I know I can take it up and Mr. Stebbins will never be the wiser for the use that has been made of his name! It must be done!' He drew the note before him and then with a slow but firm hand copied accurately the signature, `Robert Stebbins,' at the bottom of the note! `It is done,' he cried, dashing the pen upon the floor and crushing it with his foot. He cast sand upon the forged name, endorsed his own upon the back of the note, and then tak ing his hat went out. At a merchant's in — street he stopped and readily obtained a signature. `Been selling property to old Stebbins, Mr. Hart?' asked the merchant. `Yes'—he answered coloring, and thus sealing his forgery with a falsehood. The note was discounted without question, as Mr. Hart well knew it would be. Some days before it matured he took it up; and when it was placed in his hands he felt a degree of relief that he had been a stranger to for many days. Crime, when the breast of the criminal alone holds the secret, makes the heart of man ill at ease. The danger was now over and Mr. Hart that night slept soundly. But the consequences of the act he had been guilty of remained in its effects upon his own moral feeling. This had become less sensitive; and there was now no assurance that in a parallel emergency he who had once resorted to unlawful means to extricate himself would not do so again and again. Up to this time, however, when we meet him in his front-hall listening to the merry voices of his children he had not a second time yielded to the temptation; for tempted since he had often times been in the vicissitudes of his extensive and complicated business to relieve himself in this way. His affairs were now outwardly prospering, but his circumstances were far from being prosperous. He had met with heavy losses and had been very much embarrassed by unsuccessful speculations. Nearly all his real estate had been privately sacrificed to make good the amounts he had drawn from his business capital to meet their losses; for he had sold property instead of resorting to false notes. The recollection of the state of mental suffering he had undergone while the forged note lay in the Bank out of his hands, was fresh and vivid, and led him to make any sacrifice rather than subject himself again to these distressing fears of detection. Such was the character and condition of Mr. Henry Hart, the wealthy merchant, whose supposed happiness awakened the envy of the watchman. But we will not keep him longer in the hall. He opened the door and the scene that met his eyes was one familiar to him but not so to the reader. The room was the front one of two large and lofty apartments connected by folding doors, which in summer were always open. They were now closed and an elegant piano stood against the polished doors; at which, as he entered, a beautiful young girl of fifteen was seated, not playing but laughing and talking with a handsome youth of nineteen or twenty, who was bending gracefully over her. In the centre of the parlor was a large round table supporting a bronzed astral lamp, which shed a rich, subdued, yet clear light throughout the apartment. Beneath it around the table were seven or eight boys and misses under twelve, playing at a game called `Dr. Busby,' with printed and beautifully colored cards; and as Mr. Hart entered they were shouting out with laughter all around for the `Black-Eyed Lover.' It was a merry and happy party of them, and every little heart was overrunning with happiness. Two of the children, a boy of eight and a little girl of six years, were the children of the rich merchant, the others were little visiters for the evening A few feet removed from the table sat in a velvet rocking chair a handsome and very lady-like person sewing white fur upon a child's pelisse. She was about thirty-eight, and yet was youthful in her appearance. Her form, however, was slight, and her health was evidently delicate At intervals she would suspend her work and look at the children around the table with smiling interest in their amusement. Often she would be referred to by some one of the little people as authority for such, and such modes of playing the game, when she would give her opinion with a grace and kindness than won their hearts. Mrs. Hart was only happy in her children! The rich crimson drapery of the windows, the costly mirrors, the gorgeous carpet, the expensive furniture and lavish ornaments of the room in which she sat made no portion of her enjoyment. She would have been as happy in the humblest abode with her children gathered around a pine table, in health, as she was now. Her happiness, as Echardt would have said, she drew from within, and was not dependent for it on outward circumstances. It often takes a whole life to learn this `wisdom of life,' and few attain it, else there would be fewer to complain of this world, as `A dull and fleeting show;' a pendulum `swinging between a smile and a tear.' On opening the door, the husband and father was greeted by half a dozen voices. `There is pa!' said the mother rising and meeting him with a smile. `We were all just wishing, dear, you would be in by eight o'clock! `Oh, pa, how glad I am your come!' cried a rosy little fellow of eight years, throwing up his arms with glee, `we want you to come and play Dr. Busby with us.' `Dear papa!' exclaimed Grace, the little maiden of six years, whose pelisse her ma was trimming with warm fur for the cold winter; and leaving her chair she ran to him to be kissed. He stooped and took her in his arms, and lifting her high from the floor, kissed her rosy mouth and then let her down again; her ringlets flying in the rapid descent above her head like a thousand ringlets of gold. With a light bound she recovered herself and flew back to her play, shouting, `Dr. Busby's son,' when all laughed merrily and loud, for Dr. Busby's son was not the right card to be called. The scene fell like moral sunshine upon the merchant's clouded heart; for he had come home with a dark, gloomy spirit, having been all day perplexed with new difficulties that had arisen in his affairs. His reception and the joyous hearts and the demonstrations of affection restored him to himself and caused him to forget his anxieties. `You are cold, dear father,' said Ellen, his eldest daughter, folding his hand in both her's! `There is your nice arm-chair been waiting for you all the evening. But I forgot to introduce you to Edward Elmore. He has just returned from college!' and Ellen blushed; why, she did not know! The young collegian shook Mr. Hart's hand in a frank, yet respectful manner, saying— `I suppose you must quite have forgotten me, sir?' `Are you not Dr. Elmore's son? `Yes, sir.' `I know you more, sir, by the likeness you bear your father than from any recollection I have of you as a boy before you went away.' `Edward has altered very much,' said Mrs. Hart, looking at his manly figure and fine open countenance with kindly admiration. `And sister Ellen says he has grown so handsome too!' hallooed from the circle round the table little Tommy, the rosy cheeked, curly-headed lad of eight years old. `I 'spec' she'll have him for a beau!' `Why Tommy are you not ashamed?' exclaimed Ellen, running to him and pulling his hair, as much to hide her blushes from Edward as to punish him for his mischievous betrayal of her opinion. `Ellen, dear, you will order your pa's tea in,' said her mother with a smile. The confused maiden ran out of the room glad to hide her embarrassment. Would she have been embarrassed, my fair reader, if telltale little Tommy instead of minding his game of `Dr. Busby' had not come near the truth? Would she have blushed if she had thought nothing about him? And would he have colored as he did and turned to the piano to admire very perseveringly the gilded ornaments encompassing the name of the maker, if he had not thought of the beauteous Ellen with more particularity than he regarded other young misses? We leave the question unanswered. The random words of the little Tommy, however, made an impression upon the minds of both parents and instinctively they looked at each other and divined each other's thoughts. Young Edward Elmore, though still very young, and just graduated at Yale College, was destined nevertheless to hold a position in society through the wealth and influence of his family, that rendered him even at this age a `good match' in prospective in the eyes of parents who were far-sighted; and such a parent was Mr. Hart. The idea took possession of his mind, and was one that he received with pleasure. Dr. Elmore, the father of Edward, had been a physician in London, of considerable eminence; but marrying a Bostonian, and having inherited a handsome fortune, he removed to the United States. He now resided in Boston, a retired gentleman, but with the reputation of being rich; Edward was his oldest son; but he had two daughters, both older than Edward. The knowledge that Dr. Elmore was related to a noble family in England gave him and his children a consideration in society extraneous from that conferred upon him by his wealth. The character of Edward was every thing a judicious and fond father could desire. He was manly, honorable and frank. Integrity and uprightness of heart and feeling strongly characterized him. His disposition was generous, and his intellect of a superior cast. His advantages had been closely improved, and he now was entering life with the brightest prospect before him of usefulness and honor. He had already commenced the study of medicine with his father; for, though rich, he wisely resolved to secure to himself a means of independence that had a basis more stable than money. In his boyhood he had known Ellen Hart, and one of his first visits, on his return, had been to her, whose lovely image had often flitted over his pages among Greek characters, and the cold outlines of mathematical demonstrations.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER II. The morning after the family scene described in the last Chapter, Henry Hart was in his private Counting Room. The door was closed and the key turned in the lock. He was walking the floor with a quick, restless step. His usually placid brow wore a cloud, and his lips were compressed with energy or nibbled by his teeth with vexation. At intervals he would pause before the window and look out, but with a vacant gaze, as no object but a lofty brick wall was visible; or he would cast his eyes upon his green cloth covered table, where lay a confused pile of papers folded and torn open, and several letters looking as if they had just been received, and with a muttered word or two expressive of mental suffering to which the sight give rise, clench his hands forcibly and turn away, and continue his walk with greater vehemence than before. At length he stopped full before the table, took the arm chair and drawing it towards him sat down. His face was pale; his eyes cold and hard, and upon his high, bald forehead stood a large drop of sweat which some internal anguish had forced through the pores of the skin. He laid his forehead in his hand and a deep sigh escaped him. At his elbow lay an open letter on which his gaze rested with that hopeless look of despair with which the victim of the guillotine may be supposed to contemplate the axe. `There is no alternative—no other resource,' he said in a hollow voice, unconsciously speaking audibly; `I must before three o'clock this afternoon obtain the money or I am ruined—my credit is gone and my family beggared! Never did a merchant open so fatal a morning's mail as this that lies upon my table. Losses and ill-adventure have come upon me from every wind of heaven! And the intelligence in this letter from Vera Cruz has put the climax upon my misfortunes. The ship in which I had invested half of my means, taken by a party of Mexican Revolutionists in the very port, rifled of her cargo and lawlessly converted into a war-vessel; and the policy of Insurance has expired some days, and is unrenewed. To this comes two notes due to-day, one of four and the other of seven thousand dollars, which must be paid. To this comes the failure of my speculation in Indian lands and the utter worthlessness of the bonds I hold. Of full seventy-two thousand dollars invested in various ways, I find I possess not a single dollar. Yet here is my mercantile firm, who must be maintained. I have in it, and in property unmortgaged in the city, say thirty thousand dollars. But my liabilities are every dollar of my lost investments, if not more. I cannot owe in notes less than seventy-five thousand dollars. I am therefore forty thousand dollars worse than nothing. I am bankrupt if the world did but know it. But the world does not know and shall not know,' he said emphatically. `No one knows that I am not insured in my Mexican affair but myself and Creech. That man must be taken into my confidence. I must not sink without a struggle. These evils have come upon me, I have not brought them upon myself. I will see Creech, and consult with him!' He rose, and going to the door unlocked it, and called in an even tone of voice, `Mr. Creech!' He then returned and resumed his place at the table. The call was responded by a slender, thin faced man, about forty years of age. His head was very narrow and very high above the ears, and the whity yellow hair that adorned it was cut very short and precise— Mr. Creech's eye-brows were yellow and very bushy and he prided himself upon three or four of the hairs composing each for their length, being in length full an inch and a half. These formidable eye-brows shaded a pair of small lively, weasel-looking eyes, in which always shone a little sparkling light expressive of vivacity and cunning. The color of Mr. Creech's visual organs was a hue between a light blue and dark grey; a color often found in some men, but difficult to describe. Men who have eyes like those of Mr. Creech are shrewd and dangerons to be trusted. Mr. Creech's nose was short, quite too short for his face, which was very long, unreasonably long. His mouth had no outward sign of lips. It was a narrow slit in the vast space between his snip nose and the end of his long, pointed chin. It opened and shut like an oyster with as fine an edge. The first Clerk, for such was the position held by Mr. Creech in the Commercial House of Mr. Hart was also a cultivator of whiskers, some of which, or which we will cut of courtesy, and for want of another word, call such, graced the sides of his white face. They were about the size of his eye-brows, and of the same tarnished yellow hue. The first clerk had also very large ears, with which, nature, anticipating his profession, had kindly furnished him doubtless for the use he made of them—viz, a sort of `becket' for pens; four or five of which he always had sticking above each generous member. We will finish the portrait of Mr. Creech by adding a neck, short and thick, in a white and pink cravat, a white and pink plaid waistcoat, a brown tonnish coat with velvet collar, and velvet cuffs, with the corner of a white pocket handkerchief sticking out of the pocket; a Gen. Jackson's head in a breast-pin; a pair of black pants, and boots with heels of unusual height, and an enormous seal ring graved with the `Creech Arms' on his little finger. Mr. Creech never cleaned his teeth nor kept his nails free from certain black lines that sometimes adorn the extremities of those useful appendages. `Mr. Creech,' said Henry Hart without raising his eyes. `Mr. Hart,' answered the first Clerk, with a first Clerk's smile. `You may turn the key in the door if you please.' Mr. Creech very obligingly complied with the request, performing the act with as little noise as he could make, and then he returned on tip-too towards the table. `Sit down if you please,' said Mr. Hart. The first clerk bowed and sat down, fixing his little ferret eyes upon Mr. Hart as if to pick out beforehand a little of the matter about to be touched upon. `Mr. Creech I have called for you to confide in you,' said Mr. Hart, speaking after several counter resolutions in his mind not to entrust his secret to any one. But his knowledge of Creech's foresight, tact, and cunning in business, strengthened his first purpose. He also knew, or rather suspected, Mr. Creech not to be very precise in his no tions of morals; `in a business way,' always `I shall feel myself honored by your confidence, Muster Hurt,' answered the first Clerk who had a habit of giving to a the sound of u. `I huv often hud yur cunfidence, sir, und I flutter myself I huv never betray'd it.' `I have always been satisfied, Mr. Creech, said Henry Hart blandly. `But the matter I am now about to confide in you is not an ordinary business operation.' Seeing that his employer was silent, and seemed to be waiting for him to say something, the first Clerk bowed and said, `In whutever uffuir it may please you to entrust to me, whether dumestic ur mercuntile, I hup you will find me equully wurthy of your cunfidence. `The matter is one of the deepest importance to the interest of the House, Mr. Creech. It concerns its commercial stability.' The first Clerk started and looked at his employer as if uncertain whether he had rightly understood him. `Uffecting the credit of the House! Impussible, Mr. Hurt.' `Creech,' said Mr. Hart, `I think I understand your disposition and feelings with reference to me. You have been long in my employ, and your interests have, in a manner been identified with my own.' `Yes, sir, I huv always lukt ufter your interests, Mr. Hurt,' answered the first Clerk with a satisfied manner. `I think I can assure myself of your co-operation now.' `Certainly, sir.' `Read that letter, Mr. Creech,' said the merehant, placing in his hands the letter informing him of the loss of his vessel and cargo. He eyed him closely as he read it to see the effect produced upon him. `This is truly unfortunate—us the voyage wud huv been immensely prufitable, if it had been successful, Mr. Hurt. But the insurance will cover.' `The Policy is run out.' `And not renewed by you, sir!' `No. I meant to have done it to-day.' `It is not now too late! The uffices dunt know uf the luss,' said Mr. Creech eagerly. while his little sparkling eyes, betrayed the artfulness of his character. He spake quick and without reflection, for unprincipled men sometimes do. He was brought to reflection by the expression of Mr. Hart's face. `Would you have me do an act like that you suggest, sir?' demanded Mr. Hart sternly. `Pardon me, sir; I was unly regarding your interests, Mr. Hurt,' `I see I can trust you, Mr. Creech,' said the merchant changing his tone. `Listen to me! I am ruined. This letter is but one of several that came to me this morning, all containing bad news. I have not enough property at this moment to pay all my obligations, by the sum of forty thousand dollars! You look astonished. You are aware that my name is on paper to a very heavy amount.' `And eleven thousand dollars comes due to-day.' `I am aware of it,' answered the merchant, gloomily pointing to the bank notices that lay before him. `The ship and cargo is a dead loss at present. I may obtain something by way of indemnification from the Mexican Government by appealing to my own. But the process would require time. The emergency is pressing. The proposition you have made, I frankly confess occurred to me. I am confident the offices have not the news. But they will get it, suspect perhaps, and then I may be detected in taking out a Policy after the loss. `But whut cun be done, sir?' asked the first Clerk with a very heavy countenance; for he was thinking of his six month's salary yet due him and of being out of place. `Your interests are allied with mine—it is for your benefit to remain with me. My ruin will affect you.' `I will do ull I cun, Mr. Hurt, to udvise you.' `My plan is this, viz; To carry on business as if nothing had occurred and all was prosperous, as it seems to be. To do this, I must take up these notes due to-day. It is true I have now no means as a basis, but I have the credit of my mercantile name, and on this I will obtain the money. I will continue to do so until I can see what is likely to be the result. You must go out and get this money for me.' `But they will soon hear of the luss of your vessel, Mr. Hurt,' said Creech sagaciously. `True; but no one is aware she was not insured. The ætna office does not know at this moment but that I have got a Policy out at some other.' `True,' answered Mr. Creech, smiling at his employer's deep shrewdness. `We cun burrow un your name, Mr. Hurt, us much money us we shull wont fur the liubilities of the next sixty days.' `Yes. This method is my only present resource. I rely on your aid, Creech. What the result will be ultimately I cannot foresee. It will at least give me time to reflect on future proceedings. My name must be sustained. Let these two notes due now be protested, and to-morrow I could not borrow five dollars to save my family from the Alms House.' `It would be the blow to your ruin, sir.' `I well know it. They must first be looked after and paid, and then I can have time to deleberate before another note day comes round.' `Forbes &amp; Co's draft accepted by you for eight thousand dollars, based on the two hundred and ten bales of cotton you bought of them is the next.' `When does it become due?' `On the 16th—19th.' `And this is the ninth.' `Yes, sir.' `I cannot be ruined, Creech.' `It will never do, sir.' `I wish you to take my note for twelve thousand dollars, which I will fill out and sign in a moment to Grace, Frealy &amp; Co., and get their endorsement; also that of B. Pearce &amp; Co. I will make the note at sixty days. I would go myself, but I fear that they might discover from my countenance, which I cannot very well command, that all is not right. You will do better.' While Mr. Hart was speaking a singular expression came over the warped features of the first Clerk. It was a compound of cunning, power, ambition, and self-gratification. He looked thoughtful, and assumed a very humble air. `You are silent, Mr. Creech.' `I wus thinking, sir.' `Well, I hope you will think what is for your own and my advantage. If I fall you fall with me.' `I know it, sir.' `Something seems to be on your mind `You just said I must think to my own advantuge,' ventured the first Clerk. `Well.' `I was duing so,' answered Creech a little more confidentially. `Out with it,' cried Mr. Hart impatiently, who saw he had some covert purpose. `You say you are ruined, sir,' said Creech boldly, `and these letters prove it. You wish to sustain your credit awhile lunger un a faith placed in you by uthers. You desire my ussistunce and huv mude me your cunfidunt. You are pleased to say you depend un my couperution for success.' `And do you intend to betray this confidence and trust?' demanded Mr. Hart. `No, sir.' `Then why this enumeration?' `To impress upon your mind your true position and that which you occupy.' `You are impertinent, sir.' `Pardun me, Mr. Hurt I meant-no uffence. Perhaps I am not so clear as I wish to be. In a word if you wish to engage me as a party in a fraudulent trunsuction, you will best secure your interests and my full co-uperation by making me a partner.' `A partner in my House—my mercantile House do you mean?' repeated the merchant with surprise and indignation. `Such wus my meaning, Mr. Hurt,' answered Creech cooly. The merchant remained thoughtful a few moments, rose from his chair and once or twice walked the room. `It is well. I will do it. I have no House unless I can sustain myself. The papers shall at once be drawn up. But on one condition.' `Name it.' `That you negotiate all money matters.' `I consent.' `We understand each other, then, Creech,' `Yes, sir,' answered the new partner with imperturable coolness. `We are to be partners in a business based on a fraud, and to sustain each other in sustaining our House.' `Yes,' answered the merchant with a feeling of contempt and shame, not unmingled with an undefined apprehension of future evil. But he who prefers crime to poverty must reap the fruit of the harvest he sows. The notes in bank were paid by means of he endorsement of the two firms above named. The next morning appeared in the papers the following advertisement: `Henry Hart having this day taken into copartnership of business, Crockett Creech, the Firm will henceforth bear the designation of `Hart and Creech.' HENRY HART. CROCKET CREECH.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">CAAPTER III. Henry Hart was only relieved from one source of anxiety to be plunged into another. In forming the co-partnership with his unprincipled Clerk, Crocket Creech, he had sought a temporary purpose. This purpose he had effected. His notes were all met, and his credit remained unsuspected. The secret of the means by which it had been sustained was known only to himself and his partner.— But it was necessary not only to have money to lift their notes as they came due, but also for pursuing their business, and for their mutual maintainance. The expense of Mr. Hart's family, in his style of living was five thousand dollars per annum; and Mr. Creech, though a bachelor, as an equal partner, considered himself entitled to an equal sum.— One morning the two met in their counting room. It was just a month after their criminal copartnercy was formed; in consenting to which, Mr. Hart felt that he had sold himself to his unprincipled partner. Creech was writing at the desk when Mr. Hart came in, and silently sat down by the table to glance over the morning papers. Creech paused in in his writing, and after surveying the face of his senior partner in the firm with penetrating eyes, he laid aside the pen and approached the table. Mr. Hart raised his eyes. They were heavy and thoughtful. His brow looked care worn. The frank and dignified bearing, the open demeanor of the honest and upright merchant were gone. He felt himself criminal, and looked one. `Well, Mr. Creech,' he said gloomily; `any thing unpleasant to communicate?' `No, sir, I have a little business on my mind, we had best talk over.' `Well,' answered Mr. Hart in a sort of despairing tone of voice. `The old notes are all paid in the Bank by the new endorsements,' said Mr. Creech cheerfully, and with a very well satisfied air. `Our firm, under its present name, takes well. Found no difficulty in getting the names I asked. Everybody glad to oblige!' And Mr. Creech looked precisely as if this universal disposition to oblige was all owing to the connection of his name with the house. `It was surely a great relief to get those notes and drafts paid,' said Henry Hart, looking as if the means to which he had resorted in conjunction with Creech, to meet them, had left a heavier load on his mind than was there before. `It was. None of the new notes come due under thirty-five days. Plenty of breathing time, you see, Mr. Hart.' The merchant sighed. `You have too tender a conscience about these matters, Mr. Hart,' said Creech, who seemed to take to villainy with the greatest facility in the world. `All we have done has been in a business way. All fair and above board till found out!' `That is what troubles me! It will be very difficult to conceal our operations long,' answered Mr. Hart, looking into his partner's face, as if for that strength and confidence he felt himself so deficient in. It is true he had consented to a course of criminal duplicity to sustain his credit, but now that his credit had been sustained he felt that the sense of wrong was heavier upon him than the satisfaction which he expected would have followed. He would have rather now endure all the fears of mercantile ruin he before experienced than bear the pains of conscience and sense of self-degradation which now pressed him to the earth. He felt degraded, too, at his association with another, who now acted out his true character without fear; a character perfect in cunning and duplicity; and wholly superior to the twinges of conscience, or the reflections of remorse. To be linked, inseparably, with such a person whom he felt would stop at nothing, now that power was placed in his hands, caused him each day increasing alarm and unavailing regrets. He felt his character was wholly in his partner's hands; and that if he chose he would make him the instrument of any depraved villainy his fertile brain might conceive. Creech, on the other hand, felt all the advantages of his connection with Mr. Hart.— His acute, plotting mind foresaw all the benefits that might accrue to himself from the partnership, though on forming it l.e was well aware Mr. Hart was not only not worth a dollar in the world, but several thousands worse than nothing. But Creech was honest only where it was his interest to be so. He was ready to be dishonest if he could thereby make it more for his advantage than to remain honest. The situation of Mr. Hart's affairs, with the guilty proposition this gentleman made to him to enable the house to sustain its falling credit, presented to his mind a fair opening for an advantageous investment of his genius. He saw at a glance all the privileges and all the risks. His eye coolly surveyed the dangers that encompassed the path before him, and his sagacity devised a way of escaping their responsibility. It has been seen with what art he effected his purpose in becoming a partner in the House. From this time seeming to act with Mr. Hart, he acted only for himself. He made Mr. Hart his instrument, even before that gentleman had a fear awakened that he might do so. The endorsements to the notes to take up the matured paper, were obtained personally by Mr. Creech, from merchants with whom he had mutually endorsed, but he in every instance bore from Mr. Hart a line, which he persuaded him to write, addressed to the Houses whose endorsements were to be solicited to this effect: `Gentlemen, Your endorsement upon the enclosed note for — at — days will oblige, Very truly yours, HENRY HART. Now of Firm of HART &amp; CREECH. Thus Mr. Creech felt that if discovery took place the responsibility could be easily removed from his own shoulders to those of the senior partner. Yet he felt he was not altogether secure, and could not be too cautious. `There can be no fear of detection, if we are true to our own interests,' he said in reply to the remarks of Mr. Hart. Mr. Creech spoke significantly. The merchant looked at him with a troubled countenance. `You do not understand me, Mr. Hart,' said the junior partner, taking a pen from behind his ear, opening his penknife and cooly nibbing it upon his thumb nail. `No. If it is any more endorsing on nothing I have done with it.' `Pooh, pooh, sir, we have just began.' `Just begun! Mr. Creech, I entered into this matter with you, only for a specific end.' `And is that end attained.' `Yes. The notes are met, and the ruin that menaced me postponed till I could have time for reflection. I have reflected; and the conclusion I have come to is, that the fruit is not worth the risk I have run.' `You surprise me! You then would prefer being a bankrupt, to your present fair credit.' `I am a bankrupt.' `Only to yourself and me! The world is ignorant of it.' `I would rather have been honestly ruined a month ago, by the loss of my vessels and the other misfortunes that I brought not upon myself, than be at this moment as I am, feeling as I do. Then I should only have lost my mercantile name, which would alone have touched me. But now, detection of the course I have resorted to will not only blast my reputation as a merchant, but ruin my character, and inflict upon my wife and children indelible infamy.' `What do you propose to do, sir?' asked Mr. Creech, surprised at the emotion and positive spirit shown by Mr. Hart, who after speaking, rose up and paced the counting-room with a highly agitated manner. `Do?' he repeated sternly. `Stop where we are.' `And how will you meet the note with Green &amp; Kennedy's endorsement due in thirty five days; and the other notes that all come due within sixty days?' `Not by getting other endorsements on false paper,' answered Mr. Hart firmly. `How then, sir?' asked the junior partner quietly. Mr. Hart was silent. He stopped in his agitated walk and looked thoughtful. `They must not be protested,' he said very positively, his sensitiveness as a merchant for the moment rising above every other feeling. `It would bring inquiry and detection.' `It may as well come first as last. I expect every moment when the news of my losses at sea will get into the papers; when, of course, I shall be asked where I insured. If I tell the truth my credit is impaired at once. It is my intention, as soon as it is made public, to use the news as a pretext for failing, and it will be an excuse for not taking up the notes due. Under color of it (as no one but ourselves know of our having had letters,) I can make an honest failure. I am tired of this suspense—this state of alarm—this continued fear of detection. `This is a very weak and idle course, Mr. Hurt. Besides, it is one I shall by no means consent to. It is not my intention, a month after entering into partnership to fail when I can sustain myself.' `You have no certainty that you can.' `I have. We only need to act together—to be bold and confident, and success and fortune are ours.' Mr. Hart stared with surprise at the resolute words and manner of his partner. After a moment he slowly shook his head. `Impossible. I dare not risk it. I have a wife—children who look up to me—' `True,' interrupted Creech, not giving him time to complete his sentence; `it is for this very reason you should now go on as we have begun. You say you are willing to fail.— Will not this beggar those who look up to you for support? Every thing will be taken, even to your household furniture. You will be turned into the street. You will have to rent some wretched hovel. You will be accountable for all the evils your family may suffer in their poverty and destruction.' `You paint a dreadful picture,' said Mr. Hart, shuddering. `I feel all its truth, But what I meant was, that in your disgrace, if detection follows, no one is involved but yourself. In mine, my family are mingled.' `So much the more need to be firm now, that you may bring upon them neither poverty on one hand, nor disgrace on the other. I I think I understand your feelings, Mr. Hart. But your true position is this; on one hand you are ready to surrender yourself as a bankrupt, and become a beggar with your family! On the other hand you have before you certain support for them in their present position in society, with only a risk that your mode of doing business may possibly be discovered, and bring upon you and them disgrace. On one side is positive beggary; on the other scarcely possible detection and dishonor. In a word, Mr. Hart, you have gone too far to recede.' `I fear I have,' he said bitterly. But if I consent longer to pursue this criminal course, what certainty is there that it will profit us beyond putting off the evil day, Mr. Creech? You know well we have no money. How are we to realize ten thousand a year to be shared between us, and pay the salaries of our clerks? God knows how we are to realize the first hundred! We have in store about eight thousand dollars worth of merchandize on commission, which is already bargained for. Our commissions will be a mere nothing. We have false notes due altogether in six weeks, to the amount of thirty-four thousand dollars, of which we cannot pay a dollar. I owe for the rent of the store eight hundred dollars, and clerk's salaries now due, amount to twenty-one hundred more. I owe heavy grocer's accounts, and apothecary bills, and a hundred other family debts. If you can tell me a better course than to fail at once, let me hear it.' `Fail you shall not, with my consent, sir,' answered the junior partner in a resolute and, as Mr. Hart thought, a menacing tone. `I have too much at stake lightly to suffer such a step to be taken.' `Do you dictate, sir? `No, sir. Let us understand one another perfectly, Mr. Hart. In making me the confidant of your affairs, you laid open to me the duplicity of your character, because you needed me. In becoming your confidaut I exposed to you my own principles, which you see are rather liberal. In a word, we communicated (for purposes founded on mutual interest) each to the other our true characters.— We therefore mutually had a hold upon each other. As partners in deception we are on equal footiug. We are neither authorised to dictate, and neither compelled, either, to succumb. In this matter I am your equal. Now tant I have let you see my character, I am not going to part with the secret for nothing. I must realise something by it.' `In supposing me your equal in villainy, sir,' said Mr. Hart with severe dignity, `you labor under a great error. Your character, I see is rotten thoroughly. My duplicity, of which you speak, was caused by a sudden reverse, and was only adopted to effect a temporary object. I am now willing to atone for my error by embracing the condition, which, by a criminal course, I have attempted to flee.' `We are embarked together. Take one step towards this purpose, and I betray you from the beginning, Mr. Hart. You are in error if you think you can now go back with honesty. All your late notes can be proved to have been drawn since you were informed of your losses. There are, besides, proofs that—' `Enough. I am in your toils, villain. Now let me hear your plans!' `You can call me names, Mr. Hart. I could retort and apply them to you with equal force. The consciousness of this is all the satisfaction I ask. The course of conduct I propose adopting you ask me to explain to you. I will do so.' As the junior partner spoke he advanced to the desk where he had been writing when Mr. Hart came in; and taking a key from his pocket opened with it a small drawer and took out several slips of paper. He then returned, and taking a chair familiarly near the merchant, laid them on the table.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">`Gentlemen, Your endorsement upon the enclosed note for — at — days will oblige, Very truly yours, HENRY HART. Now of Firm of HART &amp; CREECH.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER IV. After the Junior Partner had placed the papers which he had taken from the drawer, before Mr. Hart, he fixed a steady look upon his face for an instant and then said, in an under tone, `By reading these you will see the outline of my plan of operations, Mr. Hart.' `What is this?' exclaimed the merchant taking up one of the slips and intently regarding it. `A note for ten thousand dollars signed by Dr. Elmore and made payable to me! I have not had any transactions with Dr. Elmore, at least money transactions for several years.' `Very probable,' answered Creech dryly; `nevertheless here is his note for ten thousand dollars.' `How did you come by it?' demanded Mr. Hart with surprise, after carefully examining it, and satisfying himself that it was all in form. `I will explain that in a moment. Be so kind as to glance at the three other pieces of paper, sir.' `Another note drawn by Dr. Elmore in favor of our Firm for ten thousand dollars! One for eight thousand drawn by Robert Stebbins, and one for five thousand by Mr. Appleton, late of the House of Appleton &amp; Co? What means all this, Mr. Creech?' cried Mr. Hart, a momentary suspicion arising to his mind. `That these notes only require our endorsement and that of another House to be discounted. You see one is for 60 days—one for 90, and the other two at four months. Ample time for all our purposes.' `Mr. Creech,' exclaimed the merchant rising to his feet and speaking with indignant emotion, `those four notes are forged. The names are forgeries, sir! How dare you lay such paper before me, and have the audacity to demand my endorsement of the Firm.' `They are forgeries, Mr. Hart,' replied the Junior Partner calmly. `And you contess it. Sir, with these evidences of your guilt in my possession,' he cried, grasping the notes firmly and closely within his hand, `I no longer fear you. You are in my power, not I in yours! This moment consent to my wishes that all be at once stopped where it is, or I will with these in my hands, have you arrested.' The Junior Partner remained perfectly composed in look and manner, during the utterance of his threat. Mr. Hart was surprised, and seeing a smile at the corner of his mouth, a misgiving came over him. `You do not speak, sir.' `I have nothing to say, Mr. Hart. If you object to this step I am very sorry to have displeased you by suggesting it. But as you had once before made use of Mr. Stebbin's name, in a similar manner, I was not prepared for so decided a refusal.' The merchant turned pale. He hung his head in silent shame, not unmixed with alarm. An act committed three years before, and which he supposed unknown to every human being, was not a secret to his Junior Partner. He felt that he was indeed in his power. But his vexation and alarm were not greater than his astonishment at Creech's knowledge of the fact to which he had alluded. He saw now that there was no further use in struggling against the current, to which in an evil hour he had committed himself, and that he had opened before him for the future, a way of guilt and crime he shuddered to contemplate. He sat a few moments wholly overcome, and with a countenance wearing the pallor of the sepulchre. Large drops of sweat stood upon his forehead and his nether lip was tremulous with emotion. Creech stood observing him with a look of malicious triumph. At length the merchant spoke but without looking up, `I see, Mr. Creech, we have nothing to reproach one another with. I was not aware you knew this first wrong act of my mercantile life. May I ask you how a circumstance became known to you, which I believed was a secret locked in my own breast?' `I learned it from Mr. Stebbens himself.' `From himself! Impossible! Could he have known my use of his name, and suffered it to pass.' `No. I was well aware of your embarrassment at the time, being your first Clerk; indeed you made no secret of it to me, and wondered where you could possibly obtain the $12,000 you required, without impairing your credit. The next day you handed me Mr. Stebbins' note to take to the Bank for discount. It was discounted and you received the money, but I had at the time no suspicion that it was a forgery.' `And how did you discover it?' asked Mr. Hart, throwing off some of his habitual reserve. `In this way. A few days before it became due I was in the bank. Mr. Stebbins himself stood talking with another gentleman near the Cashier. He was speaking of endorsing in a manner that led me to suppose he had just declined letting the gentleman have his name. `I have not,' he said, `put my name to paper in any shape for the last three months, and shall not give it again to go into the bank. It is on some paper of old date and I shall not renew it at maturity. I have recently refused Henry Hart and others.' `Your note bearing Mr. Stebbins' signature I recollected had been dated within forty days, and his remark that he had refused you led me to suspect that you had forged his name!' Mr. Hart started and colored at the blunt mode in which Mr. Creech spoke the words. But he remained silent. `This suspicion led me to examine the note while in the hands of the bank, and I was strengthened in my suspicion. But a singular circumstance removed it beyond all doubt.' `And what was this?' eagerly questioned Mr. Hart, in a tone of the deepest surprise. `The next day I was looking over your blotting book for a slip of paper to write a porter's order upon, when on one of the leaves of the blotting paper I saw writing very boldly impressed. It was inverted and reversed, and I took out my pocket mirror to reflect it so that I could read it; a thing that is often done successfully. There has been many a secret betrayed by blotting paper. To my surprise I saw it was the form of Mr. Stebbins' note, and his signature beneath it, all as clearly legible as the original writing. It showed me at once that the note and signature were written at the same time and dried together. I knew Mr. Sebbins had not been in the Countring-room; besides you had told me when you brought me the note that he had signed it at his house! Here is the blotting paper,' added Creech, going and taking it from his private drawer and exhibiting it to him, though careful not to let him have in his possession so powerful an instrument over his fears. `I find I have nothing to conceal from you, Mr. Creech. But, if you have so long possessed this secret why did you not before avail yourself of it for your own interests!' `I was waiting my time.' `And you have entrusted it to no one!' `No, sir. Are you now ready, Mr. Hart, to act with me and fully sustain me in my plans.' `It is a risk; but I am in your power.' `We must go on for our mutual safety. Besides we must have ready money. These notes before you on their receiving your endorsement will at once be negotiated.' `Your endorsement for the Firm will answer equally well, Mr. Creech,' he said putting aside the pen filled with ink, proffered to him by his Junior Partner. `Your hand-writing would inspire more confidence in the bank than mine, Mr. Hart.' `Very well. Are you sure we are alone?' he said looking round with suspicion and alarm. `Quite so,' answered Creech, going to the door and trying the lock, and then returning to the table. `How shall we provide for these notes, Mr. Creech?' asked the fallen merchant, `before they are due. The bank must not have time to send notices to these persons whose names we borrow. `They will be provided for by other notes drawn up in the same manner. In this way we can carry on the business of the Firm and sustain the credit of the House. You can support your family in the style in which they now live; and I shall be able to live in a better style than I have done as a clerk—perhaps take a wife,' added the Junior Partner facetiously. `This is a dangerous business, but I see no remedy,' answered Mr. Hart, taking the pen Creech still held out. With a tremulous hand the merchant endorsed one after another the notes with the name of the Firm to which three were made payable, the fourth being drawn in favor of himself individually. He hesitated a moment before he wrote his name on this, and after doing so flung down the pen and covered his face with his hands. Mr. Creech took up the notes. For God's sake do not dry the names with blotting paper!' suddenly cried Mr. Hart. `I always use sand, sir. I never leave inverted copies of notes and letters for Clerk's to read with looking glasses.' The notes were duly presented to the bank and discounted, for better names than they bore were not desired by the Directors. The credit of the Firm of Hart and Creech was sustained by the money thus obtained; and Mr. Hart continued to live in his usual style; and Mr. Creech took board at the most fashionable hotel, and kept a horse and buggy and was altogether very magnificent. He enjoyed himself, for he had no conscience. But Mr. Hart carried about with him a heavy spirit and a clouded brow. On `Change men gave his great business the credit for it, supposing it required much and constant thought. His wife discovered the change in him, but to all her solicitous inquiries he returned vague and brief replies. This silence deeply afflicted her, and foreboding of evil depressed her. His children felt the change in his manner and tone of voice and shunned rather than flew to him. Thus those whom he had sacrificed every thing to make happy were in all their outward prosperity made wretched by him. Happiness was never yet the fruit of guilt. It bears sorrow ever, and forever sorrow will follow it. There are moral laws and necessities as well as physical; and the results of each are irresistably produced from causes equally apparent. On the other hand good will as certainly produce happiness and peace. Evil never came of a good act, was never the fruit of uprightness and integrity. He who seeks a good by an evil way is sure to be disappointed; not only in not attaining the good he pursues, but in obtaining an evil he did not expect. These reflections passed through the mind of Mr. Hart as he looked around him and saw the untoward fruits of his iniquity. But like a man whom error has made both weak and blind he went forward anticipating every hour when he should plunge into the gulf that he saw yawned to receive him. At length the time came he had looked forward to in sleepless nights and wretched days. The three notes had been taken up by Creech, by means of notes with the same names, negotiated a day or two before at other banks. There remained but one more due, and this was one of those forged on Dr. Elmore for $10,000. Mr. Creech with his usual foresight had made arrangements to provide for it, by drawing another note and forging the name, presenting it to Mr. Hart for his signature, who without a word always endorsed whatever was offered to him by the Junior Partner. This new note, however, met with quite an unlooked for fate. Creech had offered it the day before discount-day at the Bank so that the funds could be drawn in time to meet the other, which would be at maturity the next week. But it so chanced that on the morning of the day of discounting it was discovered that the Bank had been broken open, the books mutilated, a large amount of money taken, and the papers of the Bank thrown, as if by design, into the most inextricable confusion. The Directors, therefore, transacted no business, and the note lay over with others till the next discount day. But this would be too late to use the money and Creech withdrew the note, and set his wits to work what to do. He thought of going to a broker with the paper, but he feared that Dr. Elmore might possibly hear of his name being used on the street and that a discovery would then be inevitable. The day of taking up the matured note at length arrived and nothing had been done. Every resource had failed them. The Junior Partner could not resort to another expedient. Mr. Hart, who, inspired by the near danger, had greatly exerted himself, was almost in despair. A protest would surely lead to a detection of the forgery. `We must try a broker, sir,' said Creech, as the hand of the counting-house clock pointed silently to one o'clock. `There is but little time.' `We must run this risk,' answered the merchant with an accent and look of calm desperation. Mr. Creech took up his hat and left the counting-room. In a half an hour Creech re-entered with a smiling face. `It is done. Here are nine thousand and nine hundred dollars. You have a hundred in the safe.' `Who did it?' `W —.' `Did he question you?' `No. I told him of the cause, the robbery of the bank. He was satisfied.' `If it can be kept from Dr. Elmore.' `I think there is no fear. Indeed I told W — not to let it be known he had done it to the Dr., as he might not like to have a note given for discount in bank, negotiated by a broker.' `I will go to the bank with the money and take up the note myself,' answerd Mr. Hart. As he spoke he took possession of the bank notes and left the counting-room.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER V. Mr. Hart, traversed the streets in the direction of the bank with a light step and a feeling of great relief. He held in his hand the money to take up the last forged note then out, and in his inmost soul he resolved it should be the last he would put his name to, whatever exposure his Junior Partner might see fit to make in revenge. `I am tired of this constant, harrassing nervous apprehension of detection. Cleepless nights and feverish days! Carrying a weight about me in my bosom like lead! In ten minutes I shall have this last evidence of my forgeries in my possession, and then I am free. Creech will threaten, but I am persuaded he will do nothing. He knows his own ruin will be involved in mine. Let poverty come to me and mine. The experience I have had of the last few weeks has been enough to convince me that it is far more desirable than competence and luxury sustained by crime. So much for the first step in error taken four years ago to save my credit. It may be called a `fiction' in commercial phrase; but it is one in which is involved the most fearful realities. `Merchants have done it before,' says the wily Creech; `it is no new thing to use names of rich men in bank. They never know it if the notes are taken up.' But the risk is immense as I have bitterly seen, and the guilt is precisely that of the forger. A merchant that will make a fictitious note in the manner that I have done is to all purpose a forger! Such oh, God! is my crime! I hold in my hand the means of saving myself, but the guilt, because I can prevent its discovery, is no less. Ah, the bank is in my sight! In two minutes I shall have this weight off my mind. Dr. Elmore's forged name will once more be in my hands.' Mr. Hart was just then turning the corner of Kilby street. The bank was but a few rods distant on the opposite side of the way. In his hurry and anxiety and with his thoughts so busily engaged he did not observe that the walks in some places were covered with ice which required great caution in traversing them. He hastened across State street and stepped without heed upon the curbstone directly before the Bank door. It was as slippery as glass. His foot slipped, he endeavored to recover himself with the other when it also flew out from under him and he fell headlong into the very door way of the bank, striking his temples heavily against the stone step. He was immediately taking up insensible, and conveyed into the Apothecary's at the corner of Washington street, where the usual means were made use of to restore him. They were, however, only partially successful. He partly opened his eyes and his lips moved with scarcely audible sounds. The words were `notes'—`pocket book'—`Bank'—`two o'clock'—`pay.' No one understood the meaning of the incoherent phrases, which were scarcely intelligibly uttered. He was placed in a carriage; and, accompanied by Dr. Blake, his physician, who happened to be going into the Post Office as he was being taken into the apothecary's opposite, to his residence in — street. The motion of the carriage revived him a little. He opened his eyes and looked wildly around him. He recognised his physician and the reality of his situation seemed to come full upon his mind. He raised himself from the position in which he had laid reclining against the back of the coach, felt in his breast for his pocket book and vehemently grasped the Doctor's arm. `For God's sake stop the carriage, Doctor,' he cried with vehemence. `Be calm, my dear sir,' said the physician soothingly. `You have been hurt and will soon be at home where you can receive attention.' `Home!' he repeated almost with a shriek which led the Doctor to believe that his brain had been seriously injured and that he was deranged, `I have no home, if you do not stop the carriage this instant—no home but a prisoner's cell,' he muttered in a deep, painful tone, that confirmed his physician's opinion of his insanity. `Will you not stop the coach, sir? Then I will!' he cried furiously. He was on the back seat of the carriage, and as he spoke threw himself forward and dashed his clenched hand through the front glass. `Driver, stop the carriage this instant!, `Mr. Hart,' said the physician grasping his bleeding hand which he had cut with the glass, and speaking firmly `you must be seated and be composed. In a few moments we shall be at your house.' `Shall I stop the coach intirely for the madman, Docthur?' asked the coachman, who had reined in his horses and was now thursting his face back through the broken pane. `No—drive on as rapidly as you can go!' `If he does I will have your life, Doctor?' fiercely cried the merchant, attempting to seize the physician by the throat with his disengaged hand. `You must be calm, Mr. Hart?' `Calm! Tell me to be calm when infamy and ruin hang over my head! What is the hour?' he cried at the same time taking out his watch. `Perhaps my fate is already sealed!' He glanced at it. It was twenty minutes past the hour when his note should have been paid. He crushed the watch up in his phrezied grasp till the sharp pieces of glass penetrated the palm of his hand; when he violently dashed it upon the floor of the coach and ground it beneath his heel. He threw himself back in the carriage and covered his face with his hands. The calmness of his manner singularly contrasted with his violence the instant before. The Doctor made no remark but watched him closely as he would a maniac. Suddenly he threw out his hands. A ray of hope lighted up his features of despair. `It is not too late. I can pay it without any disgrace coming upon me, or discovery. My fall will be taken as an excuse. It is known I fell near the bank—didn't I Doctor? And here is the money in my pocket-book. They wont protest it! I will go now! They will let me pay it and it will pass as if nothing had happened. Doctor stop this carriage,' he said in a tone of command. `We are near your house now, Mr. Hart!' `Hear me, sir! I am not mad, but I shall be if you thwart me! I was going into the bank to pay a note due at 2 o'clock, when it seems I slipped and fell. I recollect falling. It is now past the hour, but it may not be too late, to save protest when it is explained that I was going into the bank to pay the note when I slipped. I have got the money here and I insist, sir, in going at once to the bank. My credit—my honor—all is at stake, sir! Do not countermand my order to the driver.' `Do not trouble yourself to speak to him, Mr. Hart. You shall be gratified. I can now in some degree account for your manner.' The Doctor gave the order to the driver to turn back and proceed towards — Bank in State Street. The carriage had arrived in sight of Mr. Hart's house when the carriage turned. We will precede them to the bank. After Mr. Hart had been taken up by some of his friends, the merchants near, and conveyed to the Apothecary and from thence had been sent homeward under the care of his physician, his fall was a few moments afterwards the subject of a conservation by a group of gentleman gathered in front of the bank.— Among them was a man about fifty, of a dignified, courtly presence, and the air of an highly accomplished person. He was dressed with great neatness, in an olive brown coat with broad skirts, and wore ruffles in his bosom; his grey head was covered by a broad brimmed white hat, and he carried in his hand a gold-headed cane well polished by use. On the head was engraved `Dr. Elmore.' `I fear Mr. Hart will not get over this very soon,' said the President of an Insurance company to the others. `It was a heavy fall,' was the reply of an East India merchant; who in the same breath turned and asked his friend how such a stock stood. `Falling,' was the reply. `If Hart should not get over this,' said a retired Kilby street importer, `his new partner, Creech would have jumped into a fine business.' `I suppose Mr. Hart would leave his family quite independent?' remarked the cashier of a bank to Dr. Elmore. `I presume so, sir, though I know but little about his affairs of late.' `There are rumors that he has met with some bad speculations,' said the first merchant who had spoken. `But he keeps his business affairs so close few know much about it.' `He seems to stand well in Bank. I see he easily gets discounted what paper he offers,' said a broker—the same Mr. W — who had negotiated the note that morning with Dr. Elmore's name forged to it, with the amount of which in his possession Mr. Hart had come to take up the other forged note, when he met with his accident. `I believe so—though there was a rumor yesterday his ship and cargo that was seized by the Mexican's was no where insured.' `Is it possible?' exclaimed the broker. `Mr. Felton of the — Insurance office told me yesterday that his board had taken it; but that the policy expired and that Mr. Hart had not renewed it with them. That he asked him a day or two ago when the loss of the vessel was made known through the papers, where he was insured and his reply was at Hartford and New London. But one of the directors from Hartford was here yesterday, and on being spoken to incidentally upon the subject told me that there was no such policy given from the office there, and that Mr. Hart must have been misunderstood.' `Doubtless he was, sir,' said Dr. Elmore. `I have long known Mr. Hart and believe him to be in every respect an honorable man.' This opinion was assented to by all present, and the individuals of the group moved different ways, forgetting Mr. Hart and his concerns. Dr. Elmore remained standing by the bank door alone, surveying the busy scene on 'Change, when he was rejoined by Mr. W — the broker who had just been into the bank to make a deposit. As he came out the clock struck two. `I was just in time, Dr. Elmore.' `Yes, sir.' `Doctor,' he said after a moment's hesitation and embarrassnent, `suppose you had offered a note to the — Bank which was broken open, for discount, and the discount business was suspended and your note came back upon your hands would you object to negotiating it with a broker? and for him to use it?' `With my name, on it, sir?' `Yes, sir.' `Certainly, sir. I, however, should not be likely to offer such a note. I do very little banking business and only for the purpose of carrying through old business. I do nothing new.' `But you occasionally give your note in payment when you purchase.' `No, sir. I always pay by checks.' `You give your endorsement to your friends sometimes, and suppose one of them should come into my hands would you object to my making use of it in market?' `I should object decidedly, sir. But I have given my endorsement to no new paper for a long time, sir.' `You mean —' `I mean, Mr. W—, what I say. I have not signed or endorsed my name for six months past on any paper.' `Can it be possible?' exclaimed Mr. W— looking at him with surprise and perplexing doubt. `Why are you so astonished, sir?' At this moment a gentleman came forth from the bank with a pen in his hand and without his hat, and touched Dr. Elmore on the shoulder. `Doctor, one moment if you please.' `Stay a moment, Doctor,' entreated Mr. W—. `But an instant, sir,' said the notary. Mr. W — not knowing what to make of what Dr. Elmore had said, followed him and the notary into the bank. `I find here a note of your's, Doctor Elmore,' said the notary, `endorsed by `Hart &amp; Creech' and `Gilman &amp; Foster;' it is due to day and unpaid. Not wishing to protest it, I spoke to you at the door supposing you were not aware that it was past the hour.' As he spoke the Notary diplayed the note before his eyes. Dr. Elmore took it in his hands and surveyed it with a look of incredulity. He read it, and his own name at the bottom, with the endorsements `twice over; and then quietly laid it upon the table, saying in a voice of singular composure, `Mr Notary, that note is a forgery.' `A forgery,' exclaimed Mr. W—, the broker, who had glanced over the note and seen that it was a counterpart to that he had that morning discounted; and said hurriedly, `Wait for me here an instant, Dr. Elmore,' he hurried to his office for the note he had negotiated. `And do you pronounce this name a forgery, Dr. Elmore?' asked the astonished Notary, placing his finger upon the forged signature. `I do, sir,' answered Dr. Elmore firmly. `Mr. W—now re-entered and placed his note before Dr. Elmore. `Sir—is that note genuine?' he demanded in a trembling voice and with a countenance pale as death. `No, sir,' answered Dr. Elmore, in a voice of mingled indignation and astonishment. `Do you say it is a forgery?' `I do, sir. They are both base forgeries. Till this moment I was not aware of the existence of either pieces of paper!' `Both drawn up payable to the order of `Hart &amp; Creech,' and endorsed by them and `Gilman &amp; Foster,' said the Notary. `There is mischief between them. Who do you suspect?' he added, looking at Dr. Elmore, who was walking up and down past the Cashier's counter with a thoughtful and troubled countenance. `I cannot tell, sir. Who offered the note here, sir?' `Mr. Creech,' answered the Cashier, whom he addressed. `And to you, sir?' `Mr. Creech.' `Thank God,' answered Dr. Elmore fervently. `I feared it was Henry Hart. My suspicions are removed. Mr. Hart, whatever be the event, is innocent of this crime, and knows nothing of it be assured gentleman.' At this moment a carriage drove rapidly up before the bank and stopped, and out of it leaped Mr. Hart with blood upon his forehead and a haggard and wild couutenance.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER VI. Mr. Hart having descended from the carriage with nervous haste, entered the bank followed by Dr. Blake. His eyes first fell on Mr. W—, the broker, who had the moment before returned from his office and was now holding the forged note at arm's length, looking at it the very picture of despair. From the broker they rested on Dr. Elmore, who stood talking with the cashier in a stern and excited manner. The merchant's soul shrunk within him. His heart failed him. His head swam round. His limbs refused their office; and with the agonizing assurance (for it was certainty rather than suspicion) that all was discovered, he staggered and caught by the counter for support. There he stood with a countenance like the hue of ashes and his gaze fixed in hopeless despair upon the face of Dr. Elmore who now turned to survey him. The emotion of Mr. Hart now fully confirmed the suspicions of the Cashier and the broker, who had very freely declared their belief in the guilt of Mr. Hart. But Dr. Elmore saw in his weakness only the effect of his recent accident. Although the circumstances were so strong against him Dr. Elmore could not believe him a party to the forgery. In his own mind he believed Mr. Hart to have been the victim of Creech's avarice and guilt; for what little intercourse Dr. Elmore had with this latter personage had by no means given him a high estimate of his moral principle and integrity. He therefore, now turned to Mr. Hart, whom he, as well as the other gentlemen, were astonished to see come in, with a kindness and sympathy in his tones that fell upon his bosom like the dew and the sunshine upon the withered earth, and said, `Is it possible, my dear sir, that you are so much recovered from your fall as to return to State Street. I am truly gratified to see you. You are still very pale; and I would advise you to return home as soon as your business will permit.' `I thank you, sir,' answered Henry Hart, a great load removed from his mind; for such was Dr. Elmore's manner, that in his heart he whispered to himself the flattering unction, `He does not suspect! I am safe! My fears are groundless.' `It is peculiarly fortunate Mr. Hart, that you have been able to return to the bank just at this crisis,' continued Dr. Elmore, `as a discovery has just been made which seriously interests you.' Henry Hart felt as if all the blood in his system was rushing to his head. He thought he should sink to the floor. With a superhuman effort he commanded himself, and attempted to look Dr. Elmore calmly in the face. But he could not lift his eyelids, weighed down with conscious guilt, from the floor. His whole frame trembled exceedingly and his physician placed a chair for him into which he sank; but all the time struggling with a great effort to appear calm and turn aside from himself suspicion. That Dr. Elmore's words had reference to the forgeries— that the broker's presence there at that crisis had connection with it, he was now convinced. A most miserable man was Henry Hart at that moment. If the floor had gaped beneath his chair and plunged him into some dark cavern where the light of human eyes could never penetrate his soul, where he should be insensible to the infamy that was to blast his name, it would have been a happy relief to him from the fearful exposure he dreaded. `What has occurred?' he faintly murmured. `A most unpleasant affair, I regret to say, Mr. Hart,' said Dr. Elmore with gentleness. `A strange, unaccountable occurrence, sir,' said the broker with warmth, at the same time approaching Mr. Hart's chair, and looking at him with the most intense suspicion mingled with impatience, the forged note held firmly in one hand and the fore finger of the other laid impressingly upon the name of the Firm endorsed upon it. `I fear Mr. Hart is at present too ill to listen to any exciting topic,' said his physician. `It is best he should know it, sir. His credit and good name are at stake,' answered Dr. Elmore. You must prepare yourself, Mr. Hart, to hear intelligence of no ordinary import. It is painful and will try all your nerves and self-possession. But in the first place let me assure you of my full conviction of your innocence and ignorance of the whole affair.' Henry Hart, who had groaned once heavily and covered his forehead with one hand, now looked up with more confidence; but the broker vented an ejaculation which seemed to express a decided and very positive difference of opinion from that given by Dr. Elmore. Mr. Hart caught the broker's eye and his own fell beneath it, while he said falteringly, `It is true, Dr. Elmore, I am very ill. I am not, I fear, quite myself. If you will go into the carriage with me I will there hear from you any thing you have to state affecting my honor and character.' `I would do that with pleasure if I could, sir; but it is necessary that the matter should be settled here. In a word, Mr. Hart, I find in Mr. Notary's hands here a note for ten thousand dollars—' `And one in mine for—, `interrupted the impatient broker. `Patience, Mr. W—,' said Dr. Elmore, checking the angry man, who, anticipating the loss of nearly ten thousand dollars, was in no very patient mood. `I find here, Mr. Hart, a note for ten thousand dollars drawn ostensibly by me and bearing my name for signature, made payable to your house, the endorsement of which it also bears; as well as that of another House, the head of which has been sent for and will be here shortly. This is the note,' continued Dr. Elmore holding before him the forged paper, `and the signature I have declared and now again pronounce it to be a forgery!' Dr. Elmore elevated his voice and spoke the last words with strong emphasis. Every eye was turned full upon Mr. Hart. He sat with his eyes upon the ground, one hand in his vest, as if pressing upon his heart to confine wild throbbing, the other supporting his forehead upon the arm of the chair. There was a moment's impressive silence. Even Mr. W—, restrained his impatience awaiting a reply. `Go on, sir,' hoarsely said Henry Hart without moving. `Have you nothing to say, sir?' asked Dr. Elmore with a countenance expressive of surprise. What could the guilty man say? His thoughts were in a tumult. But the instinct of self-preservation was lively and he resolved to save himself. `Yes, sir, I have something to say,' he replied, rising from his chair and assuming a face of indignant innocence. `It is that I feel surprised and grieved that you should suspect me of having forged a name to a note.' `I have not suspected you, Mr. Hart,' said Dr. Elmore warmly; `on the contrary I expressed my entire confidence in your innocence. You do me injustice, sir.' And Dr. Elmore for the first time began to feel suspicion. `You were only questioned as any other man would be, and would wish to be, under circumstances so peculiar.' `It is not surprising, gentlemen, that I should feel, in a case like this,' he answered with well feigned integrity. `The surprise at the discovery has deeply moved me. I pronounce the note a forgery.' `You confess it?' exclaimed Dr. Elmore. `I have no doubt it is a forgery,' said the broker in an ironical under tone. `Confess it—confess the note? No, sir? Do you mean to insult me, sir? I pronounce the endorsement of my firm a forgery.' `Who presented the note to the bank for discount, Mr. Cashier?' asked Dr. Elmore. `Mr. Creech, the Junior Partner.' `Creech! Then, gentlemen there is no mystery. I have long had my suspicions of my partner. I hope you will do me justice to believe me when I say that I have had till today no knowledge of the existence of this note.' `Nor of this, Mr. Hart?' demanded the notary who now began to believe in Mr. Hart's Innocence. `Mr. Hart glanced at this well known note; and, in spite of himself his face betrayed him guilty to the keenly observing eyes of the Cashier, who during the whole time had been watching its changing expressions. `No, sir,' he faintly answered. Too late to take up the first note he had resolved to deny all knowledge of the notes, and thus retain the ten thousand dollars he held in his pocket-book, for his own uses. He believed that he could successfully fasten the whole guilt upon Creech and himself escape from all suspicion. This idea gave him confidence and at the same time audacity. `Then you pronounce these endorsements forgeries, Mr. Hart?' asked Dr. Elmore, exhibiting the back of the note in his hand and with his finger pointing to that held by the broker. `I do unhesitatingly.' `And who do you believe to be the forger.' Mr. Hart hesitated. But feeling that all were intent upon his answer, he said, `Who negotiated this note with you Mr. W—?' `Mr. Creech,' answered the broker. `Unpleasant as it is for a merchant to suspect his partner in business of a crime like this, the fact that the notes were both offered by my Junior Partner, Mr. Creech, and are made payable to our Firm, I feel it my duty to charge him with being the drawer of both notes, and the forger of both signatures and of the endorsements.' `This is your belief, sir?' asked Dr. Elmore seriously. `It is,' answered Henry Hart, looking round with confidence till meeting the eye of the Cashier his own fell; and to his confusion he saw that there was at least one present who did not believe him innocent of the forgery. At this moment Mr. — of the Mercantile House, the endorsement of which was also on the notes with that of Hart &amp; Creech, entered the Bank. His surprise at the grave aspects of the persons present was by no means lessened when the Notary said, handing him the note, `Mr. — will you have the kindness to look at this endorsement. The note is already due as you will perceive.' The merchant looked at the endorsement and then read the note. Without hesitation he pronounced it a forgery. This the Cashier believed he would do; for in his own mind he had settled who was the guilty party; but still in the minds of the rest there was suspicion that this house might possibly be the drawers of the note. But the honest, indignant manner in which he pronounced the endorsement forged convinced all present that he was ignorant of the existence of such a note, and that a double forgery had been executed. The broker now showed his note, which he also declared a forgery. Suspicion was now fixed upon Mr. Creech; and Dr. Elmore and Mr — of the forged Firm and the broker at once decided to send for an officer, and arrest the Junior Partner at once. A messenger was at once despatched to the Police for officer Clapp. He had been absent but a few moments when, to the surprise of all Mr. Creech himself opened the inner green covered door, and appeared in person. The long absence of Mr. Hart from the Counting-House had made this precise, moral, very conscientious little gentleman exceedingly nervous. He felt every thing depended upon the safe payment of the bank note, to secure which he had so vigilently exerted himself and obtained the amount from Mr. W—, the broker. But half an hour had passed, and Mr. Hart not returning he became `fidgety,' to make use of a word which is quite expressive of the state of mind and body the junior partner was in. He kept repeatedly going to the door to look up the street, and as often returning to his desk. But to write was quite out of the question. He could only scribble over on a sheet of foolscap, `note,' `Dr. Elmore,'—`Bank,'—`$10,000,' and other words indicative of the current of his thoughts. At every two minutes he would take out his gold repeater and look at it. It seemed to him to have stopped, and he could only assure himself that it had not by holding it to his ear. He was about to send a clerk to the bank to see what had become of Mr. Hart, and in his mind cursing him for not at once returning and relieving his fears as to the fate of the note, when a merchant came in and informed him of Mr. Hart's accident. `Fiends! when did it happen? How long ago?' he demanded in consternation. `It must be nearly twenty minutes ago. I thought you must have heard of it, and am surprised you have not learned it. But he was at once taken to his house.' `Where did it occur?' `In the very door of — Bank!' `Good Heavens! Had he been in?' `He was crossing the street to the bank when he fell. He was immediately taken home in a hack.' `Excuse me, sir. I must at once go to him.' Mr. Creech seized his hat and flew towards the house of his partner. He wanted to learn from his own lips the fate of the note. He did not dare to go to the bank. His fears were in the ascendant. On reaching Mr. Hart's house and ringing the bell, the servant confounded him by saying Mr. Hart had not been at home since morning. `Has he not met with an accident?' `We have not heard of it.' `Was he not brought home in a carriage?' `No, sir.' `Strange, exclaimed Mr. Creech, staring the man in the face. The next moment he turned from the door leaving the servant to communicate his words to the family, and up on them inflict the first blow of the evils thawere soon to follow. Mr. Creech hastened back to his store. On his way he was more than once stopped by inquiries after Mr. Hart. `Could it be possible that he had been taken to the Hospital instead of his house?' he asked himself; for that he had met with an accident he was now convinced. On reaching the store and hearing nothing from him, and receiving no message, he resolved to relieve his apprehensions respecting the note, to proceed at once to the bank and learn it in person. He had a faint hope that it might have been taken up. At all events, its fate was by this time decided, and the sooner he knew what it was the better. He, therefore, assumed all the confidence he could command and took his way to the bank. He well knew it was shut for business, but that he could enter, and from the Notary's books ascertain how matters had gone, and what became of his senior partner. He expected to find no one in but this person. His surprise was apparent on coming suddenly upon the party of persons assembled there.— He stopped full, with his hand on the door, and rapidly glanced round upon them. The Cashier was leaning across the bank counter with a face grave and earnest; near him stood the notary, in whose hand the junior partner saw and recognised the forged note; standing by a chair, supporting himself by the back, stood Henry Hart, with a pale but hardened look; and in front of him was Mr. W—, the broker, who held in his hand the note he had but two hours before negotiated with him. A few paces off was Dr. Elmore, walking up and down the floor with a countenance full of seriousness. `It is all up,' was the remark Mr. Creech made to himself, on discovering this aspect of things. `I must get out of it the best way I can. I see how it stands now. They have charged him with it, and he has denied it and accused me! I see that by his looks. I think I know my way out now.' What this way was, which the Junior Partder seemed to see so clearly before him in this crisis of affairs, will be explained in the next chapter.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER VII. `I am anticipated, I see gentlemen,' said the Junior partner, speaking with extraordinary assurance, and walking up to the bank counter. `Anticipated? How do you mean, sir?' asked Dr. Elmore, fixing his eyes upon him sternly, while the others waited the result with curiosity and impatience. `A sad affair; very!' responded the Junior Partner shaking his head and glancing out of his eye towards Mr. Hart, and then looking confidently round upon the faces of others. `I was in hopes to be here in time to prevent an exposure; but I see it is all out. I would have saved the credit of the house if I could. But it is too late, I see! Very sad affair, gentlemen! Pray how did you discover it?'— Here the fluent Junoir Partner glanced his eyes at the Cashier. `If you speak of these forged notes, Mr. Creech,' answered the Cashier, `the one held by the bank was unpaid at the hour due; and Dr. Elmore being near the notary spoke to him about it before protesting it.' `And you pronounced it a forgery, sir,' inquired Mr. Creech, turning full upon Dr. Elmore and addressing this gentleman with a countenance filled with well conceived indignation at the forgery. `Yes, sir,' answered Dr. Elmore, perfectly surprised at the new position affairs seemed to be tending to. `You did perfectly right, sir, perfectly right. I only regret, for the credit of the Firm, that I did not learn the forgery sooner. As soon as I discovered it I hastened at once to the bank to lift the note. But I see it is too late gentlemen.' `And you have only just discovered the note to be a forgery, sir?' demanded Dr. Elmore, showing him the note. `Not ten minutes ago. It was by a mere accident. A singular accident, very! You must know, gentlemen, we have been a little run of late, and have had to get notes discounted, oftener than was safe. Well, you see gentlemen, this morning we had this note to pay, a note Mr. Cashier, I presented two months since for discount. You recollect it no doubt, that it was I that presented it, and that I also drew the money.' `Yes, sir,' answered the Cashier, his confidence in the integrity of Mr. Creech greatly increased by the other's open, can did manner. `Well, I did not know up to eleven o'clock how we should meet this note. I knew all our funds were invested. I asked Mr. Hart what should be done? He made no reply; but went out into his counting room. From his gloomy looks, I was confident, gentlemen, that he had made no provision to meet the note. I trembled, I assure you for the credit of the House of Hart &amp; Creech. I did, I assure you, gentlemen! A Protest, a Pistol! That's my creed, gentlemen! I am too honorable to survive a protest!' Here the Junior Partner laid his hand over his heart and looked round to receive the silent admiration he felt they could not withold from a man who so carefully regarded his honor. `Well, gentlemen, I walked the store, thinking for about ten minutes, and then I went into the counting-room determined to know what was to be done. Said I, `Mr. Hart, if you have made no provision to meet Dr. Elmore's note due to-day, why have you not let me know sooner, so that I could look after it. I entrusted it to you. He smiled and said to me, `Mr. Creech, you can do so with entire confidence. What is the amount of the note due to-day?' `It is ten thousand dollars,' said I. `There is a note for the amount drawn by the same name. Take it to W — and get the money. The balance for the discount will be found in the safe. Did you not say so, Mr. Hart?' Abruptly challenged in this manner, and wholly confounded and overwhelmed by the statement of Creech, Mr. Hart (who it will be remembered said these very words to him) remained silent. `I ask you, sir, did you not say these words to me?' `You are a villain, sir,' replied Mr. Hart, looking ghastly and shaking his trembling fist at him. Creech smiled scornfully and looked round in triumph. `You see, gentlemen, he does not deny it.' In the opinion of all present, Henry Hart was the criminal. Mr. Creech was looked upon as an honest man. Mr. Hart felt the dark looks of all upon him and hung his head. The boldness of his Junior Partner overwhelmed him. He sat as if a spell was upon him. Mr. Creech then continued, `He gave me the note, gentlemen, and I went out to negotiate it. I took it to you, Mr. W —. You discounted it for me. I returned with the money to the counting-room—' `A moment, if you please, sir,' said Dr. Elmore. `Certainly, sir,' answered the Junior Partner, bowing with easy and condescending politeness. `Do I understand you that this was the second note bearing my signature for the sum of ten thousand dollars; which you got discounted?' `Yes, sir. The first here at the bank; and the second to day with Mr. W —.' `And had you no suspicion that either of the notes were forged?' `None whatever, sir! I feel I ought to regard such a question as an insult, sir. But I pardon it. When one's name is forged, there is an excuse for unguarded words.' `I meant no offence, Mr. Creech.' `I have taken none, sir.' `Go on if you please, will you?' exclaimed the broker impatiently grinding his teeth together and darting savage glances towards Mr. Hart, who felt that any efforts of his owu towards arresting the tide of feeling in Creech's favor and against himself would be unavailing. `I placed the money in Mr. Hart's hands, who I saw was very solicitous to take up the note in person. I could not account for it then. It is now very plain. He left the counting-house a little before close of bank hours, and said he was going to the bank to take up the note. Half an hour afterwards I was drying a letter on the blotter when an impression very legibly made upon it arrested my eye. I took out a pocket mirror to glance at it lest it should be something secret relating to the Firm, and well knowing Clerks get a good many secrets by reading the blotting book with mirrors, when to my surprise I found it was the impression of a note of hand signed by Dr. Elmore, for some thousands of dollars. The sum and date were not quite so legible as the rest. Now I well knew Dr. Elmore had not been in the counting-room and that Mr. Hart told me he got the note signed at the Doctor's residence. Now, said I, this this is strange. How could a man write his name and dry it on our blotter who has not been in the store: and who, as Mr. Hart says, did not write it in the store but at his house! The writing of the note was in Mr. Hart's hand, but the signature that of Dr. Elmore. Yet both dried at the same time. Now, said I, either Dr. Elmore was here and signed that this morning, while Mr. Hart wrote it, or the signature is a forgery.' `But Dr. Elmore might have been there the day before.' `Not for six months before without my seeing him, or knowing it. I am always in the counting-room. Dr. Elmore can answer that question.' `I have not been in Mr. Hart's counting-room for three years at least,' answered Dr. Elmore, who had listened with the deepest attention to Creech's singular statement. `And this blotting paper led you to suspect that the note Mr. Hart had given you had been drawn up and signed by himself?' asked the Cashier. `Yes. The instant this painful suspicion flasbed upon me I thought of the note due in Bank—of Mr. Hart's anxiety to take it up in person, and I could not but believe that it was also a forgery! Judge my feelings, gentlemen! A partner in a mercantile house discovering circumstances that lead him to suspect the honesty of his co-partner. A most delicate and trying position. If they were forgeries, there was my own name and reputation involved! What proof could I bring of my innocence of all participation? Such were my reflections! While I was thinking upon this subject a person informed me that Mr Hart had fallen in the bank door and been removed to his house insensible! My first thought was —`Had he paid the note?' I thought most, gentlemen, of the honor of the House at that moment. I flew hither to learn its fate. If fortunately taken up to inform Mr. Hart of my knowledge of his guilty proceedings, warn him against their repetition and demand that he should at once obtain funds to take up the note held by Mr. W—. Such was my intention, gentlemen, in coming to the bank. If I had found the note unpaid it was my intention to stop its protest for an hour or two till I could raise money and get it into my possession. On my entrance I found you all here. The looks of both parties showed me at a glance that I was too late! If possible, gentlemen, let the affair rest between us! Indignant as I naturally feel I do not care to have the matter blazed abroad. Mr. Hart's fall, no doubt alone prevented him from lifting the note. He has probably got the money about him now which I obtained for the purpose.— Let me propose, that this be paid to the bank for the note held; and that Mr. W— take the note of the Firm to secure him, with, if he pleases, a mortgage upon Mr. Hart's house.' This last audacious proposition made Mr. Hart, guilty and fallen as he felt, start with an exclamation of indignant astonishment. He, however, only half rose from his chair and then sat down again muttering something which no one understood. `The Bank cannot receive money so obtained, Mr. Creech,' said the Cashier. `But I can receive it,' answered the broker. `It is mine! I will have it! The note of your firm you may give to the bank, if you please!' `Mr. Creech will not insult the bank by offering the note of a house so dishonored,' answered Dr. Elmore. `Pardon me, Mr. Creech, in using this term I do not reflect upon you.' `No, sir. Innocence never suspects! I did not mistrust that you did, Dr. Elmore.— You speak truly. Our house is dishonored.— It shall be my first act to have cancelled the papers of our co-partnercy. I cannot too soon leave a position in which I am disgraced.' `Mr. Hart give me up my money!' demanded the broker going towards the Merchant, who, although Creech's account was rife with falsehood, had felt there was too much truth in it, for him to attempt to exculpate himself. `Stay Mr. W —,' said Dr. Elmore— `There will be an officer here in a few minutes.' `I will be my own officer,' answered the broker, seizing Mr. Hart by the collar. `My money, sir!' `It is in this pocket-book, Mr. W—' he answered, placing it in the broker's hands. With a smile of joy Mr. W— flew to the counter with it and began to run over the amount. There was just ten thousand dollars, which he announced to all. This intelligence corroborated the Junior Partner's story; and the fact that with this sum in his pocket book he was coming to take up the forged note, was a confirmation of his guilt and of the truth of Mr. Creech's account. All present believed the latter innocent and the former alone criminal. `Here is the amount of discount, sir,' said the overjoyed broker on recovering his money; and placing the hundred dollars back in the pocket book he returned it to Mr. Hart, transferring the nine thousand and nine hundred dollars to his own. `You are satisfied now, Mr. W—, I trust?' asked Mr. Creech, smiling. `Quite so, Mr. Creech,' replied the happy broker laughing and heartily shaking the Junior Partner by the hand. `But a sad affair this for poor Hart.' `Very.' At this moment an officer of Police came into the bank. He was a stout built man of the middle height, well knit together and of compact frame. He wore a box overcoat and fur cap. His face was florid full, and might be called handsome. Its expression was of mingled good feeling and determination; courage and gentleness combined!—the very compound for a police officer, whom most people (and themselves too sometimes) think must be a brute. The officer glancing round rested his eye longest on Creech, which was an attention this gentleman by no means felt flattered by. But Police officers are physiognomists. In his mind the officer set the Junior Partner down as his man. He, however, walked strait to the counter where stood the Cashier who had sent after him. `An unpleasant occurrence, Mr. Clapp.' `What is it?' he asked, glancing again penetratingly at the Junior Partner. `A forgery.' `Who is the complainant? The criminal I think I see here.' `The Bank; and others also.' `Did you bring a warrant with you?' `Yes.' `Dr. Elmore shall you prosecute?' This gentleman was at that moment painfully regarding the unhappy Henry Hart; who from the moment the police officer entered had sunk his head upon his breast and sat with his hands clasped together the very picture of hopeless despair. Dr. Elmore was thinking of his family, and deeply commisserating them. He also was thinking upon his wife, his children—for whom he had given his hand to crime, with the bitterest agony that could torture the human bosom. `Shall you prosecute, Doctor Elmore?' repeated the Cashier. `No,' he answered with feeling. `And you Mr. —,' he asked of the partner of the house whose endorsement had been forged. `Most certainly we shall prosecute, answered Mr. W— with great positiveness. `The Bank will do so also, as it will be the only loser by the forgery. Mr. Clapp you will take into custody Henry Hart, now in this room, and safely keep him until the will of the Directors is known.' `With what do you charge him, sir?' asked the officer, looking towards Creech, who a third time meeting the eye of the constable, lost his audacity, looked really guilty. `With a forgery.' Mr. Hart was seated and partly hidden by the form of Dr. Elmore, who had turned to speak to him with reference to his family.— The officer did not therefore regard him on whom the Cashier's eyes had turned; but without hesitation walked strait up to Mr. Creech and laid his hand upon his shoulder. The Junior Partner started and turned pale. `You mistake, sir,' he said trying to smile. `There is your prisoner!' and he pointed to Mr. Hart. The officer looked towards the Cashier for explanation. `You are wrong, Mr. Clapp! The gentleman in the chair.' The officer bowed an apology which the Junior Parter graciously accepted, and approaching Mr. Hart, arrested him. The merchant moved not. With his face in his hands he groaned heavily and then rose up. `He is too ill to be taken to prison, sir,' said his physician. `He has just received a severe fall and is still suffering from the effects of it. Perhaps it could be arranged ao that on could remain with him to-night at his redence.' `This arrangement can be made,' answered Dr. Elmore with praise philanthrophy. The gentlemen present will consent to it.— desides it would be grateful to his poor wife to have him with her a little longer. You can keep him in safe custody there, Mr. Officer.' `Yes.' `You shall be well remunerated for your time.' `I only desire to do my duty. If the physician here says it would be dangerous to lodge him in prison to-night, and the prosecutors will give me permission to keep guard over him in his own dwelling, I am perfectly willinh to comply with their wishes.' The same carriage which had brought Henry Hart to the Bank, now departed with him in the custody of a police officer and his physician, to which said party Dr. Elmore also added himself, that he might in person, before they entered the house, gently break to his wife, the painful intelligence of her husband's fall from integrity and honor.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER VIII. We will briefly pass over the heart-rending scene that took place in the house of Henry Hart on his arrival there in the custody of an officer of police. Gently as Dr. Elmore had endeavored to prepare his wife for the blow, it came upon her mind with such force that she became nearly insensible. Devotedly attached to him who had always been to her a kind husband and to his children a fond father, she could not at first comprehend that he was a criminal and in the hands of justice—she could not believe that he whom she had looked upon as the very soul of honor, as the model for an honorable merchant, could have fallen! `Forged! forged a note? forged names of others in Bank? Did you utter these words, Doctor Elmore? Say I fancied I heard them! Say I did not hear them. Tell me you did not speak them!' and she caught both his hands in hers and wildly, earnestly clasped them in hers and gazed in his face as if she would read there life or death. `Be calm, madam, I entreat you. It is, alas, too true!' `True! oh, God! true! Tell me it is true that my husband is a forger and then bid me be calm! Where is he? Where is my husband? Where is Henry? Have they dragged him to prison?' `No. He is in the hall with the officer.— But be calm! Be composed, dear madam, at least for your children's sake!' She rushed to the door of the drawing room, Dr. Elmore had sent for her with the request to see her there alone. She threw it nervously open and beheld her husband. Regardless of the presence of the officer and physician, forgetful of his crime, she bounded forward and threw herself wildly into his arms. Self-condemned, broken and degraded the miserable husband hardly dared to return the embrace. He stood passive, his face covered with the palm of his hand, while she bathed the other with tears and covered it wish kisses. `This—this is too much!' he cried in a sudden burst of agony. `If you had spurned me —if you had hated me, Ann! I could have borne it! But to be thus loved, guilty wretch that I am, is too much for me to bear!' These words were heard by Dr. Elmore and his physician with surprise. Both had some hopes yet of his innocence. But he had now, under the impulse of his feelings made a direct confession of his criminality. Dr. Elmore turned away with a sad heart. The last hope was gone. From his own mouth had come the voluntary confession of his guilt.— His heart bled for the wife—the still young and beautiful wife and mother, who clung to the guilty man with a devotion which rose superior to every consideration of unworthiness in the object. The love of a wife is like the love of God. No crime—no unworthiness—no degree of moral guilt can move it from its object. There remained yet a new trial to the merchant's feelings—the trial of his paternal heart. The younger children, whom we have introduced to the reader in the first chapter of this truthful tale, to which they are desired to refer, the curly headed handsome Tommy of eight years, and the sylph-like Grace two years younger, now came in from the nursery, where an intelligent nurse performed also the part of a governess to them. Hearing, in the midst of their lesson the uplifted voice of their mother in the hall, they ran down stairs in alarm to learn the cause. Ellen, the eldest daughter, also flew from her room where she was engaged in coloring a landscape. The younger children seeing their parents overwhelmed with grief, and unable to comprehend the cause, clung around them and mingled their cries with their tears. Ellen stood a moment transfixed with surprise and painful alarm as she saw the gentlemen gathered round them. She recognized both Dr. Elmore and the physician; and then she feared her father had been hurt. It may be necessary to observe here, in passing, that the servant whom Mr. Creech had seen at the door, had been so discreet as not to alarm the family by reporting Mr. Creech's words respecting the accident, whom he believed had been misinformed, knowing if Mr. Hart had really been hurt his wife would hear of it full soon enough Her father's paleness confirmed her in this idea, and full of affectionate solicitude the beautiful girl flew towards him. She was arrested by the gentle grasp of Dr. Elmore upon her wrist. She turned a look of earnest inquiry upon him. `Ellen, my child! come with me a moment into this room,' he said in a tone that sunk to her heart. She felt a weight oppress her very soul at his words. She turned, she knew not why, a look of timidity and awe towards her father and then suffered him to lead her into the parlor. She instinctively felt that some evil had befallen the household—some sorrow greater than any accident to life or limb! The faces of all around—the anguish of her mother— the gloomy and fallen countenance of her father—all were eloquent with some woe, her young heart could not divine—but the apprehension of which made her tremble like a leaf, as she gave her hand into that of the benevolent old gentleman. As she went with him she met her mother's gaze! It was full, all full of woe and pity! He closed the door and led her to a seat.— She thought she should suffocate. The shadows of the cloud of woe fell darkly over her spirit. He took a seat by her side. What fearful communication was about to be made? She clasped his hands and looked into his face with the most pleading deprecating expression. She could not speak; but her looks said, `Oh tell me nothing evil! tell me noth ing that will break my heart, as I know my mother's heart is broken!' Dr. Elmore understood her emotion. He tried more than once to speak, but his feelings overcame him. The tears trickled silently down his venerable face and fell drop by drop upon the golden head of his staff. `Ellen, my sweet child, you must gather all your energies and be firm!' he said in a voice deeply moved. `What fearful thing has happened? My father!—it is of him you would speak! Oh, what is it, sir?' `It makes my heart bleed to tell you, but it is better you should know it and from me.' `Tell me all! I can bear it! Is it that he has lost his property? Oh, that is no evil, such as some nameless one I seem to dread! I can work and do much to support him! Tell me all! `Would it were but the loss of his property, sweet child! In a word, your father has lost his honor and good name!' `My father dishonored? It cannot be,' exclaimed the daughter with a noble spirit animating her face. `Alas, it is too true. He has been tempted to use the names of merchants without their permission,' said Dr. Elmore conveying to her the father's crime as delicately as he could `And is this a dishonor, sir? I do not quite understand it—but it may be so, sir,' she said thoughtfully. I do not know what it is to use a merchant's name without his permission.' Dr. Elmore saw that he had failed to convey to the young girl the idea he had intended. `Your father is accused of forgery,' he said as firmly as his emotion would permit. He saw that she now perfectly comprehended him. And painful indeed was the evidence which assured him of the fact. She sat before him without motion. Her eyes were fixed rigidly upon his face, but there was no expression there. They were as eyes of brilliant glass. Her cheek at the word had changed to the hue of marble. Her lips lost their color, but moved tremulously with the mechanical repetition of the scarce audible word which had acted so like an evil spell upon her. Doctor Elmore gazed upon her with intense alarm.— He condemned himself for abruptness.— He spoke soothingly to her. She gave no signs of intelligence. Only her lips moved with the repetition of the fatal word that had last fallen from his own. `Ellen! dear child do not let this sad news so deeply affect you!' `Forgery! forgery! forgery! forgery!' responded continually the statue-like figure before him, the voice thrilling the very soul with its low, touching pathos. He took her hands; they were as cold as those of the dead. He laid his hand upon her temples, which burned with unnatural heat. He raised her in his arms, and laying her upon the sofa, went to the door, and in an under tone called to a servant to send Dr Blake to him; those who were in the hall having gone into the library, the door of which was closed. On the physician's appearance, Dr. Elmore, who himself had not practised for many years, informed him briefly of Ellen's situation and its cause. A vein was immediately opened in the temples, friction applied to the hands, and in a little while the alarming symptoms disappeared. The rigid, unwinking eye fell and gently closed, the lips ceased to move, articulating the fatal word, and a state of total physical prostration succeeded, attended with partial insensibility. It became necessary to make known to the already sufficiently wretch-wife the condition of her child. Dr. Elmore went for her. He found her in the library. Henry Hart was laying utterly prostrated in body and spirit, upon a settee. She had placed the softest pillows beneath his head; and was now seated by him, soothing him with words of devoted love, every one of which pierced his soul like sharp steel, bathing his feverish temples, and by every solace in her power endeavoring to heal the bruised and guilty spirit. He could only lay and hide his face, and at intervals murmur an entreaty to be forgiven by her. `Think not of me, Henry,' she said `You have erred. You have sinned. We are all liable to be tempted—all liable to fall! God has seen fit to leave you to yourself. But he has not deserted you! Your wife still loves you. To her you can never be guilty, so long as the guilty are pardoned by our Heavenly Father! so long as remains on record this promise, `if any man sin we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the Righteous.' `Do not speak so kindly! I cannot bear the gentle tones of your voice, Ann!' `It is because you feel your guilt, Henry! This sense of unworthiness is the first step to repentence.' `I do sincerely repent. Not because I am detected—not because I have a prison and a trial before me—not because I have made myself a by-word among men, but for the grief and the woe and the anguish I have brought upon you—upon my dear children! I think not of my own personal degredation. It is swallowed up in the misery and disgrace my conduct has brought upon those I most love. And yet, I put my hand to this crime on your account—on their account! I was unfortunate—I was bankrupt. I could not contemplate the poverty and loss of position in society which would be yours, if I made known my affairs. I had not the courage to tell you we must leave this fine mansion and take humble lodgings; that you must sink to a level with the poor and the humble? I could not convey to your ears, Ann, intelligence so painful.' `Oh, that you had done so, Henry! You would then have escaped crime! You need not have feared for me? A wife who truly loves her husband will listen to his tale of sudden loss and poverty without any other feeling than for her husband. She loves herself in him. She will only feel for him, think of his unhappiness—of his fall of pride. Her heart will bleed for him; her sympathies will all be awakened in his behalf. What to the truly loving wife is money when her husband is unhappy? Oh, Henry, I would have listened to your tale of poverty so far as myself was concerned without any emotion or regret save only on your account' `Your children?' `Our lot would become their's! And Providence would be nearer to us than before. The poor have higher and holier claims on our Father who is in Heaven than the rich; hence it is a blessing to be poor if we only knew it and had faith and grace rightly to improve the blessing. Oh, Henry, how greatly have you erred in not coming to me from the very first. If you had told me of your embarrassments, I might have advised you. At least you would not have fallen into this fearful temptation.' `But, I did not think you understood any thing about business. You could not have comprehended my complicated business arrangements.' Women—wives especially who feel interested in thier husband's happiness, have more intelligence than men give them credit for. They view a subject even so mysterious as a merchant's business, in a calm, common sense, unprejudiced light, which often form a variety of causes he himself is unable to do. Besides, there is no subject will not be regarded in an entirely new aspect when for the first time presented to a mother's mind. A hundred avenues and ways and means which the merchant has overlooked may be discovered by the clear, calm judgment and feminine penetration of his wife. Besides, all men need advisers, and all sensible men feel the necessity of a person with whom they can at all times hold council. But few men are to be freely trusted. Who then so appropriate—so good a counsellor as a wife? Who so likely to give him honest council? You may say she has no knowledge of business. True. But her love and her devotion to her husband will be to her both wisdom and understanding.' `She openeth her mouth with wisdom; and in her tongue is the law of kindness. `She doeth him good and not evil all the days of her life. `The heart of her husband doth safely trust in her.' It was at this moment Dr. Elmore entered the room. The officer was standing by a distant window looking out. `I would speak with you a moment, madam,' said Dr. Elmore in a low voice. A sudden paleness spread over her features. She rose and silently left the room with him. Henry Hart followed her with this eyes and then covering his face groaned aloud, `Incomparable woman! Wretch that I am! Oh, that I had made a confident of my wife from the first! I should at least have been protected from crime! I am unworthy to be the object of her love! I could curse myself for my guilt! And my children! My sweet angel, Ellen! She has not come to see me! She avoids her father who has entailed upon her infamy! And my little ones! They looked upon me with fear and timidity and crept to their mother, as if already they understood that I was unworthy to be called their father! They have taken them away! I am alone—a prisoner! I do not wish to see them again! But Ellen!—that she, my heart's child— should shun me is a blow heavier than I can bear! But I deserve it! I am a forger! Should that pure innocent girl rest upon a forger's bosom? Officer!' `Sir.' `Take me hence to prison! I shall go mad here!' `Is it your wish?' `Yes. I cannot stay here surrounded by my family At once take me away! Look me in the darkest dungeon you can have access to! Shut me out from the light of heaven! What have I to do with the innocent and good around me! What have I to do with the pure sunshine!' Dr. Elmore took Mrs. Hart by the hand as he entered the hall, and said, `Madam, I am grateful to God who has endued you with such strength at this trying hour. Your fortitude surprises me and commands my respect. But you are yet called upon to suffer additional grief. Your sweet daughter on learning from me the painful intelligence was so overcome by the shock that she now lies in a very critical state.' `Where?' she asked with a calmness that led him to suspect that it was unnatural and the result of sensibility to the comprehension of any heavier grief. She read his thoughts and said with a gentle smile and upward glancing of her tearful eyes, `It is God—and he sustains me!' Dr Elmore bowed his silvery head before the majesty of Christian faith, and preceded her into the presence of her child.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER IX. We have now brought our chief character Henry Hart, to the crisis towards which his career had been gradually and steadily advancing. We have followed him from his first act of duplicity and criminal secrecy touching the deranged condition of his mercantile affairs, through all the subsequent acts it gave rise to, till forgery crowned them and detection and arrest followed. It is not our intention to indulge in reflections upon his moral turpitude, or dwell upon the danger of a first act of criminal duplicity. This story carries with it its own moral; and will suggest its own proper reflections in the mind of the reader. We shall now proceed to show the consequences of guilt, as affecting those who are cannected with the guilty by the ties of consanguinity. No man lives for himself, more particularly the husband and the father. When such fall, they pull down with them many a bright head, crush in their descent many a pure and guileless heart. Henry Hart, from his magnificent mansion, was removed to a prison. In the solitude of his cell he had time for reflection; and bitterly did he lament his first act of deception.— The thought of the wretchedness and infamy he had brought upon his wife and children acted like fire in his bosom. He was tortured which way soever his thoughts were turned. He strove to drown reflection; but each moment the pale face of his noble wife bending above him in silent agony, feeling more for him than for herself; the shrieks of his daughter; the wondering looks and timid gaze of his children rose ever before his mind's vision and drove him to madness! Thus he passed the first night of his incarceration. Scarcely less wretched was that spent within his princely mansion. In vain the gorgeous mirrors, the sumptuous tables of marble, the splendid carpets, the costly chandaliers, the lavish opulence and elegance of the drawing rooms, to comfort and assuage the grief of the stricken family. Yet to preserve this display—this outward show, had Henry Hart committed the crimes for which he was that moment in prison. Each object, on the contrary, as it met the hapless wife's eyes, as she hung over her child's couch, pierced her soul with pangs of distress. So the night wore away! the poor wife now weeping over her daughter, who would not be comforted; now mourning for her degraded husband torn from her by the stern power of offended justice. What reader will not say from his heart. `How much happier would this unhappy family have been at this moment occupying a single room in a poor tenement, with humble but honestly earned fare, than surrounded as they were by all the manifestations of wealth!' Yet to escape this humble poverty Henry Hart had put his hand to forged paper, and was now the occupant of a felon's cell. In no instance in the experience of mankind has a wrong act brought the happiness for the attainment of which it was committed; but on the contrary, has placed the doer of it in a more painful position than he was at the first. This is a truth, laid down by Holy Scripture and corroborated by the daily experience of evil doers. Let men in business, let men out of business, bear it well in mind? If Henry Hart had adopted and believed this truth, he would not have been, maybe a poor man, but he would have been a poor honest man! He was now poor— but alas! poor and guilty! We will briefly pass over the events succeeding his arrest. Dr. Elmore with noble disinterestedness offered himself his bail, which was set at the large sum of $10,000. But Mr. Hart firmly refused to be bailed out. `I have offended the laws. It is but just I suffer the full penalty due to my crime! Besides what have I to do in the world? Men have no more confidence in me! I am unworthy to be re-united with my injured family! Let me remain here in prison! These walls are in unison with my spirit.' But confinement, reaction of long excited feeling, united with deep remorse of conscience, after a few days brought on a violent attack of fever and delirium. Hour after hour did his faithful wife stand over his low couch in the prison, and administer to his wants. While the daily press, and the groups in the streets were loud in their condemnation and unspairing in their epithets, she who suffered most, murmured not, nor looked reproach. At length his disease grew alarming and his physicians removed him to the jailor's dwelling, where after suffering night and day for several days his erring career terminated in death. In the meanwhile his house and furniture were attached and a few days after his burial, were sold at auction to which flocked all the fashionable ladies in the city who were unfeeling enough to forget at what sacrifice of domestic happiness this mansion had been laid open to the public eye? How few sympathized with the disgraced and widowed Mrs. Hart, who, while her rooms were thronged with thoughtless purchasers, was with her children occupying a room in the basement bathed in tears. The same evening Dr. Elmore came for them in a carriage and took them to a small but neat house in a humbler part of the city, which with characteristic delicacy he had fitted up and plainly furnished with every comfort, but without any luxuries. Here, in the education of her children and assisted by Ellen in giving lessons to a few pupils whom her friend Dr. Elmore obtained for her, Mrs. Hart endeavored to forget her unhappiness and to find that solace in her children of which she had been deprived in her husband. None who knew her in her prosperity now came nigh her, and this neglect was to her sensitive mind a great relief. Her few acquaintances were formed among the humble and contented neighbors around her; and she sought to forget that she had ever moved in any other sphere. Dr. Elmore, whose name she taught her children to mingle with their little prayers and for whom the beautiful Ellen felt the affection of a child towards an honored father, used occasionally to visit them. He had wisely refrained from offering her any assistance beyond that of his first act of benevolence in placing them in their new abode, and getting her pupils; and he knew that such was the independent character of Mrs. Hart she would have refused any pecuniary aid he might have offered. Two years Mrs. Hart thus supported herself by teaching and her needle, assisted by Ellen, who had now become a remarkably beautiful girl of eighteen. There is, however, no certain repose to any one in this life.— Changes chase each other like the clouds, and vicissisitudes are as much the lot of man as sunshine and showers. Dr. Elmore had, doubtless, the intention in prospect in making his will to make such a bequest as should enable Mrs. Hart to live more easily; and perhaps settle upon her the tenement in which she lived, which was his own and which he had suffered her to occupy gratuitously. But this intention was prevented from being carried into execution. Dr. Elmore with all his benevolence of character and excellence as a man and a christian had in common with many men an undefined feeling of reluctance to making a will while in good health; as if from a secret fear that death would soon follow. He, therefore, put it off from year to year, anticipating a gradual decline which should both forewarn him of approaching dissolution and give him time to arrange his affairs. `But man proposes and God disposes.' One pleasant spring morning as this gentleman was leaving his dwelling to make a visit to Mrs. Hart, to inform her that he had obtained a very desirable situation for Ellen as a governess, he fell upon the steps in an apoplectic fit, and being conveyed into the house died in a few minutes. The grief which the death of their benefactor caused the objects of his benevolence was sincere and profound. He had been to them like a father—and a friend. He was the centre around which their affections entwined themselves; the object of their purest gratitude. Circumstances soon proved to them how great a loss they had met with. Their benefactor stepping from the very first between them and the cold world, had turned aside its shafts from their breasts; and guarded by his friendly beneficence they had not suffered from their sudden fall and deep affiction, all that otherwise they would have experienced. But now they were destined to feel deeply and keenly the privations of friendless poverty; to which is added the heartless whisperings of the reproving, who with utter want of charity were disposed to heap upon the wife and children the infamy of the husband and father's act. Dr. Elmore's estate fell into the hands of administrators, his son Edward being at the time of his decease absent in Europe where, after completing his medical studies under his father's eye, he had gone for the purpose of completing his knowledge of surgery and me dicine in the Hospitals of Paris. Administrators, like corporations, are too often without souls. The administrators on the estate of Dr. Elmore were men of substance and respectability, business men, and familiar with their duties They went to work in a business way to settle up the estate. It may truthfully be said of them as Scripture said of the Pharaoh who ruled after Joseph's death: `And now there rose up a new king over Egypt who knew not Joseph.' These men knew not the widow of Dr Elmore's beneficence. In the investigation of the real estate the tenement occupied by Mrs. Hart was found to be a portion of it. They learned that it had been two years occupied by a Mrs. Hart —widow of the notorious Henry Hart, who had been imprisoned for forgery and died before trial. `Ah, I am surprised Dr. Elmore should have rented a house to such a person,' said Mr. Straitpurse, who was a man of money being a bank-director; who was a man of piety; being a church member and notorious for long prayers at the monthly concerts; and a man of feeling; for he felt for every poor body, and all they got was feeling! `We must see into it, and see if the rent has been regularly paid on quarter day.' `Suppose we call by as we go down to State street. The house is in our way: and I should like to see personally all the property that comes under our control,' said Mr. Straitbrim; who had been a wholesale grocer and was now President of an Insurance Compapany. Finding in his outset in life religion convenient he passed for a quaker on the faith of his grandfather, who had been of that sect; and he therefore, wore a low strait collar to his coat and a white cravat tied very precisely in a single bow in front; a white hat something broad in the brim; and drab pantaloons. Thus he let his garb go in the world's eye in the place of religious profession; and under the mark of rigid morality enriched himself by ways and means that would not stand very well the test that will analyse human motives and actions at the final judgement. Such were the Pharisees into whose hands Mrs. Hart had fallen. She was seated in the lower back room of the little two story house which Dr. Elmore's benevolence had sheltered her and her little ones in from the storms of a heartless and finger-pointing world, sewing upon a garment she had taken to make, and feeling deeply her loneliness, and the entire dependence of her children upon her feeble efforts; Ellen was in the same room practising, with a sad heart, upon a piano, Dr. Elmore had hired for her, a piece of difficult music she was to teach her pupils that afternoon. Tommy and Grace, the first in his eleventh year and the other nine, were at public school—that noble institution of our free land, which is the foundation of its greatness and power; where the poorest can obtain knowledge side by side with the rich; the son of the wood-sawyer drink in wisdom and strength at the same fountain with the `merchant prince!' The room was furnished very plain but perfectly neat; and a few flower pots of rose geranium and heliotrope were in the windows. Mrs. Hart though pale and serious had lost none of her refined beauty, which was re vived in her daughter, than whom few maidens in Boston were more lovely. Her person was singularly graceful, and though she wore a calico dress, no one would have noticed that it was not of the richest cashmere; for her face alone drew the attention of the observer. It was refined in character, and purity and gentleness dwelt there as if in their native heaven! Her smile was full of sweetness, and her fine blue eyes beamed with intelligence and feeling. Her face was intellectual without being severe; it was wisdom blended with love. Her complexion was brilliant, and the soft glow of her cheek rivalled the rose in delicacy of color. But the chief beauty of Ellen Hart was her glorious cloud of hair. Its hue was neither brown, nor auburn, nor chesnut, but a blending of the three with a golden radiance that played richly upon it at every movement of her head. It was not its hue alone that made it beautiful! It was of the softest texture, and when in sportiveness little Grace would come behind her as she sat at the piano and steal out the comb that scarce held its rich weight, it would fall like a mantle over her shoulders and sweep the floor! She had worn it free on her neck until she was fifteen, when its length compelled her to bind it up. It was now braided and tastefully intertwined, braid within braid, fold within fold, and fastened in a sort of quadruple bow, resting low upon her neck; a style as tasteful as it was graceful. They were thus occupied, mother and daughter, when a knock was heard at the door.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER X. The knock on the door was heavy and peremptory. It was one of those authoratative knocks that are peculiar to landlords on poor tenant's doors. Before Ellen could leave her piano stool to answer it, the door opened and in walked the two administrators, Mr Straitpurse first and Mr Staitbrim following him and closing the door behind them. He walked through the little entry into the small back room without invitation, Ellen retreating from before them in awe and curiosity. `Who could those two cold stern looking men be? and what could they want?' were her rapid, alarmed self-inquiries. Mrs Hart at once recognised the former, having in her better days been on terms of visiting with his lady. She rose up with a fluttering heart, and that instinctive foreboding of evil which the unfortunate and unhappy are so quick to feel, and with something of her former grace and dignity offered them chairs, all the while wondering to what circumstance she owed the honor of their visit. `Hum! ahem!' grummed and hemmed Mr Straitpurse, as he looked frowningly around the neat little apartment and upon the open piano, the flower pots in the window, and one or two small-framed pictures of Ellen's skill and taste over the mantle. Mr Straitpurse thought poor people of necessity must be squalid, have every thing unpainted, discolored, dank and uninviting; and generally the poor have little heart to keep things neat, and have little practical knowledge of economy. But to the educated poor, neatness is as cheap as untidiness; and over poverty good taste throws a veil that not only conceals wretchedness but gives a simple elegance. The comfort and cleanliness of this little setting room; the driven whiteness of the half curtains and the white fringed diaper that covered the bureau; the order and neatness in the furniture, conveyed to this gentleman the idea of extravagance and expenditure quite beyond what he supposed the means of a woman who had not paid rent for two years would authorise. He, therefore, grummed and knitted his brows and after frowning at the piano, the flowers, and the pictures, he cast a frowning glance both at Mrs. Hart and her daughter, and took the chair she had so politely placed for him. Mr. Straitbrim also looked round with a shrewd, inquisitive eye upon the room and the inmates, looked at Mr. Straightpurse, caught that gentleman's eye, and then both gentlemen `ahemmed' very significantly and decidedly. Ellen in the meanwhile had retreated to her piano-stool, from which she sat looking with surprise and anxious alarm at the two strangers; whose appearance cast a cloud over their little home, and chilled her young heart with sad forebodings. Mrs. Hart had seen their glances around the room, their frowns, and their interchange of looks. She resumed her seat in the low rocking chair which she had before occupied, with a chill at her heart. Mr Straitbrim did not sit down. This gentleman was of opinion that he spoke with more authority and power in a standing posture than a setting one; and as he was a tall man he certainly had the advantage of looking down upon most to whom he spoke, especially females and small men, whom he took a special pleasure in talking down to, I mean if they were poor and in his power, or wanted favors of him. `Ahem!—hum-hu-hu-grumm!' commenced Mr. Straitpurse looking across the narrow space between himself and Mrs. Hart, and trying to overawe this lady in the outset. `Hum, hum, humguphum!' echoed Mr. Straitbrim, increasing the emphasis of his echo, by bringing his silver-headed cane down upon the floor with a force that made Ellen's heart jump to her mouth. Mrs. Hart felt something was to follow these premonitory signals, which would call upon her for resolution and that christian patience which had sustained her thus far through the bitter trials which had been hers. She silently sent a petition to heaven for strength to meet whatever new evil might now be sent upon her. She felt at once composed, and prepared to listen. `Madam, your name is Hart,' said Mr. Straitpurse. `Yes, sir.' `Your husband was Henry Hart, the Forger?' `Sir, I am the widow of Henry Hart,' she answered with a calm dignity (while her heart swelled) that had its effect upon the interrogator. He colored and looked at Straitbrim, who said boldly— `Madam, we did not expect to find you retaining any pride. Sorry to see it in your condition. Henry Hart was a forger and died in prison. You are his widow and it does you little credit in the eyes of the respectable members of the community to endeavor to conceal it!' Here Straitbrim looked at Straitpurse for approval. Straitpurse nodded the expected approving nod; for both were respectable members of the community! `Gentlemen, if you have called upon me on business,' said Mrs. Hart with firmness, while she keenly felt the insult, `I should be happy to listen to you. But I cannot sit here to have my feelings wounded.' `Tut, tut, madam,' said Mr. Straitpurse `you must not put on airs. A forger's widow is a forger's widow! We have come to see you on business. We are the administrators on the estate of the late Dr. Elmore!' At the mention of this venerated name Mrs. Hart turned pale and sighed deeply. `You knew him, madam?' asked, or rather affirmed, Mr. Straitbrim, in a much stronger voice than the simple words he spoke required. But Mr. Straitbrim always spoke to the poor and the unfortunate in a loud, strong voice. `Yes, sir, I owe to him every thing. He was my best benefactor.' `Humph! no doubt! This house is his in which you are living?' and he glanced up at the ceiling and around at the windows and wainscoating. `It is, sir,' answered Mrs. Hart with an effort; for the sense of pending affliction weighed heavier and heavier upon her soul. `As administrators of Dr. Elmore's property it becomes us to look up all that belongs to him and the debts and rents due him. We would, therefore, ask you, madam, at what rent you have hired this house of the late Dr. Elmore, and if you are in arrears for rent and how much?' Mrs. Hart became paler still. `Rent, sir! Indeed, gentlemen, I shall not be able to answer this question to your satisfaction. Dr. Elmore charitably placed me and my family in this house, after my husband's decease, and bade me regard it as my own. This is but one of his numerous acts of benevolence of which I or mine have been the grateful objects.' `Dr. Elmore while living could do as he pleased with his property,' answered Mr. Straitbrim, looking down upon her with a majestic frown; `but we, who are administrators, have only one course to pursue.— Men, if they would have their own minds and intentions carried out, must look after the disposition of their property before they die. Dr. Elmore, you say, said this. But have you papers to show it?' `No, sir.' `How long have you tenanted the premises?' `Two years next Saturday!' `During this time what rent have you paid?' asked Mr. Straitpurse emphatically. `None, sir.' `None?' repeated Mr. Straitbrim. `None!' echoed Mr. Straitpurse. `Two years and no rent,' exclaimed Mr. Straitbrim. `No rent in two years!' repeated Mr. Straitpurse. Then both gentlemen exchanged glances; shook their heads, and ahemmed very positively. The two administrator's having thus expressed their mutual astonishment, bent their two pair of eyes upon the widow, who felt as if she were a criminal arraigned before two judges. Ellen all the while sat upon the piano-stool pale and attentive to all that passed. `We see by the late Dr. Elmore's papers, madam,' said Mr. Straitbrim, `that this tenement rented the year previous to your occupying, at one hundred and seventy-five dollars per annum; a very pretty sum these hard times. This for two years, amounts to—let me see? twice 5 is 10; twice 7 is 14 and 1 to carry is 15; twice 1 is 2 and one is 3. It amounts to just $350 for the two years rent up to next Saturday, madam.' `Exactly,' said Straitpurse. `A very pretty sum indeed these times.' `Money is worth, too 1 1-2 per month. `I got 2 per cent for it yesterday. `Ah, did you! Now, madam, there is interest to be calculated which will make it some $370, at a rough guess! This amount we regard you as indebted to the estate of the late Dr. Elmore unless you can show legal instrument from his hand quitting rent for this period of time.' `We are sorry, madam,' said Mr. Straitpurse, seeing the lifeless cheek and trembling agitation of the widow, `we are very sorry to give you any trouble! No doubt Dr. Elmore's intentions were very good, and as you say; but we are administrators, and as such, have no discretionary power. Dr. Elmore, as we just said, living could do as he pleased with his property, but dead, administrators must do as the law says. Very sorry, madam, very!' `Very indeed, but it is our duty to find you in this debt, and we shall be under the necessity of securing it, madam.' `Gentlemen,' cried the widow, clasping her hands in despair, `have mercy upon me! I have no means to liquidate so fearful a debt! Alas! that good Dr. Elmore's intentions towards the widow and the fatherless should be thus dreadfully thwarted.' `Tears and hand-wringing, madam, are of no use,' said Straitbrim. `Women always do this in trifles! It is their natural weapons? This debt is a just one. You cannot avoid paying it.' `But I have no means!' `Means! humph!' ejaaulated Straitpurse, glancing at the piano, which Ellen had deserted to sit by her mother and take her hand, partly as if for protection, partly to console her. `You certainly seem to be living in good style here for a woman who lives in a charity house! That piano is an enormous luxury! It will pay half the debt, madam.' `Not quite, I should think, Mr. Straitpurse,' said Straitbrim, walking up to it and examining it; `it seems some worn, and pianos are cheaper than they were. It might bring a hundred at auction. I gave five hundred for that one of my daughter's; but then that was a very different affair!' `Gentlemen, the piano is also a mark of Dr. Elmore's bounty. He hired it from a music store and sent it here for my daughter!' `Humph!' ejaculated both administrators. `Dr. Elmore was a weak man in some things,' said Straitbrim to Straitpurse. Mr. Straitpurse nodded, and then both gentlemen exchanged glances. `A very unnecessary luxury, madam, for a poor woman! You ought to have come down in your notions by this time,' said Mr. Straitbrim. `Your daughter would be better employed knitting stockings or working in a factory.' `She understood music well, gentlemen, when Mr. Hart died, and Dr. Elmore sent this piano to her to enable her to give lessons. He also obtained several scholars for her! With these she has greatly contributed to the support of herself and brother and sister.' `There is furniture here that looks nice! This is not hired too!' asked Straitpurse sneeringly. `It is mine, sir. The wreck of my poor husband's property,' she answered, too much overcome with the prospect of wretchedness before her to notice his tone. `How much property do you think you have in the world, Mrs. Hart?' asked Straitbrim, after looking round the room. `Certainly, gentlemen, all I am worth would not sell for $100.' `There is a parlor, is there not?' he asked, opening the door into a neatly furnished room. `Yes, sir. It was already furnished by Dr. Elmore when I came into the house.' `Oh, ah! very well! Then it can remain with the house,' answered Straitbrim ironically, and smiling at Straitpurse, who smiled also very sagaciously and said, `Very well, madam. As the house and all the furniture is Dr. Elmore's we shall of course claim it, as administrators. We were not aware of this property before. So, if you please, we will lock up the parlour? This afternoon I will send for the furniture, unless —' here he stopped and looked very grave, `unless you conclude to retain the house after paying up arrears; in which case we can rent you the furniture. Very sorry, madam. Tears are easy shed and easily dried? We are men of business, and must act accordingly.' `Gentlemen,' cried the widow, clasping her hands while the tears rolled down her cheeks, `what, oh what are you to do? What great evil is this that Dr. Elmore's death is to bring upon me and my children?' `We are very sorry? Can't do otherwise, madam,' said Straitbrim. `As I said before, we must do our duty. Can you pay this arrears of rent?' `No, sir! I have but two dollars and a quarter in money in the world! I earn scarcely three dollars a week and Ellen has but five scholars at four dollars a quarter, and this money has to clothe and support us. It is our all, save the little furniture and bedding we possess! Gentlemen, I and mine are in your power! I throw myself wholly upon your mercy and kindness. I plead not for myself, but for this weeping girl—for my two young children! You have acknowledged that you were satisfied that it was Dr. Elmore's intention to give me a gratuity of the rent! Why will you not then at least carry out, as his administrators, this intention! I ask not for extension of clemency beyond this time from you; I only implore to have the weight of the debt you have laid upon me removed! I will leave the house! I will seek a humbler abode! Only let me not be crush ed by a debt my benefactor never designed or anticipated would come upon the objects of his charities! You represent him! Oh, let not your acts turn into curses what he ordained as blessings upon me and mine!' As she ended this appeal, overcome by her fears for her children, she threw herself upon her knees before them! `Madam,' said Straitpurse, `no doubt your case is a hard one! But we see no way in which we can remedy it. The debt is just! We give you, also, formal notice to vacate the premises before Sunday morning. You need not trouble yourself to remove any thing but your immediate personal effects, as we shall consider it our duty to attach the furniture! Good day, madam!' `Good morning, marm,' added Straitbrim; `sorry it is so! We, doubtless, appear severe —but business is business! No blame can attach to us! Good morning, marm!' Thus speaking these two administrator's whom we have drawn from life, and whose names we can scarcely forbear writing out in full, left the house. They stopped a moment outside to survey its front and take a look at its general situation, and then walked together down town. The cant of these rich, heartless men, that they were `administrators,' that `they were doing their duty,' that `business was business?' was the argument of mean, avaricious, contemptible and heartless men! Both well knew that they could help it; that though there might no paper exist securing to the widow the gratuity of the rent, yet that it was evidently Dr. Elmore's intention it should be so, or he would have collected it, or placed another tenant in it. Still, although the Probate Court might call upon them in their official capacity to account for this arrears of rent, in the absence of any paper exempting the tenant from liability, yet, when they well knew Dr. Elmore's intention and that she was recipient of his bounty, it was their duty to have truly represented the case to the Court or have paid over the debt themselves; for they were both very rich men and what better investment could they have made of $350, than in carrying out so noble a charity as that of Dr. Elmore? For`he who lendeth to the poor lendeth to the Lord, and it shall be paid him again.' Certainly it could not be concealed from them that Mrs. Hart was very poor, and a fit object for their charity. But why do we reason, where such men as Mr. Straitpurse and Mr. Straitbrim are the parties? To give was not in their vocabulary!

We are now bringing this story to that crisis of events towards which it has been gradually tending from the first moment Henry Hart began to depart from the ways of integrity and uprightness. It was the afternoon of the day on which Mrs. Hart had received the visits of the administrators. The widow and Ellen, having yielded to the first shock of grief, were now more composed; and were calmly, though with tears in their eyes, talking over their gloomly prospects. Ellen was trying to be calm to compose her mother; the mother endeavoring to set an example of resignation to the child. Tommy and Grace, after their return from school at noon, had been sent again after their frugal dinner, their hearts free from the weight that oppressed their mother and sister, who refrained from informing them of the sad change that had befallen them all. `What shall we do, dear mother?' said Ellen after a few moments thoughtful silence, previous to which, every possible resource was called up and discussed without the prospect of giving them relief. What indeed should they do? Prejudice would be against the forger's widow, and they dared not appeal to any who had known Mr. Hart. To whom then could they apply? Their mode of life the last two years had been very retired; and Mrs. Hart had sought no intimacies. She knew none but the humble neighbors about her. `You ask a question, my sweet child, that God alone can answer,' answered the widow. `These administrators may think they are doing right, but right is not righteousness.— We are indeed wretched, Ellen. But let us not despair. We have a prospect of going to the almshouse, for there is nothing left to us! no house open to us!' She covered her face and wept. `God is in the alms-house, dear mother!' said Ellen in a tone of gentle faith; stooping and kissing her forehead as she sat. `Bless you, my child! That word has strengthened me! He is in the alms-house! and let us not forget it. I am cheerful again! Let us not fear, `for the widow and orphan are mine,' saith the Lord.' At that moment the door opened and Tommy and Grace came in from school. Grace was weeping, and she had her gown torn, and her face was flushed; and Tommy's cheek was bleeding, and his hand blood-stained; while his features wore a very determined look of defiance. `What is the matter? What new evil has befallen me in my children?' cried the mother, running first to Grace and then drawing Tommy to her. Are you hurt?' `I have been fighting,' said Tommy. `And I helping him, because the big boy was whipping him,' answered Grace. `Henry Talbot, because I got above him in the class, got angry and after school told me my father was hanged for forgery. I told him he lied: and then he struck me and we fought, and I whipped him: then another boy said I was a gallows-bird, and I struck him; and as he was twice as big as I am, he would have whipped me, as he got me down, if Grace had'nt helped me out by pulling me his hair! Didn't I do right, dear mother? To call my father a forger and say he was hung,' cried the excited, manly little fellow, from whom Mrs. Hart had carefully guarded from them the secret which would cast disgrace upon her offspring. Mrs. Hart made no reply. She gazed from one to the other and then sunk into her chair. exclaiming with anguish unspeakable, `Oh God, oh God! This is more than thy servant can bear! Oh Ellen, that the dear children had been spared this fearful knowledge! My heart will break!' `Mother, this is indeed bitterness! But all is rightly ordered. I feel as certain a trust in God as I do in you—nay stronger, for I know he can do what you cannot do! If you knew with what filial child-like confidence my heart is constantly going up to Him, knowing He will make all things work for our good, you would be as calm as I am! Do you suppose He does not see at this moment! you seated weeping in your chair, I kneeling by your side, Tommy and Grace standing there with the signs of their recent contest fresh upon them, and knows not all has caused our sorrow?— Does he not know from the beginning each event, and does he not know we are innocent, though, alas, my poor father may have been guilty! And will he suffer the innocent to perish? No! Be assured that out of this seeming evil of our lot He is preparing a good for us.' `You are a comforter, indeed, dear Ellen!' said Mrs. Hart, removing the blood for Tommy's cheek. `I will at least imitate your faith and fortitude, if I cannot possess them. Ah, there is another knock? I start as if I were a guilty thing. Yet I am only poor. `There is no guilt in poverty. The poor who trust in God are rich; for `the gold and the silver,' He says `are His. I will open the door.' `It is, I fear, the officers!' `Are we not prepared for them, dear mother, whenever they come! Let us not forget God is with us and will stand at our right hand though the officers stand before us.' The visiter was a short man with a light complexion, whity yellow hair, bushy eye-brows, small, thin mouth, scanty half-whiskers, pink edged eyes, and a pink cravat, and a striped pink and green vest; enormous ears; hair cropped short; black teeth and nails; and a very fashionable buckish white hat, green coat and drab pantaloons. He sported a huge cameo breast-pin of Napoleon's head, and a huge seal ring on his little finger, which he kept ungloved to display. As Ellen opened the door he bowed, simpered and said, `Ah, Miss Ellen how do you do?' He extended his hand to take hers, but she drew back and politely, but gravely said, `How do you do, Mr. Creech?' Be it here observed that Creech had been so successful as to turn aside from himself all suspicion in the public mind of being a party to the forgeries of his partner Henry Hart; but Dr. Elmore had suspected him, and also one or two others. But nothing was said to lead to any investigations of his conduct. He, however, informed Mrs. Hart that he suspected Mr. Creech had been the prime mover in the forgeries; and that if Mr. Hart had lived the trial would have revealed this to have been the fact. Creech, after the excitement had a little subsided, and the affairs of the Firm were adjusted, put a few hundreds he had saved from the general wreck into a retail dry-goods store in Hanover street, and began soon to make a noise with flashy, puffy advertisements in the newspapers. `Creech's, No. — Hanover street,' with `Great Bargains, selling lower than First Cost,' &amp;c., &amp;c., met the eye in all the Dailies. He kept his buggy and boarded at a stylish Hotel. Occasionally he had seen Mrs. Hart in the street, but he had forgotten her quite! But he hadn't forgotten Ellen! He had his intentions turned towards the young and blooming girl even when he was the partner of her father, and hoped one day by gaining her hand to get a position into the society to which, neither by birth, education, nor manners, he well knew he had no pretensions. Often since her father's fall he had passed her in the street and bowed; but she never recognized him; for she had been told by her mother that her father would not have been so erring a man if it had not been for Mr. Creech. The young and innocent heart of the child therefore instinctively revolted at the sight of the man. A few weeks before Dr. Elmore's death Creech met her, by accident, walking with him, and a certain design he had formed of calling on Mrs. Hart to cultivate the acquaintance of the beautiful Ellen: was promptly given up by him; for Creech had a great dislike to any thing like an encounter, or chance of an encounter, with Dr. Elmore, and he was not ignorant that the family of his partner was under his benevolent protection. We shall let Mr. Creech now explain for himself the reason of his present appearance. `Is your mother at home, Miss Ellen?' he asked, smiling as if to conceal his chagrin at the coldness of his reception; and gazing upon her with impertinent admiration. `She is, sir.' `I will step in and see her, if you please.' Ellen returned hastily to her mother and mentioned Mr. Creech's name. She had hardly done so before the Junior Partner followed her into the room. Mrs. Hart received him as civilly as was in her power, yet with a sinking of the spirit, for his presence seemed to be the forerunner of some new evil. `Sorry to hear the news, Mrs. Hart! Called down to see what I could do in the premises,' said the junior partner, taking a chair for him self, while Ellen and Mrs. Hart stood. `I met Mr. Straitpurse, and he told me how my late partner's widow was circumstanced, said he was very sorry, but it was all in the way of business. And men `in the way of business,' Mrs. Hart, you know have no knowledge of friends! Straitpurse seemed very sorry, but couldn't be helped. I am sorry too, I assure you, marm! I came down soon as I could, to see what I could do for you!' `Thank you, Mr. Creech, you are very kind,' said the widow gratefully! for Creech really spoke and seemed very kind and friendly; and she needed friendly words, poor woman. They opened her heart at once. `Not at all! I don't forget the widow and orphans of my old partner, if he did commit a slip of the pen! Accidents will happen to the best of men, Mrs. Hart; and the Junior Partner looked and seemed as if he thought in the course of human affairs such an accident might happen to him. `I called to see if you are really so bad off as Straitpurse said?' and he looked round the room, and then at them, inquiringly. `Yes, Mr. Creech. I don't know that I have any thing. This house and furniture are the bounty of Dr. Elmore. What few articles I could otherwise call my own, I am forbid to remove, as they are to be taken for rent!' Very, very sad affair,' said the Junior Partner shaking slowly his head, and glancing wistfully under his shaggy eyebrows at the beautiful Ellen. `I would be happy to serve you, if I could marm! But I am not very rich! I am, however, doing a little in the money making way! You've doubtless heard of Creech's store, No. — Hanover street! I can't say I'm rich; but then a friend's widow shall not suffer.' Mrs. Hart remembered her children, and her utter destitution, and forgot all her prejudices against Creech. Besides, he seemed to feel so much. `You are very good, Mr. Creech. `Don't thank me, marm! I like to do good without letting myself know it, if I could do so! I can't bear thanks! So you have no home?' he said with a sort of secret exultation. `No, sir; indeed, I have no home after we leave this.' `Nor no friends?' `None but tho friend of the widow and the fatherless!' she said with a glance of holy faith upward. `Humph!' ejaculated Creech; for he had little christian faith himself; and would not have lent the Lord a dollar by giving it to a poor man. `This is bad, very bad, marm! And you have no money?' `But a couple of dollars, and seven due Ellen by her scholars!' `Very bad, indeed.' Mr. Creech then looked down and was very thoughtful; while mother and daughter watched his features with anxiety, yet with a want of perfect confidence in the man.— But to whom else should they look. What other means of relief had they? And God they knew worked by means. Might not Mr. Creech be his instrument? Patiently and nervously they waited the issue of his meditations. At length he looked up and smiling upon Ellen said, `It mustn't be, Miss Ellen, that so lovely a girl as you are should be turned into the street! I always had a regard for you, when you was a child! I will now prove it to you and your mother! I have a small comfortable tenement which I had furnished for myself a few weeks ago to keep bachelor's hall in—for you know I am not a married man yet, Mrs. Hart. This has three rooms, one furnished as a parlor, one as a bed-room, and the other as a kitchen. Now I am willing to go back to the hotel and board, and give my rooms up to you Mrs. Hart until you can do better. It is only two squares from here and you can move what you want from here over there at any time. I will send a hand-cart for your things. Now, don't thank me, it confuses me.' Here the Junior Partner looked modestly down. Mrs Hart looked at Ellen with her eyes full of grateful tears, and then said, `Not to thank you would be more than I could consent to, Mr. Creech! Your kindness penetrates my heart! You have, indeed, proved yourself a friend at a time when most needed!' `I should have called on you long since, Mrs. Hart, with offers of service, but I knew you had Dr. Elmore your friend.' `Alas, he was indeed a friend.' `I hope I shall prove to be one also,' said the Junior Partner, diffidently, and at the same time looking tenderly towards Ellen, who by no means regarded him with favor. `I have no doubt you will, sir!' `Then I may consider my offer as accepted?' `I—really—indeed, Mr. Creech, I am at a loss how to reply! It is so great a favor— and I am so utterly beyond any way of making you a return!' `Don't speak of such a thing, Mrs. Hart,' said Creech disinterestedly. `It would make me so happy to be of service to you.' `Then I must for a while burden you, I fear; for I have no other resource when I leave here. To-morrow is Saturday, and the last day on which I can remain here.' `I will then send to-morrow for your things. If you are so reluctant to be under an obligation, I will charge you a trifling rent, which Ellen can pay with her needle, and that will make you feel independent.' `You are very good—too kind, Mr. Creech.' `So every body tells me, marm. But I can't help it! Good evening Mrs. Hart.— Good evening Miss Ellen! Ah, my little Grace and Tommy, you and I will yet be great friends!' The Junior Partner then tapped Tommy on the head, kissed Grace, and smiling with a tender glance and gallant bow towards Ellen, he left the house. Mrs. Hart turned with looks far brighter and mere cheerful than they had been for some hours, to Ellen and said, `I see, dear, we should never despair. Mr. Creech is indeed a friend raised up by God! You did not seem grateful enough, Ellen?' `I don't know, dear mother, but I can't get over my dislike to Mr. Creech.' `He can't be so bad as he has been represented, I think. What friend could have come more promptly, or offered more aid?— He even gives up his own rooms.' `Yes, mama!' `And charges us but a triflle of rent, in delicacy to my feelings.' `Yes, mama!' `And will let us remain there till we can do better.' `Yes, mama.' `Why, my dear child, what has possessed you! You look really more sad than before this sunshine.' Ellen said nothing in reply. She seemed instinctively to see a dark cloud ready to blot out the sun-light, and pour upon their devoted heads a storm. We shall briefly add in closing this chapter that the next day an officer took possession of Mrs. Hart's dwelling, and that Mr. Creech sent a hand-cart and a back for her to remove to his rooms. They found them cheerful and genteel; and Mrs Hart was gratified to find that in addition to the bed he had considerately added a trundle for the children. There was bread, and butter, and flour, and tea, and sugar, in the pantry: and potatoes and meat in the larder; wood in the closet, and crockery and cooking utensils, and everything needful, and that could contribute to their comfort. Their hearts were full of gratitude, and even Ellen's prejudices were removed.— In the evening Mr Creech came in to see how they were fixed and to take tea with them; and the board was a very social and happy one. Mrs Hart was now more than ever dependent; for she had no property not even in a chair or table. The hard-hearted administrators, Messrs. Straitbrim and Straitpurse, had distrained on all her worldly goods! She was now wholly dependent for house and furniture, and home, on Mr. Creech. Poor Mrs Hart! better would it have been for thee and thine to trust to the street `where God is!' than to the deceitful friendship of an unprincipled man. The succeeding, which will be also the last chapter, will unfold the nature of Mr. Creech's philanthropy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XII. We now carry our readers forward to a period three months later than the time at which the last chapter closed. During this interval the forger's widow had been an occupant of the rooms of the Junior Partner. At first, Mr. Creech would only call three or four times a week to tea, or pass the evening. At such times he used all his art to ingratiate himself into the good opinion of Mrs. Hart, and the good graces of Ellen. To Mrs Hart he made the present of a new dress; to Tommy of a new hat, and Grace a frock. Ellen firmly refused a gift of a beautiful pink hat he purchased for her in Tremont street. She could not overcome her suspicions of her father's partner. She felt grateful to him, but at the same time a feeling of repugnance. He saw he had made but slow progress in her favor; and that while Mrs. Hart had in him every confidence, and regarded him as her best friend, she was cold and avoided his society. Indeed he had never been able to be alone with her. On some pretence or other she would instantly rise and follow her mother, if she were called out of the room. Mr Creech became very much vexed and displeased; and at length resolved he would make plainer demonstrations. They had been three months, a quarter, in his tenement, during which time they had really been the dependents upon his bounty. Ellen felt this keenly, and worked at her needle night and day to earn money to enable them, at least, to eat one meal which was not composed of articles given by Mr Creech. Mrs Hart also worked early and late to be able to pay up the rent he should charge. One evening, three or four days after the end of the first quarter, Mr Creech dropped in upon his dependents. Mrs. Hart received him with gratitude, yet with that feeling of restraint which dependents can never overcome. Ellen rose, bowed politely, but without meeting his eyes, and handed him a chair. He looked for a moment round the room with a sort of embarrassed air, turned his hat up and looked at the marker's name with an absent manner, hummed a note or two and then said— `Mrs Hart, will you be so kind as to get me a glass of water.' `Certainly, Mr Creech,' she answered, rising. `No, I will go, mother!' said Ellen springing up.' `No, Miss Ellen, let your mother go. I would rather your mother would go for it!'— Mr Creech laid a sort of emphasis on the word rather. Mrs Hart nodded her head with slight reproval to Ellen, and left the room. Ellen looked as if she was about to follow her. `Excuse me, Mr Creech; my mother will have to draw the water; and she is not strong lately. I will help her!' `Stay, Miss Ellen,' said Creech, taking her hand. `I want an opportunity to say a word to you. I have tried to see you alone, but you seem to shun me. I wish to tell you that I adore you and that if you wish you can make me happy! I am well off! I can give you every thing that you want! I will help your mother, and brother, and sister! I will do everything to make you and yours comfortable, if you will consent to make me happy!' Ellen was thunder struck. She trembled. Her face grew pale as the marble! She struggled to release her hand. `I do not understand you, Mr Creech!' she said with an effort. `You cannot wish me to be plainer, Miss Ellen,' he said looking upon her with a significant air. `You are poor—your mother is poor and a dependant on my charity! You are disgraced by your father's act, and altho' you are beautiful you can never expect to get a husband! You had better, therefore, consent to embrace the offer I am making you and—' By this time the insulted maiden seemed to comprehend his unprincipled proposition!'— 'Till now she regarded him as seeking her hand in marriage. She started back from him as the infamous truth flashed upon her pure mind; and with a flashing eye and a heightened cheek she cried with indignant spirit— `Monster! Do you dare to insult me thus? I see that I have not feared you without true instinct! Dare to speak to me again in this manner, sir, and —' here she stopped, for she felt her impotency. `And what will you do? he asked with a sneer. `I will, as it is, sir, this very hour fly with my mother from your guilty roof! Is it for this that you have extended to wards us your benevolence?' `It is for this, Miss, answered Creech with malignant triumph. `From the first, enamored of your charms, I resolved you should be mine. I knew you would in your destitution fall to some one, and I resolved to be the possessor of so rich a prize! You need not be so proud and indignant! You must come to this at last, Miss Ellen! And you can find no one who will be so true a friend to you and yours as I will be!' Ellen stood silent—insulted—grieved—and overwhelmed with shame, confusion, and resentment! Tears at length gushed in torrents from her eyes, and covering her face she wept freely and bitterly. Had she lived to be the object of a proposition so vile! Had poverty then become a curse to them. Had God de serted them. Was their destiny in the hands of a monster. Alas, she felt that she had no more faith—no more hope. She was in despair. That hour she resolved to quit the roof which had only sheltered her and her mother as the price of her honor. `Oh God! to what shame and confusion am I brought!' she cried in her swelling heart. Creech approached her; for she had placed the breadth of the room between them! She would have fled from it, but he stood by the door. `What answer am I to have, pretty one!' `Sir, am I to be insulted thus! Let me leave the room!' `Not till I have an answer, Ellen!' `Oh, that we had gone into the street, rather than trusted you, false and unprincipled man, using the sacred veil of charity to cover the most infamous intentions!' `Nay you go not by me!' he said, arresting her as she would have passed him. `Come, you had better consent! This house shall then be yours, and as much money and as many fine dresses as you want. I will—' `Insult me no further, sir!' `You look more beautiful than ever!' And he approached her and would have thrown his arm about her if she had not retreated. He followed her. Her eyes fell on his cane which stood by the table, and she caught it up. In the quick act it flew apart, leaving a long slender sword in her grasp.— Her eye lighted up with confidence and triumph! `Approach me a step further, sir, and it shall be at your peril! Though I am but a yonng girl I can use this weapon, Heaven has given me, in my defence! At this moment Mrs. Hart returned. She was overcome with astonishment and alarm at seeing Ellen's attitude. `Mother, I have been insulted! This villain has dared to make to me, in your absence, a proposition which to think of kindles my cheek with shame! He has acknowledged that his charities were extended to you with the view of having them remunerated in your daughter's person!' Mrs Hart stood petrified. The feelings of the mother and the spirit of the woman came to her assistance! She wanted no words from Creech to corroborate this scarcely credible statement. The attitude of both were enough. His was bold and impudent, as if he resolved to brass it out. `Sir, leave my house!' said Mrs. Hart trembling with indignation. `Madam, I am in my own house!' answered Creech very positively. `Ellen, come my child! she cried in a heartbroken voice. Ellen dropped the swordcane from her hand and cast herself, weeping passionately, into her mother's arms. `Let us go? God is in the street!' said Mrs Hart choking with her feelings. `Madam, you are in my power! You go not from hence till you pay me my rent!' cried Creech furious with disappointment; for he had not anticipated defeat. He had reckoned on an easy conquest; because his victim was utterly destitute and dependant. His was one of those mean spirits that regard poverty and degradation as synonymous! God help us! if the rich are the only upright ones on earth' Mrs. Hart as she spoke became as pale as death! She saw that she and hers were indeed in his power! Her eyes became dim, her brain reeled and she gasped for air. `Ellen, support me! I am broken now— broken in pieces! Ellen I am falling! I am blind! Oh, God! is this death I feel! If it is, have mercy on my little ones! Mercy on my lambs, Heavenly Father!' `Mother! mother! oh, my mother!' shrieked Ellen as the Forger's widow sank insensible upon the floor at her feet. `Mother, speak! It is Ellen! Oh, speak,—oh hear the voice of your child—of your Ellen!' But in vain the voice and touching cries of the distracted maiden! Her mother lay still and colorless as the marble. `Monster! demon! you have slain my mother!' she cried, rising and looking round.— But the Junior Partner fearful and conscience stricken, had fled. Let us draw a veil over this painful scene. That night the spirit of the Forger's widow was released from its frail tenement, and, we trust, borne on angel's wings to a happier world, `where the wicked cease from troubling and the weary are at rest.' Creech came not near the house. The body was buried at the expense of the city, and some charitable person passing by and seeing Ellen and the two children about to follow on foot the lonely hearse, called a carriage for them. After the funeral the carriage returned with them to their dwelling, and then drove away. Ellen placed her hand on the knob to open it with the intention of getting her brother's and sister's things, and then quitting it forever. She found it locked! On looking up she saw a placard affixed with these words: `To Let— `Apply at Creech's, No. —Hanover street.' Ellen's heart sunk within her. Nothing could so forcibly have impressed her with the feeling that she had now no home, as this brief notice of the placard. `Come, children, let us go!' she said in a faint voice. `Where, sister?' asked Grace, who it will be remembered was a lovely little girl of nine, Tommy being an intelligent boy of eleven. `Where!' came like an echo from the very depths of her heart. `Sister, we are very wretched now,' said Tommy, his eyes red with weeping for his mother. `Why don,t good Mr. Creech come and see us! He has not been here since the night mother died?' Creech, however, was watching them at that very moment from the closed curtains of a hack which was stopped a little ways up the street! He had not yet given up all hopes of Ellen's submission! He had expended too much money to resign her lightly; and especially now that she was an orphan. He smiled within his black heart as he thought she would yet be in his power. Modestly attired in a calico, wearing a plain straw bonnet and green veil, and taking a hand of each, Ellen walked slowly up the street. She felt lonely and deserted, yet she did not lose confidence in an overruling Providence. As she turned away from the locked door she said fervently—`Heavenly Father, thou hast promised to be with all thy children in their in-goings and out-goings; and never to leave nor forsake them! This promise I now put my firm trust in; for my hope and confidence are in thee! My foot-steps now wander forth without aim; but I know that Thou art before me though I see thee not.' What strength comes to the soul from prayer! It is the nourishment of confidence! `A word to God is a word from God! This Ellen at once felt forcibly She was calm and cheerfully, save that grief for her mother's loss was heavy at her heart. But she had no fears for herself or the two who trusted in her. She took the way down the street. It was nearly dark, and she wished to find shelter for them before night. Care for them caused her to forget herself. They walked down that street and then up another. It was a street of handsome dwellings—the abodes of the rich, and she turned from it to a humbler one!— She knew charity was most active among the poor, who have known suffering. It grew dark rapidly. The lamplighter hurried past them with his blazing torch, rapidly kindling the lanterns one after another Poor Ellen's heart sunk within her, yet she lifted her soul in faith to the invisible Guardian and Protector of all. A poor black woman stood by a gate near a wretched tenement She looked earnestly at the three. `Lor bress us all! if I don't think dat be yung Tommy Hart!' Tommy looked round and so did Ellen and they recognized an old black woman who used to be cook at their father's. Ellen shook hands with her, and her heart swelled that even this poor woman knew them and spoke kindly.' `I declar, dis is a circumstans,' said the woman; `I so glad to see you! How you be growd Miss Grace; and you is quite a lady Miss Ellen. I hear your marm died. I am sorry for you, dear ones! Whar you lib? I hant heer nothin' `bout you dis long time, sins Dr. Elmore dead.' `I am sorry I cannot tell you good, Jane,' said Ellen sadly. `My mother owed rent, and we have been denied admission into the house since the funeral.' `And whar yon goin' now?' asked the kind old black woman in a tone of sympathy, putting her apron to her eyes. `I really cannot tell you, Jane! I am going where God opens a door for us!' `Then God hab open dat door for you and it stan' open,' said the Cook, pointing to the open door of her one story cabin. `Come, you must come in! I got two beds, and you, and Tommy, and Grace shall hab one, and I and Nancy 'll hab de oder. I got someting to make you nice supper, and now come in, and don't break poor Jane's heart by saying no!' Ellen could not reply. Emotion suffocated her! Tears filled her eyes. She canght Jane's hand, pressed it gratefully and followed her into the low tenement. Though a wretchedly poor place, it wore an air of neatness and comfort. A cheerful fire was causing a tea kettle smartly to sizzle over the coals, and a white counterpane to one bed and a neatly patched quilt to the other (for both beds were in the same room! and there was but one room to Jane's abode), gave it a homelike air. For three weeks the orphans made their home with the kind Jane. Ellen assisted her to cook and wash and iron, for such was now her means of living, though Jane would not at first consent to it. Ellen was far from entertaining any feelings of superiority, but cheerful and resigned, she with a beautiful humility becoming her condition, contributed her labor to the common maintenance. The fourth day a ter her abode there she had received a note from Creech. Knowing the hand, she erased her own name upon the superscription and returned it unopened.— Tommy tried to get work by crying the daily papers; but as he was evidently superior to the boys, they conspired against him and drove him from every stand he occupied. He remained at home, carrying water and going after and returning with clothes for Jane. At the end of the third week Jane fell sick, with the rheumatism, and fever set in so that she had to take to her bed! Ellen did all her washing for her, ironed and sent home the clothes, and there were several dozen of them: and at the same time cooked and took all the care of poor Jane; rubbing her limbs and nursing her with angelic devotion and tenderness. But Jane's fever increased, and after a week's suffering the good woman died, and went to the reward awaiting those who have done deeds of charity and mercy, whatever be the hue of their skin. The story of Ellen and the two orphans was known to nearly all the neighborhood, which was one of Africans, the friends and acquaintances of Jane. After the funeral some of these persons stopped to see her, and to condole with her. Ellen's grief was sincere; and she wept the loss of her friend with tears. What was she now to do! The neighbors had their own subsistence to look after, their own cares and poverty. In a day or two she was left to herself. She sent Tommy after the washing as when Jane lived, and tried to support herself and children; but Nance the daughter of Jane, who inherited her mother's little effects, got a place out to work and removed the furniture, even to the last washing tub; for Nancy had no feeling; and told Ellen that `white folks should support white folks; niggers had as much as they could do to get a livin' for demself.' A cart came and carried off everything, even to the beds. Ellen and Tommy and Grace slept in each others arms that night huddled together in a corner of the desolate and unfurnished cabin In the morning she gave them each the last piece of bread, and then began to reflect upon what she should do. Suddenly a shadow darkened the door. It was the Junior Partner. He had never suffered his intended victim to escape his espionage! Nancy had been bribed by him to act as she did! He now came like the Tempter. It was an hour of darkness, of the trial of Ellen's faith, almost of despair! But Ellen's soul was buoyed up by faith which no reverses could shake. The same sun shone, the flowers bloomed; the birds sang! God then still lived and was present. He could see and know all! He would aid her if it were for her good. Why then should she despair? `Miss Ellen, good morning! I am sorry to see you reduced to this,' he said looking round upon the bare walls and upon the earthen floor. `But you may thank your own stubborness! I offered you once, comfort and luxury. I have now come to repeat the offer! I will do all for you you can ask, for you and your brother and sister! You will have to come to it at last! Say that you consent and you shall at once change this wretched hovel for rooms more sumptuous than those you formerly occupied!' Ellen could only articulate `Begone, sir! Death is preferable to thy hatred presence!' She looked deadly pale! Her very spirit felt the wound this man's proposal inflicted upon her maiden delicacy. She shed tears. They fell upon her brother's cheek. `Sir,' said Tommy, `you are making my sister weep! She says you are a bad man! I don't know what you are saying to her, but her looks tells me she is both offended and ashamed! I am aot a man, but you shall not speak to her in this manner! You called her stubborn! I do not like you, Mr. Creech! You made my father do wickedly, and that brought this misery upon us, his children. Go from here, sir! Leave this house, sir!' Creech was astonished. He drew back, for base minds are always cowardly! Vice cannot stand before virtue even in it weakest form! Tommy's attitude was fearless and menacing. `So this whelp can bark it seems,' he said angrily. `Get out of the way, boy!' And he rudely pushed him. Tommy clenched his fist and flying in his face struck him a severe blow, so that he staggered back. The next moment he raised his cane and would have felled the spirited boy if his own hand had not been caught and himself hurled with violence to the opposite side of the hovel. He recovered himself with a deep execration and drawing the sword from his cane turned and saw a tall, elegant young man with his eyes flashing fire. `So, villian! Have you not enough,' cried the youth, at the same moment he seized the ruffian's wrist and wrested the sword from his hand, saying: `Now sir, begone! Leave this city! For I swear to you I will serve you precisely in this manner whenever and wherever I fall in with you in the streets! I will willingly pay one hundred dollars for each satisfaction. So, if you value your life leave the city forthwith! But stay! I have not yet done with you! Come here! Come hither, I say! There! Now down upon your knees and ask the pardon of this noble young person for the insulting words I have heard you utter as I stood on the outside, where I waited only that you might fill up the cup of your audacity! Down, I say! Both knees! Now ask humbly her pardon! Speak! Louder! Very well! Now get thee gone! Remember what I have told thee! if I catch you again in the streets of this city where your hated figure will offend the eyes of this young lady, I will cowhide you, and I shall carry one with me for the especial purpose. Get thee gone! If you would like to know who I am, my name is Edward Elmore, son of Dr. Elmore, and the avenger of the innocent, whom he loved and protected!' Creech, astonished, confounded, beaten, humbled, and full of rage, terror and physical pain, crawled from the hut and made his miserable way to the street. In the meanwhile Ellen had stood as if an angel had descended into the hut and avenged her! Tommy and Grace danced, cried and laughed in the same breath at Creech's chastisement and humiliation. Ellen did not at first recognise in the tall, handsome young man, his heightened color, frowning brow and flashing eye, her old acquaintance, Edward Elmore. But gradually the resemblance broke upon her, and she almost fainted for joy! He had no need to mention his name to her! As the crest-fallen Creech disappeared he turned to her, and with a tone and look of tenderness and delicate sympathy said, `Pardon my rude entrance and conduct, Miss Ellen, but I could not but the first thing pay this fellow his deserts. You have not forgotten me, I hope!' Ellen covered her face with her hands and wept she knew not why! She could hot have spoken a word if her life had depended on it. Her heart was too full, all too full of happiness and hope? He took one of her hands and removed it, and said touchingly, `Ellen, I know all your sad story! I have come here to take you away—you and those you love! I arrived three days ago from Paris, and my first inquiries were for you—the friend of my youth—whose image has been like an angel form going before me ever since I left you! I was told your mother had died, but no one knew your fate! Ah, how wretched you must have been! I sought you—I followed you up step by step, day and night, from the hour you left my father's tenement till I found you here in this miserable abode! Now come with me, dear Ellen! My carriage is at the gate! Haste to quit this horrible spot! We will talk further by and by.' Ellen spoke not; But he saw gratitude and happiness in her tearful eyes! In a few moments afterwards they were driving rapidly towards the mansion of a married friend of Edward Elmore's in Mount Vernon street, where Ellen found from the beautiful wife of his friend a sister's welcome. We now bring our tale to a close. Edward who had cherished abroad the warmest attachment for Ellen, which was unknown to him reciprocal in her own breast, had often in his letters to his father spoken of his attachment and his determination to seek her for his wife. This knowledge of his son's predelections, led Dr. Elmore, aside from his native benevolence of character, to take the interest he had done in the family; and frequent earnest letters received from Edward after he had learned of her father's fate, led him to have an especial regard for their happiness. On hearing of his father's death, Edward hastened to the United States as soon as possible. His only thought was Ellen. He found Messrs Straitpurse and Straitbrim,and having learned from them their course of proceedings he warmly and indignantly expressed his surprise and displeasure, told them plainly what he thought of them, and began his search. It was a long one. By mere accident he heard of them at Creech's rooms, and of their having been ejected. He sought Creech but was unable to fall in with him, but learned enough of his character from his neighbors as to lead him to draw very conclusive evidences of the base motives he had in view in giving protection to Mrs. Hart and Ellen, and then of rejecting them in the manner he did. From Creech's he could obtain no clue to them. He went from neighborhood to neighborhood inquiring at the corner groceries, bakeries and other places for a family of such persons as he sought. By mere accident he inquired (after twice passing it by) at a negro's groggery on the corner of the lane on which Jane's house house stood! Nancy was in the shop, and instantly answered that she knew; and when he said he would give fifty dollars to find those he sought, she instantly offered to conduct him. On the way he asked so many questions that she saw he was deeply in terested in them and that they had at last a friend. She then glibly told him all, how Ellen had first come there, and took all the credit of Jane's hospitaiity to herself. He thanked her with great warmth, and promised to reward her, if they should prove to be those he was seeking. Seeing now that he was likely to be a better friend than Creech and fearing to implicated with him, she began to excuse herself for taking away the furniture, saying she owed Creech and he seized it; and `that he wanted to get the young Ellen into his power, who said she had fled before from his persecutions.' In this manner conversing, Edward reached the yard and passed on before Nancy, as he wished to observe their true condition. He thus overheard the scene we have described. Thus had a Providence shown itself in the final event, at the very darkest hour! And thus Providence sees often to wait, that we may first do all we can, and that faith may be tried. The sudden change from utter destitution to comfort, luxury, friends and affection, was too great for Ellen immediately to realise! The presence of the happy Edward, however, assured her of her happiness; and in the society of one who had long had her heart and whom in all her deepest afflictions she had never ceased tenderly to remember, joy returned to her heart, the smile to her lip, and the bloom to her cheek. Tommy and Grace were also made as happy as they could be; and the three orphans having known the privations of misery, knew how to partake of the blessings which were now strewn around their sunny path. In a few weeks the following notice appeared in the Boston papers: `Married, yesterday morning, at Trinity Church, Summer street, by the R't Rev. Bishop Griswold, Edward Elmore. MD., son of the late Dr. Elmore, to Miss Ellen Hart. We learn that young Dr. Elmore inherits one of the largest fortunes of any young man in New England. Bright be the future career of the noble bridegroom and lovely bride!' We have nothing further to add; save to inform the reader that the sign of `Creech, No — Hanover street,' came down the day after his interview with Edward Elmore, and that Creech disappeared to parts unknown. As to Mr. Straitbrim and Mr. Straitpurse, we leave them to be settled for at the Judgment Day. No judgment we could bring them to could in any way measure their iniquities; such men prosper in this world—fattening for damnation! Thus we end our tale, leaving the kind reader to make his own moral reflections thereupon. THE END.</field>
