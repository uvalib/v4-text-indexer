      <field name="fulltext">THE ARROW OF GOLD CHAPTER I. In the narrow loop-hole of a ruined tower on the east coast of England, stood a man gazing forth upon the sea, dark and tempest lashed. His eyes were fixed upon a foreign looking barque which for an hour past had been struggling with masterly skill and seamanry on the part of those who manned her, to beat off from the iron rocks which the tower crested. It was near sunset, and the low clouds east artificial night over all, and through the gloom the three top sails of the ship shone spectrally white. The waves were high, and the wind terrific. The watcher had been for half an hour observing the movements of the stranger, not with the nervous and humane anxiety which most men would manifest in beholding fellow-men in dire peril, and possibly on the verge of imminent destruction, but the expression of his face was cold and stern. His appearance was that of one high born, with that finished severity of profile, intellectual outline of head and haughty air, that oftener is associated with the imperative character of nobles accustomed to have the will executed, than of men of lesser degree. Command and obedience, life-long exercised, stamp their distinctive seal upon the carriage of the head, the movement of the eyes, the bearing and step. This man was clearly of high rank. Yet the tower was a ruin, and its situation desolate upon a spur of the rocky coast that projected half a mile into the deep bay, and so lonely a wild was it, that the peasant people gave it the name of the “Devil's Castle.” Its origin was remote beyond the reach of tradition or record. Wild and horrifying tales were connected with its history. For many years past it had not been inhabited, and in lack of heirs had escheated to the crown, which left it to crumble to dust. Yet one tower remained in good preservation. It had been the donjon-keep of the old baronial lords. Beneath it men said were dungeons that went as far into the depths of the rock as the tower rose above the surface. In a seaward loop-hole of this donjon tower, stood this strange, stern man, gazing upon the sea and the storm, and the imperilled barque, with an expression of freezing satisfaction. He was enfolded in a large, well-worn Welsh cloak, and a low-crowned Cornish hat flapped in the wind over his eyes. “They do it bravely. But they will go down. Their skill and courage avail not. They were born to die, and their ship to have its end. What avails contest for life? Ten or seventy years longer for a man to live! What are they in the measure of the eternities past and before us? Men are but worms, and of no more value! They strive for a few years with fate, and perish! Why not perish to night those men of despair in yonder ship? why not to-night, as well as forty years hence? 'Twill be the same in the end! Ah, they have missed stays! The gale has her in the teeth! She drives landward! They may now fold their hands, say their last prayer—as well to-day, as any time—and go down to the bottom of the sea! For what is a man dead, better than a dead fish?” The expression of his cold, cynical face, denoted the total loss of human faith, hope, confidence and trustfulness. “You speak like a fool, my lord!” said a shrill voice behind him. He betrayed no surprise, nor turned his head. “I have not said there is no God, woman!” he answered, with a sneer on his dark and haughty yet handsome face. “As much. If man dead be no more than a fish dead, then there can be no God!” “What knowest thou? Leave me! Or rather stay, if thou wouldst like to see men die with drowning, calling on God, who hears never the cry!” “Thou art an infidel! Hadst thou believed, thou wouldst not now have been an outlaw, and hiding here to save thy head.” “Nay, I care not for my head; hut I would not like the king to have the sweet satisfaction of getting it. I love him not well enough to bestow voluntarily such a present on his majesty. But as for death, it were the same now or next century. Were a man's life ten thousand years, yet compared with eternity, it were but a day—a moment—a nothing—so it were the same to us, whether we have ten thousand years, a day, a moment, or not at all; for existence measured by time is annihilation embraced by eternity. So, whether we live or die, with this awful eternity stretching away around us, it is all one, for we become nothing.” “My lord,” said the intruder, who was an old woman, whose aspect was wild, and whose age was evidently very great, “you will never prosper. Life in time is given to man to make use of to live in eternity. When I saw thee a child, and heard thy infant prayers go up at thy beauteous and holy mother's knee, I little believed to see thee in manhood an atheist.” “Go, good Alice, go! Look you to the supper. Perchance some of this crew may be washed ashore and will crave food. Bestir thee, and if thou wilt discourse theology, talk with thy cat! Hark! Hearest thou that sound? They fire guns of distress! They pray to God with their lips, and call on men with the mouths of cannon! By the rood! men's ears will get the sounds sooner than they will reach heaven.” “Lord Robin, thou art wicked enough to bring the red lightnings down on this old tower and topple us all over into the seething sea below! Carest thou for naught?” “Nay, nurse good one, I will not shock thy faith. Albeit, I marvel that thou hast any Christianity in thy soul, since they say thou art a witch and hast compacts and covenants with Sathanas! They do say thou hast bought a thousand years o' life, over and above, and for this guerdon sold him thy soul. But I heed not these slanders, thou knowest,” added Lord Robin, with a slight smile passing over his cold visage. “I like thee, because thou wert my nurse in childhood; and I thank thee after thou wert grown old, and hadst got such reputation for dealings with evil spirits, thou hast given me shelter in this old dungeon, whither the hatred of thy race hath driven thee. But watch the ship. Hear how bellow their guns! and the blue smoke jets out and appears for an instant and then vanishes into thin air like the prayers of the poor wretches on board.” “If it were possible to serve them, my Lord Robin,” said the old nurse, with an anxious gaze upon the vessel which was now driying towards the cliff! “If there were but a boat and strong men to go in it!” “And what avail! Let them die to-day and they will not not live and sin to-morrow,” answered the nobleman. “And die they will, for nothing can save them! Go!” His attention was now fixed upon the barque. The mariners, finding that it was in vain to try longer to weather the lee shore, seemed to be seeking out a place to drive upon where the shape of the shore offered the best chances for escape. The commander could be seen at the helm steering firmly towards a beach at the foot of the excavated steps that anciently led from the castle to the sea side. Lord Robin, from his elevation, could look down upon her decks as a bird flying over would see them. There were a score of men visible who were stationed at ropes; and astern was a group composed of two ladies, a lad and one old gentleman, whose white locks blew wildly in the gale. They were clinging together as one family, the females kneeling as though in prayer. The nobleman thought he discovered an infant folded to the bosom of one of them. “Poor souls! poor babes!” cried the old woman, wringing her hands with emotion as she peered over his shoulder out of the loop-hole, and looked down on the stormy whirl of waters, through which the vessel was driving with fatal speed. The helmsman, aided by two men, in vain tried to cast the barque upon the sand-spit. The current swirling past the cliff head, drew her broadside with greater force than the wind drove her forward, and she was blown like a feather towards the cliff, the water at the base of which was two hundred fathoms deep. The helmsman, with a gesture of despair, quitted his post, and for a moment, all was confusion and running to and fro, quick casting of casks and planks overboard to swim with, while the shrieks and cries of the more terrified rose above the roar of the storm. Lord Robin watched with a fixed mouth and cold eye, yet not without interest, the consummation of the tragedy beneath him. The barque struck head on against the cliff side, rebounded, and her masts went by the board. Another dash against the rock broke her in two amidships, and down went the after part with half a score of living souls, whose wails were their only requiem. The forecastle, crowded with seamen, remained above the waves only a few moments longer, when, with a plunge, the huge fragment went perpendicularly down. The face of the noble changed not. The old woman uttered a cry of horror and hid her face. “Look, my Lord Robin! Does any one swim?” “Swim, woman? When lead swims, then men will swim in such a cauldron as this! Dead all! And why not? Men are born for this very thing—to die! Matters it not, therefore, when or how, in fire or in water! Beshrew us! they will rest as quiet in the deep sea as in the graveyard! Prayers nor guns saved them!” “Lord Robin, you make me, wicked as I am, shudder! I know that the prayers of men will pierce heaven, through its walls be made of iron, and its floors of brass. He that made the ear, shall he not hear?” “Then why died these, if Heaven heard?” “Because Heaven is wiser than we are. It were best they should perish, or they would have been heard in their strong cries to God for help.” “You are a fatalist, old Alice; you call me a deist; let both pass!” answered the noble, with a slight laugh. “What seest thou down there, that thou creenest thy scraggy neck so, and strainest thy rheumy eyes?” “A mortal being battling with the waves!” “A plank or a spar tossed by the billows?” “Nay, but a living man! I see him throw out his arms with strong beating of the waves that each moment roll over him!” “I see him! There are two! He carries on his arm a child! But they will not live five minutes!” “Can we not save them?” “Save? Have you a rope fourscore fathoms long, to cast to him, woman? Already he has sunk with his burden. Well, better death now, than to live to manhood for the child; for death would come at last. Look ye! The sea is conqueror! The blind waves o'ermaster men made in the image of God! Canst thou read me this riddle?” But the woman had left him, and he was alone. He continued to watch the sea, and the play of the forked lightnings that darted from the clouds with incessant arrows of fire, while the deep howl of the remote thunder continued ceaselessly echoing along the cliffs. At length night gathered over the deep, and at intervals, the lightning revealed in the offing a small schooner closely reefed and laying to. “There will anon be another wreck and another tragedy for man to play his part in,” he said, half aloud. “Life is only a battle for life— men are hunted by death from the moment they are born; and life is a continual flight and pursuit; but the pursuer at last is victor.” The nobleman left the loop-hole and called to the old Dame Alice; but only echoes returned his voice as it reverberated through the tower. He descended a flight of stone steps and entered a low apartment, where fitfully blazed a fire on which boiled an iron pot. There was a rude table, and a bench and keg, and a cot of dried sea-weed in the room. This was the abode of the old woman who had dwelt here after getting a reputation as a witch, partly to keep up that fame by the loneliness of her abode, and partly to secure a shelter. The nighest peasant's hut was half a league distant. Beyond that the country was wild and heath-like; but ten miles over the waste the towers of a city rose to the eye, and pleasanter fields environed it. The outlawed noble, for such he was, had a few weeks before sought this secluded tower in which she had so long dwelt alone. Here he was protected and sheltered by its very desolation, as well as by the evil reputation of Alice. The old woman had received him without a question, for in former years she had been his foster-nurse And so we find them living, hostess and guest, on the might of our story. Passing out a low door, the nobleman entered a more airy chamber which he occupied. Its furniture was rude enough, comprising only a mattress and one broken stool. There were a few Latin books, and some paper and a pen lying on the stool. A window opened from it towards the cliffs, without casement, and through it the storm blew with violence. It was a desolate and inappropriate abode for a man with the air of rank and command such as he possessed; but crime drives men to share the lair of wild beasts; for when men violate the laws of the land, they are cast forth of men to consociate like Nebuchadnezzar, with the beasts of the field. How dreadful the condition of a man who fears to meet a man! Such a wretch is isolated, and the earth is a place of punishment of almost inexpressible anguish. Lord Robin feared the sight of man. He threw himself upon his couch, and after tossing restlessly for an hour, fell asleep. As he slept, the blaze from the fire in the adjoining room flashed upon and lighted up his face. Sleep, as death will, had removed the experience of a guilty soul from the outward features, which were now calm, noble and strikingly handsome. The wicked heart within betrayed nothing on the surface. The face of the sleeping and the face of the waking man were two opposite ones. Awake, his brow was dark and bent, his eyes fierce and watchful, his lips sternly compressed; his whole form elate with the strength of powerful fancies. He slept with the severe repose of the dead. The storm passed over and the noon poured a flood of light into the gloomy chamber. The winds ceased to sweep around the tower. It was past midnight. Lord Robin had been some hours asleep when a step was heard on the tower stair, and the next moment old Alice appeared, carrying in her arms a young child. She hurried with it to the fire, all the while muttering: “Sweet angel! you shall yet come to life, and smile on me! Never was such a face of beauty! You shall be mine, little body, if you come to! You want warmth! Ho, my lord! Ho! Up and help me chafe the hands! He sleeps like a rock! Let him rest! He may refuse to let the child be brought to! I will let him alone!” Then she proceeded to rub the little girl, a fair child of four years, with a face as white as marble, and of wonderful beauty. Her golden hair was wet and hanging in rich perfume all over her shoulders. “She looks like a little angel that has fallen from the skies into the sea, and would have been drowned but for me!” said the dame, continuing to rub her and keep her feet by the fire; and from a little crevice in the chimney she drew a vial, out of which she poured a liquid with which she moistened her lips and nostrils. The lovely child soon after evinced signs of reviving, and in half an hour opened her eyes, looked around, smiled, and extending her hands, articulated “mamma,” and then sank to sleep. “She is safe! All is well! She will awake quite herself,” cried the dame, with joy. Poor babe! Her ma is in the deep sea, and she dreams of being in her arms! It was a perilous work to get her as she floated ashore on the dead man's body, who, though dead, was her safety by her clinging to him. If I had not caught her as she was driving past the rock in the eddy, she would never have breathed again. She is now mine! I will make a fairy of her. She shall learn to tell fortunes, and I will make the poor ignorant countryfolk believe she is a spirit. She will make old Alice's fortune, and when she grows up to be a young lady, I will give her all my riches for a dowry, and marry her to some lord—nay, a prince would not be too high for her! But what is here on the floor? A necklace as I live, and all of gold and precious stones! This is a prize. I must quickly hide it from Lord Robin, for he needs money! The child is of good lineage, of a surety; and her dress is of the richest cloth!” The old woman bent over the child, and for some time watched it sleeping on her knees as softly as it lay in its mother's arms. She then removed it carefully to her rough couch and lay down by its side, though first hiding the necklace in a secure place from her guest. Lord Robin could not sleep. Dreams, reaching some fearful climax would many times in the night cause him to utter a cry of distress, and to leap upright upon the floor. In one of these, he awoke not long after the old woman had fallen into deep sleep. “Is there no rest, sleeping or waking, for me?” he cried. “By day my memory tortures me, and by night I live over again the accursed past! Like an avenging spirit, the apparition of my murdered father haunts my sleep! Would God I could keep awake and ever look about me, and so let external objects draw off my thoughts from this dread within! Cold drops stand on my brow, and my frame trembles with horror!” The nobleman, in his irregular movements up and down the stone floor, passed unconsciously through the wide arch that afforded communication between the room occupied by the dame, and was there pacing to and fro, deep in his dark thoughts, when he suddenly stopped, with an exclamation! A broad stream of moonlight poured through the lofty lattice, like a silver river, and fell brightly upon the face of the sleeping child! It lighted up its golden hair, lent a radiance of supernatural glory to its fair brow, and revealed a face such as seraphs must have in heaven! Lord Robin paused and gazed as if he had seen a vision. He held his breath and remained motionless, as if he feared a step would cause it to vanish. Save the face of the child, all else was in obscurity, the bed, the muffled head of the old dame—and out of, and from the midst of the darkness, was revealed the lovely sight, such as Lord Robin thought could not appertain to earth. “If sleeping demons have been permitted to visit me, and madden me with horrors unspeakable,” he said, mentally, “waking, I behold an angel! Yet this fair sight must be human, for I see the moving lips and smile of one pleasantly dreaming; and the living heart lifts the vestment with its undulations! I will draw near and see what means this sweet vision.” He bent over the lovely child. Its rich hair was still wet. He wondered whence it had come. A slight frown contracts its forehead. A troubled look crosses the face. “Mama! dear papa! Let me not drown!” it murmurs, and turns restlessly. The careful dame even in her sleep seemed to hear and be conscious of her precious charge. For without waking, she seemed to answer: “I will save the babe! I will throw out the line as the under-tow drives the dead man this way! I have it! The line catches the body by the arm, and the noose holds close and fast. It comes shoreward. I reach it! I take off the child from his arm, and drag it from the jaws of the waves! Away darts the dead body, which has been so good and safe a ship for bearing this babe to land. Heaven shrive thy soul, brave sailor! This child, if it live, shall be taught a prayer for thee! Fear not, babe! You shall have a mother in old Alice!” Here the old woman, who had in her sleep lived over again her good deed and given it words, passed her arm over the child with unconscious instinct of preservation and tender solicitude. “I see! I need not ask whence came this fair child? Alice hath saved it from the sea. Hapless child! Surely the decree of fate that cast thee on these rocks, hath bestowed beforehand beauty on thee that would disarm misanthropy. Though my race has cast me out from its bosom, and I am at war with mankind, yet will I make exception and love thee, child! Already thy sweet face hath touched my heart, and thy loveliness appealed to my manhood.” His dark eyes rivetted upon her seemed to magnetize her; for feeling that mysterious influence which makes us conscious of being looked closely upon, even in sleep, she started, awoke, opened her large, glorious eyes, and fixed them full upon his own. “Pa, my dear papa!” she exclaimed, in a voice of love and delight; and extended her arms towards him. “An omen of good!” he murmured. “I will henceforth be to her as a father.” And stooping towards her, he kissed her and folded her with emotion to his heart. “Yes, my beautiful child, I am indeed your father.” No sooner did she hear him speak, than she uttered a sharp cry of terror, and struggled so to free herself from him, that Alice awoke. “What—ho, my lord, do you seek to kill the child?” she shrieked, springing upon him and fastening her long fingers upon his throat. “Off—wretch! Release me!” and he flung her back upon the bed, and taking the child, which was now intensely alarmed and trembling with all the sensibility of mortal fear, at finding herself in such a place and company, and environed by such violence, he attempted to soothe her. She looked from one to the other, and then flying from him, cast herself upon the breast of the old woman, and hid her face crying: “Keep me—take care of me—the dreadful man is not my pa! I know you are good, if you are old and ugly; for you speak so. Let him not take me.” “Sathanas himself may have her for me, woman,” answered the outlaw, his rage fairly aroused. “Even,” he added, “even a child reads crime on my brow, or hears guilt in my voice, and shuns me for such a thing as thou art.” As he spoke, sounds upon the water made him go to the loop-hole and look out, when he saw a schooner just laying to within a quarter of a mile of the cliff, her snowy sails shining broadly and bright in the moon, which was so brilliant as to reveal her deck dark with men, and warlike with guns. CHAPTER II. “This bodes me no good,” was the thought that passed across the mind of the outlawed noble, as he gazed from his loop-hole in the ruined tower down upon the armed schooner as she lay to, clearly visible in the bright moonlight. “Doubtless my retreat is suspected, or Dame Alice, for gain, hath betrayed my shelter; and this vessel hath been sent to take me prisoner. What other motive could it have in visiting this inhospitable iron coast and coming to off the castle? See! a boat is dropped from her quarter. Men filled! I see the gleam of arms, and even the ringing of steel comes clearly to the ear. They give way and pull towards the spit of sand! This is no place for me, if they seek me! Ho, Alice! up with thee! Here come armed men ashore, and will soon be climbing up to the tower!” The old woman was at once to her feet, the fair child clinging to her and casting glances of fear and wonder towards Lord Robin. She whispered to her: “It is papa's face—but not papa's voice! Let him not touch me!” “He shall not harm thee, child!” answered the woman, as she looked down from the window. After a moment's scrutiny, she said: “It is a king's vessel, my lord! I know her well. He who commands her is a young lord, and has a mother living not far away hence, towards the great town inland ayond the heath; and every year in his cruise he cometh to land here to visit her. Thou hast naught to fear.” “Is what thou sayest true, woman?” he demanded, with a searching glance. “Yes, Lord Robin, true and fair! Would I deceive you?” “You might,” he muttered, “if you knew my crime; albeit, you nursed me when a child!” “Whatever it be, God will judge thee, not I! It is not for a poor mortal like me to avenge and punish.” “I mistrust the boat, not thee, Alice. Thou mayest be mistaken! They are landing. I must conceal myself. What place knowest thou in thy old tower here, safer than another? But let me assure the child that I love and will protect her!” The fair little stranger drew back and cried with fear. “Go away—I am afraid. You are not my dear pa!” “And yet why will you not love me, sweet child?” “Because you look wicked! God doesn't love you, and I can't!” “Curses even of innocence follow me!” he said, with a deep oath of rage. And advancing towards her he grasped her by the arm, and tearing her from Dame Alice, cried, “I will make you love me, whether God loves me or not! Back, old woman! I am fleet of foot and strong of arm. Pursue me in my flight and you peril your life! If I am to be driven from men, I will have at least one thing to love and to be loved by. The desolation of a heart unloved and unloving, is too dreadful to bear. Release my arms!” “Never, my lord! Do you not see the child dreads you? This violence is not the way to make her love you. And you will not escape these armed men burdened by this little girl. After they are gone and you are safe, I will give you up the child, and you may teach her what you will.” “Be it so!” he answered, yielding. “Hark! I hear those men near! Secrete me, and betray me not,” he said, quickly. “This way, Lord Robin,” she replied; but her face was strangely altered in its expression. He followed her along a passage between the walls of the tower and a row of half ruined apartments. Descending a flight of steps, she came to a stone door which led into a deep excavation made in the rock on which the tower stood. “Enter here, my lord. The door is so shaped that when shut it is invisible, and to the hand and eye there seems to be only the face of the cliff.” “How long wilt thou keep me here, woman?” he asked, hesitating to enter, yet acting with decision as he heard voices above. “Until they are gone.” “Get them soon off, for this dungeon is dump and dark as a grave. But so I am safe—I am content to occupy it a few hours. Have them soon away.” “Trust my wits, my lord.” “Let me have the child—they may steal it from thee!” “No, no, I will not go in!” cried the child, firmly. “Nay, I will see that they do nothing of that kind,” she answered, after a moment's startled thought. “Farewell, my lord, till I can assure thee of thy safety.” Thus saying she swung the door heavily to, and forced in the stone bolt, which so fitted as to be undistinguishable from the door, which was cut into the irregular shape of the varying grain of the rock, so that it was rather a fragment artificially cut out of the rock than a shapely door. “What cowards guilt makes of men! Once he had a lion's courage—and now he flies and hides under ground like a mole, at the sight of men he never saw! And because all men are his foes, he would make this sweet child love him—and yet would win her love with a tiger's fawning. Fairy,” she added, as she led the trembling child along lightly up the dark passage with a torch of pine, “sweet fairy, you must not tremble. I am your friend! I will make you so happy. He shall not come near you.” “I can't be happy. I must see my ma! I can't be happy with you. Where is my dear ma? Where is the ship? This is not the ship. I saw pa in the water. Where is he and my ma?” “You shall soon see them,” she said soothingly. “Here come men. Don't be afraid of them.” But before she could prevent it, the little girl darted away from her and hid in the darkness. She was going to pursue her, when two men, one an officer in the British naval uniform, came close upon her. She was instantly seized and commanded not to give any alarm. “Your name is Dame Elsy?” said the officer, who while speaking, was joined by four more men, with pistols in their hands, and one or two dark lanterns. “Alice, not Elsy,” she answered. “And Alice or Elsy, what do you want with a lone poor dame, who has no other home left on earth than this old tower, shared with the owls and bats?” “And with a companion beside,” significantly said the officer, who was a man of thirty, brown with years of sea-exposure, and stern in voice and eye with years of command over men. There was, however, a frank, nautical air about him, singularly prepossessing. “What other than a poor woman like me would live here, captain?” she answered evasively. “Not of choice. Where is the man whom you have sheltered for some weeks?” “Man?” “Be open and truth-telling, or it will go hard with thee!” said the officer, sternly. “Whom do you look for?” “Your former master, Lord Robert Clan William! We know he is here, or has been here, waiting to escape by sea.” “Yes—he was here, but—he's escaped for safety. When he saw you coming ashore, he fled!” “Knowest thou whither? Speak out, woman, if thou wouldst thyself escape.” “He is my master!” she said with hesitation, and looking with fear upon the drawn swords and eager faces about her. “Quickly—say whither he went—or your own life will pay the forfeit for harboring a murderer!” “Whom hath Lord Robin slain?” “His father, with poison!” “His father?” she repeated with horror. “No less a crime! Besides, treason against the state hath been discovered since he fled.” “Slain his father! I believed he died in his bed a natural death, a year ago!” “So all men believed. But it is come out now that he was poisoned, and the disentombed body hath borne its own witness, which hearing of, caused the parricide to seek safety in flight, and desert all the honors, the name, and title, and wealth, to enter upon the possession of which, before his time, tempted him to the great crime of a father's murder; and now I have told thee so much, for thou seemest to be a woman of sense and intelligence, above thy wretched lot here, I will add, that his papers left behind, unfolded a treasonable correspondence with France, in prospect of the threatened invasion. Wicked and powerful, he was secretly the state's arch enemy, and used the wealth he had got by bringing about his father's cruel death, to forward his views. Such a man should receive no shelter from his kind. Reveal at once where he has concealed himself; for information is clear that he is in the tower; for our spies on land have watched closely all avenues, days before we reached here; and have seen him, and we know he is still here. But what lovely child is this?” the officer exclaimed, as the little girl, gathering confidence as she listened, in the speaker, and prompted by instinct, suddenly ran forward from her hiding-place, and caught him by the hand! With thrilling tones of voice, she cried: “Sir, good, dear officer, take me away from this dreadful place and wicked people! The woman is little good—but I don't want to stay with her. Don't you know my ma? I have been drowned and they are drowned, or I should see them! I never was away from my pa and ma before! I know you are good, and will not hurt me!” The officer pressed her soft hands with which she clasped his, bent down and kissed her, and said, gently: “You are safe with me! I will take you home. Woman, how came you by this lovely child?” “I took her dripping from the sea, last night! She was the only soul saved from the wreck of the barque.” “You did well! (so the vessel did go ashore in the storm, as we feared,” he added, turning to his lieutenant). “You must give up this child to me, and tell me at once where this Lord Robert is?” “Never will I give up the child. She is mine!” cried the woman, and springing towards the little girl as she was held by the officer, released her with sudden violence, and darted with her along the dark passages of the tower, and was out of sight before pursuit could fairly begin, so unexpected was the bold act. “Give chase, my men!” called out the officer. “Take some of you one way and some of you the other, while you, lieutenant, will go outside and intercept her. I will take the way she has gone!” The shrieks of the child, which sounded as if she was endeavoring to suppress them by force, were a sure guide, and Dame Alice was soon overtaken as she was ascending a broken stairway towards the top of the tower. Upon seeing the captain close upon her, she bounded upward, and reached the open floor of the tower which was now roofless. The next moment she was standing upon the projecting stone cap of a buttress. Below, two hundred feet of wall and cliff in sheer descent, rolled the surges with the roar of thunder against the rock. “Advance one step, sir captain, and I cast the child into the sea whence I took it! No power shall rob me of my right! If I may not keep her for my old years to love, no one shall have her.” The officer stood transfixed with indecision. That she would fulfil her word her resolute looks clearly convinced him. He was about to parley with her, when the child made a spring towards him; the sudden movement caused her to lose her balance, to recover which, she instinctively released her hold upon it. The child fell upon the very edge of the tower with its face and hands inward, and its feet hanging over the frightful gulf. The officer quickly caught her by one hand, as she was balancing between life and death, and drew her in upon the tower floor, but with such rescuing violence that she fell senseless from fright and pain at his feet. At the same instant the woman, unable to recover herself, madly beat the air with her bony hands. But in vain her superhuman efforts. With an expression of indescribable despair upon her face, she suddenly shrieked with an appalling cry, and losing her footing, reeled and pitched headlong out of sight. The officer echoed her shriek with a voice of horror; and bending over, saw her descending, turning over and over in her progress, until she struck the sea and disappeared in its depth. “Rather thyself, old dame, than this fair child, whom thou wouldst have cast over to this dreadful death! Thou wilt rest sound enough a-neath the wave till Gabriel's trump. And now, my sweet little angel, I trust thou art not seriously hurt by my flinging thee so rudely down as I caught thy hand; but it was my only chance for thee!” And he laid down the torch which he had held until now, to raise her up. At this crisis he was rejoined by his lieutenant, and hastening with their lovely burden down to the court, where there was a well of water, they speedily revived her with its refreshing coldness. When she came to, she looked fearfully around, and then said: “O, let her not have me! She will kill me, and drown me in the sea!” “No—do not fear, my sweet child,” he said, tenderly. “She is dead, herself, in the sea! You shall soon be safe with a kind mother, and with everybody who will love you and pet you, and make you forget your sorrow and tears.” “O, shall I? O, take me to dear mother! I haven't seen her since she was in the big ship in the naughty storm!” “Go at once to the hamlet inn, Antonio,” said the officer, “and order three horses for me! Have them here at once. 'Tis but three miles.” This order was addressed to his servant, a young Spanish lad of eighteen (whose life's story in itself was full of romance enough for a tale, if we had time to tell it), who, answering, “Si, senor,” quickly disappeared on his errand. The officer now laid his cloak folded upon a stone bench, and placing the little girl upon it with tenderness, soothed her with promises of soon being at home. In a little time she fell asleep, with her head upon his arm. “Was ever created thing so lovely?” he said, half aloud, as he gazed upon her. “An orphan child of the sea! Of good lineage and noble is she, if beauty and perfection of hand and foot are signs of blood. But I must not idle here. Now that that old witch's tongue is silent, we cannot learn from her this outlawed noble's hid ing-place. Let us search the tower thoroughly, Perey,” he said to his young lieutenant; “and as it is now daybreak, we shall have light to aid us.” A search was now instituted of the closest character. More than once those who sought the noble passed the wall wherein he was concealed. He heard their voices, and gathered enough to know that they were, indeed, as his fears foretold, looking for him. He thanked old Alice in his heart for the secure place in which she had so carefully hidden him, and feeling secure, he laid down on the hard rock to try to get some rest, trusting that when he awaked, his pursuers would have left the tower. Suddenly a shriek far above him in the air, startled him! Then a dark body passed like a descending rock by a little window in the cliff. He was unable what to make of it. But it was the falling body of the woman! Again he slept. When he next awaked, they had departed. It was high noon, and they had been gone two hours—Captain Manners, satisfied that the nobleman had escaped him by leaving the tower at the outset, on seeing him land. Lord Robin could see that it was day by a light that came through the breathing hole, or small window, in the rock, that looked towards the sea. It was not large enough to put his head out of, yet sufficiently so to afford him light and air, and a prospect of the ocean; and even, by putting his face close to it, he could discern the topmasts of the armed schooner laying-to under the cliff. “Their vessel is not yet gone! Perhaps Alice waits till they sail fairly off before she comes to let me out! So I am discovered at last! They know my hiding-place? Could the woman have betrayed it for their gold! But it may not be, since she hides me from them! I will wait with patience! Better be here a time than in a king's prison, or on the scaffold, with a block of wood for my pillow! When I get out again, I will take the first ship I can reach for the wilds of America! There, they tell me, men question not men! All are free to come and go; and the laws of the old world have not arms long enough to reach their fugitives. Here I have been like a lion caged—there I will be like the lion free in his retired forests! Ho! Alice! Nay, I must not call too loud! My foes may yet be near. But I hunger, and am perishing for water! I will try and rest again—and in sleep forget I am here!” But he could not repose. He walked up and down his cavern, beneath the foundations of the tower, and ever and anon paused and listened at the door! He would then try it, and endeavor to open it, but it moved no more than the rock out of which it was cut. He then looked out of his little crevice upon the sea. The vessel was sailing easily along under main, foresail and jib, the breeze light, evidently waiting for her boat's crew and officers. By this he was assured that they must be searching for him in the vicinity of the tower. So hours passed on. He grew impatient, and then anxious. He was instantly passing between the little window in the rock and the door of rock. The blood red rays of the setting sun fell slanting into his hiding-place. The sea was crimson with its beams. To his great joy, he saw the schooner come out from under the cliff, with her boats all aboard, and with her canvass set alow and aloft, steer seaward. This sight caused him to forget his day of torture and anxiety. As the schooner receded, his heart grew lighter, and he breathed freer. “They are full a league away now, and are leaving, giving up the search. It has been a hard day's purchase this pleasing sight. Now I shall soon be released! Already the shades of evening veil her from my sight, and the stars begin to sparkle above the waves. Ho! Alice— dame—good dame, Alice!” he shouted, as he approached and shook at the door. “Come and open!” He listened, and shouted again: “Woman! nurse! Alice! I am hungry, and thirsting for water! Haste and open! The vessel is two leagues away—and where dost thou loiter?” He listened, but heard no sound save that of the dashing of the waves, as it was borne upward to his ear from the base of the cliff. It grew darker in the cavern each moment, and he finally shouted, at the full top of his deep voice, sharpened by anger and half-awakened suspicion: “Hag of a woman! Ho, hillo! Why do you not come and open this door, and let me forth? Shall I be left to die?” “Die!” answered a distant echo from the vault's galleries. He paused, amazed! It seemed the voice of a mocking demon. Fear and suspicion had already begun to be formed in his mind—mere shadows, at first, flitting across his thoughts. At length, he put them into the shape of words, as he paced fiercely to and fro, at intervals stopping to utter a loud shout. “What if she has been carried off, and is now a captive in the vessel I saw so gladly leaving the coast! If so, I rejoice at my own destruction, for only she knows where I am—only she can open my door! Yet, wherefore should they take her? They seek only me! Perhaps— perhaps”—he gasped, “she has been slain, for I heard a fierce cry and sound of distress, and her voice! Perhaps, she has only fled, and will return soon! I will try and think so! I will not dwell on the worst side of the dread alternatives! I will wait. I will be composed. I will be content to pass this night here, and in the morning, she will be here! Come to my aid, patience! Strengthen me, manhood and courage! Away, cowardly fears and apprehensions and timid suspicions. I will let the morning bring all to pass. So! it is hard resting, on hunger for a couch, and thirst for a coverlid; but it is better than the king's prison. Better the ills I have than those I might have!” Thus soliloquizing, he concentrated the energy of a spirit of no ordinary strength of character, and with a calm, though rigid aspect, stood leaning by the hole in the rock, and gazed quietly out upon the stars. There was a slight breeze which poured in at the crevice and cooled his feverish brow. The wind at the same time blew outward, from a rough spur of the external rock, a shred, like a streaming pennon, which flapped between him and the evening sky. It attracted his attention, and he at length extended his arm, and, disengaging it from the sharp needle of the rock, drew it in. “What is this? A fragment of cloth, and intermingled with hair—human hair! How can this have come here! No human being could have passed out of this small crevice and left it clinging to the rock! Doubtless some wretch has fallen, or leaped, from the tower above, and their clothes have caught in the descent, and shreds have been left here. Well, they are at peace! The only good of this life is that it has death at the end!” He cast the long hair and fragment on the floor, and soon forgot it! though at intervals he would wonder if the dark body he had seen falling in the morning, like lightning, past his loop-hole, had not been a human body. All night, he walked the cavern. The secrets of his meditations, who may reveal! Who knoweth the things of the spirit of man but the spirit of man within him? A life-time may be reviewed in a wakeful night! Thoughts go swifter than pens, and thoughts write out volumes on the memory with immeasurable rapidity. The acts of a long life, good and evil, the thoughts can volume in a few hours. When wicked men are wakeful, they read themselves! They are their own book. Read—read—read they must! They may shut their eyes, but the eyes of the soul close never, and read on and read ever, whether the outward man will or no! This terrible, ceaseless reading of the life is what makes a night of wakefulness so dreadful to bad men! So, Lord Robin passed the long night with the blazing eyes of his soul perusing the acts of his life, to which the ever open ears of his conscience were vainly tried to be closed. At length, day came. The sun rose, and the gloom of his cavern was dispelled. Hunger and thirst now made him frantic. He shouted for dame Alice. With his dagger twisted into the close joint, he tried to open the stone door, but broke the steel at the first trial. He began to utter execrations upon the woman, and to charge her with wilful desertion, when his eyes fell on the piece of dress. He took it up from the floor, and instantly recognized it as a part of the gown she had worn; and the long gray and black hair, which he saw was torn up by the roots from the head, he knew was hers. For a few moments, he remained stupefied with the fearful discovery. The certainty that the body which had fallen down the cliff was that of dame Alice was now clearly apparent to his appalled soul. “She has perished! They have cast her over the wall, and my fate is sealed! I am buried alive!” This was spoken with a hollow voice, and a face as pale as the marble that effigies the dead of earth. His hand shook, that grasped the lock of hair, and his whole frame was agitated. “I see it! My doom is sealed! The woman is no more! The secret of my shelter was known to her alone. What said she, as she left me! That the secret of the door was so done, that no eye, no hand could detect, but only those who knew it! The woman is murdered by them—perhaps for refusing to betray me, and I am left to perish—entombed alive!” He at length, with an aspect of despair scarcely lighted by a ray of hope, surveyed, with a ghastly look, his prison! He walked carefully around it. He examined every irregularity. He inspected the door, and tried to shake it. He threw himself across the room, like a battering ram, against it. He then examined the window. It was scarcely larger than to receive his arm, and the rock was two feet in thickness. “I must die!” he said, after an hour's restless and frenzied examination of the strength of his hiding-place. “My voice can never be heard, save by the mocking billows. Must I die? Must I perish here day by day? feel death eating at my heart and drying my brain? Nay! I will meet it! I have my dagger left. It shall be my friend, to end my torture ere it begins.” CHAPTER III. Ten years have passed since the scenes in the foregoing chapter transpired, and we once more return to the tower upon the cliff, but not with the same characters. The evening sun glances its arrows of gold and crimson along the rippling sea, and is reflected richly from the wooded cliffs and rocks, tinging them with a ruby glow. Far and wide expands the ocean, its line unbroken by isle or sail, until it meets the rosy horizon. A boat lay moored in the little cove by the sand-bar, at the foot of the steep path leading from the tower to the sea-side, at the place where Dame Alice had so bravely rescued, ten years before, this very night, the lovely little girl wrecked with the barque. The boat is that of a fisherman, and over its side hang nets, a-drying; its brown sail is furled to the low, black mast. It contains no one; but ascending the steep steps of the cliff-side is a youth and an old man, who have just landed from her. They soon reach the top, the latter laden with shining fish, while the other carries across his shoulder a dipnet, through the interstices of which shone, with divers bright tints, a number of beautiful sea-shells, of all sizes. “It is a steep climb, lad,” said the old man, setting down his strings of fish, as he reached the top; “I once had limb and wind to mount it, and not mind it no more than a hare! But I be getting old a-now! I am well on to sixty-seven, and that is pretty close on the threescore an' ten!” “I will take the fish for you, father! you go and lay down under the old tower wall till I get back,” said the youth, with affection, while a noble look of benevolence lighted up his handsome, though sun-burned, face. “Nay, Philip, my son! I am not yet good for nothing!” said the old man, stoutly. “You have enough weight with your shells, and the quality ladies will rather buy them than my fish. When I was a lad, ne'er a penny could a man have got for a sea-shell; but now it is a better trade than fishing. I will rest me here a bit, and then will trudge for the houses o' the gentry.” “Father,” said the lad, gazing upon the tower, “while you are resting, I will go and look over this old place; for I never yet had time to see more than the outside.” “Nay, boy, thou art best outside o' it,” answered the fisherman, in a grave tone. “The place has an evil name, and I have reason to know it is no place for an honest Christian to set foot in.” “Is it haunted, father?” asked the youth with interest, and lively curiosity evidently awakened. “I have heard the cry and wail of ghosts or devils, no one knoweth which; and I do not want to hear such sounds again.” “Where was it, father? I recollect that last year, when we came down here from the hamlet where we live, you said that robbers were haunting here.” “Yes, robbers and ghosts, and Sathan, it may be. It is a bad old place, and I ne'er heard good come o't. Once it was dwelt in, some dozen years or so ago, by an arrant witch, Dame Alice; and one night, in a storm, the devil flew off with her from the tower top and dropped her, shrieking awful, in the sea! Some say she believed that she could fly, and so jumped off, in her folly, and was drowned at the bottom of the cliff. Her ghost haunts the place ever since! Sometimes she is seen dancing a top o' yon rock, and sometimes skipping about o' moonlit nights on the sea below!” “Hast seen her, father?” “Many a time! But I always gave her a wide berth; for I could hear her scream long before she was in sight.” “Perhaps it was a curlew, father?” “It sounds a very deal like one, boy; but a witch can imitate any sound. But this is not the worst. There has been heard most awful cries coming out from under the tower. They seemed to be in the very bowels of the rock. One might, it may be ten years ago, this very month, or thereabout, I was catching mackerel off the tower. There had been a great storm, two nights before, and a ship was wrecked, and not a soul saved, and by that token I remember the night well. Jacob, my brother, and I were in the boat. All at once the stillness was broke by a terrible cry that seemed to come from the mid-air. We were well frightened, and Jacob's line slipped through his fingers into the sea, and I lost the best hook I owned, and a line sixty fathoms long.” “But the cry, father? What was it?” “It sounded like some fiend shut up in the bowels of the cliff. It was a most dreadful sound as ever human ears heard. It seemed to cry for help—and then it would roar and yell like a wild beast. We were so near the cliff that we pulled out, as fast as we could use our oars, and came to our comrades in two other boats, who also were frightened at the noise; and though most of us believed it to be one of the evil ones said to haunt the tower, two of the boldest proposed landing, to see if it might not be some human being in great distress. So their courage gave us courage, and we landed, and armed with our boat hooks and fish knives, seven of us in all, we got up to the tower.” “You were very bold, father!” “We were very scared, boy, and a hare crossing our path, would have made us run away back again. When we got near the tower, just about where you see that larch tree, we were all startled by the cries again; for we had not heard them since we landed. They now seemed to come from below and out in the air. The bravest men drew close to the cliff edge and said the sounds were not from the tower, but were from the middle air—and that it was not from an earthly being. We trembled, but still listened, till we were assured that they were not in the air, but far below. This discovery not a little amazed us, and as they grew more and more horrible, we did not long delay in returning to our boats. When we got to them, we could hear the shriek above us! By-and-by they ceased, and we pulled off, and for my part, I have never fished there again by night.” “I think I would not have feared, father,” answered the youthful Philip. “Youth is ignorant, and ignorance is rash, boy! But see! what brave cavalcade have we here?” The youth turned his head, and saw galloping forward, towards the tower, a party of four or five gay riders, evidently an excursion from some one of the country-seats of the noblemen or gentry within the vicinity. “They are Lord and Lady Monteagle, lad! Doff thy cap, when they pass!” said the old man, setting him the example of deference “to one's betters” by uncovering his rough, white head, while yet they were a hundred yards off. But the lad did not hear. His eyes were fixed upon an apparition of loveliness such as only visit the dreams (if even these) of the lowly born. It was a fair, child like maiden of fourteen or fifteen, not older, dressed in a green hunting jacket, with gold buttons, a broad brimmed straw hat, hanging by the ribbon around her neck upon her shoulders, over which waved and flashed in the sun rays, as she cantered rapidly along, a cloud of golden brown hair. Her charming and expressive face was full of animation, and richly roseate with the excitement of motion. She was laughing merrily, and her voice was an alembic, in which all sweet sounds were fused, to make a voice that was melody, even though mocking-birds sang 2 around in rivalry of its cadences. This voice caused to vibrate a chord of emotion untouched before in the heart of the young shell-gatherer! while he gazed upon her face, as she flew past, on a fleet, snowy white pony, with the air of one fascinated! “You have made a conquest there, fair Agnes,” said laughingly a young man who rode by her rein, as he pointed with the silver whistle of his riding whip at Philip, who, with his bag of shells across his shoulder, stood with his dark eyes rivetted in homage upon her. The young girl looked towards the fisher's son, and seeing his handsome face, his dark locks uncovered and finely waving about his open and noble brow, his piercing eye, she heeded not his coarse garb nor his bag of shells, but blushing at his ardent looks, which met fully her eyes, she looked more beautiful than before, and turning to the young man, said gaily: “How handsome he is! It is indeed a rare conquest!” She looked back again, and seeing Philip still following her with bright eyes and a crimsoned cheek, she dropped her eyes. “Upon my word,” answered her companion, “he has made one also!” “Made what, Radnor?” she asked, archly. “A conquest also,” was the reply, with a slight motion of the frowning muscles, and a scarcely perceptible hiting, with very white teeth, of the nether lip. “Ha, old George, are you here?” said the elder of the party, reining up a large chestnut colored English horse near the fisherman, who tood cap in hand, with his son near him. “Is am glad to see you hearty. You have had luck on the water, I see! Take those fine fish up to the castle! Here is a half-sovereign—that will pay thee for thy fish and buy thee something for the good dame.” “You are very kind, my good lord,” answered the old man, gratefully. “And who is this? I have never seen him?” added the countess of Monteagle, a youthful and pretty woman, with an air and manner of great sweetness, smiling as she spoke, as if to encourage him. “My—my son—my lady! When he has been with me to the castle, your lordship and ladyship have always been up to London, or to court; he sells shells, as you see, to the neighboring gentry's ladies, and hearing your ladyship had come home, we were going to your ladyship's house with them, hoping your ladyship would find some to your liking among 'em.” While he was speaking, she was regarding the face of the youth, and so steadily, that he turned his head and looked confused, and of course, being handsome by nature, looked handsomer still. Educated and refined people do not notice the dress, but the face, expression, air, tone, bearing. The vulgar regard costume, and so judge; while to cultivated minds, costume is lost sight of in the superior claims of the “human face divine.” Lady Monteagle knew how to separate the face from the apparel. She turned to her noble husband, whose naturally proud bearing was only apparent to his peers, for to the poor and humble he always seemed humble as they, and said, in a low voice: “That face is not that of a peasant! That eye is like a prince's, and so is the native carriage of the head. It cannot be that he is indeed this old man's child!” “You are ever seeking for romance, Eleanora,” answered the earl, smiling. “Believe me, when he gets old, he will be as commonplace a fisherman as George here! Youth always is attractive!” “You are so practical, Conyers. But let us go on after Agnes and Radnor. What a graceful pair they make, for Agnes has now the height of a woman. I trust that they will take to one another, for my heart is on the union of our house with that of my cousin, Lord Cranstown. Radnor is now nearly of age, and will soon, as Lord Cranstown, be one of the most desirable matches in England.” “Wait awhile, dear wife! Agnes will be too young yet, for four years, to think of husbands, and by that time Lord Cranstown may have been taken captive by some other fair dame!” “It is not injudicious to begin in time to make moves for so important an issue as I hope to see brought about. There they are reined up on the very verge of the cliff! They are rash! Any sudden alarm would cause their horses to leap off! Agnes, child! Draw back!” cried the countess, as she came near. “We are only gazing, from this height, upon the noble expanse of sea, my dear mother. Is it not sublime! See! far in the distant a white sail is visible, like a speck of down!” “And would you like to be on board, Agnes?” said Radnor Cathcart. “O, no! I shudder at the idea of being in a vessel! The sea is beautiful as a spectacle from this safe place; but I cannot hear it roar without a secret and indefinable dread! If I ever dream of the sea, I behold it lashed with a tempest, and seem to be on board of a ship imperilled, and always wake struggling with the billows and gasping for air!” “How strange!” said the young noble. “I never dream but pleasant dreams, for you always mingle with them!” This was said with gallantry and in an under tone. The countess exchanged a glance with her husband, but evidently with relation to the words spoken by the young girl. “Come, let us alight and walk through the ruins,” said the earl. The equerry in attendance, who wore the livery of the Monteagle family, took the horses of the countess and his master, and was about to take the bridle of the pony, from which Agnes Monteagle had bounded, refusing the proffered aid of the young man, when the latter, who was also on his feet, called haughtily to Philip: “Ho, boy! come hither and hold these animals; and see you, walk my hunter about— keep him in motion, for he's warm—hark ye! do ye hear!” There was something in the manner and voice of the young nobleman that must have offended the fisher's lad, for he coldly smiled and turning from them, with his bag of shells, walked away. “What, dog of a peasant? Do you refuse?” cried Radnor Catchcart, with anger. “Obey me, and hold my horse!” “I am not thy servant—I am free to consent or refuse, as it pleases me,” was the reply of the shell-gatherer. “But I will teach thee civility to thy superiors, an it please me!” responded the youthful nobleman, red with ice; and advancing towards him with his riding-whip, would have struck him, but for the voice of the earl. “Hold thy ready hand, Radnor,” he said, in a slight tone of reproof. “Thou forgettest, so long hast thou been in India, that English peasants are not Hindostanee slaves. He is free, and will freely obey, of request, but not of command.” “See, Radnor, how I will nule him,” said Agues, with a smile. “Come hither, fair youth, and please hold my horse, while I go and see the tower!” In an instant, Philip was at her rein! In the next moment, he felt the hand of the young noble upon his throat, and found himself flying ten feet from him. He did not fall! Quickly recovering himself, he drew his fish knife and bounded towards him, caught him by the breast, hurled him to the earth, and with his foot upon his chest, and the knife waved in the air, stood over him, the master of his life! The countess shrieked! The earl sprang forward, but before he reached the spot, the shell-gatherer had removed his foot, sheathed his short knife, and walked away with the slow, proud, self-possessed tread of a young Indian warrior. The earl's fine countenance betrayed his own view of the affair, and plainly he felt that Cathcart had been wrong, and that the fisherman had only acted with commendable spirit. “I did not look for such high blood in a cliff-side sailor's lad,” he said to the countess, who, pale at the sudden crisis just passed, was watching, with half-terrified interest, the receding Philip. “He is no son of the old fisher, my lord! Never did I witness such courage, pride, chivalry, all at once, in the best born of the realm!” “He is a base lout, and shall suffer for this infamous insult,” muttered Radnor Catchcart, as he rose to his feet. “Without doubt, such conduct in a peasant ought not to be borue,” said the earl. “These people must know their place, and what is due to rank. George, thou art to blame in bringing thy boy up with such a temper.” “Nay, my lord, but he's always gentle hitherto! This 'bout of his amazeth me! I know not what evil spirit hath broke out o' the boy. I ne'er knew the like before in him!” “Teach him not to show the like again! He has made a deadly foe, I fear, in this young lord.” This was said aside, and in an under tone: “Tell me truly, is this lad thy own child?” “What, my lord?” “Nay, answer me!” “But, my lord, he is my only stay! I am old and stricken, and he is of great help to me. When the times are hard, and the fish are scarce, he gathers shells, and makes me many a shilling for winter comfort.” “But you evade my question. Is he your son?” “My good lord, everybody will tell you he is! He bears my name—he will tell you so himself.” “George, you are not candid and open. Once more I ask you to say whether he is your child.” The old man looked troubled! He bent down his eyes, as if he were counting his fish. He looked every way but in the nobleman's face. At length he said: “My lord, I am too near the grave to lie, especially to so great a man as your lordship. If your lordship will tell me when I can see his lordship, and no one is near, I will tell the whole matter.” “To-morrow, at breakfast, be at the castle and ask for me!” “I will not fail, your lordship,” reluctantly answered the old man, as the nobleman turned away to rejoin the countess, who had overheard all that was said. “You will find I am right, Conyers,” said the countess, smiling. “The boy will prove to have been some estray, picked up, perhaps from a wreck.” “Like our dear Agnes,” answered the earl, with a smile. “Because there is one child of the sea, you think there must be a score of them.” “Mark me, Conyers, that that old man will to-morrow tell you that he is no blood relation to the youth. A plough horse and my Arabian might as well be kindred, as these two.” “I am sorry to see that Radnor's early India life has made him imperative and fiery for our colder climate. The lad ought to have held his horse, and—” “Any other would have done so, gladly, but this youth, who being, doubtless, as high born as Cathcart—” “Upon my word, Eleanora, you jump at conclusions famously.” “I am assured that only an instinctive consciousness of being an equal could have led to this shell-gatherer's haughty refusal.” “You have odd fancies. But let us join them. Agnes and he seem to be at pouts, for they walk about.” They joined the yoathful pair, who were at the tower's entrance. Cathcart was gloomy, and seemed to have some cause of dissatisfaction with the maiden, who said: “You need not be angry, Radnor. If the young shell-gatherer is handsome, and very brave, I cannot help it.” “But you can help saying so. I have no doubt you would have been amazingly pleased if he had buried that knife in my heart!” “This is rather severe on Agnes, my young friend,” said Lord Monteagle, who now came up. “But let us go about the tower, and from the top get a view of the fine sea aspect, for which we have ridden hither.” As they wandered about the ruin, Cathcart's good disposition returned; and the earl entertained them with stories and legends of the place. “Do you believe in ghosts?” asked the lovely Agnes, as he concluded a legend in which these mysterious beings played a part. “I cannot say. There are unaccountable things told of many old castles. As to the awful sounds heard about this, there seems to be no doubt.” While thus talking, they came to the end of a passage, into which opened a side avenue; but as the arched ceiling above had fallen in, there was plenty of light to disclose its whole length. “Let us follow this passage, Radnor,” said Agnes, “and see where it leads.” “Perhaps into some old dungeon,” pleasantly answered the young noble, as he followed her. The earl and countess also went after them. “Here the passage ends against the rock, and there is no going farther,” said Agnes, who was in advance. “That is odd,” remarked the earl. “The passage could not have been constructed to lead no where but against the face of this rock.” While he was speaking, Radnor exclaimed, drawing his hand quickly from the rock over which he had been passing it, to feel for a door: “I have wounded my hand! Here is the steel point of a dagger, or knife, sticking out of the rock.” All drew near; and the earl, feeling the object, perceived clearly that it was the rusted fragment of a dagger. “But how sticking out of the solid rock?” he exclaimed. “Here is a crevice above and below it, dear father,” said Agnes, whose brighter eyes had been able to detect what in the obscurity the rest did not perceive. With the aid of a pocket-knife, the earl traced and irregular crevice for several inches, and then lost it. “This must be a secret entrance into some cavern in the rock. If we had a torch, we might make some rare discovery!” “I have flint and steel with me,” answered the young man; “and with some dry sticks that we passed a while ago, I can make a bright light.” “Do so, Cathcart,” said the countess; “I am full of curiosity.” In a few minutes the young nobleman re-appeared with the light, and by its aid the crevice, or joint, was soon traced for length enough to show them that an irregularly formed block of stone concealed the entrance to some subterranean chamber. After some time and close inspection, Agnes detected the stone bolt, almost hid by mould. This discovery was hailed with joy. The earl and Radnor with their united strength, forced it back, and then pried open the door. “I shudder at what may be revealed!” cried the countess. “I will not look till I know!” and she drew back. Upon opening the heavy door, the earl, who looked first in, started back with an exclamation of horror. The countess echoed it with a shriek. Agnes trembled, and clung to the earl, who called to Radnor to thrust in the torch; for he had looked in without it, and seen only obscurely what had so deeply moved him. “Behold!—it is a human skeleton upright!” he cried. “Some wretched prisoner, left here to perish by some tyrant of the tower! Let us go in and examine.” He entered, followed by Radnor; and Agnes shrunk back with the countess. “What is it, Conyers?” asked the latter, shuddering. “There is a cavern here, made for a prison, and in it is the skeleton of a man. He seems to have perished standing by this little hole or window, looking out for air or aid! See, his long hands are clasped through it, and keep the body in its place! There is some secret history of crime written here! The last day only will reveal it.” “Here is the broken dagger,” said Radnor, stooping, to raise something from the floor. “The same that had the point,” exclaimed the earl, “for they fit.” “He has tried to pry open his prison door, and broken it in the attempt,” said Cathcart. “Poor prisoner!” said Agnes, venturing in. “How much he must have suffered!” And she timidly surveyed the suspended skeleton, as it glared white and bleach by the torchlight. “See, father,” she suddenly called out, “it has a ring upon one hand!” “I see it! It may reveal something.” The earl approached to remove the ring, which was a signet; in doing so, at his touch, the fingers, hand, bones, arms, and whole frame, fell in pieces, and the skeleton lay in fragments upon the floor, the skull rolling across the dungeon. There was a momentary consternation, which soon passed by. The earl secured the ring, and holding it to the torch, after a moment's scrutiny, gave utterance to an excited exclamation of amazement, and raising his eyes with reverence to Heaven, said solemnly: “There is divine justice and retribution still on earth!” “What, my lord?” asked the countess. “Who is he?” inquired Cathcart, eagerly. “This captive, who has so miserably perished, is none other than the renegade and parricide, Lord Robert Clan William! Though he escaped the scaffold by flight, Heaven suffered him not to live. This solves all mystery! Ten years ago, I knew he was pursued to this tower, where he was said to hide himself; but he baffled pursuit. Without doubt, in shutting himself in here to escape his foes, he unintentionally buried himself alive; for we see by his broken dagger, by his attitude at the window, how he was seeking escape. He poisoned his noble and venerable father for title, and also betrayed a trust committed to him by the crown. He fled, an outlaw, and concealing himself here, was punished by God, as we see!” The countess withdrew from the spot under emotions of horror, and the earl, after examining the dreadful place to see what more he might find, closed the stone door, and the whole party, slowly and silently, with solemn reflections, returned to the upper apartments. The sun was now low, and they were soon in saddle, but deeply impressed with what had been so strangely revealed to them. A mile from the tower they overtook the old fisherman and the young shell-gatherer. As they cantered by the foot travellers, the two stopped and raised their caps. “Good even, ladies; a fair ride,” said the old man. “A good even of fair fishing for thee,” answered the merry Agnes; “and if thou wilt come to the castle, I will buy all thy shells,” she added to the youthful Philip, who, hat in hand, stood gazing admiringly, and with the deepest awe, upon her. At this, Cathcart, who seemed to have taken a bitter dislike to the shell-gatherer, either because he was too handsome, or too independent, or too kindly spoken to by Agnes, with an ugly light in his eye, rode so close to the youth as violently to knock the net of shells from his shoulders upon the ground. The marine treasures were scattered over the road, and Radnor, with a mocking laugh of satisfaction, galloped on. Agnes, not suspecting design in the act, reined up, and said: “We will help thee gather them up!” and in a moment was on the ground, and her bridle thrown to the old man. “Agnes!” cried Cathcart, with an angry surprise. “Nay, Radnor, Agnes is always for doing kindnesses. She will soon remedy thy awkwardness.” This was said pleasantly by the earl. Agnes soon completed her task, and was re warded, not only by a few words of grateful thanks from the surprised youth, but a gift of the most beautiful shell in his possession, and which she had admired as she picked it up. She accepted it with a smile, and was soon in her saddle, and on her way homeward, followed by Cathcart, in the worst possible mood for a young man to be in who would make himself agreeable to a fair girl. It was already starry night when they reached Castle Monteagle, and trotted through the ancient gateway. Two hours afterwards, the fisherman and his son appeared, and, for the night, took up their abode in a peasant's house, outside of the walls, ready to enter early to dispose of their fishes and shells. CHAPTER IV. Early the morning following the events related in the last chapter, the old fisherman brought his merchandize to the gate outside of which he and Philip the shell-gatherer had lodged the preceding night. It was not yet sunrise, though the pencilled rays of morning shot across the east like an open fan. “You are full early, Uncle George,” said the drowsy porter, opening the lattice. “Give me thy fish, and here, take thy silver pay! You fishermen are too early risers for gentlemen on land.” The fisher handed his basket in at the window, and having counted the money, said: “Master Simon, the good earl bade me come and see him in the castle, for he hath some questions he would put to me touching certain matters.” “What can my master have to ask such a low monger as thou art? Get thee gone, and let me sleep till the sun be up. Dost thou think lords rise at thy hours? a noble's sunrise is when he is over a peasant man's head, at high noon.” “Nay, but—” “No buts. Get thee gone; and if thou hast ought to say to my lord, come six hours hence.” “Sir porter,” exclaimed the voice of the earl, who was visible upon the wall over the gate, where he had been walking to breathe the morn ing air; “thou art going beyond thy place. Unbar, and let the old man enter; and see that thou be civiler to plain folk when they come to my gate, or I will speedily give thy office to another.” Upon hearing the voice and these words of reproof from his master, the fat keeper of the gate colored, and with apologies replete with confusion, he undid the gate, and admitted old George and his son; the latter of whom had been too much occupied in surveying the towers, bastions, high wall and turrets of the castle, to heed what was passing at the gate. Upon entering the court, old George, by the command of the earl, was conducted by a servitor to his own rooms. Philip remained behind, and was suffered to roam about the castle-yard at his pleasure. The earl, walking around the wall, met the old fisherman at the head of the stairs by the door of his private room. “My rogue there would have thee think, George, that we are late risers here; but I do more work before sunrise than after, among my books. Come in! Sit down. Now I will hear from thee what thou hast to say touching this lad, Philip, I think you called him?” “Philip, your lordship,” answered old George, with hesitation; “but, my lord, if I tell you the truth, I trust your lordship will remember that I have raised him, and that now he is repaying me for my care; and that it would go hard with an old man to have him taken away from him; besides, no one can have a better right to him than I, who took him out of the jaws of death!” “Then he is not your son?” said the earl, looking at the fisherman, who sat, hat in hand, on a stool by the door, rubbing down his gray locks. “No, not exactly, my lord; but I have adopted him.” “Be frank—you shall not be a loser, whatever be the narrative you have to give.” “Then, my lord,” answered George, brightening up, and with a more cheerful manner, “you shall hear how I came by him. It is thirteen years this next shad season, I was out in my skiff fishing. It was a hard year, and the schools kept far out a' sea. There had been a three days' storm, and I was anxious to get the first advantage, for fish always are caught easiest after a gale o' wind. It might have been about three o'clock in the afternoon, and having got my boat full, I hoisted sail to run in landward home, I was at least twelve miles a' sea. After running about a mile, I saw some large object floating on the water, at least half a league to the south of my course. The man who was with me, said it was a wreck dismasted, for there was no rock there. I thought the same, and steered for it.” “And it proved to be a wreck?” said the earl, interrupting the details. “Yes, my lord, not a stump standing; and the sea rolling her about like a log. It had been a very large ship, and had many guns overturned on her decks. But not a soul could we see. So—” “And you boarded her?” said the earl. “Yes, and found in her cabin seven dead bodies, which had been drowned there, for the cabin was full of water to within a foot of the deck. We were looking about to see what we could find, when we discovered in a berth over the companion-way a little boy, five or six years old, asleep. We waked him, and took him up and put him into our boat.” “And this Philip—is he the same child?” “Yes, your lordship. No one ever appeared for him, and I raised him as mine. The ship sunk in an hour after we took him off.” “The name of the ship? Do you know it?” asked the earl, eagerly. “No, your lordship. It was sunk too low for me to read it; and she was settling so fast we hastened out of her.” “I see—but got you nothing from the ship at all, by which she might be guessed at?” “A silver cup, your lordship, and a compass, and some canvass.” “Where is the cup?” “At my cabin, your lordship's earl,” answered the old man—“that and the compass.” “How was the boy clad?” “Scarcely at all—but was wrapped in a shawl.” “Have you the shawl?” “Yes, my lord.” “Bring the cup, compass and shawl to the castle, the next time you come, good George,” said the earl. “This youth may have a mother and father living, and it is right every means should be used to discover them! You shall not be a loser if they are found and he is restored to them. Come on Saturday with fish, and bring these articles.” “Your lordship's wish is a command,” answered the old man, bowing low, and hobbling out of the earl's library. “Well, Eleanora,” said the earl, at the breakfast-table, “you are not so far out of the way, after all! This handsome shell gatherer is not old George's son. He picked him up at sea some fourteen years ago, from off a wreck, and adopted him!” “I was well convinced there could be no blood lineage!” said the countess. “How odd it would be, if he should turn out to be of high rank.” “That denouement occurs only in novels, dear wife,” said the earl, smiling. “How singular that there should be two such instances! Look, my lord! There both are! Both taken from the sea—orphans alike! See, Agnes is merrily bargaining with him on the terrace for his shells.” It was a fair sight to which she directed her lord's eyes. Upon the upper step of the broad terrace, Philip sat, with his shells all arranged in harmony of shape and colors. As Agnes went by to the breakfast-room, attracted by the display, she lingered and began to select the fairest from among them. He seemed perfectly happy at her presence, and with constant blushing heard her praises of their beauty, and replied to her questions as to their names. “And what is this superb one, all pink and orange, with pearl intermingled, and curved like a lotus?” “That is a sea-fairy's shell,” he answered. “Hold it to your ear, and you will hear the roar of the sea.” “Indeed, I do, plainly enough,” she cried, with delight. “Where do you find all these?” she asked, fixing her beautifully lingering eyes upon his face, as if wondering at his beauty; but if he rested his full gaze upon hers, she would drop their eyelids at the same instant, while the conscious blood would mantle their temples. Neither, in truth, could look at or speak to the other without embarrassment—a confusion of the senses, pleasing as it was bewildering. Fortunately, Radnor Cathcart was not at the castle to see this, or his ireful jealousy would have been roused to some purpose. Suddenly their eyes met, over a gorgeous shell as she was asking its name, and such was the effect of his upon her, that she said, hastily: “I must not stay here—I will buy them all! Take this gold piece.” And putting it into his hand, she laughed she knew not why, and ran away and seated herself at the table as roseate as a caruation pink. “You and the fisher-lad seem to have made quite an acquaintance, Agnes;” said the earl, with a smile. “I hardly said ten words, dear father—” “But looked ten-score! If Radnor could get from you such glances as you showered upon Philip, he would feel himself happy.” “Why, my dear father!” “Agnes is young, Conyers, you should not make her blush so!” said the countess. “The blush was on her face when she came in. It was the shell-gatherer put it there!” “Impossible!” exclaimed the countess, quickly. “What did he say to you, Agnes?” “Nothing, mother—he only—only—” “Only what—speak!” “Only looked, that is all! But then his eyes are so handsome and piercing.” At this the earl laughed aloud, and the countess slightly frowned, as she said: “Agnes, you must not notice the eyes of young men, especially of those you know nothing of.” “I wont, my dear mother!” answered the maiden, demurely. “Agnes has handsome enough eyes of her own,” answered the earl, “without thinking of other folks. How many shells did you buy?” “All he had, dear father?” “Marry come up! But he brings his wares to a good market!” Did you bid him bring more?” asked the smiling nobleman. “As many as he pleased; but I would like to ride to the same sea-beach, dear papa, and gather for myself. He says that there are more beautiful ones there!” “We will ride there some day,” said the earl. “But when is your archery party coming off?” “Soon! On the first of May, dear father.” “And the prize arrow is to be of gold?” “Yes, papa! Radnor has ordered it from London.” “Radnor is very kind and thoughtful,” said the countess. “I hope you will show him, Agnes, you appreciate his thought for your happiness.” “I would like Radnor, if he would not tease and annoy me so,” answered the maiden. “He watches my words and looks, and wont let me smile at anything only when he speaks. He would be a blue-beard to me, I believe, if he had me in his castle.” “Don't talk in this manner, Agnes,” said the countess; “he thinks so much of you, that—” “That he wont let any one else look at her,” said the earl, laughing. “Well, I dare say it was just so when I was young, fair wife! I was a miser of your looks and glances, and could have crossed lances with any other young man who caught one of them.” While they were talking, a gentleman entered, whose arrival was hailed with transports of welcome. The earl shook him heartily by both hands. The countess kissed him and called him “brother,” while Agnes was folded in his arms. It was Captain Manners. Ten years had made but little more alteration in his appearance than to turn his whiskers gray, and give him more fullness in person. “When did you leave London, Manners?” said the earl. “Three mornings ago. I have come to say good-by, before sailing for the Mediterranean; and have three days to spare.” “Four days, and you will be at our archery party, uncle,” cried Agnes, who sat by him holding him by the hand. “Archery! You have arrows enough in your eyes, girl, to pierce the best target a man ever placed in front of his heart.” “It is my birthday, uncle; I shall be fifteen, and—” “Your birthday— Why, Conyers, sister! How did you find out, wh—” A glance from the countess stopped the naval officer, while the earl said: “The first of May, you know is her—” “O, yes, that is right, I understand,” answered the captain, with an intelligent return of the earl's look. “How the sweet thing has grown. Why she is as tall as the queen, and that is tall enough for any loyal English girl, hey, Agnes? By the bow of Dan Cupid! If I were a score of years junior, I would be sure to fall in love with your eyes, girl!” “You couldn't fall in love with a niece, you know, uncle?” said Agnes, naively. “Niece! ah—yes—I—I forget! True, it would not answer,” answered the captain, in a blundering way. After breakfast was over, the earl and his brother-in-law were seated together in his library. “And so she is ignorant of her birth, and believes herself to be your own daughter?” said the captain, continuing a conversation. “Yes.” “And the day I brought her here on horseback from the old tower, you celebrate as her birthday?” “Yes, the first of May. On the occasion of her fifteenth birthday, we give her an archery party. Some score of the young maids and youths of the vicinity are invited, and an arrow of gold is to be the prize to be shot for.” “I will stay, and maybe I will shoot for it, too,” cried the captain. “What would I not give to know who her parents were? I have long ago given up my fruitless inquiries to learn what barque was lost that night off the tower. But I love her, as if she were my own child.” “And we share your love for her, captain! Never was so fair a daughter given to parents— fair in temper, in form, in face, in voice, in manners. Such a winning art of loving—she has a winning love.” “Were ever such superb eyes! I have seen Spanish girls and Circassian, and maids of Ind and the South Sea, but never such a pair of eyes.” “You were always running wild with beautiful eyes, brother,” said the countess, entering. “Has Conyers told you what horrible discovery we made at the old tower, yesterday?” “No, what was it? Not the ghost of that witch, who leaped from its top!” “No, but the skeleton of the outlaw and parricide, whom you sought to take captive!” “What—of Lord Clan William?” exclaimed the captain, with eager surprise. “Yes.” “He had evidently sought shelter in one of the dungeons—a secret cavern—where we found his ghostly remains! This ring which I removed from his bony finger, identifies him. He must have perished miserably.” “What a wonderful discovery!” mused the captain. “I fancy that the woman knew of his concealment, and having been killed, he was left unapproached by any human foot, and so died by slow torture.” “I think it probable. What a chapter of horror would his last days there unfold.” “Surely there is one who rules above!” ejaculated the captain, with emphasis. “What did you do with the skeleton?” “Left it there in its dungeon-tomb, and closed the door upon it as we found it.” “I would like to ride over there.” “Yes, while you are here, we will visit the place to gratify your curiosity.” Not far from the castle was the parish church buried in a group of venerable oaks. Towards this sacred spot, Captain Manners slowly took his way, during the evening of the day of his arrival at Monteagle. The doors were open, and uncovering his head, he reverently entered and took his way up the aisle towards the chancel. Ancient marble effigies of the noble dead reclined on tombs erected above the crypt. To one of these he advanced, and kneeling by it covered his face for a few moments as if in silent prayer. Upon it was inscribed the names of the earl and countess of Beverley. They were his parents. He came, with filial piety to pay his respects to their revered memories, before going into a foreign land. The latter had died since his last visit home. Ten years before, she was the dowager mistress of the castle, and it was to her he conveyed in the saddle, the child which he had rescued from the power of Dame Alice. The countess had with her at the time her daughter and husband, the Earl of Seafield, now Monteagle, who adopted the “orphan of the sea,” and took her to their own residence. On the death of the aged countess soon afterwards, the Earl of Seafield removed to Monteagle Castle, and took the title of Monteagle, to that of Seafield. Captain Manners, whose true title was now Lord Beverley, after having paid this tribute of his respect for the memory of his noble mother, arose from his knees and unconscious of the tears that stood on his sea-tanned cheek, turned to walk out of the church, when he was startled by seeing before him the form of a woman in gray, who was leaning upon her elbows with her face in her hands, and fixing upon him keen and watchful looks from her haggard eyes. The church was obscure with evening twilight, and he could only perceive indistinctly her face. “In the name of Heaven, what art thou?” he cried with a changing countenance, and stepping back as if he had seen a spirit. “Thou shouldst know me, Lord Beverley,” answered the woman, mockingly. “If I had not seen thee killed by a fall of two hundred feet into the sea!” “The sea opens its bosom to its children, and dashes them not to atoms like mother earth.” “You did not survive that descent! Is it possible?” “I am no ghost!” “It seems incredible; but since thou art alive it was possible!” said the sailor. “What do you here among these graves, as if thou wert a restless soul?” “I had last night a house among the dead! an empty tomb shelters well the living. My lord,” she suddenly added, “I demand of thee my child.” “Then thou hast not seen her?” “I look to thee for her. She is mine! Does she live?” “Yes—but—” “Then she is mine! I have travelled half the globe to get hither, to find what became of her. I last saw her in thy arms ten years ago.” “Where hast thou been?” “Over the sea. Wouldst thou know? I was driven to sea on a fragment of the barque's wreck. After being a day upon the deep, I was picked up by a ship bound to the distant shores of Brazil. Only yesterday did I reach this place, seeking my child!” “What is she to thee?” “I have had only one thought in all my absence—to get back to England to hunt up my child! I have come thus far. I believed you took her to your own home. I shall know to-night, whether she was sheltered by yon castle wall. Tell me, my lord! She is naught to you. Does the child live?” asked the woman, with almost a menacing air. Captain Manners was troubled. He felt that a serious evil had crossed the path of Agnes, in the sudden re-appearance of this woman—whose passions ten years had increased and made fiercer. He felt that it was important that she should be ignorant of the child's fate, whether it were living or dead. He resolved that she should not see her if he could prevent it. “Dame Alice, if this be thy name, this is no place for thee! Begone from this estate, or I will have thee arrested as a vagrant.” “Thou wilt, eh? No, no! I fear no such thing. I go not away, until I have seen the inside of yonder castle.” “Wilt thou take gold and begone?” “Gold. Look ye! Hark!” and she shook before his eyes a bag that she drew from her girdle, and then opening the mouth of it, showed him that it was filled with gold. “This comes from Brazil, where it grows. Think ye I was ten years in that land, and got not wealth? I have hoarded it up for my child.” “What child?” asked the captain. “The child I drew from the sea, and of which thou hast robbed me.” Lord Beverley for a few moments was undecided how to act. To let her visit the castle would be to cast a firebrand into it, and destroy the peace of mind of the earl and countess, and the happiness of Agnes, who was ignorant of her orphanage. At this moment, he saw passing on the road, one of the bailiffs with two other men, on their way to the village two miles off. He called to them; and not without a struggle was Dame Alice borne off by his command as a vagrant. He returned to the castle ill at ease in his mind, but resolving to have the old woman sent the next day out of the parish, to her own, he concluded not to speak of his having met her in the church to any one, trusting no more would ever be heard of her. The ensuing day he appeared before the justice, and making his complaint, she was banished beyond the bounds of the parish, which would place two leagues and a half between her and the castle at the least. Preparations were now made with great activity for the coming trial at archery. A lawn in front of the castle, between the chief gateway and the church was enclosed, and seats provided for spectators, and tents made ready to be pitched on the coming morning. Booths for refreshments for the peasantry, and Maypoles and ground for sport of ball, were prepared for them beyond the lists for the archers. Some of the noble guests commenced arriving the evening before; youths and maidens followed by retainers bearing bows, arrows and targets. All was cheerfulness and confusion, hurrying to and fro, and getting ready for the momentous morrow. Captain Manners, in his excitement, quite forgot his interview with old Alice. “You must feather that arrow nicer than that, uncle,” said Agnes; “for I intend to win the golden arrow with that one!” “I had best feather it with humming-bird wings,” said the sailor, laughing. “No, with the eagle's feathers!” “Are these eagle's plumes?” “Yes, and they are very hard to get! Radnor said it was impossible to shoot an eagle.” “How then came you by these?” “Why, when I said yesterday that I would give anything if I could only beard my arrows with eagle's feathers, for they are the truest, the young shell-gathered said he would capture me an eagle!” “A brave promise?” “And he redeemed it. This morning he brought to me a live young eagle, and it is now a captive on the other side of the courtyard; and these are some of the kingly bird's plumage.” “This shell gatherer must be a man of courage,” said the captain. “He is only a youth—scarcely nineteen!” “Handsome as well as brave, I dare say?” said the captain, with a mischievous twinkle in his hazel eyes. “Very!” “Fine teeth?” “Perfect.” “Raven hair?” “Like the very raven's plumes.” “Tall and well-shaped?” “Princely.” “A real hero, hey? in canvass jacket and bare feet!” “Now you are laughing at me, dear uncle.” “At your earnestness and romance. It is well this youth is a poor peasant, or Radnor Cathcart would fare badly, I am of opinion.” “I don't think Radnor near so handsome!” “No?” “Nor so—so kind-looking!” “Ah, indeed!” “Nor so—he hasn't such fine eyes!” “I see how it is; Radnor has a formidable rival. I must warn him,” said the captain, trying to look grave. “He knows it already, and hates Philip, and quarrels with me!” Here the captain laughed heartily, and nearly spoiled the arrow; while Agnes laughed and blushed, and finally ran from the apartment. CHAPTER V. The morning of the fete of May dawned with cloudless skies. Ere the sun was fairly arisen, scores of youths and maidens were in saddle for two leagues or more around Castle Monteagle, and coursing in high spirits towards the scene of the day's festivities. The archery ground was a spectacle of the greatest activity and excitement. A level lawn, just outside of the castle wall, had been temporarily enclosed by a slight wicket fence. Here and there in the area grew a venerable oak, sufficient to shelter the archers, but without presenting any obstacle to the sports in contemplation. At the southern extremity of this park-lawn was pitched a markee of large size, from the summit of which fluttered and flashed in the morning sunbeams the red cross banner of England and the gorgeously emblazoned bannerets of the noble Monteagles. From the lattice of her room the fair girl, whose “birthday” was to be honored by all this rich display, gazed down upon the lawn with its busy groups. She was already arrayed in her archer's costume of green velvet and crimson cap with a superb sable plume. Her graceful and youthful figure was finely displayed by this costume. She leaned upon a long and richly-ornamented bow with a silken string, and with one hand was tracing upon the window-sill, with a thoughtful and absent manner, erratic outlines of involved figures with the point of an arrow of gold. Evidently her mind was not with her hand, though her eyes followed mechanically the movements of the point of the arrow. She was observed by Radnor Cathcart. Attired as Robin Hood, and looking like a prince of the forest realms, he had thrown himself from his horse a few moments before at the gate, and, ascending the terrace, had designedly walked around the square tower, which he well knew would lead him past the windows of the room occupied by Agnes, and which opened upon the terrace. He beheld her thus engaged, and drew near her unperceived, and watched her countenance through a lattice of ivy that partly veiled the window. If she had been thinking of him, there would have been a secret sympathy, a certain instinct, that would have told him so. But there was no such consciousness in his soul. The fair face on which he looked was indeed a mirror, but it did not reflect, as he gazed upon it, his own image. He felt the disappointment a man would feel, who looks into a glass, as he supposes it to be, and sees only his rival on the other side. In a word, Radnor, predisposed to jealousy, did not like the aspect of Agnes's countenance though a more lovely one wooer never need wish to gaze upon. Her pensive eyes, soft and dreamy and bright as the gazelle's, though the hue of the maiden's was borrowed from the southern skies, followed musingly the point of the arrow; and once a rich suffusion from the heart mantled her cheeks and made her look more beautiful than ever; yet Cathcart liked her looks less than ever. He was satisfied, quite so, that it was the thought of somebody else besides himself that had brought up that conscious emotion. Still her beautiful eyes followed the point of the golden arrow. His also did so, but he could see nothing, for she consciously wrote nothing; and though gold write on stone, it leaves no more impression than words written on the air with the finger's end. But words shaped in the air with a finger may be read by a quick eye. Radnor's jealousy made his eyes very sharp; for jealousy is a great quickener of all the passions and emotions. Doubtless he would not acknowledge that he was jealous! “Of whom?” he might interrogate the interrogator. There was no other Agnes knew; and everybody understood they were by-and-by to be married. Of course, if the young shell-gatherer were named, the young nobleman would fling back a scronful denial, and regard the intimation as an insult! A young fisher's son make a lord jealous? If he had him at his whip's end, he would lash him as he would his hound. Yes, and lash him for jealousy's sake. In a word, the young noble hated Philip in his heart; but he would not have deigned to hate one so lowly, if he had not been touched with a pang of jealousy. Not that he believed for a moment that Agnes would favor a peasant with a thought, or that the peasant would dare to look up to her with a shadow of hope; yet he was plainly jealous of the youthful shell-gatherer. His eyes followed the motion of the golden arrow as it seemed to trace out some shape or other on the stone sill, and he hoped to read the invisible words by the motion of the point; but it only formed circles and curves in and curves out, now a triangle and then a wreath. This wreath seemed to please her, and she let it shape itself into a crown, leaf and stem, beautifully interwoven with the golden stylus, all invisibly. Yet he could, by the movement of the point, see the very form of the leaves, which were laurels. When she had ended it she paused, and seemed to regard it in her mind's speculation as if it were visibly before her eyes; then, with a smile and a sweeter blush, she commenced writing with the point within this invisible immortel. With an eager gaze Radnor followed its motions. He saw her write a large letter, which at first he thought would terminate with being an R, and his heart bounded pleasingly; but, after a slight pause at the first loop, she there ended the letter, and left it a capital P. Then followed a small “h,” then an “i,” to be succeeded by an “I” and another “i;” and a small “p” concluded this airy name written within the airy wreath. There was no doubting. His eyes had followed the invisible tracery of the visible hand as plainly as if it had left behind letters of fire. “Philip!” he gasped. “This peasant is in all her thoughts! If he crosses my path, I will crush him beneath my feet as I would a worm.” “So, fair maiden,” he suddenly exclaimed, advancing into view, “you seem to be fancy free this morning, and amusing yourself with your thoughts. I trust they were agreeable.” This was spoken with temper and a slight manner of derision which he did not take the trouble to conceal. Young as she was, she was high-spirited, and felt his tone to be insulting to her; and she answered, with a slight curve of her upper lip: “Extremely so, Radnor!” “Then you were not thinking of me!” he said, moodily. “You must consider yourself a very disagreeable person, then, cousin!” He frowned, and retaliated, “I know well you were not thinking of me; for I have been a-disagreeable subject, I doubt not, since —” “Since when, cousin?” she asked, quietly. “Since you saw the fine eyes of that impertinent fisher fixed upon you, and he flattered you by giving you shells.” “He has very fine eyes. I am glad you had the taste to admire them, Radnor.” “You are provoking, Agnes!” “Then you should be more gentle, especially on this my birthday.” “Answer me one question!” “If it be civil, cousin.” “Who was in your thoughts as I came up?” She colored like a peony, and, after a moment's embarrassment, answered: “O, a good many things.” “I can tell you of one subject.” “Name it!” “The shell boy! Your thoughts were all upon him!” he said, with an evil look of mischievous triumph. “Well, may I not think of whom I will? Are you not thinking of him now? What more harm if he cross my thoughts than yours, cousin?” “But you did more. You wrote his name within a wreath!” “Wrote his name?” she repeated, with looks of amazement, first at him and then of close scrutiny of the window sill. But it told to her eyes no tale of betrayal. Again she fixed her wondering gaze upon his face, on which was an expression of intense triumph. “Radnor, what do you mean? You saw me write no name, for none was written!” And yet she knew she had made the motion of writing the outlines on the stone's surface; but, not dreaming that she had by these motions been betrayed, she began to fear that he had the power to read her thoughts. She became pale, and regarded him fixedly with a look of fear. But fear was not a new emotion in his presence. There was an imperative haughtiness and insolence in his character that often made her feel afraid of him; while he possessed, in his better hours, better attributes, that made her easily forget his more disagreeable manner. “How could he know my thoughts?” she mentally asked, and saying, hurriedly: “You must excuse me, Radnor. My young friends are spurring towards the gate, and I must go down and receive them.” “First,” he cried, detaining her by the hand rudely, “tell me if you love not this peasant?” “Cousin Radnor, your question is an insult!” “So it is; and so it would be, if I were to ask you if you loved my hound because he licked your hand. I will only look upon your notice of this fellow as I would regard a look of kindness cast from your superb eyes upon my dog! So, pardon the insult, fair cousin!” There was a bright flash of indignant light in the eyes of the young girl, but she suppressed the answering speech that sprung to her lips, and, saying she must receive her guests, fled from him as he endeavored, in order to say something more, to detain her by the golden arrow. She left it in his hand, and disappeared. “This girl has no longer a heart, soul and mind all for me! I loved her because no one had ever loved her, nor she a thought of other. In all her freshness and innocence I bowed down to her, and believed myself the only worshipper of one who, young as she is, has all the power and genius of a woman's nobler feelings —innocence—nature without guile. I could have taught her to love me—fear me—bend to my will as if I were God to her! But this fisher's boy, gifted with a form and face that make him look beneath his coarse garb like a disguised prince—this fellow, on whom nature, in a freak, has lavished all the outward gifts of birth—he has made an impression upon her imagination. The thought of him has entered her heart. It has corrapted her single-minded regard for me! To write his name with unconscious expression in motion of what she was meditating upon! This betokens evil to my love's selfishness. On her upon whom I fix my passion neither king nor peasant must gaze admiringly! And this arrow revealed her thought!” added the young noble, as he regarded the elegant shaft which was to be the victor's prize that day. “The thing is blasted in my sight!” And, with a gesture of anger, he cast it upon the floor of the terrace, and, stepping upon it, ground it with his heel as he walked away. At nine o'clock the whole company had arrived in the castle, and were regaled by a sumptuous breakfast in the great hall. At ten o'clock the trumpets sounded from the archery ground, as the signal to prepare for the chief sport of the day. The country people gathered outside the lists in a dense crowd; while within the barrier was an amphitheatre of seats, where sat the lord and lady of the castle, with more than a hundred nobles and gentry with their ladies. Between this terrace and the superb markee stood the archers, forty-four in number, youths and maidens; the former dressed like foresters, but in silk and gold and velvet, and the latter in varied and graceful costumes, in which green and crimson hues predominated. Few of the youths were over nineteen, while the maidens were from a fifteen to eighteen years of age. Seldom has a festal gathering displayed so much noble and high-born beauty in promise. Peerless among her peers was Agnes, “sole daughter of the house,” whose loveliness drew expressions of admiration from all eyes; for, though more beautiful than all her companions, such was her sweetness of temper, unconscious of superiority, and her gentle deference to and preference for others, that she was not only popular but beloved. Opposite this group of competitors, about fifty yards across the green, stood the target, which was painted with five circles, each of a different color. The centre of the circle was a gilt disc, the size of a crown-piece. The gold arrow, which Agnes had returned for, and found upon the terrace, unaccountably marred, was suspended above the target by blue and scarlet ribbons. Over the target two great oaks flung out their arching limbs, and formed a grand roof above, like the groined ceiling of a cathedral. At length the herald sounded again, and the sports began. Many a good hit was made, and many a bad one, and laughter and applause alternated. The young girls proved to be the best shots, but, after an hour's trial, not an arrow had touched the centre of the crown-piece, though three times it had been struck. One of these arrows belonged to Agnes. Among the spectators outside the barrier was old George, the fisherman, and near him stood Philip, the shell-gatherer. His looks followed only the movements of the daughter of the castle, his eyes traced the path of only the arrows from her bow. If any one had watched his fine face, they would not have failed to perceive that his heart was in the success of Agnes; and if the watcher knew much of the human heart, he would have detected under the outward interest the timidity of a love that was in the first trembling of its new and strange emotions. At length there was a recess for a banquet in the tent. During this interval of two hours, as they were walking about the grounds, after the feast, waiting for the herald's trumpet to sound for them to resume the sports, old George, seeing Agnes near the barrier, talking with a young man who was feathering an arrow for her, drew near, in a humble way, and said, deferentially: “Ah, my young lady, no arrows like them feathered with eagle's wing! I hope you were pleased with my boy's gift.” “Yes, George,” answered the maiden, kindly: “but it takes an eagle to make the feathers fly straight to the mark.” “You do not make allowance for wind, lady; and all your strings are made of silk, when they should be of good deer's hide; silk gives, and don't let the arrow go off with a spring, as it ought to.” “Why, George, what do you know about archery?” asked Agnes, with a pleasant laugh. “It would seem you ought to know only about hooks and fish-lines, instead of talking so wisely about bows and bow-strings.” “In my younger days, lady, I could use the bow, and have shot many a bird with arrows headed with sharp steel. It was when I was in the Hebrides, and lived as much by egging in the high cliffs as fishing in the deep seas a-neath. We often had to kill the birds to get the eggs, and also for their down, with which great ladies in them days trimmed their winter coats. We had to use bows and arrows, not only because guns and powder was dear, but the noise of shooting would scare off the birds; and when they got to understand how that the report meant death, they wouldn't come back the next year, but go to other islands. I have killed in my day, lady, many an eider duck with my yard-long arrow, at a hundred yards.” “And we can't hit the centre of the target in fifty,” said the young man, laughing. “Come, old man, you must take a trial at the target, and win the golden arrow; for we all deserve to lose it, being such bunglers.” “I couldn't do nothing, young gentleman, with one of them toy-things,” answered George, looking with contempt on the handsome bow, ornamented with pearl, which he held in his hand. “But perhaps Philip might do something with it, as he is a better bowman than ever I was, though I taught him.” “Then Philip can use the bow,” cried Agnes. “He must certainly enter the lists,” she added, with carnestness. “If he did, lady, he would quickly carry off your golden arrow,” said the old man, proudly. “If he will only consent! Will you, Philip?” she asked, as the young shell gatherer's eyes met hers, at which collision of glances both their faces reddened, while Philip answered: “I have not so much confidence as to be confident of success; still, if you wish it, I will try; but —” and here he glanced down upon his coarse apparel. “He shall have my suit,” answered the young man, “for I should like, of all things, to see the prize carried off by a fisher's boy. It is in the porter's lodge, where I left it when I resolved I would shoot arrows no more at a mark I could not hit. He shall have my bow and arrows, also.” With some persuasion on the part of Agnes, who had set her mind on Philip's entering the list, for she had secretly hoped his skill would prove superior to that of Radnor, who, moodily keeping out of the sports in the morning, had been heard to express his intention to enter the lists, and secure a prize which “no one seemed able to win,” as he sneeringly expressed it. Agnes now resolved to set off Philip against him; but aware that Radnor would not contend with him, knowingly, she gladly embraced the offer of her cheerful young friend, Edward, the son of Charles Dacre, who forthwith, in his desire to gratify her whim, led Philip off to the porter's lodge; having first, however, pledged secrecy about the whole matter to the fair girl. About half an hour afterwards the lists were once more alive with the archers, and the spectators again were seated, as before, in the amphitheatre. At the private suggestion of Agnes, Lord Monteagle proclaimed, by the herald, that after two trials each of the competitors, without taking the prize, the lists should be open to all comers. There were many excellent shots, but none clave the centre, which was so constructed, that, when hit exactly, it opened in two leaves, like a crown-piece split, and moving in and out on hinges, and let the arrow through out of sight. Out of over four hundred shots that day, not a single arrow had disappeared, though two struck within half an inch of the charmed centre. Even Radnor's shaft failed. When at length all had made two trials, the field was proclaimed open to all comers. Upon this the eyes of Agnes might have been seen to brighten, as she looked earnestly towards the right side of the tent, where she saw standing Edward Dacre, and, near him, a young man of the noblest aspect and appearance on the field that day. At first she could not believe her eyes; but she knew it must be the handsome shell-gatherer; yet, but for that knowledge, she would never have recognized him in his present costume. The crimson cap, and sable plume tipped with green, the jacket of rich purple velvet, and vest of silk, gorgeous with gold, all exceedingly set off one of the finest figures and most handsome faces ever maiden gazed with admiration upon. If she had almost lost her heart (which she had never lost to Radnor) to the shell-gatherer, there was danger of its irrecoverable loss now. “Who accepts the invitation to all?” asked Lord Monteagle. “Are there none of my fine forester lads who want a golden arrow to kill venison withal?” There was a laugh in the crowd, but no one moved to come forward, for the presence of the great awed the peasantry; albeit among them might have been some stalwort youths who drew as good a bow as Robin himself. “Come, Radnor,” said Lady Monteagle, “try once more your skill, as there seems to be no more competitors. We will not leave the field till the target be hit. The last best hit was your own.” “I can hardly compete without a rival,” answered Radnor. “Hither comes one who looks as if he intended to show us his skill,” said the earl, as he saw a young man, with dark, flowing locks, an eagle eye, a tread like a prince of the desert, and an air at once frank and noble. All eyes were turned upon him, as he advanced and took his place at the point whence the arrows were to be shot. “Who is he?” “Whence comes he?” “Who knows him?” was asked from one to another. No one was more perplexed than the earl, unless it was Radnor. He regarded him with a look of open admiration, but, though Agnes closely watched his countenance, without the least suspicion. Indeed, old George did not know him, and commented upon him, as of a stranger, to his companions about the barrier. Bowing to Agnes, who was seated upon a canopied dais, like a queen upon her throne, he strung his bow with a practised hand, and, giving it one or two trials with his whole arm's strength, he next chose his arrows with great care. There were seven in his quiver, and he had broken and cast upon the ground six before he was satisfied with the seventh. “He has seen a bow before,” said a forester, within bearing of old George. “He means to shoot but once!” “Ay, man, and he looks, young as he is, as if he knew how to use a bow. I never saw but one lad, and that's my boy Philip, who can hold a how like —” The old man was interrupted and his attention drawn by a cry of, “Hist! they are going to shoot!” Radnor took the first shot, after having, with the greatest care, tightened his bow and selected his shaft. All was suspense as the arrow hummed sharply through the air along its fifty yards of rapid flight. Every eye followed it to the target. It struck the central crown-piece, but not so exactly as to open the valve, 3 and fell, shivered in a dozen fragments, at the foot of the target. The unsuccessful archer dashed his bow upon the earth, as the shout of the people, who at first thought he had hit it fairly, changed into a note of disapprobation. The populace were tired of unsuccessful shots, and had a right to suppose that one who had put himself, as it were, on a “forlorn hope,” would carry off the prize. “Better not try, you'll fail!” said several voices, as Philip drew his arrow up to his eye. It lingered not a moment, but went off on its errand like a shaft of light. Straight to the target's centre it sped, and had no sooner touched the gilded disc than it disappeared through it. There was a simultaneous shout from peer and peasant. The air rang with applause, and when the cheers had subsided, there arose a loud hum of voices, all speaking together in praise of the shot and of the skill of the archer. Old George was eloquent in his admiration, and only wished he knew who had taught “that young lord” how to use the bow. The herald brought the golden arrow, and placed it, kneeling, in the hands of Agnes, as she sat upon her throne. He then conducted the victor to her, who, blushing and embarrassed, stood before the dais “the cynosure of all eyes.” Agnes then gracefully presented to him the golden arrow, which he received with a grace and self-possession singularly becoming, and replied to her in a few words of grateful acknowledgement. “It is Philip! I know him now!” cried the old fisherman, hearing his voice. “What, the shell-gatherer!” exclaimed Radnor, with eyes full of the light of angry surprise And fixing his gaze fully upon him, he then, as if fully satisfied of his identity, grasped him by the throat, crying: “Caitiff! To dare compete with a noble!” There was instantly a general commotion. Philip flung back his antagonist, and, in the act, dropped the gold arrow without knowing it. He then turned to leave the spot, when a sudden outcry caused him to look back. Radnor was standing, with the golden arrow fitted to the string of his bow and drawn hard to the feather. In another moment the metal shaft would have been launched through his body; but Agnes, with a scream of horror, caught Cathcart's hand, but too late to prevent a most terrible calamity; for the arrow turned aside, and the bow slipping at the same moment, the point of the arrow rapidly grazed the brows of the young girl, and pierced an oak, in which it stuck tremblingly. Agnes, with a cry of pain, fell insensible into the arms of the earl. When at length she revived, she felt around for her mother, and said, with touching plaintiveness, “All is darkness!” There seemed to be no visible wound on the eyes, though the brow above them trickled with blood; nevertheless, as it soon appeared to all, was she, in that brief, cruel, guilty moment, rendered totally blind! The light of her glorious eyes, by one act of pride and passion, was extinguished in darkness! CHAPTER VI. The scenes upon the archery ground, at castle Monteagle, which closed so painfully, and almost tragically, as narrated in the chapter preceding, had been passed full three weeks, when Radnor Cathcart, now Lord Cranstown, by the recent death of his father, rode towards the gate. He was arrayed in deep mourning, and his haughty countenance was subdued, partly, it may be, with grief at his father's decease, partly, perhaps, with shame and regret at the disgraceful part he had enacted on the day of the fete. He had, immediately on the occurrence of the calamity which had stricken the lovely Agnes with total loss of sight, after a confused and brief attempt to apologize, mounted his horse and galloped off, followed by the excerations of the people. He did not believe that she was blind, and with arrogant confidence, said, half aloud, as he dashed farther from the scene: “She will see well enough, to-morrow. It is only a temporary shock of the nerve!” Nevertheless, he was uneasy, and the following morning despatched a messenger to learn her condition. The reply was in a note by the hand of the countess: “Unhappy young man! Your uncontrollable temper has ruined Agnes forever. She is pronounced by the surgeon totally blind. Heaven and your own conscience have mercy upon you! Agnes forgives—but the earl will not hear your name.” Upon reading this, Radnor became nearly insane. He was deeply attached to Agnes, and loved her with more ardor than he ever manifested towards any earthly object. His father, being at this time rapidly declining, drew off his thoughts in some degree from Agnes; and his death, two weeks after the fete, overwhelmed him with grief. At length, having paid the last filial honors to the noble dead, he determined to present himself at the castle and solicit the pardon of the earl and countess, and in person receive the forgiveness, scarcely to be realized by hope, of the lovely girl whom he had deprived of sight. It was late in the afternoon when he drew rein near the gate, and the evening sun was casting the long shadows of the trees far across the level lawn. Between the gate and a group of oaks was a shaded rock, from beneath which gushed, cool and clear, a spring of water, which flowed across the park in a bubbling brook, and finally lost itself, six miles distant, in the sea not far from the tower. In the shade of the rock sat an old woman, with gray hair hanging loosely about her shoulders, and dressed in a sort of Spanish style. Her head was bound about, above her hard and wrinkled temples, by an orange colored shawl. Her eyes were deep-set and bright as stars, while an expression of cunning in them was in keeping with the subtlety about her mouth. Her looks were evil and misanthropic; and if she ever loved her kind, such emotions seemed now altogether extinguished in her soul. The young nobleman regarded her with surprise and curiosity. The road led by the spring, which was within a hundred yards of the castle wall. As he drew near and was riding past, on a slow walk, with his eyes fixed upon her, she rose from the spring side and advanced quickly, so as to intercept his path. His horse stopped and turned half round with alarm at so wild an apparition. “Who and what are you, and why do you stand thus in my way? Aside! or I will spur over you!” he cried, between anger and superstitions dread. “Nay, my lord, a young and new lord will not stain his fresh and noble name with maiming a poor old woman.” “You know me, but I never saw thee! Thou art a witch, at the very least, or thy looks belie thee.” “Men think old age and witchcraft in woman go together, my lord,” she said, with a sneer and laugh. “I can tell fortunes, nevertheless.” “I want not mine! Begone!” “Thine is already told! A titled lord and a blind bride!” “Out upon thy foul tongue!” he exclaimed, with a fierce cry, as he attempted to reach her with his riding whip. “Nay, my good lord! You need not foam and fret. It becomes not thy sable garments nor thy nobility. Hear me patiently! I will tell thee what, after thou art wedded to this blinded bride—” “Witch—silence!” “Peaceful, my lord! After thou art wedded and learn the secret I can now tell thee, thou wouldst give half thy gold that thou hadst listened to me now.” “Ah, what then? what hast thou to tell?” he cried, eagerly. “Thou lovest her?” she asked, or rather asserted. “Well!” “Blind?” “Woman, you will madden me! Yes, blind. I love her—for I made her so!” Here his face suddenly paled, and he seemed deeply moved. “And you go now to cast yourself at he feet, I dare say! But what wilt thou with a sightless wife. She will ever be a present reproof! You will by-and-by hate her rebuking eyes that never look out of their darkened windows. All who see her, will talk of thy deed of passion! Thou canst not take her to court— thou canst never love her! She will be a fixed column in thy hall, and thou canst never stir from her side! Thy days will be those of a captive; and by-and-by you will say, with Cain, `my punishment is greater than I can bear.' ” “Woman, what picture is this you so maliciously paint?” “The prophetic future!” “I begin to fear to make her my bride! Your words impress me.” “You believe her to be the daughter of the noble lord of this castle!” “And truly so!” he said with surprise. “Falsely so!” she answered, significantly. “What is it thou sayest?” “That the fair Agnes, now blind Agnes, is not the daughter of this noble house!” “What do you tell me? What evil speech is this?” “Ask them!” added the woman firmly. Lord Cranstown appeared impressed by her manner, and said: “Whose daughter is she, if thou sayest truly she is not their's?” “Mine!” “Thy child!” “Ay. Am I not a woman? May I not be a mother as well as the noblest countess in the land? The girl is mine!” added old Alice, with a loud and determined voice. “What you say is false!” “Go in and ask my lord and my lady!” she answered, scornfully. “And if thou liest, I will have thee hanged,” he cried, as he rode rapidly towards the gate of the castle. “And if I speak truly, wilt thou wed her and become my brave son-in-law?” “Never—though she saw with the eyes of an archangel,” was the young nobleman's haughty response. “There is one sweet act I have done for my beloved! He will cease to trouble her! for, by going down on his knees and humbling himself before the earl and countess, he might have yet won her; for who would marry a blind wife! But I have well rid her of him, with all his greatness. He would not wed her, though she saw with angel's eyes! So, good—she will yet be mine! I will have her all to myself; for the earl will not care to have her long, when he shall know all! Then, I will keep her in my own house. I will watch her, and be eyes to her. She can't see how old and ugly I am, and wont hate me! O, it will be so pleasant to be loved by some one who cannot know how unloving I look. They call me a witch—but I have not quite given up all my human nature. I love that child I took out o' the sea, and because she is blind, I love her more, because she cannot see me and hate me! No bridegroom, noble or peasant, shall take her from me! Already she loves me, and when, last night, I secretly found my way by the terrace and stood by her bed, and while her attendants were asleep, told her her whole history, how I risked my life to take her from the roaring sea, and how I was robbed of her, and how they brought her to this castle and reared her as their own child, and how I had been for years thinking only one thought, and that about her, having only one object and that to find her again, loving only one thing and that her sweet image, she shed tears out of her beautiful, but sightless eyes. She could not see how old and ugly I was, and as my voice was kind, I might have been an angel, for all she knew! There enters the young lord! He will soon learn the truth, and then I shall have only the earl and countess between me and the possession of her.” So soliloquized the old dame, as she re-seated herself by the spring and continued her occupation of washing certain medicinal plants which she had gathered in the forest. The young nobleman was ushered by a servitor into the room where the earl of Monteagle sat with a sad and troubled countenance. He had only half an hour before come from the darkened room where the countess kept almost ceaseless watch, by day, with Agnes. She had sent for them to unfold to them what had been revealed in the midnight interview which Dame Alice had had with her. When they entered, she was seated in an arm-chair by the lattice. A faint ray of light fell upon her brow, which was pale as alabaster. Above the right temple was visible a slight scar Her eyes appeared perfectly natural, and perhaps were more bright than was natural, but they were like eyes exquisitely made by art. There was in them no expression—out of them looked forth no soul. Her face was touchingly lovely, and upon her features was impressed sad and gentle submission. It was a touching spectacle. The earl's eyes filled with great tears, and sitting down by her, he took her hand in his and kissed her with deep affection. “My noble and good lord—” began Agnes. But she was interrupted quickly and with surprise: “It is I, your father, dear child!” “I know it, dear father—you are my father and you my mother indeed! but I know my story! I am not your child!” Both the noble pair started and exchanged glances of inquiry and of pain. “How did you learn this? Who hath told you the secret we would forever have sealed?” asked the countess, earnestly. “You shall know, my dear parents—my more than father and mother! Last night, I was laying awake, for a slight pain within my eyes kept me from sleeping. I told my watchers to sleep, and if I needed them, I would call. I lay between waking and sleeping, and seemed to be carried in my thoughts to a beautiful land, where I saw birds of the most beautiful plumage, such as I never saw before, and trees of the strangest, yet most glorious description, and flowers of fragrance and beauty that were unknown to me. There were fields and woodlands and a noble villa—but all unlike anything I ever saw. Even the skies were bluer and more lovely, and the soft air did not appear like the air I knew before. I was gazing upon this scene, it seemed to me, from a rosy cloud, not far above it, when an indescribably lovely being, with four wings, all of gold and blue and purple feathers, appeared suddenly before me. The face of this noble angel, as I thought it was, looked backward continually, and could not turn her face forwards. This did not appear to surprise me in the least, nor did I consider it a deformity, but on the contrary regarded her as the most wonderfully lovely creature imagination could conceive of. “She addressed me, saying: “ `Daughter of men, I am the angel of Memory! Now that thine eyes to view the present around thee are closed, I am sent to open thine eyes of the past! Behold! what thou seest beneath thee is a scene in the world of the past, from which I come. We call Time in that world Memory, the younger sister of Time, and ever following in her path.' “The angel then left me, and I contemplated with delight the lovely scene revealed below, and which I have described. It gradually seemed to me as if I had seen it before, and while I was wondering, I was recalled to myself and the present by a low voice near me. I started, and felt a soft touch upon my forehead. “`Agnes, be not alarmed! I am come to see thee, for I love thee, and dearer art thou to me than all on earth.' “`Who are you that speak?' I asked, not being able to see her. “She then proceeded to relate to me how that I had been shipwrecked when four years old, and that she had rescued me, and taken me to the tower on the cliff, when a naval captain took me by violence from her, and conveyed me here, as she has since learned; for she was carried a great way over sea, and only after years of search has found me. She said I was given her by Providence, that she has a mother's claim upon me, and that now I am blind no one will care for me, and she will take me to a home where she will spend her days in making me happy. I have sent for you to know from your own lips, my dear father, if this tale is true.” “It is,” answered the earl. “This woman must have arisen from the dead, for she was surely drowned.” “No, she was saved by a boat. You confess that I am the child she saved, do you not?” “Yes, but—” “Nay, my dear father; but if it be so, this woman has indeed a claim upon me; and—” “Not one word, dearest Agnes! You are and shall ever be to us, our child!” “Yes, you have shown the same affection to me as if I were, and I wish I could show you my gratitude. I am now blind and helpless. You can have no pleasure or hopes in me now! I have sent for you to let me go with this good woman, who saved my life, for I shall only be a constant burden and care to you—” “Agnes,” cried the countess, weeping and interrupting her, “dearest daughter of our hearts, do not agonize us by thus calmly talking of leaving us, and of being a burden to us! You are nearer and dearer to us than ever!” “But my lord is soon going to Spain, as minister from the king, and you and I were to accompany him. I, helpless, as I am, cannot go, and you, my dear mother, must not remain behind for me. I cannot mar your pleasure.” “We will make any sacrifice for you, self-sac rificing girl,” said the earl, impassionately. “I will abandon the position, and—” “No, my dear lord, no! Already I see I am a bar to your movements; since I am not of your name, consider me as a stranger. I willingly will go with the good woman who saved my life!” “This may not be,” said the earl. “Knowing you were an orphan we loved you, and this discovery, which is only one to you, does not affect us. When did this woman visit you?” “Last night; and left as secretly as she came. Do you know who my parents are, my father?” “No, my dear child.” “Nor my country?” “No. It must be England, for you spake the purest English when we received you at the hands of Captain Manners, my brother-in-law.” “The good woman who claims me must become my mother,” said Agnes, sadly, but firmly. “I cannot mar your visit to Spain. You must make no such great sacrifice for me.” Both of them embraced the lovely girl, and shed tears freely. At length the earl said: “This woman must be found! She must not trouble you again. You are our daughter, and we will not part with you.” “But by-and-by my birth may prove to be too lowly, and—” “Not wert thou as low-born as Philip the shell-gatherer,” answered the earl. “He has been here again to-day to ask after my welfare,” she said, in a tone full of grateful emotion; “and he insists on bearing all the blame. He says that if he had not presumed to enter the lists, it would never have happened! He blames only himself, and suffers as if he were indeed the real cause of my misfortune. He is so noble and feeling!” “Yes, and I feel a deep interest in him,” said the earl. “He shall always see you when he comes, for I have observed how much happiness it gives him.” “And me, also,” she answered, artlessly. The countess looked at her husband, and smiled. Soon afterwards, not wishing to weary the lovely patient, the earl retired, resolved, as well as was the countess, that she should be removed, as soon as it could be done, from beyond the influence of the “weird woman,” as he termed Dame Alice. He was found by Radnor pacing his room, and reflecting upon what had passed; for truly as she had said, her calamity would stop his journey to the court of Madrid, to be undertaken in a few days, by the king's command. He looked up at the sound of footsteps, and beheld the young lord Cranstown. He regarded him with a fixed look of displeasure, which, however, was instantly removed from his face, which assumed a cold, grave expression. “Good even, my lord. I condole with you upon your loss. Your father I well knew. Peace to his memory!” Thus speaking, the earl coldly waved his hand towards a chair. “No, my lord, I will not sit. I have been so bold as to call to inquire for lady Agnes.” “Blind, sir, blind—stone blind!” “Your lordship's tone is severe,” said Lord Cranstown, with a reddening cheek. “So is her misfortune. What would you more?” and Monteagle turned almost fiercely upon him. “To ask forgiveness, and to offer to atone—” “Atone!—atone for extinguishing the light of heaven from a human brain! Hast thou fetched with thee, my lord, new eyes, that she may see? In no other way can thy words have meaning.” “I see I am not welcome! But I hoped to show you that I felt my guilt. I came to assure your lordship that I will still take her to wife; and try by my devotion to her, to atone—” “You will marry her, eh?” “I repeat it; and since she is sightless, you will appreciate—” “O—ah—yes—I appreciate! You have taken the jewels, and would have me toss you the casket. But, pardon me, my lord. I have felt this calamity. I may, by-and-by, talk with you more favorably. But first I have a duty to perform. Agnes is not my daughter—she is a foundling!” “Then the tale I heard is true indeed!” exclaimed the young man. “What tale hast thou heard?” “That she was the child of an old peasant woman.” “Where heard you this?” “From her own lips.” “Well, we know not who is her mother! She is equally dear to us. She may have a better mother than the woman you speak of.” “Is she noble, my lord? Think you Agnes is noble?” “Made so by our love and adoration!” “I cannot marry unless it be ascertained who she is. This woman may have stolen her; yet she says she is her own offspring.” “It matters not. She is blind and helpless; and she is God's offspring, committed to our keeping.” “My lord, pardon me if I withdraw my obligation.” “What obligation?” “That I would wed her.” “My lord Cranstown, you add insults to deep injuries! Your horse waits his rider! I know you now, and beg that the acquaintance here end!” Thus speaking, the earl turned from him. The young man, pale as marble, and with livid lips, haughtily took his departure, leaped into his saddle, and spurred madly away towards the forest. “How, my lord? What news? Is it not all true?” cried the weird woman, stepping from behind a tree, as he dashed past. He gave her no other reply than a look of desperate fury, and was soon lost to sight in the depths of the wood. Without question, Radnor Cathcart loved Agnes; but his pride of birth could not stoop to one who might be ignoble. A sense of honor might have induced him to marry one whom he had deprived of sight, but no considerations would have led him to unite to his name and house an unknown girl. If we could look into his thoughts as he rides homewards, more slowly as he increases the distance between him and the castle, we should detect a secret satisfaction, an undefinable feeling of relief that he was not bound to marry Agnes! for though he had been willing to make her his wife, blind as she was, in some sort to atone, as an honorable man, for the calamity he had brought upon her, yet now that the obscurity of her origin afforded him a favorable way of escaping, he gladly embraced it; for, in his heart, even were she the daughter of the Earl and Countess of Monteagle, he felt no disposition to clog his life, upon which he was just entering, with a blind and helpless wife. Therefore, Lord Cranstown, as he rode on, became more and more calm, and by the time he reached his own home, he felt very lightly reconciled with the issue of his visit to castle Monteagle. “And this accounts for her looks of regard cast upon that low-born shell-gatherer—being low-born herself; as every bird mates with its fellows! I have made an escape; and but for this accident—yet it was her own fault, in arresting my arm to save the serf's life,—but for this lucky accident, I should, perhaps, have taken to wife the daughter of a peasant; nay, this old woman may have had the Earl of Cranstown as her son-in-law!” Thus gratulating himself, the young and subtle noble resolved to banish Agnes from his thoughts, with a feeling of resentment against himself for loving one so obscure, and against Lord Monteagle for permitting him to remain in ignorance of her history. After the departure of the young nobleman from his castle, the Earl of Monteagle, following with his eye from his window his rapid pace, had seen the weird woman appear from among the trees, and address him as he galloped past her. Instantly he left the castle by a postern on that side, and rapidly made his way to the forest. He beheld the gray figure of the old woman moving swiftly in the direction of the ancient church. He followed, and saw her disappear within the church-yard, under the shadows of the yews. He hastened forward, and came upon her as she was entering the tower, the door of which was broken from its hinges, and could not be quite closed by the old sexton. He was upon her steps, and found her just in the act of descending beneath the chancel into the crypt of tombs. The interior of the venerable church was solemnly gloomy, and at this evening hour, when the shadows of the closing day were everywhere spreading and deepening, it had an awe-awakening aspect. He paused in the aisle as he saw her disappear; and recollecting that she had once been cast into the sea for dead, he began almost to believe that it was a spirit he had followed, rather than a living being. But he was not superstitious. He was quite convinced that this person must be the woman who had secretly visited Agnes by night; and as he had seen Dame Alice years before, when she dwelt in the tower, he had been satisfied of the identity when he beheld her hail Lord Cranstown in the forest. He now moved swiftly and noiselessly, and found the door of the crypt open. But he need not have been so careful to conceal his approach. She had seen him following her from the first, and had purposely led him to the church. As he was gazing down to see where she was, she struck a light, which cast a strange glare about her, as he discovered her in the empty tomb. “Come down, my lord! This must be your home one day, and you may as well familiarize your eyes with it! Enter, my lord of Monteagle. Nay, shrink not back! It is not death that invites you, but the living. This is my home!” “Art thou the woman—the—” “I am the woman you seek.” “Wherefore do you haunt my house? What wicked notion can urge you to mar the peace of the dear child—” “Because,” she interrupted, sternly, “because the child is as dear to me as to you. She is mine, Lord Monteagle! Heaven sent her to take the place of my own fair-haired one, which died when I was a young wife. I snatched the child from the waves and became its mother. Your brother robbed me of her. I would recover her! I will take her, blind as she is, for now you care not for her. Give her to me, my lord!” “You ask in vain. Rather would I come and lay her dead in this tomb, than give her into thy hand!” answered the noble. “Dead shall she be laid in this tomb, unless thou givest her into my hand!” answered the weird woman. “Dost thou threaten her life?” “Nay. But her life is mine! Thou hast loved her and had her smiles for ten years, while I have wandered the world desolate. The past is thine—the future must be mine!” CHAPTER VII. The Earl of Monteagle slowly returned towards his castle, from the old church where he had talked with the weird woman. The interview between them lasted full half an hour; and resulted in a conviction on his part, that, though he would not surrender Agnes to her appeals, he might permit her to visit her and remain with her in her apartment, to watch over her. “This much, I feel, is due to her singular affection for her,” he said to the countess as he entered her room on his return, after having given an account of his interview with Dame Alice. “She is no witch—but a strong hearted woman who has been more abused by the superstitious hatred of ignorant people than she merits. I am satisfied that she will make a faithful nurse to the dear child; and she will need, in her helplessness, all the aid we can give her.” “But she is so old and hideous, my dear lord,” objected the countess. “Agnes is blind and cannot know it!” “True. But may she be trusted?” “Without doubt. Her affection for her is her security, dear wife! And we owe this to her; for truly she has a higher claim to her, than we ourselves have. Besides, it is imperative upon me to proceed to Madrid. I must leave London in two days. It will be impossible to leave you behind to watch over her, and as impossible to take Agnes, helpless as she is. It would be dragging her through a tour of misery.” “But with whom, besides this Dame Alice, who perseveres in calling her her child, shall we leave her?” “My brother-in-law, Manners, will return to-morrow; and is to remain on furlough, you are aware, for several months, until his new frigate is completed. He remains here!” “I had forgotten it. We can leave Agnes in his good hands, and that of the marchioness his amiable wife.” “Until our return. This is settled.” “I only object to this old dame.” “Consult Agnes. I have confidence in her, and to say truth I would gladly see her about Agnes; for I believe we should render both happy. Do not forget that if she is dear to us, we owe her to the courage of this woman.” At this moment a page entered. “I will see what Agnes says,” answered the countess; and the earl sat down to open and read some letters, brought by the page, from London, while the Countess Eleanora sought the chamber of the blind maiden. At the door her ear was arrested by low voices. She paused and recognized in one of the speakers Philip; the other was Agnes. She was seated in the window that opened upon the terrace. The moonlight revealed the young shell-gatherer standing outside and leaning in over the very spot where she had in imagination written in air his name with the point of the golden arrow. “I am alone to blame, Lady Agnes,” he said, in tones of self-reproof. “I shall never forgive myself. If I could return your sight by giving up my own life, I would not hestitate a moment to sacrifice it.” “You are not to blame at all, Philip,” she answered, very earnestly; and she extended her fair hand to feel for his, to grasp it in token of her confidence in his innocence. He was timid and would not touch it! he had not boldness enough to put his hand into her warm clasp. He felt himself but a fisher's lad, while she was a highborn maiden—invested by her birth and beauty, in his lowly view, with the superiority of a goddess. It was bold in him, it is true, to steal to her window and whisper her name as he had done; but it was from anxiety, from a desire to see her and ask her forgiveness, and to know how she was; and if there was no hope that she could see again. She appreciated his kindness, and her grateful accents thrilled through and through his soul. He felt he could have lingered there all night to listen to her musical voice, and gaze down upon that angelic face, the glorious eyes of which, in the moonlight, seemed seraphically bright. The countess now entered, when the youthful shell gatherer embarrassed would have fled. But innocent of all evil, and having been aforetime suffered by the countess to come into the castle to ask after Agnes, he checked the impulse and remained. “So, Philip, you are not content with seeing Agnes by day, but you must come by night.” “I came, lady, to tell her good-by. I am going away.” This was spoken sadly but with decision. “Wither? not out of the country, I trust,” said the countess, smiling at his manner. “I am going to London, lady!” “And why there?” “To seek my fortune. I am done with shell-gathering, since Agnes can see and admire them no more.” “But I can feel their shape and smoothness, Philip,” she said, pleasantly; “and you can tell me all about the beautiful tints.” “I am resolved to go!” “And leave your old father?” “He is not my father. He found me on a wreck at sea! This I have been told by him. He consents that I may go; for he hopes I may find my parents.” “Have you any clue?” “Only a silver cup and an iron-rimmed compass which were taken by him from the wreck.” “And how will these aid you?” “They have initial letters, and the compass the maker's name and number. I hope to learn by them what ship was wrecked, and then who were the passengers. My father, that is George, says I shall find the record in the port it sailed from, and if I can only discover what ship the compass was sold to, or what person the silver cup was sold to. It bears the maker's stamp, and was made in the Strand in London.” “These may indeed aid you; and I trust they will. But you go on a forlorn hope: yet you may find employment, and yet do well in London,” added the countess, who felt disposed to encourage the departure of one who was evidently too deeply interested in Agnes for his own or her happiness. “Good-by, Lady Agnes!” said Philip, now taking her hand. “Forgive me your blindness! “I shall not return until—” Here his emotions overcame his voice, and touching his cap to the countess he vanished in the shadow of the buttress and the next moment letting himself down by the ring on the wall by which he had ascended, he was soon rapidly moving across the moonlit lane, towards the king's highway, which wound through the ancient forest, surrounding the castle. After he had thus suddenly taken his leave, the countess approaching Agnes, took her hand and found her weeping, great drops of tears chasing one another down her cheeks. “What, my child! tears for a peasant boy!” said the countess, smiling, and gently wiping them away. “Mother, he is more than a peasant boy! He is so noble, so frank, so good, so kind!” “Yet it becomes you not to think of him again.” “Mother, I have no other occupation,now I am shut out from the beautiful world, but to think of those whose voices are kind. Philip is not the son of a fisherman. He may be well-born, as I believe he is! Yet high or lowborn, he is kind and he loves me, and I cannot but be grateful! Now that I am so helpless, I shall have few to love me; and I must cherish every heart. The blind are often dependent on the attachment and faithfulness of a little dog. Reprove not my tears, dear mother.” “I am rebuked, sweet daughter! I like Philip almost as well as you do; and so does my lord think much of him. Have you any idea how he is going to London?” “On foot, he told me.” “He must have need of gold! I will send a well-filled purse after him.” “Nay, mother, I asked him if he would take from me ten gold pieces; but he looked hurt, and declined them—proudly, too.” “He is above his seeming, evidently. George has well taught him; for I see he is well-accomplished.” “Yes. The old man has many books he picked up in chests from wrecks, and all these Philip says he has read, and that makes him talk like one of better position. I am so sorry he is gone! for he would have been so much company to me,” she said, with artlessness. “It is better he go, child! Better for both of you. Without doubt, he felt it so, and therefore departed. But I have come to ask you, my dear child, if it is your wish to have the old Dame Alice about you? She entreats to be allowed to serve you.” “Then by all means suffer her to come. It will gratify me, for I owe her my life! Have you consented to please me, my dear mother, and go with my lord to Spain?” “It is a sore question for my heart.” “But the good, noble captain and his lady will be here.” “Yes. To their care I could commit you without anxiety, if I leave you; but—” “Leave me you must! The earl will have to go, and you must accompany him for his own happiness and your own.” “I will please you, then,” answered the countess, with a smile struggling through her tears. “A thousand thanks, dearest mother!” cried Agnes, embracing her. “Now I shall bear my affliction easier, since it does not involve the happiness of those I love most. Here I shall be happy. You will often write to me, and Dame Alice, my second mother, will read your letters to me.” The next day Dame Alice came to the castle, and applied for admission to see the earl. Her whole appearance was changed. She wore her hair smooth, and a cap above it, neatly tied. Her gown was plain but neat, and her whole air was that of a respectable village matron. The change of costume had produced a corresponding improvement in her face, and she wore a look of dignified repose. Lord Monteagle did not at first recognize her. The countess, who now beheld her for the first time, was prepossessed in her favor. Willing to recognize the debt due to her, as the rescuer of Agnes, they now fully consented to give her the position near her, which she sought, and she was led to her room, and forthwith installed, greatly to her joy, in her new vocation. The ensuing day, the naval nobleman and his wife arrived at the castle, and the following day, Lord and the Countess of Monteagle took their departure for London—not without a sorrowful parting from the lovely and unfortunate Agnes. We will now follow the fortunes of the youthful Philip, on his way to seek his fortune, after his departure from Agnes and the castle. He had left the sea-side home of old George that day with the purpose in view of going to London. The old man had reluctantly given his consent; but he had become so proud of him after his victory on the archery ground that he was willing to indulge him in anything he asked. “But, my son,” said the aged fisherman, “London is far away from hence; and it is a world of wickedness and woe, they tell me, where men know not each other, and no one has a neighbor. Yet I will not keep you here to waste your youth in shell-fishing. I know you are fitted for better things. But you cannot go without money. Here is a purse of gold. Use it with caution, as a man without money in the big world may as well be without eyes! Ah, you groan! You are thinking of the poor child, Lady Agnes. A sad misfortune!” “And the surgeon, whom I met coming from the castle, and asked about her, yesterday, told me,” answered Philip, with emotion, “that she can never see again!” “A pitiful accident!” said the old man, shaking his white head, sorrowfully. “So fair, and young, and noble!” “She is so good, and kind, and gentle, and suffers so patiently, that I cannot but weep when I see her.” “She seems to think mightily of you, my boy; and the earl and countess praised you to me till my heart rose right up with joy. But you are not fastening on your pack! You will not go to day?” “Yes, dear father. I am ready to go now. But, as I promised, I will send you a letter from London; and you shall often hear how I get on. But you will not forget to write to me once every month how Lady Agnes is.” “I am but a poor hand at pen and ink, lad; but I will send you what news I can.” “Farewell, my dear father! I know not how to thank you for all your kindness to me. If I thought I could not do and serve you better by going away to get riches for you, I would remain. But I hope ere long to return. All our friends at the hamlet have promised me if you get sick, to take the best of care of you; and I will ask the kind Lady Agnes to inquire about you often. Good-by, my dear father! I hope soon to send you good news, for I shall try at once to find who my parents were!” The parting between this noble young man and the old fisherman who had fostered him from boyhood was touching and affecting. The old man wept on his shoulder, and, giving him a last embrace, commended him to the protection of Heaven. With his pack slung over his shoulder, Philip left the lowly cabin of his childhood, and took his way to the castle, and there, as we have seen, bidding Agnes adieu, he started on his solitary way, “the world before him all to choose.” His way lay past the church-yard, which stood, solemn and obscure, within the heavy shadow of its overarching yew-trees. He paused a moment, as he passed the porch, to offer up a silent prayer that God would prosper his journey with the success his heart desired. As he moved on, with a lighter spirit, he felt a touch upon his shoulder. He quickly turned, and beheld Dame Alice, not now attired in the wild costume of the weird woman, but in the grave and decent apparel with which we saw her half an hour later present herself at the castle, towards which she was now making her way. “Young man, whither goest thou, that thou hast need to preface thy journey with a holy prayer to Heaven?” she said, in a kindly voice. “To London,” he answered. “Thou art Philip, the foster-son of George, the fisherman?” “Yes.” “I knew thee! I saw thee on the day of the archery sports. Thou wert victor, and didst win the golden arrow; but it cost the eyes of the fairest maiden thine own eyes ever beheld!” “I would willingly lose my own to restore hers!” answered Philip, earnestly. “Thou wert not to blame! It was the fierce wrath of the Lord Cranstown which did the deed of guilt. His day will come! I saw all, and understand it all. Thou wert his successful rival, not only in the lists but in love.” “I do not know what you say, woman,” answered Philip, blushing, yet with instinctive and happy consciousness. “Can the eye, the lip, the cheek of him who loves tell tales contrary to the true heart? I watched thee and her. She loves thee, and thou regardest her with a greatness of love that thou darest not own even to thy own soul!” “I am but an humble person, and I dare not love one like Lady Agnes,” answered Philip. “I pity and feel sad for her, and—but—that is, I do not—at least, I may not look to her with love! She is to me as yonder fair star hanging in the western sky tremulous in the light of its own beauty. I gaze upon it with wonder and admiration, but I never hope to approach it! So with Lady Agnes. I gaze afar off, content to be far off, so that I may be permitted only to gaze!” “Thou art not a peasant, young man. This is not the language and the thoughts of a fisherman's son!” “I am a foundling. I am not his son! He rescued me from the sea—found me a child upon a deserted wreck, and raised me as his son. You speak to me so kindly, you have won my confidence, and so I tell you these facts freely.” “This is strange. Both children of the sea, and both loving one another with all their young hearts' fervor! This is a providence! I must not,” she continued, to herself, “cross-purpose Heaven's decrees. Then thou knowest not thy true parentage?” she asked, with deep interest. “No, mother. A few books, a compass, and a silver cup, are all that were taken from the wreck. She was so deeply sunk in the water, that George could not see her name.” “And that compass! that cup! Have you them?” “Here, in my pack!” “Let me see them.” “There is hardly light enough for you to read the names on them.” “Then there are names!” He placed the cup in her hand. She closely examined it and the stamp of the maker, “Hamel, London.” “I see what takes you up to London. You seek your parentage by these.” “Yes, but—not only this! I have a higher motive—but—but —” “Nay, do not hesitate. I am thy friend for Agnes's sake. Wouldst thou make a great name, or hopest thou to find thyself noble, that thou mayst come back and win her?” she said, smiling. “Not this only!” “Then what more eanst thou have in view? What more beside this?” “To see if there be not skill on earth, mother,” he answered, with startling emphasis and deep feeling manifested in his fine face; “to see if there be not skill on earth to restore sight to her!” “This is noble and worthy thy nature, young man,” cried Alice, warmly regarding him as he stood before her, his whole form dilated, and his bearing elevated by his one great thought. “And this, then, takes you to London!” “All else is secondary. I thought not of going until she became sightless. At first I could not keep from believing she would soon see. But as week after week her sight remained sealed up, and as the surgeons declare her blind for life, I could not calmly consent to the abandonment of all hope. The surgeon who pronounced her incurable was from Windsor, and served the queen's household; and from his decision the countess said there could be no appeal, for there was no higher authority in the realm!” “Then what do you hope for?” “I know not! I must go forward and see what I can do! France has men skilled in the eye, and I will go there! Nay, I have put a vow upon my soul never to rest or cease my search, until I can discover the skill, if it be on earth, that will give her back her sight again!” “Heaven bless you, my dear youth! This is an angel's mission you are started upon. But you cannot travel from land to land and over sea without gold!” “I have money”' “Not much, I fear. Let me see what thou hast!” “Great store, for a long journey, given me by my foster-father, George.” Here he opened his old leathern purse, and showed her a handful of small gold pieces. “This is but little, my friend! Wait you here a few moments!” Thus speaking, she disappeared in the rear of the church, and shortly after came back with a black belt in her hand. “Take this, and buckle it about your waist, beneath your frock. I have worn it many a year over sea and land. It will do thee good service.” Philip took it as she forced it into his hand. He was surprised at its weight. “Is this money?” he asked, with amazement. “Yes. One hundred pounds in golden guineas. And there are in it, besides, many silver crowns. Buckle it about you, and make no words of refusal. It is for Agnes!” “For her I take it, then, and may blessings follow you, good woman. I know you not, only that you are her friend! If you see her, tell her you met me on my way, and that I sent my humblest homage to her; but betray not for what object I go on my journey! I may fail; and then, if she cherishes hopes, these would perish also!” “I will keep your secret. Know you that I will give your message to her. I am appointed to be one of her attendants, for now she may never be left alone. I will see that she forgets you not; for I will so speak of you whom she regards, as that she will love me for your sake!” “I must now proceed on my way, as evening is advancing,” said Philip. “Farewell, and may Heaven one day bring me back with one in my company skilled to give her back her sight.” “Be courageous and persevere, and we know not what may come to pass.” Here the young man gave his hand to the woman who had, to his surprise, manifested such interest in Agnes and in his mission, and they moved off different ways, she towards the castle and he into the forest, over which the shadows of night were darkly gathering. Late in the afternoon on the ninth day after leaving the neighborhood of Castle Monteagle, Philip was slowly threading his way through the streets of London towards the Strand. He was weary and foot-sore, for he had journeyed the whole distance walking, desirous of saving every penny of his hoard for the actual needs of the future. No one regarded the youthful traveller, as he made his way amid the throng on the sidewalks. Every face, every voice, was new and strange. But he pressed on with the one idea—“sight for Agnes”—in his mind! This thought had sustained him through all his fatigues and voluntary privations. This holy purpose gave him strength above his own. He went on towards the Strand, inquiring his way every little while of such civil looking people as he met. His object in seeking the Strand was that there his cup was made; and from often thinking of this name, it seemed to his imagination to be the soul of London. It was the only name in London he ever heard, and so for the “Strand” he pressed forward. At length he came in sight of the Thames, with its forests of ships, and was soon told he was also in the great street he sought. Attained his object so far, he began to feel his fatigues, and sat down upon one of the lower steps of a large edifice whereon were seated many women and children with baskets of fruit to sell to passers-by. Like a river full to the flood of living beings the crowd rolled past, the body of the stream flowing one way and an eddy the other. The noise, motion, multitude, novelty and wonderfulness of the scene awed and amazed him. He saw no one speak to another! Thousands passed and met thousands, but he perceived take place no word or nod or look of recognition between any! The universal brotherhood of the race seemed disselved and no longer recognized! “And this is the great world of which good old George spoke,” he reflected, as he gazed on the vast crowd. “Men in it are isolated, and seem to have no common nature! Doubtless I might perish here and no eye regard me with pity, but with a hurried glance rush on. What is the death of one in such a million! What is a grain of sand dropped from a shell filled with it! But I must seek some lodging for the night, and to-morrow begin my work which I came hither to do.” He rose from the step, and, resuming his walk, came to a narrow alley, a short distance a down which he saw a sign showing that it was an inn. To the door he made his weary way, and entering a low room neatly kept, with the floor sprinkled with white sand, he laid his pack on a chair, and, exhibiting a half-crown in his hand, asked if he could be accommodated for the night. “Surely, my good youth,” answered the landlady, with a welcome smile in her eyes; “you shall have a nice supper and a good, clean bed. You have travelled far to reach London town, by your looks!” and, regarding with satisfied approbation his fine figure and handsome face, she poured out a tankard of foaming ale, and handed it to him. Philip felt at once at home, rejoicing that in the great desert of London he had found so delightful an oasis. CHAPTER VIII. The morning after his arrival in London, Philip descended to the tap-room of the inn, invigorated by rest and anxious to commence he search upon which his heart was set. It was late in the day, for fatigue had made him sleep long, and he found the good landlady had prepared his breakfast by itself in her own little back parlor. Her kind “good morning,” her pleasant smile, and the neat room, made him feel at home. “Come, sit down and have a nice breakfast, my good man,” she said, placing a chair for him. “I'll be bound you are hungry; but you look smarter than you did last night. Here is a mug of best ale, and such white bread as there is not found in every inn in London. Take a slice of this golden butter. It smells sweet of the country dairy.” As Philip ate she watched him attentively, and at length said quickly and confidently: “You are not what your dress betokens! Neither your looks nor speech nor air are low. What has brought you to London in disguise? I dare guess you are a young lord, run away from some home trouble.” “I am only a fisherman's son, good dame,” answered Philip, laughingly. “My dress and my rank quite correspond. I have passed my life in gathering shells and catching fish.” “You look greatly above your condition, not to flatter you. Now, will you tell me what has brought you up to London?” added the hostess; giving him a plateful of beef-steak. “I am come up to seek my fortune.” “That has brought many a youth to London who has never found it. But I hope you will do well. But you can never live in London by fishing and shell-gathering.” To this Philip assented. The result of this social breakfast was that he told the good woman his whole history; how he had been found at sea, raised by old George, loved Agnes, won the golden arrow, and how she had become blind. He also told her how he was in hopes to find in some country, if not in London, some one skilled to restore her to sight. Moreover, he showed her the silver cup and iron compass. That the pleasant hostess took a deep interest in his narrative need not be asserted, since she had taken so kind an interest in him for his fine face before she knew it. How potent is personal beauty! How it goes before its possessor and paves the way for good opinion. If Philip had been an ordinary-looking young fisher's lad, he would not have eaten his breakfast in the little private side-room, nor won the favor of the hostess. Beauty of person is power over us. It is a power, like money, over the minds of men. It is a power in itself that commands homage and receives it. Often it is more potent than gold, for it wins its way where gold would fail of success. “Now, the first thing for you to do, good Philip,” said his new friend, the landlady, “is to go into the Strand, round the corner, and find the silversmith who made this cup. I have heard the name, or seen the sign at least. They can, perhaps, tell you who they made it for. This will be a beginning. Here is a Directory will show you where the place is; and also `Kerr &amp; Kerr's,' where the compass was made. If you can get hold of the first step, you will be able, I doubtt not, to trace up to who your father and mother are!” “I will call and see them first; but my main wish is to consult an eye surgeon. I will go to the greatest in London, and must go to-day. Each moment is precious to Agnes, if so be there is hope left that she may see.” “You are a noble young man! You deserve to succeed; but if the queen's surgeon has pronounced the young lady incurable, have little room for hope. You will be careful and not get lost, and come back before dark.” Philip promised to do as she said, and, leaving his package in her possession, with the cup and compass, which he concluded not to take with him until he had first found the places where the makers kept, he left the inn and mingled with the human current in the Strand. It was quite three hours before he found the silver warehouse he was in search of. The door was blocked with carriages of the nobility, and many noble dames were within, selecting the most costly and beautiful silver plate that London furnished; for this house possessed the highest reputation, inasmuch as it was patronized by their majesties. Philip, in his poor garb, presented quite a contrast, even to the gay footmen of these titled dames. After some time he found opportunity to ask permission to look at silver cups. The shopman, if he had looked wholly at his dress, would have disregarded his request; but meeting his eye, and feeling the superiority of his look over his own, he moodily obeyed. All that Philip desired was to examine the stamp on the bottom of the cup. It was, he saw with satisfaction, exactly the same as that upon his own which he left in the inn. This verification filled him with hope; and, shortly leaving the place, he found his way to the compass makers', and verified the stamp upon his own there. He resolved the next day to bring both articles down, for, being numbered by the makers, it was possible that they might know to whom they had sold them, though ten or more years ago. From the compass makers' he now took his way, by frequent inquiries, towards St. James's Palace, near which he was told by the hostess that the most eminent oculist lived. The discovery of his own parentage was secondary in the mind of this noble youth to the discovery of skill to restore sight to Agnes. He reached with great difficulty, from his ignorance of the streets, the destination he sought. It was near the close of day when he found the place. Then he nearly failed seeing the great man, who, though not the king's surgeon, was eminent above him for skill in his profession in the eyes of the people. He was just entering his cab. “Sir, if you please, listen to me one moment,” cried Philip, eagerly holding by the side. “I have come all the way to London to see you! There is a noble and beauteous lady become perfectly blind, and —” “Go on!” cried the surgeon, sternly, to his coachman. Here the driver rudely started his horses, and threw the young man violently to the ground. He was not hurt; but, on rising to his feet, the cab was far beyond his reach, and he was hustled hither and thither by the crowd, until, with his disappointment and the Babel confusion around, he became bewildered and escaped from the throng by the first opening he could find. This was a narrow lane, which led to the river side. At the extremity was a sailors' tavern, and upon the bench in front he took a seat, to rest himself and recover his self-possession. “I will return there to-morrow!” he said, as he reflected upon what had just passed. “He may not have heard me with all the noise! I will go and see him early.” The sight of the river was refreshing to him. He sat and watched the boats and vessels upon it until the growing darkness warned him that it was time for him to return home to his inn. But as he looked about him, he knew not which way to go. There were three streets which met at this point, and he had forgotten which he came down. But recollecting that the Strand was near the river, he resolved to follow the streets parallel with it, until he should come into it. He had not proceeded far before he was lost among the docks and wharves, and finally, unable to tell which way to go, he stepped on board a small boat, to ask two men, who were seated, the way he should take. A waterman himself, he felt confidence in men of like craft, and so hoped to have such directions from them as would enable him to find his way. He could not see their faces distinctly, as the twilight was deepening. The boat was one of a score that lay in close to the pier-head, and all around rose the dark spars of numerous vessels that crowded so closely together that only a narrow way was left open from the quay into mid-river. “I say, Ben, this Londoner wants to know how to steer for the Strand,” said one of the men who was forward to his shipmate aft. “Ay, ay! Come aboard, my lad,” was the answer, in a gruff voice. “Can you direct me?” asked Philip, civilly. “O, that we can, without chart or compass! Take a seat aft here, and we will land you there in the turning of a reel.” “Do you pull that way?” “We shall be off in ten minutes. Take a seat on that thwart, and you shall have passage free!” “Thanks; you are very kind,” answered Philip, unsuspicious of any evil, but frankly accepting what he believed to be frankly offered. It requires many years of sad experience for youth to learn that men are a sort of beasts of prey, who prey on the weak and ignorant! that man's greatest enemy is man! and that the greatest evils suffered by men are those inflicted by their own species! Youth usually enters upon life with a heart overrunning with confidence, and believes all things; man often goes out of life with a heart sealed against his race, and suspicious of every man. Philip was soon in easy conversation with his companions; but, finding that it grew darker, and they did not start, he rose up and said he would try and find the way by land. “No, avast there, comrade,” said the elder of the two, lightly laying his hand on his shoulder, and keeping him in his seat. “We only wait for the captain. Here they come now!” he added, as a party of men drew near, walking rapidly. Part of them seemed to be armed, and to be dragging the rest along. They soon came to the boat, but not without noise and a strug gle between those who wore awords and those who seemed to be their captives. “Steady your boat, men, and stand by to receive our prisoners!” cried the leader. Philip, on seeing and hearing this, took the alarm, and rose to leap again upon the pier. But he was caught by the forward man, and drawn violently back into the boat. But he recovered, and sprang out only to be knocked down senseless with the back of a cutlass; for the men in the boat had cried to those on the pier: “Seize him! He is our man!” The press-gang boat, for such was the trap into which Philip had unconsciously walked, having taken on board four men, Philip making the fifth, put off from the pier and rowed out of the dock. Many a muttered oath was sent after it from the decks of the vessels it rowed past, for sailors love not well the sight of this infamous press-gang. The boat, which was a man-of-war's fourth cutter, having gained the stream, pulled down swiftly through the heart of the parted city, now shooting beneath a bridge, now drawing in shore to avoid vessels, now barely escaping collision with the wherries of watermen. A thousand lights, on both shores, were reflected in the river, and the sounds of the streets filled the air, like a storm roaring through a forest. Voices in all keys reached their ears, from the gruff call of seamen to the startling shriek of a female. Swiftly the cutter kept on her way. “Who is the lad in the fore-sheets?” asked the lieutenant of the gang, in a cold, unfeeling tone, speaking for the first time since they had left the pier. “A country youth, sir. Said he was a fisherman. Lost his way, and came to ask us; and we kept him on board!” “The bounty is fairly yours, lads,” he answered, “if he gets over the blow. You strike too hard, Gordon, unless you mean to kill your men.” “He was all but off, sir,” answered the man, apologetically. “Hit less hard next time. The lad is still insensible; but his head bleeds, and he will soon come to.” “Shall I duck him, sir?” asked Gordon. “No. We shall soon have him board ship! All these fellows fought hard, and the surgeon will have work to do for us. These five will 4 make up our complement of men, and to-morrow we weigh and put to sea.” “May I ask, sir,” said one of the pressed men, who had been, with his follows, hitherto silent, except uttering an oceasional oath or groan, “what port you are to sail to?” “You may ask, my man, but to get an answer is another thing,” replied the officer, with a hard laugh. The cutter was now passing the dark walls of the Tower of London, and, after a quarter of an hour's rowing, drew up alongside of a frigate that was moored in the middle of the Thames. The captives, some of them earnestly protesting and struggling against being taken on board, were speedily transferred to the ship's decks. Philip remained insensible, and was placed in the care of the surgeon, who had him conveyed to the cockpit. In an hour after being in his hands, Philip revived, but only to fall into a heavy sleep. The kind surgeon watched over him with humane attention, and at the end of several hours' sleep he awoke with a look of intelligence. He gazed with surprise and wonder about upon the sides of the cockpit, lighted by a lantorn, and then inquiringly upon the face of the surgeon's mate, who reported to his chief that he had awaked. “Where am I? I know not this place! How came I here?” he murmured. “You are in good hands, my man,” answered the surgeon. “You must he quiet, and all will be right at last. Here is a sedative; take it and sleep awhile.” When Philip awoke in the morning, he was perfectly conscious. He was trying to make out where he last was and where he now found himself; but was lost in amazement and conjecture. Suddenly the detonation of heavy cannon shook the ship, and made him leap from the hammock. Peal followed peal, and the noise was overpowering to his hearing. It seemed as if he were in the midst of a roaring volcano. “Do not be alarmed, shipmate,” said an old boatswain, who was lying on his back, sick. “You don't seem to know your reckoning exactly.” “Will you inform me how I came here, and what this all is?” he asked, earnestly. “You are on board his majesty's frigate, the `Conqueror.”' “And how?” “Pressed! You may take it quietly, and make up your mind to go to Malta in her!” “It was then a press-boat I must have got on board of,” he said to himself. “What am I to do? What do they wish with me?” he demanded of the boatswain. “To make a sailor of you, and teach you to serve your country!” “I will die first before I am carried away from England in this way! I have a great work to do! I came to London to—to —” “No matter what, my lad! When a man is pressed, he breaks all bonds! Wife, children, parents, friends, count nothing in the scale against the king's service. Have you ever been to sea?” he asked, kindly. “I was raised a fisherman.” “So much the better. You will take to it kindly. It is enough to break the heart of a proper green-grass landsman, to compel him to serve on board a man-of-war.” “But I must go on shore! The happiness of one of the —” “No matter were it your own mother's happiness that is at stake! The king's service is topmost of all. If a man has a heart, he must hide it under his blue jacket when the king's ship has need of him.” “It is a hard fate!” said Philip, with tremulous lips. “Poor Lady Agnes! It is impossible now that I can do anything for you! I may never, never behold you more!” Tears filled his eyes, and he buried his face in his hands in passionate grief. At this moment he was called to come on deck to be mustered with the other men who had been pressed. On reaching the light of day on the upper deck, he found himself surrounded with large cannon, a numerous crew of man-of-war's-men, and before him were several officers. He could see over the bulwarks only sky and water, for the frigate had long before gained an offing, and was now in mid-channel on her way to Portsmouth, whence she was to take her final departure for the Mediterranean. About thirty men were arranged in line before the quarter-deck and inspected, their names taken down, ages, and the occupations each had followed. Philip's replies were brief and almost defiant. His face was pale as marble, and the fine outline of his features was more striking than ever. His noble air and handsome face drew the attention of the officers, and he knew that he was the subject of remark. The third day the frigate anchored in Portsmouth. Here she took on board some troops, and on the second day thereafter weighed anchor. While in port, Philip, who was chafing like a young lion in a cage, under his captivity, made an unsuccessful attempt to escape by swimming from the frigate, but was discovered, taken up by a boat, and put in irons. In this unhappy condition he remained until the frigate had been three days at sea; when he was released, reprimanded, and ordered to go to his duty among the men. Leaving our hero for a time to his untoward fate, we will now return to the inn in London which he had left in the morning to go in search of the eye-surgeon, from whom he had received so rough a reception. But great men, unless great in benevolence also, do not stoop to regard lowliness in homespun. Doubtless, if a young lord had addressed the man of skill, he would have alighted and listened with his hat in his hand! When night came and the street lamps were all a-light, yet without bringing her youthful guest home, the good Dame Cresset of “The Arrow” began to feel apprehensions for his safety. “Who do you look up and down so often for, fair hostess?” said a customer, in a faded military coat, who was taking a can of ale by a little table in the tap-room. “You seem to expect some one.” “Yes, captain, I look for a nice young man, who said he should return long before night. He came in last night from Lincolnshire, and put up at `The Arrow.' I never took such a liking to a body, he is so handsome and gentle-spoken!” “Perhaps he had no money to pay his scot, and keeps away altogether! Handsome faces don't often have handsome pockets!” “You are always thinking evil, captain! The young man not only paid before he went, like a lord, but I have his bundle here, and it contains in it a silver cup worth many a silver crown-piece!” “Ah, well, that alters the case! What said you his name was?” “I only know that it is Philip! He went out, he said, to—to —” Here Dame Cresset hesitated whether she ought to make the red-nosed captain a confidant of the young strunger's narration. But the captain was an old friend of her deceased husband, a customer of many years standing, and a man of heart and good feeling. He had years ago retired on half-pay, and, as he was a bachelor and loved a quiet place, “The Arrow” became his favorite abiding-place. So, after going again to the inn door, and looking up and down, and sighing heavily, she sat down opposite the captain, and, in a confidential tone, told him all she knew about Philip, and on what errand he had come to London. “This is an interesting tale, good Cresset,” said he, “and I do not feel surprised that you take an interest in him and are anxious for his return. I fear that being a stranger in London he has got lost; or perhaps fallen into the hands of rogues, if he took any money with him.” “That did he! He showed me that he had ten gold pieces in a purse, which he said the old man, his foster-father, gave him when he came away; and he added, that he knew where he could lay his hands on more.” “Be sure, if he does not return to-night, and has not lost himself,” said the captain, “that he has been robbed.” “O, I do not wish to think such a dreadful thought!” cried the hostess, with emotion. “We will hope for the best.” Morning came, and yet Philip had not made his appearance at the inn. Good Dame Cresset had no heart for her breakfast. She feared the worst. She went about quite overcome with her anxieties, and was more than half of a mind to go and search for him! His bundle attracting her eye, she opened it and showed the cup and compass to the captain, who examined them attentively. “I will go to these manufacturing shops, good dame, and ask if he has been there.” “You are too kind, dear Captain Bodley,” she said, with gratitude. “And if you hear nothing of him there, please go to the great eye-surgeon near St. James's Palace—Dr. —; I forget his name. Find out if he has been seen at either place.” “I will do it cheerfully, good hostess. I will do my best to hunt him up. But how is he to be described?” “Tall, about eighteen years of age, straight, and rather dark complexion, with a handsome brown face, and an eye black and piercing. He carries his head well up, and seems to walk as if he feared no man. He was dressed in a snuff-colored frock, bound with a belt buckled round his waist, blue woolsey trowsers, and wore a seal-skin cap. His black hair curled beneath it all about his neck.” “Well, this is a pretty description, dame! have some curiosity to see him myself. Be sure I will do my best to find him. His history has a sort of romance about it, what with the blind maiden and the silver cup. But what is this?” exclaimed the captain, who, having put on his hat and taken his cane, was looking into the knapsack. “It is a gold arrow—real gold, as I live!” cried Dame Cresset, taking the arrow in her hand, which the captain had discovered sticking out of the bundle. “It is heavy enough, and looks pure enough, for true metal,” answered the captain, balancing it on his finger. “How strange he should have this—and gold, too! For my house is the sign of `The Arrow!”' “And if you hear no more from him, you will have a sign of gold!” “Do not talk so, Captain Bodley! I would give fifty crowns in gold rather than not see that nice young man again!” “Well, I will do my best,” answered the half-pay captain, and, bidding her good morning, he proceeded to the Strand and to the silversmith's in search of Philip. Here no one could give any more account of him than that such a youth had asked to see silver cups; and at the compass makers' he obtained information that such a person had been there; but beyond this he could ascertain nothing. Thence he took a cab, and in an hour was at St. James's. Here he learned, from the porter of the surgeon, that a young man answering his description had spoken to the doctor, but had been thrown down by the wheel; but whether he was hurt or not he could not say, nor could he say what became of him. The captain became by this time deeply interested in knowing the fate of the youthful stranger, and, having commenced the search for him, he resolved to pursue it. He drove to an old-fashioned club-house, where he sometimes resorted, and looked over the papers at the list of casualties the day before, to see if the young man had not been taken to one of the hospitals. But he found no allusion to any accident of the kind named by the porter. “He was not, then, much hurt,” said the captain, musingly. “He must have left the place to try and reach the Arrow Inn, and is lost, doubtless having forgotten its name and the name of the lane it is in.” It was near the close of the day when he returned to the inn and reported his day's efforts to Dame Cresset. The good woman burst into tears, and felt like taking her bonnet and going all over London in search of him; for she felt not only an interest in him, but she felt, as it were, responsible for him, since he had been her guest. “The only way is to advertise in the Times,” said the captain. “Yes, we will do that at once!” cried the hostess, with a ray of hope brightening up her fair and kindly features. “Write one at once, captain, and I will be at all costs.” “Give me a pen and ink, good dame,” answered the captain, putting on his spectacles. Between them the following advertisement was completed: “Lost.—Five Guineas Reward. “A young man, about eighteen years of age, five feet ten inches high, with brown complexion, dark hazel eyes very bright, and black curling hair, left the Arrow Inn on the morning of the 27th, to go to St. James's Palace. He was an entire stranger in London; and, as he has not returned, and had considerable money in his purse, it is feared he has met with foul play, or is lost. He wore a snuff-colored Lincolnshire frock, blue kersey trowsers, and a brown seal-skin cap with a visor. He has a proud air, and is gentle-spoken. “Apply at the Arrow Inn, Bell Lane. “Dame Crosset.” CHAPTER IX. The advertisement of the lost young stranger duly appeared in the newspapers. Dame Cresset felt that she had done her duty herewith, and she hoped that by means of it some news might reach “The Arrow.” Closely did she and the half-pay captain examine, in vain, the columns of the Times for a response. Two weeks passed by, and she had tearfully made up her mind that he was drowned, or had been murdered for his ten pieces of gold which he had in his belt; of the much larger amount concealed in his breast, she was ignorant, as Philip, in all his confidence, had not made it known to her. It was, however, fully four weeks, before she quite gave up all hopes of ever hearing from him again. It was with a sorrowful heart that she came to this painful conclusion. The contents of the knapsack of the young man now became, very naturally, objects of attention. Bringing them into the tap-room, she found the worthy captain smoking his pipe and thinking whether it were wisdom in him to give up the peculiar comforts and independence of his bachelor life, and press his long pending suit for the hand of the widow and her two thousand six hundred and seven pounds in the three per cents, her snug inn, and not to speak of her many wifely virtues. While he was thus meditating, she came in with the knapsack. Of course, she did not know what his thoughts were engaged upon. It is true, he had often talked to her, while smoking, about the advantages of a husband to a lone woman; and he had more than once hinted, at a great distance, that his half-pay and his rank would present quite a respectable consideration to a wise woman, were he inclined to marry. But Dame Cresset never seemed to take the hint; and he was apprehensive, if he pressed matters home, he might, lose her favor, and so be compelled to give up his corner in the neat tap-room. “Poor boy!” said the widow, plaintively, as she placed the knapsack on the table on which the captain's elbow was leaning. The half-pay officer looked not at the knapsack, but at the fair widow. His eye seemed to inspect her face as if he were contemplating some bold measure. He was not amiss in his looks for a man of fifty-one. He had a martial, red face, grey locks, was something portly, and had a pleasant smile always a-twinkling about his gray eyes. He was a man of sense, had been a brave warrior, and limped from a sabre wound across his knee. He loved ease, quiet and a pipe, and Widow Cresset. “Widow, I am thinking—” he began boldly. “I know it—about the dear boy!” she said, sorrowfully. “No—about something still more dear!” “This silver cup! yes—we ought to—” “Not the cup, but the hand it is in! Widow Cresset, I have made up my mind that I must marry!” “Do not do anything so foolish, Captain Bodley, said the widow, with a sharp speech, but coloring with pretty consciousness. “I have made up my mind!” said the half-pay captain, with emphasis; “I have known you, wife and widow, nine years! You are the only woman that could make me surrender. I capitulate, this morning, without challenge.” “Go out with your military phrases,” said the blushing widow. She did not, however, look angry nor say “nay.” So the captain took courage, and took her by the hand. “Will you consent? You know me! You know my ways and tempers!” “Yes—you are a good customer, but I don't know if you may make as good a husband.” “Try me, fair widow!” “On one condition;” and she let her hand rest in his. “Name it, were it to take the tower of London!” “That you find Philip! That you bring me some intelligence about him!” “That is a hard condition, widow!” said the captain, looking blank. Doubtless he is dead!” “I fear me he is so! But I would like to know his fate! Bring me some information about him, and—and—” “And you will be Mistress Captain Bodley?” “Yes—I will marry you—for I do think we would be happy together!” “I am sure of it! But if you abide by this condition, I fear that—” “It is the only condition, captain! You have nothing else to do but go about London and hear what you can!” “Faint heart never won a true woman! I will accept the condition, for six months—nay, for three months!” “For six months!” “And then?—” “Then we will talk about other conditions.” “Ah, Widow Cresset, you must not be too cruel to an old soldier who would—” “I don't want to hear what you will do; I only wish to have you begin to do what I wish.” “I will commence my Herculean task this very day. First, had I not best go to the silversmith's, and take the cup with me, and see if he can tell who bought it?” “And what good will this do?” “It is possible that it may give me a clue to find out who his parents were; and it is barely possible that he may in the same way have discovered them, and, forgetting all else, be now with them, and unable, from his ignorance of London, to return here to unfold to you his good fortune.” “This is an idea I never thought of!” “It only just occurred to me, widow. You see the hopes you hold out to me sharpen my wits. I will take the cup and compass, and follow this scent first. I cannot think he can be murdered!” “But if he had found his relatives, he would have seen the advertisement, or some of them would.” “Perhaps not. Good morning, fair Cresset, I will be diligent in my task. But here is a little book in the pocket of this coat. It is a small and well-worn prayer-book!” “Doubtless he was a pious youth, he seemed so gentle and good,” said the hostess, sighing. “Here is a part of a picture and a name on the first page.” “The part of a picture, as you term it, is the half of a coat of arms; and the name is so faded that I can only make out, `Cla'—`lia.' This book might lead to something, if these were not so defaced.” “It looks as if he was well-born.” “It may not be his own—perhaps some one given to him by some of the gentility in his parish. It doesn't prove anything.” An hour after leaving the inn, the captain was at the silversmith's on the Strand. He had now a motive for making the most stringent investigations. “Sir,” he said to the chief salesman, “I have here a silver cup. Will you tell me if it was made by your house!” “Yes, sir. You see our stamp!” answered the man, looking at it. “It is an old-fashioned pattern, and must have been bought a long time since.” “Can you tell me when?” “Let me see! The number is nearly worn off. I have it—249. That must have been sold about twenty years ago.” “Be so kind as to ascertain.” “Indeed, sir, it will be no little trouble. Its sale must have been recorded in the old books which are stowed away.” “I am ready to pay for what trouble your clerks may be put to, if you are sure you can discover when it was sold and to whom.” “Without doubt, when—but as to the whom, it is not so certain. In those days, we were not so particular in making such full records of plate sales as we do now. But, as you seem, sir, very anxious to ascertain the fact, you are at liberty to go into that room and examine the old books. You will find the year labelled on each, and you had best go back twenty years ago.” The captain thanked the silversmith, and was shown by a lad into an old lumber-room. Here he found the books of sales, covered with dust and cobwebs. After some trouble, he found that of twenty years before; and looking over the index which named the articles sold and the page where the sale was registered, he found many silver cups, but none with so high a number as that he held in his hand. So he came down a year later; and finding that the last cup sold that year was numbered 235, he knew that he was near the end of his long search. The next volume bore, under letter “C,” in the index, this record: “Cup (silver)—No. 249—vide page 57.” Turning to the page indicated, he read, with joy, the following entry: “May 7, 1781. To Lady Wortley Devon 1 chased silver cup, No. 249—£6 8s.” “I have now a clue to the labyrinth—I have hold of the end of the thread,” said the captain, with animation. “But,” he reflected, “what good will this discovery do the poor youth? Evidently he has not found his friends, for he has not been here to examine these books. He is not with them, unless, indeed, he has discovered them through the compass. I will next go to the nautical instrument shop and learn what is to be revealed there!” Having carefully noted down the entry upon his private pocket-book, he left the lumber-room, and thanking the shopman for his courtesy, departed for the place where the compass was sold. “At all events, the purchaser of the cup was of the highest nobility!” he mused, as he went along; “and Dame Cresset may be right in her conjectures that he comes of good blood. But then there is no evidence that the cup found on the deck and the child rescued from the vessel are necessarily connected. But here is the compass-maker's shop! Doubtless, if I can get a link here, I can learn by-and-by what ship had the instrument.” “Sir,” he said, as he entered, addressing an old man in round iron spectacles, who was fitting a polar needle accurately to its centre, on the pivot of a new compass, “will you allow me to occupy a few moments of your time?” The old man did not raise his eyes until he had completed the tremulous adjustment. Then pushing his great glasses back upon his forehead, he looked sharply at the captain, when, seeing his military coat, he bowed with respectful consideration. “How can I serve you, sir?” he asked, with a serving smile. “I have here an old compass,” answered the captain, unwrapping the instrument from his red pocket-handkerchief. “Has any one called here—a youth—to ask you about it?” “Not that I recollect, sir. Why, that is one of my own make! It is an old one! I have not seen one of mine of that date for a long time!” and the compass-maker took it and examined it with evident satisfaction. “Then it is of your own manufacture?” “There is our name, `Kerr &amp; Kerr!”' “Can you tell me how long ago it was that you sold it?” “Let me see! Here you see the number, on the inside of the rim. It is No. 106. We had not made many compasses then!” “Is it possible for you to remember to whom you sold it?” “Perhaps our old books will show!” “May I ask you to take the trouble to look into them? The ship, on which this compass was found, was lost on the Lincolnshire coast ten or twelve years ago, and circumstances render it important that the name of the vessel should be discovered, in order to know who her passengers were, for a child was rescued from the wreck at the same time with the compass, and if we can ascertain the name of the ship, we may possibly learn whose child was thus saved!” “True—true! This is a very interesting affair! I will do what I can. Let me see—No. 106—that must have been about—about—let me see—about the year 1779 or '80. It will be easy to refer to my sales book of those years, as I always have everything in order and at hand!” Opening a large oaken case, he laid his hands upon one of a score of large sales books. On the back was printed “1779, 1780.” He laid it open before the captain and began to examine the index. It gave only the names of the ships or of persons to whom articles had been sold. “It will take some trouble and time, sir, to look over each name. But if you will examine the book and look for the first entry of a compass sold, its number will indicate pretty nearly how far in the book from it may be found 106.” The captain opened the book at the beginning, and examined full thirty entries of sales before the words, “Mariner's compass, No. 62, sold the brig Adonis,” met his eyes. He now knew that the compass which he had must have been sold later. So he turned over the leaves rapidly, here and there, among entries of spy-glasses, hour-glasses, quadrants, sextants, and all sorts of nautical instruments, catching sight of the words, “compass, 73,” “compass, 81,” “compass, 96,” “compass, No. 100,” “mariner's compass, No. 105.” He now examined carefully each page, until, at length, he read—and they seemed to his rejoicing eyes to be written in letters of gold: “On 4th January, 1780, two mariner's compasses to ship `Exeter Castle,' Nos. 106 and 107.” There were other entries to the ship, but this one alone fixed the eyes of the captain. Pointing it out to the maker, he said, with animation: “Here is what I look for! Do you recollect the call?” “The Exeter Castle! It was Captain Norman who was master. He bought them here himself. I recollect the captain well! and now I think of it, I recollect a report some years ago that he and his ship had been lost at sea—or, at least, had never been heard from. She belonged to Newcastle on Tyne!” “This is all I want to know, just now,” said Captain Bodley, as he finished copying the entry of this important sale into his note book. “Sir, I am greatly obliged to you for the favor you have done me.” He hastened along the Strand, overjoyed at his success thus far in this direction; for, though he was no nearer on the track of the missing Philip, yet he had obtained a clue to discover who he was, which would be something towards gaining favor with Widow Cresset. Nay, more; he had begun to take a lively interest in following out the mystery for curiosity's sake. In another hour, he was again at “The Arrow,” and detailing to the widow the result of his day's work. “Well, captain, you deserve praise and shall have it,” she said, warmly. “I am sure he will turn out to be high-born—for he looked and spoke it! A great lady bought the cup, and she, perhaps, was his mother!” “Do not be too sanguine, fair widow. The cup and the boy may have no necessary connection. The child rescued may have been the son of a poor passenger, while the cup might have belonged to a rich child who was lost.” “You always look so on the wrong side of everything, Captain Bodley,” said the widow, with some anger. “But I would not have your hopes raised to be disappointed!” “What matters now—hopes or fears,” she said, sorrowfully. “The poor boy is dead!” “I do not think so! Do you know that a murder cannot be hid in London, with its three millions of eyes and six millions of hearing ears! We should have heard of him, if he had been killed. As I was coming along, I was delayed by a press-gang. They had two young men in custody, one of whom was desperately fighting his captor, while the other wept like an infant. The thought struck me, as I saw them dragged past, that Philip, your favorite, might have been pressed!” The widow shrieked, and for a moment seemed to be overcome by the terrible idea. “It must be so! It is what has become of him! I wonder I had not thought of it before. I have had in my day at least twenty persons, who had lodged here, pressed and carried to sea.” “His costume was that of a Lincolnshire sailor, and he was the very youth a press-gang would desire!” “What can be done?” “It is hard to say! It would be impossible to find what ship he is on board of, if, as I now believe, he is pressed. Such is the demand for men now, in this coming war with France, that all ships are pressing, and no plain man is safe in the streets after dark.” “It is an infamous practice, and if I were a pressed sailor,” said the widow, indignantly, “I would turn the guns against my captors: I would not serve my country as a captive.” “You are right. The great English heart is cowed by its habitual and hereditary submission to nobles and to petty tyranny of the titled landlords. They are not free, but slaves—and so they submit, when pressed by violence, to the masters whose feet have been on their necks for eight centuries.” “What shall be done?” “I see no way of learning his fate!” “You shall have money to aid you.” “But money is not all. I must have influence with the admiralty.” “What then?” “They could ascertain at once what ship-of-war received pressed men on the night of Philip's disappearance; and if he were on board, they could find it out. There are many war ships in the Thames, and even if I should ascertain that any one of them took on board men, and should inquire, I should receive no answer. No revelations of this kind are ever made by the officers, except by authority.” “Do you know any great lords who could help us in this matter?” “Not one! I am too obscure now, and have been forgotten by the few nobility I once knew in my best army days.” “If I was certain he was pressed, I would go to the Admiralty myself—” “Only to be disappointed and ill-entreated! You could never get past the out-works of menials and liveried sentries, to reach head-quarters. You would fail in approaching the citadel! But who is here?” His abrupt inquiry had reference to a man in the costume of a Thames waterman, who, pale and weak, staggered into the door. Dame Cresset, supposing he was intoxicated, would sharply have bidden him begone; but the captain's more practised eye saw that the man's irregular gait proceeded from debility. “Excuse me, ma'am! I have a writing for you! I am weak, and will sit down, if you please!” Here he took a chair and began to search his pocket, and took out a piece of paper, soiled and crumpled. “It was the lining of his cap, ma'am!” “Whose?” “He tore it out, ma'am, and gave it me!” “Who are you talking about, man?” asked the captain, at a loss. “Why, the—the young man! Here is the paper he gave me!” “Philip—can it be from Philip?” almost shrieked the widow, as with trembling fingers she opened the piece of paper. “I don't know his name, ma'am! He had black eyes and hair! When he writ it in his cap and tore it out and gave it to me, I promised, if ever I reached shore, I'd sacredly bring it to you at `The Arrow.' I'd have done it sooner, ma'am, but they shot me in the side as I was swimming; and I have only got about again to-day.” “It is from Philip! Hear what he says!” cried the hostess, between smiles and tears. “Dear Dame Cresset: I lost my way—I was pressed in a man-of-war—I am now a prisoner. This man, Bolton, says he will give you this, if he escapes free. Take care of my things! I do not know the name of the ship—but I hope yet to escape, sooner or later. Farewell. “Philip.” “Poor, dear young man!” ejaculated the hostess, wiping her eyes. “It is then as we feared! But it is some comfort to know he is alive! Here, my good man! drink this can of beer. You look pale and weak!” “So you were a pressed man, also?” asked the captain, of the waterman, after he had set down the empty can. “Yes, sir; I was pressed the same time he was! But I knew their ways and kept quiet and let them think I was well contented to serve my country. When we got to the boat, we found the young man Philip in the hands of two of the oarsmen. He afterwards told me he had lost his way and had gone to the boat to ask them to direct him to the Strand; and that when he would have left, they seized him. He came near escaping from the gang, but was knocked down and taken aboard senseless!” “Infamous!” cried the captain. “Poor boy! did it hurt him much?” asked the widow. “He came to, after awhile, and was good as new, only a little heavy about the head. I took a fancy to him, and he told me how he should feel happier if he could let you know where he was. So I up and told him I had made up my mind to escape by swimming; for I am a waterman, and we swim, sir, like sharks, you know. So he wrote on the lining of his cap what you read, and the same night I dropped out of a port into the river. The sentinel soon saw me. I watched the flash of his musket and dove; but a boat was sent after me, and a pistol shot from one of them hit me in the side. At the same moment, I grasped hold of the cable of a ship near the pier, climbed upon her deck, and, making my way along her bowsprit, dropped upon the quarter of another vessel and so on, from craft to craft, till I reached the pier. Here I was so weak from loss of blood, that I should have fallen, but for two of my comrades, watermen, who having heard the noise of the chase, placed me into their boat, and pulled me beyond pursuit, and thence took me to one of their houses, and cared for me so well I am now on my feet again.” “You shall now stay in my house,” said the widow, “until you get entirely well, and at no charges. You have done me and Philip service.” “And I dare say that you will reward him, fair Widow Cresset, as I hoped to have been, since he, and not I, has brought news of your favorite.” This was spoken half in jest; half in earnest, by the captain. “What a speech, captain!” said the hostess, with a smile. “I will once more make conditions, that you may have hopes yet.” “Name them, were it to capture the frigate!” said the half-pay officer, gallantly. “That you get him from this frigate! You say that you do not know the name of this vile ship?” she asked of the waterman. “No. But I might learn it.” “Do so, and you shall be well rewarded.” “I can inquire among the watermen, and learn what frigate was then anchored below the tower.” “This will be easy,” said the captain. “But it will be impossible to recover the young man. Besides, the vessel has sailed ere this, for she was only waiting men; and I heard the lieutenant of the press-gang say that we made up her full complement, and that they would put to sea the next day. They are a thousand miles off now.” The hostess clasped her hands in distress, and looked appealingly heavenward, as if she had no hope of aid on earth. “How did he seem when you left him?” she asked the waterman. “He bore up bravely; but he seemed to feel most for a young lady he called Agnes, who was blind, he said, and he had come to London to try and find some one to cure her.” “Yes, he had her in his thoughts, you may be sure! Captain Bodley,” she added, turning to him with decision, “what is now to be done?” “If this worthy man will make the inquiries he proposes, and bring the name of the frigate, I will see what can be done. But I fear—” and here he shook his head despondingly. “Fear what?” “That I can do nothing.” “But suppose you could ascertain by the silver cup that he was of noble blood, couldn't you then interest—” “Your bright wits have given me just the idea! I will follow up diligently the thread found at the stores! It may lead to something favorable. If it does, why, there may be higher interest than mine set to work in his behalf. But let me say beforehand, that all is doubt and uncertainty; for—” “But it must be seen whether doubt may not end in certainty. I have read of as marvellous things as that Philip should turn out to be a lord, in some of my girl-day's novels.” “Yes, but we are not acting parts in a novel, dear dame, but are real flesh and blood, living and real persons. Ours is common life!” “I have my hopes, nevertheless!” “And I my doubts! But what would I not undertake for your fair hand, dear Mistress Cresset! Be sure I will leave no stone unturned to see where leads the thread of circumstances I hold in my hand, and the end of which I picked up at the silversmith's and compass-maker's.” A long consultation now followed as to the expediency of the captain's calling on Lady Devon, or advertising the cup, and also asking for information as to the last port which the “Exeter Castle” sailed from. It was finally decided to try the columns of the Times once more, in the hopes of ascertaining the information they knew not how so well to obtain in any other way. CHAPTER X. The scenes of our narrative now change from the humble inn of “The Arrow,” to a noble and ancient castle in the north of England. It is six days after the scene in the inn, which closed the preceding chapter. In a sumptuous chamber in this lordly home of one of the aristocratic families of England, sat a lady, about thirty-eight years of age. She was still handsome, but her fine features wore a pensive cast. Near her, by the table, sat a tall, soldierly-looking gentleman, whose hair was slightly gray. He was reading the London Times, which had that morning been brought from the post-office. “What news, my lord?” she asked, looking up from a piece of embroidery which she was engaged upon. “Not much, Mary,” he answered, in a pleasant voice; “not much, wife. War news, only— which does not interest you ladies.” “No—unless we have those we love in the field. I trust you will not be engaged, dear husband, in the coming struggle with France?” questioned the countess. “No—I am invalided. I have done with war.” “If our dear boy had lived, he would now have been of an age to serve his country, like his ancestors.” “Yes—he would have been about nineteen. But do not speak of the past, Mary! Your memory is to-day as sensitive as ever it was upon this painful subject.” “How can I ever forget? And such a death!” “It was the will of Heaven!” “I have submitted! I have bowed my will to this! I have tried to say `His will be done!”' “It was an unfortunate day when we consented to embark from Newcastle to Gibraltar.” “The dread night we spent upon the few planks upon the sea can never be obliterated!” “We should be thankful for our own safety, by means of the ship so providentially passing us in the morning.” “But if he, if our own dear Henry, had been also saved!” “Let us cease to speak of this dark past, my dear Lady Mary. It only increases sorrow, and cannot recall the lost.” The lady's eyes sparkled with tears, and she resumed her embroidery with a look of sadness. The noble lord resumed his reading of the gazette, though it was some moments before he could fix his attention to what his eyes travelled over. Suddenly, after eagerly reading something for a moment to himself, he exclaimed: “Hear this! Can it be that—” “What is it, my lord?” she asked. “Listen, and tell me what you think of it:” “INFORMATION WANTED. “If any one can give information as to the last port out of which the ship `Exeter Castle' sailed, some ten years ago, or more, they are requested to send to, or call at the “Arrow Inn,” Bell Lane, near the Strand, where any intelligence about said ship will be handsomely paid for. “P. S.—If the purchaser of a silver cup, No. 249, of `Hamel,' Strand, in 1782, or thereabouts, will call at `The Arrow,' they will learn something greatly to their advantage.” When the Earl of Devon—for such was the rank of the nobleman, had finished reading, with nervous rapidity, this two-fold advertisement, he laid down the paper, and gazed fixedly at his wife, whose returning gaze was one of amazement and trepidation. She trembled—she scarcely knew why. “Can it be that—” she hurriedly articulated, in her agitation. “This is all very remarkable! The `Exeter Castle' was not only our ship, in which we sailed and were wrecked, but you bought a silver cup, if I recollect aright, at—” “Yes, and in that year, also, I believe, at Hamel's! It was lost, with everything else, in the wreck. It was Henry's. But what can these advertisements mean?” “It is very strange! Perhaps some one is equally interested with ourselves in that ill-fated ship.” “But the silver cup? I certainly purchased one at Hamel's!” “Do you recollect the number?” “No, I do not,” answered the lady. “It is mentioned here as 249. There may have been other cups bought and on board that ship.” “But the advertisement does not say that the cup was found with the vessel,” said the lady, deeply interested. “But both are united in one advertisement; both references are to the `Arrow Inn,”' said the nobleman, whose interest was now wholly awakened. “In this ship all our dearest hopes were lost, my lord! Whatever concerns it, that is now revived, may concern us; especially when a silver cup, bought at Hamel's, is connected with it; and such a cup was in the ship, belonging to our dear boy!” “What would you suggest, Mary?” asked the Earl of Devon, half anticipating her reply, if one might judge, by the expression of her dark, fine eyes. “That we go up to London one week sooner than we contemplated going.” “What! and call at `The Arrow?”' “Yes. I feel in my soul that this advertisement interests us both more closely than we imagine.” “We will depart the day after to-morrow. I must confess it has awakened in me a keen desire to ascertain what the object of the advertisement is.” “It asks for the information, too, we have the power to give. We know whence she sailed, and her fate.” “We will go to London as soon as possible,” answered the earl, again carefully reading the advertisement, and taking down the address of “The Arrow.” Two days afterwards they left their princely seat, and took their way towards London. They went with vague and undefined hopes. There was a mystery connected with the advertisement which they instinctively felt in some way concerned themselves and their lost child! The earl had found the day before, after long search, the bill of plate bought at Hamel's, and the number of the cup was two hundred and forty-nine, the same that was advertised. This discovery made their journey far from an unmeaning one. Hope filled their hearts; yet neither breathed to the other the secret thought of their souls—“Can he yet live?” On the morning of the second day they passed near an ancient and warlike-looking castle. “That is Castle Clan-William,” said the earl, pointing it out to his wife. “It was for centuries the abode of a race of noble earls. The fate of the last two earls was tragical, and since then the castle has been unoccupied, save by a seneschal.” “Was not the old lord poisoned?” “Yes; and by his own son, Robert. This young nobleman was a wild liver, and was in need; and impatient for his father's title and wealth, and tempted by the devil, he poisoned him. It was a dreadful crime, but known only sometime afterwards. The parricide fled, and having been at the same time accused of treason, he was pursued both by the criminal and state officers. But he escaped for a time. But vengeance suffered him not to live; for it is said, and believed, that he cast himself into the sea to escape his pursuers. Crime always has a voice to betray itself, and always seems to be punished, even in this life.” “Left he no heir?” “Yes, an infant daughter—so rumor says— whom he cruelly cast off, leaving her in the hands of a foster-mother.” “What became of her?” “It is not known. Should she make her appearance, it is not probable that she could inherit, as the estate of the treasonous parricide has been confiscated to the crown.” They rode on through the green scenery of England, and on the evening of the third day entered London by the great northern road, just as the lamps were being kindled in the streets. The ensuing morning, about eleven o'clock, the half-pay captain at the inn of “The Arrow” was taking a luncheon of cheese and ale, and reading over, for the hundredth time, his advertisement in the Times; for not being much given to literary efforts, the worthy captain looked upon this composition with no little pride and complacency. The widow was knitting by the window that looked out on the lane. “It is now two weeks nearly, and no answer to this advertisement,” said the captain. “It is a pity,” sighed the widow. “I have about made up my mind to make a journey into the north, and see this Lady Devon, for I understand from the Peerage Book that their seat is near the Tyne, not far from Newcastle.” “If it is necessary to go, you shall have the money to bear the expenses. But here is a brave equipage—arms, and liveries, and gay horses!” she exclaimed, looking from the window. “It must be a lord, and not less!” “Yes, a titled personage,” said the captain, going to the window on hearing her exclamations. “Bless us, they are stopping here!” she cried, rising up in great excitement. “What can have brought such great people to `The Arrow!' Quick, captain! unlock the best parlor; and please throw the shutters open. I will go and receive them.” “Perhaps it is somebody to answer the advertisement,” suggested the sanguine captain, as he obeyed his orders with much alacrity, thereby fore-shadowing his obedience as her future husband, should such a desirable event happen. “This is the `Arrow Inn,' I believe?” said the Earl of Devon, as alighting, he was received by Dame Cresset with one of her lowest courtesies. “Yes, my lord, at your service.” He then handed out his countess, and both entered the humble inn, to the great surprise and curiosity of the over-looking neighborhood. They were shown into the “best” parlor by the hostess, who hastened to dust seats for them. The captain stood, respectfully, in the door. “There is an advertisement in the Times that refers persons to this inn,” said the earl. “Will you be so kind as to inform me who wrote it?” “It was written by me, my lord; if, as I imagine, I address a noble lord.” “I am the Earl of Devon, and this the Countess, sir,” said the nobleman, bowing with deference to the captain's military air and buttons. “Then there could not, my lord and lady, have been more welcome visitors. I was just making up my mind to go down into the north to call on you.” “In reference to the silver cup?” asked the countess. “Yes, my lady. I ascertained that the cup was purchased by a Lady Devon.” “Yes, by me!” “We can also, sir, inform you, that the `Exeter Castle' sailed from the Tyne, and was two days afterwards wrecked on the coast of England, not far from `The Wash.' We were on board, and were saved only by the miraculous power of God. But what of this cup you advertise?” “My lord, may I ask if you have a son?” “No—he was lost—lost at the time—a child, nearly six years old,” answered the nobleman, sadly. “Do you know this cup?” asked the captain, placing it in his hand. “I do not recognize it; but the number—” “I know it!” exclaimed the countess, catching it, and pressing it to her lips. I know it well by this indentation of his three teeth. Well do I know it, and clearly remember when it was done by our lost boy. It is the cup he had with him at the time of the wreck.” “Even if the teeth-prints were not evidence, the number is,” said the captain. “Yes, without question, that is the cup we purchased!” “And the cup that was on board the `Exeter Castle' when she was wrecked?” inquired, or rather asserted, the captain. “Yes—the same! But what object have you in adv—” “Your lordship shall hear,” said the hostess, who took the deepest interest in what passed. “I will tell your ladyship. About six weeks ago, a tall, handsome youth, with black hair and dark, fine eyes, and gentle spoken, came from the country and lodged here. I was so taken to him—he was so good looking and kind—that I treated him more like my own! He told me all about himself; how he was reared a fisherman on the coast of Lincolnshire, but that he was not born one, but had been taken from a wreck when very young. He said his name was Philip, and that it had been given to him by the fisherman who had rescued him, and brought him up. He told me how he had loved, humble as he was, a little noble-born blind maiden, younger than he, and that it was out of love for her he came up to London, to try to find some surgeon skilled enough to give her sight. He said he was the occasion of her losing her sight, by means of an arrow! Wait a moment, dear lady, I will soon be at the end!” said Dame Cresset, seeing the eager air and clasped hands of the countess, as she drank in every word with a throbbing heart. “This young man went out the next day, and was kidnapped by a press-gang, and taken on board a frigate, which has sailed for the seas.” “What more? What has this story to do—” gasped the countess, whose hopes and fears were struggling together. “In his knapsack I found a silver cup—” “This?” “The same, my lady—and a compass. These, he said, were on the wreck with him, and he told me that he had brought them with him to London, hoping to learn something by them about the ship, and those who sailed in it.” “I have ascertained,” said the captain, “that the compass was sold by Kerr &amp; Kerr to the ship `Exeter Castle,' a dozen or more years ago.” “And that the cup, with this number on it, was bought by Lady Devon?” asked the earl, rapidly. “Yes, my lord.” There was a moment's silence; the silence of astonishment, of hope, of emotion. The countess first spoke in a voice trembling with joy: “Without doubt, this is our child!” “Let us not raise our hopes too high, dear Mary,” said the earl, trying to conceal his own feelings. “It is possible that this cup may have been saved, and yet the child not be our own!” “There was no other boy on board but him!” “True, I recollect none! We will, at least, hope—” “I am sure—” “My lady, here is a little old book, which he said was found in his pocket by the fisherman.” “My own prayer book!” shrieked the countess. “It is our own child! It is Henry who was saved! It is Henry who has been here in this house! O, my son! my son! Has God given thee back to me out of the jaws of death?” “Be calm, my dear wife!” said the earl, tenderly embracing her. “Do not say you doubt! Confirm my joy! See! read this part of his whole name: `Cla' `lia,'—`For Henry Clarence William.' It is our own writing!” “And there are our arms!” said the earl. “I am now convinced that our dear boy is yet alive!” “But where?” cried the countess, whose newborn joy was nearly stifled by fear. “You say, sir, that the young man—Heaven grant that he prove to be our son, and that we may yet behold him; you say that he was pressed on board one of his majesty's frigates?” “Yes, my lord.” “Proof of it, have you?” “Yes, by a man who was pressed at the same time and escaped, and brought a note to the good hostess here.” “O, let me see my child's writing!” cried the countess. “He writes well—even at such a time,” said the earl, with satisfaction. “He is well schooled, your ladyship. He uses language like a lord, saving your presence. You need not feel ashamed of him, if he was brought up by a fisherman.” “Ashamed! You are not a mother, good woman, to think I could be ashamed to receive my son to my arms in rags!” In the meanwhile, the earl learned from the happy captain, who began to imagine himself already the husband of the landlady of “The Arrow,” that the waterman was out making inquiries about the frigate. “If he can ascertain her name, all the rest is easy,” said the earl, speaking with the confidence of one who has influence and power at his command. While he was speaking, Bolton entered, and looking not a little surprised at finding such noble company; for in that day, noblemen were distinguished from other men by the richness and style of their dress. “Here is the man, now, my lord,” said the captain, turning to the waterman, whose appearance a week's good fare in the inn had much improved. “What news now? I hope more success than the last few days.” “Yes. The frigate was the `Bucephalus.' I heard another name first, but after close inquiry I made certain.” Lord Devon took down the name upon his tablets. “Now, my good friends—you, excellent captain, and you, worthy hostess—how can we reward you for being the authors of so much happiness to us in prospect? To you, if we indeed receive our child, we shall owe his restoration, through your wise steps taken in advertising the facts. Be assured, you will neither of you lose your reward.” “My reward, my lady and my lord,” said Dame Cresset, “will be to see Philip folded in your arms as your own son!” “And mine, my lord, will be to have you honor my marriage with your presence here, for I have my full reward in the hand of fair Dame Cresset, who promised if I could get intelligence of—” “My lord, don't listen to him,” said the dame, coloring, yet looking pleased; “he has done nothing at all as he promised. The waterman, here, brought the news of his being pressed; and your lordship came without his knowledge!” “But, did I not write the advertisement? Was I not going up into Lincoln—” “Ah, the captain is winner, fair dame! If we find our son, our happiness will not be complete until we see you both made happy by marriage.” “Thanks, my lord! With such a friend as your lordship, I shall not fail to be the happy man you wish me.” What pen can portray the joy and hope trembling in the heart of the countess, as she left the inn, though not without warmly pressing the hands of the hostess. “You took an interest in him! Your regard for him has brought him to our knowledge.” “When you hear from the frigate, please your ladyship, let us hear,” said the hostess. “Without fail!” “Yes, captain,” said the earl, in conversation with this person at the door, “it is to the Admiralty I shall at once go. Will you take a seat with me in my coach?” The captain readily complied, promising to report to the hostess all he should ascertain about the ship-of-war. The earl's coach drew up in due time at the gate of the office of the Admiralty. The nobleman's high rank obtained him admittance without delay. Accompanied by the captain—for he had dropped the countess at his hotel on the way,—he entered the apartment where one of the high dignitaries, who direct the destinies of the British navy, was surrounded by his secretaries and clerks. Lord Devon was received with a hearty shake of the hand by the Lord of the Admiralty, as if well known to him. “You are welcome to London, my lord!” “I have come a little earlier than usual. But I have reason to believe that a person, in whom I am deeply interested, has been pressed on board one of his majesty's ships of-war.” “Ah! that matter can be easily fixed.” “But I do not know what frigate it is.” “Then it will be difficult to—” “It was, however, a frigate—yes—I forgot—I have her name on my tablets. It is the `Bucephalus.”' “Captain Lord Berkeley.” “Can you inform me where she has sailed?” “I will ascertain for you, unless she went under sealed orders.” “Even in that case the seal, I trust, will be removed for me,” said the earl. “Your lordship appears very earnest about the poor man.” “It may be so; I have good reason, which I may, by-and-by, make known.” The Lord of Admiralty having beckoned to a page, gave him a message, written with pencil. He soon returned, with a secretary, from an inner room. “Pray, to what place is the `Bucephalus' sent?” “To the Mediterranean, my lord. But as she has on board Lord Monteagle and suite, for Madrid, she will stop at Cadiz.” “How long since she sailed?” inquired the earl, earnestly. “Thirty-eight days since she left Portsmouth.” “She must now be near Malta,” remarked the Lord of the Admiralty to the earl. “My lord, you will confer on me the highest personal favor by giving me the authority to place in the hands of Captain Manners, for the discharge of a youth of eighteen, named Philip, who was pressed in London the evening before the frigate left the river.” “It is but a slight favor to grant you, my lord. The order shall be at once made out; and if you wish, forwarded by our next despatch.” “I would rather take it with me,” said the earl. The order was soon written, and duly signed and sealed, and given to Lord Devon; for power and rank command where the poor and humble despair. It must ever be that, “to them that have shall be given; and from them that have not shall be taken away even that which he hath.” The captain was amazed at the facility with which the whole affair had been achieved, and marvelled at the potency of a great name. We will now leave London and its scenes, and follow the “Bucephalus” in her track across the waters. The ship had been at sea eleven days, and was in a far southern latitude, towards Spain, when, one morning, Captain Manners sent for Philip to come into his cabin. The captive had been too ill until then to appear on deck; for, what with his wound and the motion of the vessel, he could not hold up his head, and was compelled to keep below. But he had not been upon the deck ten minutes, when the Countess of Monteagle's eyes accidentally fell upon him as he was leaning over a gun, and looking pale and sick at heart. “My lord, do you see that face?” she said to the earl. “Yes; it is pale and sad! Poor youth, he seems ill!” “Is it unknown to you?” “Now I recognize him! Is it the shell-gatherer, Philip?” “So it strikes me! It must be he!” “How came he here? It may not be! Manners! what youth have you there? He, who is looking out of the port, with his eyes towards England, and doubtless thinking of home!” “I do not know—but I know that face! It is the victor of the golden arrow!” “You are right! None else can it be!” said the countess, with animation. “But how came he here?” asked the earl. “I will soon ascertain,” answered the captain, as he entered his state-cabin. The page obeyed his command, and to his surprise and joy, Philip found himself standing in the presence of the earl and countess—two tried friends; and he, also, next recognized the captain, whom he had seen but once, on the archery ground. The kind welcome he received from the noble pair, moved his generous heart, and tears stood in his eyes— tears of joy and gratitude. “And how came you on board here?” demanded the captain, after witnessing the interest taken in him by his sister and the earl. “I was pressed, sir.” “In London or Portsmouth?” “In London. I had only been there one day, when I was seized and brought on board. This wound from a cutlass has prevented me from doing duty. I am happy to know that I am among friends.” “This pressing men is so cruel,” said the countess, “it—” “We know it, sister,” interrupted the captain, with a smile. “But the service must have men. As for this young man, if you desire it, he is free.” Two days afterwards, the frigate reached Cadiz. Philip, at the request of the countess, was also landed there, and thence took a Spanish ship to return to London. CHAPTER XI. The story now leaps over three years from the conclusion of the last chapter. The scene and the country change. It is at the close of a delicious tropical day, and in the palm shaded court of a Moorish palace that the thread of the narrative is resumed. A Moorish prince is seated upon his divan surrounded by his guards, and glittering with all the splendors of his rank. Before him stands a venerable man, wita a beard like snow in whiteness descending to his breast. He wore a close fitting cap or fez, of red cloth, and a long black robe girdled at the waist with a green silk sash, the sacred color of his faith. His chain bound hands were folded upon his breast, and he seemed to be awaiting the judgment of the pacha. No eye was turned upon him with commiseration or feeling save those of a handsome male slave, who stood at prince's right hand, his cup-bearer. His gentle, dark eyes were fixed upon the old man with sorrow, strangely contrasting the appearance of his haughty master's. “So, Selim,” said the pacha, speaking to him as to a favorite, “so thou hast pity on this vile charlatan by thy looks!” “I reverence, my lord prince, his venerable air and his benign aspect. I hope he has done nothing worthy of death that he is brought before my lord this morning,” “Thou shalt know,” answered the prince, with a slight smile passing over his dark features. “Speak, dervish, what is thy crime?” “May it please your highness,” answered the old man, “I could not heal the disease of the princess, thy favored wife.” “This is not all! This were not a crime, caitiff; hadst thou not professed to be a healer of discases, and pretendedst to powers medicinal that would restore her, without the discase leaving a mark! But lo, her face is not only pitted with the vile plague, but she is threatened with blindness. By Allah, she scarce knew when the sun rose to-day!” “The physician can only use remedies: the result is in the hands of Heaven,” answered the old man, calmly. “Thou art worthy of death! Let thy skill restore thy head to thy shoulders, when it shall fall soon at thy feet!” “Mercy, my lord prince! If your highness will spare my aged head—for old men cling most closely to life—I will prepare thee a cosmetic that will, not without pain, but will effectually remove all trace of the disease from the princess's skin, and—” “Doubtless restore her sight,” interrupted the pacha, mockingly. “Go to! Thou art an impostor!” 5 “Nay, my lord, but this I will do!” “What, restore her sight?” demanded the pacha with incredulous surprise. “No—but her complexion by my cosmetic!” “Without eyes she will never know whether she be fair or blemished, old man! Thy want of skill has deprived her of her sight, and daily her soul is being sealed up in darkness. She knows me now only by my voice and step. Thou shalt die! Commend thy soul to the Prophet's keeping, for thou hast not another five minutes to live!” “If my lord will have mercy and spare his servant, I will tell my lord of a great physician in the city of Algiers, who has power even to restore sight! He will come to thee if thou wilt send me for him!” “Thou seekest but excuse to prolong thy miserable existence, old man! Thou hopest to escape in the desert on the way! Let his head be taken off! We have other matters to judge this morning.” The captain of the guard, at the signal of a raised finger by his master, stepped forward with a drawn sword, and was in the act of swinging it round to sever the head of the unsuccessful oriental chirurgeon, when the page Selim impulsively sprang towards him, and catching him by the arm, held it firmly, while he turned his face imploringly towards the pacha. “Spare him! oh, spare him, my noble master!” “And why dost thou care for him, Selim?” “He may know a man who can help the princess; and, if he perish, this knowledge perishes with him! Spare his life, my good lord! Thou canst always have him in thy power to do with him as thou wilt. A few days will make no great matter, that thou shouldst not grant it!” “It is granted—but not for him—but to thee, Selim. Sheathe thy scimitar, captain.” The young man bent his knee, gratefully, before the prince, and kissed his hand. “Art thou not of kin to this old man, Selim?” asked the prince. “Nay—I never saw him until he came to the palace a few days ago to heal the princess.” “Thou owest thy life to this youth,” said the pacha to the old man, whose looks expressed his joy at his escape from present death, and his gratitude to the young man, slave as he was, who had such influence as to save his head. “Now, what is the name of this man in Algiers, whom thou sayest can restore sight to the blind?” “He is, my lord, a great alchymist and astrologer; and by his wisdom he has found out many secrets important to man's happiness. One of these is, the restoration to sight of those who have once seen and lost it.” “Sayest thou he gives new eyes, man?” asked the prince, incredulously, with a look of contempt. “No, my lord prince; but if the eye remain untouched, the sight can be recovered by means of his art and skill.” “Doubtless equal to thy own, dotard!” “My lord, may his skill be tested?” asked the page, earnestly. “This wise man of Algiers shall be sent for, old man; but thou goest not for him thyself. I will have thy head within reach of my lieutenant's good blade! What is his name?” “Aldebrac, my lord pacha.” “The Arabian magician! I have heard of his fame. Sayest thou he dwellest in Algiers?” “I left him there, your highness, no less than four weeks ago. He will be found there yet—for he casteth the horoscope of the Royal House at Algiers, and it will take two moons yet to complete the year's circle, ten months of which he has been at work.” “He must come at our bidding.” “If I went, my lord, and saw him—and—” “You go not! You leave not Morocco, old man! I will take good care you escape not your deserts, if the magician come not up to your praise of him. Selim?” “My good lord,” answered the handsome page, who had manifested by his countenance the deepest interest in all that passed. “I shall despatch you on this errand to Algiers.” “Yes, your highness, I will gladly go.” “You will start an hour before sun-down, taking the cool of the day, and ride all night. An officer, with a guard of sixty horse shall escort you. In five days you will reach Algiers! You will bring the magician with you! I will give you a letter to the pacha, who will send him at my request. Delay not to return. By the twelfth day hence I shall expect to see you return.” The young man bowed low in sign of obedience, while his dark eyes betrayed a secret joy at heart. “By the beard of the Prophet, Selim, thou carest more for the princess, thy mistress, than I believed,” said the pacha, whose quick glance nothing escaped. “She has always been gentle and good to me, my lord.” “And, by Allah! have I not?” “Too kind, my lord! Only—” “Only — what? What femains behind unsaid?” “Only, my lord, that thou withholdest my freedom.” “Thou art the pearl of my eye, Selim! I could not live without thee! Thou hast more wisdom, and judgment, and devotion in thee than all my other slaves put together.” “These qualities, my prince, if they exist, ought surely to give me a title to the record of freedom rather than seal more firmly my bondage.” “Callest thou thy condition bondage, Selim?” said the prince, smiling, and looking pleasantly upon his page. “Have I not made thee, though thou hast not yet seen more than twenty-one years, my companion and confidant?” “True, my lord—but—” “If thou wilt bring this magician with thee, and he restore sight to the princess Fatima, I will restore thee thy freedom!” “In twelve days, your highness, the astrologer shall stand before you, if he be alive,” answered Selim with animation, his eyes sparkling with joy. “Go, old man! Guard him safely, but give him leave to walk in the out courts of the palace.” With this command to the officers of his guard, the prince moved his hand for their departure. Other matters were brought before him for judgment; but Selim immediately left the presence of the prince, to prepare for his departure. A few hours later in the day the princess Fatima was seated in her apartment, with the lattice open towards the gate of the city. By her side was the young pacha, her idolizing husband. “Nay, tell me not, fair wife, you cannot see that party of horsemen passing?” he said sorrowfully, and almost as it were reproachfully. “I perceive a moving mist—nothing more!” “It is the party with Selim, who goes to Algiers to bring hither the astrologer Aldebrac, to try his skill upon thine eyes!” “Nay, my lord! If my beauty be gone—I wish not sight to see my ugliness.” “But this chirurgeon sweareth by the Prophet he can prepare a cosmetic which will give thee a child's skin for fairness and smoothness. I have set him to his task. He promises in three days to have it prepared. If he fail, goes his head, and his carcase to the dogs!” “Seest thou not the palm tree waving above us?” “Only a shadow moving in a deep night!” The pacha gazed sadly down upon her and sighed; and turning sorrowfully away followed with his eyes the party of horse as it trotted out of the gate of the city and took its way across the sandy plain. At its head rode the noble looking page. He was armed like a warrior; and his manly mustache and bright, black eyes, and tall figure, were in harmony with his soldierly apparelling. On the morning of the fifth day, as the dawn broke, they came in sight of the Mediterranean and of the walls and towering mosques of the city of their destination, laying in the morning light between them and the shining sea. They arrived at the gate as the sun gilded its minarets, and Selim presenting his order from the Prince of Morocco, was received by the captain of the walls with great honor, and escorted to the palace of the bey. After the first receptions and salutations were over, the Bey, reading the letter of the prince, courteously signified his willingness to send him the magician. “Call him into our presence,” he commanded his attendant. “It is a sad calamity, the loss of eyes to the wife of our princely friend of Morocco,” he added, turning to Selim, whose noble air and rich costume attracted his attention.— But if there be skill in man to aid her, it is in the hand of the great astrologer. Art thou a slave?” he suddenly asked. “I am, your highness,” answered the page. “A Christian slave.” “Of what nation—Greece or Ispania?” Before a reply could be made, a slave entered and said: “The mighty magician sends word to your highness that he may not leave his calculations until the ninth hour of the day.” “We must submit to the stars,” said the bey. “I will send thee to him in his tower where he casteth his horoscopes. He at least can see thee there and know thy message. Return hither when thou hast spoken with him thy prince's word.” Selim being conducted across the court of the palace, came to a terrace, which he ascended, following his conductor to a tower. Up the stairs of this he wound his way, and entered a small upper room, where sat the astrologer, surrounded by strange instruments and telescopes, and all the paraphernalia of a magician's occult profession. He was a tall, dark man, with a long black beard and gray hair profusely covering his shoulders. He wore a blue gown and a green turban. The lines of his face were deep, and marked advanced age; his features were strongly cast and expressive of intelligence; his air was haughty and his look imperative. He raised his piercing eyes from a piece of parchment on which he was making calculations, and seeing Selim enter, he said sternly to the attendant: “Said I not I must be undisturbed?” “My lord,” said Selim, calmly, “I am come on business most urgent, and time is precious, each moment!” “Speak! what wouldst thou?” “I am the page of the Emperor of Morocco. His fair bride was taken ill with the small pox. A physician offered to cure her without leaving a scar, but failed—and—” “Who was he?” “Abdel of Fez.” “I know him—he has great skill! But diseases are in the hands of Allah! Men are not infallible.” “My master would have slain him, but he spoke of you.” “I can do nothing. If her beauty is impaired, let her use cosmetics,—those Abdel prepares,— not I!” “So he promises to do. But, my lord, the empress is blind! The fell disease destroyed her sight,” added the page, with extraordinary emotion. When the sword was hanging over his head, he said if the prince would spare his life he would send him one who could give her back her vision. He named you. His life depends on my success in taking you to Morocco and your skill there! Speak, my lord! Can you restore sight to the blind?” he added, with an earnestness that made the magician fix upon him his penetrating look with surprise. “If the eye be not broken. I have learned the skill to restore an uninjured eye; but I obtained it with a life's toil and great treasure expended. I found the art in India!” “Then thou canst restore the sight of the empress?” “Not until I see her, can I answer thee!” “Thou must go with me. It is the command of the bey.” “I yield obedience. To-morrow I will start with thee. To-night I must watch a certain occulation.” “The emperor, my master, will well reward thee!” said the page, with trembling joy and hope. “Thou lovest her well, young man.” “She is kind, my lord. She was very fair before this happened. It would make her so happy; and also the prince.” “To-morrow, at early dawn, I will depart with thee. So I return by the beginning of the circle of the next coming month, as it enters the zodiac, I shall not mar my horoscopes! At the end of the year I depart for Gibraltar, a while to be present to watch the eclipse of one of Jupiter's moons. The motions of the heavens are our volumes, where we read written the destinies of the princes of the earth.” It was moonlight when the escort of horse, which had twelve days before left Morocco, reentered the city, and took its weary, slow, and dusty way toward the palace. When the prince heard of Selim's return, he sent for him to come immediately into his presence. “Welcome! Hast thou succeeded?” “Aldebrac, the magician, is within the palace,” answered Selim, with an air of triumph. “What says he? Can he restore sight?” “He will give no answer, my prince, until he beholds the royal patient,” he has said. “Wisely forborne! To-morrow he shall see her. To-night have him well taken care of. But I did not tell thee, Selim, that the cosmetic of Abdel promiseth to do all he said it would. This is the ninth day that it has been applied, and already Fatima has begun to recover her beauty.” “May the magician, my lord, be as successful in restoring her to sight.” “Allah grant it!” The next day the astrologer was sent for, to the presence of the empress. The prince was with her, and Selim stood near. “Art thou, then, the great magician, Aldebrac, of whom fame speaks?” asked the prince, as he bowed himself before him with stately courtesy. “I am Aldebrac, your highness's servant.” “Hast thou skill to restore sight to the blind?” “If not born blind, my lord prince, and if the eye be not marred in appearance.” “Here, then, is a case that will test thy skill, sir magician. Behold this royal lady, the sharer of my throne as of my heart. Her eyes seem, as thou seest, without injury; but within the last three days total blindness has sealed their vision. If thou canst give her back her sight, I will pay thee thine own weight in silver bars.” “My lord prince, I will see what my skill can do,” answered the magician. He then drew near, and looked steadily into the eyes of the empress. Selim watched him, if possible, with more eagerness than the prince himself. Bringing her eyes broadly to the full sunlight, he several times pressed and closed the lids, and then suddenly removed his thumb and fingers, and asked her what colors she saw?” “Blue and orange,” she answered. “And when I press my hands upon the eyes?” “Glittering stars!” “Thy sight can be restored to thee?” answered the magician, confidently. “But thou must bear a moment's pain! It will be like fire.” “So I see once more my husband's face, I will bear whatever pain may be necessary.” “Sir astrologer,” said the monarch, warningly, “if you operate upon her eyes to injure their appearance, or fail to restore her sight—” “My head answers for it!” he interrupted. “I know it; but I fear not the issue! In a few minutes she shall behold your highness's face!” The magician then drew from a pocket beneath his black robe, a small casket. Opening it, he took from it two crystal bottles. One contained a crimson oil, the other a transparent fluid. He opened both, and desired the empress to lay her head back and open fully the eyes. He was about to pour from the red vial into them, when the emperor said, sternly: “Beware! See that thou doest no evil; for thy life shall presently answer it.” “I know my art, your highness.” “I have confidence, my lord!” said the empress, and she placed her head back upon the side of the ottoman; but the emperor removing it, held it, while he fixed his fiery eyes upon the magician. The latter calmly, and with a steady hand, poured from the red vial into both eyes an oily liquid, which overrun them. “There is no pain,” she said. “Were it not for this oil thou couldst not endure what I am now to pour into thine eyes,” said the astrologer. “Be firm, and move not!” “Guard well what thou art doing!” warned the prince. Without regarding his words, the magician dropped slowly, drop by drop, the colorless liquid upon the pupil of the eye. The empress slightly screamed, and grew deadly pale. But the operator immediately closed her eyes with his fingers, and held them firmly for a moment. He then took a silken bandage, and bound it tightly over them. “The pain was intense; but I can bear it now,” said the empress to her husband's inquiries. Selim had watched the process as eagerly and with as breathless interest, as if she had been his sister. The astrologer held the handage upon her eyes about five minutes, and then removing it, bade her open her eyes. As she did so, he poured into them an amber-colored fluid, and after a moment called for water to bathe them. After a free application of the water, the empress was permitted by him to look about her, and say if she saw ought. “I see—I see you, my dear husband!” she almost shrieked, and fell weeping with joy upon his shoulders. By direction of the magician, she was to be kept in a deeply-shaded room for a day or two. The result was, that on the third day, she saw perfectly, and her eyes appeared as if they had never been dimmed. The old physician, Abdel, was released from his captivity, and rewarded with a purse of gold for naming Aldebrac to the emperor; and the magician himself received his own weight in silver, duly weighed, out of the royal treasury, and which took two camels to convey to Algiers. But when Selim bent his knee before his royal master, and craved the fulfilment of his promise, to give him his freedom, if the empress were restored to sight, the prince looked sorrowful. “If thou wilt take thy freedom and yet remain with me in Morocco, I will make thee my chief vizier, confer upon thee my second palace, place at thy disposal a body guard, bestow upon thee fourscore slaves, and thou shalt have thy choice of the fairest maids of my realm for wives! Gold and silver shall be thine without measure; and only in the throne shall I be greater than thou!” “My noble master and prince,” answered Selim, “these proofs of thy favor deeply touch me. But I ask no more of thee than my freedom; and leave to return to my century.” “Thou sayest thou hast no father nor mother; nay, that thou knowest not surely thy country! But my words make thee sad! I will keep my promise. Rise from thy knees! Thou art from this moment free!” Selim, with tears in his eyes, rose and kissed his hand. The emperor then presented him with many suits of raiment, and a heavy purse of gold, and said: “Whither wilt thou go?” “To the nearest European port, my prince.” “I send a ship in four days to Gibraltar, with bales of camels' hair and dates. Thou mayest go in her if thou hast made up thy mind to leave me.” Early on the night following this interview with the prince, Selim left the palace, and secretly took his way towards the quarter of the city where the magician had taken lodgings, in order to be ready to leave the gates at midnight, on his return to Algiers; for in the hot desert of that torrid clime, travellers venture not forth upon the road by day, but sleep in the shade, moving only by night. The astrologer had taken leave of the emperor before night, and not only received his rich reward in silver ingots, but the gratified empress placed upon his hand a diamond of great value, in token of her appreciation of his services. Selim made his way through the horsemen of the escort that was to accompany the magician back to Algiers, who were in groups about the house where he dwelt, some in the saddle, others making ready their harness, others asleep. He found the great Aldebrac alone in his room. He was engaged in watching the stars through his window, and was muttering to himself his calculations. Upon seeing Selim enter, he said, with a look of pleasure: “Welcome, page! Thou hast come, I trust, to say thou hast changed thy mind, and will escort me back; for I like well thy company; and thy conversation betokens a mind above thy years. Go with me, and I will teach thee to read the stars, and foretell the events that are to happen on earth!” “Mighty Aldebrac,” answered Selim, with reverence, “I respect thy skill in reading the stars; but I would rather possess ten drops of the fluid in the three vials thou openedst to restore sight to the princess, than all the stars of heaven—were each a burning ruby!” The astrologer fixed his star-penetrating gaze upon his eyes, as if they would penetrate to the very depths of his soul, and said, gravely: “Young man, thou knowest not what thou speakest. Man and God behold the stars at the same instant! They are the link that unites the Creator with his lower universe!” “I love to gaze upon them, and from them let my thoughts ascend to Him who hung them in the skies. I shall revere them no less to possess the boon I ask of thee! All my riches, with which the emperor has loaded me, I will give to purchase of thee a few drops from each vial!” “Nay—I love thee! Thou shalt have what thou desirest, as a gift of my regard for thee. On my journey hither, thou hast won my heart.” “O, wilt thou, indeed, bestow this treasure upon me?” cried Selim, with emotion between doubt and hope. “Thou shalt have what thou askest of me; but on one condition.” “Name it, my lord.” “That you return with me to Algiers! From thence thou mayst sail for Spain. I will then accompany thee to the Gibraltero of the Infidels, once the rock of our fathers' dominion. I go to restore sight to a Giaour maiden of high degree; for my fame has reached even Ispania!” “It shall fill the world if thou bestowest on me my desire!” answered Selim. “What wouldst thou do with it? But hark! the bugle of the escort sounds! I must soon be upon my camel. Wilt thou go with me, instead of taking this vessel that may be more weeks a sea than we shall be days?” “If it is the only condition—” “I make it the condition of granting thy wish, for thy good company's sake,” answered the magician, with a smile. In an hour afterwards, the whole cavalcade, with its guarded treasure, with Aldebrac, and Selim riding at his side, left the city by starlight, and took the way across the desert, northwardly, guided in their course by the polar star. CHAPTER XII. The scenes of this story are now once more transferred to Castle Monteagle. Three years have passed since our hero, Philip, whom we trust the reader has not quite forgotten, left there to go to London. We have seen how he was pressed into the service of the king, on board the “Bucephalus;” and that, through the recognition of him by the Earl and Countess of Monteagle, who were on board, passengers for Cadiz, he was released from duty on board, and permitted to return from that port to England at his pleasure. We have also seen how, after his forcible departure from London, by the means of the advertisement of the half-pay captain, it was clearly shown that he was the long lost son of the Earl and Countess of Devon. We have seen them acknowledge the consanguinity from evidence not disputed by them, and how, at the request of the nobleman, his father, the Admiralty instructed the captain, Lord Manners, to give him his liberty, and send him at the crown's cost, on his way back to England. The order from the Admiralty reached Cadiz in due time; but the “Bucephalus” had already resumed her voyage to Malta, having left at Cadiz not only the Earl and Countess of Monteagle, but, as was reported to the Admiralty, “the pressed seaman, Philip.” The report fur ther stated that he had embarked, soon after the departure of the “Bucephalus,” from which he was discharged, in a Spanish ship for London, there being no English vessel immediately sailing. This intelligence being received at the Admiralty was duly made known to the Earl of Devon. With anxious hope, and with hearts yearning to embrace their long lost and now recovered son, the noble pair awaited the arrival of the “Carlos V.,” the name of the vessel in which Philip was said to have taken his return passage for England. Twenty—thirty—thirty five days passed, and yet she arrived not. Daily the earl visited the Exchange, and examined the list of vessels in from sea. Thence he invariably stopped at the “Arrow Inn,” to ask there if the captain, or Bolton the waterman, had, by chance, got any intelligence. The distinctions of rank seemed to be quite set aside when the heart was interested; and the countess would often spend an hour at the inn, talking with Dame Cresset about her son, and making her, over and over, describe his dress, his look, his eyes, the color of his hair, his mouth, his smile, his tone of voice, his step, his hands! and good Dame Cresset was never weary of the subject. The earl, at the same time, would hold discourse with the captain, and wonder at the detention; they would bring up all the instances of protracted passages they could hear of; but these comforted the earl but little; for three ships from Cadiz had already arrived that left a fortnight or eighteen days after the “Carlos V.” “We have only recovered our son to lose him again, unseen and unembraced!” said the countess, one day, after hope, long deferred, had made her heart sick. “There yet is hope, dear lady,” said the kind hostess. “None! It is now fifty-four days. The `Bucephalus' is already returning from Malta! The earl has learned that there was a great storm the day after the `Carlos' left Cadiz; and without doubt the ship was wrecked on the coast of Spain, or of Portugal, and Henry perished!” “Take heart, take heart, dear lady!” said the widow, whose own heart now sank within her; “Providence would not snatch him from the sea twelve years ago, and give you knowledge of his being alive, to cause him to perish before you see him.” But time passed on. Months elapsed, and, with total absence of all tidings of the ship, died all hopes in the bosoms of the noble earl and countess of embracing on earth their lost son—now twice lost to them! At length three years passed by, and they had not ceased to mourn him whom they had once more assigned to a grave beneath the sea. About this time, the Earl of Monteagle, who for three years had faithfully served the crown at Madrid, as minister to the Spanish court, returned on a visit of a few weeks to his estates. This visit had been rendered imperative by the fall in battle, with a French frigate, of the brave brother of the countess—Captain Lord Manners. Lady Berkely Manners, his widow, yielding to her grief at his loss, was rapidly going into a decline. “We must return for a time,” said the earl, on hearing this news at Madrid. “Our dear child, Agnes, must now be ever with us, since her unfortunate blindness is to be for life.” The evening after the return of Lord and Lady Monteagle to their castle, the Lady Manners was laid in the tomb beneath the chancel of the village church. “You must now return to Spain with us, dear Agnes,” said the Conntess Eleanora, as they were seated in the castle, at the lattice of which three years before, Radnor Catheart had stood and observed the maiden write the name “Philip” on the air with the point of the gold en arrow; and at which Philip, a few days afterwards had taken leave of her, to go up to London. “And you have no doubt, my more than mother, that I am the daughter of Lord Robert Clan-William?” after some silent thought, asked Agnes, now in her nineteenth year, and, if possible, more beautiful than ever. Her blindness had lent a pensive cast to her sweet face, and given a spiritual and soul-inward look to her soft eyes. She appeared like an angel, who is compelled to dwell for a time on earth, but is ever thinking of the heaven whence she came. “The necklace which Alice found upon your neck, and which my brother, Lord Manners, took up to London, has been recognized at the Herald's Office, where he left it before going to sea. We heard yesterday that it was claimed by Lady Clan-William! And we look for her here every hour!” “To see me?” cried Agnes, with trembling lips, and turning pale. “But not to take her from me!” said Dame Alice, decidedly—the decision of firm affection. This faithful and true friend of Agnes had for three years watched over her “daughter of the sea,” as she termed her, and was now present, looking no longer wild and weird-like, but calm and affectionate. “If she takes her, you will not be left behind, Alice,” said the Countess of Monteagle. “And if Lady Clan-William be my mother?” “She is kind as well as noble. I know her intimately, Agnes. You will almost forget me, I fear, when you see her.” “See her? Would that I could see her, dear Lady Eleanora, if she be indeed my mother!” “Pardon me! I was careless in the word I used.” “And my father?—if she be my mother!” asked Agnes, with deep interest. The countess looked embarrassed, and then said: “He has been a great many years dead.” Alice started, and became deadly pale! She recollected where and how, fifteen years ago, she had hid him in the dungeon of the old tower on the cliff. She had not from that hour till the present thought of him! Her own danger and imminent peril of death had cast him quite out of her mind. “Dead? Lord Robin dead!” “Yes, Alice. He has been many years dead.” “In the—the—cavern—” The countess made a sign for her to be silent. She obeyed, but her looks betrayed her curiosity and deep interest in the interdicted subject. “He has been years dead,” added the countess; “but you will be a source of consolation to your mother, who has passed a life of sad and secluded widowhood.” At this moment the earl entered, and announced their expected guests to be in sight upon the road. The countess left Agnes, trembling with anxiety and nervous hope, to receive the noble widow of Lord Robin, whose terrible death in the tower the reader is already familiar with. The Lady Clan-William, upon an interview with the earl and countess on her arrival at the castle, showed them clearly that Agnes must be her daughter. She explained to them how that she had taken passage in a barque, at London, to go to her brother, a Scottish lord, near Inverness, after the treason and crime of her husband, Lord Robert; and that the vessel was wrecked off the tower, already known to the reader. She stated that she had been washed ashore some miles above the tower upon a piece of the ship, and that a fisherwoman rescued her, and entreated her with hospitality for several days; and that finally her son had conveyed her to the nearest town. Here she made known her desolate situation to her brother, who came for her, and took her to his home. “My child,” she added, “I gave up for lost. I mourned for it for years, and left not my brother's secluded home; for he was now my all, as my erring husband's estate had been confiscated to the crown. But a few weeks ago, my brother being in London, saw in the papers how that a costly necklace, found upon a female child, shipwrecked fifteen years ago, was deposited at the Herald's Office for recognition. On his return he described it to me, and said he believed that it once belonged to Agnes. I at once clung to the hope, hastened to London, and recognized the bracelet by her initials graven beneath the braided hair in the clasp. I am now here, dear Lady Monteagle, to see if in this young girl I can recognize my daughter.” She was soon ushered into the room where Agnes was seated, helplessly, as usual, in her arm-chair. Lady Olan-William gazed a moment upon the lovely face, each instant the light of maternal recoguition brightening her countenance. “Agnes! do you know your dear mothers, voice?” she suddenly called out, with much emotion. “Mother—O, my mother! my dear, dear mother!” cried Agnes, extending her hands, “I hear you—I know those tones! You are my own—my lost—my beloved mother!” In an instant they were folded in one another's arms, and so clung they together that it seemed they would mingle into one. Lady Monteagle wept, and Dame Alice let the tears trickle unheeded adown her wrinkled cheeks. A few days passed of such happiness as earth seldom bestows upon its children. The time at length arrived that the earl should return to his post at Madrid. Lady Clan-William consented to accompany them with Agnes, who now would not for a moment be separated from her newfound mother. The earl had insisted that Agnes ought to go to Spain, for he said he had heard there of the reputation of a great Arabian magician and alchymist, who had restored sight to the eyes of many blind persona. “It was our intention,” he said, to Lady Clan-William, “to have taken her back with us, that the skill of this person, who often comes into Spain from Barbary, may be tested in her case.” “Whatever holds out any hope for the recovery of her sight, must not be untried,” said her mother; and so it was decided that they should sail with them. Three weeks afterwards, the whole party were in London, waiting the sailing of their frigate. At the hotel where they lodged, the earl happily met his friend, Lord Devon, whom he had not seen for some years, and who was on the eve of embarking for a tour in the East. Dining together the following day, the latter alluded to the proposed voyage to Cadiz by the earl, and sorrowfully remarked: “We can never, Lady Devon and I, think of Cadiz without emotion. One dear to us, who embarked there for London three years ago, never reached England. He was lost at sea!” “May I ask of what friend you speak?” asked Lord Monteagle, with a look and tone of sympathy. “Of our son—our only son, Henry! The history of this dear boy is one full of painful interest. Twice lost to us—twice given up as dead!” Here, at the request of the earl and countess, and while Agnes, as well as Dame Alice, were listeners, Lord Devon recounted what the reader already knows of the narrative of Philip, up to the time of the expected return from Cudiz in the Spanish ship. This account was heard by the earl and countess, and not less so by Agnes, with the deepest surprise. And when the earl made known to Lord and Lady Devon what he knew of Philip, their amazement was unbounded; while their regret at his death was increased when they heard him spoken of with such praise by their noble friends. “You have no doubt,” said the earl, “of his being your son?” “None, my lord,” answered Lady Devon. “The silver cup—the prayer book found upon him, with our arms and my name, assure us! But, I should have known him without any hesitation had it pleased Heaven to give him back to us. Upon each arm he had tattooed a strange gipsey mark.” “What was it, my lady?” asked Dame Alice. “A crocodile on one wrist, and a fish on the other! The gipsies would often camp about our castle, and once we missed Henry for a whole day. When at length he was found in their encampment, his arms bore these signs, which they said were a charm for good luck. Being pricked in in Hindoo ink, they are indelible.” “He is without doubt your son, then,” said the earl; “for I noticed on his left arm, as he drew his arrow hard to the head on the archery ground, the crocodile. It struck me then as a singular device; but as seamen and fishermen often tattoo themselves, I did not think of it again. Now I distinctly recall it to mind!” “Too late! Our child is lost forever to us!” said the Countess of Devon, with deep emotion. We now change the scene of our tale to the fortress of Gibraltar. A month has elapsed, and the whole party, whom we left in London, are guests in the lordly mansion of the commander of the gigantic fortress. The next month, Lord and Lady Devon were to continue their voyage to Constantinople, while the earl and his family were to remain to test the skill of the famed Arabian magician, who, to the nobleman's great gratification, he learned was in Algiers. Thither he at once sent to invite him, with offers of a large sum, to visit Gibraltar. We now return to Aldebrac and Selim. In due time they reached Algiers; and here the magician communicated to the page the secret of preparing the three fluids, and, at the same time, presented him, with great ceremony, three small vials. Selim was now all impatience to embark for Europe; and Aldebrac having received the earl's message, said he would depart the day after the year, then drawing to its close, completed the horoscopic cycle. At length the two took ship together, on board of a Portuguese trading vessel, that came to Algiers with tribute. The fifth day, thereafter, they anchored within the shadow of Gibraltar. It was night when Aldebrac reached the town from the vessel, accompanied by Selim. The latter followed him to an ancient quarter of the city, where dwelt chiefly Moors and Jews. After devious windings through narrow and dark streets, which seemed familiar to the astrologer's tread, he stopped before an old house, built in the Oriental style. Here he was welcomed by a bearded man, whose features betrayed his Moorish origin. The two men conversed long together, while Selim, fatigued, slept, clasping his precious vials to his breast; while his goat-skin bag, filled with gold and precious stones, lay carelessly near him. About midnight he was awaked by a deep, muttered cry and a heavy fall. Springing to his feet, he saw by the moonlight the astrologer lying bleeding upon the stone floor, and gasping with the suffocation of death. He attempted to raise him up, but the body fell back with the lifeless weight of clay. The spirit of the astrologer had flown beyond the stars. The soul of the magician had gone to the mysteries of another life! Selim was amazed at the suddenness of the catastrophe. He saw no one in the room, but he fancied he had caught sight of a dark form gliding from the spot as he awoke. Suspecting robbery as the cause of the murder, he felt for the old man's sack of diamonds and pearls, into which he had converted his wealth, and it had been torn from his neck. “The host has slain the guest for his gold!” said Selim. “I, also, must fly! But happy am I to have secured this great secret for restoring vision, before it perished with him forever.” The next day, the Earl of Monteagle, who had been for several days past sending to the abode to know if the Arabian magician had yet arrived, sent again! Selim, in the meanwhile, had sought other lodgings, and in the morning had given information to the authorities of the robbery and murder. When the earl's messenger arrived at the door, he found a press of people about it; and learning the fate of the astrologer, was about to hasten to the fortress to inform his master, when Selim, learning why he had come, said: “When thou seest thy master, say to him that though the astrologer is no more, he has an apprentice to his art, who has equal power to give sight to the blind. If he will send for me, I will come. Who is thy lord? Who is the patient?” But before the man could reply, a party of soldiers coming up, separated them. “I will, at least, do this lady good, for whose relief my poor master, Aldebrac, was sent for— if relief be possible. I will test the virtue of the vials on this lord of Gibraltar's daughter,—” “Wert thou not with the Moorish magician when he was slain?” suddenly demanded an officer at his side. “Yes, he was slain within reach of where I slept.” “Come with us—we need your testimony!” said the officer. It was late in the day before Selim was permitted to go by the examining judge. The assassin was proven to be the host, as on his person was found the bag of jewels. The jewels were given into Selim's possession, and the murderer conducted to prison. “Come with me, Sir Moor?” said a soldier, addressing him, as he left the hall of judgment. “My lord, the general and his guests wait thee!” Selim followed the man to the fortress; entering its massive gateway, he was led across a broad court, and into a stately residence, above which floated the crimson folds of the banner of the British Isles. It was an hour before sunset, and the golden radiance of his western light flooded a gorgeous banqueting room, where sat around a table, from which the feast had long since given place to a rich display of tropical fruits, the white-haired commander of the castle, Earl and the Countess of Monteagle, Lady Clan-William, Lord and Lady Devon, Agnes, and others. In the room were attendants, and good Dame Alice was not far from the side of her favorite “child of the sea.” “You say you read this news of Lord Cranstown's suicide in the Times?” asked the Earl of Monteagle, with a look of surprise, at an announcement by the commander of the castle. “Yes, my lord—by poison.” “I deeply regret this sad termination of the life of a young nobleman, who, but for his uncontrollable temper, might have conferred distinction upon his country.” Agnes seemed deeply touched by the intelligence, and they were still speaking of the unhappy event, when Selim was announced. His appearance was striking, and drew all eyes upon him. He was dressed in a magnificent Moorish costume, with a jewelled yatagan at his side. His figure was tall and noble in its commanding proportions, his manner dignified and graceful, his face dark, but exceedingly handsome, his finely-shaped mouth relieved by a brown mustache, and his jet black hair waved about his neck. There was a general interchange of glances of admiration among the noble persons present. “The apprentice of the magician, my lord,” announced the attendant at the door. Selim bowed with grace, and with a noble air. “Canst thou hold speech in English?” asked the commander. “If it please your excellency.” “This is well! For an Arab, you speak remarkably well,” suggested the old officer, looking around upon his guests. “It was a bad murder of thy master?” “He was old and defenceless, my lord.” “Dost thou profess to have his art and skill?” asked the Earl of Monteagle, while all eyes, but those of Agnes, were fixed earnestly upon him. “Not in all things, my lord. I have only one art, and that is to restore sight to the blind, if the eye be not marred.” “Thou speakest confidently, young man!” “Because I have confidence in my power! I have heard that there is here a maiden who is so unhappy as to have lost her sight. He who came at your command to restore it, is no more. His art lives with me. If you will permit me to behold the lady, I will say if it is in my power to benefit her by my skill.” “He speaks fair,” said the old officer. “Agnes,” said the earl, looking towards the lovely daughter of Lady Clan-William, “thou hearest! Will you consent?” “Do not tremble thus,” said the countess and her mother, going to her where she was seated in a recess of the window, shaking like the leaf of an aspen, and deadly pale. “What wilt thou do?” demanded the earl, without heeding this by-scene. “I will use only a liquid.” “I am calmer now,” said Agnes. “I was only overcome! I feel that I ought to let this young man try his skill. There is something in the sound of his voice that gives me a strange confidence in him!” “Behold thy patient!” said the earl, conducting Selim to where Agnes sat. The young Arab, in his turn, was now visibly under the influence of some sudden emotion. “He trembles!—he doubts! He must not be trusted!” said Lady Clan-William. At this moment he stood before Agnes. He had no sooner beheld her than a new agitation seemed to seize him. He started back!—he seemed about to fall! But recovering himself, he said, firmly: “My lord, I will cure her!” “Agnes, wilt thou consent?” asked Lady Devon. “He looks so noble and frank that I could trust my life in his hand.” “He shall try! I have full trust in him!” she answered, in a voice tremulous and liquid with some strange inward joy. The maiden, by Selim's order, placed her head between the hands of the Countess Monteagle. Her countenance was pale, but expressed firmness and trust. There was the most intense expectation visible on the faces of all present as Selim took from a pearl casket the three vials which the magician had given to him. His hand trembled—and the reader will begin by this time to perceive why— as he drew the golden stoppers. But when he took up the first vial, to pour into those beautiful but sightless eyes, that looked up to him like twin heavens from beneath, his hand became firm. The crimson oil overflowed the fair eyes, which seemed to be filled with blood to the sight of those who gazed on. He then took the vial of transparent fluid, and poured a drop upon each pupil, whispering: “Be firm and do not shrink. The pain will be severe; but only for a moment.” A slight moan escaped her. The next moment a third vial had been used, and her eyes were quickly bandaged. Scarcely had he tied the knot, when a loud shriek thrilled to every heart! Every eye turned to Lady Devon. She stood pointing to the bared arm of Selim, who had put back his sleeve in operating upon Agnes's eyes. “A crocodile!” exclaimed the Earl of Monteagle. “It is my son—my living, lost son!” cried Lady Devon, rushing towards him. “Stay! Let us question him!” said Lord Monteagle. “Young man, are you a Moor?” “No, my Lord Monteagle! I am an Englishman, I believe. I am surprised you did not recognize me, as soon as I did you! I am Philip, the shell-gatherer—who—” “Is it true! Thou art he!” cried the earl. “And my son!” shrieked Lady Devon. “Art thou he who, three years ago, left in London a silver cup, and was pressed on the `Bucephalus?”' demanded Lord Devon. “The same, my lord. I embarked from Cadiz, and was captured, with the ship I was in, by a Moorish cruiser, and made a slave to the Prince of Morocco. After three years service, he gave me, a few weeks ago, my freedom. I there obtained knowledge from the great magician, Aldebrac, of the art I have just now exercised upon the eyes of the Lady Agnes.” It would be impossible with pen and ink to portray the scene of joy and excitement that followed. Lord and Lady Devon clasped him in their two fold embrace, and recognized him as their long lost but recovered son. Who shall paint, also, his surprise and joy? All this while, Agnes was seated with bandaged eyes. Her ears heard all, and her heart bounded with the wildest joy. She had already half recognized the voice as Philip's, but believing him dead, the resemblance only touched her, and led to no suspicions of the truth; it only gave her confidence in one who spoke in a tone so much like his, whose image was dearest to her heart. “When will Agnes see?” asked Lady Monteagle, with tears of joy sparkling in her eyes at the happy scenes of recovery, recognition and re-union she had just passed through. “This moment, if she can see again,” answered, no longer Philip, no longer Selim, but Lord Henry Devon, with a voice full of his newly-awakened happiness. He approached her, removed the bandage, and bathing her eyes freely with water, as he had seen the astrologer do in the Moorish prince's palace, he removed the pressure of his fingers, and said: “Agnes—look about you!” “I see—I see you all! I behold your face dear, noble Philip! my deliverer! Heaven bless you forevermore!” Thus speaking with the outbursts of her feelings, she threw herself upon his breast, and the lovers mingled their tears of joy together! No one, for a moment, spoke! It was s scene too sacred and holy to be interrupted. The tale is done! It need not be told that they all returned to England a happy party; that the lovers were united at Monteagle castle; and that the half-pay captain won for his part of the spoils, the fair hand of the widow of “The Arrow.” THE END</field>

      <field name="fulltext">THE PHANTOM FRIAR. BY AUGUSTINE J. H. DUGANNE. “You admire our little church, sir?” said the sacristan to me, as we rested together upon a stone horse-block, worn smooth by the feet of many a squire and yeeman now reposing quietly in the green church-yard, skirted by the low wall which supported our backs. “Indeed, it is one of the most interesting of all the rural churches which I have seen in England.” “You come from abroad, sir?” “I am an American,” I replied. “Indeed!” And I fancied the old sacristan regarded me with a still kindlier eye. Perhaps some favorite child had left the paternal roof, and now dwelt upon New England's hills, or among the south savannahs. But I did not question the venerable man. Who knows, indeed, what chord might have been awakened? “Is there no legend connected with this church, my friend? 'Twere a pity, if not.” “That there is, sir! And if you can listen to an old man's tale, I can do no better than to while your time till we hear the steam-whistle.” “Many thanks! You will not only while the time, but, I doubt not, entertain me greatly. I own myself an inveterate legend-hunter.” The sacristan smiled, and at once commenced: “You must know, sir, that on the site of this church, which is now about one hundred and fifty years old, existed formerly a very prosperous abbey, belonging to the monks of St. Benedict, or Black Friars, as they were commonly called. It was reputed to contain great store of solid wealth; and, consequently, when the wars broke out between Cavalier and Puritan, was very speedily assaulted, dismantled, and nearly destroyed, by one of Cromwell's zealous captains, who, however, got but his labor for his pains, inasmuch as not a penny of lucre was found in possession of monk or abbot. “Nevertheless, the brotherhood—that is, such as escaped the bloody shrift so common in those days—were effectually dispersed by the violence done to their dwelling place, and since that period no black friar has ever told his beads in the neighborhood. But it was not many years before superstition began to invest the ruins with the usual dread attached to monuments of past violence, and to people with ghostly visitors the halls deserted by mortal footsteps. Meanwhile, Cromwell and his stern troopers gave place to Charles and his reckless cavaliers, and these, in turn, made way for James and his shaven monks; about which time there began to be rumors of a contemplated rebuilding of the Benedictine abbey, which set all the gossips of Suffolk to whispering about the apparition of an old friar, who on several occasions (as averred by the peasants) had been seen flitting among the ivy-mantled stones, or stooping over the broken slabs in the ancient burial-place. But the work of restoration was never commenced, though it was asserted that commissioners from the king had actually visited the place, and (as was said) entered upon negotiations with artizans. However, there was very good reason why the design of rebuilding the abbey (if such, indeed, had been entertained) should not be completed; for about this period the pious James was forced to pack up his royalty, and decamp for the French court, whilst his dutiful daughter Mary, and his-son-in-law William of Nassau, took quiet possession of his crown and kingdom. “Nearly half a century had now passed since the sack and destruction of the abbey, and its supernatural reputation had grown apace with the weeds which tangled themselves into rank luxuriance among the old walls and fallen roof-trees. Periodically was seen to walk about the grounds the ghost of an aged monk, attired in the black serge garment of the Benedictines; and more than one benighted traveller had heard (as he would swear roundly) the mumbling of mass by that black friar amid the ruins, while Satan himself (in a cowl) sat astride of a tomb-stone, delivering the responses. It is no wonder, then, that the dismantled monastery became at length known as the `De'il's Abbey,' or that it was decided to be no fit walk for Christian foot, but to be left to witches for a nocturnal trysting-place. “But about the second year of the Dutch Stadtholder's reign, it chanced that a worthy pedler, who was in the habit of vending ribbons and trinkets through the rural districts, and, by his uncommon honesty as a hawker, and good humor as a companion, enjoyed no small modicum of popularity among his rustic customers, found himself, one Michaelmas eve, in the unhappy vicinity of our haunted monastery. He had taken a short cut across the fields, in order to reach sooner the market town (where he made his home and kept a little warehouse for the goods which he trafficked up and down the country), and had just gained the wild spot on which stood the ruins, when a violent thunderstorm, arising suddenly, obliged him, for the salvation of his pack, to seek speedy shelter under one of the still upright and ivy-covered arches. He happily discovered a dry resting-place, and quickly made himself as comfortable as circumstances would allow. “It was near dark when the storm arose, and Will Nuttall, as the pedler was named, expected that it would soon spend its force, and pass away, leaving him, to be sure, the wet fields for his journey, but with the returning moon to guide his path. He miscalculated, however, the duration of the tempest, which continued to rage with unabated fury till hours had passed away, and he began to reckon midnight very near at hand. “Now, Master Nuttall was a stout-hearted and merry fellow, little troubled by ghost-stories, though was he in the habit of relating to the wide-mouthed lads and round-eyed lasses, who ever welcomed him to meat and lodging in their snug farm-houses. Nevertheless, the reflection that he was alone, at midnight, in the very headquarters of hobgoblinry, and on Michaelmas eve, too (chosen, as is well known, of all nights in the year, for witch revels and incantations), did not, it may be fancied, decrease the unpleasantness of his situation. In truth, as the night wore on, he grew somewhat more `narvish' than was his wont, and long ere the storm gave signs of lull, he had many times devoutly wished himself safely out of the `De'il's Abbey.' “At length the clouds parted, the wind sunk, and large drops succeeded to the close showers which had followed fast on one another through the night; till, at last, the moon broke out, letting its radiance gush full over field and forest, making the moist landscape glitter in silver sheen. Will Nuttall stretched his legs, rose briskly, and slung his pack, and then stepped from under the protecting arch, to pursue his homeward journey; essaying, at the same time, a lively whistle, either to summon his courage or to scare away whatsoever lurking elves might be peering at him from the still, sombre shadows of the ruins. But whistle and foot were both abruptly checked, as Will's eye glanced toward the ancient burial ground, and saw where, plainly defined in the moonlight, the figure of an old man, clad in monkish habit, was stooping near a gray tomb, not twenty paces from the spot where he himself stood. The pedler stared fixedly, unable to withdraw his eyes, though his frame shook in every joint, while the phantom friar rose slowly from its bending posture, and uplifting its hands, in one of which was grasped a black crucifix, stood a moment bolt-upright, as if invoking a curse upon the wretched mortal who had intruded on its domain. “Will Nuttall strove to run away, but his feet refused to turn; he tried to cry aloud, but his voice failed him. So, doing the only thing he could, he let his knees double under him, and sank quietly on the wet grass, where he lay prostrate for a space, shivering like one in an aguefit; expecting each moment to feel a bony hand on his head, or a pair of skeleton legs bestriding his broad shoulders. But, as neither of these consequences followed, he soon ventured to raise his head a bit, and finally, without looking toward the gray tomb stone, to bolt suddenly away into the broad, moonlit highway, a few rods off, whence he made his way homeward with all the speed he could command. “Next morning, Will Nuttall was late in setting out with his pack, and the neighbors noted that he was not in his usual spirits; but the pedler mentioned nought concerning his nocturnal adventure; for, indeed, he began already to feel ashamed of his fright, and to ask himself, how a blithe, ghost-jeering lad like Will Nuttall could have run away from some shadow of his own fancy? So he kept his counsel, and went on as usual, plying his traffic from hamlet to hamlet —getting little richer, it is true (for he was a free-hearted fellow), but making store of friends in his up and down wanderings. So a year passed away, and Michaelmas eve drew near again; and, as it chanced, found Will in the neighborhood, again, of the haunted `De'il's Abbey.' “`An arrant dolt was I to run away from my own shadow,' quoth the pedler to himself, as he called to mind his midnight terror. `Faith, I ha' e'en a mind to pass another Michaelmas at the old friar's gate, and see if mine host will bestir himself.' No sooner resolved, than Will Nuttall set forth to execute, and once more, as the moonbeams streamed brightly over the ancient ruins (with no storm to interrupt their beauty), the bold pedler appeared, hard upon the witching hour, and (as if to dare the phantom to its worst) advanced, with a stout cudgel over the shoulder which bore his pack, and took post beside the very gray tomb stone over which he had beheld the ghost-monk stooping. “But, O rash and fool hardy wight! Scarce had he reached the slab, when, turning toward the shattered arch where he had before found shelter, he beheld the self-same sight that had then appalled him. The figure of an aged monk, with cowl and crucifix, emerged from the ivied shadow, and, with slow steps, approached as if to confront him! Will Nuttall saw, and his courage evaporated. Down he subsided, as before, and, with what little strength he could muster, crawled and burrowed, until he had got himself quite underneath a broken stone hatchment that rested slantingly against the old gray tomb. Here, shrinking into as small a bulk as possible (as if he hoped by such means to elude the grim friar), he held his breath, and strove to bethink him of all the prayers which he had ever forgotten. In another moment he felt a rustle of garments close beside him, and presently a low voice muttered some strange words in a language unknown to him, to which, consequently, he did not feel himself called upon to reply, though he had his misgivings, as to whether it might not be his own death sentence, delivered by some demoniac judge. To this low voice, monotonous and rapid, the hopeless pedler listened for several minutes, and then all became silent again. Meantime, almost ready to give up his personal ghost, most bitterly did he bewail his past skepticism regarding supernatural beings, and firmly did he resolve, if delivered safe out of the black friar's clutches, to believe most devoutly henceforth in spooks, spirits, brownies, and banshees, of whatever degree, clime, or complexion. Thus fortified, he ventured, when the voice ceased, to raise his head an inch, and steal a look at his ghostly neighbor. “Very phantom-like and grim indeed was the old face which looked out from under that black cowl; and ashy were the cheeks and glassy the fixed eyes. The figure knelt against the tomb, close to the hatchment which concealed the pedler; its thin hands clasped and pressed against its breast a sable crucifix; its withered lips appeared still to move, but emitted no sound. Will Nuttall saw all this at a glance, and the next moment beheld the phantom sink bodily downward, and disappear under the church-yard sod. “Well, that, to be sure, was enough to frighten flesh and blood, however bold its possessor; so, it was no marvel that Will fainted incontinently away under his hatchment. And thus he remained until the light of a rosy morning chased off all evil things, and peered into his face, and woke him once more to the world of living things. He was drenched with the heavy night-dew, but, beyond this, had sustained no injury to his corporeal substance. “`Now am I an ass—or there be ghosts!' soliloquized Will Nuttall, as he gradually became aware of his identity, and rubbed his eyes to get a better look of every object around him. `What I ha' seen new, no Christian man may speak lightly of! Eye and ear were open, i' faith! nevertheless, if ghosts there be, it be plain, too, they ha' no power o'er mortal man, else were I not unharmed this day. So, if there harbor no malice nor hurt i' the good people, let no evil be spoken of them, say I.' “Talking thus to himself, and peering boldly about him, as he saw the sunlight brightening in the east, Will shook himself, and proceeded to impart animation to his benumbed limbs by a liberal bestowal of smart buffets on his breast. The old gray tombs began, by this time, to look cheery in the morning beams, and the ivied arches and shattered walls had lost all trace of ghostliness; nevertheless, our pedler could not help a fearsome qualm as his eyes fell upon the spot where they had beheld the black friar disappear under the sod. But Will Nuttall's look dwelt longer than before, for it had caught sudden sight of an opening just beneath the gray tomb, and close beside the hatchment which had so opportunely covered his person. The pedler stooped, and beheld a square aperture, half-concealed by dank weeds, below which were several steps of stone, apparently leading to a vault beneath the monument. Into this aperture he peered curiously, but all was dark. Only a smell of damp earth came from beneath. Will Nuttall paused a few moments, and then a strange fancy came into his mind. `If ghosts must have holes to go and come by,' quoth he, `they be little better off than people wi' bodies.' This reflection inspiring him, he hesitated not to put his best foot through the square opening and descend cautiously the slippery stones. “Very dimly lit was the sepulchral vault to which the bold hawker found his way, but he could see that it was an oblong apartment, and very much like other ancient receptacles of mortality. But what drew his notice first was a little mound of earth (near the foot of the stone steps), which seemed to have been lately disturbed, and a mattock and pick (in a niche near by), to which there yet clung several lumps of moist, yellow clay. `Ho!' said Will Nuttall, `they be strange ghosts that use mattocks to dig their graves withal.' “Will Nuttall sat himself down upon one of the stone steps, with the morning light faintly entering over his shoulder to the old vault, and began to reflect upon phantoms in general and black Benedictines in particular. The result of his cogitations was his sudden springing to his feet, seizing the pick, and digging away at the little mound with as hearty a will as if he had been a born sexton. And not long, indeed, had he to labor, ere his pick struck against a hard substance, and a few shovels full of clay removed, discovered to his wondering eyes a goodly-sized oaken chest, bound with iron bands. One or two sturdy blows sufficed to split the mouldy lid, and the poor pedler almost shrieked aloud as he beheld it filled with rusty silver coin. “Will was a shrewd fellow, and quickly determined on his course of action. The treasure could not all be removed at once, but it was not long before he had conveyed it, by piecemeal, to his little warehouse in the market-town. Then he gave out that he should no longer pursue the hawker's trade, but enlarging his shop, soon branched out into cautious speculation, until he got the reputation of a thriving tradesman, worthy of all respect. “Now, nearly seven years after this, it happened that the parish church was struck by lightning, during a storm, and so burned by the flames, that it became necessary for a public appeal to be made for a general subscription to repair the edifice. Among others, to whom the officers applied, was Will Nuttall. The good fellow looked over the list of those who had already contributed. “`What's this?' said he. `The squire but five pounds! the doctor but one pound! the—' “`It is too true!' said one of the officers. `More might they afford—but, alas! I fear our poor church will be slowly mended!' “`Here, I will do what I can!' said Will Nuttall; and he straightway subscribed twenty pounds, which so surprised the worthy deacon that had spoken, that he rubbed his spectacles thrice, as he looked at the figures. Then, bidding thanks to the tradesman, he was about to depart, when his eye caught sight of the counter on which the subscription-book had been lying, and which was a very ancient piece of oak, with strange old letters writ upon it, but scarce to be noticed, so nearly were they erased. “`Aha! you have something odd here, Master Nuttall!' said the old deacon, who was a bit of an antiquary. “`Wh—what is it?' stammered Will; for he at once recollected that this counter-slab was the lid of the old chest which had held his treasure, 6 and which he had placed in its present position as a memorial of his good fortune. “`Something I decipher—but it is in old Gothic text!' answered the worthy deacon. “`Will it please you to read it, sir?' asked Will. `I mean the English of it.' “The antiquary rubbed his spectacles, and stooping nearer, read: `In the lands Where this stood, Another stands, Twice as good.' “`Hem!' said Will Nuttall. `What may that signify? We are as wise now as before.' “`Ay!' rejoined the deacon. `For who can tell where an old oak tree stood?' “`Who indeed?' echoed Will. “But when the antiquarian deacon had gone, the good merchant said to himself: `Aha! Perhaps I can tell where it stood—and see if there be another—twice as good. I'll be off, presently.' “So, indeed, Will Nuttall lost no time in visiting the `De'il's Abbey' again, taking good care to conceal his motions from everybody. And, sure enough, some feet deeper than the spot where he had discovered the silver, was buried another coffer, not so large, but far more valuable, inasmuch as it was filled with golden crowns, instead of silver. This prize he made his own with all the caution that he had before observed. And from that time henceforth he prospered, after saying to himself: “`There is a blessing goes with helping churches.”' “And this church,” said I to the sacristan, “was built by—” “The pedler's secret treasure,” answered the old man. “Will Nuttall purchased all the land, and here erected the structure you have admired—ordering the ancient Abbey model to be preserved. Look! in yonder oriel window, do you see what is painted on the stained glass?” I looked, and saw the representation of a figure with a burden on his shoulder. “It is the pedler and his pack!” said the sacristan. “But the old monk—the Black Friar—the phantom?” I asked. “It was—” But we were interrupted, for the shrill whistle of the mail train was heard, and in another moment—whiz—“London, sir!” I was aboard, and we were off in a second. But as I looked back, I saw the sacristan wave his hand, and caught a glimpse of the pedler's church, through the grove around. And then— I had left all forever.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">KATY'S HUSBAND. BY EMILY R. PAGE. Sunshine, the rich, red sunshine of the early morning is drifting brightly into the broad valley where merry Katy Ingols lives; resting goldenly on the quaint, steep roof of the old farm-house; running laughingly along by the border of the deep wood, whose bosom is heavy and dense with eternal shadow; or laying lazily upon the green before the cottage door, where clusters of bright king-cups and purple violets grow thick among the short, tender grass. Yonder, at the foot of the long lane, where the oak boughs meet and cross each other overhead, and where great spangles of dew glisten among the nibbled and trampled clover knots, is the fair Miss Katy herself, sitting on a low stool beside her favorite brindle, and humming a pleasant air, that seems to have something of a slower and sadder tone than her usual rippling trill. The little bonneted head is bowed demurely at her task, shutting out even a glimpse of the pretty face, with its full, pouting lips and sparkling black eyes, except, now and then, when Brindle stretches her neck impatiently forward, and snuffs longingly at a fresh sprig of grass beyond her reach, and then a musical voice calls out, “So, so, Brindle,” in the gentlest of tones, and the uplifted head reveals a tear or two on the bright face, and a very troubled look in the restless eyes. What can have clouded Katy's sunny spirits? Katy, the wildest, merriest gipsey in the whole village—who is never tired of saying and doing odd things for everybody's amusement, and never so happy as when planning extravagant games, to be played off at some unfortunate offender's expense! Sprightly, laughing, roguish Katy— disturbing the gravity of staid mammas and spectacled papas, and upsetting the propriety of prim, young ladies, and bringing low the pride of the cane-flourishing, checked-pantalooned young sprigs of the neighboring town! Everybody's sunbeam, everywhere welcome, the universal favorite among the old and young of Upton, what can make Katy unhappy? And if she isn't unhappy, what is the meaning of that rueful visage and quivering lip? It is strange. Poor Katy! Perhaps that most petulant and ill-natured of bodies, Katy's step-mother, has been overturning the phials of her hatred upon her devoted head, and making her the victim of some newly devised plan of injustice or unkindness; but no! that cannot have saddened Katy, for she always laughs when her step-mother storms, and keeps quietly about her duties, growing merrier and more mischievous than ever. So, once more, what can have made Katy unhappy? Just as busily she keeps at her task, humming the same pleasant, half plaintive air, and minding nothing for our curiosity; so we are not likely to learn the secret from her. But perhaps the handsome youth, with the fine hazel eyes and curling locks, who is leaning thoughtfully over the rails yonder, and looking so tenderly, and, it seems to us, regretfully, at busy Kate, in her modest gown and sun-bonnet—perhaps he can explain the mystery of the clouded face and tearful eyes. Ah! yes, we have it now. It is a love affair, dear reader—a real love affair, our word upon it, for no less a power than wicked Cupid's could have wrought such mischief with merry, way-ward Katy. There is confession in the very raptures of the young man's gaze, as his eyes are bent so fixedly, and with a look of such tender sadness, upon the little form before him. Yes, yes, it is all plain enough now; he it is who has stolen into the fold of Miss Katy's affection, and the sombre face, with its funeral-like aspect, is in one way or another ascribable to him, we're sure of it, and, in good sooth, we do not wonder, for he is a country youth, with an honest, intelligent face, and an air of graceful ease, that speaks of cultivation and good breeding. Suddenly a movement of Katy's arouses him, and placing his hand on the topmost round of the rustic bars, he springs lightly over, and steals cautiously up behind the unwary damsel, in whose shiny tin pail the foamy milk is rising higher and higher, till now it is almost overflowing. As Katy pushed aside the rough stool, and stooped to lift the brimming pail, a quiet “good morning, Katy,” was spoken in the richest of voices, just by her side, and a hand, stronger and browner than hers, relieved her of her burden. “O, Ben, how could you frighten me so sadly?” said startled Katy, with a woefully deprecatory look, which ended with a smile and a blush that made her tenfold more bewitching than before. “But where are you going?” she added, looking wonderingly at the nicely starched linen, and fine holiday suit, in place of the accustomed straw hat and checked frock of the farmer. The young man looked grave, in spite of a prodigious effort to appear cheerful, and drawing his fair questioner aside, under the shadows of the great trees that bordered the lane, said, hastily: “Katy, I have come to bid you good-by. In half an hour I shall be on my way to New York, to take passage in the first steamer outward bound for San Francisco.” There was a slight pause, and Katy's face grew very pale, and her voice had a tone of reproach, as she asked: “Why didn't you speak of this last night, Ben?” “Ah, my child, 'twas for the very purpose that I wished you to meet me at the beech grove, intending to tell you all, but whenever I touched upon the subject—as you know I once or twice did—you grew so sad and silent that my heart misgave me, and I was fain to go away with all my bright plans unrevealed, and the farewells, which more than all else I had come to utter, unspoken. But we will not let that trouble us now, Katy. My lack of courage to say what my heart would have bidden me, has perhaps spared us both a deal of unnecessary trouble. We have no time now for useless regrets, and it is, no doubt, better that it is so.” And the young man tried to look philosophical and resigned, but the traitor hand which smoothed the short, crisp curls of the little bright head that lay on his shoulder, had a quick, nervous motion that betrayed every whit of the agitation he was struggling to conceal. “Promise me once more, dear Katy, that you will not be sad when I am gone—that nothing, not even the mistaken kindness of a father, shall turn your heart from me; and let me return to find you the same true, loving Katy that I now leave you.” “I do, I do!” sobbed Katy; and folding her for a moment to his breast, the farewell kiss was given and received, and with a murmured “God bless you, my child!” the young man turned quickly away. Re-crossing the bars with a light bound, and resuming his valise—which he had left under the shadow of the wall, he soon gained the main road, and then walked briskly forward towards the nearest railway station. Meanwhile, Katy, who dared not to be absent from the morning meal, bathed her swollen eyes in the rude drinking-trough, where Brindle had just plunged her brown nose, and hurriedly drying these with the corners of her apron, lifted her full pail, and walked wearily up the lane. Presently the unmusical voice of her step-mother screamed forth a shrill “Kat-i-ee,” and quickening her steps, she soon passed under the low archway of the old wood-house, and disappeared at the little back door. Farmer Ingols was a plodding, practical, old-fashioned body, treading reverently in the steps of his father before him, and never venturing out of the path in which he had walked. Knowing little of the outward world, beyond the rustic pale of the simple village where he lived, he set his face resolutely and decidedly against whatever bore the stamp of modernism, and looked on with placid contempt as one after another of the old landmarks were swept down, and improvement upon improvement crept up to his very door. Out of the way as he was of the great whirl of tireless action, where change succeeds change with the rapidity of thought, and invention and discovery are continually crowding out the old, it was scarcely strange that the ripples of this ceaseless outer-current, which stole in upon the quaint neighborhood of Upton, and gradually spread wider and wider about him, should be regarded with surprise and suspicion; yet, with the primitive notions that seemed to have grown up with the man, till they formed part and parcel of his nature, had he lived in the very heart of progression, with the din, and rush, and jostle of the onward movement around him, he would still have steeled his heart, and closed his eyes, and gone on in the beaten track, feeling that any deviation therefrom would be a reflection upon the venerated wisdom of those who had been pioneers in the way. Thus obstinately conservative was Farmer Ingols; yet he was kind hearted and generous natured, and withal an upright and honest man— rigidly correct in principle, but weak, unsound and wavering in judgment—easily biased and overborne, yet in his prejudices, strong, bitter and unrelenting. Such a man was the father of Katy Ingols. Long ago, while Katy was a golden-haired baby, ere Ingols Farm had as many broad acres and smiling orchards as now, the wife of his early choice, his guide and counsellor, and guardian angel, from whose tender pleadings he never turned aside impatiently, and to whose gentle voice and look of love he yielded all the sternness of his nature—she was gathered from his bosom, her hand was stayed in its labors, and her smile was darkened away from his heart, leaving him a lonely, sorrowful widower, and Katy—little, unconscious, baby Katy—a motherless orphan. Years crept on, and when the leaves of seven autumns had faded and drifted into lonesome furrows over the buried Mary, and another came to the old farm-house as the wife of its master, and the mother of his darling Katy, who had grown a laughing, roguish maiden, people gossiped and wondered, and found it passing strange that he should have given the place of the gentle being, whom he had loved and lost, to one so widely unlike her; for the now Mrs. Ingols was a cold-hearted, scheming, ambitious woman, whom many accused of manœuvre and deceit in securing her position as mistress at Ingols Farm. Certain it is that her strange self-will, joined with great perseverance, gained for her many contested points, as Farmer Ingols soon discovered, to his sorrow; for what with her unconquerable energy of purpose, and irresistible violence of temper, the reins of government very shortly passed from his hands into her own. But O, how different was the power which ruled him now, from the mild, persuasive influence to which he had once yielded himself as to the guidance of an angel! Ah! very little affection did the new wife waste upon her husband, and still less upon the innocent orphan, Katy, who danced in and out of her presence like a sunbeam, for in her heart she hated the sweet child, whom she had sworn to cherish and care for, even as a mother, because she was more beautiful and sprightly than her own little girl, the offspring of a former marriage, who was scarcely a year younger than Katy, but whom an injurious system of diet and over indulgence had made pale, sallow, and nerveless. Many were the bitter words and unmerited reproofs that Katy suffered, and oftentimes the disobedience and misconduct of the little Adelaide were attributed to her, and punished with cruel severity; but Katy was too sunny-tempered, and too careless and happy, to mind much for her step-mother's injustice; and so she lived on, flitting like a butterfly from year to year, till at last she was grown a pretty young lady, the pride and belle of the neighborhood, and, at the opening of our story, the pledged wife of the richest and most gallant young farmer in the whole country. But he, handsome, gay Ben Miller, just at this interesting stage of affairs, had, oddly enough, conceived a strange whim to try his fortunes in the golden land of California, and such a mania did it become, that no amount of persuasion nor entreaty could induce him to abandon the design. His aged mother, widowed and alone, with only him left to comfort and support her, pleaded vainly that for her sake, he would relinquish so insane a scheme. His friends ridiculed his cupidity, thinking, in their honest simplicity, that one who was superior in point of possessions to all the thriving yeomanry round about, needed nothing more to complete the measure of worldly wealth. But Ben had tired of the hum-drum life of a farmer, and if success attended this new project, as he firmly believed it would, he resolved to relinquish it forever. Besides, he had a keen relish for the novel, and a fearless, daring spirit, that courted rough seas and rude gales, rather than the placid wave and the calm sky, and there was something irresistible in the thought of the wild, free life of hazard and hardship that he would lead away among the rocks and rivers, and savage fastnesses of that untamed land, where, in imagination, he had so often pitched his tent. There was but one bitter drop in the cup which he raised to his lips, and that was the thought of leaving the little sunny maiden, who had wound herself so closely around all the fibres of his heart; but he reflected that he would soon return, with wealth, that rare auxiliary of worth, sufficient to place her in a situation better suited to her gifts and graces than the one she now occupied, and this thought re-assured and gave him new courage. Yes, he had set his heart upon going, and he would go; so, seeing his determination, and feeling that it would be useless to oppose it, Miss Katy wisely resigned herself to his caprice, and even favored it with her approval, because she knew well that so long as his love of adventure remained ungratified, he would be restless, discontented and unsettled; and, although this sage conclusion of Katy's clouded her bright spirits for many a day, yet she felt it to be for the best, and had too much good sense to yield to fruitless repinings or regrets. Not so with Katy's father! What could be more directly in opposition to all his ancient conservative prejudices than this present movement of the young man, upon whom he had so recently smiled as the favored suitor of his daughter? He was amazed and horror-stricken as he listened to a recital of Ben's intentions, and assuring the youngster that he must be quite out of his wits, positively refused the paternal sanction to his union with Katy un less he remained at home, cared dutifully for his mother, and kept at work like a rational man, to improve the lands which he had inherited! Many were the wise maxims which Farmer Ingols quoted to sustain his point, ending at length with the firm declaration that he, to whom he gave his daughter, must be a man of steady, industrious habits, in whose future sobriety and prosperity he could feel entire confidence. Of course this stipulatory consent was a very serious matter with Ben, until Katy, herself, assured him of her conviction that a successful trip to the mining regions, resulting in the acquirement of a few additional thousands, would do wonders towards dissipating the very violent prejudices of her thrift-loving parent, who, like most matter-of-fact men, had a great leaning towards the substantial and the palpable, and a profound contempt for whatever appeared visionary, or in the least unreal. Thus assured, Ben proceeded at once to make arrangements for his immediate departure, which, however, he found could not be as speedily effected as he had hoped; for there were tenants to be secured, and directions to be given, and disposals to be attended to, and provision to be made for his mother's comfort. But at last all were completed, and with a few kind words of parting, uttered hurriedly under the shadow of the great trees in the lane, and one long kiss on Katy's quivering lips, he had gone, and Katy went busily about her morning duties, crushing back the gathering tears, and hiding her sorrow away in her heart, wickedly resolving that she would be just as gay, and wild, and merry, as though there were no such bodies as truant lovers in the world! Now and then there flitted a little shadow over the sunshine of her face, and now and then there was, to be sure, a dreamy look in her eyes, as she replied to some question of her step-mother's with an answer quite foreign to the subject; but it was scarcely noticed, or, if at all, no one suspected its cause, and when the dinner-hour arrived, and she seated herself in her accustomed place, it was with a comfortable feeling of relief, like that of the actor-novice, who has played successfully his first part. Mistaken Katy! Little did she know how unseasonable were her congratulations! But the hour of trial was yet to come! “Waal,” commenced Farmer Ingols, as with fork plunged to its horny handle in the smoking meat, and carving-knife dexterously insinuated between the obstinate bones, he sawed away very vigorously upon the steaming shoulder of mutton; “waal, they say young Miller has cleared out, after all! Run away, I should call it; as good as that! People ginally—so Captain Busybody says—don't think he'll ever come back agin. He's hired Parson Goodman and his wife to live up there with his mother, and take care on her two years sartin, and I guess folks don't know how much longer!” Here the worthy old gentleman seated himself, and commenced deliberately filling the six empty plates that were successively passed to him, as he continued: “He's showed himself to be a silly, wuthless feller, anyhow, leavin' a good home like hisn, and one that he could allers be sure on, to go clean off to that humbug California, amongst the Injuns and bears. It tells just what he is, though. I don't want to know him no better'n I do now!” said he, stirring his tea with considerable energy, and gradually warming with his increased interest in the subject, as he proceeded: “Here he's got the best farm in Upton—everything about in fust rate order—buildin's and fences in good repair—owns the best stock of cattle in the country, and there's nothin' to hinder him from bein' independently rich if he'd only stay to home and tend to his business like an honest man. But I'm proper glad I squared off matters pretty even between him and Katy, here, and,” as he helped himself to a very large potato from the bowl standing just by her plate, he looked with an expression of immense self-commendation full in her face, which was crimson with tell-tale blushes, belieing the apparent unconcernedness with which she listened. But Farmer Ingols was quite blind—wilfully so, perhaps—to her agitation, and added, decisively: “No gal of mine shall ever marry sich a rakish, unstiddy feller as he, with my consent!” “You'd better thought of that and said it long afore, I guess,” sharply remarked Mrs. Ingols, with an air of majestic indifference. “I allers told ye no good would come of him,” and so, indeed, Mrs. Ingols always had; for how could she be expected to see any merit in a young gentleman who could pass by her own attractive lady-daughter, to pay his court to such an unwomanly romp as Miss Katy? Yes, Mrs. Ingols had always raised her voice against him; for it was an exceeding bitter disappointment, both to her maternal love and pride, that the pretty white house yonder, in the valley, and its handsome owner, over both of which she had once fondly hoped to see her idolized Adelaide mistress and manager, should have been virtually surrendered to the possession of another; and she never forgave either Ben or her step-child, that they had so ordained it. It was in part through her influence, perhaps, that Farmer Ingols had been led to a just appreciation of the worthlessness of the young man's character, so manifested in his unfortunate inclination to forsake the employment of his father's, and, in defiance of ancient custom, go abroad! At all events, however, little interest she suffered herself to manifest in the matter; she secretly rejoiced in the knowledge of the young man's departure, involving, as it did, the refusal of Katy's hand by the obdurate parent; and she hoped, by clever management, to ensure its early bestowal elsewhere, that thus she might provide at last a chance of securing the returning Californian for her dowerless daughter! So she reasoned, as she addressed herself diligently to the well-filled plate before her, now and then pausing, and gravely sipping her fragrant Souchong—for the Ingols had always preserved the time-honored practice of serving up tea at dinner—and the remainder of the meal was completed in silence, much to the relief of poor Katy, who stole quickly away from the table, and gliding unobserved from the house, was soon hidden among the heavy shrubbery, midway down the lane, where, but a few hours before, she had been fondly clasped to the manly bosom of her lover, and leaning her head against the mossy trunk of an old tree, and burying her face in her hands, she burst into a passion of tears, which she could no longer restrain. A few months had gone by, and Katy was again in the wildest of spirits, overflowing with mischief and merriment, and just as rosy and roguish as though she were not, twenty times in a day, compelled to listen to some ill natured jeer in open reference to “the renegade lover of hern,” and as though her obstinate father had not, in the faithful discharge of what he considered his duty to himself, persisted in first reading, and then burning, the only message which had yet reached her from the wanderer, without vouchsafing to her even so much as a glimpse at its contents, but firmly assuring her that all subsequent communications, from the same source, would meet with the same warm reception at his hands, as he tossed it impatiently behind the blazing back-log in the enormous old-fashioned chimney. But most unaccountably, to be sure, none of these things had power to disturb Miss Katy in the least! She had stolen a saucy glance at the post-mark on the unfortunate letter, and (as what woman under like circumstances would not?) straightway found means to communicate privately with her lover, and, wickedly enough, was very happy in the thought of the unfilial plans she had devised to defeat the wise purposes of her father! Perhaps, indeed, from her natural relish for mischief, and her inherent Eve-like propensities, she was even happier in the delightful consciousness of the quiet enjoyment of forbidden fruit! However this might have been, she was never more gay or giddy than now, and there was no end to the wild plans by which she contrived to punish the presumption of the enamored Upton youths for taking unfair advantage of Mr. Ben's absence, to urge their own unsuccessful suits; or to the quaint, arch drollery with which she teased and bantered the jealous damsels who envied her unconscious power. Just at this juncture came Uncle Lenox, from the city, with his elegant carriage and splendid bays, and a retinue of baggage that was really formidable, and a smiling, good-natured face, that said very plainly, as he shook hands warmly and heartily with the whole family, from Farmer Ingols, who was his only brother, down to the little dirty chore-boy, with his wide grin and awkward air, “Yes, yes, I'm welcome; I know I am—don't trouble yourself to say so—I shall make myself quite at home with you. Am glad to see you all, and mean to enjoy my visit amazingly!” And so he did, jolly, kind-hearted old gentleman that he was—not, however, by sitting moped up in the cheerless parlor all day, where Mrs. Ingols tried to imprison him, but much to that worthy lady's horror and scandal, by playing at hearty games of romps, hither and thither, with merry Miss Katy, joining with a true relish in her maddest frolics, and now and then laughing uproariously as he caught her unsuspectedly by popping suddenly round a corner, or dodging from behind an unclosed door. O, rare sport had Uncle Lenox with his way-ward little niece, and right well did he enjoy it, too, and never did weeks whirl by with such charmed swiftness as the four that he spent at Ingols Farm, bringing, almost unconsciously, the hour for his departure. He had been kind, and frank, and social with all—he had been good-naturedly bland to the sharpness and oftentimes rudeness of Mrs. Ingols—blind to the insipidness and shallow affectations of her daughter, and blind to the unfortunately obstinate defects that marred the otherwise noble character of his brother, whom he loved with all the warmth and freshness of boyhood. He had brought the most costly and appropriate gifts for all; rich shawls and glittering brocades, and fine furs, for the ladies; and soft cloths, and handsome garments, a la mode— a novel dress for Farmer Ingols!—for his brother, and no one could detect a trace of partiality in their bestowal. Yet it was, nevertheless, evident to all that Katy was his favorite, his pet, his pride—and so she was; and how could he think of leaving her behind him, of depriving himself of her sunny presence, of going back to his splendid home, where there were none to welcome him but those who served for him, and of sitting alone in his great, magnificent library, where there was no sweet, young voice to make music to his heart, no light, young foot to flit over the soft carpets, and give life and brightness to the sombre rooms, and no merry, gushing laugh to respond to his own happy humor? No, no! this dismal picture should never be realized. He had found a treasure in Katy—a sunbeam to gladden his bachelor home; and so, to the astonishment of everybody—even Katy herself—who had never dreamed of such marvellous good fortune, the morning of Uncle Lenox's departure found her in the neat travelling habit, which had been among the number of his gifts, seated beside him upon the soft cushions of the great, easy carriage, laughing and chatting in her lively, rippling way, that reminded one of the gush and gurgle of a June rivulet, and rolling pleasantly away to her new home in the great city. For once, Farmer Ingols had been induced to yield his prejudices—not so much from the entreaties of his brother, or the persuasions of his wife, as from his own settled conviction that nothing could so effectually obliterate from Katy's heart any regretful remembrances of her lover, or place her so completely beyond the reach of his power, as thus to remove her from all the influences which might act in his favor, or from any possibility of direct communication—so, with many earnest, secret charges to Uncle Lenox, touching that “scapegrace of a feller,” and urging the watchful care which he would be expected to exercise in that particular direction (to all of which the good man listened quietly, with now and then a mischievous twinkle in his fine gray eye), he hopefully resigned Miss Katy to the guidance and protection of his brother, rejoicing, as he did so, in the thought that his plans for defeating her persevering suitor were now secure of their accomplishment! Mrs. Ingols, too, very warmly seconded her husband's decision, and strongly sustained his belief in regard to the probable result of Katy's removal—doing so, however, from motives altogether foreign to Katy's interest, but with an eye to the advantages which her absence would confer upon her own precious child, to whom the field would be unreservedly yielded in the event of the unfortunate young lover's return! Miss Adelaide, who was languid and listless, and seldom burdened herself with opinions of any kind, thought very little, and cared very little about the matter, except to thank her stars that there would be no one to tease her now, and no one to spoil her cozy morning naps by calling her at unseasonable hours,—and so, it was with quite a pleasant feeling of satisfaction, among all parties, that the leave-takings were concluded, and the group on the porch of the old-fashioned farm-house stood watching the handsome carriage till it disappeared round a curve in the winding road. “Wife!” exclaimed Father Ingols, as with great deliberation and composure he re-folded and placed upon the table, by his side, the letter which he had just been perusing, “wife!”—a pause of momentous import succeeded, and then, while a look of proud satisfaction rested upon his usually immovable features, he added, impressively—“Katy is married!” “She aint, though,” jerked out that lady in a tone of surprise that labored with ill-suppressed joy at the announcement, “why, how sudden! Who is he?” “That's what I don't know, yet; but hear what Uncle Lenox says about him,” and unfolding the letter, he read: “I think you will be pleased with your new son-in-law, and approve of my selection, for which I take upon myself great credit. I believe he possesses, to an eminent degree, all the qualifications which you would desire the husband of your daughter to possess. He is looked upon as one of the most promising young men in our city—of good habits, active, talented, re fined, rich, and withal, a rare good fellow! Let me congratulate you, my dear brother.” “There,” said the old gentleman, warmly, “I allers knowed Katy would make out smart in the world, if I could get her away from that good-for-nothing Miller! She may thank me for putting my foot down that he should never have her, and sendin' her off with Uncle Lenox; if I hadn't, ten to one if the sneakin' scamp hadn't managed to carry her off, unbeknown to me, afore this time!” “Well, it's a leetle strange, isn't it,” interrupted Mrs. Ingols, wearing a pleased look, in spite of the disagreeable reflection that would occur to her, that Katy had married a rich husband, after all, “it's a leetle strange that Miller is expected home to-morrer!” “How'd know?” said the farmer, looking doubtful. “Parson Goodenow told me, this mornin', as he stopped to git a drink o' water at the well; he says they had a letter from him last night that was mailed to Boston, so he's on his way, and a'most here, that's sartain.” “Humph! Well, wonder if his mother wasn't obleeged to send him money to git home with. I allers prophesied she would. See,” he added, musingly, “how long's it been since he went off?” “Jest two year the fust of last month,” said the wife, who, from some unaccountable cause, had preserved the real date with scrupulous exactness. “Well, if he comes, let him come. I'm glad Katy's clear on him, though. But it's curis that she should be comin' the same day, aint it?” “She comin' the same day!” echoed Mrs. Ingols, unable to proceed further. “Sartain! But I haint read that, have I?” and turning again to the letter, he continued: “Expect us all at Ingols Farm to-morrow! We shall be a merry party, I predict, for I am just beginning to realize that I am one of the happiest old fellows in existence, which sets me in high good spirits, you must know, and then the new groom and bride are not one whit behind their old uncle, and when escaped from city restraint, I cannot answer for the infringements we may make upon the sober order of your quiet house.” “Turn everything topsy turvy, I warrant it;” and Mrs. Ingols, in the height of her vexation, flounced from the room, without waiting to hear another word. * * * * * The shrill shriek of the locomotive started up sharp echoes among the neighboring hills, as the afternoon train came dashing and rushing along into quiet Upton village. Farmer Ingols, in his best clothes and double wagon, into which were harnessed old black Peter and the bay Jilly, had repaired to the depot at a seasonable hour, and returned with Uncle Lenox, Katy, and his new son-in-law, in whom it was plain that he already felt a deal of fatherly pride, as he presented him to one after another of the family. And really, it was a justifiable pride, for the glowing picture that Uncle Lenox had painted of Katy's husband was more than realized in the elegant and gentlemanly Mr. Burkley, who united, with the most prepossessing exterior, a faultless manner, and singularly fascinating address. Genial, witty and graphic, with seemingly exhaustless resources, he was the person of all others to attract and engage the delighted old gentleman. For more than an hour, Farmer Ingols listened, with the most intense interest and admiration, as the young stranger discoursed, in his charmingly fresh, piquant style, upon all the various topics of the times, passing so easily and naturally from one subject to another, that the transition was scarcely noticed. Meanwhile, Katy and Uncle Lenox had stolen out of the low window that opened on the porch, and were romping, like children, under the trees in the great front yard. Mrs. Ingols, who had only bowed stiffly and distantly to the young Mr. Burkley, and welcomed the new comers in a rather crusty manner, had gone immediately from the room, and not yet re-appeared. Miss Adelaide lounged dreamily in an easy arm-chair, into which she had sunk as soon as the ceremony of introduction was over, and thought it very stupid to be compelled to sit and listen to the handsome visitor, who, to her understanding, talked on the driest of subjects in the dullest of manners, and yet she had not sufficient energy to remove herself beyond reach of the annoyance. But she was spared the trouble of exerting herself to be relieved of the infliction, for just as the speaker was growing animated in the discussion of a favorite theme, a pretty knot of freshly-gathered flowers shot in at one of the open windows, and struck him full in his face, while at the same moment, Katy's clear, laughing voice, outside, said, saucily: “Benjamin Burkley! Uncle Lenox and I are going down to the barns to hunt hens'-nests, and should be extremely happy to be honored by your distinguished presence, if agreeable! Take your father along with you, if you haven't gossipped sufficiently.” Here the bright curly head popped suddenly behind a cluster of lilacs, just in season to escape the flowery missile from the window, which whizzed through the air and lodged harmlessly at her feet. “Jest the same old sixpence,” laughed Farmer Ingols, as he watched her light form flying, like a bird, over a neighboring pasture-ground, with Uncle Lenox in full chase. “Jest sich a giddy-headed mad-cap as she used to be—nothin' can sober her—but,” he added, seeing that the young man had risen, and stood, hat in hand, preparatory to going out, “you'd better be a leetle careful, and keep on the look-out, if you're goin' to venter into them barns with that creetur! She's got some game brewin' to play off on you, you may depend! She'd like nothin' better than to git you up on the high beams, and then slide you down, head first, and you might break your neck, like enough. Presume you aint much acquainted with sich places as farmers' barns?” “O, yes, sir,” returned the young man, smiling, “I was born and bred on a farm.” “Was you, indeed?” said the old gentleman, with a vast deal of surprise in his tone. “O, waal, then you'll be safe enough.” “But you will accompany us, will you not?” “No. I rather guess I wont, this time; I'll go out with you, after supper, and show you over my farm, if you like.” Of course, Mr. Burkley expressed his satisfaction with the arrangement, and bowing politely, passed out. “Waal,” said the farmer, with a pleasant sparkle in his eye, as he walked into the kitchen, where Mrs. Ingols, with a very ominous frown and nervous motion, was busy in preparing supper, “Katy's done waal! I tell you what 'tis, wife, he aint nobody's fool, this Burkley aint! 'Taint every day you see sich a feller as he, depend upon it, wife, and I feel proud on him, if I do say it,” and here the old gentleman rubbed his hands in great good humor, and took two or three hasty turns up and down the spacious room. “Waal, waal, I'm glad if she's got somebody that's good enough for her, and you're suited, that's all,” replied the lady, rather snappishly, and in no very congratulatory tone, and then, as she gave the sieve a more vigorous shake, preparatory to returning it to the flour barrel by her side, she added: “Perhaps if you had 'em to wait upon, and all the vittels to git, this hot weather, you wouldn't think it was quite so fine to have 'em all quartered here, at any rate; but it is little you care about it, as it is. That's allers the way—the men can set in the parlor and take their ease, while their wives are a slavin' and drudgin' in the kitchen to wait upon their fine company;” and in the heat of her indignation she wiped her angular face, and fanned herself vigorously with the great gingham handkerchief which she had just unpinned from her neck. 'Twas of no use for Farmer Ingols to remind his amiable spouse of the successive “helps”— the Marys and Susans and Betseys—that her turbulent temper had driven from the house, till there was no longer any one who could be induced to serve her for “love or for money.” No! 'twas of no use to urge this unpleasant fact —she would not listen, and Farmer Ingols wisely retired from her presence. 'Twas plain that this accession to her family was by no means agreeable to the worthy hostess, and as her only practicable method of revenge, she seemed determined upon making every one about her as uncomfortable as possible, to which end she took great care to aggravate her unhappy mood by the most irritating reflections—trying steadily to persuade herself, in spite of her own convictions to the contrary, that she was really the most ill-treated wife in the world, and had just cause to complain and look tartly, and be ungracious and inhospitable to the intruding guests. But, in spite of all her efforts to be miserable, one solitary thought, a redeeming source of consolation, would keep suggesting itself with the most obstinate pertinacity. Her mind would keep wandering away from her grievances, and the biscuit she was kneading, to the handsome white house in the valley, and, naturally enough, from the house to the handsome owner, who had, probably, ere that hour, returned to his inheritance—and there, how could she repress a malicious looking grin of satisfaction that the interesting Mr. Burkley had put a veto upon Katy's rivalship, and that there was now no hindrance in the way of her own and Miss Adelaide's success? She couldn't, of course, and was looking quite amiably savage, when Katy danced in at the old back door, with her sprightly step and sunshiny face, and holding fast, with both her hands, a hat full of “precious eggs,” of which she had robbed every attainable nest within and without the barns. “Why, mamma, haven't you any one to help you?” said she, sympathizingly. “O, what a rare chance to display my culinary abilities,” and in another minute, the flowing muslin skirt was tucked demurely about her waist, the pretty sleeves gathered above the dimpled elbows, and the active little sprite tripping lightly in and out at the pantry door, preparing tea, mixing tarts, and spreading the cloths, with all the ease and skill of an accomplished house maid. “Guess you haint forgot what I teached you, if you have got to be a fine lady,” growled Mrs. Ingols, in acknowledgment of her services, as they passed into the supper-room; which remark, considering that Katy's accomplishments in that branch of domestic education were all of her own acquiring, without the benefit of any body's instruction, was rather an equivocal compliment —but Katy did not reply, except with a quiet smile, and was soon chattering away as merrily as a bird, paying no heed to the ill-humor of her step-mother, who poured the tea with a stiff dignity, and answered in frigid monosyllables when addressed. Notwithstanding her chilling influence, however, the table-chat was pleasant and free from restraint, and as soon as the meal was completed, Farmer Ingols rose abruptly, and turning to Mr. Burkley, said: “Now, sir, I guess we'll walk a spell, if you please—or, mebbe you'd rather ride round the farm?” he added, inquiringly; “you can jest as waal.” But Mr. Burkley declared he greatly preferred walking, and the two set off in advance of the rest of the party (which was to consist of Uncle Lenox and Katy only—Mrs. Ingols and Miss Adelaide declining to accompany them), with the promise that they would follow, as soon as Katy had assisted in setting the “tea-things” to rights, and Uncle Lenox had completed his accustomed Havana. “And whose is the little white cot, just here at our feet?” asked Mr. Burkley, as the two gentlemen paused on the height of a gentle slope commanding a broad view of a fine portion of Ingols Farm, as well as many of the neighboring lands. “O, that belongs to a vagabond of a feller, who was jest shiftless enough to leave all this handsome property, and go rovin' off to Californy. He wanted my Katy, I s'pose,” said the farmer, with a confidential smile, to his companion, “but when I see what his habits was, I set him adrift pretty sudden, and managed so that she could keep clear on him afterwards.” Here he proceeded to give his son-in-law a minute account of his successful efforts to preserve her from the foul clutches of Miller, but stopped short, as one of Katy's clear laughs, and the heavier, but no less hearty, “ha, ha, ha!” of Uncle Lenox, rang out just at his elbow, and in another instant, Katy was dancing at a good rate down the slope, followed closely by her hatless lord, whose beaver she had most skilfully captured, while he stood-profoundly absorbed in the story of her former lover's discomfiture. As they neared the little white cottage, however, the hat was restored, and somewhat to the good farmer's astonishment, both disappeared at the open door. “Ah!” said he, after a moment's pause, with an audible chuckle, “I'm glad they're gone in there; they say young Miller's to be home to-day, and I guess it'll punish his impertinence some, to see her with that splendid husband of hern! I should like to see the meetin'!” “Suppose we call, then, and get a glimpse of the fun,” suggested Uncle Lenox. “So we will, so we will, brother,” and as they were shown into the pleasant sitting-room, they caught the murmured words—“Ben, my dear son Ben, God bless you!”—and saw good, kind old Mrs. Miller clasped fondly in the warm embrace of Mr. Burkley! Close by, stood Katy, looking very conscious and very wicked, and smiling roguishly, in spite of her tears; but her smile grew still more mischievous, as she turned, with great deliberation, to her father, standing, “a monument of open-mouthed amazement,” and begged the pleasure of presenting her husband—Mr. Benjamin Burkley Miller! “What! who!” sputtered the farmer, as he half accepted the proffered hand of his smiling son-in-law. “You—Mr. Burkley—Ben Miller! How, in the name of wonder”—but his astonishment was interrupted by an explosion of merriment from Katy, and a roar of laughter from Uncle Lenox, who, having been chief manager in the plot, of which this was the result, could smother his excessive enjoyment no longer. We leave the reader to imagine the indescribable wrath of Mrs. Ingols, when she discovered the actual appropriation of the pretty cottage and owner; but it is necessary to say, that since the mists of prejudice have been fully dissipated, Farmer Ingols looks with great complacency and pride upon Katy's Husband!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE ROBBER BARON. BY PHILIP LEE, JR. There was not a maiden in all Calabria fairer than the beauteous daughter of old Herr Von Arnhelm. For, being brought up from infancy in the free air of the forest, she possessed all those natural graces which are so fascinating when unrestrained by the formalities of fashion. Her father was a tenant on the manor lands of the young baron, Lord Eldred de Gottingen. The fair Lizetta possessed a buoyant spirit, which threw a gleam of happy joyousness around her father's humble cottage. She had never known a mother's maternal love, for she had died when her daughter was but a few days old, leaving her babe in the care of her husband. Though he was a rugged mountaineer, yet he possessed a father's feelings, and he loved his daughter tenderly. And no wish of hers remained ungratified which came within the scope of his humble means. Hitherto her life had been one unobstructed stream of happiness; and her love for young Lorando Ruric was soon to be consummated in marriage. But she was loved by the Lord Eldred, who had seen her one day in the forest, in one of his hunting excursions, and from that day he resolved to win her, by fair means or foul. With the intention of winning her regard, he had often contrived to meet her during her rambles in the forest; for she had an inquiring mind after knowledge, and enthusiastically appreciated the beauties and sublimities of nature spread out everywhere before her view. When they had met, she had always repulsed his address courteously yet firmly. During one of these rambles she was disturbed in her contemplation of the majestic grandeur of the scenery around her by a figure which emerged from among the trees and confronted her. One glance sufficed to show her the form of Lord Eldred. She would have fled homeward, but he laid one hand on her arm and held her fast. “Ah, my pretty bird, have I got you at last, though much you have tried to elude my vigilance. I now desire to know my fate from your fair lips.” “Unhand me, sir!” cried the maiden, at the same time struggling vehemently to free herself from his grasp. “By what right do you treat an unprotected maiden in this manner?” “By what right? Ho, my pretty one, by the right any one would another when their love is repulsed. But I have the happy announcement to make, that you are to become my wife.” “Me your wife!” cried the maiden, looking at him in alarm. “You dare not do it. Unhand me, sir, or I will cry for help.” “Your cries here will be of no avail. The forest will only return the echoes of your voice, in mockery to your appeals for help. And as to your becoming my wife, we will see what effect a confinement in the lowest dungeons of my castle will have on your decision. And you need not think that Lorando Ruric will come to your rescue, for he but yesterday fell on the battle-field.” Having given this consoling information, he placed a bugle to his lips and blew a long, shrill blast. This was quickly answered at a distance in a similar manner; and in a short time a party of armed retainers issued from the mazes of the forest and stood in waiting for the commands of their chief. “Here, Beppo,” cried Lord Eldred, addressing one who looked as if he commanded the party by his air of authority, and withal a villanous looking personage, “take this refractory bird to the castle, and put her in the lowest dungeon of the prison, and have her strictly guarded until I order otherwise.” “Ah, ah. I'll do it with a right good will,” answered the worthy personage mentioned above. “And if she escapes, my head may answer for the consequences.” “Never mind your head,” said the baron, “for I guess it's of no consequence; but do as I bid you.” The band then, at a sign from Beppo, seized Lizetta, and, in spite of her shrieks and entreaties, bound and gagged her, and then moved silently off towards the castle. From the incidents already recorded, the reader will probably conclude that the character of Lord Eldred was not wholly unstained by those vices which were so prevalent in the times of which we write. And in such surmises he will be correct. For, from his earliest boyhood, he had followed unrestrained the bent of his own inclinations, unchecked by the dictates of reason or prudence; consequently, he grew up with an obstinate or headstrong will. Therefore, in his love for Lizetta, he was not to be foiled by her refusal, even if he had to resort to stringent, if not more dishonorable, means. But to return to the maiden. When the cavalcade arrived at the castle gate, at the sound of the horn the portcullis was lowered, and the whole party was soon within the castle yard. A few minutes only elapsed, and then she was conducted to a low, damp dungeon, in the left wing of the castle, where she was left to her own reflections, and they were not of the most comfortable nature, as she pondered over her future prospects. She was now in the power of a man whom she loathed as the reptiles which crawl upon the earth. But she resolved to die rather than submit to any of his propositions. And then the death of her lover. Could she believe it? and yet it was probable, for the war had lately become more sanguinary in its character than at first. She also thought of her father, how, if he knew of her retreat, he would fly to her rescue, or die in the attempt. But, alas! no one friendly to her knew of her retreat. She was surrounded by the retainers of Lord Eldred, who were ready to execute his commands, no matter what they might be. A person now came in with some refreshment, and informed her that the baron would visit her on the morrow. She made no reply, but only gave the attendant a despairing look. The door then closed, the key grated harshly in the lock, and she was once more left alone. Slowly the hours wore on, and not a sound broke the stillness save the measured tread of the sentinel, as he paced up and down the dull corridor. But at last the castle clock tolled the hour of one. The moon had risen in unclouded splendor. The tread of the sentinel had died away, sleep having obtained the predominance over vigilance; and universal stillness reigned throughout that vast pile. Lizetta still sat in the same position she had assumed on her first entering the cell, with her eyes fixed despairingly on the walls of her prison-house. Suddenly a ray of light entered a crevice in the wall, and fell on the floor at her feet. She started up, and gazed through the interstice. As she gazed a sudden idea seemed to strike her, and so overcome was she with the suddenness of the thought, that she sank down on the floor and covered her face with her hands. She remained in that position for some minutes, and when she at last arose to her feet, she was calm and her face wore a look of fixed determination to effect a purpose which had so suddenly crossed her mind. It was no less than a hope of effecting her escape which had animated her to action. That part of the castle in which the cell was situated was in a great state of dilapidation, and as Lizetta approached the wall through which the light entered, she with joy beheld a great part of it ready to crumble down at the slightest touch. She listened awhile, but no sound broke the solemn stillness which prevailed. She then cautiously approached the tottering mass, and gave it a slight push, when a portion fell with a noise that reverberated through the dim corridors with fearful distinctness. However, the noise did not appear to have disturbed any one, so she proceeded, but with great caution, as there were obstacles still to be encountered which seemed almost insurmountable; but, by dint of great perseverence, she got over the wall. But even now her prospect of escape seemed hopeless, for, though she was now in the open air, the way was thickly strewed with broken columns and large stones, while the thorns and briers grew in rank profusion around. But delay was dangerous; for the noise of the falling wall had waked the drowsy sentinel, who, after listening for some moments, concluded to enter the cell to see what was the matter. But he opened his eyes with astonishment, when he perceived that the bird had flown. But to return again to the fair prisoner. After emerging from the wall, she hurried on as fast as difficulties would permit. For the castle was now thoroughly aroused; lights were flashing on the walls, the culverin was belching forth its hoarse notes, and the castle bell sent forth its deep-toned notes of alarm. Lizetta had now entered the forest shades, and soon after entering, she suddenly came to an opening in which the moonbeams shone with the softest radiance. And here, to give the reader a better idea of the locality, we will briefly describe it. It was the ruins of one of those large castles which the barons erected during the prevalence of the fendal system, and behind whose frowning battlements they had sometimes even opposed the power of their sovereign. The owner of this once impregnable castle had fought and died in the Holy Land during the Crusades. From that time the castle had sunk into ruins, and, among the peasantry around it, had the reputation of being haunted. And many were the stories told of dark forms having been seen moving up its dark corridors, and shrieks and groans being heard from its walls. But, perhaps, the beaming of the moon from under a cloud, or the wind howling through its dim aisles, might have offered a solution of its mysterious character. But the superstitions of that age were deeply rooted, and no explanation would have been accepted, as the marvellous was loved for its very fearfulness. There were, however, a few, who, being more intelligent, were not so superstitious as the mass. And among them was our heroine, who approached the ruins without any fear, though she could not restrain a feeling of awe, as she contemplated the majestic grandeur of a sight so imposing, gilded as it was with the moonbeams lighting up its old gray columns and crumbling terraces with a flood of soft light. But the danger behind her was increasing. She could hear the clear notes of the bugle ringing out on the clear night air. She could hear the portcullis come down with a crash, and the clatter of horses' hoofs thundering over the stone pavement, as they dashod out in pursuit of the fugitive. All these came with fearful distinctness to her ears. How was she to evade pursuit? The night air blew with biting keenness, and she had endured hardships in effecting her escape which her frame would have sunk under on ordinary occasions. Besides, she knew not in what part of the forest she was, for, though she had often heard of the old haunted castle, she knew not its exact location. She was just on the point of giving up in despair, when she saw a figure moving among the ruins, and which riveted her attention, for it was coming directly towards her. But, as it came forward, a sudden tremor came over her, for she recognized the form of her lover. The thought flashed quickly through her mind: could he have risen from the grave? For she did not suspect that Lord Eldred had deceived her. The hardships of the night, combined with the emotions she now felt, were too much for her weakened frame; she sunk into a swoon. When she came to a consciousness of her situation, she was held in the arms of her lover, who appeared to be bona fide flesh and blood, and he was gazing down intently on her face with anxious solicitude. “O, dear Lorando!” she exclaimed, “this is a happy, happy moment; for I have been persecuted since your absence until I was weary of life. O, how glad I am you have returned!” And the maiden wept from very happiness. “But, my dear Lizetta,” said her lover, “how, in the name of all that's wonderful, did you come in this situation?” “Why, the Baron Eldred sought to force me to become his wife, and I but a short time since escaped from his dungeon. But were you not severely wounded on the battle-field, for the baron told me that you were killed?” “Did he tell you that? Ha! ha! the perfidious wretch! But be not alarmed for my safety, for I received only a slight wound on the arm.” “O, let us fly from hence!” cried the maiden, as the trampling of horses' feet were heard not far off. “For the minions of the baron are already on my track.” “Then, by the holy cross,” exclaimed the youth, energetically, “I will meet him, and chastise him for his insolence.” Saying this, the young officer (for he had received a high post in the army about two weeks previous) placed a small hand-trumpet to his lips, and blew a low but shrill note. In a moment, as if by magic, a large number of soldiers, in the imperial uniform, came out from behind the old ivy-covered pillars, and approached them. “Be not surprised,” said the youth, as he noticed the bewildered look of the maiden, “for I have lately received an appointment in the army. And I was sent to these old ruins to-night, with my regiment, to surprise a band of banditti, who are supposed to have their rendezvous within its old walls. And I have obtained indubitable evidence of the Baron Lord Eldred de Gottingen being the leader of this terrible band, which has so long infested this forest, and been a terror to travellers in these parts.” He then conducted the maiden within the shade of a large pillar, at some distance off, where she would be safe from harm during the expected conflict. He then returned to his men, in order to place them in an advantageous position for the approaching combat, which he did by dividing them in two parties, and placing one on either side of the road. Hardly had the preparations been hastily executed, when the party appeared in sight, at a short distance off, coming at a moderate pace; for the broken columns and walls, together with the brambles and thorns which grew thickly about, presented a strong impediment to their faster progression. As they proceeded, every hedge and projecting column was searched. But when they caught sight of the soldiers, drawn up in such formidable array to receive them, they all drew rein, as if by common consent. The baron, who rode in front, turned pale with a guilty consciousness that his schemes, whatever they may have been, were discovered. But his confusion was but momentary, for, turning to his men, he gave a few orders in a low tone; when the whole party wheeled around, and started off from the place. But this was only a feint of the baron's to divert the attention of his antagonists, so as to set them in pursuit, and then suddenly charge on them. But in this he was disappointed, for they remained unmoved, no doubt suspecting his design. Seeing the scheme frustrated, they wheeled around, and charged with terrific force. But the disciplined soldiers received them with undaunted bravery, and many a horse, bounding riderless away, testified to their prowess. For an hour the fearful drama lasted, and when at last the retainers of the baron, or, more properly, the robbers, were subdued, the sun had arose, throwing its beams over the scene of combat. Those who were not killed were securely bound. Among the latter was the baron, who was not taken without a stout resistance, and many imprecations against the leader of his captors. But they were of no avail; so the whole party started off with their prisoners towards the city, where their quarters were. Lizetta was mounted on one of the horses, for her lover resolved to take her to the city with him, the more effectually to protect her from danger, her father's house being a long distance off in the opposite direction. The trial of the baron and his men was soon in progression, when overwhelming evidence appeared, showing that he had been the leader of a band of robbers for several years. He was, consequently, sentenced to death, and a day was appointed for his execution. Previous to his execution, he made an attempt to escape, but was foiled in his design. Soon after, the remnant of his band, comprising those who were not in the melee recorded above, formed a desperate design of attempting his rescue, even on the scaffold. They were a band of reckless, daring marauders, whose delight was in danger, and they had a desperate purpose to effect. The morning appointed for the execution dawned, and at an early hour thousands came pouring in. The martial tread of the soldiers, the gilded trappings and gay caparisons of the steeds, and the waving of casques and plumes, gave the scene a feature of strange and thrilling interest. Scattered among the groups who surrounded the scaffold, were a party of men dressed in the habiliments of peasants of the interior, who would hardly have been noticed from the mass who surrounded them. But a keener scrutiny would have seen that they took more than a common interest in the scene. As the time drew near, they came in a body to the foot of the scaffold. Just then the clarions announced the approach of the procession. As the headsman and prisoner ascended the block, a shout burst from the multitude. The peasants threw off their outside garments, and disclosed a band of ferocious-looking men, armed to the teeth, who rushed on the soldiers, and a desperate conflict ensued. One robber, more gigantic than the rest, rushed on the scaffold, and bore the robber-baron off in his arms. The robbers fought with the bravery of despair, but were all killed or wounded to a man. The baron was recaptured, and again conveyed to the block. Then came the whizzing of the axe through the air, a rush of dark blood on the scaffold, and the robber-baron was no more. Lorando Ruric received the badge of knighthood, and when the war was ended, received a reward from the emperor for his services, besides the honor and esteem of the people. He was soon married to his beloved Lizetta, and they retired to a spacious mansion on the banks of the Lech, where her father lived with them. Here, in rural occupations, their lives passed in quiet happiness. THE END.</field>
