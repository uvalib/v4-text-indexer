Lea, of the said district, have deposited in this office the title of a book, the right whereof they claim as authors in the words following, to wit: “Logan, A Family History. Hear me, for I will speak.

CALDWELL, Clerk of the Eastern District of Pennsylvania</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PREFACE.—DEDICATION. I hate Prefaces. I hate Dedications. Enough for the one to say, that here is an American story; that the child of Logan was an American; that he was brave, wicked, and miserable, and that he and I are descendants from Logan the Mingo Chief. And for the other, the Dedication, I have just about as much, and no more to say. I do not dedicate my book to any body; for I know nobody worth dedicating it to. I have no friends, no children, no wife, no home;—no relations, no well-wishers;—nobody to love, and nobody to care for. To whom shall I; to whom can I dedicate it? To my Maker! It is unworthy of him. To my countrymen? They are unworthy of me. For the men of past ages I have very little veneration; for those of the present, none at all. To whom shall I entrust it? Who will care for me, by to-morrow? Who will do battle for my book, when I am gone? Will posterity? Yea, posterity will do me justice. To posterity then—to the winds!—I bequeath it! I devote it—as a Roman would his enemy, to the fierce and unsparing charities of another world—to a generation of spirits—to the shadowy and crowned potentates of hereafter. I—I—I have done—the blood of the red man is growing cold—farewell—farewell forever!—</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A 2 CHAPTER I. “Chi è costei'che mi parla? Una voce del cielo!... o, un demonio dell' inferno?.... I am better to day. Let me proceed. I have delayed this to the last moment. I am a wanderer, a rambler, a vagabond from my youth. I have drunk of more rivers than Chateaubriand. I have trodden more deserts than Bruce. I have suffered more deaths than Parke. And yet—I am dying, dying!—not of old age; not of disease; not among the nations that are called barbarous.—Gracious God! no! —but of want—of wretchedness—in the midst of abundance—among men of the same language—and of a broken heart. Yes, I am going. A few moments, and my spirit will be required of me. A few more sobs—a few more tears; a few more convulsive, audible palpitations of an old heart, and I am with my fathers, my brethren, and my children!—with all my tribe, and blood, and kindred—before the judgment seat of Almighty God. One moment! I pray thee—Before I go, I have a legacy for my land. That land! O! it rises, and shines, and wavers in the dimness of the past, all green and beautiful—O, my country!—Virginia! thou swimmest before mine eyes like some lonely, floating islet of heaven in the trance of a blind old man.—O, I could kneel to thee! All the blood of my nation, all that is left of it, is eddying round thy picture in my heart! * * * * * * * * * farewell! farewell! The sickly fluid of my white ancestors is already cold at my feet—I—I leave this testimony to thee! Blessed be the hand which receives it! thrice blessed that which preserves it! A part is the work of my strength, the revelry and riot of my boyhood—a part of my youth—a part of my decrepitude. The spirit of the red man hath been stirred up to voice and action. And lo! the white man hath quailed in the rebuke. * * * * * * * something beckons me. Farewell!—There is—it is not fancy—it is not the smoky dreaming of an old man—sightless and dying — O no! it is real. There is a great hand before me— a stern countenance behind—a loud voice approaching. Whence is that voice? Whither wouldst thou that I should journey? I understand thee. Ye are familiar to our race. It is the hand, and the forehead, and the voice of our great ancestor! They are portentous. But why that frown? Lo, I am coming—I am coming!— — — — — — — London.31st December, 1820.—Midnight.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER II. “Das Leben ist der Goetter licht; Der Uebel grösstes aber is die should— Evil!—Be thou my good.” The family of Logan, “The Mingo Chief,” is now extinct. The sun of their glory hath set in darkness. I myself have seen the last of that valiant race, the very last, descending majestically to the chambers of death. Who has not heard of Logan? Who cannot recount the deeds of his generation? Let us go together to the dwelling place of his spirit, and travel over the wild-blossoming earth that the children of Logan have trodden: bathe where they have bathed, in the cold blue water of the wilderness, and go a hunting with their shadows, in the dim breathless solitude. In one of the lower counties of Virginia, (one of the United States of North America,) there once lived— no matter when—it is not material to my story —a legitimate descendant of Logan, the great Indian Warrior. Logan had been `the friend of white men.' Who does not remember it? Suddenly, without provocation, or notice, this Indian patriarch, this Indian prince, in the very prime and vigour of his maturity, while about him sat his children and his children's children, and through ten thousand ruddy channels, the blood of the brave and good was rippling from the fountain of his being—in one moment, one little moment, he was smitten with barrenness and death. The shot rang, and many generations mingled their blood at his feet. All his hopes were prostrate. He was childless! He was no longer a father nor a husband. But a moment before, he had been the husband of many wives, and the father of a multitude. Now!—he was alone, alone in the wide world. The channels of immortality were cut asunder—its sources and fountains locked up and hidden—and the rich fluid of many hearts was turned aside to the unfruitful sand of the desert. `There is not one drop of my blood,' said Logan, `now running in the veins of a single human creature!' What desolation! `I would not turn on my heel,' said he, `to save my life.' Who does not believe him? `I took up the hatchet,' said Logan, `I was glutted with vengeance.' Verily he was glutted, and his son, and his son's sons have been glutted after him. Again Logan was a father. In wrath was his child begotten—in desperation, and in power. He was nourished with the blood of white men. From his very infancy, even while he was lashed to the tree-branch, and swung by the tempestuous wind, the scalp of many an enemy blackened and dried within his reach, and often were his little fingers reddened by the trophies torn, by the hand of his father, from the dying white man, and flung, yet fresh and reeking, into the basket that contained the boy. Logan's was the disposition and appetite of the parent vulture, that perches above her young and flaps over them, while their clotted beaks are searching into their first banquet of blood and flesh. He made his boy a warrior. He was born a chief. That done, the old man called a council of his nation, pronounced an awful malediction upon the whites, and disappeared forever. Such things have happened before. I know it. Lycurgus did much the same; but Logan had never heard of Lycurgus. The passing away of Numa too, was misterious and terrible; but of Numa, and even of Rome, `the commonwealth of kings.' Logan had never heard. No!—the feeling of Logan was that of the priesthood to his religion. He journeyed to the wilderness, to hold communion with the Great Spirit. He abandoned his tribe, why? Because the sinews of his youth were rigid; and the bow of his strength, no other man might bend. I have seen that bow, nay, I have it; I can lay my hand upon it this moment, by putting out my arm: but none of this generation can draw the arrow to the head. But Logan—he went, alone as I said, to the wilderness. He devoted himself, with the solemnity of one about to meet in convocation, the builders of his race; about to hearken to their denunciations upon him and his, in full and shadowy council assembled, for permiting the white men to profane their quiet and boundless heritage; and then!—to hear his pardon pronounced in the deep solitude, as with the voice of congregated kings, while he recounted the deeds that he had wrought in his old age, in battle and in blood, against the white man. He knelt—he laid down his child at the foot of an oak, that instant shattered and riven with the midnight thunderbolt, and prayed that the cloud might not pass over his head, unless it were to confirm his destiny, and render the hands of the babe that had dabbled in blood, yet more and more familiar with it as they waxed older and stronger. His prayer was heard. There was a dark commotion in the turbid blue sky, as of a host hurrying away, appeased and conciliated, by some tremendous rite. In one word, Logan abandoned his dominion, that his dominion might not abandon him. He left it—terrible as the sway of an evil spirit, that his son might be made to tread in his footsteps, while the fire of his heart was newly kindled; while the blood of his being was in its fiercest agitation; while his youthful ears were yet ringing with the curses of his father upon the encroaching white settler; and while his young spirit stood shivering, and appalled, at the mysterious disappearance of that fierce and implacable father. Thus much for two generations of Logan. The blood of this race was afterwards mingled with that of their white neighbours, and produced, in their remote descendants, a family neither Indian nor white; neither savage nor civilized. I knew them. The last time that I was in my country, I paid them a visit, and they all assembled to meet me—for—and why should I conceal it? I, myself, am of the same blood. There was in the males, the erect port, the lofty, reserved carriage, and the sullen, glistening, snaky black eye of the Indian; but the swarthy and deep, in tinctured hue of the native American had yielded to the hearty brown of the sturdy white settler; the strong and adventurous woodman. And in the females, there was little to betray their high origin, except their jetty black hair, and their exceedingly straight limbs, for their complexion was the warm, bright, voluptuous olive, of the young Spanish girl. In both, however, I have seen the blood reddening in the forehead; and the underlip quivering with emotion, in a manner that was never seen, never! in the unadulterated, undegenerate Indian. His face is bronze; his feelings, and the fountain thereof, undiscoverable; his nature inaccessible—its surface like that of frozen waters, unshaken alike by the tempestuous visitation of outward things; and revealing nought of the inward and perpetual agitation of their secret, and mysterious depths—forever placid—forever motionless! Passion only can move the Indian—and his motion then, is that of Death, which he breathes upon the heart of man, and it dissolves in silence. But then, then, wo to every living creature that crosses his path. His muscles are cracking with tension; a preternatural strength rushes from his heart, through all his struggling extremities; and he becomes, while, in appearance, as immoveable as the dark sculptured marble before you, literally and truly, a Devil! This family, the mother of which was the nearest blood descendant of the great Logan; and her supremacy was acknowledged with the deepest veneration, by all the neighbouring tribes, lived at this time in a little cabin, close by a clear and beautiful stream, a branch of the Shannandoah, which many years before had been turned out of its natural course, and dammed up by the beavers, so as almost to enclose the few acres of bright tufted green earth, on the very margin of which, the little Indian habitation nestled and cowered. It was not the English cottage, overrun with shining honeysuckle and vivid foliage; nor the Irish cabin, with bare walls, and floor of trodden earth; and still less was it the fantastic thatch-covered dwelling of the novelist, where brown bread and milk, cleanly scoured tables, and coarse napkins, and sheets `white as the driven snow,' are forever set out to the imagination. No! but it was far more picturesque than either. It was humble, and at a distance might have been taken for a green hillock, overrun with wild, flowering luxuriance, and shadowed, and fanned like a fountain, by the glittering birch and the waving branches of many a young tree that leant over it: on its walls of broken rock, through every crevice and cranny of which, bright transparent flowers, and tendrils, and vines were creeping, you would discover the implements of war—the tomahawk, the rifle, the bow and arrow—the fishing tackle, net and white bone hooks, game drying in the sun, the antlers of many a slain deer, the bear and panther skins, and the light airy canoe, all leaning, or lying about, or swinging in the wind, without order or design. In one word it was an Indian cottage; and looked like the natural growth of the wilderness, or the hermitage of some half spiritual creature, loving quiet and idleness, and shunning all the bustle and activity of the world. It was a green solitude, populous with life and beauty, only at the heart:—unapproachable to every evil thing, like some enchanted spot, surrounded by running water.[1] [1] It is singular that the North American Indian, the Highlander, and the Irish peasant, unite in the same notion, that evil spirits cannot cross running water. The mother of this family—how shall I describe her? She was an Indian queen, so stately, so natural, so magnificent! Clad in her flowing panther skin, with her quiver ringing at her shoulder; her feet sandalled; and resting upon her tall bow, she stood the express image of wild sovereignty, very beautiful, and full of power and grace. Her countenance was melancholy and serious; there was even something tender and touching in it, at times, as she turned her fine eyes towards her naked children, that lay basking about in the sunshine, and feathering their arrows, or sharpening their fish bones, and flints. The traces of high thought were visible upon her lofty forehead, and an occasional shadow passing over it, attended with a slight trembling, or a convulsive pressure of the lip, showed that her heart was labouring with deep emotion, at times. It was true—the spirit of the majestic woman was in perpetual travail for her people. The father—I feel my heart growing warm again, as I recall the dear, dear spot to my remembrance, and if I do not soon take my eyes from the picture that is, at this instant, assembling itself before me, limb by limb, and feature by feature, I shall grow sick at heart, weary of my appointed trial, and throw aside my pen forever, fainting in very wretchedness of spirit. But there is a cure for this—the father!—at his name I revive; my faculties arouse themselves. Let us talk of the father then; of him that never forgot nor forgave. What a sublime constancy! I will imitate him—I!—well then `the father.' He was a savage and untractable man, related, I remember to have heard in my youth, to a noble family in his native land; one, who, having run and rioted through every excess of indulgence, had, at last, turned his back forever upon the old world, and embarked for America—How did he this? With what spirit? Not, I am sure, with that of the young adventurer, braving death and terror in their very hiding places, the chambers of the ocean—Seeing cities under the wave, and diamonds studding the brown cliffs that he is approaching—no, oh no!—nothing of this: but with the cold, deadly, unforgiving misanthrophy of one, who, leaving all on earth that should bind him to it, turns in mockery of them that weep and shiver, as their heartstrings are tugged at, and shakes off the dust from his feet in scornful testimony against them,—snapping asunder every tie of sympathy and affection—every filament of brotherhood or love—every chord of judgment, habit or feeling—bruising with an iron hand, and breaking, as in derision, with profaning levity, the youngest and greenest tendrils of the heart, alike with the sinuous and gnarled roots of our toughest and most protracted habitudes—trampling on them all!—scorning them all!—scattering them all, without shame, or remorse, yea, without emotion! Such was the father; a savage before he left the palaces of white men. But he was a great savage. He had a desperate but sublime ambition. He was full of the fiery element, that rises in the arteries like mercury in a thermometer, at the approach of greatness. His whole nature was heroick—but it was the nature of him who thundered against the battlements of heaven. He came to the colonies in company with white men, solely because he could not man and navigate a ship over the broad Atlantic, with his own individual and solitary spirit. But the first moment he landed, the first moment that he touched the shores of the Western world, he adjured them all; he turned upon them, convulsively, and cursed them all in the bitterness of his heart—his name, and family, and kindred and country, nay, his very religion did he curse, for that he cried, even that was a religion of blood. He disappeared. For years it VOL. I. B was thought that he had perished, and he was almost forgotten; yet men would start at the mention of his name, and look hastily about them, before they ventured to repeat any of the innumerable and terrifick stories that were told of him. I heard them once—from savages—I was a boy then —but I never shall forget my awful admiration of the father, or the silent yearning of my heart towards the mother of this family. We were related—distantly, it is true, but so related, that our proximity could be seen in our very tread, and heard in our lowest whisper. Yes! there was never a descendant of Logan, no matter how his frame was distorted, his disposition perverted, or his blood diluted by relationship to the whites, that would not have been recognized and hailed as of that family, by the least sagacious of the tribe, even after many generations. But what became of this family? What! they were slaughtered—butchered, and profaned. Their end was mysterious. At midnight a traveller had reposed with them, eaten of their bread, and drunk of their cup—and his comrades, who followed upon his track before the next sun had risen, found the Indian cottage blazing and crackling—the walls demolished—the trees falling to ashes—and the skeletons of many hewed and bound and broken human creatures—some very little—and yet retaining the expression of agony, in their locked and rivetted limbs, slowly consuming in the fervent heat. Who were the murderers? It was never known—no mortal lip hath ever named them—but there was one, one even on this earth, whom they were never to escape; one who pursued them, sleeping and waking, by night and by day, with fire and sword, till his preternatural sagacity and wrath, were satisfied. And then —what became of him? He went mad—mad! and roamed for whole years through the impenetrable solitude, in quest of his beloved and her little ones. But let us leave this picture. My heart fails me; I cannot go on. Let me recur awhile to a manuscript of my own, and content myself with copying the incidents that are there related, with some of the reflections that grew out of them, while they were fresh and active in my remembrance, until I am more composed. The continuity of my narrative shall not be broken. It is a necessary part of the same `Family History.' `One day, while the middle colonies were agitated to distraction by the increasing inroads and massacres of the warlike and exasperated Indians; when every thing (it was said) had been attempted that human wisdom could suggest, to conciliate them; and just at the time when the existence of a formidable and threatening confederacy, between all the most powerful tribes in America, was becoming, every day, more and more probable; when every hour was bringing to light, and concentrating the scattered proof, that something tremendous was in contemplation—inscrutable and inevitable— some unimaginable but overwhelming evil—maturing in the portentous tranquillity of many nations, who, from being hereditary and mortal foes, were now holding their midnight councils in the deepest and most unfathomable recesses of the country—in the lone cavern—on the high mountain top—by the shores of a cold lake; while all was consternation and dismay, from uncertainty concerning the manner and time of the mysterious calamity, that seemed thickening about them; when council after council had been summoned and dismissed, by the white settlers, without coming to any satisfactory determination; while the uninterrupted and useless expenditure of warlike stores, at all times dangerous to the whites, had been unwisely augmented, in the hope of buying the forbearance of the Indians, till the blindest and weakest were shuddering at the consequences of their pusillanimity and shortsightedness; while the savages grew every day more familiar with the timidity and disorder of the whites; carefully evading all interrogations, and baffling all conjecture, by their sullen, shrewd and obstinate silence, and nothing seemed left to the scattered and trembling colonists, but to muster themselves, every man of them, capable of wielding a tomahawk, for a war of extermination; to concentrate their power, leave their fire-sides undefended for a time, and hunt their wily and terrible enemy back to his most secret hiding places—— just at this time—it was midnight—another council board had just been dimissed—there stood, without being announced, without preparation, before the governour of the colony—in his very presence chamber too, a man of gigantic stature, in the garb of an Indian. The governour was leaning his face upon his hands— his thin gray locks were blowing about his fingers, in the strong night wind, from an open window that looked towards the town. That he was in some profound and agitating inquiry with himself, inwardly, could be seen, by the movement of the swollen veins upon his forehead, distended and throbbing visibly under the pressure of his aged fingers. The whole picture was a noble one; it would have made the heart of such a being as Michael Angelo himself, swell, to have studied the head of the old man:—The capacity and amplitude of the brow—the scattered and beautiful white, thin locks of threaded silver; the trembling hands; the occasional movement of a troubled expression, almost articulate, over the established serenity of the forehead —all so venerable, placid, and awful, as in the confirmed discipline and habit of many years, and all yielding now, to the convulsive encroachment of emotion. Reader, didst thou never see an old man—a good and great one—weep? Then have thy feelings, thy heart and soul, nay, thy very religion, escaped their severest trial. The stranger contemplated the picture in silence. He was greatly wrought upon by the aged presence, and felt, perhaps, somewhat as the profaning Gaul did, when he saw, what he took to be the Gods of Rome, her old men, sitting immoveably in their chairs. The governour, at length, like one who is determined, resolved, and impatient for action, lifted his head, smote the table heavily with his arm, and was rising from his seat—why that pause!—He gasps for breath —can it be—can the proportions, the mere outline of humanity so disturb a man, an aged man too, a good one, familiar, for half a century with danger and death? He fell back upon his chair, and locked his hands upon his heart, as if, for it grew audible in its hollow palpitations—as if, to stifle its irregularity forever—if he could, even though he himself were suffocated in the effort, rather than betray the unmanly infirmity—a disobedient pulse. He gazed steadily upon the being before him, but with an expression of doubt and horror, like that with which the prophet dwelt upon the sheeted Samuel, as doubting the evidence of his own eyes, yet daring not to withdraw them, though the cold icy sweat started from the very ends of his fingers, lest something yet more terrible might appear. The Indian stood before him like an apparition. His attitude (it is worth describing—for it was very peculiar) was not entirely natural, nor perhaps entirely unstudied. He stood motionless and apalling; the bleak, barren, and iron aspect of a man, from head to foot strong and sinewed with desperation, and hardened in the blood and sweat of calamity and trial. He stood with somewhat of high and princely carriage—like the fighting gladiator—but more erect and less threatening —more prepared and collected. Indeed it was the gladiator still—but the gladiator in defence, rather than attack. The governour was brave, but who would not have quaked at such a moment? To awake, no matter how, when the faculties, or the body and limbs are asleep, in a dim light—alone—helpless—and to find a man at your side—an Indian!—it would shake the nerves, ay, and the constitution too, of the bravest man that ever buckled a sword upon his thigh. “Great God!' articulated the governour at last—in the voice of one suffocating and gasping—`Great God!— what art thou?—Speak!' No answer was returned—no motion of head or hand. The governour's terror increased, but it was evidently of a different kind now, the first shock of surprise having passed—`Speak!' he added in a tone of command —`Speak! How were you admitted? and for what?' A scornful writhing of the lip; a sullen, deadly and inward smile, as in derision, when the bitterness of the heart rises and is tasted, was the prelude to his answer —a pause—the Indian was agitated—but the agitation passed off like the vibration of molten iron when it B 2 trembles for the last time before it becomes solid forever. Then he smiled! That was his answer, that! The old man grew delirious on the spot—he raved and tore his hair. In the name of Heaven, what shook his frame so suddenly? And the Indian—look at him! hear him!—breathing out, at long intervals, like a hot and smoking war-horse, —his eyes rooted, flaming and motionless—the old man shivering from head to foot; rage, indignation, horror, and madness in his countenance, and feebleness in his frame—his spirit rebuking the weakness of his body, and a preternatural voice struggling in his chest. `Hell and furies! who are you!—what are you!— whence are you?—what your purpose? Speak!—would you murder me?—Murder me, if you will! but speak!— Speak!—in mercy, speak to me!'—were the rapidly uttered words of the governour, as he gradually relapsed. He covered his face with his hands, and groaned aloud. Surely the fear of death, surely that could not so work upon him—`Speak! he resumed again, raising his head, and uttering his voice in a transport of delirious agony —`Oh George! speak to me, I pray thee—how came thee here?—art thou George of Salisbury or not?— who gave thee admittance?” The Indian slowly unwrapped his blanket, and then as slowly, in barbarous dalliance with the terrors of the palsied old man, extended a bayonet towards him, reeking with blood. The governour was silent. It was a fearful moment. His paroxysm appeared to abate at his will now—and by his manner it would appear that some master-thought had suddenly risen in its dominion, and bound hand and foot all the rebellious and warring passions of his nature. Did he hope for succour? or did he look, by gaining time to some indefinite advantage by negociation? It would be difficult to tell. But however it might be, his deportment became more worthy of him, more lofty, collected, imposing, and determined. Such is the office of extreme peril. In desperate emergencies, our souls grow calm, and a power is given to them to gaze, as dying men will sometimes, upon the shoreless void before them, with preternatural composure. Here was an enemy, and one, of all enemies the most terrible, dripping with recent slaughter, and so situated that he could not escape, but by dipping his hands anew in blood. The governour dared not to call out, and dreaded, as the signal of his own death, the sound of any approaching footstep. To get there, where he was, the Indian must have come, willing and prepared for, and expecting certain death; of what avail then, the whole force of the government household? He attempted to prepare himself to pray; but he could not. He but shook and trembled the more, as he became more and more sensible of the necessity there was, that, to prepare himself, he should be calm and assured. The hot sweat rolled from his forehead like rain. For a moment he would seem to give up entirely; and then he would address his silent and awful visitor with a feeble voice, almost of supplication— soothingly and mildly, till the words would rattle and die away in his chest, and then!—maddening with the cause of his imbecility, in silence and dread, he would lock his withered hands, raise them to heaven, and call down curses upon the collossal Indian, with all the violence and passion of intemperate boyhood—his voice would grow fainter and fainter; he would become almost inarticulate, and the sounds would die away at last in a denouncing malediction, that seemed to freeze his own blood as he breathed it. Who would not have maddened? To be a governour —a commander in chief, with the whole disposable force of a large colony at one's bidding; and yet, to be living and breathing only at the mercy of a single Indian! It was indeed too much for human patience! He could have driven a dagger through his own heart for relief. There was a sword near the governour; he recollected having unbuckled it, and thrown it aside, as he came in from exercising a troop of horse, but a few hours before the council had assembled. `It was in a chair behind me,' thought he, and `perhaps, is there yet'— But how should he discover whether it was or not? He dares not shift his eye for a single instant from the Indian. But, might he not amuse him for a moment, and grope for it, without being perceived? How bravely the old man's spirit mounted in the endeavour! He made the search: but his implacable foe, like one that delights in toying and trifling with, and mocking his victim, permitted the eager and trembling hand but to touch the hilt, not to grasp it—that were not so prudent, in the wrath of a desperate man, a soldier, and a veteran. The moment therefore, that the searching fingers approached the hilt, the blanket fell from the shoulders of the Indian, and the bloody bayonet gleamed suddenly athwart the ceiling and flashed in the governour's eyes. The hand was withdrawn, as if smitten with electricity, from the distant sword; all defence and hope forgotten, and the old man locked his thin hands upon his bosom, bowed his head to the expected sacrifice, and fell upon his knees. The countenance of the Indian could not be seen, but his solid proportions, like a block of shadow, could be distinguished in the uncertain light of the distant and dying lamps, suspended from the ceiling—a bold, great outline and sublime bearing, the more awful for their indistinctness; the more appalling as they resembled those of a colossal shadow only. Like Sampson himself, he stood, when about to heave the temple, and pluck down the whole power of the Philistines upon his own head; accumulating his wrath, husbanding and concentrating his might, and preparing his shoulders, for their last, last burden of shame and oppression. At this instant, a red light flashed across the court yard, and streaming through the open window, touched the countenance of the Indian, and passed off like the reflection of crimson drapery, suddenly illuminated by lightening; voices were heard in a distant building, and iron hoofs rattled over the broad flag stones of the far gate way. A few brief words were interchanged and a shot was fired;—the Indian's hand was upon the bayonet again,—but the sounds passed away with the same ceremony; and the prostrate governour, who had kept an anxious eye upon the heavy doors of the hall, inwardly expecting, yet scarcely daring to pray for an approaching step, was beginning to yield anew to his terrible fate—when another step was heard, and a hand was laid upon the lock. The rattling of military accoutrements was heard, as the guard stepped aside and gave a countersign to some one approaching; and then, a brief and stern echo, in the tone of unqualified authority rang along the vaulted stair case, and the word pass! was heard. Yes, yes! a hand was now upon the lock! The light in the apartment streamed fitfully up for a moment, and flared in the breeze from the window, so as to fill the whole room with shifting shadows. The Indian motioned impatiently with his hand toward the door, and the governour, while his heart sank within him, arose on his feet and prepared to repel the intruder, whoever he might be—but he could not speak—his voice had gone— The door was yielding to the hurried attempts of some one fumbling about for the lock:—and voices, in distant and clamorous dispute, were heard approaching. The governour tried again—`Begone!—begone!—for God's sake!' he cried, mingling the tone of habitual command with that of entreaty—and then, recovering himself, with a feeling of shame, he added, in his most natural and assured manner, `begone, whoever you are, begone!' The noise ceased. The hand was withdrawn; and step by step, with the solid and prompt tread of a strong man, a soldier, in his youth, and accustomed to obedience, the intruder was heard descending. There was another long, long silence, which each seemed unwilling to interrupt, while each numbered the departing footfalls. The chamber grew dark. It was impossible longer to distinguish the objects in the room. A low conference was held between the two. Tones of angry remonstrance, horror—threats—defiance—suppressed anguish—and then all was silent again as the house of death. The governour spoke again—in a whisper at first, and then louder—a slight motion was heard near him—and he raised his voice. In vain, and the mysterious and death like silence, he found more insupportable than all that he had yet endured. Where was his foe at that instant?—how employed?—ready perhaps, to strike the bayonet through and through his heart, at the very next breath! He could not endure it—no mortal could—he uttered a loud cry, and fell upon his face in convulsions.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER III. “What art thou?—Speak!” The sentinel at the door heard the cry, and though a strong muscular man, capable of resisting, singly, a legion of devils, in the narrow landing where he was placed, yet was he so possessed with the notion that whatever was unaccountable, was some Indian plot, some Indian stratagem, which no wisdom or foresight could baffle or resist, (and this terror he had in common with all the whites at the time,) that he had neither the strength, nor the presence of mind to give the alarm by firing off his musquet; but echoing, with a preternatural loudness, like a wounded man, the cry of the governour, he staggered forward, cleared the platform at one bound; jumped at once from the very top, to the very bottom of the council stairs, and ran towards the nearest block house, yelling all the way, in a voice rendered doubly thrilling and piercing from terror, `murder!—murder!—To arms!—Indians!—Indians! to arms!' All the town was in an uproar. The drums beat— straggling shots were fired, and lights were seen streaming quickly past the windows of every house, far and near, as the terrified, half naked women, with their babes in their arms, were hurrying to and fro, and shrieking in consternation. The governour had been constantly expecting, and, as far as human sagacity would permit, providing for a surprise. His vigilance had been especially quickened, during the few last days, from observing a number of Indian chiefs and warriors, whose fidelity he had some reason to distrust, or rather of whose fidelity he had no reason to be certain, that had been accumulating about him, under pretence of negotiation for certain lands. The preparations of the governour could not be carried on in secrecy, and the personal superintendence that he had given of late to the military defence of the town, had aggravated, instead of allaying the terrors of the poor people, till the sound of a single shot, or the cry of a single dog, was ready to be mistaken for the innumerable rifles, and denouncing war whoop of the savage. At this moment therefore, the deepest midnight, when all hearts, apparently exhausted by excess of watchfulness and anxiety, had sunk into a profound repose, it is not wonderful that the sound of straggling shot, and the cry of `to arms! to arms!' should ring in their ears like the blast of a trumpet announcing the day of judgment. Lights were kindled, beacons—and women and children were seen flying from one house to another, as to successive assylums, while their husbands were assembling and fortifying the strongest for their reception. On the soldiers, however, no dependence could be placed. They had no leader—no rallying point. The only man for whose military abilities they felt any respect, was the governour, and he was not to be found. Their mode of fighting had always been, to choose, each man a tree for himself, and to fire as fast as he could, at any thing he chose. But that mode would not do here. They were to act in concert, and successively, so as to relieve each other, if the enemy attempted, as he undoubtedly would, to storm and set fire to the works. In the mean time, the women and children, to whom the block houses were appointed places of refuge, in every alarm, were approaching from all quarters; every house they gained bringing them nearer, and sheltering them for a awhile, in their approach to their place of final security. And this they did, without injury or molestation, for some time, in the face of a continual squibbing from the loop holes of the log fort, by the terrified and hasty soldiery. Luckily for the poor creatures, running hither and thither with hair and clothes flying, and their youngest babes huddled to their hearts, as if the scalping knife were already at their foreheads, it was soon found on inspection, that not a few of the musquets had been fired with blank cartridges; and the very little waste of ammunition, with a good deal of loose trodden powder upon the floor, and the frequent brief whistle of the pieces when discharged, led some to the natural conclusion, that many of the musquets had not even been charged with powder, but only primed, and let off in their trepidation. The panick increased, and the fugitives were actually fired upon, at last, with a deliberate intent. The soldiers having forgotten, it would seem, that the block houses were constructed for no other purpose than the protection of the women and children, all at once took it into their heads, that this was only a new stratagem of the enemy, and that the terrified creatures who were coming in under the rain and fire of their riflemen, desperate from excess of terror, were savages in disguise. Thus believed, and thus acted the garrison for a time, while the poor sufferers themselves, denied admittance and fired upon by their husbands and brothers, believed, in their turn, that the Indians had got possession of the block house. They turned and fled!—fled, wringing their hands and shrieking, distractedly, towards the wood. The garrison were confirmed in their first belief by this movement, and thinking that they had repulsed the enemy, set up a shout of triumph, and prepared to follow them, but were deterred by the timely suggestion, that even this might be but a more capital trick to decoy them from their entrenchments. Their shouts, however, had the effect of accelerating the flight of their wives and little ones. Thus the terror of a midnight alarm, came nigh depopulating a beautiful little village, making fathers and husbands the murderers of all that they loved on earth. Heaven only knows what might have been the consequence, had the Indians that were really about, been prepared to take advantage of their panick. The women and children would probably have been butchered between friend and foe, like our troops on Long Island, in the late war of the revolution. Wonderful as it may seem, to the inexperienced in matters of this sort, yet it is nevertheless a fact, to be paralleled I dare say, in the recollection of every soldier who has seen actual service, that during the heat and hurry of this alarm, a whole platoon of good marksmen took deliberate aim, and fired point blank at their comrade, (him that was the cause of the whole uproar) as he approached, shouting to them that the Indians were upon them! and missed him. This, to their blind and deafened faculties, was another stratagem! And really, there was enough to justify this ludicrous apprehension at the most simple affair. The whites, in their first warlike expeditions against the natives, had become so cruelly entrapped by the simplest expedients, that they doubted and distrusted every thing. Even in battle, if they were victorious, and the enemy fled, they dared not pursue; and if he cried quarter, they were often puzzled to determine whether it were safest to take his life or give it to him, and this too, in the fear of some deep laid and inscrutable trick. It was a warfare of duplicity and resource between the two. Every thing was a stratagem—every thing. If succour came, they watched its approach with dismay, and felt hardly secure, until they had felt the faces and hands of them that came, and assured themselves that they were not red men disguised; and so too, if capitulation was proposed and accepted, they dared not profit by it. The messenger of terror finding this unexpected reception from his comrades, had still enough of natural instinct left, to turn aside for the woods, and conceal himself awhile. At last the panick began to subside. No Indians appeared. VOL. I. C Could this be a new trick? A long silence followed; light after light, left burning in the windows of the deserted cottages, went out—and all was breathless, patient expectation. A few low whispers were first heard—they grew louder and more frequent—until, at last, the whole garrison fell a talking, in the full possession of their senses. `What was it?' said one, who first broke the silence, in a timid voice, to his companion. `Did you see plain? was it really an Indian?' `What! did'nt you see him!' `Not I faith!' said the first. `Nor I!'—was the answer—`I saw no Indian.' Nor I! nor I! nor I! resounded at once on all sides, and `damme,' cried one in a loud voice, as if just catching his breath, `damme! if I believe it was an Indian at all.' `I thought,'—said one, doubtfully—and as if half afraid to say what he thought—`I thought that—it looked—like—Fred—' `Like Fred!—Fred who?'— `Why corporal Fred to be sure!'— The answer thrilled through the whole garrison like electricity—they all hung their heads in silence. `Poor fellow!' cried one, at last, with a sigh that was almost a sob, `thank God! I had no hand in his death!' `You!' said his comrade, `why, you fired at him.' `No, but I did'nt though!' answered the other, turning away sullenly, and comforting himself, by driving his rammer home, and showing that his piece was yet loaded. `Yes!' cried another, `yes, comrades, it was poor Fred—and we have done the job for him—it must have been him.' `It was! it was!' said another, who had not yet spoken. `I knew his voice.'— `You knew his voice, and be damned to you!—you did! Then what the devil did you shoot him for? You fired the first shot—Did'nt he comrades?' The speaker was silent. His example was successively followed by all the garrison. Each felt that he had blood upon his hands—the blood of a comrade, and while each was ignorant of the danger that beset him, he dared not leave his concealment, to ascertain whether the object of all their anxiety was really a dead man or not. It became profoundly still abroad. The rippling of the water that ran a long way off, against the margin of woven willow tresses could be heard; and an occasional glimmer could be seen, of some torch carried along the verge of the distant wood, or revealed by the undulations of the ground, over which some of the weaker and older of the fugitives were tottering; for all took especial care, as most people do in a time of terror, to do exactly that which was least beneficial and most perilous, and most inexplicable by the common laws of our nature in a time of tranquillity. They were all afraid of darkness! more afraid of Indians, and yet each took a torch and fled screaming, and scampering about the woods, a perpetual mark for the rifles and tomahawks that they believed were in ambush for their destruction. `But the governor!'—`gracious heaven, where is he?' —`who knows? who can tell?'—these were now the reiterated and anxious inquiries of the garrison. All loved the old man, and every one of them had sworn a thousand times, that he would die a thousand deaths for the governor. Butthen—would it be prudent just at this time? soldiers were scarce. The block house must be defended: and then, `those lights yonder'—they were no laughing matter, of a dark night:—`very suspicious,' and for his soul, not one of the garrison could bring himself to like them, as they shifted about, here and there, in the scattered foliage of the nearest wood.— Besides, the block house was the post of danger;— that had been generally admitted;—and they, as gallant men, were bound to stay there, particularly as the alarm might possibly arise again before morning. The better and more manly feelings of their nature, at length began to prevail over these dastardly suggestions, of what they, being in danger and darkness, called prudence, and a party of the most desperate were finally fitted out, and despatched, to bring in the governor dead or alive. But first, it was stipulated, with a becoming caution, that they should not be mistaken for Indians, nor fired upon, under any pretence whatever, though they should see fit to return in some confusion; and the better to secure the faithful performance of this provision in the treaty, the forlorn hope (as they considered themselves) were seriously inclined to take with them all the ball cartridges of the garrison. From this scheme, however, they were finally dissuaded by the ingenious suggestion of a veteran, who proposed that all the soldiers within the block house, should give their word of honour to load, if they loaded at all, and fire, if they should see fit to fire at all, without ball, during the absence of their comrades. This momentous affair, thus happily brought to a conclusion, hands and blessings were interchanged with appalling emphasis, and the detachment took up their line of march in close order for the council chamber. It was very dark, and not a little difficulty occurred in settling questions of precedence for rear and van; as all, even the bravest of the band, seemed especially desirous of being in the middle. They arrived successively, at the court yard—the broad entrance—the landing, `no challenge!'—what could this mean? where was the sentry? They came to a narrow and difficult passage, the only access from this quarter to the council chamber; as the main door caught within by a spring lock, and had been flung back with such force, by the terrified soldier who had given the alarm, as to catch. `Holloa!—who's this?' cried one of the party, `here,' while he stumbled over a body---a cold shudder ran along the arteries of the whole detachment at the sound of his voice, and the dead heavy tumble that accompanied it. They crowded together tumultuously, and found the cause of the exclamation. It was the body of a man. They raised it. It was cold and stiff, and the clothing was drenched and adhesive to the touch with something that shook those whose naked hands had encountered it, with unutterable horror. It was their comrade! He was dead—stabbed to the heart, weltering in his own thick blood!---his features livid and ghastly, and his blood-shot eyes staring with that terrible expression which shows you that the muscles, and flesh, and features of the murdered man grew solid at the very instant that he felt the broad dagger slowly pushing through and through his heart:—the retreating chest—the gasping mouth—the swollen tongue—the naked teeth, and the convulsed lip---Oh God! oh, God! who can ever forget the countenance of one that has been murdered, stabbed to death with a knife, and left to stiffen in the horrible convulsions of his last agony!---helpless!---voiceless!---his eyes bursting---his muscles and sinews curling and knotting together like crushed serpents! There was a long, long, inward and silent shuddering of the whole band, as the lifeless body dropped down again upon the floor, the moment that the light flashed upon it, and he who had borne it thus far, reeled and staggered away pale and trembling, and sick with instinctive terrour and loathing. But their errand—the governor! Instantly, and as with one voice, they all uttered a cry of `forward! forward!' and rushed towards the council chamber. The Indians were forgotten! their dead comrade forgotten! timidity, danger, death, cowardice, were forgotten! And they pressed up the stair-case with the vehement onset of children to the rescue of their father—careless of life, prodigal and reckless of all that they had habitually cherished, treasured, or feared. They burst through the door: no time for parley now, none for ceremony. One universal crash and cry accompanied them. It was awfully dark within the great chamber; silent too, silent as the grave. A moment's intermission would have been fatal to their fierce and overwrought excitement, and they would have stood shaking in every joint like victims huddled to the slaughter. `Lights! lights!—' were now thought of, and called for. They had been forgotten, and the only lamp that now burnt within this large edifice was that to which they had pulled the dead body a few minutes before, and that was chained to the ceiling. The end only C 2 had been in view; the means were overlooked. Some ran away for lights, glad of an excuse to be in the cool air again, even at the risk of passing the dead body alone, and all utterly forgetful, or regardless of the probability that the same hand, which had made one of their number lifeless, might be near, and even then at that moment, uplifted in darkness and silence, and ready to repeat the blow upon whomsoever should approach sufficiently near. Others began feeling about the floor with naked hands, in the fear of touching blood, or some other mortal evidence that the assassin had been there also. Happily there was no such testimonial of his presence. While they were thus occupied, some at the windows waiting for the distant and approaching lights, others keeping down their terror, by huddling in a corner, and holding strongly by each other's hands—a groan was heard!—a deep drawn, half stifled groan, as of one who had reasons for his concealment, and could hold his breath no longer. It was near them, but where? above or below? To the right hand or to the left? who could say? The effect was, as if an articulate summons had called each man, by name, to the chambers of death. The room was instantly cleared. The tide of adventure was in its ebb now: The star waned; and the pendulum which had just swung to the extremity of daring, had recoiled, and was rapidly approaching the line of cowardice. At a single moan, more than half of those who had burst into the room in a gush of surpassing heroism, were now tumbling over each other, from the top to the bottom of the stairs. A rapid, strong step now approached, and a fierce voice sounded, growing louder and louder at every word, as it came nearer and nearer, contending with, and driving back the fugitives. `Back, back!—Shame on ye! ye sneaking, damnable cowards! Back with ye, back!'—cried the new comer, leaping forward at the same moment, with a naked sword in his hand and several torches blazing behind him, and streaming along the blade from hilt to point, as it shook and quivered in his agitated hand—`Back, back!' he repeated, his voice ringing like a trumpet upon the ear, striking this way, and that, and thrusting and kicking the scoundrel crew, and driving them all before him—`Were all the Indians in Hell here, we are men enough for them, if we stick together! Back, back, I say!---no skulking---lug out your bayonets, and forward, like men; what!---afraid!—bring that fellow along here—there!—down with him, throw him over the railing—over with him! That's right— never mind his kicking!—over with him!'—It was done--- Their comrade was tumbled over the stair-case in the twinkling of an eye, and the stranger continued—`Now look ye, my boys, Indians, or no Indians, you must on: on with you! no faltering, or by the living God, if I catch another of you creeping or skulking, I'll drive this---- this! (shaking his sword in the red flare of the torches) this up to the hilt in his heart.' Disobedience here was out of the question. There was more peril behind than before, and the poor wretches were speedily prepared for storming the unknown enemy again, in spite of their mortal terror. They obeyed, blinded and deafened and shuddering at the terrible voice. The lights now reddened and streaked the walls, and, as they fell successively along the faces of the crowded and frightened party, in the deep thick shadow of the passage, each started, shuddered, and threw a hasty glance upon the countenance nearest him, as dreading to encounter something less welcome than the familiar visage of a comrade, and anxious to know what kind of acquaintances he has been making in silence and darkness:—But all at once, they united in one overpowering shout! as they recognised the stranger, who had so suddenly and imperiously taken command.—Again and again, they shouted! as they gathered round him, delighted, and wondering that they had not known his voice at first.—But that voice was unknown to them, well as they knew him—it was the voice of the thunder in its rebuke—the voice of blasphemy that is sometimes heard in the tempest, at midnight—it was a more than mortal voice, and reserved by the stranger for hours of spoil and carnage, when the trumpet rang not, and thrilled not through every heart and bone, like this, his own single, individual, and rending cry of encouragement and denunciation. `Hurra! for Harold,' they cried; `Hurra! Hurra!—' The stranger was young---aspect swarthy---very black hair, and countenance full of settled intensity. He snatched one of the torches and traversed the wide and silent apartment in every direction, looking to see the body of the murdered governor in every shadow, or the murderer himself emerge from every deep niche, or massy fold of the crimson drapery that partially canopied and festooned the hall. A sudden change of the wind blew the light in a contrary direction, and showed the object of their search, the old man upon his face, beneath the council board. A cry of horror, convulsive and tremulous, instantly broke from the pale lips of all who were near enough to see the body—But Harold---he was upon his knees beside it, with the celerity of thought---; a sound as of muttered curses was dropping sullenly and continually from his quivering lips, while his cheek flashed with the fiercest red, and then grew livid and death-like at every breath; with one blow of his foot, he overthrew the great table, and all its accumulated rubbish; raised the body in his arms, examined with a hasty and trembling hand the clothes, uttering continually the same unintelligible sound, with a frightful earnestness of manner. Then he tore open the shirt, pressed his shaking hand again and again upon the heart, knelt down and laid his ear to it, while the cold sweat fell from his forehead upon the naked bosom of the old man, as he appeared to weep and listen for some assurance of vitality. `No blood!---none, thank God!'---`no, no, no blood,' he articulated, at intervals, as he pursued the inquiry with hurried hands, and as it ended, straining the body to him, and hiding his face in the bosom, while his chest heaved, and his limbs shook, in the mortal silence that followed. After a few moments, and no earthly frame could have endured such agitation for more than a few moments, he arose, with a countenance settled and deathstruck, tottering and feeble as if from a paroxsym of horror and grief. His lips moved, and he strove again and again, as he raised his hand with the action of one about to issue a command, and let it fall again, as forgetting his purpose, to address some words to his men. In vain! He could not speak! And while all pressed forward with the deepest expression of sympathy and obedience, he was only able to wave them back, while he passed one hand slowly over his eyes, and stood for a few moments as if striving to recollect some painful thou ht that had been before him in his agony. His countenance changed. It grew stern and high. The thought came back to him, and the blood coloured his forehead again, as he gradually recovered his strength, and took his firm station by the side of the body, with the high bearing of one about to sit in judgment upon his fellow men, for life and death. He turned slowly around, surveying the whole detachment, and measuring them, man by man, with his penetrating black eye, from head to foot. `Whose turn was it to mount guard to-night?' said he. `At the platform? sir,' said some one with a faint voice. `No! at the landing.' `Fred, Sir, Corporal Fred, Sir,' answered another voice. `Where is he? I do not see him among you. `Is he here?' A dead silence followed. Nobody was willing to confess that he had fired, in a panick, upon his comrade. `What am I to understand by this silence? If any man among you know where he is, or what has become of him, let him speak.—what! no answer;—on your lives, I charge you—(his tones grew deeper, in the struggle that followed, and he spoke once more, in the voice of battle, as if all the blood of his body till that moment curdling about his heart, had suddenly shot through all his arteries with the velocity of light) `on your lives!' and his sword glittered before their eyes, as they quailed and retreated in terror—`on your lives, speak!—who manned the passage?' `Robert, Sir, Robert, Robert!—We passed over him! That was he. The dead body, Sir,' answered several voices at once. `Sergeant,' said Harold, with a solemn and determined countenance, that portended naught of kindness or forgiveness—`take a file of men with you. Go to the garrison—search every house—ransack it from garret to cellar—send out the rangers—scour the woods, and bring me in the body of Frederick Brown, dead or alive.' Several of the nearest soldiers here started from their ranks, either from eagerness to obey, or from a very natural wish to escape a further examination. `Stop, my lads,' said Harold, arresting them with a voice that was not to be disputed. `Stop! I have not done with you yet. Corporal, form your men. Serjeant, lead out your file upon the landing, and wait the order. Are your pieces loaded?' A stammering, faltering `yes,' uttered in a low whisper, betrayed the working of this preparation upon some of the men. Harold came directly in front of one that had answered in the affirmative, his brows knit, and his lips firmly pressed together. It was evident that his suspicions were aroused, and that he was determined to make an example of some one. `Order your piece, Sir,' said he, to the trembling soldier. `Down with your rammer.' The man obeyed—The rammer sounded—the musket rang, and Harold's face grew black with the wrath of his unsparing nature. `Lay down your arms, sir; serjeant, take him away!' The order was instantly obeyed. Some murmuring was heard, however, which Harold disdained to notice, until he saw the serjeant himself faltering in his duty, and the men working themselves into the shadow. That was enough! `Take your post there, sir, said Harold. Try your pieces! Load! Now sir! form your ranks!'---They obeyed. `And now, look ye, sir, if you see a man move from the line, put a ball through his head. Bring him down. No whimpering, no flinching,' he added, drawing a pistol from his belt, and cocking it—`no muttering, sir, comrade or no comrade, when I give you the signal, if you don't do it, I'll put a ball through your own.' He was proceeding in this way, man by man, finding about one piece out of five loaded, when a figure was seen stealing cautiously along one of the distant walls. `Who goes there,' cried Harold. No answer was returned, and the figure appeared to quicken his tread, with especial earnestness, at the sound of the voice. `Gracious Heaven!' cried one, in a half audible whisper, `it looks like poor Fred.' A cold shudder followed. Harold turned, and the speaker actually withered and shrunk. `Come hither, sir!' said Harold, again—at the same moment giving a signal to the serjeant, who instantly levelled his piece, and was followed by four others. The person, whoever it was, stopped and hesitated for a moment, but hearing the impatient whistle of Harold's blade, as he plucked it anew from its scabbard, he turned towards the broad stair-case, and leaped over the railing. `Fire!' cried Harold. The muskets rang; the house was filled with smoke and noise, and the balls rattled about the stone arches and stair-case, like hail, during the reverberations that followed. Harold instantly leaped forward, and threw himself upon a powerful fellow, whom he found escaping. The moment that he felt the impetuous onset of Harold, his spirit and design both seemed to forsake him, and he fell upon his kness. Harold held him by the throat, with the strength of a lion, till the torches were gleaming again upon the bright barrels of the musquetry, and blazing upon the countenance of the stranger—who looked, as if doubting whether he were alive or dead, and wondering what was next to happen. `Hell and the Devil, man, is it you?' cried Harold, as the light showed him the face of his ignoble prisoner—and he hurled him from him, to the furthest extremity of the vaulted entrance. `Take him, serjeant, take him with you.' `Nay, stop, stop!' he added, with the look of sudden recollection, and collaring the slave—`Come with me, come! and he dragged him into the council chamber, and led him, shaking in every limb, with his knees knocking together, to the body of the good old man. `Look there, sir—there! nay, don't turn away your eyes. That is your work!—and yours! and yours! and yours!' he added—tears, hot, scalding tears, starting from his eyes—`Your work! ye cowardly rascals—you soldiers! you! By the great God of heaven and earth ye are cowards! women! the vilest and most execrable of cowards!' `Begone,' he added, at length, with a violent effort, wiping the sweat from his forehead, and hurling from him, with the strength of an exasperated giant, the miserable wretch that was quaking in his grasp. `Begone!' said he, `and find your musket, and mark me; you were on duty. If there be a ball in it now, you are a dead man. Go with him Henderson, and you Roberts, and see that it is brought to me as it is found.' They departed; and Harold turned once more, in the grief and consternation of his heart, to the cold and lifeless body of the veteran before him, sacrificed by the cowardly misconduct of his own guard perhaps, and yet, how slain? that was a mystery. There was no blood, no wound visible. Harold threw himself again by the body, examined it again—a passionate burst of tears followed—he fell upon it, and sobbed aloud. `Oh, my father! my father! where was I in this thine extremity? Where was Harold!' Who would not have wept with him? They did weep, they wept aloud; even, they who hated and feared him, they wept. A sound, the lamentation, of strong hearts, the grief and wailing of men—it is not often heard, but when it is, there is no sound of sorrow like it; so moving, so subduing, so irresistible. `Help me,' he cried, `help me!—away to the garrison—stop—there may be an enemy lurking on your way: load your pieces: fix your bayonets—balls! balls.' They obeyed: they attempted again to lift the body, and bear it off, with the melancholy determination of doing to it the speediest and most honourable rites of sepulture. It swung, and heaved so lifelessly, as they raised it, that Harold, Harold! the fierce young soldier, the unsparing and bloody, was overcome anew. `Oh, my God! my God!' he repeated, over and over again; `his wife, his wife, his poor dear wife! Oh, what will become of her!'—and then, reeling to the wall, and burying his face in the curtains, he added, convulsively, as he raised his locked hands to heaven. `Oh, it will kill her! it will kill her! Father! Father! it will kill her.' `Wretches!' he added, rushing forward and striking one to the earth, with ungovernable fury, as they all at once abandoned their burden, suffering it to roll from their palsied arms; standing with outstretched hands, and staring eyes, as if petrified by something too horrible to name. They gasped for breath, heedless of their prostrate comrade, nor once taking off their eyes from the body, which began to move—could it be! Harold stood in a transport of bewildering and distracting hope, and terror. The chest heaved. A deep sigh was drawn. `Enough! Enough!' cried Harold—`he lives! O God, I thank thee!' The governor had only swooned, but it was nearly the swoon of death to him. Thrice had he partially recovered, and relapsed, in the darkness, and noise, and terror that had beset him, and would, in all human probability, never have opened his aged eyes again, if the movement of his chest had not been accidentally observed, by the frightened soldiers, as they uplifted him, to bear him away to the garrison. VOL. I. D Harold was still upon his knees. `Fly! fly!—some wine, some wine,' he said. `Merciful father I do thank thee!—Begone!—quick, quick!' The party that was sent away soon returned, and the joy of Harold, as the old man opened his eyes upon his bosom, while they chafed his temples and poured cordials down his throat, with the officious tenderness of children, was so transporting and beneficent, that the comrades of Frederick Brown began to look for a gleam of mercy, even from the fierce and implacable Harold. Nay, one of them had the hardihood to intercede for him, and to ask if he had not better be sent to the garrison for security; knowing that when once there, his escape would be certain, if not his pardon. `Yes, yes—poor Brown,' answered Harold—`to the garrison, with all my heart—away with him.' The soldiers were ready to kneel to him: that he, Harold, whom nothing could intimidate; he, who was clothed with the power of life and death in the army, from whose decree there was no appeal; he, who was so strict and terrible in his retribution; that he should relent so readily, was most unaccountable. Oh, they little knew the heart of that wayward and melancholy being: they little knew that the sternest nature is artificial: that the iron bound and immoveable are tenderest at their core. Little knew they of this truth, told in later days by a bard whose `veins ran lightning,'— that there is a lava in the heart of man—a spirit of flame and blood, which quickens in power as it diminishes in quantity—that The deepest ice that ever froze Can only o'er the surface close:— The living stream runs quick below, And flows—and ne'er can cease to flow. Byron. —that this is a spirit, thus distilled and rectified by God himself, from the purest element of man's nature —undiluted by weakness and tears, unsullied by earthiness; kept in the reservoir of a clear heart, which though its surface be adamantine, when smitten by His power, will give out, with every throb and contraction, its gushing chrystal and pearl, while there is one drop of blood to feed the fountain and be converted into immortal aliment for the unpolluted and unprofaned. These are they, whose mercy is felt! These are they, whose friendship may be depended upon. These are they, whose love is perpetual and unchanging! and these, the stern and unforgiving of heart, are never, never! like those of a kinder nature, festering with impure thought. Their vengeance is justice. Their wrath is that of the Divinity. Their mercy like the dews of heaven: to be won only after the duties of the day are past, and the solemn loveliness of night and repose cometh out, filling all creation, animate and inanimate, the dispositions and the purposes of men, with a relenting tenderness. Bind ye their pulses up with adamant; sheathe them in tenfold steel, the living drop that is hidden within, will burst and scatter all its cells, all its cearments, all its panoply, at the touch of kindness, or love, or innocence! Find ye this power in hearts of a softer mould? this truth and divinity; in those who melt at the first breathing of solicitation or entreaty? Oh no, while the willing and merciful of mankind are agitated and tremulous with every sigh that passes over them, and every tear that drops upon them, the hearts of these—like the deep Ocean, cloudy and unfathomable, to all but the courageous and exploring, sheltering the treasuries of many an empire, the gold and spoil of many a kingdom, covering the mysteries and the glories that encumber the foundations of our world—the deep Ocean! which cannot be agitated without upheaving to the light its pearls and diadems, and ivory and coral—These, the hearts of these, reveal no riches but in their commotion. They are like the great sea in tranquillity and calm, which shows nought of the glittering dust that made its waters turbid, and defined its boundaries with undulating ridgy lustre, like drifted gold; nought of the beautiful and nameless, countless, productions of its depth, subsiding and descending again through the transparent waters, after the tumult hath passed, to their dim places of hallowed and mysterious concealment, and staining the water with traces of coloured fire, in their descent —like broken and shattered stars sinking and quivering in a deep blue element. Such were the disposition and heart of Harold— their riches were only to be seen in convulsion. Here —the man, whom in his mind, he had doomed to death, was already forgiven, in gratitude to heaven, for its merciful interposition. Harold had the constitution of a hero; young as he was, it could be seen. He was great only on great occasions. Touch his heart, and it quaked aloud; but then, it was not easily touched. After a time, the good old man became partially restored; sufficiently so, indeed, to signify, by the motion of his hand, that he could not speak. Harold had already sent a messenger to the government-house to apprise its mistress of the situation, and to account for the absence of her husband. At last a litter was prepared, and accompanied by a file of soldiers with fixed bayonets, conducted by Harold himself, with a drawn sword, amid the blaze of many torches; the veteran was borne towards his home, to be committed to the care of his young and lovely wife. If aught could soothe him in this world, Harold was sure that it would be her affectionate, innocent attentions. Several times on the way, the governour partially arose, and looked about upon the armed men around him, with a troubled and dissatisfied air; and once, it was evident from the horror that set itself for a moment in every feature, as his eye wandered over the litter and guards, that he took it for some funeral procession—perhaps his own!—as he lay extended upon the crimson velvet litter, made of lances, interwoven, and covered with tattered ensigns. His recollections were exceedingly discomposed, but enough could be gleaned from his incoherent ejaculations, on the way, to show that he was fearfully beset by some Indian phantom; once, and once only, as they approached his house, he seemed to recover his faculties for a moment, for he seized Harold's arm, looked earnestly in his face, and demanded in a low whisper, if he had seen it? Harold shook his head. `No! well, I pray God that you never may, my dear boy—may—he—he—' continued he, his voice growing fainter and fainter at every word. They arrived at the door. The house had been barricadoed a few hours before, and was now completely equipped and manned for a siege, under the direction of its high spirited mistress. She came to the door. She was very youthful—and there was—I know not what—a something that it is impossible to describe— something of deep and tender melancholy, and loftiness and pride, and loveliness, that, altogether, caused him who first saw her, to hold his breath while she spoke, and moved. `So young,' a stranger would say, `so young, and yet so haughty! so very young, and beautiful, with the immortal beauty of intellect, and yet, the wife of a decrepid old man! It is very strange.' She approached with a firm step,—and gave immediate directions to the party, betraying no childish emotion, reserving all expressions of grief or tenderness for solitude, and then returning, with an undismayed look, to the completion of her defences. This done—the door closed—and the governor gently laid upon a sofa in the hall, and the servants and soldiers withdrawn, the door opened, and the lady Elvira (such was her name) entered in silence and loneliness, to her duty, like a ministering angel. There was no idle display of suffering, no ostentation of woe or kindness; but her delicate hand was upon his forehead, and that was enough! `Wounded,' said she, to the old family surgeon who was supporting his head. `No, my lady, I believe not,' answered he—raising his eyes and dwelling with the rapturous delight of a parent upon the beautiful proportions of her neck, and the swell of her bosom, through the thin muslin that covered it, both rendered visible just then by the action of her arm, as she extended it, and let fall the gathered drapery that had, till then protected her—She saw the look; but she neither blushed nor trembled—he had D 2 been her family physician, and she loved him like a daughter—Ha!—why that flush!—that trepidation!— that frown!—and the terrible beauty of those clear blue eyes, streaming their intermittent flashes of wrath? The secret is not to be told. A darker eye is upon her; an eye rivetted and blazing with intemperate ardour—Harold is there, unseen till this moment—he is now advancing with his proud, impatient look subdued, and countenance pale, very pale, with the profound humility of his heart. He comes, half conscious of his offence—will she forgive him. Her brow contracts. Her countenance assumes an expression—a strange, bewildering expression—It is not to be translated. It cannot be. Her trembling hands are vainly employed in adjusting her night dress, so as to conceal the tumult of her heart. But it cannot be— not only is the beautiful, delirious undulation to be seen, but the burning crimson of her neck and bosom, that rose at the sight of Harold, and deepened at every step of his approach, hath tinged the very muslin with an airy and delicate blush. She cannot speak. Harold advances. She turns toward him in all her surpassing loveliness, rebuking him with her majestick silence, till his forehead almost touches the earth, in his awe and timidity, blinded and overpowered by her presence. This done—with the flash of sudden determination so common with him, as he grows older, he raises his fine forehead to the sky, with a look, as haughty as her own, a look, that hath retrieved him, in the moment of his extremest peril—bows with a stately movement, and slowly withdraws.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER IV. Oh, the heart that has truly loved, never forgets; But as truly loves on to the close; As the sunflower turns on her God, when he sets, The same look that she turned when he rose! — Moore. Il vaudrait mieux cent ois ne'/da/etre—que miserable. Rousseau. Why have I chosen this motto? In good faith, I can hardly tell. Perhaps it may be, however, because I heard a dear young creature, who always reminds me of a chief personage in this book, whenever I hear her sweet, thrilling, melancholy voice, once sing it, while her own heart was breaking. O, it was like the voice of the nightingale, bereaved of her young; or innocent lips gushing out with tenderness and melody. The dear, dear girl! I never shall forget her. Her constancy was like that of Elvira, and both of them loved like the flower of the sun, worshipping on, at his rising and setting, in cloud and in shadow, in glory and in light, with the same expression of drooping and confiding loveliness; the same beneficent and hallowed yielding! Still loving! still beloved! O, is there aught else worth coveting in heaven! No!—for God, himself, is Love and Constancy; and they who resemble him must love, and love forever! Is there aught else in religion? No, for religion `the pure and undefiled religion,' of the pure in heart, the high and holy, is Love, and Love only; not the base, sensual passion; but the immortal, unwithering impulse and sustenance of great hearts and proud natures; natures, unalloyed with infirmity, and proud, because of their origin and destiny. In the morning, just as the dappled east began to redden with the new daylight, after a night of feverish and wild dreaming, the good old governour awoke, exceedingly refreshed; and lay, with his eyes shut, revolving the mysterious adventure of the preceding night, in his mind. It was all in vain. He could remember nothing distinctly. That an apparition had been before him; that, somehow or other, he had been engaged in mortal strife, he had a kind of dim and wavering, shadowy and uncertain recollection, but all else, with whom, and where, had been held the battle— all!—was gone, in the terrour of the interview, and the long insensibility and agitation that succeeded, What he had dreamed appeared reality; and the real, as he strove in vain to recall the particular features, took the fantastick and shifting proportions of a dream. The effort grew painful to him. He became weary with the intensity of his own reminiscence, and was fast relapsing again into a disturbed and broken slumber, half conscious that it was better for him to sleep, and half yielding to the delicious influence of such consciousness, and yet occasionally starting and grasping with a sudden and convulsive hand, whatever happened to be nearest him, like one that overcome by drowziness upon a precipice, partially yields to it, grappling at the weeds and grass, and starts and shrieks, as he feels his hold relaxing, and dreams that he is falling. While he was in this state of protracted and uncertain delirium, some of the older and nearer members of the council, who had heard an aggravated and terrible account of the night's alarm, and the situation of the governour, from the fugitives, made their appearance in the apartment. They were cautiously announced, but in their awkward earnestness to save trouble, were literally treading upon the heels of the servant. It was no morning for business, they soon found, and one as little proper for compliments and ceremony; and after a few faint struggles between their curiosity, and their habitual veneration for their good old governor, they took leave to withdraw, and were immediately succeeded by the governour's beautiful wife. It was the fashion of the times to wear a lofty and unmeaning sort of head dress, whose only recommendation was its costliness. There were few ladies of the time who could obtain one of these ridiculous and unnatural incumbrances, that did not wear it constantly: and the lady Elvira was probably the only woman above the rank of an ordinary labourer's wife, in the colony, who had the heart to wear her own glossy and beautiful brown hair, in all its prodigal and redundant richness, with no other ornament than a plain blue ribbon, fancifully interwoven here and there over the head, and binding her forehead aslant with the artful simplicity of a flower girl that enwreaths her white forehead with garlands of deep blue water lilies. Her dress—what shall I say of it? Will the truth be acceptable? It ought to be; and therefore, at the risk of being laughed at, to the end of this chapter, at least, I must delare that, I have never been satisfied with any woman's dress since—what there was, I know not, about the lady Elvira, but her clothes always seemed to fit her better than those of any other ladies fitted them, and were always worn with an air of delicate, unstudied, unobtrusive propriety and grace, that I never could see in another. The flowing folds of her dress I remember, were usually tucked up, when she was about her house, an held by her girdle, with the free and innocent air of one who loves fashion and follows it with the feeling of youth, but has the good sense to prefer comfort and propriety, when they and fashion cannot be reconciled together. In such a dress, she now entered the sick chamber of her husband, her loose sleeves looped up for the occasion, and exposing her exquisitely moulded arms of unsullied whiteness; arms, that from the unfrequency of their exposure, would totally eclipse the most beautiful and delicate of those that are habitually revealed to the sun and wind, or, what is worse, to the tainting and impure gaze of the profligate and licentious. She entered on tip-toe, and bore, in a richly chased goblet of antique workmanship, some cordial, such as wives only can prepare, and the weary in spirit alone appreciate. She came to the bed side, and stooping affectionately over her husband, gently insinuated one arm under his neck, placed an additional pillow under his head, and began inviting him with her full blue eyes to partake; who could resist such endearment? A wife leaning upon your bosom, her arm supporting you, her eyes swimming with dew, and her beautiful mouth trembling with anxiety—who could resist her? “A brow all of wisdom, and lip all of love!” No human being! The hardiest and the sternest; the wickedest and the worst; the veriest ruffian that ever walked the earth, must yield up his soul to such caressing, and cry out, as did old Lear to Cordelia when he awoke—from his long kingly trance, broken in heart and bowed in spirit, and beheld her sweet eyes weeping and dissolving above him, her soft form undulating before his face—when he awoke thus—in the arms of his child—his daughter; with his old cheek resting upon her hallowed and pure bosom!—and said to her, with uplifted hands— `Be your tears wet?— If you have poison for me—I will drink it.' Who could resist it? What spirit, even of a dying man, would not linger a little while? Whose recollection would not return, and glimmer, for a moment, about the earliest and tenderest of his emotions, lighting up with a pale and melancholy lustre the mysterious and beautiful of the past—at so beseeching a look? His eyes dwelt tenderly upon her; he sighed, his lips moved, and the light of returning intelligence, for a moment, illuminated his venerable countenance, as he eagerly caught her soft hand to his heart, and pressed her tremblingly and doubtfully in his arms. `Elvira!—love! —is it you?' The words were only those of habitual kindness, as of a father to his daughter, and Elvira saw that he was not entirely master of himself, even yet. At the next breath his manner changed—his countenance fell—and the next, with a terrifying earnestness, he laid his hands upon her forehead—parted her damp hair—and fell to a sad and solemn persual of her lineaments: rapid transitions of thought were then visible, passing, like vapours, over his broad, full forehead, and she feared that a settled delirium might have possession of him. `Yes! yes, love—I saw him; yes, yes, I saw him'— he said hurriedly, and in a low difficult voice, and then looking around cautiously, added in a whisper that chilled her blood, even in the light and air of a summer morning,—`alone, alone! all, all, alone!' The bed shook under him—`not dead!—no, no, not dead! not dead!'—he continued, closing his eyes, and muttering to himself. At length he began to recover. Towards the evening of the third day he was able to sit up and maintain a part in a patient and low conversation. Certain of his tried friends, the associates of half a century, were about him; and after listening to a particular account of all that had happened at, and since, the night of the alarm, he proceeded to give his orders for the reception of the Indians, if they should see fit to renew their attack, before he was able to superintend the defence in person. He inquired with deep anxiety into the whole of the adventure; the hour; the situation in which he, himself, was found; the conduct of the sentinel, the garrison, and particularly, into all that had been done and said by Harold. `When did he return?' said the governour, thoughtfully. `That very night; in the midst of the uproar,' some one answered. `As if he had dropped from the skies!' said another, his eyes shining with enthusiasm. `Indeed.'— (a long pause.)—`Well, well, I am glad of it;' and then, as if aware that his manner might lead their thought astray, the governour added, `I am now so accustomed to the society of Harold, that I feel in a measure alone, dissatisfied, and unhappy, whenever he is away.' `And I, Sir, am not astonished that it is so,' said a white headed, little, bright eyed old man, who had long been the tried and trusty counsellor of our governor, `I am not indeed—for I have long observed that the bravest of us, however unwilling he may be to confess it, (glancing his eye at a younger man, who turned away his face at the moment) feel and act with a sense of security in his presence, that seems to desert them when he is gone.' This was said seriously and deliberately; and the governour catching his hands, gave them a hearty shake, as he replied with a tone and look of peculiar emphasis, `Arnold! I know thee! That stripling deserves all that thou canst say or think of him.' `He is a rash obstinate boy,' said a third, a very tall harsh looking military man. `You are right, my excellent friend, he is rash and obstinate,' said the governour in reply, `I admit it—but it is the rashness and obstinacy of a hero.' `Of Charles of Sweden,' said his antagonist. `I am no lover of such heroes.' The governor smiled. `Major, my good friend,' said Arnold, in his conciliating tone, all mildness, and firmness, `Remember his age. He is yet a boy, and could I marshal his spirit aright, I should have no fear that he would be a great and good man.' `A good man! never!' was the reply, and the speaker arose from his seat with the angry expression of deep and unconquerable, energetick and immoveable conviction; like a zealot that pronounces his belief, under the sanction of martyrdom, doubting not, hesitating not; unqualifying his declaration by aught of infirmity, either in tone, look, or action—`never, never.' `Yes, my friend, I repeat it, a good man,' said Arnold; `he has the elements of all goodness. That he is headstrong I do not deny; but then he is as obstinate in right as in wrong. `And do you not, Morgan,' laying his hand upon the major's heart, `do you not, I ask you as a soldier and a man, I put it home to you as one that I reverence, do you not love Harold the better for what you call his rashness and obstinacy? Honestly now, dear Morgan, honestly now.' `Why, to tell the truth, Arnold,' said Morgan, kindly pressing his hand, and shaking his head doubtfully, `I hardly know what to say. I do not deny that there is something generous and noble in these very qualities; and you know that I love Harold too, but I do not like to see him spoilt. In one word, governour, I may as well speak my mind at once. I shall never have a better opportunity, I dare say. Too many affairs; too much business, and too many men are entrusted to him He is but a boy—' `Sir,' said the governor, and Morgan stopped short; `Sir, that boy has been tried; again and again has he been tried. He has been weighed in the balance, and he was never found wanting. Let us change the subject.' `But his temper,' said Arnold, who always moved like a peace maker, with his quiet and steady countenance among the turbulent and hasty, `his temper is terrible. That you will not deny governour.' The governour's countenance had changed. There was a dead, painful silence; offended dignity on the one part, and offended companionship on the other, for several moments. But after a brief struggle, the natural feeling of the old man's heart returned, and he extended a hand to each, and continued shaking them with the greatest energy, all the while, as he added. `Yes, my friends, yes, that temper is terrible. Harold is a godlike boy, but I do tremble for his vindictive, unsparing, and deadly temper.' `And so do I, and I too,' answered both the veterans, returning the shake; while Arnold, wiping away a tear with the back of his hand, added, `but who can tell? His destiny may be, to have this evil spirit rebuked. And surely there is comfort in our experience— for what has he ever undertaken, in which he did not succeed? What, in which, if he failed, it was not because he scorned to succeed?' `Thank you, my good friend, thank you,' said the governour. `That is Harold's character! He never stops half way, in aught that is worth his ambition! And never, never, I appeal to the experience of his whole life, never did he fail to overcome an evil passion, or an evil habit, when once convinced that it was worth his while. His resolution is immortal. I never saw any man, young or old, so fixed, so immoveable. Nay, I never saw any living creature so fitted and exercised in heroick self denial.' `It only remains, therefore,' said Arnold, thoughtfully, `that we go about convincing Harold that this passion is a weakness.' VOL. I. E `Yes, yes, that is enough. Do that; get Harold's promise to overcome it, and my salvation on the issue, that, before a twelvemonth is passed, he shall be distinguished for his equanimity. Nay, I can forgive you both for smiling, but I could tell you stranger things than that, of his resolution, and success, in subduing; nay, in eradicating, root and branch, the most settled habits of his disposition. Get his promise, and I will answer for the rest.' `He is fearless in the extreme,' said Morgan. `Ready, prompt, and bold,' said the governour, like one never weary of the theme, and delighted at hearing the name of a favourite. `But then,' added Arnold, with the continual desire of tempering all that the others said, and thus leading both to assimilation—`but then, what a raging lion, when he has once snuffed blood.' `Verily he is wolfish, actually wolfish, at times,' said Morgan; `he delights in carnage; mere deeds of peril are no longer sufficiently exciting to him. He must wash his hands in the hot bubbling foam of his enemy's heart; or he comes home, troubled in spirit, and panting for new slaughter. Indeed, indeed, I do feel afraid of him at times. His wrath is so unlike the fierce quick passion of his age; his appetite for danger, so insatiate, so unnatural.' `Never mind, my old friend,' said Arnold, `a few years more will tame him.' `A few years more!' said the oldest man in the room —he was blind and bald, and his head was shaking with the palsy, while his countenance wore the consummate expression of wisdom and serenity, profound observation and undiminished faculty, suddenly wrought upon by a divinity stirring within. His voice was low and sweet, giving out a feeble and plaintive sound like the strings of a harp touched by dampness; but hollow, and authoritative, like that of one familiar with heavenly and mysterious things, and commissioned to bear testimony even from the grave—all eyes were upon him. His voice had not been heard before. It was most unusual for him to speak at all, but when he did speak, the wildest altercation instantly died away in silence. `A few years more!' he repeated, `he cannot live, even a few years more. In no situation, can he live. Death is already at work in his heart. A few years more, and Oh, his proud spirit will be down, his hot blood chilled.' A dead silence followed. Was it a malediction or a prayer, that they had heard? Be it what it might, it fell, with a dead weight upon their ear, like a midnight prophecy. `O, I hope not; I hope not,' said Arnold, recovering from the awful impression of the old man's words. `Arnold, Arnold, thou canst not hope this more earnestly than I do. Thou canst not,' he repeated, his voice trembling, and the tears filling his eyes. `Inaction would destroy him. The angry activity of his spirit has already wasted him to a skeleton. And action, action, that destroys him too. I never knew a boy of such promise wear to maturity; no, never. Nay, my friends, now that I am myself again, I cannot reconcile it to my conscience even to pray that he may live. So terrible as he has been—as he is—as he will be, increasing in power, his rage and thirst and hunger, not merely for adventure, for that were worthy of his reason, and he is weary of adventure—but for slaughter and devastation, battle and flame—all the— The speaker was interrupted by the entrance of Lady Elvira, followed by an officer. His appearance was martial and precise; but he approached the governour, apparently regardless of all the forms, even of military courtesy—and stood, without touching his sword or hat, directly before him:—rooted, upright, and breathing hard. `How dare you, Sir!' said the governour, rising with all the majesty of his age and office and character, and was proceeding, when the stranger put into his hands a letter, which the governour hastily tore open with an agitated hand, and read over, without observing that the eye of the stranger was scowling upon him. `Bring him hither, this instant!' said the governour, and the stranger departed. `My friends,' continued the governour, `you will excuse me. I have some weighty affairs on hand.' They departed, successively shaking his hand in the good old fashion of the day, and left him alone, once more, with his wife. `Now!' said the governour, `He will soon be here. I shall soon see him again, love.' `Whom?' said the lady Elvira. `Harold, my dear.' `Harold!' she exclaimed, half relinquishing the hold that she had of her husband—`Harold!' `Ah!—what means this? lady Elvira!—so pale—art thou ill, love?—and now again—so red! why, how thy hand trembles: Art ill love?' `Oh, no, no—a slight agitation. It will be soon over. It is already; it is past, now; nay, I am entirely well now.' She continued, faintly, very faintly—`entirely well, now.' The governour looked upon her for a moment, with visible concern, and then, with an air of affectionate gaiety, bade her, coaxingly, not to regard such things. `You must forget and forgive love,' said he: `Remember his age, a mere boy, you know—he meant no harm—It was only one of his impassioned bursts of natural feeling— Do forgive him—' `Indeed, my husbaud, it pains me to refuse you, but my heart would contradict me were I to say that I forgive him. No—no! I cannot forget, nor forgive it. No, at the risk of offending your partiality for him, I must say that I do not like him; that I think him a most dangerous young man.' The governour smiled, threw his arm round her neck, and drew her closely to him, as she continued— `Nor can I see what you and others find in him to admire so extravagantly, for really it does appear extravagant to me. His courage is cruelty and ferocity. Is it not? Has he ever shown, on any occasion, that calm, heroick self possession, that courage of the truly great, which buckles on its harness in silence, and faces death with an awful and unchanging serenity? Has he ever?' `What, Elvira! have you forgotten this?—this!' replied the governour, tearing open his bosom, and showing the seam of a frightful bayonet or sabre wound: `this! love, or the occasion?' `Oh, no,' said Elvira, her fine eyes filling with tears, and her voice trembling in her heart, `oh, no, and never shall forget it. My husband, forgive me! I have wronged Harold. I feel that I have. I am sorry for it. But that event, determined and gallant as it was, is one cause of my injustice to him. It excited such hope in my mind, that I doubly feel the disappointment which his present unhallowed and bloody indulgences have caused. Is he not, my husband, is he not the most untractable of human beings? Has it not been so with him, from his very childhood? so, at least have I been told. So fierce, so Indian-like in his temper, and then, unlike the indian, he is so profane, that the commonest soldier, I have heard, will shake at the uttering of his blasphemy. Indeed, my beloved, I cannot bear to see him, such is my terrour in his presence, such the undefinable agitation that seizes me, whenever I hear or see him—my very blood curdles at his voice, and I cannot bear to see him approach any body that is dear to me. Mine may be a prejudice; nay, I am willing to grant that it is; (her voice grew deeper; with a sweeter solemnity of manner, like that of some young priestess newly initiated, some Cassandra denouncing the evil spirit while afar off.) `But then, it is so strong, so settled, so interwoven and intermingled with all the fibres and blood of my being, so like a mortal antipathy, that I am ready to believe, at times, that it is implanted by nature to speak for my own preservation. Do we not find it so? nay, my husband, I am very serious—what keeps us from the loathsome and pestilential? what from the terrible and blood-thirsty? Is there not an instinct in our nature superiour to wisdom, outrunning all experience, which infallibly directs us to the animals, the dispositions, nay, to the very fruits and flowers of the desert, if they be innocent. An instinct that fills the heart with dread and abhorrence at the first sight of others; irritating all the senses, and quickening them to E 2 intensity for our preservation! If this be so, and who will deny it? surely we ought never to distrust the deep inward admonition, the involuntary sinking of the heart, its faint, sickly shuddering, when a human creature hath crossed our path, and given rise to them. No, my husband, no! I must believe, I do believe that the Almighty, our kind and indulgent Father, he who hath made nothing in vain—I must believe, and I do, that these emotions are given to us for our security; that they are not to be distrusted, or derided. You smile—but my feelings are those of religion, of settled conviction: and not to be changed by a smile. I speak with emphasis, because I feel every word that I utter. What attracts the youngest infant to this person? and what so unaccountably repels him from that? nay, the very brute, the dog that lies at your feet? for he has his likes, and his dislikes, his aversions and antipathies. O! it cannot be that these natural and incessant yearnings and shiverings of the spirit are given us in vain! Oh, no, it cannot be. No! they are substitutes for experience. They teach to the young and innocent at a glance, as by intuition, precisely what is confirmed to the wise and observing, that unholy and perilous things have their own peculiar shape and hue; that passion and wickedness have a transforming power upon the loftiest and lovliest of human countenances; and that God hath written upon the face of every son and daughter of Adam, in a character that the simplest and weakest may understand, at a glance, the history and life and habit of each. Therefore, do I fear the very playfulness of Harold. His lineaments, even when unconvulsed, unilluminated by a rebellious spirit, in arms against all that is holy and peaceable, even in repose, are inwrought and articulate with bad thought, the thought of a perturbed, ascendant, and unappeasable ambition. Yes, my husband, I do fear his very playfulness, as I would that of a pet tiger.' `Elvira! Elvira!' said the governour, earnestly grasping her hands and looking in her face—`what an enthusiast! verily love, thou art as implacable as that very spirit of evil, which thou hast conjured up! wouldst thou rebuke, even the `pet tiger,' if it fulfilled only the appointed office of its nature!' His tone suddenly changed to the deepest solemnity, and he continued.—`Where had I been, Elvira, but for that boy? Indian-like in his disposition! True, he is Indian-like, and I glory in him that he is so. At this very moment, Elvira, that boy is the best general in North America; the best soldier. Twice hath he saved my life; once, as we both know, in the extremest peril—when I was beset on all sides, entangled in the trappings of my horse, drowning, and faint with loss of blood—and once, as thou knowest too, when all the world beside had deserted me.—Oh, no, love—I understand that pressure, I do not mean to reproach thee. Thou didst not know my danger—but all the world beside thee, had abandoned me.'—(Elvira bowed upon his hands.) `Ah, I am thankful, indeed,' said she, submissively. `Heaven sent him, surely, and we were most unworthy, not to be grateful.' `No, no, my own dear girl,' said the governour, in reply, pressing his lips to her delicate forehead, through all the veins of which, the blood flashed like lightning, at the touch—`No, no, you must not think so of Harold. It pains me. It is unjust. I cannot bear that the proud boy should be so regarded by one, so deeply his debtor. I cannot indeed. I love him as my own child. I would have thee love him too—what! tears—oh, do not weep. I would not be unkind, but, poor Harold— it would go hard with his desolate heart if we forget him.' (A long pause.) `He may want your friendship, Elvira, one day, when he shall have no other friend upon this earth'—(his voice faultered, and Elvira had hidden her face in his bosom—trembling—trembling, even to the extremity of her locked hands)—`And I would have you do him justice now, that you may be his friend then. No, no, you must overcome this prejudice. It is unworthy of you. Believe me, I know him better than you. He is altogether better than he appears. The natural expression of his countenance is mild and thoughtful. Observe it when undisturbed, when he is not listening. His worst fault is, that he seems anxious to appear worse than he is. It is strange, but it is so. I have known many examples of such extravagance. All men strive to appear what they are not. The kind will affect severity; the meek and lowly, and timid, will often walk haughtily, and bluster to conceal their nature. No, no, Elvira, this is not a mortal antipathy implanted in your heart for wise purposes. It is a weakness, and to me, who know nothing parallel to it in your character, and I have studied it from your very infancy, to me, it is unaccountable. Have charity for him. Remember, he is an orphan; hardly used by the world—born and nurtured in a season of wrath and trial—baptized in blood—can you wonder at his dreadful appetite?'—(Lady Elvira shuddered, and averted her head, with her hand pressed strongly upon her heart). `He is of the patricians here, you know,' continued the old man with a smile, `from the princes of the land, and his whole blood, even on the father's side, is almost kingly—He is at least, as noble as ourselves.' Lady Elvira raised her head—the fire started from her eyes: and her brows took upon themselves, as she moved her stately neck, all the bearing and presence of something regal. `As ourselves!' continued he, gently disengaging her arm, and drawing her kindly towards him. `Yes, Elvira, I am willing to say it again, the blood of Harold is nobler than our own.' `Can it be possible!' answered the lady, with a look of astonishment, and intense curiosity. `Yes, my dear, it is possible. I have good reasons for what I say. At some future day, when I shall be permitted, I will make you acquainted with all that concerns him. The papers are already in my possession; the proofs—and to provide against all possible acaccident, for, at my age, dear Elvira, the uncertainty of life becomes every hour more distinctly acknowledged—we stand amid the wreck of many generations, an especial mark for accideut and peril—our companions pining away, ourselves surviving, as by a perpetual miracle, daily repeated, drawing the highest prizes, day after day, from the lottery of life and death—living only by incessant, and almost unnatural reprieve:—properly impressed with these reflections, I have already prepared the narrative, and put it, where it will be found, when the papers that these hands have tied up, shall be untied by the hands of another. I mention the nobility of his descent, love, because I know that there is a prejudice in thy heart, as in mine, for all its foolish prerogatives. Indeed, I am willing to confess that, some of my earlier likes and dislikes were not a little regulated, by the pitiful gradations of birth and blood. But, here, at least, where the oldest of our ancestors, are but of yesterday, compared with the men of the wilderness; them, who hold their charter of nobility from the living God, dated on the morning of creation, and blazoned with the sunshine of the first day—here, ought we to be humble in our pretensions, lest some of these old nobles of the wood should compel us to do homage, and swear fealty anew, for the lands that we hold of them'—He was interrupted by a tread at the door.—It was Harold. His look was melancholy. As he entered the room, however, he gradually assumed a haughtier aspect, as of one preparing for the encounter of prejudice and unkindness, and walked forward with the aspect and bearing of him, who feels every muscle and tendon of his frame, contributing to every motion of his body, and every thought of his heart. Lady Elvira instantly left the room; His eye followed her, and a slight paleness—was it anger, or sorrow? passed over his countenance. The port of Harold was always lofty—and on this occasion, coming to outface, what he scorned to soothe or conciliate, a mortal prejudice, it had become peculiarly so; but yet, there was an involuntary bowing and yielding of his whole person, as his eyes followed her retreating and stately form; and it was not till the governour had spoken twice, that he had sufficiently recovered from the prostrating effect of her last look, as she lifted her blue eyes in passing away with a terrified and timid expression, like that of one who is unwilling to betray all her dislike, and pitying, from her heart, the unfortunate object of it—to answer him intelligibly. But then—then! there was a transformation quicker than any that was ever wrought by magick. His melancholy vanished like an apparition. His paleness fled. A deep hectick coloured all his sallow cheek. His eyes lighted; and his form heaved and swayed, as with the sudden inroad of tumultuous and boundless thought. The governour observed it, and extended his hand. Why dwells the old man with such a subdued and compassionate look upon the visage of Harold? and why trembles the lip of Harold?—so strongly compressed— why turns he away?—why that shiver?—is he speechless? He recovers. The awful meaning of the Indian— the fire of his spirit—lighting itself, by its own power, amid encompassing desolation and darkness—hath been dimmed, and dampened, if not utterly quenched, since the good old governour pronounced, with a faltering voice, his last farewell benediction upon his youthful head. `Well, well!' said the governour at last—after repeated attempts, all of which had failed—`Poor Harold!— what have you done? How succeeded.' `Nothing, Sir! nothing!' was the reply. `Nothing could be done. I have traversed the whole continent. I have been to the western ocean. Tribe after tribe have I visited; nation after nation, whose existence is unknown even to the white traders—O, curse them, curse them all!' `Do not curse them, Harold. Did you find him?' `Find him! Can you ask me that question! Would you have seen me again, think you, if I had not found him? Do you know me, governour? Find him! Aye—aye! I did find him. I found him where I wished. His children were about him! His wife! his little ones!—his friends! many friends—and they were all armed, from head to foot—and I, governour, I—I was—as I am now—unarmed—except with this!' Saying this, he half plucked from his belt, a blade discoloured and rusty— `And this—this very knife! I drove up to the hilt into his heart!—look here! this is his blood—and this— this is the blood of his oldest son.' `His son?' `Yes, governour—but his oldest:—his youngest is unharmed—It was his own fault. He withstood me; nay worse, the fool dared to lay his hand upon me, as I passed away. I bade him desist. He disobeyed, and I struck him to my feet. How I escaped, God only knows!—I am scarred and wounded from head to foot —see here!' (he lifted his black hair, and showed where a ball had shorn it, and razed his temple)—`and here!' —he tore open his bosom, and showed a gash that had penetrated his side—`nor is this all,' said he, `they literally shot my panther skin from my shoulders—shot it to tatters, as I ran. But, it is over. I am avenged. I have kept my promise. No woman, no babe, no old man have I slain, but the murderer, the midnight murderer! By God, I can hear the blood rattling from his heart at this moment! And now! now, I have done with thee forever! The avenger of blood is weary! satiated! Thou weapon of wrath! away away! with thee forever!' he exclaimed, brandishing the long knife with both hands, and gazing upon the blade. `I have done with thee!— not one is left! not one! and never again shall this hand plight itself with thy reeking hilt. The children I forgive. The mother, and the babe, and the old men, I forgive. May God forgive them! Henceforth, I strike no man in vengeance. Let me live in peace. Let me die in peace, if so it may be. But if not—if not! why then, war! war! to all the ends of the earth! I shrink not. I tremble not. I have no longer any business with revenge. But wo to him, that shall waken me in defence! My spirit is appeased, and weary. Let me slumber. Have I not done as I swore? Is not my bond cancelled? Where then is my father? Let me see him. But no, no —I will wait mine appointed time. I care not to see him, with the feelings of a son; but I would look upon the terrible being as he appeared to me last—once more would I hear the voice which bade me kneel down, and bow myself to the work of death, in the darkness of the night, and the silence of an appaling solitude. Him! that would not let me see his face. Him! that stood by his only child, till he made a murderer of him! Him! that knelt down by the side of his only son, and bound him to hell by an oath!—O, I would travel the wide world over to see him, to curse him, as he hath cursed me, and to give up the ghost at his feet!' The governour gazed upon him in astonishment. `Is this the boy,' Harold, thought he, `this the stripling!' Rather is it not some exterminating angel, dealing out the judgment of heaven, amid fire and smoke, and pestilence and death! invulnerable! immortal! irresistible! How his manner hath changed! His whole deportment!—how resolute and confirmed!—how full of manhood!' True, he was changed, changed in heart and soul. His journeying had been in danger and in solitude—in darkness and in light—over precipice and torrent— herding with the serpent and the wolf, battling with monsters in the silence of death, beneath a sky of interwoven branches—shining with broad flowers, and party coloured leaves—beset on all sides with the transparent garniture of the wilderness, the red sun shining through it; the melody of innumerable waters around; the sparkling of ten thousand insects of gold and emerald, winged with thin blue flame, girdled and spotted, and stained with coloured light. A man of blood! sleeping calmly in the hallowed solitude! A Cain, sojourning in the garden, while on his errand of death, as if insensible to the reproach of all the breathing and eloquent tranquillity about him, and leaving it, unmindful of its awful admonition to forbear! Such had been the experience of Harold since they parted: and there is no discipline so effectual. Yea, he was changed, and the change had been wrought upon him in night and in darkness, in the presence of Jehovah and his angels. Let us dwell together upon his appearance. His form is muscular; but the strength of his limbs and chest, becomes visible only under vehement excitement. Then, he is all over nerve, like the young lion. The roundness of his limbs instantaneously assume the angular and broken outline of one heaving at a weight—toiling from head to foot, against a contracting pressure; dilating on all sides against a growing and crushing weight. From head to foot there is a visible working of sinews, knotted and writhing like vexed serpents, uncoiling, untwining, and detaching themselves for separate and deadly retaliation. His form is slender, of the middle height, and very graceful, not graceful however, with the delicate proportions of white sculpture, but graceful with the angry and high wrought expression of energy and power—the grace of those god like creatures that inhabit the southern America—the Creek Indians! the brown and living Apollos of the earth! There is yet an expression of melancholy in his countenance. Mark it. The heart of him that wears such an expression, so inward, so hopeless, so touching, be ye assured, hath not long to pant and swell, within this atmosphere. Many an eye will sadden in the contemplation of another, and yet few of us are ever aware that the young heart, pressed to our own perhaps, while our lids are filling with tears, is already touched and dissolving. Watch ye them with tenderness, who look as he looks. Your trouble will be short. He is wasting away with some slow, secret, and incurable malady,— under the occasional visitation too, of keen, fierce and unsparing agony. And yet there is nought to betray the deadly working of his ailment, except the pale, damp forehead, the uncomplaining eye, the trembling lip, and the deep, deep melancholy of his smile. What is it? that suffering? Whence is it? That mortal agony, whose traces even upon the front of youth, are as the traces of blood and sweat—intellectually wrung from the impalpable nature of the Indian. Whence is it? What is it? Who may tell? That he has suflered, is suffering, cruelly, terribly, and perpetually, may be seen; but who shall tell the sources thereof? Can it be that this is the secret of his guilt! May not this untiring impulse be that which drives him, in desperation, to the battle! May it not be that, but for the aching of his own heart, he would be kind, and affectionate, and humble? Look at him! Is it not enough to bring tears into the eyes of a stranger? There he stands! His fine neck and shoulders revealed—his panther skin wrapped with an air of martial negligence about his VOL. I. F broad chest—behold him! the embodied conception of early manhood, familiar with toil and thought—an ample brow, a free movement of every limb—and yet, with a countenance as if some fell and deadly poison, were thickening in the very fountain of his heart, turning his blood black—settling like lava, and weighing like lead, in all his limbs and arteries. The old governor idolises the boy. There is so much in his nature, of that heroick self abandonment; so much of chivalry, that immortal spirit which men love to dream of. We may condemn it, denounce it, in the hearing of our children, but let the deed be done, to which this spirit hath impelled one, let the thought be expressed, and lo! the eloquent crimson of the heart flashes upward, like lightning, to the cheeks, to the eye, through all the trembling and agitated extremities, in approbation of both! Such is man! This inconceivable property of youth, this incommunicable thought of passionate daring, sent home, like a fire brand, successively, through the linked hearts of a multitude, will kindle a whole people to rebellion. God! What is it! The electricity of the soul. One arm is waved, and lo! unnumbered arms accompany it. One voice is lifted up; and straightway the heavens are ringing with the cry of a whole nation! Empires move off in the desperate incantation of a young spirit, newly baptized in fire, dipped for immortality, when it first ascends to the place of sacrifice, with a face shining like his—who came down from the mountain, with the presence of Jehovah abiding upon his forehead, and stretching out his arms to the air! How like are his operations to those of that penetrating, quick illimitable fire of heaven, which agitates the elements to instantaneous combustion, thundering within the hollow caverns of the earth, and trumpeting aloud in the skies! What is it? whence is it, this godlike pre-eminence of man? This! that exploding beneath the very throne of empire, lays bare its mysterious foundations to the eye of the profane, covering the earth with the glittering fragments, of sceptres and chains, and crowns, and manacles, and leaving the royal banditti of the world, quaking and astounded, like men, over whose heads the blue sky has unexpectedly thundered, and reduced some of their party to ashes! This! the inextinguishable divinity within us!—the soaring of flame, kindled from everlasting to everlasting! It brightens; and the whole circumference of heaven is irradiated! It wanes, and the fair face of nature itself, nay, the countenance of the Almighty, as we behold it within the motionless, bright solitude of the seas passes away, away! like the shadow of another world! Know ye the name of this spirit?—its properties? Its name is Genius! Its properties? Oh, who may number them? None but the Perpetual. He only, who can span infinity—the interminable thought of Him only, can travel to the confines of its dominion. But where are we wandering? `But why,' continued the governour, after a long and breathless pause, like one who has been travelling in the high places of thought, the mountainous and precipitous, and stops, terrified at the magnificence below him—rolling cloud—and burnished metal—transparent waters shining, in the hues of sunset, and glittering hastily through the trees that outreach their innumerable branches beneath his feet—all admonishing him of peril, and winning him down from the drifted azure and gold of the sky, to the qualified and temperate lustres of the earth:—`But why this expression of sorrow, Harold? What has happened? Thy brow is cloudy. What has thwarted thee? Tell me.' `That devil, Logan,' said Harold, locking his arms, and stamping. `Logan!' echoed the governour, clapping his hands to his forehead, wildly—`Logan! What of him?—speak.' `He baffled me at every turn; withstand him who may? I cannot.' Continued Harold. `Logan!' repeated the governour—`Logan!' And he arose, bowing his tall and majestic frame, clasping his forehead still, and shutting his eyes as if to exclude some hateful spectre from the chambers of the soul. `But I have yet some hope, some,' continued Harold, `he loves—O, how fiercely! (his voice faltered)— he loves Loena—the only true Logan left. He is adopted into the family, and he hopes to — no, no!—accursed be the thought!' `He cannot, shall not prevail! Better, better, ten thousand times better, for him and her, that the panther had feasted on his limbs! rent him! torn him! tendon from tendon, and left his skeleton scattered about the entrance of her unapproachable solitude! Better that she had died ten thousand deaths—but'—(he wiped the sweat from his forehead, and gasped a moment for breath.) `But—but—I beg your pardon, governour, something has happened; you are right, I cannot, cannot tell what it is, cannot explain it—forgive me; I am mad, mad—raving mad at times—.... O, governour, know you that Logan is not a true born Indian?' `What mean you, Harold?' cried the old man, in astonishment, `not a true Indian!' `No,' added the boy, clasping his hands while his whole form dilated, `no, by the Great, the Blessed Spirit! he is not, I knew it! I knew it from the first! no Indian ever wrought so foully and bloodily! no Indian ever broke a fair treaty! no Indian ever put his hostage to death, no never! I knew it. He has not one drop of Indian blood in his veins..... He is a white man—all over—body and soul?' The governour shuddered at the rancorous scorn and detestation of lip and eye, in this creature of the woods, when he spoke of the white man. `But what then?' said he, in reply, `he is the more terrible.' `Oh no! governour, no!' answered Harold impatiently, `not more terrible—that were impossible. Treachery is never terrible—if my education among them that knew and practice it, hath taught me its true meaning. The white man is the more deadly, plausible, faithless, Christian like!' Harold paused, hung his head, and was silent, while his arms dropped lifelessly at his side, as if, having poured out at once, and for the first time, all the accumulated bitterness of his thought for many years, in that one word `Christian-like!' upon an object infinitely abhorred. `Logan! Logan!'—still muttered the governour, in deep and troubled abstraction. `Oh, Loena!' continued Harold, with a convulsive heaving of the chest, as if he were dislodging a heavy weight—`O, Loena! shall he prevail? no, no!—(he smote the table with his hand; the governour started from his reverie, and he continued)—`No, no! he shall not, and if he do not succeed,' he added, throwing his arms about the neck of the governour, his fine head all on fire with energy and menace—`if he do not succeed! —why then wo to their alliance! the confederacy is broken forever! He will fight them, curse them, make war upon them, all, all! brethren and sisters, young and old, women and children!—O, Loena—wilt thou? wilt thou?'—(his voice died away in the tones of rising suffocation.) `Logan!' muttered the governour again and again, relapsing into the same doubtful and dreaming tone. Harold released his arms. `Stay Harold, stay a moment,' said the governour, recovering and detaining his hand; `I have a strange suspicion—can it be? when did Logan leave his tribe? where was he seen last?' `Three weeks ago, he left them, and departed, nobody knew whither.' `Three weeks! no, no; it is impossible. And yet— yet—there was an amazing resemblance, now that I recall the whole; it is wonderful that it never occurred to me before—but my illness I suppose—it may be so.' `What, may be?' said Harold, anxiously; pray tell me? `The murderer of the sentinel—poor Robert—the midnight visitor.' `By heaven and earth!' cried Harold, leaping upon his feet, `it was he! it was he! Logan himself!—no other man could do it; no other man dare even to think of it; I would stake my life upon it, against all the red men of North America—yes, Logan was the murderer; they say too, that you were near being bayonetted, how was it? and that—that—you have been heard talking, strangely for you, in the language of terrour and F 2 supplication—again and again, in your sleep since—I hope not, my father.' `Give me thy hand, Harold, my son!' cried the governour, pulling him down upon his bosom—`yes, Harold, I will be thy father, and thou shalt be my son. God bless thee for the thought, Harold! God forever bless thee! my poor boy! There is none left now, none! to dispute my title.' Harold lifted his head; he was deathly pale; his brow darkened for a moment; he turned away his face, and a slight shivering ran over his limbs. `Harold, Harold! my dear boy!' rapidly articulated the old man, with shining eyes, like one just recovered from delirium—`Let me tell thee all about it; now, now, while I can tell it; I see it all now—every thing is distinctly before me, just as it was on that night'— (he shook, and gasped like a dying man, who fears that he shall not have time left to tell a tale of blood;—that he shall go mad ere he can exact the oath of vengeance.) He succeeded, however, and detailed, with surprising accuracy, all that had occurred; every thing, to the minutest particular, in the Council chamber, while the countenance of Harold grew rigid in his breathless attention. He finished. Harold threw up his arms to the sky. `By the blood of my fathers,' he cried, `but that was Logan himself:—Logan, the white Logan! Governour,' he added, in an eager low tone, close to the old man's ear, `what is his scalp worth to thee? wouldst thou not give thy right hand for it? Speak—say the word—and thou shalt have it.' The governour shuddered from head to foot—`Harold! I conjure thee!—hear me, hear me! Let nothing tempt thee—beware—O, promise me, promise me Harold, (he fell upon his knees,) promise me that thou wilt not pursue him.' Harold stood astonished, awe-struck, rebuked—but unabashed. `I promise!' said he, and the governour arose and blessed him. But the fervid brightness of his eye faded not—his cheek reddened a little, and a brief convulsion passed over his upper lip. The discipline, the religious discipline of the whites had taught him, that scalping was an atrocious crime, and though the boy did not well understand why it was less courteous and decent, than blowing a man limb from limb to the four corners of the earth, or hewing him down bone and sinew, into chips and shavings; yet, such is the force of education over reason, that the blood burnt his cheeks, and his ears tingled with the reproach of the governour's supplication. Such is the effect of education! Virtue and vice change places. Absurdity becomes orthodoxy, and wisdom, heresy, from the lessons of the nursery, sanctioned by the countenance of age and fashion. Communis error facit jus. The silence that followed was uninterrupted for many minutes, by aught, but the suppressed difficult breathing of Harold, who appeared occupied in some profound study. He sat with his hands strongly pressed upon his forehead, his eyes glittering, and motionless. Their heads almost touched, as they leaned towards each other; the sweat was upon their lips. The rebellious nature of the Indian rose in disdain, and trampled down all the formula and promises of that beautiful religion, of whose solemnity and tenderness, of whose merciful benignity and adaptedness to all the wants and infirmities of man, he knew only by the professions of them that came to him with fire and sword, and poison, and famine, and pestilence. At length, with a deep hollow sigh, he lifted his head. How changed! The thick black hair was matted and drenched upon his livid forehead—tears had fallen, but he knew it not—the sweat had rolled like a hot rain from his visage, but he was unconscious of it—so fearful had been the working of his heart, as it lay sweltering in the fervid indignation of his spirit, sending itself upward in vapour. `Did you miss nothing, father?' said he, as he uncovered his face, `nothing at all?' `Nothing.' `Have you searched since, particularly—with your own eyes?' `No.' `No!' echoed Harold, and instantly disappeared. The governour looked out, and discovered him bounding off in the direction to the Council chamber. He speedily returned. `I miss nothing,' said he, as he entered, in a tone of peculiar disappointment; `and indeed how should I? I know not what to miss—what to look for, I am not familiar with the places or appearances of things: but,' he added, with sudden vivacity—`it was Logan, nevertheless! I am sure of that— and I am equally sure that he came on some evil purpose; and most of all am I sure that, whatever were his purpose—that purpose was accomplished! He never failed, never!—in good or evil, never! No compunction, no pity, nor shame, nor remorse, nor danger ever turned him aside. Go, father, go—go yourself, but no, I forget; you cannot. Let, somebody go then, I do pray you, somebody that is acquainted with the place of every thing in the apartment.' He grasped the governour's hand in his, and continued, `O, I know Logan; and I know, what I cannot tell. The secret is not mine now; it is another's; when it is mine, hereafter, I will tell you. The time will come, it shall come; meanwhile, believe me, I know better than any other being upon this earth, what are the resources of Logan, and of what he is capable. The red men, my poor, simple, credulous countrymen, believe that he hath dealings with the Evil One, and verily, I am half persuaded to believe so too; at any rate, I'll swear to this—that he hath a devil. A messenger was sent, not because the governour had any serious apprehension for the property or furniture of the chamber, but merely to appease the impetuous boy, and yet, some how or other, earnestness, even when artificial, is so contagious, that the very basest will catch something of it, and feel a kind of bastard anxiety and enthusiasm, when master spirits are dealing with their passions before them; and the governor, who was not of the base, or even the poor in spirit, but had done many a gallant deed, and been stirred by many a glorious thought in his youth, now felt the martial spirit of gone by days quickening within him anew, like the dry bones that touched the prophet, whenever it came into contact with the fiery and inspiring material of Harold. Just so, did he, on this occasion, gradually work himself into a correspondent inquietude with that of Harold. Suddenly a thought seemed to strike him. `George, George,' he cried to his attendant—`run, run; look for the bag behind the curtain. By heaven, I have a strange fear—(the messenger departed)—and yet suppose it is gone—the treaty and all—what injury can arise to us? what benefit to Logan?' `It cannot be possible,' he contined, in a low soliloquy, as if endeavouring to reassure himself, and allay his own apprehensions, the more terrible for their very indistinctness, `nobody would steal that—nobody could know what was in it.' `Nobody! be not too certain governour,' said Harold, interrupting him, `if there be any thing in it, any thing, that it would harm you to lose, my life on it, Logan knew it, and has won it! Nay,' he continued, `if there was aught in that bag—' `Not a bag, my son, rather a knapsack of curious workmanship.' `It matters not—it matters not. If there be aught within it of surpassing value, or of surpassing mischief, that bag, with all its contents, is at this moment, not only in the possession of Logan, but before the councils of the Creek nation—' Harold was interrupted by the entrance of the messenger, who hesitated, and stammered— `Speak, blockhead, where is it?' said the governour, impatiently. `Gone sir—torn away—nail, arrows, bow, wampum and all.' A low groan issued from the labouring heart of the governour. What had he to apprehend? Nothing. There was nothing to be seen or heard; nothing at which his fears pointed with any certainty, as an evil consequence likely to follow this pillage—and yet there was a feeling of misery, dismay, and perplexity, that was intolerable, attending the discovery. A tear fell upon his hand—he started—`Another civil war,' he articulated, at last, in great perturbation, `another civil war! The red Indian let loose upon us again. Again the mother and babe to feed the flame. The land of the pilgrim again to be polluted with the blood of the innocent and helpless. Oh, God! do thou avert the foreboding!' `But how could he know that these treaties were there,' continued the old man. `They were placed there not two weeks before, with my own hands. It was a secret. I told nobody, and nobody saw me place them there. That knapsack too—it has hung in that very spot, unmolested, unopened, unobserved almost, for half a century—' `Nobody, are you sure that nobody saw you?' `Yes, sure. I hid the papers, it is true, in council, and there were some of my Indian friends about the chamber, but they knew not what I did. The curtain concealed me. The thought of thus securing them occurred suddenly, during the debate, from discovering, by accident, that the Indians regard the loss of a treaty as its destruction. `Indian friends—in council'—muttered Harold. How many, pray—how many were they? Did you know them all? Were they chiefs? warriors?' `Why so eager? But no, I need not ask. Eagerness is constitutional with Harold. What you do, my gallant boy, you always do with all your heart and soul. Your blood vessels are always distended, (smiling and taking his hand)—But stay—' Harold's fine arm lay naked before him. The old man was wondering at the bone and muscle, the swelling and throbbing of the arteries, the animated moving outline, with the feelings of a father, nay, of a painter or statuary. `But stay,' continued the governour, `I cannot call to mind just now, who were present, or how many; my impressions are indistinct. There might be ten or twelve. However, of this I am certain; all that were friendly were there; all! Indeed, I recollect, particularly, that the last of the number came in just as we were dissolving—' `Was it light?' asked Harold, eagerly raising his head from its thoughtful posture. `No, quite dark. We had been detained to an unusually late hour. We could only trace their shapes in deep shadow, and when we separated, I think that I should have found it difficult to distinguish any person across the chamber. `Did you get a glimpse of his face? Did he speak?' `Whose face? Speak? Whom do you mean?' `The last—the last, governor—the last.' `No, I believe not—I do not recollect. But—why, Harold, what ails you? What agitates you so? He kept on the opposite side and stood in the shadow. Nay, I recollect that he stood aloof; but I did not wonder at it. The Indian habits are familiar to me. I know their reserve and haughtiness. I remember too, now that my attention is recalled to the subject, the movements of this one. I remember that he was nearer to me than any other red man—You shudder, Harold—what means this? Who was that Indian? Do you know? Do you suspect? Where were you?' Harold made no answer, except by articulating in a low, troubled, hoarse, and intense whisper— `Look at me. Did he stand thus'—saying these words, he wrapped his panther skin about him, simply throwing the heavy folds over his left shoulder, leaving his right arm free; his neck open, with his right hand thrust into his bosom—his head was depressed at the same moment, and he stood as if equally prepared to strike or fly. `Did he stand thus?' `Exactly! cried the governour in astonishment, darting his eyes rapidly from head to foot of Harold, as if to assure himself that Harold was not the very man. `Who was he? speak.' `Logan.' `Logan! Logan!' echoed, and reechoed the governour again, his voice rising almost into a shriek, in its tone of horrour and dismay. That man, Logan!—and I so near him!—Oh! Oh, curse him, curse him. Accursed be his old age. I shall go distracted. How long has he haunted me? What does he meditate? What?—Tell me Harold; my dear boy, tell me—tell thy old father; but why do I tremble. Art thou not near me? Wilt thou not preserve me? Thou wilt, thou wilt!' The old man hugged him to his heart, while he panted like one that had run a long race upon the very brow of a precipice, and knew not his danger until he had passed it. A moment longer and his self possession returned. The troubled, awful, and preternatural look of terrour in his aged eyes, and contracted front, faded and passed away. `No, no,' he resumed, `Logan is not so fool hardy. He is too wily for that. Alone—alone amid a dozen of his mortal foes—Oh, no, no.' `Governour,' said Harold, after a long pause, with the deepest solemnity, `governour, there is some plot at work. I am sure of it. That was Logan. I am sure of that too. Your life has not been spared twice for nothing. They must have, to a certainty, you, and yours in their power; nothing else could have saved you. There is some secret work of extermination going on. Nay, nay, governour, my father! be not incredulous. I am sure as if the Great Spirit had revealed it to me, sure, sure as if the God of the Christians had told me so, in a dream. Give me a pass. I must be gone again. We must play boldly. Double your watch. Take especial care of yourself. And Oh—(he faultered)—Oh, let the lady governess be sent to some place of safety—embarked, if possible. Give me a pass. Give me one in blank, pledging your word that whoever shall bear it, he shall pass and repass uninjured, unmolested, unquestioned. Something dreadful is at work—some fearful intelligence. There is only one way of averting it. Any attempt to counteract it, now, were vain. Vigilance, courage, conduct, wisdom, are vain, if the match be once applied.' `For what purpose this pass?' `Ask me no questions, governour. You have trusted me before. You shall trust me again.' `Trust thee! trust thee again! Yes, that I will, my gallant, glorious boy—trust thee with my life—pshaw! with mine honour—with the honour of Elvira herself.' The boy trembled from head to foot—seized the hands of the old man, bowed his forehead upon them, kissed them, and pressed them convulsively upon his heart. In fifteen minutes more the passes were signed, countersigned, and Harold was away, away, on his midnight journeying again.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER V. `Thy God shall be my God; and whither thou goest, I will go.' It is the fashion of the age to be superficial and showy. My acquaintance with the languages of the East, could I furnish the printer with their characters, would enable me to illuminate each of my chapters with something abundantly new; but as this would be impossible, I must content myself, in obedience to the childish pedantry of the day, with heading my several chapters from such of the ancient and modern languages of Europe, as the printer can furnish type for. Is it the rare and amazing that are sought for? Would my readers be deluded into a belief that the writer of a novel is profound, learned, acquainted and familiar with the obsolete and unexplored? Let him lift up his eyes. I have quoted from the scriptures; and this, I have done, not in levity, no—but in a feeling of the deepest veneration. Let him look back upon the motto of the last chapter, so thrillingly musical—so tender and touching. That told of constancy, the constancy of earth, of the voluptuary, of the sensualist. This tells of the same virtue. But listen—`Thy God shall be my God! and whither thou goest, I will go! Now look ye through the wide word; through all the volumes of genius, and power, and beauty, and point out to me, even where the most prodigal and adventurous have dwelt upon the virtue of them that `love truly,' and show me aught that can compare with the passionate, sublime, and breathless devotion, the sweet and pure tenderness, the awful yielding up of body and soul, VOL. I. G that are exhibited in that simple line. Oh, such is the love of the pure in heart! It is the love of the married; the hallowed and abiding passion of them, whose embrace is forever and ever; of them, with whom Love is Religion. Harold had been gone a whole week. `I can bear it no longer,' said the governour, traversing his magnificent parlour with a hasty step, and eye constantly fixed upon the distant road, which, for more than three miles, wound about the hills, within sight of his dwelling—`what has become of him?' His anxiety had been growing more and more serious every day, until it was now of the most distressing nature. It was that of a parent, over his own, his only son. He could neither sleep nor eat. `What has become of him,' he would say, twenty times in an hour, with his aged hands locked, and his dim eyes lifted to heaven, `why did I suffer him to leave me?' `I have sacrificed him,' he would continue, `sent him, God himself only knows where, to be butchered and rent by the damnable invention of savages. Gracious heaven! why did I yield? What possessed me? Surely it was infatuation. Why not demand whither he was going, and what his object? And yet, who could refuse him; who fathom his purpose; who dissuade him from the deed of his thought? What a spirit he has! From the first hour that I plucked him reeking from the detestable evidence of slaughter, blood and devastation, in which the poor naked creature was rioting, as in his element, there has always appeared something portentous and preternatural in his ardour, something so heroick and fearless, that I am always quaking for him, always dreading to have him out of my sight. And yet, who may constrain him?—check him— withhold him—and what is the consequence? Is he not always successful? Yea, yea, to all the desperate extremities of success. Then why check him? In sooth I know not. I would not lose him—the fiery creature —childless, solitary as I am—Oh, no, I could not endure that. I could not survive it, and yet, I would rather lose him—would I?—yes I would—than have him grow tamer by inaction Suppose I lose him—lose him—after all my travail, all my labour and prayer for him, so perfectly formed as he is for a great man, so constituted for greatness, and adventure, and authority. Oh, our Father! let me not lose him until I have made him, not a savage, but a christian Hero! If he live, thou knowest, Oh, thou knowest that he will be great. Wilt thou aid me in moulding him to be great and good? The righteous old man fell, involuntarily, upon his knees, with all the ardour of youth, and all the simplicity of manhood; he bowed his head upon his hands, and was praying silently and mightily, like some mother over the son of her old age, praying as David did for his sick child, when the door softly opened, and his young wife entered on tip toe. She was not astonished at what she saw. She did not retreat. The attitude and employment of the old man were intelligible to her, young and beautiful as she was; and he, who had not learnt to be ashamed of being caught at his devotions, never raised his head from his hands, or looked about him, to discover who might be the intruder. She approached, and laid her soft palm upon his forehead: he touched it, and lifted his face, eloquent with meaning, and abundantly more tranquil than she had seen it for days. His was the tranquillity of one suddenly composed, but not violently, in the extremity of his distress, by the natural and becoming expression of his helplessness and dependance. What a picture too for a painter! a gray haired, good old man, upon his knees, before the majesty of Heaven! Her eyes lighted with devotion. He raised his head, folded his arms about the treasure of his soul, and held her to his bosom. What could she reply? Her heart was full. He was her husband. His God was to be her God; and whither he went, there was she to go. She knelt by his side. They bowed together, prayed together, wept together. A warmer, a more intimate and blessed communion, more ethereal, more sublimated, more spiritualized, like sunshine, was felt in both of their natures at the same moment. There was no passion, no fever in it; nothing but a chaste, quiet tenderness, with the most delicate and hallowed emotion, like that of two surviving creatures, purified, and clinging to each other, amid the fiery wreck and whirling desolation of a world. He pressed his trembling mouth to her forehead; and their tears, of thankfulness, fell together upon their locked hands. `Join with me, my beloved,' said he, gently disengaging his arms, `join with me, once more—Let us pray for one that especially deserves our prayer.' Again they knelt—their hands together, upon the same book, and their foreheads bowed at the same altar, together. `Our father who art in heaven!' said the old man, in a tone of thrilling solemnity, `he is in thy care; in the hollow of thy hand; and with thee are all the ends of the earth. Oh, bless him! protect him! restore him to us, Oh, our father! for he is very dear to us. Do thou, Almighty God, thou, who hast endowed and sustained him, hitherto; do thou complete him for the work of emancipation. Strengthen and confirm, we pray thee, the heroick qualities of his nature! Urge him forward with thy chosen impulses, to the great work that thou hast appointed unto him: and Oh, be thou with him, forever and ever! Amen.' Why rose the lady? The prayer was not yet done. Yet her arms have fallen from the shoulders of her lord, and she has risen—her face glowing with—what? Is it the crimson of shame or indignation? Her husband saw it not, nor suspected it, until, in offering some excuse for her momentary forgetfulness, he observed that her voice trembled. `My love,' said he, laying his hand soothingly upon her flushed forehead, and pressing it with the devotion of one who does love—yea, to idolatry, some youthful, and gentle and confiding woman, `My love, I would not reproach thee; cannot rebuke thee—and yet, surely, there is something of levity in this impatience. Is there not?' `Forgive me. I acknowledge it. Nay, I blush for it. Often, Oh, how often, my own, my beloved, have I wept for it. But forgive me. I know you will. Attribute these things to their right cause—my early education—the misfortunes of my (she faultered, and her voice changed)—my house, my change of religious instructors; great constitutional vivacity and imprudence. Many, my good husband, feel as I do, but few dare to act so.' `Ah, Ah! so it is! Your very acknowledgment of errour is a defence, an irresistible defence. Who may assail thee, woman? Nay, who may resist thee. Yes, thou art right, my chosen one. It is thy vivacity that endangers thee. It is thy pride that protects thee. And may I add—that—that—it is thy peculiar spirit of— is it not contradiction—?—that—' `Contradiction! my lord,' she exclaimed, in a tone of affected spirit. Her blue eyes sparkled, and her beautiful lip was put up like that of a spoilt child. `Charge me, a woman, with contradiction! Oh, for the days that have gone by! I am half inclined to charge you with apostacy. Where now is that romantick gallantry of spirit, that old school of chevaliers and chivalry, which captivated me?' Who could scold such a creature, at such a moment? Her round, white, dimpled arms were dangling over his shoulder and breast, and she was peering archly, upward, as he strove again and again to be very dignified, and rebuke her manfully for her pouting. In vain!—he was brought to capitulate, and settle the terms, by another kiss. Every lineament of her face grew luminous with expression and significance. He attempted to pinion her arms; in the struggle to avoid it, her beautiful hair, finer and glossier than the web of the silk worm, broke loose from the blue ribbon, fell and floated all about her naked shoulders, and swelling bosom, which from the nature of her position, and struggling, as she leant backward, were visible for a moment. The governour trembled with delight. Elvira saw the direction of his eyes, and sprang from his embrace, blushing all over, and agitated from head to foot. The pearl clasp at her throat was soon fastened, and she G 2 returned; but her playfulness was gone. Embarrassment, a delicate and scrupulous embarrassment had succeeded. Was it so serious a matter? What else could be expected in a game of romps with an old man? `Yes, love, contradiction,' resumed the governour, `what made thee my wife? contradiction: what made thee abandon the religion of thy fathers? contradiction: what made of you, a very bigotted little catholick (he grew serious): what made you, my love, (the tears filled his eyes) a rank infidel? contradiction.' `True, true, husband. Thank God that I found in you, at last, one whom I could respect and love: one who regarded religion, all religions alike; a thing of the heart, a question between the heart and its Maker. The first man were you, my husband, who cared nothing for ceremony, but every thing for reality. This made me venerate you—love you (there was a slight hesitation as she added the word love: perhaps it was only natural to her as a woman; and perhaps it was only accidental or imaginary—but she appeared to falter). No, I do not believe that contradiction made me an infidel. It appears to me the natural result of a wrong education. I had been taught that many things were serious and sacred, which I afterwards saw derided by my teachers themselves. I joined in the derision. I knew not where to stop. Where was I to distinguish the material, essential religion, from its appendages? Where!—I knew not. I had no guide. Therefore did I scorn it all. My first religion was one of pomp and parade; pictures, pageantry, and robing; incense and chanting: so full of material and magnificence, so sensual, so unspiritual, so ill calculated for abstract and sublimated devotion. These things drove me from the extreme of childish credulity, unthinking and abject, to the contrary extreme of delirious doubt and daring. How often does this happen!' Her large blue eyes were waiting on heaven, and her thin hands were locked and shaking with sincerity. Her husband gazed upon her with such manifest delight and exultation, that, as she withdrew her eyes from above, and caught his countenance, so rapt, so brightening, so glorying, she coloured again with the deepest crimson, and then—as women always do, when detected in any thing especially graceful, she assumed an air of uncommon seriousness; and then, shaking her hair all about her glowing countenance, she cried, `proceed! come, come, go on! This praying—I don't like praying!' `Not like praying!' `No, no, I mean, I mean—I—I don't like petitioning. I cannot bring myself to believe that the Omnipotent, the Omniscient, requires any such audible expression of our desires.' `No!—I am astonished. Is it not appointed to us all? Are we not commanded to pray? Is it not natural? In distress, do we not fly to Him? How often have I seen thee prostrate in the dust for some mercy, unexpected, unhoped for; something that had set thy heart in a flow?—Don't like prayer!' `Such prayer as that! Oh, that's another matter. I do not call that prayer. I call it thanksgiving. I never pray. I cannot pray; that is, I cannot petition for this thing and that, in such a way, and at such a time. I even think that I am doing what is childish, unworthy of my own conceptions of the Deity, as a God and a Father.' (She grew serious and energetick, and her countenance was expressive of the deepest solicitude.) `When I pray in very general terms, as for a blessing upon the whole human family, my country, my friends, some that are gone (a tear fell from her eye), my husband, or for His especial protection, I reflect that all have the same right; and the ear of God I think is not to be won by competition; nor do I believe that his blessings are to be monopolised by prayer. Nay, my good husband, do not look so troubled, I speak with all the sincerity and earnestness of my nature. He will forgive me. I am sure of it. The prejudices of education have their hold upon all of us; upon my husband, I see, as upon his wife.' `But surely I have seen thee pray, with all thy heart and soul. Have we not often prayed together?' `Yes, yes! if that be prayer. When I have been blessed, signally blessed; when something of unexpected good fortune; some rescue from sorrow, sickness, calamity, humiliation, hath happened to some one dear to me, I cannot suppress my emotion. It will come. I could lie down and cry with joy. I could run out into the snow, the water, on the mountain, into the very street, and kneel down and thank my blessed parent, our Father who is in heaven, in tears and trembling, for his goodness and forbearance. Nay, I could rise from my bed at midnight, when the sense of what I was and what I am comes over me, and kneel and pray all night long to him; not for any renewal, not for any especial repetition of his favour, but simply and unaffectedly, in thankfulness, that he has remembered me, and been kind to me, even while legislating for the universe. In one word, my husband, I cannot, will not pray. I will not worry my God with importunity for favours; hut, when they come, I will acknowledge them; and when, in the course of his providence, they are withheld from me, and sorrow and dismay are coming in their stead, I will bear them humbly, meekly. I may cast myself at his feet, but if I do, it will be, not to disarm his visitations of their terrour, but to avert the displeasure of his countenance; not to escape the wrath of an angry God, but to appease the yearnings of a Father.' `I will not petition for favours, because we know not what is good for us; and all the evil passions of our nature are perpetually vociferating about his throne, in one form of entreaty or another, praying for what, if granted, would often be destruction to ourselves or others. In sorrow, in suffering, I will submit. I never did repine, and I believe in my heart that I never shall; and my trials have beeen none of the lightest. Nor will I ever complain, or pray, other than to say `Our Father! thy will be done!' Do thou with us and ours, as it seemest to thee best! This I have said, and this I can say again and again, in the extremity of mortal agony.' The governour shuddered and—embraced her. Oh, well did he call to mind, how resigned she had been, and when, and where. Covered with blood and brains, suffocating amid the slaughtered and dripping remnants of a whole household, he had found her, lashed to a tree, lacerated, exposed, a mark for the levelled rifle, and the hurled tomahawk. Thus had he seen her— and she neither fainted, nor flinched, nor wept! Upheld by her heroick spirit, she never yielded, even in look, until her limbs were unbound, her butchers driven with sword and bayonet down a precipice, and she was once more in safety. Then, and then only, did she tremble; and then, for the first time, were her clear blue eyes full of tears. `To acknowledge the providence of heaven, I cannot believe to be weak or childish, for that does not lead to absurdity. An event having already happened, it must be, because of His permission or appointment, the wisest and best that could have happened; and if it be overpowering, what then? Can we do better than submit? Shall we pray to be set free from the pressure? `in his own good time?' In his own good time, we shall be set free. What is such a prayer, but mocking at the wisdom and stability of God? Are we to divert him from his purpose—turn aside the hand of the Everlasting, while it is dealing out his retribution? Is he to be coaxed or persuaded? Is he to be moved, and can we move him? No—what folly then, what impiety to attempt it! Suppose the occasion, one of transport, rapture. Acknowledge it, pour out your whole soul in thanksgiving. Not that He may be bribed or flattered into a repetion, no; but first, because it is natural, to the pure in heart; it is involuntary, spontaneous, the sublimest instinct of their nature, the unpremeditated, spontaneous gushing of the bosom, appointed by God for our relief, under the weight of his benediction. It is the flow of the grapes from the wine press. The angel treads upon our rebellious nature, his garments saturated and transparent with the immortal spirit that gushes under his feet. This we may do, for it leads to no contradiction, no absurdity, such as follow from petitioning. How often happens it that two nations, or two armies, about to join battle, while the trumpets are sounding for the onset, will beleaguer the throne of heaven with prayer, for the utter wasting and extermination of each other. I cannot endure such things; they shock and alarm me.' `But,' she continued in a sprightlier manner, `where have I rambled? You speak of my spirit of contradiction. You are right. Contradiction is my master spring. To it, all my best and worst actions may be justly attributed. Contradiction led me to scorn and defy all the maxims of religion. The desire of doing what few women could do, what fewer dared to do, hath made me ambitious. Nay more, do you know why I married?' `Elvira,' cried the governour, startled and terrified at her change of countenance, and the abruptness of the question. `I'll tell you. It was contradiction.' She smiled, and that smile brought her husband, almost sobbing, upon her bosom. She continued. `I married, thus, a man older than myself; old enough to be my father—nay, do not look so grave. It is not very gallant I admit, but, after a moment's reflection, you will be surer of me for the very courage that I show in so speaking. It shows that I do not use any deception with myself; that I am accustomed to thinking the plain truth respecting my husband. My affection, therefore, will be permanent. Not being deceived, not deceiving myself, as most people do, when they marry, you have nothing to apprehend from my being undeceived. I speak plainly. It is my duty. Had I shut my eyes to your age when I married you, they must have been opened before now, and it would be no slight symptom of growing disloyalty, if I should affect to keep them shut.' `Elvira—love, do not, you distract me.' `Well then, I married, in contradiction. Few women would have dared the same. I married, because age was every thing to others, nothing to me. I chose a counsellor, a friend, a man; one whom I could respect; one whom others respected; one who could make the whole world respect him and me, wherever we might be thrown. But most of all, I married, to deride the common frailties of my sex, to signify my loathing and detestation of the coxcombs that beset me, presumptuous in their youth and beauty. I hate sensuality—I wedded in spirit. I worship intellect. Why? In contradiction. Were other women intellectually elevated, and could I not outreach them, out-travel them in speculation and purity, I do not know, my husband, but I fear that I should become another Cleopatra—a sensualist—the mistress of Caesars and Antonys.' `Thou! Oh my wife! my wife!' She blushed from head to foot; but the dazzling, terrible light of her eyes, which actually deepened their colour, till they resembled black in their hue and lustre, betrayed an unconquerable earnestness and sincerity. `What a creature art thou,' said the governour, trembling, `verily, I do fear for thee, wife. I shake to hear thee. That ambition, the workings of which, at this moment, are convulsing the fair proportions of thy delicate frame, is so fearful a spirit; so unsparing, in its mastery, that I cannot gaze upon thee, as I do now, without a foreboding that is very dreadful. I cannot sit by thee, and hear thy strange eloquence, the energy of thy tones and action, and see the unnatural brilliancy of thine eyes, the witchery of thy beautiful lip in its quivering excitement, without feeling my heart hurried and accelerated in its motion, contracting and dilating, till I am suffocated and gasping with wild and indefinite apprehension. Would that I were younger, much younger, for thy sake.' `Why so, my husband? I do not wish it. Hadst thou been much younger, I never should have wedded thee.' `Nay, do not reproach me. There is no wickedness, no impurity in my thought. Wife as thou art to me, I cannot but regard thee rather as my daughter; and sometimes—nay, nay, do not hang thy head—what tears! Elvira, forgive me. Thou art my wife; my own beloved, dear, dear girl, the only, only pride and rapture of my aged heart. But what I meant to say was this, (kissing her forehead) were I younger, much younger, I would be thy help mate up some perilous steep; side by side would we clamber the precipitous ascent!—in armour too!—Thou shouldst be there, there! alone, and unapproachable to all but me, thy long hair streaming from the ramparts! God! it were worth ten thousand banners for challenge or invitation!' `My husband my husband! Oh, my blood thrills! Thus it is, that I would hear thee talk! Talk to me thus, and I could listen to thee forever. This it was that conquered me, this! Oh, how well do I remember, child that I was, when I saw thee unhorsed, bleeding, covered with foam and sweat, hewing thy way amid a multitude, a solid multitude, leaping to my first rescue. Oh, no, I cannot forget it, Thy hair was already changing with toil and maturity. Even then, child as I was, I loved thee. From that moment I thought of thee, and dreamt of thee, with passion. How they fell around thee! I can see them now—at this moment, all is before me. I hear thee shouting. I see thee, thee! thy red scarf floating and shining in the wind, and the banner over thee, evolving in thy perpetual evolution, and the sash about thy arm, streaming outward, at every sweep, like spouting blood; and thine eye—the look with which thou didst approach me! Oh, I can see it—feel it now! From that hour, until we were united, I had no other feeling, no other passion or wish than to be near thee, thee, whom I had seen so awful, so undisturbed in battle.' Her husband embraced her. Her panting grew audible, but her glow suddenly faded to an ashy paleness, and she covered her face with her hands, as her husband whispered some low words in her ear, among which could be faintly distinguished—`thou forgettest —no interval—none! Oscar—' She fainted. At this moment a servant entered; and a voice at the door pronounced the following words, hurriedly, and departed. `The council desire a special meeting. They are already assembled.' `How dare you,' said the governour, reddening as he fixed his eye sternly upon the intruder. It was too late. He was gone, as abruptly as he came. `Curse that fellow, I must have him out of the army. He is rude to me, from his hatred to Harold. This is the second time, and the last.' `Begone,' said he to the servant, turning toward the pallid countenance at his side, and wiping off the large tears that hung upon the lashes of his beloved—`Begone, and send your lady's woman.' Saying this, he threw himself upon his knees beside his wife. She opened her eyes a little; her lids quivered, and a faint respiration followed. So intense was his watchfulness, that he would hardly have heard a pistol, had it been let off at his ear. He was recalled by a movement near his shoulder. He leaped upon his feet! His chamber—his very refuge and hiding place, the sanctuary of his household, was crowded with strange people! He started, frowned, covered his face with his hands, and turned to rebuke them. They were gone! What were they? Noonday apparitions, with ferocious looks and strange dresses. Had he seen them before? Yea, and his knees smote together at the recollection.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER VI. A nava rotta ogni vento é contrario. Was the mind of the governour shipwrecked? or why was it, that, amid this pressure and whirl of calamity, every movement was attended with a renewal of distress? The spectres that had filled his room, and walked round him with their arms folded—what were they? The old man was not superstitious, but he shuddered, as he recalled to mind that, once before, as he stood upon a broken cliff overlooking the water, immediately VOL. I. H after his arrival in America, all alone, and in the brightness of noonday, he found, on lifting up his head from a posture of profound meditation, he found himself encompassed with a multitude of strange faces. He shouted, and they vanished! A bloody war broke out, ere the moon changed; and the portentous visitation was followed by the ravaging of his possessions—the pillage of his dwelling, the slaughter of his household—the captivity of his wife—his Elvira,— whom he rescued, amid fire and smoke, upon that very precipice where he had been beset by shadows, just as she had been stripped and bound, naked and helpless, to a young sapling, and left to swing over a frightful chasm, in the wind, while the accursed Indians levelled their rifles, and whirled their tomahawks at her, in mere wantonness. Yes, yes, his blood curdled—what new calamity portended this fearful apparition? Where was it to happen? Where was he to encounter it? Not, Oh God! not, as it would seem, in the very spot where they had appeared to him, in his bed-chamber, in the very solitude and sanctity of his retirement, the hallowed and consecrated place of his affections! Oh, let it not be there. Look where he would, there was no comfort for him. Should he anticipate the savages? or should he lie still, and abide their assault? Should he despatch messengers for Harold? or should he subdue his inquietude and pray for his return? Indeed he knew not. The times were of that apalling nature, that he feared to decide. Do what he would, destruction and fire must follow. Harold had been gone a whole week; no tidings, none. What could have happened? `The boy is too full of adventure, too rash, headstrong,' thought the governour, again and again. `Of what use are wisdom and experience to such creatures? I forget mine, the moment that I hear the deep, tremulous agitation of his voice, or see the keen glancing of his eye. Heaven forgive me! But if he return—Great God! he must return— he shall, he shall. Father, forgive me! Bless me once more with the sight of him, and he shall never leave me again, never! (in a lower voice) never, in so wild and unknown an adventure.' It was true that Harold had appointed a time for his return. That time had not yet elapsed, but why no message from him? Good or evil, we know not of aught that hath betided him, and besides, can his return be depended on—would he be punctual? was such a creature, ringing his alarums, and bounding away, at every impulse, was he to keep time, and march like clock work? as well might ye listen for tunes from the wild harp ringing in the wind of heaven. Ask ye the Eolian Lyre to keep touch and time with the science of earth, and then look to Harold for like obedience! The council assembled. It was the eighth day of Harold's absence. They were busy in conducting a negociation with certain friendly chiefs, then in town; some of whom were at the council, sitting upon matts, with their legs across, and their stern countenances composed to the unrelenting expression of their characters:—immoveable, passionless. Heavens! what a picture!—Beings of whirlwind and flame; they, in whose bosoms the most deadly and unsparing thoughts are forever concocting their venom, and writhing and coiling—they!—seated around the council fire, meditating carnage, war, peace, death and annihilation—they wear, for ever and ever, the same brown and settled motionlessness. Creatures of bronze, with hearts of lava! Beings, over whose fiery and whirling material, a crust only has been formed! who shall read them? who fathom them? The eye, that mirror of the soul—ye may search it with the fascination and power of the basilisk, the beam of inquiry comes back, like an arrow shot, heedlessly, against something of polished and glittering adamant—blunted—pointless—shattered! The lip—there is no curling, no writhing, no scornful lifting of that most expressive feature; no!—but shut firmly, and fixed, as if it were sealed; and all beneath were death or torpor. Wo to the watchers of signs and symptoms! The brow—who shall measure the amplitude of an Indian thought, by the sweep and fashion of his brow? Who shall tell, by studying him, if his nature sleep, or, like the whirlwind, is already on the wing? Eye, lip, and brow! what are they to him who would gaze upon, and read the meditation of an Indian, even in his most unguarded moment? Nothing—nothing! a mockery, a defiance. Alike in sorrow and in shame; in wrath, the fiercest and fellest. Alike in the unimaginable battle— in night and tempest—in peace and war—in bloodshed and in hunting. Alike at all times, at all seasons, in all ages, in all trials, and under all temptations! How, then, shall you read the Indian? You may not. You are only set to beware of a growing loneliness, a more inscrutable serenity; for these increase, as the moment approaches which is about to tear up your foundations like a mine—prostrate and scatter your strong places, like a hurricane. Watch him in his hour of festivity. Does he abstain from strong drink? Beware! Does he sit alone—avoiding with a little more than his habitual seriousness, all communion? shunning, with an appearance of accident, his chosen companions? Beware! He would lull you. The plot is gathering. It will burst in thunder. Some of these inscrutable beings were seated about the chamber. A stranger's voice was heard at the landing. They turned not, spoke not, made no sign; but the eyes of each, like those of the rattle snake, were glittering toward the entrance. The voice was rude and heavy, and the demand for admittance was made with the emphasis and bearing of authority. It was refused. Two or three loud words were heard—a blow—a shout! and something fell heavily against the door. It yielded, and a man, a soldier, staggered into the room, reeling under the effect of a tremendous blow. He was followed by a fierce, tall savage. The hand of every Indian was instantly upon the hilt of his ornamented knife, and his limbs were contracted, and gathered beneath him, as preparing to leap upon his feet. The whole council rose from their chairs. Tomahawks were grappled; and the working of restrained muscular force could be distinctly seen, beneath the pacifick folding of some arms. The guard at the landing, angry at the treatment of their comrade, who had been ordered to admit nobody, but by a special order, were following up the stranger with looks full of menace and determination; and the governour, who never went unarmed after the interview with Logan, placed his hand calmly, but resolutely, upon the trigger of a horse pistol before him. The stranger walked forward. He stood face to face with the governour, in the very centre of the chamber, unmoved, unarmed, unintimidated by all this threat and preparation. `Who are you?' said the governour. The stranger threw down a folded paper upon the table. It was handed to the governour. An exclamation broke wildly from his lips. He looked at the stranger with terrour and admiration; measured him from head to foot. Suddenly, why does his countenance change? Does he recognise him? He does! and the sweat starts out upon his forehead. His lip quivers, and he half raises his pistol. The stranger made a correspondent motion, and threw his eyes with the avidity and effect of lightning, first at the governour, then, at the council, the Indians, the guard, and the door. What sympathy! as he moved, they moved, and the faces about him waxed pale and deathly, like countenances seen through a vapour— his form seemed to contract and dilate, and the blood and breath rattled in his chest? What did he meditate? We know not. He was not put to the trial. `I desire a private conference,' said he. The governour's eyes rolled in their sockets, at the sound of his voice, and he could hardly suppress a deep groan. He was on the point of refusing, with violence; but a moment's reflection, and another glance at the immoveable features before him, convinced him that he would be as safe alone, as with all his council and troops about him. `Gentlemen,' said he, turning solemnly to the board, in a firm voice, `we will meet again this evening.' They departed. The Indian H 2 chiefs rose, but, looking at each other, hesitated to follow. The governour thanked them with his hand, and signified that he would not profit by their protection. Still there was a lowering, a manifest unwillingness to depart, in their manner. They went, however: but the governour observed, and his blood ran cold at the sight, a secret and terrible brightning of the eye, exchanged between two of the youngest, both of whom, at the same moment, made a significant motion of the foot. Quicker than lightning, the stranger made a correspondent motion. He reddened—his bosom heaved, and he stamped with vexation. What could this mean! The governour was not certain, but yet it appeared to him that there was some interchange of dreadful thought, between the retiring chiefs; a sort of malicious triumph, as of discovery, in their manner. He felt a growing concern for the life of his brave, but implacable enemy, and determined to apprise him of what he had seen. Another glance—the secret was his own. This stranger was no Indian. It had been discovered by the position of his feet. There was the mystery. He had forgotten to turn them inward; and, therefore, had belied his costume. `Your business, sir. Be brief,' said the governour. An angry and quick motion of the stranger's arm made him recoil, as he answered—`You know me governour.' `Yes,—Logan'—was the reply. `Logan, among the red men.' `I understand you, governour. The red men are my brothers. Very well. In ten words then—I am Logan. I would marry a I ogan. The tribe refuse. They are your mortal enemies. They are afraid of you. They are able, with my assistance, to lay waste the village of every Indian ally that you have on earth. Now! will you be at peace with them? If yea, there are your treaties. If no, the tomahawk.' `Answer me, I have no time to lose. Before another sun, your answer is enregistered. There will be no appeal. Peace or war? If yea, we, I, I will fight for you, die for you. If no, mark me—another moon— you and your whites—every man of them, are swept from the earth Mark me. I know it. I say it. And you know me, me! I would weep at your ruin—but that time has gone by. I have shed my last tears. I shall never weep again. No! not, if the heavens were melting above me, and the earth were running with blood. Enough; another moon, and not a white man breathes within our ancient hunting ground; no woman; no infant—none! within the circumference of our dominion—the two oceans—Another moon—ye are exterminated, extinct, forgotten! What say you?' `I can save you, I, alone. At my intercession, you are spared till now. Think not that I shall relent. No, I owe no allegiance to aught but the red men. Pity to the whites, though my veins may be infected with their detestable blood, pity to them, were treason to the God of the Indians.' `Be at peace with us. I will marry a Logan. I will be your friend, your friend! as I have been your enemy. You understand me. And look you here, governour; we have known each other before—our fathers too— but that is passed. I have forgotten that—with this very arm! ay, by this very hand, the blood of your dearest, your best beloved on earth, shall mingle with your own. Am I to be eluded? Did I ever threaten, but the deed followed? Yea, governour, ere another moon, your children, your little ones (his voice faltered) from the north to the south, from the east to the west, with all their white habitations, shall lie smoking and even with the earth. What say you?' `To-morrow, I will reply.' `To-morrow, ha! ha! ha!' shouted the imperious stranger. The governour's hair rose upon his head—his chest rattled—He stood gasping with rage and horrour.' `Devil!—Thou fiend of hell,' he cried—`Thy voice hath betrayed thee again! Was it indeed thou, and thy bloodhounds, that leaped the precipice before our bayonets?' Another laugh! The governour would have pistoled him on the spot. But Logan sternly put the muzzle aside, and answered, coldly, carelessly— `Yes! It was I, I that sacked your dwelling. I, that saved your wife. Why I did it, I know not. It was an impulse. She was naked, bound, when I discovered her. I claim no merit for what I did, but I was reeking and weary with the blood of men, your bravest and best; and I was sickening with that of women. Therefore, I gave you the intelligence that I did—at the wood—' `You—was that you?' `Yes. Would you know the full weight of your obligation? I owed you a favour. You know what it is. While you did your duty, I did mine. It was I that ran to you amid a shower of bullets, to tell you where we lay. it was I, too, that, at the hazard of my neck, leaped a precipice when you approached us so rashly. It was I, too, that prevented an ambuscade on your return, in which you would infallibly have perished. There! are you weary? nay, nay, release my hand. I am satisfied. You owe me nothing. I only ask you to behave like a man. Your answer.' `To-morrow.' `To-morrow again! Governour are you possessed. (His face wrinkled with mockery and scorn.) To-morrow, man!—there is no to-morrow for you. To-night, this very night, nay, this instant!—now, now, here on this spot, you must determine! What say you? Yea or nay?' `Logan,' said the governour, with a steady and solemn voice. `You have prevailed!—Yea!' Logan was affected. He stood subdued for a moment—The awful magnanimity of a great heart, in its extremest agony, affected him. `Logan,' resumed the old man, `there's my hand. I tell thee, for I do know thee, that I do not believe thee, to the full extent of thy tremendous denunciations; but yet I do know thee. Thou wondrous and terrible spirit—so erring and luminous—I do not believe what thou sayest—but I believe that thou believest it. Will that appease the growing menace of thy front?' Logan turned away from the steady and great aspect before him, borne up on an equality with his own, by a frame as majestick as his own, even in its decay. It was the countenance of one intent on martyrdom. A sudden shivering ran over him, from the crown of his head to the sole of his foot; and his heart bounded against his Indian breast plate of ornamented silver: and there was a gasping, for a moment, as of intellectual suffocation, in his strong breath—his voice died away, and his face was hidden in the lifted folds of his panther skin. `Governour,' said he, at last, raising his locked hands—`Governour! (his voice was inconceivably tremulous and broken, but solemn and deep; a voice, that even in its whispering, sounded like the efforts of an imprisoned tempest to escape, and rage and devastate)—`governour, enough, enough! (he grasped the old man's hand, and held it to his hot, throbbing temples) you have saved your life, your own life—the life of your adopted—even, her!—that of your wife: ay!'— (a pause)—`and—and—though I have hitherto cared little for the boon—you have saved my life; and it is welcome to me now! But you assent;' (he grew more intensely energetick and fixed in his manner, hurrying as he proceeded, till his voice became thrilling in its elevation and cadence beyond all enduring,) `but for your assent, this very hand,' (he extended his arm before him, as he continued, stretching the fingers as if he felt them sticking together with blood, as far apart as he could, and gazed on them, with a mingled expression of melancholy and desperation,) `this very hand, this very night too, had been besmeared again—again, with the blood of old age and infancy! Yea, but for this treaty,' he continued, stooping and whispering to the governour—`old man, thus made with me, by a single word I had been—nay thou, thou thyself hadst been, the murderer of hundreds—of whom?—of thy countrymen—our countrymen!' `Our countrymen! gracious heaven! how? where?' It was too late. Logan was gone. His strong bound rang for a moment, like the sound of one leaping in armour and harness upon his naked feet, down the broad stair case, and then, like the reiterated tramp of an unshod war-horse, at his fiercest speed; and then, with three or four clattering reverberations, it died away in echoes. Logan hath cleared guard and guard house, watch and watchman, steel and ball!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER VII. `But thou!—from thy reluctant hand, The thunderbolt was wrung. Byron `Down! down to hell!—' `A Dios, amado!.... Yo me muero... Recibid mi postrer aliento!' `He died—I dare not tell thee how; But look!—tis written on my brow. Thus Logan, the formidable Logan, departed. But his steps were watched. Familiar with peril, strong to a miracle, and subtle as the wariest, he was about to encounter now, what even to him would be a terrible adventure:—he was about to wrestle, for life and death, with fully his match in courage, more than his equals in cunning, and more than his peers in force. There was at this time, at Jamestown, on an embassy from a distant tribe, three blood relations, chiefs of high name and rank, and warriours, alike remarkable for their youthful impetuosity, their resolute intrepidity, and their lofty bearing on all occasions. There was wisdom on their forehead, and experience in their eyes. They had been companions in every terrifick inroad upon the whites, from their very boyhood: they had fought and bled—been wounded and captured, side by side; and side by side, had they burst asunder the frail ligatures, that were wreathed and knotted about them, at the same moment. At the same moment too, had they wiped away the reproach of captivity, dipping their rent bands in the hearts' blood of their enemies. Had the lightning itself, blazed down upon them, and had those bands been made of the untwisted flax, their liberation could not have been more sudden and terrifick. They arose in their strength; and lo! the blood fell like rain upon the earth; and their foes—were a heap of ashes! They returned with the scalps of their white conquerors; and their countrymen were willing to believe that their very captivity was only a new and terrible stratagem! These young men belonged to the Five Nations, a confederacy just at this time at the height of its power, from the admission of a sixth, and an unsparing triumph over the Mohawks. They had, like the Romans, driven their chariot wheels over all that impeded their course to dominion, and like the Romans too, had successively incorporated their ememies, people after people, with themselves. These young men, the Horatii of the wilderness, were not only related by blood, but educated together in the most trying habits of association and rivalry, each having a property in the reputation of his two brothers, for so they were called and known, and so they were! Brothers indeed they were, and the band that bound them had been, thrice and again, swathed about them in blood. Side by side, so often, and in such vicissitude had they striven and wrestled, that each had aided and been aided, in some mortal extremity, by the others; either when the paw of the wild beast was upon him, or the hot breath of a panting enemy. Yes, the Horatii of the western world were they! not brothers by birth, but brothers more nearly and dearly allied—brothers by blood and in blood. One of them was at the council when Logan appeared. His carria e was too abrupt, and it excited some suspicion. His countenance was not Indian. His tone and look were not Indian. Yama saw that. But, if not Indian, what was he? Who was he? Whence was he? He watched him, every motion and look, with a deadly eagerness; his hand half hiding his face, and his eyes glittering through his smooth brown fingers. He was breathless; but no sign of impatienace did he betray. Twice did he feel secretly for his knife, and twice he relented, and his fingers relaxed in doubt. Once the tomahawk trembled in his grasp, but nobody saw it, even the Indians about him saw it not, so deep and awful were the silence and attention, caused by the unshaken, stern composure of Logan. Long and fixedly did Yama regard him; long and anxiously, but in vain. Was the stranger so consummately guarded? That Yama had seen him, somewhere, in the chase, or council, or battle, or embassy; and that he had been with him, somewhere, side by side, or with one like him, not many winters before, he felt assured. But when? where? He could not answer that. His mind was troubled. An Indian never forgets; and yet, Yama could not remember this. Forever and ever, would the time and place escape the tenacity of his grasp; and yet—indistinct, and unsatisfactory as was the impression, still it had been made with a humour so acrid that his heart bore it yet. He felt that the stranger, be he who he might, was his mortal foe. But, was he a white man? His hair was black, glossy, not straight like the Indians of the north, but waving and thick and short, and gathered about his neck, like some of the Southern Creeks. His naked throat, and strong muscular chest were of the deepest brown. Was it by the sun and wind? He kept his eye upon him, dissatisfied, anxious, baffled. The signal of departure was given by the governour. It was fatal to the concealment of Logan! In turning and stopping, the position of his feet was forgotten. He was betrayed! The dark countenance of the Indian lightened outright! A glance of electricity shot from eye to eye, and the whole embassy departed. Logan saw it all! Did his heart sink? No, no! His heart never sank. Did his eye quail? No, never! his was not the eye to quail, even to the fiercest light of the sky. He was Indian—Indian! body and soul! heart and spirit! blood and thought. There was no gesture: but his whole constitution was up in arms. `I am betrayed,' thought Logan, and a mortal coldness pressed upon his bosom for a moment, as he half drew a pistol from his side, with the purpose of avenging himself on the governour. His next impulse was to fly—to fly! Remember that the Indian bolds it folly to be slain, madness and imbecility to be taken, and disgrace to be wounded. A single Indian practises, in the simplicity of his nature, what the highest refinement of military art teaches, that it is the perfection of a warlike nature to do to its enemy the greatest possible harm, with the least possible injury to itself. Hence discipline, entrenchments, stratagems; hence the law of war—the taking of prisoners—and the science of defence: nay, all the accomplishments of the soldier, or the general. Logan fled. Anon was heard the quick bending and shaking of the distant boughs, that stretched over the narrow and solitary path by the river's brink, the place for slaughter and assassination, and, therefore, chosen by Logan, who thought that his enemy would probably look for him, or be in wait for him, in some safer route. With a strong arm, and a vigorous movement, Logan tore away all obstructions from his unfrequented path, disentangling and rending the locked branches, like one who sports among twisted garlands, or bounds through a flower-woven lattice. He had already matured his plan of escape. His life was inexpressively dear to him just now, and a wild horse, without saddle or bridle, which he had left tied to a tree at a little distance, was already in sight. `Some may pursue me even here,' thought Logan. `Their rifle balls may be too swift for me.' He cleft the rope that bound the young horse, and struck him a blow that sent him headlong, tearing, and plunging through the forest. Logan was right. The sudden crash and crackle of the underwood was speedily followed by a shot!—another!--a third!—In vain--`away went the bridleless steed!' and anon, under the blue lustre of a cold summer sky, where the river turned aside in the moonlight, at a great distance, something leaped downward, as from a precipice—a shadow—as of a horse—and thundered into the dim water! It was a black spot for a moment— VOL. I. I another shot!—and two figures emerged from the wood, and stood erect, at the extreme turn of the river, while a third was visible from a high rock, that overlooked the very spot where Logan stood. Quick gestures were interchanged, and one of the distant figures ran down and leaped into the water, swam the bend, and emerged at a place much nearer Logan, as if to intercept the horse, that was heard, coursing along the high bank opposite. Nothing could be seen in the deep blackness, caused by the overhanging branches, but an uninterrupted sound was heard, as of a young animal spent with fatigue, snorting, and plunging, in the darkness. But whither have fled the other two shadows? Could they have guessed the plan of Logan? That were hardly possible. But, when the horse swam the stream, was any one of them near enough to see that there was no rider upon his back? If so, were they not looking for him in the wood—hoping to find him beaten off by the blow of some intercepting branch, in his headlong course? His anxiety became intolerable. They might double upon his track like hell-hounds. They might be already at his side! At this instant, the rifle might be levelled at him from some of the near bushes! He shuddered at the thought—and bent his body involuntarily—he turned—an uplifted weapon glittered in its motion!—he started—a hatchet whirled past his head. His foe was there!.... Logan was upon him! An instant, a silent single instant, and a human trunk rolled downward from the rock, to the edge of the water—its head in the calm moonlight—the blood gushing out of its throat, and ears, and nostrils—the eyes starting from their sockets! what had smitten him?—the hand of Logan!—It was a corpse. Not a sound escaped it. Again and again he had driven his dagger into the side of the giant that grappled his throat, but Logan moved not, relaxed not, relented not, till he saw the swollen eye balls bursting with blood, and the rattling of suffocation was heard in his chest. Logan rose, with the knee that he had planted upon the dead man's bosom, yet bent, and senseless with the excess of his effort. He grew faint—as the body tumbled heavily down the green slope, with its long black hair winding round and round its throat, as it rolled. God of heaven! can death be so terrible! Hitherto Logan had derided it. Now, he quaked at the thought. Often had he sought Death, but the capricious tyrant always fled from him. He had pursued him. He had ransacked his habitation, the sepulchre, like a misanthrope, dwelling alone amid the abominations of that hateful, horrible place. He had plunged into pestilence and fire. He had sought the spectre throughout all the vicissitudes of battle after battle, rout and storm, hunted him in darkness and in daylight, breast to breast, lip against lip, the distended nostril reddening with the vitality of an exploded and bursting heart—when his very hair was tangled and matted with the hair and blood of successive foes, and yet, Death had always laughed his presence to scorn, keeping forever near him, to appal and distress him with his fell visage, and the skeleton rattling of his joints, and forever beyond his reach. And now, now! when he no longer sought him, but shunned him; when his life had ceased to be hateful to him, and something innocent and beautiful, with weeping eyes, and gentle lips, was constantly swimming round and round him; now! when his misanthropy had departed from him; when humanity had stolen back to his heart, `like a naked, new born babe,' and was playing with the stern panoply of his bosom —the terrible harness of his spirit—while the sunshine was upon it, for the first time, and the rain of heaven was washing off the blood, and his great heart was swelling, for the first time too, with the awakened godliness of its nature—Oh it was dreadful, dreadful, to be smitten so horribly! to be so tempted and beset. It was death, death! in all its horrour and bitterness! `I am very faint,' said Logan, leaning against a tree, and averting his face from the blackened and convulsed features before him. The lips appeared to move— the chest heaved! He covered his face with his hands. Again he looked. All was deathlike, silent, motionless. `It was the shadow of some moving branch of the flexible high tree, upon the rock above, or some leaves detached in the wind,' said he. Logan sank down upon the spot. He had not the power to tear himself away; or even to change his position. The ghastly lineaments could not be shut out. They were forever before him. Turn which way he would, with his shut eyes; quivering swollen lips, naked teeth, and clotted blood were pressing against his face: a hateful, detestable vapour rose, like a hot steam, about him. He felt pressed down and weighed upon by a contracting solidity, as of massy walls, like a prison, shutting him in on all sides, and compressing his huge frame as into a mould. Why should he abide there? He put out his hands, with a feeling of desperation; the time seemed an eternity that had already passed, he continued groping, but there was all about the smoke of wrath and blood—was some one breathing upon his forehead? No—his hair was moved by the wind— was the very atmosphere, which his extended fingers encountered, in his blindness and horrour, was it stagnant and sticky with murder? He shuddered and drew them back:—they were unwiped, and the clammy moisture of death was upon them. He groaned aloud. He would have given the world, in this unparalleled self-abandonment, to hear the sound of a human voice, the voice even of his mortal foes. Such were his feelings for a while. Gradually he became more composed. His strength returned. He uncovered his eyes. The deadly sickness of his heart had passed off. But still—still!—there were the ghastly and distorted features before him—`Almighty God! they are approaching!' he cried. Logan leaped from his seat—reeled and fell. It was a delusion. His enemy was dead—dead beyond the reach of mercy or hope. Logan grew more and more master of himself in the interval that followed. He wondered at the deadly fascination that had held him, in such tremendous thraldom too, so long. `Oh,' he cried, his damp forehead leaning against a tree, `Oh, where art thou, love! Already, already my faint spirit is abroad for thee! I am dying. Oh, where art thou? Let me adjure thee in the language that thou lovest. Yo me muero!... A Dios! A Dios, amado... Yo me muero!....' His head sank down upon his bosom. His deep voice died away in tones of the most heart felt, and thrilling tenderness. What a season! The awful solemnity of the hour; the unbounded blue of the firmament; the utter stillness and lifelessness of every thing in heaven and earth—a dying man and a dead one—the murdered and the murderer—one, in his mortal agony, and the other already arraigned before the Eternal!—at this moment —this! receiving his sentence, and beckoning to his murderer. `Oh, where art thou, my beloved! Hast thou forgotten thy promise? Art thou near me?' continued Logan in tones of unparalleled solemnity and sweetness. Where had all this musick slumbered during his life? So thrilling! So mournful! It were hard to resist— though the green turf lay upon her bosom, and the ocean rolled between his beloved and him. The incantation of a broken heart hath a forlorn and unearthly witchery in it, when its strings are damp with the dews of death. `Hast thou too, abandoned me! Art thou, too, gone, gone, forever gone?' He raised his head wildly, `where am I?—Speak— what art thou! Comest thou'—his voice faltered—he strove to arise. The heavens grew darker for a moment; and he went on. `My country! Oh, who but me could have wrought thy deliverance? By whom shall it now be wrought? Dying, dying!—no creature that hath life and motion near me. No living creature! nothing to wreak my vengeance upon, nothing.' He ground his teeth in fury and wrath, and fell upon his face, and rolled, in his utter helplessness, and insensibility, till his face almost touched that of the dead man. At this instant he opened his eyes—he shrieked, and his shriek was re-echoed, on all sides, above and below, with stunning and horrible loudness—he had not the strength to rise, but he crawled away, bleeding all the while, upon his hands and knees. `Ha! where am I,' said he again, as a rustling passed near him, and he I 2 awoke, all at once, as from a blinding trance. The sound died away gradually in the wind. Another shot rang in the air above him, and some dry leaves fell wheeling and eddying from the rock over his head, and settled upon his face, as he was looking upward. A plunge followed. The chase still continued. The colt was wounded. He had been hunted up and down the river bank, during the temporary delirium of Logan. `It grows dark,' thought he, `they will forbear.' At this moment, the spent and exhausted animal appeared directly in front of Logan, near the middle of the stream, aiming at the very spot where he lay, helpless and bleeding. It was the nearest, and shelving. Logan's shriek had betrayed him—But, at the same moment, the echoes that followed had roused in him a preternatural spirit of resistance. He was prepared; come what, come would, he was prepared. `They pursue thee, my steed,' cried Logan, staunching his wounds with green herbage and moss, and leaning against a rock; his mighty heart swelling with ungovernable agony and wrath. `If they pursue thee here, woe to thee! woe to me! woe to them! God grant they may, while I have life enough left to requite their visitation. Daughter of Castile, I shall yet perish worthy of thee! Home of my fathers! I curse thee again and again! accursed by thy name and history! Home of my adoption! Oh, may heaven bless thee! Thou art blessed; for the last breath of a dying man hath blessed thee. I fled, I fled, my beloved, from the deadly combat. I fled—canst thou forgive me? wilt thou? But for thee, as thou art revealed anew in Loena, I had not been a coward—my manhood had not departed from me. A woman, a child, hath done, what many men have failed to do. My soul trembled, and was faint before thy resemblance, and I fled, because I saw the spirit of my beloved passing before mine eyes. I saw—and the loftiness of Logan's nature fell down upon its face, and worshipped in the dust. Let me redeem myself—' A crash in the air over him followed:—a damp sullen echo succeeded, with the wrenching of boughs, as of some one swinging and descending by the branches, from the top of the precipice. A leap—whatever it was, it had landed. Logan turned his eve toward the place—he could see nothing—but his rifle was raised to his cheek; and his body concealed behind the rock. Something, or somebody had certainly alighted from the beetling cliff above. Was it an animal? A creature of prey would not have missed him. An Indian? A foe? were there more than three? It was not dark. A cloud was over the moon; and the star light shining, in scattered and tremulous spots, upon the near water, filled all the atmosphere with a dim, fluctuating, faint radiance, giving to all material things a visionary, moving and dreary aspect. Yet Logan, whose well trained eye and ear could hear, and see, what might escape many others at such a season, held his breath, and brought the breech of his rifle closer to his cheek. Something was certainly near him. Life and death were on the moment. He fired!—Was that a reverberation? Impossible! so clear, sudden and distinct. Were there two shots? Whence came the other? There was no ringing in the interval between them? Were there two? He listened. There was a suppressed breathing very near him. He could hardly support himself. The instant that he had fired, he had attempted to leap aside, knowing that the flash and sound of his piece would direct the aim of his enemy, if his shot had not brought him down. He had attempted this, but in vain—he was too powerless—he fell upon his hands. Many and deep were the wounds in his side; and if his enemies were not speedily upon him, the bleeding man felt that he should go, unaccompanied, to the world of spirits. He grasped a pistol and a dagger yet. The moonlight shone out again, coldly and damply—another shot—at his very elbow—and a man threw himself upon him! Now then for the retribution. The struggle of death was renewed. Whoever was his enemy, he was wounded: for the blood trickled down upon Logan as he wrestled, with his face upward, against his incumbent and unknown visitor. In his hornour and convulsion, Logan, in his turn, strove again and again to, but he could not, it was impossible, though his heart burst in the spasm, he could not drive the dagger home. It went wide of its mark, and the spouting blood blinded and strangled him with its loathsome heat and foam, as it rattled upon his forehead and lips like a thick heavy rain. They struggled, and rolled and wrestled, and blasphemed together: their strong limbs were locked and rivetted; and the hands of each were in the thick hair of the other—their very faces were pressed furiously together at times. This new enemy was strong, very strong—but what mortal force could resist Logan, in his desperation? Bound as he was; bleeding and sick at heart as he was—delirious, and weary with slaughter—choaking with horrour and hate —and prone upon his back, with an unseen, unknown enemy planted upon his breast—even thus, Logan was never so formidable! His heart heaved—his chest dilated—his arteries were ruptured with the breath that he drew in—he was upon his knees—his feet—and lo!— his antagonist, prostrate and senseless—dashed and broken—a mass of bones and quivering flesh—lies heaped upon the rock below! The laugh of a demon broke from Logan, as he staggered toward the body. The triumph strung him anew. Once more the thought of life came over him. A preternatural vitality thrilled anew in his cold arteries. He rose, walked, nay almost ran, but unsteadily, and reeling from faintness, through the underwood of the river path, now knee deep in the river on his left, and now running against the sharp rocks upon his right, with one hand upon his side, covering his wound, and the other feebly extended to grapple at every encountering branch. A shadow moved before him as he emerged to the open sky. Was it his own? It was no time for combat. His rifle was gone; his tomahawk; he had only a knife, hot and smoking. He shuddered. A cold damp gathered upon his heart. `Must I die now?' said Logan. `I cannot, I cannot! thrice have I escaped,' It was not his own shadow. It approached. He threw himself into the river. His dress was heavy. He was weary indeed, and the current strong. It drove him back, after a few struggles, back as he felt to the place of sacrifice! Gradually, slowly, he felt himself borne onward to the feet of the Avenger. There he stood, dark and stately, ready to greet him, and awaiting his approach. Was he superstitious? Whence the mortal coldness that ran through his shivering arteries? He was utterly subdued—utterly, for the first time in his life. He touched the shore—he fell upon one knee, and covered his face with his discoloured hands, as awaiting the thunder. How his stout heart battled against his ribs! A strong upward rushing was heard, as of some unearthly thing in its ascent. A voice addressed him! He raises his head. The shadow hath vanished. He lifts it yet higher. Why leaps he upon his feet? Why stands he with outstretched arms, gazing upward with his bloody and gashed forehead, wild and melancholy eyes—naked bosom, and clotted hair—motionless, in the beautiful moonlight! Why!—look ye upon that cliff!—there! there! It scarcely touches the earth! Logan is prostrate in the dust—borne down with perturbation and horrour. The voice sounded again, and a footstep approached. With unspeakable apprehension Logan turned aside his worn and ghastly countenance. Why was it so pale? Whence that hue of a drowned man? Hath the water purified it? `Red man, or white?' said the voice. `Red—red,' cried Logan, starting upon his feet, shouting and staggering wildly, towards the sound. It was a Shawanese that spoke! and tears—yes tears gushed from the eyes of Logan, as he answered, gasping for breath—`Red, red, red.' `Logan!—can it be!' answered the voice, and at the same moment, a shadow dashed out of the thick underwood, threw aside a rifle, and leaped down at the very side of Logan—face to face. Logan had well nigh driven his knife through another human heart, in the first shock of his surprise, but something withheld him. The youthful aspect and graceful, fearless carriage of his new visitor disarmed him of all but caution. Nevertheless, he brandished the knife, planted the foot, and awaited the result. `Another,' whispered Logan faintly, as he pointed to the cliff. A tall shadow stood there waving its arms. Logan bowed thrice, and folded his upon his breast. A sudden light flashed about the brow of the cliff, and trembled for a moment on the blood shot eyes, and throbbing temples of Logan. He looked up again, dazzled and apalled. The spectre had vanished. `Who art thou, boy?' `I am Harold,' was the reply, `there's my hand.' `Boy! boy!' said Logan—there was a thrilling earnestness and solemnity, in the continued adjuration—of `boy! boy! boy!—Oh, God, I thank thee! Comest thou as friend or foe? `Friend for to-night. Whence art thou? Whither?' Logan threw himself upon his bosom. `I am wounded, dying; my path is beset—I—' The words had hardly passed his lips, when his hold relaxed, and he was sinking to the earth. A voice, as of lamentation, was heard at a distance. It approached. It became fierce and more angry, and continually changed, as if some Fury wandering after her victim, were baffled at every step. Logan convulsively grasped the hand of Harold, articulated with a choking emphasis, some low words and Harold gently detached his arms, left him leaning against a tree, and went in search of the approaching sound. It constantly eluded him. He shouted. The shout was echoed. Nearer and more near it came. A furious cry—a delirious laugh succeeded! He was filled with an indefinable apprehension of some unearthly thing; and recoiled upon his steps—most fortunately too! for he came just in time to cut the sinews of an uplifted arm—uplifted to inflict a mortal wound upon the prostrate and dying Logan. The body fell with the tremendous visitation of Harold's tomahawk, and Logan smiled! It was the last time. Harold sat beside him. The giant's head he took upon his knees, and wiped the cold sweat from his forehead. `Let us begone,' said Harold. The dying man feebly shook his head, `no, no!' said he at last with a deep sob—`no! I am dying. Feel here! here!' he added as Harold attempted to comply. He shuddered—he withdrew his hand—It was covered with clotted blood, and the warm tide gushed after it. Logan moved and endeavoured to raise himself, and stand for a time unsupported. He lifted his head from the shoulder of Harold, stood erect for a single moment, gazed upon his pale countenance, put back the hair from his noble forehead, with an emotion that shook his whole frame like an earthquake—smiled proudly, and fell upon his bosom, as if he would cleave and grow to him forever, and sobbed aloud. Yes! yes, this implacable, this fierce and unsparing man, locked his arms about his preserver, and strained him to his bosom, again and again, while his heart quaked, and his sobs were audible. `I am beset,' said Logan, `on all sides, no place to turn to, no refuge, no friend, alone, alone, all, all alone, bleeding, dying. Lo, I am beset. My enemies are upon me. I am helpless, unarmed.' `Who are they?' `The three Mohawks.' `The three Mohawks!—stars of heaven, warriour! Logan, thou art right. The Mohawks are upon thee! The avenger of blood is commissioned!' `Boy—boy! know you what you say?—to whom you speak? Boy—I am murdered! `Know I what I say? Yes! To whom I speak? Yes! Would that I might not taunt thee, thou brave, thou most wretched man. But thou, thou art a murderer, and thou deservest to die like a murderer.' A deep groan was the only reply. Harold turned his eyes downward—(they had been upon the throne of heaven, glittering above his locked hands,) the head of the Indian was buried in his panther skin. He had covered his face and fainted. `Curse on my cruelty,' cried Harold. `At such a moment too! Logan! Logan! forgive me, I knew not what I said.' But Logan heard him not. The heaving of his chest; the convulsive breathing, and agitated movement of his whole body had given place to a hushed lifelessness. Harold threw himself by his side, lifted his head upon his lap, and besought him, wildly, again and again, to look up once more, and forgive him. A strange, dreadful interest took possession of his heart, and he, too, in his turn could have fallen upon the murderer and wept, in bitterness and humiliation. His efforts and agony prevailed. Logan opened his eyes, his lips moved—a long, long respiration followed, and he dwelt for a moment upon the face that almost touched his own, with a look of such majesty! such awful steadiness and reproach! that even Harold could not abide it—no, no! he could not. `You have called me a murderer—me—(a pause) Young man! Harold! beware!' `Nay, Logan, do not threaten me. Do not look so upon me. Thou canst not—thou couldst not intimidate me, even in thy strength. We meet as friends now; but a threat, a single threat, of look or lip, or gesture, or word—a single threat—and here as we are, with no help near—thou bleeding and dying at my feet, the cold sky above us, and solitude and dead men about —even here, here! will we join hands in battle. Here! will I, if thou art unable to stand and wrestle—here will I place a dagger in thy hand, and throw myself down by thy side, and take blow for blow from thee! A single threat, and I will do this. In thy strength thou wast stronger than I—mightier than I; but even then I did not fear thee. I shrank not, as thou knowest, before thee; but now, if thou art not yet appeased, I will waive all advantages—I, myself, will place my knife in thy hand—set thee upon thy feet, and throw myself upon thee, face to face, naked as thou art, and thou shalt search my heart, as I will thine—fight together, die together—I care not! But don't threaten me Logan, I will not be threatened.' `Boy, boy—thou art indeed of a magnanimous nature—not to be threatened, not intimidated by a—dying man! Harold bit his lip, and half rose from his recumbent posture. His hands were clenched. `Thou art mad, mad, Harold.' `Mad, mad!' shouted Harold, `Oh would that I were mad!' bounding upon his feet, and tossing his arms deliriously to the skies, `where is Loena!' `Hell and furies!' cried Logan, with a yell that rang far and near. `Boy! speak but that word again, that name, and I'll rend thee piece meal, drink thy hot blood, aye, every drop in thy veins—upon the spot—' As he uttered these words, he stood upon his feet, strong and terrible as ever, for a moment, and a weapon was suddenly brandished in the star light. Harold lifted his arm, but the weapon was dropped. Harold stood calmly before him. `Look you, Logan,' said he, `I am here. I am now more than your equal. Even now, you tremble; how could you sustain the grapple of death with me now? (Logan leaned against the rock.) Time was, when you were more than mine. I am now able to put a-sleep, forever, you and yours. Yes, Logan, I am able to slay thee on the spot. I feel this, I am sure of it, a blow would do it, one blow, and no mortal hand could help thee; and do I not owe thee that blow? Have I not a right to avenge myself, and my friends? I have. And yet I forbear. I cannot slay thee. I cannot lift my hand against thee. Why is this? Is there something sacred about thee? No. Aught that is indestructable? No. Thy blood and weakness show that. And yet, thou hast now, as ever, no equal, no antagonist. I dread to encounter thee. I, in my strength, thou, in thy helplessness. Nay more, I feel a growing kindness for thee. I know not why. Is it compassion? No. It is sterner and loftier. My terrour abates, I dare not pity thee, cannot love thee: But I feel my spirit bowed down with veneration and awe. Nay, do not avert thine eyes, I love to gaze upon them —there are strange yearnings in me, and I feel a sickness and longing that are unaccountable, while their look is VOL. I. K upon me. It is not loathing. No. Nor detestation, nor hate, nor abhorrence. No, no, it is a proud, great swelling of the heart, holier, and mightier than I have ever experienced before. But for this, Logan—nay, do not approach, I dread to touch thee—I should have slain thee at first. Why that groan? Come, if thou wilt, to my heart. I cannot refuse thee, red and terrible as thou art. Let us be friends. Shall we be friends? What sayest thou? Speak Logan, alive or dead—foes or friends? Logan was again overcome. He tottered towards Harold, covered his face with his hands, and fell at his feet, clasping his knees. `Oh my son! my son!' said he. Harold was stupified with amazement. A flash, like the lightning of heaven, blazed through his brain—the sweat rolled down his forehead and lips—all was explained all!—his birth! his awe!—He knelt down and embraced his father. `Thy son!' he articulated, as their cheeks touched, `thy son! Oh God! my father! my father.' For minutes they were locked to each other, soul and body. `Hear me,' said Logan, as soon as he could speak, `hear me, Harold. I am dying. The hand of death is upon me; my brain whirls. I was never mad but for a moment; but if I live now, I shall live a madman. Let me die; pray with me, my son, that I may rather die. What—sobbing! shame on thee, Harold. Hear me. There are but a few breathings more for me. I am murdered, murdered by Indians. I forgive them. Do thou forgive them. Nay, I insist upon it; give me thy promise. New feelings have taken possession of me. In a few moments I shall be at the bar of Him that made me. I do not despair; bloody, bloody as I am, I do not despair. He knows me; he hath created me; he knows my infirmities; but hush, I cannot talk on this subject; I command thee to forgive them. Nay, ask me not, I—thou shalt never know who I am, or what I am, till thou art good and great. Choose thou thy course. Avoid blood shed. Wilt thou forgive them? Speak, speak quickly, my son.' `I will, I do.' `Well then. Now swear that thou wilt pursue the whites to extermination, day and night, forever and ever—' `Father!' `I understand thee. This thou art commanded to do —appointed to do. In doing this, thou but fulfillest the command of the avenging God. It was he that commissioned me. Beware of murder; but give them battle in their churches, at their fire sides, funerals—' `I will, I will,' cried Harold, in a loud voice, firing and trembling, at the awful solemnity of his manner. `I will, so help me heaven, in my utmost need.' `Be thou the Indian leader,' continued Logan, his voice waxing fainter and fainter at every respiration. `Unite them; head them; perfect their confederacy. Drive the whites back to the banditti of Europe—back to—(his voice faltered) to—back to England! (His articulation was convulsive and passionate.) Rescue thy inheritance; avenge thy mother—Oh, God! Oh, God! where art thou, dearest! Lo, I am coming! I am coming— Yo me muero.' A long pause succeeded; Logan's lips moved as in prayer, and his eyes rolled over the whole circumference of heaven. `Harold, remember England. Thou hast great claims, great pretensions there. Go there. Learn all that white men know. Return and emancipate the Indians. Do this! and thy father's blessing shall be upon thee, through fire and water. Nay, his spirit shall be upon thee—that shudder! Harold, my son, do not execrate me. The malediction of my child, I cannot endure. I may deserve it, but I cannot, will not endure it. I am thy father, Harold— steeped to the throat, in blood and guilt; going, going, Oh God! to mine account—but curse me not, my child. It would avail thee nothing, and it would send me before the judgment seat, blaspheming all the world, and thee, and Him. I am not all guilty as I seem. Thou shalt one day learn what hath driven me hither, hated and abhorred; making me a bye word among men. Yes, thou shalt one day learn all. The means are open to thee. If appointed, I will be with thee, with thee, my child, forever and ever, sleeping and waking, in battle, and fire and smoke, upon the water, or in the wind— `in the hour of death and in the day of judgment.' Oh Harold, my son, my son, pray with me that this may be permitted to us. — — — — — — I am going, Harold. Thy hand, thy hand, my son. How cold and small it feels. It grows dark too. Nearer, Harold, nearer; there, lay thy hand upon my forehead. Tell me that thou forgivest and blessest me. Canst thou?' Harold pressed his lips upon the awful front of his father, and blessed him. `One moment, my son: raise my head, a little, a very little. Let me look upon the sky. It is midnight, is it not Harold? How beautiful the stars. What blue magnificence! What prodigality of power and loveliness! Can He, Harold, tell me, my child, there is comfort in the sound of thy voice, can He be unmindful of a dying man?—Ah! what is that? Look up, my son. Is there not a shadow descending? The sky too, does it not approach us? Ah, it grows colder and darker. That water! go my son, scoop some of it up in thy hand, and touch my temples. A moment longer, one moment, place thy hand upon my heart, Harold. There! keep it there, while I speak. These are my last words. Go to Loena. Nay, my son, keep it there. Tell her that her name was upon my lips, with my last breath. Aye, groan Harold, groan! weep, weep away! I have groaned—I!—and I have wept too. Tell her how, and when, and where I died. And tell her that thou art purchased for her in blood. Now, farewell! my son! my son. The hand of Logan is reaching to me. I see it! Welcome to the halls of the great. I come, Icome! Once more, farewell, farewell. Harold, Harold, everlasting hatred to the whites! War, waste and extermination to them!—fidelity—Oh! fidelity to thy brethren—Father!—father!—Loena!—Loe—' The spirit hath departed. How chilly it grows. Look there! Beneath our feet is Harold, lying upon his face, the blood stagnating about him, his hair blowing over the rock, and his extended hands motionless as death, beneath him, and encircling his neck, his own father, the terrible, the tremendous Logan. `Can it be—Oh merciful father! can it be! I, I his son! True, true, it must be so. I see it all. A stupification is upon me.' Harold disengaged the naked arms of his father, and arose, and seated himself upon a rock under the tree. There was an insupportable stillness about him. It was deep midnight—an awful, boundless transparency of shadow: a firmament as of dark chrystal, sprinkled with fire, above him; a moon shedding a faint and beautiful light on the verge of the horizon, like a lamp of pearl, fed by an inward flame. The religious and mysterious horrour of his feelings increased at every breath that he drew. The ferment of his blood had subsided. His emotions had died away. He locked his hands; he knelt; he wept. The great, the terrible Logan, him, the white man, whom he had so hated and feared so steadily—the body before him, that! that was his own father, But whence was he? who? These revolutions of thought grew intolerable, visions of distant empire, ambitious and tumultuous, came surging in upon his understanding, like an ocean thundering against the battlements of a continent: worlds rolled about him. His silence became that of death. He lifted his front to the heavens. They never were so beautiful. The stars were literally dropping in pale streams of light, and rippling upon the dark water at his feet. The whole dominions of heaven were bounded by piled up and broken ramparts of the blackest midnight; while, from horizon to horizon, sprang an arch of dazzling vapour, like a bridge, wavering and shining as if mid way between earth and immensity. Away beyond him flowed the river, in transparent blackness; and yet further, were measureless and undulating shores, darkly wooded: beneath him a sky, yet blacker and more brightly begemmed. A sound— K 2 Harold started and listened. Some wild beast was dashing through the distant wood, as if pursued. He shuddered. The chill of an unearthly presence was approaching him. He dared not raise his head. A long silence followed. He composed the limbs of his mighty father, threw himself once more upon the body, and while endeavouring to find the sheathe of his knife, discovered a small ivory tablet, glued with blood, within the bosom of his inner jacket. He took it, polluted as it was, and placed it next to his own heart. `I will return now,' said Harold. `Farewell, farewell, forever, thou mighty in heart! I go to thy enemy. He shall come and do the honours of sepulture for him whose countenance he trembled to look upon; for him, at the sound of whose tread, his knees smote together.' Onward he toiled, sadly and doubtfully, frequently disturbed by some crackling above him, as the young panthers, snuffing his approach, leaped along from tree to tree, and rock to rock: and starting ever and anon, as if some creature of the upward element were at his elbow. Harold was superstitious. His boyhood had been spent with the Indians, with the Logans particularly, to whom the preternatural visitations of their bold ancestry were common; so common indeed, that the stranger, nay the passing traveller, sometimes felt, in his proximity to the haunted places of the tribe, a shivering in his very bones, of which he knew not the cause, until he was told by the experienced, and made to participate in the unwilling and awful communications of them, that muttered and wrought there. Wo to him that trespassed at midnight, upon their council, as they assembled in seasons of calamity—all the living and dead generations of the Logan! Wo to him! for go where he would, in sunshine or in moonlight, in silence, darkness and solitude; or amid the thronged and clamorous habitations of men; go where he would, he would see shapes and faces passing before him, and hear voices above and below, in the air and the earth and the water; upon the mountain top, in the deepest midnight, with shut eyes, he would see gigantick shadows, gesticulating fiercely against the sky, and walking all over the tents and waters, and through the hunting grounds of Logan. Go where he would, a shadow would precede him; stalking onward from height to height, looking at him from the tangled thicket, with a dim and terrible face; or gazing upward from the depth of the water, over which his canoe was flying. Stranger, beware. Intrude not upon the dominions of Logan, if thou lovest sleep. Touch not their confines, if thou wouldst not be haunted forever and ever.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER VIII. `L'amour!.... Je ne saurais m'en passer. `I know not, I ask not, If guilt 's in thy heart; I but know that I love thee Whatever thou art!' Moore. `The heart is like the sky—a part of heaven; And changes—night and day too, like the sky: Now, o'er it, clouds and thunder must be driven, And darkness and destruction, as on high. Byron. God of heaven! Father! Lo, thy visitations are upon the creatures of thy hand. The being of thine appointment, he whom thou hast fashioned for great deeds; he, who had slumbered away his youth, his whole youth, unknowing either his power, their magnitude or variety, he!—now starts out from the troubled darkness of night, with ten thousand heroick aspirations battling within his heart. `Where am I?' cries Harold, the young Logan of the wilderness. `Oh, God of the great sky! to what hast thou commissioned me? Lo, I am here! ready to do thy bidding. I bow myself down before thee, wondering at the tremendous revolution of the past night. I tremble at the contemplation of mine own change. Thou hast revealed the ocean of immeasurable thought to me. I cannot meditate; I dare not. Do Thou sustain me. Do Thou administer to my spirit. I cannot approach thee. I cannot understand mine own nature. Do Thou exhibit it. What spirit is this, beseting me so vehemently? Be it evil or good, I am yielding to it. Father! I have been taught to approach thee in the dark wilderness; in the immeasurable, stern, oppressive solitude, with the broken and dislocated foundations of a world heaped up about me, like entrenchments, up, up to the very sky. I have been taught that Thou art great and terrible. My spirit has lain prostrate and gasping on the earth, before the tremendous denunciations of thy power. I have quaked to my innermost soul; dust and sweat have covered me from head to foot, as I have pursued thee through the eternal silence of thy habitation. Yet, Oh God! that thou art not to be feared, not dreaded; but that thou art a God of benevolence, and as the christians say, of long suffering, I have forever believed, even in the agony of my supplication. Father! Father! Thou who art alike, the father of the red man and the white. Thou who hast given the inheritance of the Indian to fire and sword. Thou who hast permitted the innumerable nations, and kindreds and tongues of this, the new world, to be scourged, and thinned, and scattered, and swept from the earth, by pestilence, and famine, and white men. Oh, do Thou teach me to direct the fierce passion that agitates me. Do thou, Great Spirit, unfold to me the meaning of these mysterious and terrible anticipations. Why am I thus shaken? Why this throbbing of my temples? Whence all these feelings—so vast, so boundless, so new! What is my destiny? What, Oh our God! What the destiny of the Red men? Am I to restore their—I— Is their dominion to return?—youchsafe—' Harold leaped upon his feet. The thunder rolled about the heavens, with a suddenness and loudness that made the hair rise upon his head. All the mountains thundered in reply. The foundations of the very earth appeared loosened; and Harold stood blinded, shivering, and bowing as if he had seen some palace or pyramid, tumbled headlong, in the concussion of the air; and the fire and smoke of an angry god rolling and flaming amid the dust of its ruins—even while he was gazing upon it. Harold shouted as the reverberations died away. He shouted, with the shout of a warrior to embattled legions, when the first banner of the enemy is shattered in the blast of his onset. He stood, in the hurricane of his spirit, and brandished his arms, and shouted, again and again. A sublime and incomprehensible feeling took instant possession of him. He regarded the sudden roll of the thunder, and the sheet of blue flame that rushed by him, as a manifestation from heaven, that his prayer was heard, and that he was appointed to rebuild the habitation of the Indian. The night had been a night of many wonders. He had found his father—found him, after struggling so long with the doubtful and mysterious associations of his memory, in the hope of finding some one who would love him, pray for him, weep for him, die for him: some one, before whom he could fall down upon his knees, as he would before his Maker, and cry father! I am thy son, thine own, thine only son. Do with me, as it shall seem to thee best. And now that he had found him, what was he? Who was he? Was he not stained, horribly stained, with the thick pollution of his nature? `And yet,' whispered Harold, while an instinctive shudder of admiration thrilled through and through him, `and yet, he was great, in his awful vindictiveness; his immoveable steadiness; his unapproachable, unassailable seclusion of spirit; impervious, indiscrutable; compounded of the fiercest elements, impelled and agitated by the most unearthly ambition. But who was he? A white—`Why knew I not, Oh my father, that thou wast of mine enemies, before we met? Thou shouldst have wrought my conversion, or I thine. Why didst thou forsake me? Why leave me so young? Why make me swear, as thou didst, to pursue forever and ever the men who have since fallen, one by one, successively, in obedience to my vow? Why meet me too, as thou didst, thrice, thrice, in the battle, and stand, in thy gigantick self possession, as courting death, and provoking it, from a parricide? Forgive me, Oh forgive me! my hands were well nigh red with the blood of thy great heart! well nigh, wounded and desolate as I found thee, well nigh was the hand of thy child to the red fountain of his being, ready to break and rend and scatter!—Ha, governour—' The governour slowly advanced. He grasped the boy's hands, and stood gazing upon him, with his heart too full to utter a single word. He tried to speak, but he could not. He could only press the young Indian to his heart, and weep upon his shoulder. He recovered himself, and then, as if never weary of studying his countenance, repeatedly thrust him off, then drew him back and passed a trembling hand over his intrepid forehead. He was struck with amazement! Whence that newborn sublimity of aspect? The old man's lip quivered, and his delighted face shone with emotion. The eagle-eyed Harold shrunk not, quailed not, moved not, from the inquisitive and searching look of the old man. They went together to the apartment of the governour. Harold told all, every thing; the death of Logan, the Indians, the discovery of his birth. The governour's countenance fell. It became troubled. He renewed his examination of the lofty and ample forehead before him, but with no satisfactory result. `Has he told all?' thought the governour: He had, but it was long before the governour was entirely satisfied that he had. The funeral ceremonies were in preparation immediately. There was an uncommon earnestness, and solemnity, and attention to pomp and magnificence in the arrangements, that had never been seen before upon the continent. All the troops were under arms. Military honours were decreed. All was ready, and the scouting parties, that had been detached, to scour the woods and bring the bodies, were every moment expected. They returned. But they brought with them only two bodies—where was the third? The third! The pressure of the turf beneath the tree, where Harold had just left the body of Logan, was yet visible; nay, almost warm, and the life blood had settled thickly in its centre, but so recently, that it had scarcely coagulated, or blackened in the sun and wind. Near—too near for such mortal foes, even in death, still lay the slain warrior, his hand reached out convulsively—his fingers wide apart, and stiffened, and bent, as if every sinew had cracked, and every blood vessel burst, in the last mortal reaching of his soul, in his delirious agony, for aid. But where was Logan? No track was in the dew— none in the frost; none upon the leaves. The dry moss and the withered herbage told no tale. His spirit had departed from him; and hours, whole hours had passed, while young Harold had set, beleaguered by dead men, under the violent and dreadful oppression of thought growing cold again, like lava, after an eruption, and stagnating and glowing under a boundless and comfortless, dark and silent sky. But whither, and by what hath it been borne away?' was the inquiry of all. `To the river?' the thought was electricity. The river was dragged, forded, searched, from shore to shore. In vain. No trace was discovered. And yet, there was said to be, though Harold had no opportunity of examining for himself, there was said to be, an appearance, as if the prow of a canoe had run ashore near the spot—and, at an incredible distance, the print of joined feet, and the proportions of a body, as if some one, of preternatural strength, had leaped, and fallen. But whence the boat? and who the boat-man? Harold's blood ran cold. There was a superstitious belief among the descendants of Logan, which made the stoutest of the family quake. It was their hereditary creed that they, who laughed to scorn the promptings of the good spirit, were sometimes caught upward even in the chase, or the battle, and never more seen upon the earth; and that others, many generations before, had fallen asleep, and been heard of no more; had been plucked out by hands that were visible, like shadows in the air, from the very centre of their armed brethren, while they were watching about them, as sentinels about their chiefs. Sometimes, it was said, that they would be talking together in the caverns of their dominion. They would be looking in each others faces. Their dark countenances would be lowering intensely between their fixed, supporting hands. They would hear no sound, see nothing, feel nothing—but one of their number would be gone! their chief!—they would know not how, and know not when! Was this another of these visitations? Were the adopted children of this family alike the objects of solicitude and vengeance, to the guardian spirit of the Logans? Who may answer such questions? Enough for Harold that Logan was not found. He was troubled. A fixed and cold disquietude took possession of his heart from that moment; a vital terrour, thrilling him with superstition. He had lost his father, and such a father!—so terribly; almost by his own hand. He had beheld him weltering, gasping, suffocating, in his own bood, at his feet; had seen him die, heard his last blessing, felt his last breath, and left him, why? wherefore? to the visitations of some unearthly thing, who had, perhaps, in the wantonness of her unknown power, stung him, the dead man, again to life, but to riot again over the horrible agonies of his dissolution. A heavy roll of drums roused Harold from his meditations. A quick discharge of musquetry drew him to the windows of the apartment. Trumpets rang, and the melancholy cry of a blown bugle died away in the wind, with a mournful, desolate voice. The troops were collected in the great square. The populace, with horrour and consternation in their faces, were gathered around and breathless; cleaving to each other. The two bodies were exposed, just as they were found, gashed, disfigured, stiff and stark, side by side. Many Indians were around, lowering dimly upon the scene, and demanding, by their deep and impervious silence, a quick explanation of its meaning. There was none to answer. The governour soon appeared. He was in full uniform, and sat his horse like a king. All the military parade, that the colony could furnish, was before the eyes. The shattered ensigns were unfurled. One solitary piece of light artillery was harnessed and disposed in the centre, and a troop of disorderly cavalry were pivoting and wheeling, and rearing incessantly. The Indians were huddled together; but there was that in their looks, which, even at the distance that Harold was, served, to his experienced eye, to demand explanation. He continued to watch them. Their sullenness was boding. The governour was proceeding to explain these appearances to them, when it occurred to him, that by burying the two slain Indians with some appearance of parade, he would do more towards conciliating them, than by any explanation whatever. Orders were instantly given for a detachment to file off, and prepare for the ceremonies of sepulture. The trumpet was blown. And poor Harold, who could endure the preparation no longer, galloped in among them on horseback. His eyes flashed fire. His lips were ashy and quivering; his voice was hoarse with suffocation and wrath. The flanks of his young horse were streaming with blood, and the rowels were driven in, again and again, ere he could bring the furious animal sufficiently near to be heard. There was a rising shout —`Silence,' he cried, `silence.' His sword lightened in their eyes. The governour was astonished. The Indians gathered about him. `Silence,' cried Harold again. All was silent as death. `Governour, do you bury murderers, murderers! with the honours of war! The governour coloured. An Indian was seen to advance his foot, and bring his short rifle half way up to his shoulder. Instantly a whole platoon levelled at his heart. The cavalry prepared to charge. The horses were wheeled aside from the piece of artillery, and the match was swung over the vent, and ready to be applied at the slightest signal. Harold saw it all. He observed another Indian, who had been the nearest to him, and the foremost all the VOL. I. L while, withdraw, and stand aloof, with an aspect of command. Others did the like at a distance, and their eyes were upon him. Was he to be the first victim? Harold looked to the priming of his pistols: secured his sword knot to his wrist; thrust his feet home in his stirrups, reined up his horse, and prepared himself for the worst. All eyes were upon him. A war whoop!—Behold him now! dashing like a thunderbolt from right to left! He waves his hand See! A bugle rings out his charge; and the troop of horse, in a whirlwind of dust, are at his heels. His voice rises above the cry of a multitude. His horse is seen every where. His voice is heard every where. The onset is in smoke and flame. The Indians throw themselves upon him, man after man, as by a preconcerted arrangement. He is wounded—his horse falls—he is upon his knee!—entangled in his harness. Hark! his pistols ring—he is partially liberated—staggering, and many are upon him. God be praised! a bright apparition moves through the thick of the fight to his rescue! unarmed and half naked, it comes! Can it be! Can his eyes deceive him! His arms are outstretched—he is helpless—his sword drops from his hand. A blindness follows—`Harold, Harold!' it cries. He recovers. Now, now, for vengeance. He thunders and lightens in his wrath. Can he be deceived. Can mortal force keep down his mounting spirit, at such a moment. No, no, all the Indians in hell could not hold him to the earth, though the breath had left his body, and they were heaped upon him by tribes. He breaks from them; he rends himself away! They fall to the right and left; his blows rain upon them with flashes, like the northern light. Quicker than the thought of man could believe it possible, Harold hath cut his way through his foes—alone, alone. Rifle after rifle ringing after him—onward he bounds, amid the renewed whooping and yelling of the foe, who are recovering from the panick that seized them at the first sight of the lovely vision that broke upon the cloud of battle. They gather, and thicken, and crowd and wrestle, with a more diabolical obstinacy than ever, about him. The governour is down and wounded. His gray hair is in the dust. His lovely wife—her dishevelled tresses flying in the wind; her bosom naked; her garments of lilied whiteness, rent and stained with blood —is rushing towards him. A contest, as of devils, is raging about her steps. Harold is leaping forwards, she sees him, she extends her arms, she utters a thrilling cry; the cavalry hear it, they wheel, and down they come, thundering, to the rescue. The infantry rally again. They form—peal after peal is ringing from their heavy muskets. Harold fights on, covered with wounds, the blood falling from him like rain. He marshalls his chosen ones about the precious spot—a circle of foot and horse, of fire and smoke, now encompass the old man and the woman of beauty. They are untouched, unprofaned now, by even the look of an enemy. He is on foot. A horse springs by him, his bridle loose, and his stirrups swinging as he goes. His last rider hath fallen, mortally wounded, in the charge. Harold leaps into the saddle; bare headed, and red with the tribute of battle. He flies, shouting and waving his sword, again to his cavalry, while the deadly fire of the Indian rifles is raining in upon them, from every stump and tree; and every shot tells. `Charge, charge,' cries Harold. It is done. Each man singles out his enemy, and gallops over him. They wheel in a stream of fire, and many a scalp is whirling and scaling to the earth, and many a head is rolling upon the ground. They charge and press, and hew the red men down, limb from limb, with their rifles at their cheeks. Thus hemmed in by the mounted swordsmen, and running hither and thither, yelling and battling as long as they can stand, or sit, or lie, the Indians are literally cut to pieces, in the presence of women and children. Hear them! they are shrieking and wringing their hands at the windows, and on the house tops, that overlook the square! What an impulse for brothers and husbands and fathers! Still the affair is not determined. The Indians fight with their accustomed desperation; giving no quarter, taking none; renewing again and again, their onset upon Harold. He is still upon the field, racing from one end to the other, panting and worn out with the hunt. At this moment he stops— gives a sudden order —points with his sword to a spot, where the enemy are rallying again. All appear eager to charge anew. He refuses—what means he? Would he be so rash, with that little band to gallop upon them? He will! he does. Shield him heaven! He places himself at their head— God of mercy!—he blazes upon them in a tempest of fire and smoke! He dashes through and through them: they are reeling and tumbling about as from a clap of thunder. Behold! there are many more heads rolling upon the ground; and many a trunk is giving out its blood, like a rattling fountain. The fight is over. The Indians are flying. The whites withdraw, and form upon the high space in the rear of the governour, and overlook the field. A few straggling horsemen are scouring hither and thither; an occasional shot, a wounded steed breaking from the forest, and now and then a shriek, coming from the woods, with a preternatural distinctness, show that the enemy is hotly pressed in his flight. A moment before, at the onset, Harold had cursed himself for his precipitation, in applying the spark as he did, to the conspiracy; but now, he was glad that he had done so, while the troops were under arms. The council assembled; the dead Indians were stripped, and the quantity of ball, and powder, concealed about them, together with the state of their arms, furnished conclusive proof of their preparation, for a deliberate and formidable assault. From this moment, Harold became a universal favourite. All eyes and all hearts were upon him. Till then, the whites had generally regarded him with jealousy and distrust. His swarthy Indian aspect; his haughty calm manner; they had made no friends, many enemies. For other reasons, he had been regarded by the Indians with a lowering and inquisitive eye. He was an Indian. That they knew. Then why herded he there? An Indian sleeping out of his lair, holding council and communion with the white man. Shame on him. Was he an apostate, a traitor, a renegade, leagued against his red brethren? Better, said they, for then they could have forgiven him; better that he were leagued with red men against red men. Now, now, he was indeed their foe. After this bloody affair, the whites appeared wholly to forget that he had one drop of Indian blood in his veins. The very women and children shouted and echoed his name as the watchword of safety. All that they had hitherto doubted and hated him for, his loftiness, melancholy sternness, all these things were now looked upon as the magnificent indications of greatness —preternatural greatness. He was their chosen one— their saviour. Their old governour, himself, was forgotten. `Saul had slain his thousands, but David his ten thousands:' and the very soldiers who had formerly writhed under the lightning of Harold's rebuke, were now bearing their voiciferous tribute to his bed side. He was wounded, gashed and pierced from head to foot. Where should he go? There was no question that he was entitled to the kindness of all—that his bed of dry leaves and fur, with the wind blowing about him, was no place for such a creature, at such a time—that he was the preserver of all and each—and therefore, all and each insisted upon the exclusive right of washing his wounds, and healing his broken spirit. But who had the best right? Ask the governour. His life had been saved again, again by the same dear hand. Yea, the life of her whom he loved, with a love passing the love of women —with all the doating, distracting, desolate fondness of parent, lover, friend, husband, all in one! She was the creature of his idolatry: a being, whose element was prayer and tears and tenderness. She too had stood over him, wounded, bleeding and naked to the gaze of ruffian violence, and the rude hands of men smoking with gore—and yet, she was saved! How could he be thankful enough for her safety! He knelt and she knelt. They knelt and wept together—wounded and torn as they were. Nor was Harold forgotten—a chamber L 2 and attendants were allotted to him. All that tenderness and veneration could do, was done for him. The holy enthusiasm of his character, fiery and desperate as it was, had become contagious. The very servants felt it, and they blessed him, fervently and repeatedly; and woke and prayed for him, and wept for him, in the silence of midnight. They would creep softly, one by one, to the door of his apartment, and listen there for hours, to discover if any sound betrayed his suffering; and sure was every one, go when he would, by night or by day, that he would meet some companion there, upon the same errand. Their duties were forgotten, (and who could reproach them? Not even their mistress)—in their visits of love and watchfulness. The truth is, that there was, in the mysterious history, and yet more mysterious adventures and deportment of Harold, a something like fascination, that spell-bound the interest and affections of all that came within the glance of his eye, or the sound of his voice: and, young as he was, the very aged themselves would stop, and lean upon their canes, and gaze upon him, affectionately and mournfully, as he walked by them, in the intense abstraction of his thought, with the step and tread of early manhood, yet buoyant and elastick with youth—firm and confident, as with the composure of assured superiority. Not a gesture, not a glance, not a tone, not a movement, but was instinct with peculiarity, unaffected peculiarity. The delirium of the governour returned. His wife, poor creature, was unable to attend him, and Harold, alas for him! he was powerless in aid or council—he was unable to pursue the rapid and wide developments of his own character. He gazed upon the adventures of the week with terrour and delight. A thousand fearful and brilliant evolutions passed before him. He trembled and was afraid at times, and at times an unspeakable thrilling, a kind of delirium ran through his arteries, and his heart danced in his bosom, amid the strange and indefinable feelings that had sprung up— at once—at once! in the compass of a single night, within the solitudes of his thought. This would pass away—a sense of desolation, enclosing him round about with a cold, dark atmosphere, and shutting out all communication with aught that was sunshiny or beautiful, would follow; and he would throw himself upon his bed, confounded and dismayed. Toward the evening of the fourth day, he sat at the window of his chamber, supported by pillows, quite faint and exhausted, with the bewildering action of his own mind, which quickened its activity, exactly in proportion to the torpor and quiet of his body. But is this peculiar to him? Can intellectual and physical exertion operate intensely at the same moment, in the same person? Can he who is wearied by metaphysical speculation, intoxicated with the liquor of heaven, which is poured out in golden cups to the inspired, can he hunt or swim, or leap with his accustomed spirit? Or can he who has just left the field of athletick competition, go to his books, with a mind sufficiently tranquil for successful inquiry? Enough then, this was no peculiarity in Harold's constitution. Well then, he was at the window. His eyes rested upon the crimson and flame coloured sky. A strange melancholy, mingled with an unaccountably pleasant thinking of death, had given way to a new belief. His was to be a name among the men of this earth. An impatient, hurried throbbing of the arteries—a scorching heat in the temples followed. He was weary of inaction. The sky was before him—supremely beautiful. Before him, reddening to its extremest verge, went the blue river, rippling in the light of the setting sun. The south western horizon was one waving and transparent undulation, as of heavy, illuminated drapery, like great curtains borne upward by the wind, and floating above the air of high places, or hovering over waters in commotion. A pile of profusely garnished and magnificent clouds of every shining colour and hue —rough gold—tremulous crimson, purple and violet and deep blue, with a luminous vapour of insufferable whiteness, evolving from its summit, like the smoke of a furnace, arose behind. From every side, there went fitful and incessant irradiations, streaming and flashing with all the colours of the rainbow, as if some beleagured garrison were showering forth their coloured darts, and flaming spears, from every cranny and crevice of their beautiful citadel. It was perpetually changing in hue and shape, and the whole circumference of heaven was agitated and trembling, like leaf gold in the wind. The mind of Harold caught the reflection, and was heated to intensity. Anon, there shot away up the meridian, quick, vivid, and subtle flashes of light; and then there followed a moving effulgence athwart the deep blue, like irradiations of discoloured armour issuing from file after file of glittering shapes, dashing hastily and incessantly through the profound of heaven. He raised his eyes. In the very centre of the firmament there was a gathering of the blackest clouds—congregated heap over heap. About its extremest verge, an unwearied and perpetual lightning; and from the centre, the very centre and key stone of heaven, there rolled a distant uninterrupted sound, as of continual battle. There was no cessation—none. The thundering and lightning were incessant, and very beautiful. Harold was inconceivably affected. And yet, such spectacles were common enough to his experience. Time and again, had he seen the sky, all changeable with the shifting hues of an arched and glittering furnace, encompassed by chrystalizations and spar of every beautiful colour—their lustres shedding all over the earth and water their innumerable and indistinguishable tinting. Many a time too, had he seen a cloud in a serene sky, settled, immoveable; its edges crimsoned and fiery like the bloody curtains of a brazen chariot; from its very centre, as of innumerable rockets—the quick meteors whistling and darting ceaselessly, in every direction, like the spokes of a wheel, to the extremities—and often, often too, had he heard the same uninterrupted reverberations; but never before had he been so immeasurably affected by their beauty and terrour. And why? Because never before had his thought moved in so capacious and sublime an elevation; never before, had he walked so fearlessly over the dominions of his God: never before, had the towering energies of his nature been so all awake, while the ferocious passions were so slumbering—and, never, never! had he felt such a melancholy and awful solitude of the spirit. It was as if he had suddenly been enthroned, and sceptred, within the illimitable dominions of space, and there, left alone in his sovereignty. He was in a trance of astonishment and delight. He was awakened from it by a sudden brightness, that blazed athwart the ceiling and walls of his apartment. He started—arose, as well as he could, and endeavoured to assure himself that what he saw was no illusion. The blaze grew brighter. His heart stopped. The superstition of his nature usurped her terrifick influence anew over his senses. He scarcely dared to lift his eyes. He felt as if the sky itself were descending, and the elements dissolving. He heard the shout of a multitude. He lifted up his eyes and beheld, afar off, a throng of women and children, or the appearance thereof, bearing faggots, and trailing branches of trees; and piling them up on the top of a high hill that over-topped the water; and ever and anon, he could see the gleaming of some weapon, flourished or unsheathed in the fire light, among the crowd. He gazed upon the spectacle quietly, and wondering at the cause, and still doubting if it were not a creation of his fancy. In a few moments, while the sky grew darker, and the objects at a distance, water and wood and hill, were all melting away into massive, shapeless, indistinctness, he saw a small body of men, strangely habited, and walking heavily along, with the attitude and expression of them that carry a burden. A second body followed with the same appearances! What could this mean? Harold leaned backward and covered his face with his hands. His hair rose. His flesh crept. In the early history of his family, just such a scene had taken place, with one of the earliest Logans. The summer before his death—at midnight—upon the extremest elevation of a rocky precipice, inaccessible to mortal footstep— men, as in procession, had been seen, passing and repassing, before a great red fire, with a body between them, all busily engaged as if preparing for a funeral sacrifice. After a while, they had disappeared. So had these. God of heaven— At this instant, a broad fire flashed and rolled upward to the very sky, bearing with it, like a hurricane, cinders and smoke and sparks innumerable! A dark and gigantick shape could be seen, apparently in the very centre of the flame, moving his long arms, and flowing drapery, continually about, with great wildness and solemnity, while a multitude of smaller figures, like women and men, were shouting and dancing round about the fire. `The same! the very same,' whispered Harold, shudderingly to himself. `But not for me! Be these terrible apparitions for the weak and humble. I scorn them. Oh, let me live, Thou, the unknown God, let me live yet a little while, till I have done something, no matter what, worthy of my life, and worthy of thee! Something that may be remembered, and then, Oh, I care not how soon after, I am gathered to my fathers. Just so,' he continued, `was that other sacrifice of perdition accomplished. The flames rose—spread—swept into the heavens; and there went up, in the midst thereof, a black shadow, with great wings outspread, toiling heavily upward, as against the pressure of some invisible hand that held him down, in spite of his resistance— but it mounted—and mounted, notwithstanding, till the flames were extinguished.' Harold bowed his head upon the pillow, and actually wept with the unaccountable melancholy that oppressed him. The shout was renewed. The flame rolled upward again with the noise of a great wind. It flashed, trembled, intermitted suddenly, and then revived. A few pale stars looked quietly through the white vapour that rolled thinly and widely upon the wind. The sky had become a jetty black. And beneath the evolving smoke, a multitude came trooping downward—could it be possible—toward the window where Harold sat in his helplessness. `They do not touch the earth,' said Harold, as he shut his eyes, and closed his ears in terrour. Voices were heard. `Surely—surely—it cannot be.' Harold listened, `where am I? Oh, where am I?' cried he, clasping his brain. `That voice!' he arose—trembled—grew heart-sick with pleasure. It came from a neighbouring window—there was no mistaking the voice—and Harold felt, as his hands dropped lifelessly over the arms of his chair, that he was near to her, the sound of whose lips so affected him. It was some gentle creature rebuking—in tones like the melody that, flowing nightly from the moon, fetters the disorderly tides, and spell-binds the tumultuous waters in their descent—the riotous merriment of the approaching multitude. He blushes. His eye kindles. His form shakes with self indignation. His blood, suspended and chilled by the superstitious and strange terrours that have just left him, now rushes with distressing velocity through every channel and artery, all at once, from his heart to his brain—from his brain to his heart. The veins swell upon his forehead—his wounds open anew—he gasps for breath—the blood flows—and he faints, faints with the excess of his self reproach. When he came to his senses, he found a fair creature stooping reluctantly over him—bloody too—her tresses bloody—her drapery torn—a mist was over his eyes, and he lay, holding his breath, and fearing to move, lest the beautiful apparition should depart. At last, he could support the delicious swimming of his heart no longer, he sighed, drew his palms faintly over his eyes, and caught a soft hand, almost unconsciously, to his lips and eyelids. The tears gushed forth at the touch. He drew her to his heart—but she struggled—repulsed him, with a tremulous dignity—a kind of haughty tenderness—reeled and sank upon the bed. His arm was over her waist, and their cheeks touched—and thrilled. She was faint—very faint, and tried again and again to speak. It was all in vain. She could only turn her blue eyes upon him (as he leant upon his elbow, and held her pale hand to his heart) dissolving in mournfulness and reproach. Oh, what were his sensations! Guilt had no place among them. He would have shuddered and recoiled at the touch of impurity. He would have died—died upon her bosom, without one feeling, but of love, love the holiest and tenderest. He knew not—she knew not, the peril that beset them. `Lady,' he whispered, `Lady! in mercy speak to me. Where am I? Who art thou? Can I be near thee—thee —in thy loveliness! Oh, speak to me.' Her lips moved, and a name, the name of Oswald, or Oscar, was faintly articulated. She gradually recovered. Her lip trembled—she arose—her forehead was damp; and she shivered all over, as she put away the fond arm that encircled her. A full sense of her situation flashed upon her. `Gracious God,' she cried—her lip curled, and her neck and bosom turned of the deepest crimson, as she buried her face in the curtain. Voices were heard approaching. The door opened. The lady Elvira there! She, the wounded lady, by the couch of the young Indian boy! Her husband heard of it. He asked no questions; he dared not ask any. To speak of such a matter, he thought would be to give it importance; besides, although he had the fullest experience of his wife's discretion, now, for the first time, there was a strange uneasiness in his heart, when he reflected on this circumstance—not that he doubted her—no! His heart would have burst, if he had. But—why was she there? Why, without apprising him? `I will tell him,' said the innocent creature, as she thought of the good old man, `I will tell him immediately, as I have always told him, every thought of my heart, just as it happened.' This she determined, and re-determined to do, sure that he would only smile upon her and kiss her forehead, and play with her hair. But the more she thought of it, the more difficult it appeared to do. Was it necessary? Did not her own conscience acquit her? Then why trouble him with it? Thus was she allured, in the first approach of a guilty passion, to omit the ceremonies of love and allegiance, under the pretence of their having grown useless. Woman, beware! This is the first stratagem of thy enemy. When thou hast done that which thou fearest to acknowledge in thy prayers—and forbearest to communicate to him, who dearly loves thee, thou hast consummated thy first failure of duty. Nevertheless, the lady Elvira did, as she had resolved; but she had so long meditated on the manner and the words of the communication, that her manner and words were unnatural and constrained, and her affected carelessness was particularly visible, as she endeavoured to relate the incident in her most natural manner. She had lost her own peculiar air of free, innocent unconcern—and she was but too conscious of it. She coloured as she told her tale, and then, angry with herself for betraying such unseasonable emotion, she coloured still deeper, down to her very finger ends. She made a desperate attempt to account for it, by an allusion to the heat of the room. The remark was particularly unlucky, and her trepidation increased. It was autumn —there was no fire—the window was open, and the evening air blowing directly upon her pale forehead. The governour took her hand; but she felt that it was taken, not in his usual manner; not with the same cordial, eager and delighted movement, as if there was a pulse in every joint—no, but with an expression of habitual civility, as one takes the accustomed privilege, lest, if he do not take it, it may be thought unkind— no pressure, no fervent clasping followed—no intertwining of the fingers—no touching of the pulses—nothing of that strange, dreaming sensation, which appears half spiritual, as the tips of the fingers pursue their delicate, trembling acquaintance and inquiry along the blue veins of some dear one's hand, when man is near, very near to what he most loves on earth. It would not do. The interview became painful and embarrassing. A thousand mournful and sweet recollections came hurriedly athwart the mind of the husband; and a thousand vague, haunting, terrible yet faint apprehensions followed. A slight convulsion passed VOL. I. M over his great forehead; and his lids swelled with tears—but none fell. Lady Elvira saw it all—knew the cause of all—and was inconceivably affected. But she felt her own innocence—felt the necessity of justification—and, for her soul, she could neither look nor speak as she was wont. What then was she to do? She affected insensibility. There was only one way, she believed, to conceal her hesitating timidity—and the strange embarrassment, which had so soon succeeded to her natural, frank, intrepid manner. And did she not conceal these, would she not give ground to worse suspicions? Could he believe that she was so agitated, so altered, by the trifle which had really occurred? Thus reasoned she—true woman—parleying with her own heart, at the moment of death, and concealing her thought, even from her God, to the extent of her power. At first she had been reserved and silent, because she could not trust herself to speak; as gentle and obedient spirits, are submissive under unkindness, lest, if they open their lips, their tears will follow. Who has not seen the time when he could not speak without sobbing? Who has not laughed to avoid crying? Who has not smiled, and talked wildly and incoherently, while his very heart was breaking, merely to avoid the impertinent sympathy of fools? Thus had she begun. But she ended with being haughty and hypocritical— nay, what she most scorned—deceitful. Oh, how mistaken was her pride! Had she fallen upon the bosom of her husband, and told him all, all! even to the most unfaithful of her thoughts, he had loved her but the better for it. He might have wept over her—but he must have forgiven her. Nay, there were circumstances, in her early history, of a nature to render her tenderness to poor Harold, less extraordinary to him, than it was to herself. But these circumstances were a mystery to all but him. For his soul, he would not have communicated them to her—her—who was the partner of every other secret of his life. She continued her explanation nevertheless. `She had been sitting at her window: the bodies of the two slain Indians had been burnt, in a paroxysm of rage, by the women and children, upon a neighbouring hill, out of especial kindness to Harold: they were returning— she feared their cries would disturb her—husband!— and—and therefore had she spoken to them. Just then, she heard a low groan from a near apartment—and a heavy fall. She called and rang. There was no answer. It was in Harold's room. Poor Harold! Weak as she was, she ran thither. Did she not owe her life to him? Nay, more, did she not owe the life of—' her husband, she would have said—but the cold, doubting look of his face, fell like a rebuke upon her proud spirit. Just at that moment too—it was too bad—her heart was flowing out at his feet. She was just beginning to recover her natural manner, and speak exactly as she felt. Her blood froze. A silence followed. `I found Harold,' she continued, with a manner more stately than her husband had ever seen her wear when addressing him, `I found Harold, our preserver, lifeless, weltering in his blood. The bandages were off, and the thick fluid was throbbing out with every convulsion of his heart. I rang the bell. What could I do? I tore off a part of my own dress and staunched the wound and bound it up anew, before he opened his eyes.' This was true—the truth, but not the whole truth. Her heart smote her, as she ended. But it was too late; and every moment made it more impossible for her to tell what followed. She continued however—`The exertion was too much. I fainted.' She turned her full blue eyes upon his countenance. It was unaltered: no emotion disturbed its strange serenity. There was a wild, mournful absence in it, which distressed her, and yet, there was a something of insensibility too, which prevented her from avowing that distress. `I must leave you now,' she added, `I feel weak, very weak; a sense of melancholy, dullness, heaviness here, that I cannot account for.' Her voice trembled— her eyes filled. `I shall endeavour to sleep, my lord,' she continued, `and when we are both of us more composed, I shall then have time to learn if I have done wrong.' There was a thrilling emphasis in her words; and, at any other time, her husband must have put forth his hand and detained her—but now, there was a calm abstraction of spirit that prevented it—a long, long forgetfulness, as if his soul were retreading the scenery, long since forgotten, and lamented, of some far distant country. His brow contracted—something vindictive and stern passed, for a moment, over his features; but it was soon succeeded by the usual expression of benignity and wisdom, that were charactered there. Lady Elvira arose, as she concluded, and attempted to depart. Her husband—Oh, that was the death blow to him!—that!—she never forgave it. She was still duteous—still innocent—still she loved him. But that— that! sundered them forever! He never moved a finger to detain her. He suffered her to go—to go unheeded even after her reluctance, so to depart, was visible to him; and what was inconceivably more humiliating to her, even after he appeared to understand the motive of her lingering. Yes,—that was the death blow to her love. Her countenance instantly became irradiate with her spirit. It flashed from her eyes. Her whole form dilated. She leant for a single moment against the hangings as she arose, faltered for a single breath, like one about taking an eternal adieu of many tender and touching recollections—like one, yielding for the last time, to the weakness of her heart; bent her pale, dark, affectionate eyes, now glittering with light, and streaming with tears, upon the countenance of her husband, and left his apartment—forever!—She tottered to her own room, and unable longer to support the ungovernable tumult of her bosom, sank lifeless into the arms of her attendant. An interval of some hours elapsed, before she was sufficiently composed to give any directions for the future. She succeeded at length, however—her timidity had gone—that look of forlornness and gentleness, which she had hitherto worn in solitude; yea, even the pride and stateliness of her accustomed publick carriage had passed away. In their stead there arose an awful steadiness and tranquillity. It was very fearful—very, in one so young and beautiful. It boded ill, let it light where it would, the desperate calmness of so smooth a brow:—Oh no, it is no light matter to check, so suddenly, and turn to stone forever, the gushing sensiblity of so true a heart, so trembling and so pure. Woe to the man that sees a forehead, that has ten thousand times been agitated and flushed with his breathing, and lips that have been tremulous and dimpling, for hours, as his cheek lay near them, grow, all at once, motionless, solid, and pale! Woe, to him. There is no more hope for him. `Martha—Martha,' were the first words she spoke— `you are henceforth my only attendant. You will sleep in my chamber for the future. Let nobody enter my apartment. I shall be sick, very sick. I feel it here, here,' she added, with alarming energy, her beautiful bosom swelling, as if it would burst, beneath the convulsive pressure of her hand. `I may become delirious, and God only knows what I may say. I would not be overheard. May I depend upon thee, Martha?' Martha fell upon her knees and sobbed in her lap. `Go, Martha,' continued this extraordinary woman, `place some servant, that you can trust, in the next apartment, and take care that nobody passes near my door.' Her voice failed her. Her countenance grew dark and terrible, with the strife of her immortal spirit. A thousand high thoughts arose, and paused, for a moment, and then passed over her uplifted countenance. She was upon her knees, or pacing her apartment, with her hot temples locked in her hands, the live-long night. Did she pray? No—she could not pray. Did she weep—Oh no!—tears would have been a comfort indeed—too great a comfort, to one so helpless, and so desolate. She could not weep—she would have given the whole world but to shed a few, few tears, such as she had wept heretofore, in the fulness of her heart. But no—no!—her sorrow now, was of an untold character. Her forlornness was—nay, it is easier to tell M 2 what it was not—it was not like any forlornness that she had ever felt before—ever! although she had left, all, every living thing that loved her, or that she loved, more than once, in her brief pilgrimage. `Too late, Oh, too late!' she articulated, wildly, just as the cold day light was breaking in upon her, and falling, like a chilly illumination, upon her disordered bosom— `too late hath my destiny broken upon me. Oh why have I lived! Why not gone blindfolded to my grave!' —A long, dreary pause followed—her face flushed, and the fire streamed from her uplifted eyes—`No—never! never!—I will arise. I will manifest myself. I will not submit. I will not be the wronged and suppliant woman! Woe to him that expects it!'</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER IX. `Oh what is love made for, If 'tis not the same, Through joy and through torment? Through glory and shame?' Je te suivrai partout. Reader!—there are stories told, with elbow on the grass, according to one of your most delicious modern poets. Mine is no such story. Your hand should be upon the hilt of your dagger. Your heart should rattle against your ribs; you should breathe seldom and hard, while you listen to me. Are you a man? Your breathing will show it. Follow me. Are you a woman? Can you weep for the guilty and disconsolate?—the strongly tempted—the frail—the penitent, and broken hearted?—if you cannot, forbear, shut the book. It is not meant for you. There is profanation in thy touch. If thou hast no mercy—forbear—if thou hast no tears, forbear;—for thou canst. The moral is not for thee— not for the strong, nor the confident. I adjure thee!— go no further, unless thou canst pity her, who has learnt to parley with temptation: nay, I would almost say— unless thou thyself, hast been tempted, strongly tempted. Then!—then, mayest thou go on triumphantly. It will be a lesson to thee. It will teach thee, while thou hatest the crime, to pray for the criminal. Lay thy hand upon thy heart, woman. Hast thou been tempted? Canst thou forgive? If yea—proceed. `This will never do, never—never!' thought Harold, as he lay, with his chest heaving, in a delicious, troubled, but guilty reverie, after Elvira had departed. `There is intoxication, madness in the thought. How deeply, timidly she breathed! With what a passionate, strange tenderness, her eyes shone upon me! How faint and pale she looked, when she repulsed me! And then— how her beautiful mouth trembled; as her tears trickled down upon it, and she leant over me with her shut eyes. And then!—when her thin lids opened, and the blue lustre beneath, waned and dimmed with the langour of her heart—Oh God! what a rapidity of interchanging light and crimson in her dear face! Oh, how surpassing all that ever went by me before. What was it? Whither went it! that illuminated, pale countenance. Stay!—ha! that spectre—where am I?' He leaped upright in his bed—the apartment shook under him. `Harold, Harold!—awake thee!'—he continued, with his palms pressed to his sore and aching temples— `awake thee! where is thine honour?—thy gratitude?— thy destiny! who bids thy spirit to its prostration?— (he shivered in an agony of indignation.) `Thou!— canst thou—of the blood of Logan—nursed in heroick self-denial, thrilling with the blood of many generations, that were pure and strong,—heroes!—canst thou so bow thyself down? Harold, Harold! awake thee! Art thou again—again! at the feet of a woman. Oh, shame on thee! And what a woman? Not a lone and desolate one; not the friendless and weeping one—a stranger among strangers—not the brown beauty of the wilderness!—not the unblessed, and desolate, and wild. Oh no! But thou!—Oh, wake thee, Harold. The wife of thy benefactor—thy father!'—(the blood ran cold about his heart, at the thought, and his hot eye balls throbbed in their sockets)—`Forgive me!—Oh, Righteous and Blessed one, forgive me.' Poor Harold was half crazy with the tumult; and he awoke to a full sense of his situation, only to feel a more deadly sickness at the heart, a more faint and weary loathing and detestation, of all that had motion and life in it. Gladly would he have slept—and slept forever. But sleep was forbidden to him. Yea the very air—the blessed air, that blew over his damp forehead, seemed, for a while, purged of its vitality. There was no balsam, no coolness, no fragrance in it. It felt to poor Harold, as he lay, with the tears and sweat stealing under his long lashes, like the tepid breath of a sick child. No wonder that he suffered. His whole heart was undergoing a purification. He had been `dazzled and drunk with beauty,' and his God was visiting him now, for his intemperance. He had lusted after unlawful dominion, and the price was now to be paid in horrour, and consternation, and self abandonment. `I shall never be well again! never, if I stay here,' thought the boy; and young as he was, he determined to begin, forthwith, and in earnest, the work of reformation. The future was opening upon him, curtain, over curtain, and great shadows were stalking about, with the likeness of kingly crowns upon their heads, and their arms folded. There was a sublime obscurity before him, a peopled empire—full of dim movement, and vast preparation. He awoke—roused himself. The phenomena, portentous and awful as they were, heeded not his rebuke, nay, nor his entreaty. They held their places. The walls of his chamber seemed extended to an immeasurable distance. The very curtains of his bed seemed flowing down, fold over fold, shadow over shadow, from the heaven of heavens. The wind blew; and bright shapes rode upon it. A change followed. All was dark about him. He retained his consciousness. His own heart became visible to him, as he cast down his eyes. It was a bed of live coals! And a spirit of godlike presence was fanning them; upon her broad front were the characters of an unknown language, written in blood! seethed, and fiery! It was Ambition. She arose, and waved her arm; and lo! the shadow, and the darkness of the far off void, began moving into shape, and colour, and concentration. The heavy drapery rolled upward through the solid walls of his chamber, as if drawn by an invisible hand; and away to the right and to the left, a measureless activity of light and motion appeared, growing every moment more and more distinctly beautiful, till the heart ached with pleasure and sublimity. Anon, forests of green and waving trees, in all their pomp and magnificence, slowly emerged from the far off horizon—parted—with brighter spots of agitated green; here, and there, between them—faded and vanished. Anon, the blue waters appeared, and spread themselves, hither, and thither, as though the bowels of the great deep were giving forth again, their cold treasures to the moon—and behold! these waters were covered with painted spectres—great ships and sails. And then!—the air darkened—it thundered! the horizon lightened round about: and the noise of battle rang, suddenly, through all the boundless circumference of the sky. Lights passed over the water—fleets engaged; and the apparition of many ships, shattered and blazing, drifted by— Harold sprang from his bed—knelt down.—`Spirit of my father!' he cried, in his delirium, `God of the red men! Be thou, O! be thou with me! The lands that were our inheritance are returning to us. I saw them; I!— moving off upon the track of our retreating nations! Here! here! oh thou spirit of our worship! thou, who art hunted, even as thy children are hunted, from these, thine immeasurable solitudes—thine appointed places— here! do thou bless them!—for here doth Harold consecrate himself; and all that he hath, all his powers and faculties; all his passions and hopes, and fears to thee! Here, I—the—I—the—' The impulse was gone—he faultered, bowed his head, and an universal trembling seized him. His pillow was drenched with his tears. But whither should he fly? Where gain the maturity and experience, and means, necessary for his purpose? Did he return to the red men? where were all his high-spirited and sublime notions of government? how should he rescue his countrymen from the thraldom, not of strength, but of cunning? where should he look for that ennobling intercourse, which, should fit him for command and companionship with the captains of Europe? that discipline, which should make his name terrible, when generation after generation had passed away? where that high and polished chivalry of deportment which should sustain him, as an Indian Prince, in his future intercourse with the whites? No—no!—he must not, could not prepare himself for a life of perpetual trial and achievement, but by learning of the white man all that he could teach—in war, in policy, and in legislation. But how, if he went away, how should he retain that overwhelming influence over the Indians, so indispensible to his purpose? would they resign him? would they receive him again? would they not feel jealousy, distrust and apprehension? they would.' `But better, after all; ten thousand times better that they should feel, all the evil passions of their nature, agitated to phrenzy at his return, if he came qualified for their redemption, than that he should risk among them the wasting away of his faculties, ineffectually. Harold had often been told by the governour, that it was his intention to send him to Europe, to complete the already singularly excellent education, which he had obtained at an early period, from the officers of a French garrison, where he had been a captive in his boyhood, till he won all hearts, and despoiled all their treasuries of science. All that the military art could teach, theoretically, to one so young, had been taught him. He was an admirable draughtsman—a good engineer—a good soldier—a good horseman, and decidedly the best swordsman in the fort, at the time of his escape. He had read little, but what he had read was of the choicest matter. His study had been truly French—war and elegance—the chivalry of a young knight, and the accomplishments of a young bridegroom. He had a thorough knowledge of French, and having been for a time among the Spanish possessions, had learned to speak that masculine language, with tolerable readiness and purity. These things, however, were a secret, and he disdained either to exhibit or practice, or even to acknowledge them, after his return to the Indians; all, except the sword and saddle, he trampled on and derided. But in these, he became terribly conspicuous. In time, no man strode a young war horse like Harold, and no human being wielded such a sword. `He played his weapon like a tongue of flame.' Now, new feelings arose. He panted to consummate himself alike, in all the graces, as well as the terrours of a brave man. The hope of going to Europe, hitherto almost extinct in his bosom, or remembered only as a pleasant dream of his boyhood, now awoke, with prodigious energy again. Too easily forced into vehement action, the nature of Harold had acquired an intensity of expression that was unintelligible to ordinary minds. He fevered and burnt, when the thought was upon him. There was, even in his most hidden and mysterious movements, however, an air of reality, that convinced those who could not understand how it would be done, that whatever he determined upon, would be done. There was such a stern and lofty carriage in his eye, so much of that composure which bespeaks a spirit familiar with its own resources—accustomed only to success, that your heart would swell in your contemplation of him, and you would speak and predict as rashly, and as positively as he thought. His manner was preternatural— portentous. It was not graceful—no, nor welcome, in one so young—with a heart so filled and buoyant with the electricity of boyhood. He should not keep so firmly upon his feet— his shut mouth should not indicate so resolute, so unsparing a decision of character, at his age. I do not like it. It is, as if the untrained falcon should fly straight through the thinnest and bluest air, upward, upward, directly in the very face of the sun. It would be wonderful in the confirmed and disciplined, but it is rash and headstrong, in the inexperienced. But misfortunes, exposure, a rough world, neglect and keenness, had exasperated the stormiest elements of his nature into wrath and madness. In the boiling thereof, there had been forced up from the profoundest depths of his heart, many precious and detestable things; many unknown and unnatural thoughts, which, under a gentler sky, with a less windy and tempestuous visiting, had remained forever, undisturbed, unvisited, unthought of.—The pearls and the sea snakes; the red coral and the white skeleton, the treasures and the abominations came together to the surface! Young as he was, there was that settled and immoveable determination in all that he thought or did. And yet there was a time, when his volatility had been conspicuous. That passed away, and there succeeded, a perseverance, so unwearied, so indefatigable, so immortal, that they who prophesied in his childhood, forbore to prophesy, after a little while. He was like nothing that they had ever heard or read of. Nay, there was not an action, a word, an attitude, the most trivial, that did not reveal to the unprejudiced, (for they persisted long in calling his conduct affectation and insolence) to the man that knew men, how entirely prepared was the mind beneath, for all that could happen, in the nature of things—all!—whether of trial or promise, humiliation, sorrow, or death. He had no companions. He scorned the companionship of boys, and the men that beset him were little better than boys; and they repelled him for a while. He was said to be unsocial. He was not. But he could find no kindred nature; none that would regard; `the night-mare moaning of Ambition's breast,' as other than a childish disease. In time, this changed. Men looked and wondered. This boy, whom they had shut out as presumptuous and unamiable, from their houses and hearts, was now welcomed with outstretched arms, as the kindest of human creatures, and the most terrible in his power. Was he a misanthrope? no, he was too good, his heart was too pure and consecrate for that. Compare him with those of his age—oh, how unutterably boyish appeared the workings of their ambition, compared to his! Years were as weeks with him, in his plans. Experience had taught him to depend upon himself, and he had soon learnt that it is the beginning only which is truly difficult, and that most of our fellow men are wearied before they begin. His ambition was silent, meditative, solemn. His deep voice, his gathered brow, which, even in the sunshine of his spirit, and no spirit had more of sunshine in it, at times,—stood often, intensely wrought and alarming—the fearful steadiness and lustre of his eye, as he listened and thought; the bright, eager, broad flashing of mind that broke out, when he was suddenly excited, were altogether so significant of a peculiar and high intelligence, that the most familiar of his daily associates, those with whom he went about the commonest affairs of earth, constantly beheld him with an instinctive and profound veneration. This was not shown in words, for, indeed, they hardly knew it, and would never have acknowledged it themselves. The few that knew him had been his enemies: and it was remarked, (and let this be remembered as the strongest of the features that set Harold alone among mankind—) that just in proportion to their former hostility, when he condescended to soothe and win them from it, was their devoted and passionate admiration, when he had succeeded. And he always did succeed. Harold never attempted to make a friend, even of an enemy— but he succeeded. He never trifled, no unhallowed levity was about him. But, if he smiled, his smile was rapturous—it was a smile, indeed; brief, but delightful. And his scorn—his indignant sarcasm—O! it was the hottest lightning of heaven! none might abide it! Others were ambitious. I have seen many such. But with them, ambition was a disease—an intemperate longing—a childish yearning for the end, without regarding the way to it;—an earthly ambition; a feeble and sickly covetousness of notoriety, without the courage to deserve it, or the manhood to persevere. But his—his! it was his life, and blood, and pulse! Look at his brow!—It was written there, as with the impress of Divinity. It was the hand-writing on the wall. It told to the oppressor, as beneath his dark locks it broke out, like an inscription on the forehead of a youthful Jove—`Thy kingdom hath departed from thee.' Look at his eye! It was a feature of inconceivable VOL. I. N meaning—so gentle in its tranquillity, that a child would not fear to disturb it—so wasting in its wrath, that men qualed before it, as before the hot lightning—in tincture, dark, deep, unutterably deep, and yet—deepening with every thought. It was the changeable hue of the tried weapon, tempered in lava—steely, black, and glittering—now, with the tint of the midnight sky, and now, with the reflection of ensanguined cymetar blades. His countenance, common at first, grew awful in your contemplation. It haunted you in your dreams. Its abiding place, when once lighted up, and sanctified with the presence of his great soul, was forever after in the hearts of all that saw it. His tread! but why describe his tread?—It was a voice! His feet spoke. I would avoid the man that trod like Harold, unless I knew him to be my friend. But his voice! it was that, that alone!—the musick of a great heart—the breathing of a trumpet, deep, deep, in the chest—labouring and sounding aloud;—the innumerable and peculiar echoes of innumerable and peculiar passions, were all in it!—all distinctly busy in his strong articulation. I can hear it at this moment!— whole years have passed, and yet I hear it, ringing in the wind—its solemnity, its energy—the brief and terrible transparency, picturing with a startling emphasis, absolutely picturing his words and thoughts upon the mind. God never gave such a voice to a bad man. Its compass was loud, and overwhelming grandeur, the most thrilling and passionate eloquence, down, down, to the deep, dear whispering of heart-broken tenderness. It was musick—the musick of archangels—the throned and beautiful authorities of Heaven. So much for Harold. Approach him, and struck by his collectedness of manner, rendered still more impressive, from the youthful gracefulness of his proportions, you would, and why, for the soul of you, you could not tell, grow restless and dissatisfied with their contradictions. His age, was always the first question of them that saw him, for the first time. But hark! he is betrayed into emotion—he alters his voice! heard ye ever such tones, so energetick, peculiar, firm, passionate, earnest? How he lifts you along with him! Do you like him? no. Whence your interest? whence your breathless attention? your fixed attitude? your unclosed lips? Know ye the cause? dare ye analyze it? know ye not, that it is the homage of your spirit to his? he treads among you like a celestial among the creatures of earth. `Your stars stand still before him!' Your mind, your faculties descend from their thrones, and lay down their sceptres at his bidding. His silence is rebuke and faintness. His look fires you with enthusiasm. Listen to him! observe ye how confidently, and yet, not boastingly, he speaks, or rather meditates, aloud. Follow the fervid action of his mind. Mark its celerity, its inconceivable velocity. Can you bear its approach? Does not yours tremble and shiver with the contrast? Has he—that boy, been accustomed to dictating to gray beards? look at him—do you not see his restless nature perpetually poising her wings?—the unslipped falcon brandishing her plumage for some forbidden flight! the flame of his innermost temple constantly breaking out into irradiations—showing all the mysterious dwelling places, the unvisited recesses—the `holy of holies'—where abides the treasure of his worship!—what is she? who is she? Lo! she is there!—her naked feet upon a brazen chariot, a whirlwind of smoke and dust rolling about her!—her head encumbered with stars!—her locks streaming, like a rent banner, in the wind—her chariot wheels rolling over, and grinding to dust, the shattered and glittering fragments of an empire—an eagle, with thunderbolts upon her right hand—her garments rolled in blood! There! there! forever there! stands she, the object of his idolatry. Hark!—hear ye not the far-off barbarian gong!— The isles of the ocean are in arms. The daughters of the blue Pacific are in battle—Look! look! the temple totters in the blue flame of its ascending altar! It dissolves—the firmament reddens—It rains fire! and the smoke drifts like a hurricane by us! A shout—the clouds are rolling away. A continent breaks upon our view—the shores, the islands are peopled, and joyous with the wild musick of many nations—feathers in their hair—their idolatrous temples vanishing—their bows unstrung—their quivers untenanted—and the green wilderness rising behind them. What think ye of his dreaming? and is it dreaming? May not—are ye sure that the inheritance of the Indian may not, even yet, be plucked from the spoiler? May not, oh ye that blaspheme the Great Spirit, may not the thunders of the everlasting God lay waste your habitations, prostrate your cities, kindle all your fires with the angry conflagration of his wrath, and re-establish the forest upon the high places of your revelry and abominations? This he has done to many a nation. This he may do to yours. Look ye for Babylon! whither is Jerusalem? ye are but as one Babylon! and who measureth the sins of Jerusalem against yours? Such were the bright and desperate visions of Harold; such the exhibitions of the dreadful spirit, that haunted, and visited, nay, dwelt, within the encrusted lava of his heart. `To Europe! aye, to Europe, then, I must go!' quoth Harold—`and—' he hesitated—`and the sooner, the better.' Sudden in determination as he was, yet was he more sudden in action. He resolved to begin his preparations immediately—determined to go, the moment that he had life enough, with the governour's consent, and under his directions, if possible; if not, without them. Some weeks passed in this manner. He slept little, and ate nothing. Nay, he loathed food—there was a hunger and appetite perpetually gnawing his vitals, which could not be appeased or assuaged by aught of earthly aliment. One evening, however, he awoke, so exceedingly refreshed, and with all his recollections so clear, that he felt as if he could bound into his saddle, and scour hill and plain, as he was wont: He rang the bell, determined to prepare, that very hour, for his departure, in a sloop of war, which, he had been told, was nearly ready to sail; but he was informed that the governour was too ill to receive any communication: and that the lady Elvira refused to see, and had for weeks, any body except her confidential servant. This was very mysterious. Had he been ill so long? Had whole weeks passed? It seemed but as a few hours, only, since, he, himself, had seen her! What should he do? his heart leaped hurriedly at the question. He was already sufficiently restored, he thought, for some audible expression of his gratitude. He should soon be away—never, ah, never to see her again—no more, no more on earth to hear the heavenly murmuring of her voice!—never more to see the blue veins meandering through her transparent forehead, and her tears falling upon his hand! But then, he should go where another dwelt that had been dear to him—another!—as pure, as innocent, and as lovely, but with a loveliness unlike hers— not snowy, but vivid and ardent, burning, and brilliant. And then—when the fond Indian girl, his beloved, his dear, dear, Loena, should lean upon his shoulder, and press his cheek to hers, he should be so happy. So happy, Harold!—beware! even now, while thou art courting back the faint image of Loena, and renewing thy vows of love and tenderness to her, thou art secretly pining to see once more, the haughty loveliness of Elvira, blushing over thee, with a guilty light in her eyes.—Shame on thee, Harold! A light tap at the door, disturbed him in his revery. He started—trembled—with a thousand indefinite, but thrilling emotions. He opened the door himself, softly. What was his disappointment? Heaven only knows what he had expected; but he turned pale, and shivered from head to foot, with a convulsive, sick shivering, as a servant reached him a brief note, scrawled with a pencil. It was in these words, and evidently written with extreme effort. `Harold! you are well. The governour is no longer your father. You must abandon this habitation. Wait not for the order. Farewell! E.' N 2 Harold was thunderstruck. What could she mean! just at this moment, too, when his heart was overflowing with gratitude! just when he was going, voluntarily, and proudly—to be turned out of doors! oh, it was too much! He recovered himself: a few scalding tears came to his relief. The bitterness of his heart rose to his mouth; he could taste it. He writhed and stamped, in the first agony of his rage and vexation. A dead silence followed. He stood like a statue. His heart scarcely heaved. His lips moved not. A sense of forlornness and desolation came over him, and he would have thrown himself down and wept, but he felt that he could not shed a tear, if it were to save his soul from utter perdition. A hollow whisper broke from him, at last—`turned out—turned out—neck and heels —wounded and bleeding—turned out of this house. This!—oh, shame on him—why plucked he me from my kindred? I was the young wolf. Hath he tamed me?” His lip quivered—a deadly paleness followed— hectick—a few more tears, and it was all over. He was a man, again. The girl stood before him, stupified with amazement, and quaking in every limb, at the terrible alternations of wrath and tenderness that she beheld—but now, when he addressed her calmly, so calmly, that his voice fell, syllable by syllable, like the low notes of a near instrument, blown by a master, she was awe-struck. The flashing of his eyes had terrified her; but this unnatural calmness was abundantly more terrifick, even to her simple and inexperienced observation. `Go,' said he, `go to your mistress, Martha—tell her—God bless her!—God in his infinite mercy, comfort and bless her!”—the brightness of his eyes waned a little, and there was a slight hollowness in his tone— such were the only appearances, and yet, he was choking, choking!—`Tell her I am going: that I shall go, forever, and ever—this hour—this moment. No, Martha, you are deceived—I am strong, very strong. I thank you for your compassionate looks, my good girl, but I am determined. The note is here, here!' he repeated—crushing it, and thrusting it in his bosom—`I shall never part with it. It was unkind, abrupt—but tell her that I bless her for it. I am going, Martha.' As he said this, he began buckling on his sword, but his hand shook so, that he was unable to complete it. He saw Martha, lingering. He blushed at his weakness. His manhood came back to him again, like a torrent. He stood erect—tried again—strained the belt about his attenuated form, almost to snapping, and looking once more about the apartment, prepared to go. She departed. Martha preceded him but a few steps. He heard a door open, and shut—a few hurried questions urged, and replied to in a soft voice, full of anxiety and earnestness, within an apartment near to which he passed. He descended softly—it was evening—with his sword under his arm, and his pistols in his girdle. It was dark, perfectly dark, in the long damp hall of the mansion. He felt something pass near him. He shuddered, and shrunk back—recoiling quite to the wall, before he had presence of mind to seek the cause. He continued his way. The star-light trembled through a high window upon the dewy and solitary stone steps, by which he was to pass. The last time he had passed them—when was it?—when he was brought in upon a litter, the preserver of him who now turned him, naked and shivering, sick and alone, upon the world. An exclamation half burst from his lips—He encountered something—a hand touched his—it thrilled through and through him. It was cold, and trembled. The dim outline of a human figure could be indistinctly traced against the near white wall. His heart almost leaped from his bosom! Could he be mistaken! Oh no—no! He knelt, knelt frantically, and pressed his lips again and again, upon the cold hand, with the deepest veneration. It was wet with other tears than his:—a struggle—a half articulate sob—and a whisper of `God forever bless thee!'— and the hand was withdrawn—the spectre gone—and Harold upon his face. He awoke. Where was his spirit then? Chilled, chilled, horribly chilled. His blood felt thick—and he cared not if he never arose gain. His temples—his very arteries were sore with the excess and rapidity of his recent sensations. He arose. It was in vain. He was weak even to helplessness—what could he do. Return?—Return! no—never!—death were ten thousand times better. He had been driven forth with dishonour and contempt. He was too proud to ask why, or wherefore. It was enough for him, that it was so, and he would have immolated himself upon the threshold of the habitation that he had saved—more than once, from fire and sword—but for a new feeling—a desire of vengeance almost, that had taken possession of him. Was the note kindly meant? It was. To return then, even for an hour, was to slight the admonition, the interposition of an angel—to be weak, very weak; and when he went again—would that hand, that blessed hand, again go with him, again palpipate, like a living heart, within his delirious grasp! Oh no!' He roused himself. The weariness and dislike to reaction, after such intense excitement, were speedily dissipated, by the passionate vehemence of his efforts. He crawled first—then tottered—then, heated by the movement, walked—and finally, as the morning air blew freshly upon him, and the beautiful day-light shone upon his forehead, he absolutely ran. But his running was the peculiar race of the unwearied Indian. `One more hour!—one little hour!' cried Harold, towards evening, `and I am at home!' Another hour, and he was at home, in the thick green wood—a living fountain at his feet, the wild ash bending over it: a hunting cabin within a few paces, where he had slept, night after night, with white men, before the last quarrel with the Indians. It had not been visited of late, he supposed, as the collected fuel, food, ammunition, skins, and utensils were all as he had seen them last. He threw himself, worn and exhausted, upon a bed of dry leaves, and bear skins, and slept, Oh! how deliciously. He dreamt of home—the home that he had left, of his father—his murderers—Strange, wild and incoherent cries rang in his ear. A shot—He started upward. It was dark—perfectly dark about him, and it was some minutes before he could recollect himself. The smell of powder was about him, but where was he? In his chamber? He felt about. All was vacuity and dreariness. Whatever he found was in the wrong place—all relationship was confounded. A confused recollection of the past crowded upon him. Step by step, he recovered his senses: and, as he did, he feared to breathe. Was he in the cabin yet? Could he have slept so long? What means that glimmering?—Gracious heaven! something—some detestable creature is crawling through the fire!—the fire!—he had left none. He felt for his pistols—They were gone—his sword. `Ah, thank heaven!' he almost articulated aloud, as he felt the hilt, and unsheathed it, in silence. The flame rises. Gracious heaven!—what does he see? Why rolls young Harold's eyes so terribly upon the roof. Why starts out the hot sweat upon his forehead. The spirit of his father is before him! The hair of his flesh rose. He gasped for breath. He heard a voice. It was not his father's. It was not Logan's! A huge shadow, sat in its cumbrous drapery, of unearthly dimensions, warming its great hands over the expiring smoke and flame. How came he there? Harold shuddered. The voice continued. It was not—Oh, no!—it was not human! It was sepulchral. It sang, in hollow cadences, a fearful, wild, monotonous, and almost inarticulate song: the dread melancholy musick of an incantation. The figure stirred the fire. It flashed briefly upward for a moment:—the shadow arose, stood before it, a pillar of shapeless, flowing drapery.[2] [2] This incident is so like one in the Pirate, that we feel it our duty to protect the author from the charge of plagariasm, by stating the fact, that the manuscript of Logan was in our hands, long before the Pirate appeared. Publishers. `God of heaven!' cried Harold, horrour struck—All was instantly dark. Harold covered his face with his hands. He heard a loud rushing above him, as of suddenly extended and great wings. He was fanned by cold drapery, that swept by him. Oh, Spirit of the terrible Logan,' he cried, `thou, who camest to confirm thy child, in the oath by which thou hast bound him. Oh, spare him!' Thus he lay—upon his face—trembling in every joint, until a gleam of light made him look up. A bluish, cold glimmering, played through a part of the shattered roof, upon the wall, by his face. It was some minutes before he could persuade himself, that this weary and endless night, had, at length, passed away. To him, it had threatened to be perpetual. He arose, and went out into the cool air. It was moon-light—the day had not yet broken; but the lustre that was showered upon him, was so holy, and dewy, and clear, that his heart heaved in his bosom. He thought of his pistols. It was incomprehensible that they should have been taken from him—it was impossible—if the spectre that he had seen, was only a shadow—or, if his senses had deceived him. He returned, and found them. One had been discharged! Both were loaded when he slept. He now remembered the smell of gunpowder, and the shot that awoke him. Perhaps he had discharged it himself, in his dream, or by accident: and this, he was fain to believe, as the only rational means of accounting for what he had heard and seen. It was necessary to keep them loaded. Luckily there was ammunition concealed in several places about the cabin. A few moments search brought sufficient to light, for all his purposes. Having loaded his pistol, and chosen a few balls, that fitted, and secured them, together with a few charges of powder, he had leisure to feel the consequences of his fatigue and abstinence. A raging hunger possessed him; doubly irksome and distressing at this time, from his long confinement, during which his diet had been little else than that of the cameleon; and from the extreme irritability and fastidiousness of his stomach. He began his search, with a faintness and anxiety that were entirely new to him; and soon had reason to bless himself for the providence and charity of his earlier hours; for he fell upon some provisions, which, in his hunger, appeared exactly what he most coveted, and which, he, himself, had concealed, with his own hands, many months before, in the belief that they might be useful to some weary and worn hunter, who should happen to have more sagacity than the wild animals. Gradually, but by flashes, during his repast, as he sat under the mountain ash, and watched the cold, bubbling water below, shining in the moonlight, the incidents of the past night broke upon him, till the whole became illuminated. A dream opened upon him. He threw down his food, and started from the seat. Now, now, for the first time, the barrier between what he had seen, and what he had dreamt, became, for a moment, distinctly visible He pressed his hands upon his forehead—his shut eyes ached with the intensity of his efforts at reminiscence. He beheld himself, or one habited like himself, at least, toiling in a deep valley, with a wild beast afar off—the star-light all about, of such a preternatural brightness, that it shone through and through the solidest rocks—the very trees and skies were transparent, and the mountains themselves revealed all their treasures. He started—could it be? He wiped the sweat from his forehead, and opened his eyes. `Am I wounded?' he faintly said to himself, as he began an agitated examination with his hands, of every part of his body. He felt his blood thrill, as he touched the handle of his knife—it was wet and adhesive to the touch. He plucked it from its sheath; it was bent, as with the mortal blow, of an arm that could drive it, up to the haft, through the ribs of a man—and was tarnished and discoloured with a black, very black fluid. His heart sickened, and he dared not examine further. But where had he been? What unknown perils had he encountered? Had his delirium returned? Had he wandered? But who led him back to the cabin? Now he recollected, faintly, and at intervals, with a terrible circumstantiality, that he had dreamed, as he often had before, of being pressed to the earth with the weight of a mortal foe; that he had stabbed him with his knife, and that the detestable blood had spouted all over his face and eyes. Still there was a strange and bewildering combination of the visionary and real, in all that he was able to recall. That he had had a terrifick dream, became more and more probable, but that he had tasted blood, again, notwithstanding his abhorrence and loathing, in a delirium, was certain. Where had he been? Whom had he slain? His pistols too, there was no vestige or trace of their employment, in his mind. At this moment, by the turning of his course around a jutting rock, overhung with superb and boundless foliage, pendant almost from the sky, he came, all at once, upon a wide landscape!—water, cliff and wood —a path trodden and regular—a cascade—what disturbs him? Why that look of amazement? Hath he been here before? He looks anxiously about—he discovers a track—onward he leaps—onward! onward! The circumstances of his dream are all before him now! Here had he had been—here! in that very spot, in his delirium. By that shattered and blasted tree it was done!—He pauses—shudders—leans, with a sense of suffocation, against the rock. He dares not advance a single step. What tremendous mystery was this? What had he done? What deed of blood, in his insensibility? Already was he arraigned for it. Already was the smoking fluid—the livid and gashed body of some human being, within a few, few paces of him!' It was not to be endured! No! He maddened, and sprang forward. Already the wild, withered branches of the accursed and blighted, and blood besprinkled tree were over him. The whole dream rushed upon his brain like a flood of light. He dreaded to look at the spot where the deed had been perpetrated. He stood motionless—his blood crawling like cold serpents, about his heart. `But one step more,' thought Harold, `and I shall know the worst.' He made that one step —the spot was all open to his eye—something dark, shapeless, but wearing, nevertheless, to the fearful apprehensions of Harold, the appearance of a murdered human creature, lay upon the ground, just in the shadow of the tree. `But what is that!' cried Harold, and something that was near the body, watching by it perhaps, crouching, reared itself up, shrieked, and sprang into the tree. Harold was stupified for a moment. But the next, aware of the desperate peril of the instant, his pistol shot rang through the branches— a sullen, quick cry followed, and the animal, whatever it was, leaped upon the ground, from the very topmost branch, and fled, snapping his teeth, and occasionally rearing, probably, with the pain of a wound, perpendicularly, up the near precipice. Harold was appalled, and could only attribute his safety to the fact that this terrible creature, the American panther, was already satiated, glutted, with some horrible spoil. He dreaded to approach the body beneath his feet—dreaded to turn it upon its back, lest he should find its face without form or shape, from the abominable appetite of the monster that had departed. At this moment, his attention was caught by a sound, and he saw the same animal leaping from crag to crag, and flying before a dreadful apparition that shouted after it, and pursued it, with a voice of terrifick loudness, resembling that which he had heard in his sleep. `Surely I am dreaming yet!' cried Harold. `Merciful God! let me not dream forever! Oh, I am weary, weary—when will another day break upon me? My senses are useless to me. I dare not trust them. But no, I will not be thus intimidated. I will know the worst.' He leaped down by the body, and stood over it. The form was of him that he had seen, in his dream. He turned it over, impatiently; the face was horribly rivetted, and ghastly. `Yes, yes, that was the man whom he had encountered, and slain.' He looked again, and shouted and clapped his hands for joy! `It is! it is! Logan, I thank thee. Thou art avenged. Behold the third of thy murderers. I have slain him in my madness! I remember it now. I remember that I caught him kindling a fire in my cabin—I awoke—leaped upon him. He fled—he fired—I overtook him, here! here! upon this very spot—and slew him! Behold his blood!' As he said this, he tore off his blanket—its folds clung together—it was saturate with blood, and pierced with many blows. `This was my dream! Oh, no, it was no dream. It was a drama, wrought with this very knife —this very arm—on this very spot!' VOL. I. O And yet, was it not incredible, surpassing all belief, that he should have grappled with the deadliest of his foes, one that had haunted his steps so long; one that was probably lurking for him at the time, and yet escape, mad as he was, unharmed? Could he be satisfied with this inquiry? Was it in the nature of man not to be disturbed?—yea, even to the dividing asunder of soul and body, at the awful indistinctness, the apalling mixture of reality and dreaming, in these discoveries? What had he done else? With whom else had he battled in his sleep? These were questions never to be answered. And yet, there had he been, there! out under the midnight heaven —under that scathed tree, to whose history, and that of the bleak and barren solitude about, were allied ten thousand frightful stories of Indian superstition—a place that, for ages, the beast and the bird of prey had haunted for food—a tree that had been there—the same, unchanged, unshattered, unbowed—with never a branch, nor a leaf the less (so said the oldest of the red men,) from beyond time—centuries had rolled away—storm after storm had beaten upon it—rain after rain—and yet was it, forever, unworn and unwet— again and again, had it been in a blaze, from head to foot with the lightning of heaven—again and again, had the thunder and the earthquake shaken all the trees around, root and branch—nay, the very fountain that crept round it, so darkly and sluggishly, that had been dried up again and again, by the hot storming of the skies, and yet this tree, this old and awful, sapless and withered tree, had withstood it all—all the elements— all the principles of decay—had stood there, like an indestructable shadow, undiminished, unshaken, unsubdued! Not a blade of grass lay within its shade. The very soil was brown, and hot, and arid, like pulverised iron. That his knife had struck a deadly blow—that it had searched, fatally searched, the vitals of something alive, within a few short hours, was abundantly evident, for the blood was hardly yet coagulated upon the hilt; and as the morning light broke, at last, upon his hands, he discovered that they were stained, and that the hot life stream had, as he had dreamt, spouted over his forehead and eyes. He descended to the water, and, as he stooped over it, for the purpose of washing away the loathsome pollution, he shrank back, and turned deadly sick, at the sight of his reflected visage. There was a red crust upon his lips; and the print of a bloody hand upon his own throat. He stooped again. He was wounded, and the action of his body as he leant forward, tore away his shirt, which had become glued to a wound in his side. He tore off his garments, and discovered that it was, indeed, new and deep. This accounted for his faintness, and for his return to reason. The loss of blood had restored him. In his instinct, he had probably sought the cabin, and there, as he slept, his delirium passed away with his blood. He felt thankful indeed for his mysterious preservation. He had lived thus, by a continual miracle, through the night. The whole was so wonderful, that it seemed especially adapted to confirm the high minded and visionary boy, in all the devout dreaming of his nature; now, now! could he longer doubt that the preternatural was to be a part of his familiar destiny?—that he was chosen for some momentous work?—appointed to some mighty deliverance? He returned to the cabin, and threw himself, once more, upon the matted leaves, with his pistols loaded, and his naked sabre at his side. While lying in this manner, with his eyes turned up toward the interlacing branches that composed the roof, his eye was taught by the appearance of paper. He arose, and drew it forth. It was a book; a beautiful miniature edition of, what he supposed, by the terminating rhymes, although it was written in an unknown language, to be poetry. He continues turning over the leaves, and dwelling on the exquisite perfection of the engraving— it falls from his hand!—why that trepidation? He catches it up again—runs eagerly over the leaves— presses it, in a transport, again and again, to his heart, and his lips. It is Italian—her favourite language— her favourite author—her favourite poem—Every page is luminous with the trace of her pencil. Somewhat drops from the fluttering leaves. He picks it up. His astonishment appears to increase—he holds up a black lead sketch of himself, and a little garland of withered violets! He turns pale! He remembers them as his own!—they are unaccountably restored; they were unaccountably lost. He stands, with his heart hushed, and his eyes cast down, as if he had unwittingly opened the presence chamber of something celestial. The sketch and wreath drop from his fingers. He leant his face upon his hands. Warm tears trickled through them. The sight of this little book brought it all to mind, how and where he had first seen the lady Elvira. He was a boy then—a mere boy —unlikely, not only from his youth, but from his education, which was only that of a soldier, to kindle, in the contemplation of a high intellect, enthusiastically brightened; and yet, he could not but remember—he never had forgotten—he never could forget—that when he first saw her, her of whom it was now guilt for him to think at all—it was in summer—on a holy and quiet evening: the long windows were open—the whole apartment was filled with an intoxicating vapour—the aromatick breathing of ten thousand beautiful and moist wild flowers, that had been transplanted, and nourished and tended by her hands, and taught to steal upward and about, all over the walls, and ceiling, and drapery of her favourite summer house. All the lights were placed afar off, and glittered, along a dim piazza that extended from the house, upon the innumerable, and beautifully painted garlands that shadowed and festooned all the pillars, and trailed in luxuriant embellishment from all the windows. But just enough light was given, to throw an aerial hue of witchery, transparency and enchantment, upon every object of tenderness, taste or feeling. She was there. A loose dress, after the manner of the Oriental, of thin muslin, was wrapped, negligently about her, in shawl-like undulations—she was lying upon a sofa—not like an Eastern voluptuary—but rather like the intellectual Cleopatra, or Aspasia, with her soul breaking out, like twilight, from her moist eyes. The sun went down at her feet, as in worship, pouring in upon her, as he departed, a flood of shining carnation and gold. The whole western sky—nay, the very rocks and woods, seemed to arise in vapour, as if they were exhaling in the fervid presence of their God. A lute was by her side—untouched—unprofaned. The sun-beam trembled upon it, but it answered not. It was silent. The enchantment was too deep for its voice. The statue of Memnon, itself, had been mute as death, at such a moment. She read aloud. Harold was overcome. Why, he knew not. She read in an unknown tongue. But she felt, and thrilled; and therefore, he felt, and thrilled. Nay, the very lute appeared to murmur, now and then, in his ear, as he leant over it, as one delicate instrument will answer to another, when touched tenderly, and both are in unison. Her face was vivid, insupportably vivid, with expression, at times: at times, her eyes shot fire as she read. At times, her frame shook, and she appeared dilating with some stupendous conception of the author. And then—her countenance would change—her colour would fade, and come and go—her passionate voice would linger and languish, in broken intonations— her eyelids would droop, like snowdrops, surcharged with dew. Who could resist her? an Indian boy? Could he, of all the beings of this earth, to whom are given the prerogatives of intellect? What were his feelings? young and untutored as he was—ignorant of the laws of society—unswayed—uncultivated—untaught—never, oh, never, had he felt at all before, in comparison with the utter cruelty and agony of his heart, when he saw a man approach, and throw himself by her side, and caress her. He shook his head—he half unsheathed a dagger, in his concealment. At the same moment, he broke the thraldom that held him upon the spot; put aside the curtain that concealed him, and stood by her!—his O 2 black hair writhing over his agitated front, and his black eyes streaming with fire. The lady shrieked, and fainted. The boy fell upon his face, as before a divinity—the man raised him—he was deadly pale—the cold dew stood upon his forehead. He broke from the arms that held him—threw himself at her feet and clung to her, with such a look! so piteous, so imploring, so full of awe! She shrieked again distractedly—and her eyes rolled, as if she saw a spectre; she shrunk from him, trembling in every joint—`oh, begone! begone!' she cried. `What art thou!—leave me! leave me!' Harold was chilled to the heart. She had never forgiven him—till of late; but the man, whom he saw, had. He was her husband—the governour; and had wearied himself with endeavouring to overcome her mortal terrour of Harold. He had succeeded: wo to him!—wo! wo!—His wife was no longer his. Such was Harold's first glimpse of the lady Elvira. The remembrance was painfully distinct. Years had passed away; all his character had changed; he was now a man. He had seen her since, in his maturity, and often had he seen that very book in her hands. Nay, he had once listened to her, as she related to another, the effect of his sudden, and wild apparition before her, with such earnestness, such mysterious tenderness, that he had held his breath to hear her. This book was a treasure to him. He deposited it in his bosom; and then, as an offering that could not be mistaken, the silent oblation of the heart, he determined to study the language in which it was written; and hence, he would be able to commune with her spirit, even in its most secret and innocent thinking, however widely they were separated. Every mark of her pencil, every scored passage, yea, every word that he should find marked emphatically, would be a key to some peculiarity of her heart. He remembered the paper that had fluttered and fallen, as he first ran over the leaves. He took it up again. He examined it. The outline was his own—it was bold and spirited; but surely—yes—it was so— the finishing was by another hand. Need he ask what hand? on earth, there was but one, that could touch with a confidence so suprising:—but one that could produce such a startling effect. The more he gazed, the more was he flattered by the exceeding accuracy and vividness of the resemblance. It was significant of extreme study and application. His cheeks burnt; and his heart beat with tenfold trepidation. He continued, hardly conscious of what he was about, shuffling over the leaves. Another sketch struck his eye—a single glance showed him the subject. His confusion and dizziness increased. His heart told him that it was like himself, at a much earlier day; nay, more—for who shall mistake the mysterious intelligence of young hearts, in their electrick communication?—he was equally sure that the picture was drawn for him years before, and that the peculiarity of his look and manner,—the menacing and terrifick earnestness of his attitude and lip, were all faithfully his own, when he first broke upon Lady Elvira! There was a motto, almost illegible, in Spanish.—`Cuidado!—aguarde vim!' He threw himself upon the bed again: clasped his hands over his hot eyeballs, and endeavoured to shut out the thought that crowded upon him. `I will write, by heaven!' he cried, starting up, and tearing a leaf from the book, and writing—agitated even to death:—`Farewell! farewell, forever!' Could he send it? of what avail would it be to him, or to her? why wound her so cruelly? did he indeed mean to bid her farewell forever?—to forget her? then, he should not write. If he did not mean it, how cruel, how unworthy of him, was such mockery!—`yes— yes—I will write to her, reason with her,' he cried; and the tears trickled down his face—`and then we will part, forever and ever, indeed.' He wrote: `Farewell, lady, farewell. I have found in the hunting cabin—knowest thou where it stands?—near the haunted tree, a book. Knowest thou that book? It is mine. There are—oh, forgive me, thou who hast tempted, and triumphed, and trampled on me—thou, oh, woman, who hast taught me to scorn myself—to deride my destiny, to disregard all the admonitions of manhood—to tremble before thee, as in the anger of the Great Spirit—to grow faint and feeble at the thought of thee, to prostrate myself, and weep, yea, weep! and sob! when I dream of thee!—I know not what I am saying—there are traces of thy spirit upon its pages. Among them, I have found a wreath of violets. It was very dear to me once. I know not how I lost it—and now, I care not. It has no value now, in my eyes. It lies at my feet—I should not deign to pick it up, inestimable as it has been to me, were it not consecrated by thy touch—thy breath, perhaps, lady—nay, why not? thy tears. The white man may call this vanity; he may smile, and ask why thou shouldst weep over a wreath of faded, withered, innocent, little violets? I should scorn to tell him. I need not tell thee. Upon that chain, I have wept many a tear before I lost it—but it was after I saw thee—it was the last gift of the kindest, the gentlest heart, that ever beat—nay, lady, even gentler and kinder than thine own, but not so wonderful, not so exalted. That little circlet—those delicate blue flowrets were her last present. We parted. I loved her. I loved her gift. I thought that I should have gone distracted, when I lost it. I have found it again. I cannot weep over it, now. I cannot touch it with my lips. Tell me the reason. If I preserve it, it will not be for her sake. For whose, then? lady, thou knowest well—nay, nay, I will not preserve it, I cannot. I have enough to remind me of—of thee, lady, without that. But I cannot tear it, I cannot trample on it, I cannot scatter it profanely—but—there! it is done—I have buried it. I will never look upon it again. It has reproached me for the last time. `O, lady, I must bid thee farewell. I must stop—I cannot bear to think of thee, now. Her image is before me, poor, dear, Loena!—thy melancholy eyes—thy trembling lips almost touch my face. Oh, leave me! leave me! wouldst thou have me tell thee, dear, that I no longer love thee!—that I love—almighty God! that I love the wife of another man!—ha!—I thought so! thou art gone—vanished!—I knew that would scare thee—oh, my brain! my brain!— * * I am more composed. I have been laughing, laughing! I know not why, lady. But when the poor girl left me, I thought that my heart would break, and yet, I laughed. The noise is ringing in my ears yet. I cannot bear it. It is the voice of a madman. Am I mad? I hope not. A whole day has past. I am better, but very weak. Thy husband—I can bear to write his name now, thou seest:—but this is the third time that I have tried. He has been with me. He is very angry. His countenance was black;—lady, let me whisper it to thee—hush—he says—no, no, I cannot. I cannot shock thee with his blasphemies. Thou art innocent—art thou not?—am not I? what have we done?—aught that thou and I should tremble for? * * * * It is his own fault; why did he tear me from my kindred? Then I was callous—insensible—innocent. But no!—no!—thou hast awakened me, thou!—and I bless thee for it. It is to thy benignity and elevation, proud lady, that I owe these devouring, but ennobling sensations. The flame that thou hast kindled, purifies, although it consumes me. Lady!—what will become of me? Thou hast taught me to abjure mine Indian gods—to become an apostate to the religion of my fathers, with all its noble simplicity, its uncorrupt grandeur and sublimity, and to become, what!—a Nazarene! Yea, thou hast done this, and thou will answer for it. * * * But why rebuke thee! can I blame thee, thou hallowed one? can that religion be other than the true religion, that, which is thine: oh, no! `Thy god shall be my god.' * * * * * * It is midnight. I am the only mortal awake perhaps, within the circumference of many leagues. Art thou watching too? I will believe it—I must. It is the last time that I shall approach thee, and I cannot but linger. Art thou watching, lady?—Let me go out and look upon the sky. `I have been abroad. I have set, with my arms folded, upon the rock by the fountain, until the beautiful moon had rolled away from all her stars, and stood alone, alone! directly over thy habitation. I was sure of it. I was sure that thy blue eyes were upon her, at the same moment. I felt their reflection upon mine— they dazzled me. I felt unhappy—very unhappy— lonely—spiritualized—my tears fell upon my hand— and I have returned. Why is this?—I never wept but once, till I saw thee, lady—I was ashamed of it. But now, I weep continually, and unconsciously—yet my first tears scalded me, and I felt as if I was choking— and now, I am no longer ashamed. I find relief in it. The sockets of my eyes feel hot, and blistered; and nothing sooths them now, like mine own tears. `A new feeling besets me. * * * A new spirit is within me. I tremble at its stirring. In what unknown language am I speaking? what do I decree! lo, my spirits are all about me, with fiery wings, ready to do my bidding! what wouldst thou, lady? speak, and it shall be done, even to the extinction of the whole human family—the whole!—man! woman! and—no, no, thou and I—and wilt thou let me!—poor Loena—shall we not spare her too? we should not be alone. We should want some human creature to caress, and she is so innocent, so young, so helpless. But no—no!— she shall not survive—she would not—thinkest thou that the dear child would be thy hand-maiden?—oh, no!—speak, Lady, what wouldst thou? they are ready! `Lady, I am very faint. They have left me. I am glad of it. My arteries ached with their presence. I see clearer, now. My forehead, too, is cooler, much cooler —now they have gone. See! those drops—they are not from my eyes. I am broad awake, again. I feel a supernatural striving of the spirit. Words came to me, unincumbered—words, hitherto unknown to me!—burning—burning and bright!—Is it eloquence? It is not the eloquence of the Indian—no—no! There is some new and painful inspiration within me, unknown to the nation of red men. I began—did I not tremble? I knew not what to say—only farewell, perhaps—and a blessing or two—and now!—why, I could write forever, now. Why is this? oh, lady, teach me, what are my duties? whither shall I go? Our religion tells me that we, oh, forgive me!—that we are apart forever, and ever. Must this be? Is there no escape? none? Then what have I to live for? I dare not meet Loena. I cannot meet thee. The spirit of my fathers—the mighty of old, go by me now, unheeded. No longer hold I the sublime communion of my youth, with them that have departed. Why am I thus prostrated, abject? speak, woman, for thou art the cause—thou!—yea, in desperation, I declare it— here! here!—on my death bed—in the wilderness—in the very sanctuary and presence of Jehovah, I do declare, that, thou lovely and perilous one!—thou alone, art my death, and my destruction. I am very faint—very. I know not what I have written. Leaf after leaf have I torn from thy book, till there is not another left, upon which something of thy own dear thought is not visible. I can write no more. Farewell! oh, farewell!—whither shall I go? what will become of me?—Elvira—`cuidado—aguarde ---Lœna!' Harold. He stopped, overcome with his emotions—then enclosed the protrait of himself—folded the letter— charged his pistol—thrust the book and the letter into his pocket, and was departing; when it occurred to him, that he might find a bow and arrow, such as were hung upon the walls of the cabin, of use, in conveying the letter. He took one down, therefore, and sick and wandering as he was, returned upon his steps.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER X. `And art thou, dearest, changed so much? To meet my eye—yet mock my touch! `A long—long kiss—a kiss of youth and love, And beauty—all concentrating, like rays, Into one focus, kindled from above; Such kisses as belong to early days, Where heart, and soul, and sense, in concert move, And the blood's lava!—and the pulse, a blaze! Each kiss a heart-quake!' — * * * `No more—no more—oh, never more on her The freshness of the heart shall fall like dew.' `Oime,voi, mi amate? Oh, who hath not felt, in the short experience of his youth, the trembling, damp, chilly relaxation of some hand that grasped his, in dissolution—and the sick, sick yielding of the fingers, as they strove to cling, yet a little longer, to something that had life and substance in it? who hath not felt a like moisture and chilliness upon his heart?—the sweat of death? and, who hath not? no matter how short may have been his bright and blessed, or weary and wasting pilgrimage, upon this earth—who hath not leant over some dear one, with her swimming dark eyes uplifted, meekly and patiently to his—not in supplication—not in entreaty— not even in hope—but knowing that no help was near —that prayer was vain—that death was approaching, and reluctant to depart, only because her beloved was near her? who hath not, at some period of the shortest life, felt these melancholy, mournful feelings?—who hath not stood, and bowed, and wept with desolate fervour over the face that he loved?—seen it collapse and fall under the frightful touches of mortality?—remembering how he leant over it, when it heaved with the last effort of expiring life and affection—and remembering also, oh, God! with heart breaking distinctness, all the endearment and tenderness of the past * * hallowed and innocent pressures * * * tones of gentleness * * * * tremulous kisses— * * * * * half-shut eyes—* * * * Father of mercies, why are we so tortured, at such seasons? why are not our senses shut and sealed? our memories palsied? But no—no—no! `Thy will be done!' And who hath not, in the weeping, vital reluctance of his heart, fallen down as the beloved face grew dimmer and dimmer, and waned to blankness in his gaze, in utter prostration and despair—cursing himself, and the light, and almost blaspheming his Maker—himself, for his impotency, and his Maker, for his unmerciful dispensation! Oh, how many are there?—how many, who, could they bear to speak of the desolation that filled them, from the crown of their head, to the sole of their feet, would tell you that it was, as if all sense, all movement, and all animation had left them, while the faint kisses grew fainter, and fainter, of the mouth whereon they dwelt in weeping and terrour? `Father, forgive them, they know not what they do.' Thou hast endowed them with a sensibility that destroys itself:—a nature that, being exhausted, forgets:—the agonizing capabilities of love are too selfish—too impious. When the object of our idolatry is blotted, we would blot out the world; but the very violence and desperation of our grief are its speediest remedies. And then, the exquisite vitality of remembrance, who would exchange it, with all its thrilling, quivering nerves, for torpor and insensibility? We think of her whom we have lost. We see the hectick upon her cheek—the preternatural temptation of her lips—the delicate transparency of her forehead, when the blue tinctured veins grow bluer with the changing of her thought. She is all over pulse, from head to foot—and the unearthly brightness of her eyes is upon us—we think of them—dwell upon them, until we weep, and are relieved. Such were the feelings of Harold. He had, for it was the same to him—he had seen his loved one—dead— dead to him—yea, worse, for she was another's. There was, now no hope in futurity for him! He could not reclaim her in the skies. Nay, he would not dare to meet her there. It was guilt here, to think of her, VOL. I. P would it be less there, to approach her? Yea, he was more incurably, helplessly forlorn than if he had felt her dying breath upon his bosom. Then, there were a tender melancholy—ten thousand fearful remembrances, to sooth and subdue him—to win him into tears. Now, he dared not weep. It were a sin to weep now. Who will condemn Harold? Let him who would not rather see his beloved in her shroud, than in the arms of another—let him cast the first stone. `But one way—one way on earth, is left to me,' said he, as he meditated aloud upon his path. `I cannot forget her. To speak of her would be death to me. My head is strangely disordered, at the thought of her name. `But—' and he trod more loftily with the sublime conception—`I will emancipate myself—my countrymen!—be a hero—a great and good man, and, when we meet again—(he faltered—faltered in the untrodden solitude—and blushed)—`she shall be proud of the Indian boy.' With thoughts like these, he pursued his way, his godlike nature all in commotion, toward the dwelling that he had abandoned. With the elevation of his thought, his language and walk held correspondence. The solitude ministered to him. He mused liked a giant, for he felt like one. There had always been an unstudied, natural, masculine energy in his talk, which had never failed to produce in the hearer, a peculiar promptitude and vigour of reply—a quick, vehement, breathing; but had he been heard now, as he trod onward alone, through the wilderness, communing with his own destiny, he would have been avoided—none would have replied, and none would have breathed in his way. The very thought of his soul, with every transition and change, though rapid and brief as light, could be foreseen upon his countenance.—The movements, within and without, were simultaneous. He has returned. It is evening. He is watching the light of yonder apartment. It is dim as twilight. Is it a sick chamber? Is it hers? His heart knocked against his ribs, and grew suddenly still. Can it be hers? The thought was too painful for suspense. He bounded over the garden wall, forgetful of all precaution, in his anxiety to obtain a view, from some one of the nearer buildings or trees. A large mastiff set upon him immediately, without noise or threat. Harold had no time to soothe the terrible animal—He leaped backward, and drew his pistol—He fired—the dog uttered a low growl, and came limping towards him. Harold leaped upon the wall, directly in full view of the window. A bullet whistled by him, and a bell instantly rang an alarm. The drums of the garrison beat. The windows were closed, and lights were seen hurrying hither and thither, in all directions, over the house. He heard a gate open behind him, and voices approaching.—It was too late to return. The guard were undoubtedly alarmed—the whole town was in commotion, and he would not be taken for ten thousand lives. One desperate chance remained. He leaped from the wall, threw aside his bow and arrows, dashed through the summer-house, ran up stairs, and opened the door of his own room, with the hope of escaping pursuit for a while, there—it was empty, but he had not time to shut it; the enraged mastiff was at his heels, in silence, still—what should he do?—He drove his sword through and through him, and nailed him to the floor. It was with pain that he did it, for the poor creature knew him at last, and actually turned about, with the sword cutting his vitals, and licked the feet of Harold. Harold shuddered. That dog had been his friend more than once—more than once, in battle, and in hunting, had saved him in imminent peril. Harold had loved the dog, and his heart grew big as he thought of the fatality that seemed to assail all that he loved, and all that loved him. For a moment, all considerations of personal safety were forgotten, and he could have said, as a woman has since been made to say: `I never loved a tree nor flower But 'twas the first to fade away; I never nursed a dear gazelle, To glad me with its full, dark eye, But when it came to know me well, And love me—it was sure to die.' But he was soon aroused to a painful sense of his situation. The noise of pursuit approached. The bay of dogs, blood hounds, upon the track of their fellow— voices—and iron heels. What should he do? Throw himself before the door, and battle to the last gasp with his pursuers, while he could stand or sit—treat them, his own soldiers, perhaps, like mortal foes? or should he call upon the lady Elvira to save him?— The thought scorched his brain. What! sneak to a woman's bed-chamber!—His sword is plucked out forcibly from the weltering animal, and he stands upon guard. Now, wo to them that approach! they are on the stair-case. The dogs are held back. A door opens.— By the light, he sees—yes, gracious heaven! it is! it is! lady Elvira, rising from a sofa.—Has the noise just alarmed her? She is alone. Her features are agitated— Traces of weeping are upon her cheek. She is approaching. What! shall he stay here, and blast her fame forever? no—what blindness and infatuation! He closes his door— bolts it—piles the furniture against it—throws up the sash—vaults out upon the piazza—passes her window, throws in the paper—she shrieks, and he is gone!— the noise of his retreat is heard, but the dogs cannot follow him. He is safe. Occasionally a shot rings after him, and a spent ball strikes, now and then, among the branches over his head. But he is safe. He pauses. Shall he pursue his way? or shall he climb this tree? will he not be safer here, until the heat of the chace be over? He mounts it—a nearer one in a higher situation, will answer all his purposes of concealment better, and enable him to watch the movement of his pursuers. He stretches his sabre before him— proceeds with all the wily craftiness of his Indian nature, until he finds a tree just without the wall, far, far, from the sound of the dogs, and firing, which are now heard, at intervals, along the river path. He is now among the topmost branches, completely sheltered from observation. He sees the house all in commotion. The alarming search continues just below him. Whose chamber is that? it is his own;—those dark and awe-struck faces, in consultation, are assembled about the poor dog. They turn him over. They observe the wound in the floor. They huddle together, and cast their agitated glances about. What! do they fear that the arm which could drive a poniard through a plank, is near them? Another group pass, in loud and clamorous outcry, with lights, directly under his feet. Every human being that he sees is familiar to him, yet he dare not speak—his life is hunted—may be taken—and yet he must not open his lips. He is to fall, if he do fall, self immolated. They talk of Indians—hark! an exclamation of horrour breaks from them, all at once! What have they found?—His bow and arrow. Their terrours are confirmed. `The Indians!—the Indians!' they cry: it is re-echoed wildly from the house—`the Indians! the Indians!'— The lady—He had heard her shriek. Might she not have fainted? He almost leaped from the tree, at the thought. He descended instantly, and mounted another, from which, through the partly opened shutters, he could see the whole interior of her room. The light is removed—a shadow, as of one tossing her arms, is seen upon the walls. He leans forward—further—further—the branch yields—snaps—and he is only saved from death by an intervening branch. A worse fate attends him, for a moment; his remaining pistol went off in the fall. The sound is heard, in the absence of the younger servants, by the old butler, who comes out with a light, and looks cautiously about. Harold is afraid to breathe, afraid to make any exertions for his safety, and yet, every moment may be his last, as he hangs suspended only by a fold in his dress. The old man at length returns, and Harold is left to reinstate himself. Hardly has he done it, when the window opens, and Elvira, herself, appears! His heart rises in his throat. She leans out, and looks eagerly around, holding somewhat in her hand—she waves her handkerchief—her handkerchief! no, it is a letter. He is near enough to be heard—the faintest whisper, it appeared to him, could reach her. He whispered. How greatly he was deceived! Such a faint tremulous sound P 2 would not have been heard, amid the sternest solitude, in its most awful silence. He moves—now—now!— her eyes are toward the tree. Does she see him? It was impossible that she should, and yet, Harold could hardly forbear reaching out his hands to her. “Lady”—he articulates.—The sound would have been audible only to love—she heard it,—coloured— withdrew—but stood gazing upon the tree. Harold shook the branches. She trembled and clasped her hands—stood irresolute for a moment—snatched her lute, and touched the only air that ever had appeared to affect him. A pause. She waited the answer— some answer, to convince her that it was Harold:— he repeated the closing words of each stanza—“to thee, love,” in the faintest intelligible sound. It was an echo. Enough! a paper is suddenly folded, and falls fluttering under the tree. He descends—snatches it up— exchanges one salutation—The window is shut—and he is satisfied—happy. Behold him again—once more—in his cabin. He stopped not, rested not on the way;—except once, for a single moment, when he thought that he heard a footstep, and saw, for a single moment, a diminutive shadow, apparently tracking him. It was near the town —and he attributed the appearance to the delusion of his terrour. He has forgotten it now. The door is secure. A fire of dry leaves is blazing before him—and he prepares to read. The note is already open in his hand—why is his hand upon his pistol?—why rises he so slowly?—is he listening? Has he been pursued? A hand is upon the door. It shakes. “A wild beast perhaps,' says Harold;—yet he feels an invincible repugnance to fire, until he is assured that it is. The whole cabin shakes—the door yields— a colossal figure stands before him. He fires. Now, for the first time, he discovers that his pistols are unloaded. He draws his sabre. The spectre turns, and stalks sullenly away. Harold has no power to follow. Why did he not cleave it down? He could not. His blood was chilled—his arm was paralyzed. He could as soon have slain his own father, as lift his hand, in the presence of this tremendous shadow. What was he to think? was the cabin, like the tree, haunted? “Come what, come will,” cried he, at last, “I will not be disturbed again. I will read this note, though the Arch fiend himself stand before me.” He read as follows. “Madman!—That motto has betrayed thee. Thy presumption shall be punished. Canst thou believe that I—I—rash boy, I can hardly bring myself to write the word—love thee! No—it is time that thou shouldst know the truth. How bitterly it makes me repent of my unguardedness. The picture is thine. The motto may, with justice be applied to thee. It should be engraven upon thy front. But why did I preserve it? Why did I finish this which thou hast sent me? Because—and let my words fall upon thee like a thunder bolt—and consume thee to ashes, for thy presumption! —Because they resembled one whom I have loved— and lost; but not thee—oh no—it was not thee! He was a man. “Harold! what fiend possesses thee! I cannot find words to rebuke thee, as I ought; I could even treat thee kindly yet—for his sake,—for the love of him— to whom thou bearest such an unaccountable resemblance—but—I dare not. Therefore—let me never see thee, or hear from thee more; go from me, far as winds and waters can carry thee, and take my blessing with thee, only on this condition—that thou never, never utterest my name again:—my eternal malediction else.” E. Harold was stupified with amazement. His hair rose upon his head. In the first paroxysm of his wrath, he tore his locks, and dashed himself upon the ground. But these transports were brief. His terrible nature arose in arms, at the cry of his soul. His countenance blackened with indignation. He knelt down. His sobs shook the bed. He became composed—stern—stern as adamant. “By the living God!' he cried—“I will be revenged!” He arose. He rent and scattered the cabin—its arms—its furniture—like a whirlwind about him—with his sabre, he hewed down the young ash trees over the fountain— he choaked that up with huge rocks, and, having completed the work of desolation, turned, and struck into the midnight forest, bare headed, and silent as death. On a high precipice at a distance, under the star light, a tall figure stood beckoning to him. He beckoned to it in return, and pursued it, as it walked over the cliff, huge and portentous. Three nights after the alarm, as the lady Elvira was about retiring, she saw a handful of rubbish lying near the bed. She touched it with her foot, and, at the same moment, spoke to Martha. Martha came, and as she was picking it up, for it appeared to be composed of scraps of paper, she kept protesting, that, not a living soul had been in the room since she swept it, except her mistress and herself, and she was—“Bless me, what a face!—why!—as I live —it looks like Mr. Harold himself—as he used to look,” she exclaimed! reaching a scrap to her mistress —“Is'nt it, madam—the very image of him—mercy on us! how pale you look!” Elvira was pale. Here was the picture—the book —and her own letter, torn into ten thousand pieces!— She trembled so that she could hardly stand. Who did this? And where was he? She shuddered as she threw her eyes around the room. Already had her conscience reproached her, bitterly, for her cruelty to young Harold. Already had she begun to relent. Had his apparition stood before her, she could not have been more terrified—or more fully assured, that some tremendous evil had befallen him. And now did she reproach herself again, for the haughty spirit that had destroyed him. She need not have answered his love —she need not have acknowledged her own—for she did love him—but she might have treated him generously, and sealed his heart and lips with kindness— not with death. The incident of the torn papers was at last entirely forgotten, or only referred to, by some accidental remark now and then; but her anxiety to learn what had become of Harold became insupportable. About this time Martha happened to be taken sick, and her place was supplied by the old housekeeper, who was deaf, and almost blind. She was a good nurse, and had prescribed to her mistress just before she retired, a cordial, whose exhilirating effects were instantly visible in her lady. Her eyes sparkled, and her colour came and went, and it was long before she was able to compose herself sufficiently for sleep. She dreamt. The prayer of her whole life was answered. She held the husband of her heart to her bosom. How she knew not—where, she knew not, but she was satisfied. Her beloved had arisen, torn asunder all her engagements, forgiven her, and embraced her, in the sight of heaven and earth. The tears streamed from her eyes. Her sobs of delight and thankfulness were audible. She even strove to awake—but no, no—it was no dream!—How could she think it a dream for a single moment! She resigned herself therefore, to the intoxication of her thought, without reserve. She felt his warm lips upon her cheek—his breath—his affectionate caressing—and she was happy. A sound awoke her. A man was standing at her bed side—his face buried in his hands. In the first tumult of her heart, bewildered and dreaming yet, she reached out her arms to him—saying “my beloved!— He moved not—answered not;—they fell lifeless upon the covering before her. She continued gazing upon him, however, with a fixed look—gradually becoming more and more piteous and distracted, as a horrible apprehension of the truth broke upon her. She put her hands out, once, more timidly toward him,—and articulated, faintly, a name—“husband! my own dear husband,” His hands fell. She shrieked; and fainted. It was Harold! He hesitated—he drew his dagger. He knew not if it were not better to consummate his horrible guilt at once, and let out her heart's blood upon the spot. But no—no! His own then!—the point was already in the air. He relented. Was he not sufficiently avenged? Would he damn her, and himself, forever and ever? Could he cleanse her of all pollution, he would have done it, gladly, gladly, now that his fell purpose was accomplished. There she lay, before him —lifeless—utterly lifeless. He threw himself by her side—kissed her pale lips—her forehead, and called down the curses of heaven upon his own head. She awoke--she opened her eyes. The light of death was in them. She shuddered, and repulsed him—and her eylids shut slowly again. He was desperate. He rang the bell; and it was only, when he heard an approaching footstep, that he reflected on the consequences of his being found in the chamber. Dead or alive, it would be more than death, to the haughty Elvira. For this reason alone, he determined to go. He threw open the long blinds upon the walk, stepped out, and was gone— Onward he goes—behold him now! bare headed— almost naked—unarmed—and helpless. A child might pinion him, hand and foot. The leaves rustle as he approaches, and he gazes upon them, with a vacant eye, as if they were whispering at him. The wild beasts pass him, and avoid him. He neither sits nor sleeps. A shadow is at his side, mocking and leering at him. He turns upon it, now and then, and shakes his head at it, reproachfully, like a heart-broken creature; but his countenance never changes—vacancy and distraction are only legible there. Sometimes he pauses for a moment—thrusts his hand into his bosom—and plays with the ivory tablet which he has so long carried there— attempting, with his fingers, to pull apart the glued leaves, but without any other appearance of consciousness, than the loathing, which his countenance expresses, when he touches his tongue the second time with the same finger, and leaves some of his father's blood upon it. But tis the taste only, not the reflection, that convulses his features. He dashes the tablet from him. Onward he goes. Another spectre, as wild and haggard as himself, is tracking his footsteps. He treads in a circle. He cannot pass beyond the scene of his guilt. Is it that the Almighty holds him, and that each revolution brings him nearer to punishment? He emerges from the wood: he utters a wild cry, and dashes again into the thickest of the wilderness. Break out where he will, there is the accursed chamber, with the window open before him, and the spectre of a man continually stealing forth. Somebody is before him. He recovers for a moment; feels for his arms—they are gone. Where are they? He knows not. Is he to fall a prey here, in his helplessness? He would proceed. An awful voice commands him to stop. A diminutive old man is in his way, with bright, sparkling eyes—a high, bald forehead, and the thinnest gray hair in the world. `What art thou?' said the crazed wanderer. `Harold!' Harold started at the sound of his own name. `What hast thou done?' said the old man. Harold felt like Cain, when he heard the voice of the Almighty walking in the garden. His knees smote together—He fell upon his face. `Arise!' cried the voice. `Arise, unhappy!—henceforth, thou art a wanderer. Go forth. Thou art accursed forever, and ever—thou and thine—thy death shall be a death of violence!' The voice ceased. Harold felt something pass him. He lifted up his face. The old man had gone. Where had he seen him before?—somewhere, he was sure that he had, and that he was a prophet of evil, and had been from his cradle. He began to relapse. Could it then be known? had he not gone secretly about the work of peril? had he not laboured to conceal his preparation? Had not all hell favoured him? where was the servant? why did not the lady awake? what infernal magick had bound her senses so long, so fatally?—and yet, could it be that she did not know me?—oh, heaven and earth!—let me not blaspheme her—she thought me her husband—her husband! curse him! curse him! accursed be he, and his!' `And yet,'—he paused—the smile of Lucifer, himself, glittered for a moment upon his agitated, dark, front—`and yet, what did she worse than the Roman Lucretia—worse! what did she so bad? She should be consecrate forever! She of Rome, yielded—but she, who has driven me mad—oh, God! she is innocent, alike, in thought, and deed. She of Rome, chose to be guilty, rather than be suspected.[3] [3] This is not the raving of a madman. It is time that the hateful morality of that fable (of Lucretia) were trodden in the dust. What is her virtue other than the virtue of appearances? She could have died virtuous. She refused—and was guilty with a prince, rather than be suspected, with a slave. Compare that modesty, with the modesty of the Bible. Read the story of Susannah and the elders. The cases are parallel to a wonderful extent—which would you that your daughter—your wife, or your sister, should resemble? But she! she!—oh, Elvira, forgive me! forgive me!—by my soul, had I ten thousand lives, I would give them all, to restore thee, for one blessed moment, to thine immaculate purity.—And then, I would slay thee, with mine own hand —send thee to heaven, spotless, for my revenge!'</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XI. Her wing shall the eagle flap O'er the false-hearted; His warm blood, the wolf shall lap, Ere life be parted. `She loved, and was beloved. She adored, And she was worshipped, after nature's fashion; Their intense souls, into each other poured, If souls could die—had perished in that passion.' Aus den augen, aus den sinn. Lontan dagli occhi—lontan dal cuore. `Anglice—out of sight—out of mind!— —And scarcely heaved her heart: Her eye alone proclaimed—we will not part' Was this mortal agony to endure forever?—forever, too, amid the magnificent solemnity of night, and solitude? It could not be. Ten thousand bodies might have been shattered to dust; but the spirit, the immortal spirit, fed with such aliment, abroad in such scenery, would have survived it all, and haunted the spot, forever, in awe and admiration. Months and months, however, Harold wandered among the detestable and obscure things of the desert; his flesh was lacerated—he was sore and bleeding, from head to foot—his hair was torn and matted, and nightly he battled with the wolf or the bear, in his desperation, unarmed, but with the branches of some uptorn tree, for a morsel of its execrable food. His living was a continual miracle. The following circumstances gave, however, a new turn to his mind. He was sitting upon the extreme point of a jutting cliff, of a cold wintry morning; it was a favourite place with him. The sun broke out all at once over his head, and the water below rippled like fire. He was tempted to plunge headlong: he half rose for the purpose, when his attention was diverted from the thought, by the sound of a rifle, shot among the near hills. The next moment, an elk broke covert below him, in the mist and shadow, and clattered over the precipice, at his feet. Shot after shot rang after her. She falls. A human creature, indistinctly seen, stands over her. He has felled her with his club. Was he one of the huntsmen? no, for he drags her away, as he would a rabbit, to his den. Is this the spectre that has haunted him so long? Does it come abroad in day light?' With a brief return of reason, Harold determined to pursue it, and was descending for the purpose, when he saw the dim apparition of several hunters, with their dogs in advance, as they turned a jutting rock at a little distance, stop, and while one of their number pointed at him, enter into earnest conversation. Their purpose was soon visible. Their object was to make a prisoner of him. They were Indians, and appeared VOL. I. Q to him, probably, by some optical delusion, of gigantick dimensions. He determined to avoid them; leaped down two successive crags, and came, suddenly, upon a young Indian, who instantly levelled his rifle at him. Harold caught it, struck him to the earth, and pursued his way. The Indian arose, and hurled his tomahawk at his head. Harold answered with a bullet, and brought him from the cliff, headlong, into the water below. At the sound of the shot, three other huntsmen ran toward him. There was no escape, but down the precipice, and down it, he was going, when his course was arrested for a moment, by seeing the same extraordinary being, who, he supposed, had visited him twice in his cabin, emerge from his cave, and go toward them. The Indians threw down their rifles in dismay—one prostrated himself, and the others fled. Harold was intimidated—awe-struck; for a while, he looked upon the party—they vanished in the rolling vapour, upon which the sun at that instant, broke, with inconceivable splendour. Weary of adventure, and once more seriously determined to live, and atone for the fearful transgressions of his hand, Harold now turned his steps, resolutely, toward the tribe of the Logans. `I will go there. They will welcome me, wretched and miserable as I am,' said he, `one, at least, will weep for me, and forgive me: yet, oh, how shall I ever be able to meet her!—that countenance of love—that dark, melancholy eye—that look of innocence, and serenity!' After a toilsome journey of some weeks, he arrived at the village of the Logan tribe. A flag floated from the publick wigwam, a signal that they were in council; it was a red flag too. His heart leaped in his bosom— they were preparing for battle! He was recognished afar off—an aged warrior, and two younger ones approached, with their ferocious, shaggy dogs, who, snuffing the blood of the stranger, were only to be restrained from throttling him, by main force. Their eyes, blood-shot, and fiery, rolled incessantly upon him, and as often as they felt their necks loose for a moment, their hair rose upon their fronts, and they gnashed and snapped their teeth at him. The manner of the old man was cold and imposing; that of the younger ones, irritating, and haughty. Harold felt his blood heating, and turned proudly, and sternly away. Violent hands were laid upon him. The council broke up, tumultuously, and a number of young warriors, their eyes flashing fire, rushed upon him, with uplifted tomahawks. Harold folded his arms, and turned upon them, undismayed—undisturbed. They felt the rebuke, and faltered. The hands of them had held him, relaxed. He broke suddenly from their hold—leaped backward, and drew his sabre. Twenty tomahawks were raised; twenty arrows drawn to their head. Yet stood Harold, stern and collected—at bay—parleying only with his sword. He waved his arm. Smitten with a sense of their cowardice, perhaps, or by his great dignity, more awful for his very youth, their weapons dropped, and their countenances were uplifted upon him, less in hatred, than in wonder. The old men gathered about him--he leant upon his sabre. Their eyes shone with admiration--such heroick deportment, in one so young—a boy! so intrepid! so prompt! so graceful! so eloquent, too!—for, knowing the effect of eloquence, and feeling the loftiness of his own nature, the innocence of his own heart, the character of the Indians for hospitality, and their veneration for his blood, Harold dealt out the thunder of his strength to these rude barbarians of the wilderness, till they, young and old, gathering nearer and nearer in their devotion, threw down their weapons at his feet, and formed a rampart of locked arms and hearts about him, through which his eloquence thrilled and lightened, like electricity. The old greeted him with a lofty step, as the patriarch welcomes his boy from the triumph of far off battle; and the young clave to him, and clung to him, and shouted in their self-abandonment, like brothers round a conquering brother. Harold soon discovered the cause of their convocation. They were that moment meditating a war upon a distant tribe, (one of the Six nations) for the murder of Logan; and there having been some unaccountable connexion between the last mysterious mission of Harold, and the death of Logan, they had begun to think darkly of Harold. Many light circumstances, too light even for the observation of Indians at another time, were now recalled, one after the other—dreams, omens, predictions, voices, to confirm their suspicion. But that which weighed especially with them, was the tale of a hunter, remarkable for his serious, stern, insensibility to all the terrours of superstition, who related, with a continual shudder, which gave his narration tremendous effect on those who knew the constitution of the man, that he had lately encountered, at twilight, in the deepest recesses of their hunting ground, near the haunted tree, the slaughtered Logan, himself! that he was wrapped in the habiliments of war—angry— bleeding, and impatient! This had been the subject of their deliberation, and they had nearly determined, on the first sight of Harold, to sacrifice him to the terrible manes of his own father. But Harold's bearing saved him: and ere another moon, after several exhibitions of his power and activity, he was chosen for the leader of this expedition against the tribe, to which the murderers of his father belonged: a tribe, whose bloody depredation, had been incessant for years. But their cup was now full. They demanded a speech, as they stood, with an awful solemnity, in a group, on the morning of their departure, with all the old men, and women, and children, encompassing them. It was a fierce, cold day, but every human creature stood erect against the wind and rain that drove upon them, bare-headed, and almost naked—the fire that burned within them, glowing at their eyes. `Warriors!' he said, `Brethren!—(their tomahawks were brandished simultaneously, at the sound of his terrible voice, as if preparing for the onset.) His tones grew deeper, and less threatening. `Brothers! let us talk together of Logan! Ye, who have known him, ye aged men! bear ye testimony to the deeds of his strength. Who was like him? Who could resist him? Who may abide the hurricane in its volley? Who may withstand the winds that uproot the great trees of the mountain? Let him be the foe of Logan. Thrice, in one day, hath he given battle. Thrice, in one day, hath he came back, victorious. Who may bear up against the strong man? the man of war? Let them that are young, hear me. Let them follow the course of Logan. He goes in clouds and whirlwind —in the fire, and in the smoke. Let them follow him. `Warriors; Logan was the father of Harold!' They fell back in astonishment, but they believed him; for Harold's word was unquestioned, undoubted evidence, to them that knew him. They approached! they locked hands!—they uplifted them to the skies!—the pipe of peace was broken over their heads, and the ashes given to the wind! The wampum was torn, and buried, and trampled on, where they stood! They lifted all their voices, together! They chanted the tremendous hymn of their tribe, altogether, at the utmost pitch of the human voice! The ceremony was concluded. Harold stood over the fire, and the oldest man among them pronounced his malediction, word by word, on their foe, as the scalp of their greatest enemy, blackened, and crisped, in the flame. `Oh, Logan! oh, my father!' cried Harold, (as the scalp dropped upon the live embers, and shrivelled, and curled, in the offensive smoke that issued from it, and the quick sparkles that it emitted, shot upwards, even to the elevation of his hands.—The old men shook their heads, and turned away their countenances, mournfully from him.) `O, Logan! oh, my father! thou wast terrible in fight! Be thou with us! Thy son—thy children, move forward to avenge thee. Be thou with us!' The hatchets rang. The last arrows, with scarlet plumage, flew upon the wind, toward the habitation of their enemy; and the circling trees around, seared by the whirled tomahawks, gave terrifying evidence to the kind of combat that was to follow—no quarter?— none! Q 2 They departed. Harold's blood thrilled. This was what he wanted—this!—it was employment, occupation to his spirit. Like the Spartan, battle to him was pastime: its fierce inquietudes, and `stern alarms' musick, and rapture. They fell upon their enemy, at midnight. Not one, not one! man, woman, nor child, was left to tell the tale—not one! They swept over them like a whirlwind of fire: and the dust of their skeletons, the cinders of their tribe, were scattered to the four corners of the earth. The depth of an American forest, and a sheet of boundless water, reddened with the long, trailing— flaky—storm of burning ashes, that went, in a high wind, from the place of sacrifice. Sudden cries were heard, as of wild beasts, in the air—men started at the sound, and looked up, and saw the heavens on fire! and thick smoke, driving like a tempest, over them! `The day of judgment! The day of judgment is come!' they cried. The noise of battle and murder, went by, in the dreadful darkness—and then, all above grew unutterably black—not a star was to be seen—not a sound was to be heard. Men thought that the skies had passed away, forever! Harold returned. His march had been extermination. Like the Lacedemonian, he never gave a second battle to the same people. But how felt he? was his heart quiet—his conscience? no!—no.—He loathed himself more than ever, and flew for many months afterwards, from shock, to shock; less from an appetite for blood, than in the hope of drowning the cries of humanity within him—the curse of innocence, was upon him— of innocence deflowered, and perishing—He could have lain down, and rolled in the dust—dug his own grave, with his own fingers, to find one moment's repose. But no—the hottest agonies beset him, night and day—amid the tremendous repose of the region where he trod, and the conflicting uproar of that, upon which he speedily emerged—the empire of thunder, and earthquake. He forsook the council. He kept aloof from his companions. He brooded alone, on the ways of providence. Nothing but disorder was visible to him. A whole year did he thus wear away, in alternate battle, bloodshed, and reflection. Nothing but disorder was visible to him. But his steps were pursued; and one day, as he was meditating alone, by a dark stream, an aged man arose before him, as from the earth, and rebuked him. `Thou art unhappy,' said he. `Is it not the work of thine own hands? Thou thinkest that good and evil are unequally distributed. Thou art wrong. I am older than thou. I find that they are not. Who has not his sorrow?—insupportable, at first, but light, and easy, after a time? Look about thee—seest thou one human being with whom thou wouldst exchange lots?' `One, father!—yes—thousands!' `What!—health, name, age, friends, talents—all— in every particular?'—Harold hesitated. `Young man, I am old now. For more than three-score winters, I have asked that same question to the children of sorrow and suffering; and never yet did I find one that answered me, yes; no, never! and I have asked it of the dying man, in his extremity. O, how equally are good and evil distributed!' `Father! Is this satisfactory? It is not to me. We learn to bear our own evils; our constitution, physical, and intellectual, learns to accommodate itself to whatever ailment we may be visited with. This we know in our own case, but we do not so plainly know how our neighbour is able to bear this.' `My son! thou hast answered thine own question. Is not this satisfactory? why choose we our neighbour's blessings? because we know not what drawback he may have upon them? Why avoid we his curses? because we know not what secret comfort he may have to counteract their malignity. Hence our discontent? hence our covetousness!' `But father, is not evil abundantly more active and efficient, than good? what is there worth living for?' `Young man, this is shocking impiety. Is God good? Is he wise? You shudder. He is wise. He is powerful. He has the wisdom to plan, and the power to execute, what he wills.' `O, yes, his power and his wisdom, are obvious.' And so is his goodness! Did he delight to torment us, could he not quicken all our senses, till our very breathing, and seeing, and hearing, were agony?' `He does, father, at times.' `And why does he? Are not these symptoms of discase?—warnings?—prohibitions?—`But why are they necessary?—If God be so good, why afflict us with pain, at all? why not make us perfectly happy, at once?' `Because he does nothing, at once. It is not the way of his providence—he acts by the simplest means: our religion!—' `Our religion!—who art thou?' `A Christian, I hope.' A Christian! a Nazarine!—leave me.' `Never!—hear me. I command thee to hear me.' Harold held his breath, in amazement. What was this that dared to pursue him to his hiding-place?—that commanded him, with the look, and emphasis of authority?—His dazzling eyes reminded him of some that he had seen before. He obeyed—awe-struck, and silent. `Boy! hear me! Thou hast dared to question the way of God. He has commissioned me to pronounce thy condemnation. Let me proceed. He could change all hearts, at once: he could have peopled all this earth, at once; he could cover the face of it with trees at once, without the preliminary growth, blossom, and budding. But these things are contrary to his way. He is uniform—and therefore, does he not make his creatures perfectly happy, at once?' `But what is thy notions of perfect happiness? speak!' `I know not,' said Harold. `I am appalled. I know not with whom I am sitting.' `Is it that of the missionary? He told thee that in heaven, thou shouldst have every hope of thy heart, gratified. Is this perfect happiness? no; it is the very definition of perfect misery. What is perfect misery? It is that situation where you have nothing to hope for.' `Why is there any pain permitted here?—That sympathy, patience, fortitude, tenderness, constancy, manhood, affection, and every virtue of the human heart may be made to appear. Were there no pain, there would be no suffering, no consolation, no sympathy, no patience, no resignation, no virtue.' `Why is any pain permitted?' `Yes, tell me,' cried Harold, `why am I pained by fire? why are my temples sore with the emotions of my heart?' `Because, if thou couldst not feel pain, thou couldst not feel pleasure; and without feeling, thou wouldst be consumed, piece-meal, by fire, and frost, and wounds, before thy maturity. A timely pain warns thee of excess.' `Dost thou doubt the goodness of thy Father, yet? were he not good, and kind, would he not, for he has the power and the wisdom to do it, would he not make the sun to scorch thee, like fire; the rain to fall upon thee, like hot lead; It would be done, were he to quicken thee all over with the same sensibility which shivers in thy nerves.' `Hear me!—It is my turn, now. I will speak!—Be thou, man, or devil,' said Harold. `Didst thou ever see a human being that was willing to live his life over again—exactly as he had lived it?' `No—never!' `Is not that a conclusive proof, then, that evil is the greater in human allotment?' Having said this, he buried his face in his hands.' `No—For we all hope to meet better luck hereafter, than we have met, heretofore. Few of us are willing to exchange all hope for any certainty. No man will give up all chance of greater happiness, for a much smaller sum of positive happiness. All men are gamblers. They love adventure; intrigues keep them alive.' Harold was troubled at the long silence that followed. He lifted his head; the old man had gone. But his lesson was never forgotten. Time and again did it recur to him, with a bright and convincing energy, in his subsequent temptations. Nay, it led him—it was one of the first steps, to feel and to know that God is good, and that, to be good, is to be happy. Every hour, every moment, was now developing some new power, or enlarging some old one, in the mind of Harold. That indefinite longing, which had hitherto haunted him like the perfume of some unknown flower—that he had dreamt of, and rifled somewhere, in some brief delirium; that constant and uneasy sensation—that yearning, for what, he knew not, had now began to assume a healthier and more definite character. It became ambition—virtuous ambition. The towering and eagle-fledged spirit of Dominion sat over him, in the far sky, and encouraged him. But the laurel was in her hand—not the quenched thunderbolt, smoking in blood. He fell upon his face, and worshipped. He covered his mouth with his hands, and wept; not like the Macedonian, that there were no more worlds to spoil—not like the Persian, with the imbecility of desire, when the waves foamed in thunder over his chains; but he wept, with the ungovernable anguish of an heroick nature—shut out from its element—banished from the bright sphere of its destiny—proscribed and prohibited to unfurl its pinions in the sun—imprisoned, fettered, chained by circumstances, and forbidden to expand, to dilate, and to go forth, conquering, and to conquer. The unappeasable appetite for distinction, which characterised Harold in his childhood, in his youth—that distempered longing—had now hardened and consolidated, into a sort of religious sentiment, pervading his whole heart and soul, with vitality. Loftier, and worthier designs took possession of him. Brutal force, the reputation of the warriour, he no longed courted, or coveted; nay, he derided both; but he burnt, phrenzied, with an unquenchable ardour for intellectual distinction. But how to obtain it?—how? `all things are possible,' thought Harold, to him that perseveres—to him that hath faith in himself! Is it not so? who are the great men of this earth? who have they always been? Men that have made themselves: men that have arisen from humiliation, as from the bed of death—with a new aspect!—men that have so risen, and shaken off all the attributes of mortality, and put forth their power with a godlike and uninterrupted energy. Who are the rich? not they that were born so. Who are the sceptred ones? They, whose fathers were not born so. Is it not given to man, then, to fashion his own destiny. `It is—it is!' thought Harold. `It is! and henceforth, be mine, of my own fashioning!' A new and strange confidence arose within him. He was all alone, by a mighty waterfall. The everlasting thunder of the deep, was about him. The firmament trembled—and the earth shook, as it were, with a presence—whose presence? Harold felt, and the sublime consciousness of immortality opened upon, in the darkness of this holy place, with all its dignity, and terrour, and obligation —he felt that his was that presence! and that all that he heard, and saw, was in homage to it. And why? had not God, God himself, the great and good God, fashioned him, in his own image, and given him dominion over all things, animate, and inanimate?' `I will be good!' said Harold. The words burst, like an earthquake, from his heart. He was overcome by the genius of the place. His soul brake her silence, and spoke aloud. He continued. `I will bow myself down to thee. I will yield myself to the strong impulse that agitates me. Henceforth, all that is high in my nature shall be cherished, and sublimated: all that is base, shall be returned to the earth. I yield myself up to thee. I was born, yea, I feel it, feel it in every vein, and artery, from the crown of my head, to the sole of my foot, that I was born for intellectual supremacy.' Wearied with the exhausting energy of his meditation, Harold sat, or rather leaned, against a lofty, broken, and greenly decorated rock. Its castellated appearance, the battlements at the summit, over which, the waters rushed in one sheet of light, thundering all the way, gave a sudden and fierce elevation to his thought. He clapped his hands, and shouted in the rapture of his heart. The rock trembled. The tears gushed from his eyes. He could have stood upon its summit, and wrestled with a giant! It was too much—he yielded. Reaction came back upon him. He staggered, and sunk, at the foot of the rock. How like the course of Ambition! New and calmer visions opened upon him—A more temperate nature, like that of the young bridegroom, not the gladiator. He awoke from his trance, with the feeling of consummated enjoyment—delicious, and wild, but holy, mysterious, and subduing. He slept—but in his sleep, he dreamed a dream, as he lay, deafened by the tumult, and drenched by the spray of the cataract. He heard a loud voice. He stood upon the smooth ocean. The voice came upward. All beneath his way was transparent, and flashing with ten thousand coloured, and changeable irradiations. The treasures of the whole world lay under his feet; gems, and gold, and shipwrecked thrones, were there. But, distinctly visible as they were, almost within his reach, such was the beautiful and perfect clearness of the water, he could not approach them! The ocean was like a solid diamond, with precious things bedded in its centre. He strove to plunge. In vain—he was beaten back, and stunned with the violence of the shock. `What!' he cried, in his agony—`are they all, all diadems and sceptres!—yet all inaccessible to me! will no price buy them?—not my body—my immortal soul! They are near, very near to me, and yet, oh, at what an immeasurable distance! O, that this chrystal were unlocked! that I might break asunder the glittering adamant that encrusts them, and, at once, at the peril of body and soul, rifle and spoil the boundless dominions below me!' The loud voice was uttered again. And lo! the chrystal was shattered! Harold trod, as he had desired, among the glittering fragments of armour, and thrones, and jewels, and diadems, and light. What were they all? DUST AND ASHES!—the very dust—the very dust of which the vilest things are compounded! A flaming jewel lay before him. He touched it. It crumbled, and grew dark. Another!—it dissolved while he held it, like the ice that departs in a vapour! `It is a dream! all, all a dream,' thought Harold, even in his sleep: and he struggled to awake. A sudden change followed. He was among a multitude. All eyes were upon him. All hands were extended toward him. He was suddenly filled with inspiration and musick. He spoke—his language was mighty —it flowed, and flowed forever, without effort or diminution. The multitude were agitated, like his own limbs. He felt himself rising from the earth! His voice became more and more sounding. He rose, and the multitude arose with him. The blue sky opened, and he entered, arm and arm, with them that he had loved upon the earth—The spirit of Elvira passed him! She was dead—She touched his heart with her rotten finers! He screamed! and awoke. The echo of his scream came back to him from the skies, with such horrible clearness—so loud—so appalling, that the very hair of his head stood up with affright. He fled. It was long before he had the spirit to recall the transactions of his dream. When he did, it was with high encouragement. It appeared to him, a type of the intellectual dominion, which he was one day to hold over his fellow men. `Let me go, and be great! But where shall I go,' cried he, mournfully, `who will take the young Indian by the hand, and bless him, and encourage him, and love him?—love him! oh, who will ever love him again? him! the destroyer! A wild cry broke from his shivering, pale lips. The thought was distraction. `I will go, I will go,' he cried, the impetuosity of his nature breaking out into quick, inarticulate sounds—`I will fly, fly to the uttermost ends of the earth. Woman as she is, great as she is, injured as she is, I will make myself worthy of her. She shall forgive me, bless me, love me. Love me!' he shuddered. Her love! oh, no! it was not for him. And yet, there was that blue eye, wrapped in its shiny, wet lashes—that trembling, red lip—the deep, distant musick of her voice—the reluctant yielding of her hand, and the tremulous clinging of her very drapery to him, as he stole upon her slumbers, and felt the loud pulsation of her heart!—all these were in his ears, and his eyes yet, just as, upon her pillow, `She turned, and lay, Her dark eyes flashing through their tears, Like skies that rain, and lighten!' And now—what devil raised her spirit to rebuke him, for his unholy revenge!—now, the image of Loena awoke in his heart. He trembled like a guilty VOL. I. R thing. He dared not touch her extended hand. He had no voice. His heart felt sick. He remembered her. There she was! there, before him, in the shadow of that cavern; her full orbs rivetted upon his, just as when they parted last, with that passionate tenderness—dark eyes doating upon diamonds, every beam and spark reflected deeply within them— treasured and emitted only in love! yes! there they were, with his own dark and fiery image burning in their very centre—just where his spirit first encountered hers!—at home—in her own melancholy and beautiful eyes! `I must, I will see her!' cried Harold, unable to endure the chiding of her apparition. She was now journeying with a tribe towards the remote Spanish possessions, and he knew not but that he might have to pursue her even to Mexico. But he resolved to begin that very hour. It was midnight, the very depth of a starry midnight, when he departed. He stood upon the hills. The home of his childhood was now abandoned forever. The stars, from their blue thrones, looked pleasantly down upon him. The whole earth, with its covering of dewy leaves, sparkled back the effulgence of Heaven, and he trod, like a celestial, for awhile, in a luminous atmosphere, between heaven and earth!—all was so noiseless! so holy! so miraculous! A far shadowing skirt of darkness went round about the horizon. Over that he was to pass. A tumultuous piling of the deepest blue cloud, like a range of battlements, with stars gleaming, like watch lights through their loop-holes, were on yonder side of the great sky. Through them he is to penetrate. Here he begins his pilgrimage—here! a little lower than the angels—in the windy musick of a midnight water, flowing on, flowing on, through all eternity, to its solitary place, the deep ocean—by a smooth and beautiful stream—by the side of this, is he to begin his wandering. He turns toward the home of his childhood. He invokes the Great Spirit of the place. He descends to the nearest running water. He kneels, scoops up a handful, and throws it over his head; an awful rite that, on a departure like this, was not to be omitted. He listens for the expected answer. He hears, or fancies that he hears, a shrill cry in the firmament. His blood runs cold. He gazes all over the heavens. Not a cloud— not a shadow—not the shadow of a shade is to be seen. He leaps backward! Something has passed him—he is chilled to the heart—and see! the top of yonder blasted pine bends for a moment, as with the weight of something that alights from heaven. And yet, nothing is to be seen—nothing!—was it in homage to some passing creature of the elements? or did it stoop with the weight of some descending shadow? Whatever might be the cause, Harold's heart felt cold and heavy, and he could not stir from the spot. How was he to interpret such omens? were they accidental? were they common?—at all times—and only heard and seen now, because his senses, under his intense expectation, have became more tremblingly vigilant? He recovers, and pursues his way, oppressed, in spite of himself, with lonely and melancholy apprehensions— the saddest sadness of a young heart, going, for the first time, into its solitary exile; seeing, in anticipation, all its future life shadowed and stained by vicissitude and misfortune, and wondering if any eyes will weep at his departure, or brighten at his return. Are these feelings to be wondered at? Who does not dread to be forgotten! What is all the business of life, even of the most insignificant, but a struggle to be remembered. Who that parts with another, even when that other may be indifferent to him, can patiently endure the thought of being utterly forgotten? who can endure it? But then, when we love, and are beloved, how dreadfully disheartening is the belief, the knowledge, for it is knowledge, that no matter how madly we are loved, doated on—that we, in our turn, shall be forgotten, forever, and forever! and that the places which now know us shall know us no more. I speak not of death, though death, itself, with all its foolish terrour and pomp, is but the being forgotten—but absence, absence, alone! A short interruption to endearment changes the heart of the faithfulest and tenderest—yea, even the heart of woman. And he who has been loved to delirium—to death—in his desolation; who has been clung to by his beloved one, as though life, and heaven, and blood and pulse, were all within his touch and presence—even he—he! will soon be forgotten, or remembered only, with a sudden and brief contraction of the heart, as we remember those whom we have loved, and wronged—and find no justification for no longer loving. Oh, God! what is the love of woman! Harold, himself, yea, Harold, the young and impetuous boy—his heart a fountain of high hopes, even he, he had learned that the desolation of woman, the youngest and loveliest, the most impassioned of women, was soon to be comforted! He had left her, and they knelt together. He had embraced her again and again—kissed her forehead, and her eyes—pressed the very blood from her lips, in the agony of his delight and terrour! blessed her! wept upon her bosom! bathed her cheeks, her lips, and her very hands with his tears!—felt her tremble with the pulsation of unutterable love, from head to foot, as he held her in his arms—heard her quick, humid, and fainting respiration, while her inarticulate murmuring betrayed her nature, in her pure, but passionate embrace. O, the luxury of such communion! the dear, delicious melancholy of such parting remembrances! And yet—Harold had been forgotten! So he believed. Tell me, ye, who have known what it is to press for the first time, the half-yielding and trembling lip of your dear one; ye, who have felt the gentle, reluctant, heaving of her beautiful bosom, as its undulations gradually gave way to your engrossing embrace—the faint, involuntary pressure of her hand—know ye of aught worth living for, afterward? Recall it—dwell on it— that thrilling affinity, the moment when it was first acknowledged! that monopoly of the heart, when it expanded, and enfolded all that was precious on earth. And yet—yet!—there is a moment, one moment, more unspeakably dear and tender—more unutterably holy to the remembrance;—it is that moment when you tear away your pulse from her pulse, your heart from her heart, after they have grown together—when your presence breaks away from her locked arms, like the parting of soul and body, in a mortal sweat and terrour— when, for one moment, all reserve is forgotten!—all!— ye know that ye may never meet again, and ye lie heart to heart, for the first, and the last time!—against each others bosoms:—and then—then—oh, the widowhood that follows!—when you turn, in your dreaming, your heart gushing out with warmth and tenderness, to pour consolation anew into the bosom of her you love— you turn, in your sleep—outreach your desolate arms to embrace her, once more, and awake!—awake, with your lifeless hands upon the untenanted pillow! And then—the coldness—the intolerable, the bleak, unutterable loneliness that follows! Death! death is happiness to it—winter hath no chilliness like it. So had Harold parted. So had he dreamed; and often, in his boyhood, had he awoke with the cold sweat standing upon his lips, and his forehead reeking with fever. Thus had he parted from Loena. It was like the dividing asunder of one heart. A little season, and lo! there was an immeasurable separation between them. The longing, quivering palpitation of each riven and sore part, for reunion, had ceased. And soon, another, a warrior, stern and inexorable, even the unconquerable Logan, himself!—He had supplanted the boy, Harold. Yes, he! he whom Harold had heard her execrate, with a bitterness and sincerity, that made his blood curdle, had trodden upon the steps of Harold, in the heart of his dear, dark-eyed girl, and obliterated them forever! What faith could he have in woman, afterward? Did he love? Go look at his forehead. Study his dim and sunken eye—watch the throbbing of his pale, hollow temples—his pallid cheek—his wasted form, transparent with thought—then tell me if ever man loved woman, as Harold loved Loena. What gave him that unquiet look? that fierce spirit? that preternatural activity? that fearful, that appalling regardlessness of danger? Know ye the operation of love? such love, on a temperament like his? It is purification. It is death. It is an untiring, destroying impulse. It is a drug, so potent, that it exhilarates to madness. It is a drunkenness of the heart, so enervating, so wasting, R 2 as to leave him, upon whom it hath wrought, in the torpor and inebriety of death. His life issues at his pores, with the tinge of blood, under the pressure of the atmosphere, while the enchantment is upon him. Who that loves in his boyhood, loves not—if he survive—in his prime? But loves he always her that he loved first? Whence the mysterious transfer of his affection? whence the power with which man invests his last idol with all the properties, of all others, that had ever haunted him before? It is from love. Know ye the secret? The man is often another being than the boy. But the heart, having once learned to love, will love on—or famish and wither. Love is its only aliment; that once tasted, it rejects all other. Opportunity, peril, adventure, and toil, and calamity, may fit and prepare man for a more durable passion. But retirement, melancholy, youth and innocence are enough to warm the natural offspring of young hearts, into life, and beauty. The bird will soar, spring it whence it may—but the prouder the heart, the higher the elevation, whence it takes its departure, the higher will be its flight, till its plumes are quenched only in the heaven of heavens; till falcon-like, it cleave the furthest cloud of the furthest sky. The heart of man changes. Hence follows the sundering of loved ones. She whom he sought for a companion in his boyhood, becomes less and less his companion, as he soars higher and higher: and lo, as he touches the confines of his natural dominion, he looks about, and she has departed. Her wings and spirit have failed. He is alone—alone, in the blue depth of heaven. Then he seeks one of loftier bearing, stronger pinions, one that can hold everlasting companionship with his flight, and everlasting equality with him. So stood it with Harold. Behold him now upon the hills. The morning sun pours his unchannelled light over the highest barriers of earth. Over them, it rolls down like a flood, upon the agitated and boundless vapour below. The cloud beneath his feet heaves like illuminated drapery—like an ocean of changeable silk. The tree tops, here and there, break through, and gleam in the red sunshine, above the ocean of shadow, like evergreens with golden branches, and fire-tipped leaves: brilliant, sun-coloured, branching coral, afloat upon water, growing through the smooth surface—look! a wilderness of flowery gold, washed up by the ocean, is before thee! and see! the bare rocks put up their waving, sharp points, like so many beacon-flames, into the sky. Further and further, rolls up the curtain of the air. The water brightens. Glimpses of the earth, like a floating ærial greenness, are, here and there, caught through the thin vapour. So, and with similar gradations, cleared away the thought of young Harold. The early breeze came sounding in his ear, and his heart awoke like a new strung harp, when first visited by the loud wind, from the high places. His veins swelled. He saw the bright sun dancing away below him, in the deepest part of the blue water; and he was, in the very levity of his spirit, ready to descend, and strip, and plunge, and riot as deeply, in the beautiful element. A great bird passed him, with a continual shriek; perhaps the very bird that had appalled him in the night time, by her cry. Now, he stood on tip-toe, and lifted up his hands in astonishment, as she sailed by, utterly regardless of the being, to whom God had given dominion over her. Where was that dominion? what mockery! She derided him. Away she swept! away! like a ship of air, laden with majesty, and shining in the prodigal light of the sun, like something chosen and familiar with his hottest magnificence—his most secret abiding places. On she went, on! directly in her course, as toward some outlet of heaven. She departed. Harold saw her, like a shining motion, to the last moment. He knew that she had gone, and yet, for a whole hour afterward, whenever he turned his eyes suddenly upward, there was that bird!—there!—constantly before him—constantly ascending; swaying her mighty pinions all the while, and bearing away for her anchorage among the stars, while he—he! was rooted to the spot! What changeable creatures we are! Harold grew discontented, melancholy, with the thought. He, who had begun, with a feeling of rapturous enjoyment, to thank his God, that he could travel with this majestick creature, almost within her own haunted dominion, far above the evolving clouds, now saddened with the thought that there had not been given to him; wings with which to accompany her. He started from his revery. The trees nodded as he passed, but it was light, now, and he scarcely observed them. They were the dwarfish vegetation of another world, and he was pleased with the motion of their tops—the same motion, that, the last night, in darkness, had chilled him with horrour! Such is human nature! all things in heaven and earth are stained and dimmed with our prevailing humour; with a light heart, man showers the light, as from a reservoir, upon all the world: with a cloudy one he rolls, continually out, as from an unfathomable abyss, his shadow, and spectres, till all without is gloomy and repulsive, as the sepulcre of his own heart. A whole week had passed, since his journeying. But still he pursued his route, maturing in the brisk mountain air, all his plans of future discipline, and glory. He was startled by a shot, and twenty or thirty quick reverberations over his head, as if a platoon had fired a feu de joie. The next moment, he saw a wild animal spring down from the point of a projecting rock, with that peculiarity of desperation, the ferocious and expiring energy of rage, which characterises the wounded, and often the mortally wounded, wild beast, of the cat family. A furious dog followed—bloody and torn, but yelling upon his prey. Another shot followed—a shriek! `Almighty God!' cried Harold, and he leaped down the near channel, and disappeared. Shot after shot, rang from the precipice, above, and rattled among the trees, and the thin smoke twined beautifully over his head. He caught a sight of the animal, with the shaggy dog at her heels, scrambling up the precipice. She toils— yells—and with a desperate spring, seats herself, at last, upon a rock, beyond the reach of the dog; her eyes dilated, snapping, and red as blood—her back bristling —and her hot blood rattling upon the rock. She throws herself suddenly upon her back! The next moment, another dog is seen breaking headlong down the precipice. He springs at her throat. She strikes him but once, with her claw, and he rolls over the rock—embowelled!—a mass of blood and intestines, upon his companion, beneath. Harold stands, with wonder and affright, and gazes upon the terrible creature. He raises his rifle, reluctantly; levels, snaps—the animal hears him—it misses fire! She rears upon her hind legs, and gnashes her teeth. Aware of the consequences, Harold throws aside his rifle, and leaps down the precipice. The desperate creature follows—the branches crackle as she falls through them, from her blinding elevation. She reaches the earth. She shivers with rage, and prepares to throw herself upon Harold, who is lying almost insensible, at a few paces distance. He shuts his eyes. Another shot!—and a dog jumps at her throat. It is all over with the brave creature; and her heart appears to burst, just as a young Indian girl breaks through the tangled, and flowery underwood, and— `Gracious heaven!' cried the delirious Harold. The Indian girl shrieked—ran to him, plucked away his hands from his face, and threw herself upon him— sobbing, and chafing his forehead. He awoke. `O! what art thou! whence, whence, thou blessed girl?' he cried. He caught her hands—he plucked her down upon his bosom, in an agony of suffocation: he pressed her again and again, to his troubled and whirling heart. The hunters gathered round in dismay, at the perilous escape of the stranger, and wondering at the passionate forgetfulness of a chaste Indian maid. She arose from his bosom, arose upon her feet, with an air of princely authority. At this instant, the expiring animal, recovered for a moment, and with, a giddy, reeling motion, threw herself toward Harold. Her paw only reached him, but his ribs were laid bare. It remained there. It was severed from her body, and a long knife was driven again and again through her heart, by the hunters. The blood of Harold, and the beast mingled and frothed together, and smoked, as in mortal strife, yet. The Indian girl sank, with her eyes swimming, and her mouth trembling, by his side. The huntsmen stood around. Harold was recognised, and men who had never wept before, wept now, at the spectacle of blood, and youth and beauty before them. Here were two young Indians, fashioned in the choicest mould of beauty, filled with fire and passion—lovers, long, long, asunder—loving to desperation—dying insensibly upon each others' bosoms—at the moment of meeting, in the deep solitude, the awful wilderness. They were deceived. Neither was dying. Harold recovered first. He was deluged with blood, the blood of her that he had loved—had loved! yea, loved yet, to distraction. He clung to her, and kissed her, and wept upon her, and staunched her deep wound, with his own mouth; while the Indians, whose presence of mind never deserted them, ran seeking some well-known and powerful herb. It was found, and applied, as a potent, and infallible styptick. A litter of green and flowery underwood, interlaced with vine tendons, was soon woven, and the lovers were borne side by side in each other's arms, with a mournful and uninterrupted silence, to the hunting encampment. A fire was made, and some food, such as the Indian is never without, of parched corn, and sun-dried venison, was prepared, and they were induced, notwithstanding their exhausted state, to partake. Loena lay upon Harold's arm. An old Indian stood contemplating them. His regard for Loena, was the devout, awful veneration of a great heart swayed by superstition. She was the last of the Logans, directly descended from the Mingo chief, and was believed to be the legitimate inheritor of his terrible powers. This veneration, Loena herself, had learned to consider as her right; and she would have been more amazed, had one of the tribe denied her the homage that men pay, not merely to rank and loveliness, and high birth, but to preternatural attributes, than if he had fallen down upon his face, and worshipped her. Her deportment and tread were queen-like, prompt, and resolute. Her movement was lofty, and determined, like one that knew and felt that she was born to command. `Loena!' said Harold, in a faint whisper, as if to assure himself that it was she, whose warm breath he felt upon his heart, as her face was hidden in his bosom, and her hurried palpitations told him that she was not sleeping, however she might pretend to be—`Loena, love!' The answer was a slight, doubtful, tremulous movement of her soft hand. His mouth sought hers; their lips touched, and thrilled—and once more, once more, they breathed their souls into each other, while the tears streamed from their eyes, and the blood of their hearts mingled. `Dear, dear Harold!—Dear Loena!' was all that either could articulate for minutes. They became more composed. Harold felt something warm trickling down his side. It was her blood. Harold recollected the wound, the occasion, and his heart shivered in its socket. Another thought; it lightened through his very heart. His brain withered. There was a choaking taste of dust and ashes, and bitterness in his mouth. `My God! my God!' he cried, clinging to her—`I cannot lose thee, now! O, no, I cannot, cannot! and yet, O, Loena!' A soft kiss upon his eye-lids reassured him. He arose upon his elbow, and tenderly urged the inquiry with his hand, while she gradually yielded to it. He felt for the wound, with trembling, and terrour. His joy, his rapture, may be imagined, when he found her bosom unscarred, untorn—that the wound in her neck was slight, and that in her side, whence the blood had fallen upon him, like rain, was rather deep, than dangerous, and was completely staunched. The profusion of clotted gore had terrified him beyond expression, but now he was tranquil, happy, in a measure. New thoughts came to him. She leaned upon his bosom: his right arm was under her neck, and her two hands were locked in his, and held to his heart. She felt his, slowly relax. One of hers fell. Where now was his anxious fondness? Why did he not seek it, and replace it with the accustomed kiss? Woman, to the core of her heart! Loena coldly withdrew the other, and finding no opposition to the movement, while she knew from his breathing that Harold was not asleep, she raised her head, with a feeling of resentment and surprise, which she could not, and would not suppress, from his shoulder, and lay, silent, breathless, and far from him. A long silence followed. Harold's breath rattled in his throat. The couch trembled. Was he choking? Poor Loena, in the sudden terrour of the thought, was on the point of returuing to his bosom, more warmly than ever, when Harold put out his hands, and articulated, with a convulsive, and gasping indistinctness, `Logan!' Had a flash of lightning struck, and burnt, and blinded her, at her prayers, she could not have been more amazed. To be repulsed, and so rudely, at such a moment! O, it was as if her brain had contracted with a sudden spasm. She felt—how it would be difficult to tell—it was, as if one half of her own heart were dead, struck with the palsy. She stared wildly at him, and clasped her forehead, and Harold gazed at her, without speech or motion. `Logan!' she uttered, at last, with a tremulous tone, hiding her face, while the tears gushed through her fingers. The voice, the action that accompanied it, was death, nay, worse, ten thousand times worse, than any death, to Harold. It was a confirmation of all his fears—all! She loved Logan, and who was Logan? His own father! He arose. `Farewell!' said he, just laying his hand coldly upon her arm, `farewell!' No answer was returned. A low, suppressed, breathing, and somewhat— could it be?—like sobbing, seemed to be near him. His heart was touched, but his temper grew more decisive, and firm, and severe. `Farewell!' he cried—`Loena, farewell, forever! we never meet again.' No answer, no emotion. Was he disappointed? Aye, he was. But why leave her, if she cared so little for him? It would be no punishment to her. Why be so shaken, himself, if she retained such amazing self-command? His spirit awoke in anger, and rebuked him. Her stillness continued. Was it natural? He feared not. Should he inquire? His pride might have prevented him, much as he loved her, (for at such a moment pride is equal to love, exactly and love is neutralized by the commixture) had he not heard a trickling upon the dry leaves, which covered the cabin floor. Horrour! Harold leaped to her side, and caught her in his arms. She was insensible. She had fainted with the loss of blood. The bandage—she had loosened it silently, and secretly, and, perhaps, it was already too late! O! how he cursed himself, and shrieked, and cursed himself again. A word, one single unkind word had fallen from his lips, and his beloved had answered not, moved not, but silently prepared herself to bleed to death! How full of womanhood!—the pure divinity of woman!—uncomplaining, patient, meek, silent and dying! His cries soon brought assistance, and the expiring Loena was removed to a couch of skins. That which she had left was drenched and dropping with her dear blood. And poor Harold stood, like a condemned spirit, some erring creature, under the ban of the most High, awaiting his final judgment. He dwelt upon her mild, full, melancholy eyes, half-shut in the languor of death, but gleaming yet, like dark jewelry through net work; her most beautiful hair, saturate with blood—as would a murderer dwell upon his innocent victim, in the first waking of his tranced spirit, when every passion but that of pity, was extinct, and the horrour of his comsummate guilt was ascending, slowly, like cold adders, to his brain. She opened her dying eyes. She fixed them sadly, but haughtily upon Harold. He could not endure it. Such a look from Loena was his death-warrant. He almost leaped upward, and denounced himself as her murderer, before God Her countenance changed not. He fell upon his knees—he caught her hands, and watered them with his tears. All in vain. She was inexorable. She had been doubted: she saw that—it was for the first time, and the last: and doubted too, at such a moment!—what woman could forgive it—innocent, or guilty?—none! VOL. I. S She waved him off. He arose, sternly, but refused to go. She waved her hand again, impatiently; and her Indian attendants plucked him away by main force. Not one look, not one motion, from her, to prevent the indignity. Could it be? Had he not loved her? kissed her, and she, him—held her to his heart time, and again? Had she not answered, pulse for pulse, to his longing and delight? Where now, was her tenderness? Were all these things forgotten so soon? These, that should have survived the mortal agony, the dissolution of death—these, that should have burnt forever, a ray of pure divinity, amid the festering corruption of the whole body and soul! `O, woman! woman!' cried Harold. The sweat stood upon his forehead, in the strife of pride, and tenderness, and humiliation—and he! what right had he to doubt? Where was his constancy? where were his purity and faith? He would have given the whole world, for never, never had he so passionately desired it before; Such is man—he would have given the whole world just to feel her once more, the proud creature, clinging to him, and trembling from head to foot, that he might, if he could, cast her off, forever, and triumph in his turn. Never had he been so humbled, so indignant. He resisted no longer. `Brothers,' he said, to the Indians that held him, `release me.' His tone was of authority. It was not to be disobeyed. He stood erect, and then, carelessly strode out into the open air. He went as some majestick creature, moving, and sustained only, by volition, without physical action, irresistible and silent; and well that he did go thus, for he so rose in his turn, in the heart of the dying girl, that, for a single moment she raised her hands in admiration. Harold saw the shadow thereof upon the wall, and his heart leaped within him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XII. `Far over the plain, away went the bridleless steed! With the dew of the morning, his feltocks were wet; And the foam frothed his limbs in the journey of noon; Nor stayed he, till, over the westerly heaven, The shadows of evening had set. `—Let me be A sharer in thy fierce and far delight; A portion of the tempest!—and of thee! `And now 'twas done! in the lone wood were plighted Their hearts; the stars, their nuptial torches, shed Beauty upon the beautiful, they lighted, — Their priest was solitude—and they were wed— And they were happy!'— A horse stood foaming and pawing the earth, by the precipitous and broken approach to the encampment. Over his smoking flanks, trailed the reeking skin of a new slain panther. He snorted and stamped impatiently, and the blood arose in a hot steam from his chest. A horse was an uncommon spectacle in these solitudes. Many and many a prize, however, had been wrenched from the white settlers of the north: and multitudes were to be had, in their native, untamed, unbroken fierceness and glory, in the further savannahs of the south and west. But this creature was a phenomenon. He stood instinct with spirit. Through his thin, glossy coat, the ridgy veins ran and intertwined in his action, with the movement of life—from head to foot, the animal was pulse, all pulse! Who does not feel his heart grow big at the sight of these warlike creatures? Who can see the free carriage of a young stallion, flinging his iron bound hoofs on the air, swaying his wide mane, hither and thither, with the arch of his neck—his broad chest rattling with his loud breath, all the while, and not feel as if he could vault into the saddle, upon the spot, and tilt against the whole world; and yet, how little you know of fine horses in civilized life. Go to the wilderness—the broad river—the boundless, immeasurable savannah, and desert, when the ceiling of heaven shines like dark blue chrystal above you—a transparent, moveable dome, embossed, and dropped-with molten gold! Look at them, then—war horses going continually, in a whirlwind of smoke and dust, about the whole circumference of their dominions. Whole troops—thousands and tens of thousands, thundering round, from horizon to horizon, as with the incessant charging of continual battle. They who have never seen these things, will never believe them. To see an army of young horses coming down from a distant elevation, like a dark cloud; or emerging from the extremest bound of the earth, for so it seems to the traveller upon one of these unbroken plains, like an army with banners; and sweeping onward, with the noise and effect of a tornado—the earth quaking under them, neighing, and leaping; their eyes flashing fire, and their manes and tails streaming like banners in the blast—to see this, is worth travelling, as I have travelled, from the east unto the west, and from the north, even unto the ends of the earth. So stood this horse, hot and smoking with fatigue, the foam rolled up over his chest, and spotting his beautiful limbs, as if he had swum against a mill race; so, he stood, lashing his sides ever and anon, with his sweeping tail, like a young lion. The blood was dropping yet from the raw skin, and the fiery animal snuffed it, with an expression of ferocious and vivid delight—uncovering his white teeth, and displaying his transparent red nostrils, as he drew in the vapour, with the loud wind, and sent it forth again like steam, as if the whole world were a level, and all his own! Is there a creature beneath the sky, man only excepted, so lofty, so terrible, so truly august and beautiful, as him, whose neck is flaked with thunder—the young war horse! Never shall I forget a spectacle to which I was a witness, once, in South America. I was encompassed by four Guerillas, each having two led horses, one unincumbered, and one loaded with provisions. We had been often apprised of the danger to be apprehended from encountering a herd of wild horses; and were continually on the look-out, particularly, as but a few weeks before, an account had come among us, of the total extinction of a small cavalcade, small, but larger than ours, nevertheless, which was literally trampled to dust, by a charge from one of these irresistible hordes. Never shall I forget the day. Our advanced guide arose, for a moment, in his stirrups, or rather upon his feet, for he leaped upon the saddle; then, instantly threw off the rein, with which he led the spare horse, sprang upon his back, abandoning his spent and goaded creature, and set off at full gallop. The other guerillas followed without speaking a word, in the deepest silence and consternation; and, I, without knowing the reason, followed them with similar feelings of dismay, leaving our laden, and helpless horses behind. They were four in number. The mystery was soon revealed. My blood went `a rippling to my finger-ends.' I felt my heart dissolving, as if some impure thing had touched and tainted it: never before had I felt such a mortal terrour, and there was, through all my vitals, after the first sudden electrick chill, a feeling of general thaw and dissolution. I had tried, in vain, to overtake my flying companions, and learn the cause of their terrour; and was checking my horse in despair, when I saw a black cloud hovering low upon the horizon; it concentrated, it appeared upon the earth; it took a yet closer shape, and approached, with the noise of a hurricane, and the appearance of broken and trampled grass, swept up by a strong wind, and whirled about in the air. The truth broke upon me at once, and I determined to await the event with fortitude, losing all sense of personal danger, in my astonishment and delight, at the awful reverberation of their trampling hoofs. They came, like a whole army of cavalry, battalion after battalion, shod in iron, and dashing over a solid pavement, laden with armour, the bullets rained upon their mailed breasts, as they rained the other day upon the French cuirassiers at Waterloo, when all England shook with terrour. My god! my god! I shouted! for, in an instant, three of our laden horses, that were yet in sight, were trodden upon by the whole army, till they were not to be distinguished from the S 2 black earth with which their entrails were mingled, and compounded. One only escaped. They wheeled. They came round altogether, in array; two or three stragglers only appearing to diverge for a moment, as if undetermined whether to thunder me down, in the same manner, or to pursue my companions, who were scouring away before me, with a celerity that made me smile, even in my terrour. They determined, after a moment's irresolution, upon the latter; and all wheeled together, with one universal neigh, and set off after them. I heard a noise at my left. It was the remaining horse; he put himself in a gallop towards me, relaxed, stopped, faltered, shook, and fell within pistol shot, actually overcome by his fright. I rode to the poor creature: he was trembling and convulsed, and covered with sweat. You would have thought that he had just broke away, with his torn mane, from the paws of a lion. I had seen such things in Asia. But what s situation was mine! Alone, in a boundless savannah, my guides trampled to death—no path—no compass—no chart—no experience—and left to find my way, for a thousand miles, perhaps, with one horse, and the few provisions that he could carry. Their fate I considered inevitable. Every moment, this frightful cavalcade was audibly gaining upon them; and their wild, delirious neighing was like the noise of ten thousand trumpets. Suddenly, they appeared to be motionless—to concentrate—the sound of their charge was suspended—the body grew darker, and larger. `Gracious heaven!' I cried, rising in my stirrups, they are returning! My heart died within me. My horse shook under me. My love of life became desperately strong. I threw myself from the saddle, willing to try one experiment, by diverting their attention from me to my horse. I struck him a smart blow, and instantly concealed myself in the thick grass. He set off at his utmost speed, in the very direction that I wished. What a spectacle! This most beautiful and spirited animal, flying, with his mane all loose, every sinew strained to cracking, over his native plain, before a horde of his early companions, with a mortal fear and trepidation, more like reason, than instinct. The herd were motionless. Were they deliberating? It began to thunder. In this situation, I stood, trembling with awe and sublimity, and yet, thrilling to my very heart, with inconceivably wild and hurrying sensations of delight. For whole hours, I had heard it thundering, from one dark spot in the skies, while all the rest was serene as a summer lake. It was so now. All was so pure, so spiritually pure above, that the sky seemed further from earth than ever. And far below it, as if suspended in the air, revolved a heavy mass of cloud, black as death in the centre, the edges of undulating and fiery crimson. Above and below, and on every side, shot out incessant flashes of pale, silvery light, with intermittant blue vapour, like hair combed thin, and blowing about in a high wind; and ever and anon bright sparkles were emitted, and steely coloured darts, hurled, whistling, into the blue vacuity—lances encountered, and shivering. All about, was the most soft and delicious blue, that mortal eye ever beheld. Through this, with a quivering, and incessant vivacity, a pale, streaming, threaded lustre, as if the shuttles of heaven, were at work, shot hither and thither, leaving lines of bright crimson, and rough gold, like net work, for a moment, over the blue. The colours were perpetually changing. Now, there ran along the sides and bottom of the cloud, a border of flame-coloured tasselling, and broad fringe. Anon, a narrow rippling of scarlet and white fire, like blood and lava, so intensely bright, that for hours afterward, the same ribband-like lustre was quivering before me, let me look where I would. It thundered:—from the bosom of the black rolling cloud, there came a tremendous uproar, as of the onset and shock of successive armies. This sound diminished: but an uninterrupted noise, as of thunder and musick, battle, and martial minstrelsy, continued, without a moment's intermission, until midnight, accompanied at times, with a general discharge, as of coloured fire-works, from the whole circumference of the cloud—hail and rain of crimson and gold.—Where was I? How felt I? I cannot describe it. I was not aware of the terrour and distress, and rapture that I had felt, till I found myself, with my knees knocking together, quivering in all my limbs, and my clothing literally drenched with sweat. But to this circumstance, alone, the thundering in the sky, I found afterwards, that I had to attribute not only my own safety, but that of my companions. Never shall I forget it! never! Often have I been in battle; full often have I seen a charger `burst his bloody girth,' and sweep the slippery ground with his broad mane, as he lifted his neck, and staggered upon his knees, for the last time, so that the blood came in a shower, like rain, upon the rank behind him, while the living fire streamed from his swollen eye-balls, his hair bristled all over with spirit and vitality, and his long fetlocks were matted and stiffened with hot gore. And once I remember; nay, I never can forget it—seeing a great white horse, in the thick of battle, the smoke of a whole park of artillery was rolling about him; a standard rattled before him in the sky; twenty bayonets were in his side at once, yet he leaped on and on, and through and through, the squadron before him; and was literally lifted from the earth, by the planted pikes upon which he finally leaped; pitching his gallant rider upon the bayonets beyond, which hedged in the blazing standard—the rent and smoking spoil, at which he drove, when he too was impaled in the air! and unhorsing, with the shock of thunder, an opposing captain, and then, lo! I can see him yet! staggering to the earth, and dragging down, horse and horseman, banner and shield; his whole body red with his own wounds; his magnificent harness trailing in blood; his saddle turned—his trappings torn and tangled; his great heart rattling in his chest; a reddish vapour rising from his encrusted, and fractured limbs, like a hot steam. Yes! yes! I do see him at this moment—His sinews writhing and knotting, his mane flashing, his nostrils dilating, and running crimson, and the blood starting with his last neigh, through every pore of his skin, as from some animal, in a suddenly exhausted receiver. Yes, this have I seen! and that, the spectacle just described, an army of young stallions thundering down from the sky, with the noise and the smoke of the hurricane, all in ranks—their eyes, even at the distance of a mile, visible, like the glancing of armour points in the sun, by a continual and angry glitter: yet never have I seen a creature that agitated me like the description which I have heard from an Indian, who remembered this horse, which now stood, with loose rein, floating, before the tent. Harold paused, with a feeling of breathless astonishment, to gaze upon the noble animal—Surely! could it be possible? His own colt!—`Hurra!'—he leaped upon his back; the animal reared and neighed, as if instantly recognizing the accomplished horseman, by his firm seat; who could have resisted the temptation? Harold never stopped to consider whose property the creature now was; enough for him that it had been his, and that he had been wrongfully despoiled of it. One rein was knotted to a sapling. Harold had not, it was impossible that he could have, the patience to untie it. He drew his hanger, and severed it with a blow; turned his proud head up the mountain; and the next moment, was leaping upon its very summit, panting, and breathless. So steep was the ascent, that his chin rested upon the head of his horse. He stood up in his stirrups, and looked about him. The world lay all below him. There was the cabin, there! He could almost spring upon its roof. There too, was she whom he had loved; he raised his hand to his eyes, and sunk into the saddle. Had he seen her? could it be—for the last time? How strange the sensation! Once he had believed that his passionate heart could not find a home away from hers—that, alone, it would shiver itself to death in his bosom. Now! his lip quivered, and he wondered what withheld him, from leaping, horse and rider, down upon the tent that enshrined her. `Did she love him? did she!' he asked himself, over and over again. His vestment parted with the vehement pulsation of his heart. It grew audible. He was startled at the sound. The sun flamed behind him. He blushed, as he looked upon his own magnificent shadow—upon a broad, flat rock, opposite, his horse pawing and reaching, under him, tossing his head continually, and waving his shadowy mane—`his bits wrangling,' and he, with his head uncovered—half-naked—his panther skin floating away from his shoulders—`O, if she were near me now,' thought Harold. The thought had not passed his lips, when he heard a shout, a call, away below him. It was instantly answered on all sides. He heard his name—menaces, curses, and exclamations, followed. What could it mean? If ill, he was too conspicuous. He turned to depart, but he was too late, the noise of his trampling charger upon the solid rock, betrayed him. He was seen. The shout was renewed. It was not like the cheering of friendship or encouragement, but rather like that which precedes the immolation of some victim. `Surely, I might have expected this,' thought Harold. I have wronged their mistress, their princess, their priestess. Who of them all, much as I know they have loved me, will spare me? Harold wondered at his own blindness and infatuation. A new sense of life had returned to him, and he shuddered at the danger that he had escaped. Weak, and wounded as he was, his weakness and wounds were all forgotten, now. In the hour of trial, many are the hearts that fail not; but who can look upon the battle, or the shipwreck, or the combat of wild beasts, from which he has escaped, and not feel his blood run cold? Every shot, every cry rings through his heart, and every shattered plank strikes him, as it drives to the shore, with a sense of his own worthlessness and insensibility. I have known men faint at the recollection of what they have faced, without trembling. And I, myself, at this moment, dare not trust my cowardly spirit, in looking back upon what I have often hazarded in mere wantonness. It throws my very heart into a sweat. I can feel the blood hiding in my vitals, my brain shivering; and yet, place me again, again, where no mortal help can aid me: toe to toe with the same peril, and no change, other than a more deadly paleness, would betray my emotion. I should not shrink. I should not shut my eyes. I should do the same deeds again, with firmness, with a steady voice, a steady eye; and mayhap, go home, and hide my face in my bed, and weep, with gratitude for my escape. Such is man! So with Harold. The present danger was nothing. The past, all. Now, he remembered, and he wondered that he had not before suspected their evil purposes; that the Indians below, had greeted him, after his interview with Loena, in sullenness. Now, he remembered, and his blood boiled at the thought, how roughly they had dragged him, upon his knees, from her presence. Why did he not smite them to the earth? why? He had half a mind to ride down upon them, now, from the very top of the mountain, and avenge the indignity, on horseback, and in her very presence! Was his countenance troubled? Yea. When the deep places of Harold's heart were troubled, he showed it. Disturb the bottom of the deepest ocean, itself, and bubbles will arise—a somewhat, more fearful and appalling, will pass over its great face, and tell the tale, and perchance rebuke you into forbearance. His features, always articulate with expression, now grew rigid in his wrath. What did they not deserve? They, for whom he had fought;—spilt his blood—with whom he had passed many wintry campaigns, in heroick adventure; what did they not deserve? `Death?'—Death! no, death was too good for them, when, at the bare instigation of their evil nature, their fealty to a capricious girl, they were ready to bind their chosen young warriour, hand and foot, and broil him upon live coals, under her nostrils. In the exasperation of the moment, Harold uplifted his hand, and prayed with a loud voice, for the power of overturning the very mountain upon them, and her, and himself, and perishing, like Sampson, in the ruin and dust of his own strength. But better thoughts soon followed. Was he guiltless? Had he not wronged Loena? And were these faithful creatures wrong in their blind loyalty? A shaggy dog sprang before him!—another! His horse reared and plunged upon the slippery rock, and then stood at bay, with his nose to the ground, and his back turned to the precipice, over which, at every attack of the dogs, he was in danger of stepping, as he retreated. The loud cry of the curs prevented Harold from seeing his danger, until the hinder foot of his charger slid, and he was almost unhorsed, upon the brow of the tremendous cliff, ere the creature answered to his reiterated soothings, by leaping forward at once, upon the foremost dog, and breaking him down with his hoofs, as he stood eyeing the precipice, and shivering. The loud cry of the dog was instantly answered. Heads and feathers began to be seen in the low blasted verdure of the mountain, and the quick gleaming of steel, that flashed from rock to rock. There was not a moment to lose. Harold drew up the reins—wheeled—gave his sure footed horse full scope, and dashed down a ravine—the dust, the rattling of stones, the baying of dogs, and the continual splash of falling earth and gravel, into the water below, announcing his course. His head became giddy—he reeled in the saddle—the water is passed—the descent is over. But hark! more battle for his arm. Another rider was before him. Brief salutation was given Harold knew him; and the whirled tomahawk and the levelled rifle left him no time to doubt that he came as a mortal foe. The tomahawk passed him, widely. The ball whistled by his face. Harold threw himself upon his feet, in the smoke of the shot, plucked the tomahawk from the earth, and hurled it, with a swiftness and precision that was fatal to the horse of his antagonist. It cleft his head, as he reared at its approach, or his master would have met with the same fate. `Thou devil!' cried the stranger, and he vaulted from the saddle of his falling horse, and stood gallantly upon his feet, with his cymeter in his hand. `Englishman!' was Harold's reply: at the same moment loosening the reins of his horse from his arm, and drawing his sabre, with a whistle from the scabbard. The horse reared, and then stood stock still, a patient spectator of the strife, as if conscious that he was to be the trophy of the surviver. Their blades met. Harold was the more wary, the more lightning-like, but the stranger was bolder, and stronger. Both were resolute as death. Several wounds were given, and received. Harold's sword broke to the hilt. He threw himself upon the stranger and bore him to the earth, wrenched his sword from him, and twice, in his blindness and wrath attempted, in vain, to pass it through and through his heart, as they grappled together. But twice the Englishman caught the sharp blade in his hands, and twice Harold drew, it by main force, through his clenched fingers, slowly severing sinew, and tendon, and flesh, and grating on the bones, as it passed. Harold gasped—the Englishman held him by the throat—the blood gushed from his ears and nostrils—once more!—he has succeeded! The blood has started through the pores of the brave fellow below him! His arteries are burst—He is dead—dead!—nailed to the earth, and Harold is sitting by him, blinded, and sick. A half hour has passed. The horse stamps, impatiently, by the corse. Why stands Harold thus, gazing upon the red ruin before him, with such a deadly hatred? Look! his countenance relaxes. He speaks, murmurs. Surely he relents. His face is covered with his reeking hands. He kneels; Almighty God! the murderer kneels by the murdered! The young savage is kissing the forehead of the dead man! O, human nature, how terrible thou art in thy perplexities! Here, here, a child of the wilderness, red with the blood of his brother, agitated to death, but now, with the excess of his own passionate desire of vengeance—behold him, weeping, trembliug, and bowing down, over the slaughter that he has perpetrated. O, heaven! what is the nature of man? It was too late. The youthful stranger was, indeed, dead. The sword was plunged up to the very hilt, through his heart, into the green earth. Harold would fain have plucked it out. But he had not the heart to do it, not even the strength. He attempted it; but the sound of the torn flesh, as the rough and battered edge returned through the cleft vitals, was too horrible. VOL. I. T He sickened, and turned away, in loathing and detestation. `There let it stay, forever!' he cried. `I cannot pluck thee forth, my good blade; and thou, my horse, thou, the prize and issue of the fight, I shall never love thee more!' The horse stood by, rolling his red eyes, not with the calm, haughty contemplation of a proud beast, when murder is going on in his presence, but agitated, like an accomplice, shivering and dismayed. He will not let Harold back him!—why? is it the gleam of the plucked sword, for Harold has, at last, torn it forth, with shut eyes, and a desperate hand?—The brightness is dimmed, discoloured; and upon its ragged edge, gouts of palpitating bloody flesh, are yet adhering—Can it be that? It is! The noble brute shakes with the smell, and the spirit of rebellion is aroused within him. He had snuffed, and tasted the blood of a man, and he could almost tear his own master, in the raging madness that followed. Harold bounded into the saddle. The creature stood trembling in all his joints, as if some wild beast had leaped upon him;—and then reared. For the first time in his life, Harold was unhorsed. He had scarcely touched the saddle, when the animal sprang from under him—toward heaven, too, as if to bear witness against him! Harold arose, in the first transport of his fury; and was only withheld from cleaving the skull of noble creature upon the spot, by perceiving him stop, at the moment, fling down his head, brace his fore feet, and stare, with rivetted and flaming eyes, through the long tresses, which he shook over them, at the dead body; as if he saw a spectre rising from the earth; and then, gradually leaning back, he sat upon his haunches, without stirring his hinder hoofs, as if something very terrible, unseen by aught but himself, were menacing, him. Harold's blood curdled. He attempted to sooth the animal, but for a long time, in vain—the creature's flesh quivered beneath his touch, as if it were raw, and a burning hand were struck upon it. At last, Harold succeeded in mounting him. He was completely subdued. His unnatural wildness had departed, and he was gentle, even to timidity. If a horse could be struck with sudden madness, by snuffing the hot vapour of blood; or if he could see a spectre at noon-day, Harold felt persuaded that his horse had been so, and had seen one. He left his foe—the companion of his boyhood— his rival, his insulter; him who had spoiled him, he knew not how, of his gallant horse; and scorned and baited him, whenever they had encountered, presuming on their earlier friendship—he left him, shuddering, and suffocated in his own black blood. Yea, Harold left him on the green earth—in a holy solitude—to the Demon of the place, the beasts of the field, and the fowls of the air. He left him, forgetting all their former affection, in his hatred; all their former trials of skill, in this, the last deadly trial; all their former wrestling and combat, in this, their last mortal struggle. And yet, some tears fell upon the loose mane before him, as he combed it with his fingers, and thought how he had once loved the man, with whose blood it was now stiffened and tangled; how they had hunted together, swum together, fought together, and—and loved together!' `Heaven blast him, for his treachery,' cried Harold, grinding his teeth, and tearing away a handful of matted hair from the neck of his horse, flinging it to the earth, and riding over it; while his horse, as if full of his master's wrath, struck, and spurned at it, with his sounding hoof. Harold wheeled about, and was almost mad enough to return to the spot, yea, though all his foes were beleaguering the body, and wreak his consummate wrath anew upon the dead man, by hacking, and hewing, and trampling his beautiful limbs to jelly, with the heels of his charger. `Away! away! I have nothing left to love now! My hengeance is exhausted. My mistress abandons me. My tribe disown me. They turn their knives against Harold, now. Whither shall I go? Across the wide water? Yea, let it be so—across the wide water, will I journey, and I care not how soon, be it to the land of souls. I will go out and interrogate the skies, and the ocean!' A cloud came up. Why does he tremble? It hangs before his path. Why shrinks he from encountering it? A peculiarity of shape hath made it familiar to him. Once, in his boyhood, he had seen it there, exactly there! and exactly in that shape too, hanging in the bright sunshine, like a spectre, attached to the rock by the skirts of his robe—a shadow, suspended in the air, by incantation. Harold cast his eyes upward, `And just at this hour! too!' he exclaimed. Could it be, that the mists of evening were of a shape so like humanity? Heaven! just so had he seen it, sixteen years before— he trembled at the thought. What new misfortune was at hand? The form and presence of a man had stood before him. A clap of thunder broke over them, and he was gone!—and now— Hark! a sharp light! a loud voice! `The same thunder,' thought Harold. But he was mistaken. He fell from his horse. He was wounded. A loud yell followed. The next moment, he was surrounded, lashed hand and foot, and borne away. They approached the encampment. Numbers more had arrived. It was almost a village. Every living thing came out to meet him, and curse him. The faggots were prepared before his eyes. All the alarming paraphernalia of death were exhibited to him. It was soon midnight. Harold never stirred a finger, nor uttered a moan. He expected and desired the death, but his heart felt sore, very sore, at the thought of Loena. An Indian lay near him. He watched the countenance of Harold. The unconquerable determination and majesty of his look, awed him. He removed farther off, as if to testify his homage. Others approached. They remembered their allegiance. They remembered of what a kingly aspect had been his boyhood, and they, yes, they, the children of the forest, trembled, and were afraid. But why prolong the detail? Harold soon knew that the hour of his appointed death was at hand. In the deep midnight, his soul was to be required of him, in torture—go up to heaven, in fire and smoke, amid the howling and derision of infernal savages. Might he lift his hand against his own life? Was it permitted to him? Who may answer the question? Surely not he who is beset with evil, and would escape, perhaps by an easy, though surely, by a perilous way. Why shrink we so from the self-murderer? Harold had not forgotten all the sweet lessons of his childhood—His mother, that majestick woman, her royal nature softened and imbued with the rich, warm loveliness, of the loveliest and warmest religion that ever flowed upon the earth, she had often, a brave Indian as she was, wept over her babe, and blessed him with the prayer of the true Christian. He could not forget her. His father had taught him to slay:—she, to spare. He had nursed him for the battle, she, for the heart. He had strung his sinews for fierce, unintermitted action, filled all his arteries with the lava of ambition, rivetted his joints, and taught his muscles to quiver for the untiring conflict. She had taught him to pray, and weep, and love, and be beloved. Hence these eternal contradictions in his movement. There was a perpetual warring of the elements in his head and heart. It was now his hour of trial. He was appointed to die. To die, were a trifle—he had long accustomed himself to think of death with cheerfulness, not only with composure, but with cheerfulness—but to die now, now! when the bright world was just opening to him over the waters—yet even that he could bear—but then, to die so deplorably, in torture—why, even that he could endure. They might broil the very marrow out of his bones, his brain out of his skull, his soul out of his body—he could endure all that—but, O, God, there was no sympathy, no encouragement, no admiration for him. Who could endure it? dying so helplessly, alone —in silence! The dagger was in his hand. He paused—he put forth his arms—the cold sweat started out upon his lips! could it be that the shadow of his mother had uprisen! what was that—that! upon the bright moonlit wall. The form was that of a woman. It came off from the wall, and approached!—Ah, it was no shadow. It was Loena herself! the Indian princess, his own, his beloved one! T 2 She fell upon his bosom, and sobbed aloud. The dagger dropped from his hand. `Harold! O, Harold, and wouldst thou leave me? leave me, forever!' Her trembling lips told how passionately she sought the consolation of his presence. Again and again, he embraced her, soothed her, pressed her head upon his bosom, his lips to her cheek, her eyelids, her forehead, her neck—his very heart dissolving in lofty and innocent rapture—`oh, mine own beloved one!' He uplifted the dagger for a moment, gazed upon the blade, upon the dear countenance, that, with lashes cast down, lips quivering and burning, leant over him —saw it illuminated with an expression, that could not be mistaken, and he flung the weapon from him, with all his strength. She started at the sound—turned, and saw it quivering in the wall—pressed her locked hands convulsively together, and shut her eyes. `What! afraid Loena! afraid, when I am with thee! Know love, that thou hast saved my life. Another murder had been done—another instant, perhaps, and that accursed knife had been buried in my heart.' Loena uttered a cry of horrour. She could not believe her senses. It was not merely the Christian, it was the Indian, whose soul revolted at this crime, this, of all others. `A murderer! a self-murderer, Harold! Thou, after all that thy mother said—at our last meeting—the very last—thou hast not forgotten it. (Harold shuddered, and pressed her more closely to his heart)—thou, a self murderer! O, Harold!' Harold could not reply. His heart was swelling, heaving with gigantick and horrible thought. The mystery of his fate became visible before him. It arrayed itself, all, in all its darkness, with the gleamy flames coursing it about, like fiery serpents; and all its cabalistick characters burning, in legible denunciation upon his eye-balls. Some awful abiding-place seemed opening before his tranced spirit. He remembered the prediction of his great mother—She sat, and the death sweat was upon her cold hand, while she pressed it against his forehead. He felt the wet fingers now!— the very shape, and motionless, chilling weight of the hand, at this moment! A low groan came from beside him. He shuddered, and hid his face. `A self-murderer, Harold! thou! after all that we have read together, all that thy mother, thy blessed mother taught us, so immediately before her terrible death. `Loena,' said Harold, choking. `My mother is avenged. Her murderers are hewed, and trampled on.' `O, Harold! thou, that wouldst not, in thy childhood, have dipped thy innocent hand in the blood of the vilest animal. O, how art thou changed! Now, do I re-remember—hast thou forgotten it?—when thou didst so strive with my two brothers, to rescue the young animal that they were torturing. It nearly cost thee thy life. But for me, the spirited hunters had murdered thee in thy sleep for it. No—no; thou needst not kiss me, Harold—no, thy lips are changed—thy nature!—thou art not the Harold whom I loved—' (and then, she kissed him with her own lips.) Such is woman! Intoxicated by her own tenderness, subdued by her own resolution, and so is man!—kissing and parting, rebuking and weeping, at the same moment. `What!' said the good old Sachem, who had been on an embassy to the whites—`The white men murder, we never murder. They murder themselves! How we shuddered!' `But dear, surely we do murder. We kill, sleeping. We do not, it is true, call it murder. It is our warfare. But, oh, it is murder, I feel that it is.' `Yet who, of all the tribes of North America,' said Loena, `who ever slew himself? none, none. It is a crime unheard of among us, cowardly, and impious!' `I have thought a great deal,' answered Harold, `on this subject; read a great deal; but I am not yet satisfied.' `Not satisfied! what! not satisfied of what—that it is wrong to murder?' `To murder! dear, oh no, I do not doubt that. But surely, it is not murder—it cannot be, for a weary and sick man, to bleed himself to death.' `Harold! I am chilled, chilled, to the heart by thy dreadful calmness. I cannot pretend to reason with thee. Thou art so cold! I can only feel; and I do feel that the everlasting God hath forbidden murder; and that, of all murderers, the self-murderer, is the most unpardonable.' `But—' `Nay, Harold, I will not listen to thee. I hate these buts, and ifs. Even in thy boyhood, thou couldst move my reason at thy will; yea, my very religion and conviction. I fear thy power. I own it. I fear my own weakness. I know that, as Father Paul told thee, years and years ago, that the sure way of making men believe as you would have them, is to give them reasoning that they cannot answer. Their self-love comes in against them, and they yield. If they cannot reply, refute, they are foolish enough to say that their enemy is right. And, yet Harold, there seems to me no subject upon which unanswerable objections may not be started on both sides.' `I do not believe this, Loena—I—' `Nay, Harold, I cannot, will not, reason with thee. I am afraid of thee.' `Afraid of reason, dear!—why, what is our reason given us for? Must we not hearken to it? Nay, Loena, I must do away this errour—I must so, my own passionate, strange girl, I must.' `Harold, I tremble for thee. This infirmity is growing upon thee, night and day. It is not reason. It is sophistry. Wouldst thou use thy noble faculties aright, my friend, my, dear friend; array all that comes to thee, on either side, I should not fear thee. But in thy impetuosity, that which makes against thee is rejected; and that which makes for thee, put forward, with such plausible earnestness, such sincerity of look, and tone; and such energy, such inspiring vehemence, that, at times—why need I conceal it? I feel that thou art irresistible: not because thou art right, but because thou hast the faculty of appearing so.' `O,' cried Harold, in amazement, `who has taught thee, girl, to speak thus? Who ever looked for such timely wisdom, with such youth, and loveliness?' `Hush, Harold. This is another of thy witcheries. She who listens to thee, is flattered in spite of herself.' `How thou hast gained and expanded,' continued he, putting away her hand from his lips, `under the instruction of my dear, dear, mother (his eyes overflowed) and the holy man!' verily, verily, thou art nothing, nothing of the Indian.' `Harold!' cried Loena, tearing herself from his arms, and standing before him, like something suddenly impregnate with divinity, her dark eyes streaming fire, and her pale lips quivering—`Harold! never, never repeat that! I shall curse thee to thy face, if thou durst. Am I so fallen?—Harold—(her voice thrilled through and through him; and her solemn and wild gesture, the awful brightness of her uplifted eyes were before him like something ready, if disincumbered of earth, to ascend by its own immateriality)—`Harold! I would sooner abjure all, all, that I have learnt—forget it, denounce it, curse it! life, name, love, religion—all! all! than forget that I am an Indian girl. Oh, how my blood mounts to assert its birth-right! I feel that I am the daughter of kings. Now, then, tempt me, if thou canst! Triumph if thou canst, I will not yield. My unassisted reason shall wrestle with thine. Thou shalt be overcome, Harold, if this feeling abide with me. But come, be brief. I will no longer tremble to hear thee. If I am right, shall I not convince thee? Is not the self-murderer more criminal than he who murders another? `No, indeed, love, he is not. I may cut off my own hand with less guilt than that of my neighbour. I have a sort of property in my own life, have I not? But what property have I in the life of another; what right, I mean, to dispose of it?' The same Harold—the very same! I feel the spirit of thy mother near me. Thou hast precisely the same right over thine own, as over thy neighbour's life, and no other, nor greater. What is murder? Is it not taking the life of a human creature, deliberately, without the process of law? what matters it then, whether it be your own life, or that of another?' `But do you not perceive, my dear girl, that if you be right, this would prove that both are alike, and not that the self-murderer is the most guilty.' `Nay, hear me through. The crime is the same. Both are equally guilty, the murderer, and the self-murderer. But the great question is for the criminal. He who murders another, may live to repent. But he, who murders himself, cannot. He dies in the very perpetration, the very consummation of his guilt. What, too, is the situation of the murdered man? If one murder another, it is possible that his victim may be one, already anointed for happiness: and it is certain that the murdered one is not dying in the commission of a crime. But the self-murderer is:—the criminal and victim are ever one. `Excellent! This is the reasoning of my own mother. It is worthy of her. But suppose two persons to be upon a plank in the water. Only one can be saved by it. If this doctrine be right, it would be less criminal for one to thrust his fellow off, tear the plank from his clinging hand, and see him drown, than to abandon his own share, and give up the whole, to his fellow creature.' Loena was silent. `But how many have become immortal from self-sacrifice? martyrdom to their religion, and their country. Multitudes lose their lives, and limbs; and many multitudes risk both, at their pleasure, and are applauded by the wisest and best; nay, eulogised as heroes, and gods, and demi-gods.' `Yes, for their country, children, wives, husbands, humanity, Harold.' `But look at me, dear, steadily; Have they a right, so to expose themselves?' `Assuredly. It is a part of religion, providence, wisdom, to give up a part, for the whole. We lop a diseased limb.' `But have we a right to lop off a diseased limb?' `Surely, yes, if it be necessary.' `But who shall be the judge? ourselves?' `Nay, Harold, this is not fair. I see thy purpose. But nevertheless, I answer yes!—we are the judges, we, ourselves, and we, alone. But if we wantonly, and with an evil intention, maim ourselves, we despoil, and disfigure the image of God himself; and sin in the face of heaven.' `Now, Loena, now, I have thee! This is where I would lead thee. It is conceded that we may, at our own good discretion, lop off a limb to save our lives, May we not lop off all, for the same purpose; or, to save our family? May we not give up our lives in martyrdom, in battle, in immolation, to save a people from thraldom, a religion from the scoffer? We are taught to risk our limbs and life in the cause of humanity; to plunge into the flames, the flood, the den of wild beasts; to leap the precipice, tread the waters, and wrestle with death in every horrible shape, to rescue the suffering, or relieve the sorrowful. Whence have we the right to do thus?' `God hath given it to us, Harold.' `What! hath God given us the right to dispose of our limbs and life, as we please?' `No, Harold, no!—not as we please. He hath not.' `Then pursue the consequences, Loena. If he have not, then we may not risk a hair of our heads, because we please, to save the life of a human creature. We have no right, if this be true, to pluck a naked infant from the merciless wolf, or the midnight altar; we may not risk, still less abandon a finger, or a limb, (for the loss of either may eventuate in the loss of life,)—unless we have a right to lay down our lives at pleasure.' `Harold! you wrong me. If I am unintelligible, it is my fault, not that of the subject. What I mean, is this; we cannot expose ourselves, sacrifice ourselves, at pleasure, from whim or caprice, but only when we conscientiously believe that we are right; only when our promptings are pure. And we can all judge of their purity, by looking to their consequences.' `A greed! Such is the triumph of unassisted reason. I glory in thee, woman! Then we have the right of disposing of our own limbs and life, at our reasonable discretion.' `Yes. I cannot deny it.' `No, dear, thou canst not indeed, for if thou didst, it would be a denial and proscription of every virtue; humanity, courage, magnanimity, heroism, all. But if man have this right, where is it to stop? Hath he not of course, the right, whenever he thinks it is right, to lay down his own life, for any reason, no matter what?' `Yes. But a man in his senses cannot believe it to be right to lay it down from mere weariness and discontent.' `I don't know that. Men have different ways of arriving at what we call right. One demands much evidence, another is convinced with little.' `But then, it is cowardly, rash, selfish, to destroy one's self, Harold, for any such reason. How can one know, when he is about killing himself, in the extremest misery, but that God himself, is just at that moment busied in extricating him?' `True, dearest—And how can the martyr, the patriot know, but that God, in his own good time, will set all things right, without requiring his death? How can he tell but that God is only trying him?' `I cannot answer thee, Harold. I wonder at my presumption. I feel anew the evil of disputation. Time and again have I had all my convictions shaken to the earth by thy terrible eloquence—by thy consummate mischief. O, Harold!'—(She was speechless now, with emotion.) `Loena! can it be. Am I so deceived? Wantest thou the courage to pursue, firmly, wheresoever it may lead thee, the light of thine own reason? If not, woe to thee! God, himself will judge thee, with severity. What is thy reason? A light to be followed. And dost thou retreat, and shut thine eyes, when it but flashes for a moment, on some frightful shadow?' `And now, dearest, let me set thee right. The case can never happen, where a man, in the full possession of all his faculties, deliberately goes about the work of self-destruction. He, like the parricide, or the murderer, who acts so deliberately, must be under some fearful infatuation. If he believe it to be right, he is a madman. If he do it, believing it to be wrong, he will be punished in proportion to his own estimate of his own guilt, at the time of his sinning. The world will see no heroism in self-slaughter, perpetrated in loathing and abhorrence of life. It is a disease. But if it find that the deed was done to save others, wife, children, or dear one, a country, or in honour to God, the world will celebrate his memory, with tears and thanksgiving. The right of self-sacrifice must exist, or all business, risk, and humanity, are at an end. But then, that right must be deliberately, thoughtfully, and religiously exercised: a thing that cannot be, where a man flies from the world, despondingly, to avert its evils, however great, in the selfishness and cowardice of his heart. Yet, if he think that he is right in so doing, then, is he right, and God himself, will so judge him, having compassion on his infirmities. We may judge him, but it will be in ignorance, knowing not whether he sinned in his heart, or not, whether his motives were sublime or grovelling, selfish, dastardly, or heroick. But He, who can read all hearts, will judge him with certainty and knowledge. And if he meant rightly, will hold him guiltless, as he would the maniack who should dip his hands in the blood of his own mother! `O, Harold, I tremble for the consequences of this doctrine.' `Why so? If it be sound, leave the consequences to themselves. It matters not, what we think or say. Truth is not changed by controversy. If unsound, controversy will overthrow it, and its consequences will follow.' The moonlight shone upon their faces—they embraced, and slept: slept, like two children, innocent and lovely, and helpless; without one impure thought, one throb of sensuality, to disturb their beloved dreaming—` Their priest was solitude.'</field>
      <field name="fulltext">VOL. I. U CHAPTER XIII. `A Boy, whose whole delight consists In kissing, and in being kist'— `Thrice had the moon her pearly chariot driven Across the starry wilderness of Heaven.' `Shame and dishonour sit By his grave ever! Blessing shall hallow it, Never, oh, never!' `My own! my beloved Loena! I wanted but to be with thee, near thee, thus again; to feel thine innocent heart swelling against mine: thus to know, as thou art leaning on my bosom, love, that I am indeed, very dear to thee. O, thank thee! This trembling, this emotion— surely, there is no doubting the eloquent language of chaste endearment. But why, what ails thee, Loena?—art thou weeping, love? It is very dark, but thy breathing is violent, and—stay—tears!—yes, thou art weeping! O, tell me why? I feel the drops upon my own cheek. What troubles thee? Hast thou aught to conceal? Aught to fear? Nay, my beloved, I cannot be answered, even with a pressure like that—thrilling as it does, through nerve and bone, like electricity. Tell me in words, my beautiful and good Loena, what troubles thee? `Oh, Harold, I cannot speak.' (Her hand fell timidly upon his bosom—she breathed upon his cheek—a hurried breathing, humid and faint—) `I have been doubted, Harold—Shame on my lips for uttering the word!—doubted, and by thee! Shame on my tears, too! They tell too plainly of my humiliation and sorrow. Harold, I cannot endure it. My heart is broken. Have I not been thine, thine alone, from my childhood? when have I wandered, in look or word, or thought? And now—oh, it is hard to be borne!—to have the faith, the allegiance, the very religion of my heart doubted. What I have done for thee Harold, has been done, almost with the feeling of a bride. Bear witness for me, mother of Harold! princess! daughter of Logan! when have I wavered? And why have I been doubted? No, no, Harold, I cannot forget it. I love thee. I do not deny it. I cannot deny it. Thy own mother taught me that such an acknowledgment might be made at times, by the most shrinking and sensitive woman— and I—I have never breathed it before—never! though my heart felt heavy with a load of unutterable tenderness! and often, oh, how often have I held my breath, in the desire of relieving it by confession, but I could not. I never could, till now. And now, if thou couldst see my face, I should die, I verily believe. Give me thy hand—is there no fever in my forehead? Did thy temples ever throb like that? O, they are sore with thought and tenderness—aching with my devout meditation upon thee. We seem to be met now, Harold, as by the appointment of heaven, and now, having told thee how dear, how very dear thou art to me—Nay, do not interrupt me, I say all this, to prepare thee, the more assuredly, for my resolution. I have determined, and thou knowest too well the blood of the Logans, to doubt that I can do all that I determine, all that I threaten.' `Threaten—Loena!' `Yea, threaten, Harold! It is a threatening, not only of thee, but of myself. I have at last determined.' `Do not look upon me thus. I cannot see thine eyes, it is true, but I can feel them. They are rivetted upon me. The tone of thy voice thrills me. It is dreadfully solemn. Nay, Loena, I adjure thee! Do not pronounce the words. I know not what they are, but thy gasping frights me, do not, do not—as thou lovest me. If there be aught which thou prizest in me; aught that thou wouldst purify and elevate, speak. I am in thy hands. Do thou thy work, in constancy, and love, and I am thine, thine! body and soul, forever and ever! But Loena, do not, I cannot breathe yet—do not threaten me. Tears again! how cold thy lips are, love—well, well—finish what thou wouldst say—do with me as thou wouldst. A child of Logan weeping! Who could withstand it? Come, come—thy resolution, love.' `To abandon thee, forever!' `Me!—me!—Almighty God!' `Nay, Harold, calm thyself:—to abandon thee forever: Let me finish—if ever thou tremblest again, for my love.' `O bless thee! bless thee! dearest—best of women!' `Nay—let me proceed. If I am ever again doubted, be thou where thou wilt—over the great water—beyond the stars—in the bed of the ocean, with the earthquake—shut up in the subterranean palaces of the earth, I care not where, nor when—If I be ever again doubted by thee, Harold, then, farewell, forever!' She fell upon her knees, as she uttered these words, and bowed her head in supplication, upon his hands. Harold knelt at her side, and held her convulsively to his heart, which was ready to burst from his side, in the agony of his delight. `God bless thee!' he murmured, as his trembling lips faintly touched her soft, smooth neck—`God bless thee! I shall never, never again doubt thee. Nay, I never have doubted thee; but some how or other, Logan —accursed be the recollection!—It rises like a spectre before me, and menaces me even now. Look! look!— Spirit of the wilderness! * * Man of blood! * * whence art thou? * * why comest thou upon me? * * I feel thine unhallowed approach * * * Oh, shield me, love— his cold hand is near me:—oh, how cold!' He fell, in his delirium, upon the ground, before the terrified girl. She raised him, pressed her little hand upon his hot forehead, with the devout and inexpressible tenderness of one, who joys to show all her love to a sleeping, or insensible dear one—`Harold, dear Harold! look up.' He moved and strained her with a delirious expression of horrour and dismay, to his bosom! `Hist! hist! Ah, no, no, no!—my wound.'—Now, for the first time, did these two creatures discover that he was drenched with his own blood. Loena staunched it with her hair her lips—and held his sick and weary head upon her lap, all the live long night. He slept, and she wept over him. He awoke, sore, and feverish, but in the full recollection of the past. `Am I to be impaled, sacrificed now!' he said, smiling in her face, and pressing her hands to his mouth. She could not answer. She smiled too, and a tear fell upon his lip. `I am going across the water, love.' `The great water, Harold?' `Yes, dearest, the great water; not to the land of souls; but I shall go somewhere, and consummate my dreaming. I hate barbarism. I hate ignorance. It is abject, ignoble, slavish. And I go, love, to prepare myself for leading thy people, princess—forth, from barbarianism and ignorance, to liberty and light!' Her eyes flashed fire! `assuredly Harold?—art thou determined? Wilt thou go? Hast thou, oh, hast thou, the constancy for such a trial? Canst thou pursue that object forever, through all peril, all intimidation, sickness, death, and sorrow, and humiliation? Canst thou leave me—me!—and remember only my people? O, if thou canst, Harold, thou art, indeed, my chosen one. I will fall down and worship thee! Speak, thou man of my idolatry!' `Yea, all, all!—even to the abandonment of thee!' As they said this, they stood erect, their arms intertwined, and hands outstretched to the blue sky, which broke out upon them, with the unbreathed, unpolluted light of a new day, all at once! and they resembled, in their beautiful proportions, and bold, agitated drapery, two pieces of surpassing statuary, suddenly endowed with life, and just descended from their pedestals, arm in arm. They embraced. They looked upward, and heaven shed a luminous benediction upon the foreheads and eye lids of both. They sank down again, side by side, overpowered by the tumultuous sublimity of their feeling. `Harold! Harold!' whispered Loena, in a tone of delighted eagerness and intensity, that went thrilling to his vitals. `I have determined. I too, will do worthily for my people.' `How child?' cried Harold, pressing his lips, doubtfully, to her cheek. `I will go with thee.' `Thou! thou!—with me, over the wide water!' `Yea, Harold, as did she of the Holy Scripture; saying, U 2 `thy God shall be my God; and whither thou goest, I will go.' `O, bless thee! bless thee, woman. This is too much. God, I thank thee! This is religion!—this is inspiration.' A long, and breathless silence followed. No thought of means occurred to these enthusiastick, heedless creatures. Peril they could endure—death, in each other's arms—but peril and death were less likely to thwart them, and dishearten them, than the ten thousand petty, contemptible vexations of real life. A convulsive sob broke from her. Her cheek lay against Harold's. `Sit up love,' she said, fondly, twining her arms around him, and pressing the ligature, that dripped redly yet, with the blood of his veins, `Sit up love, and let me tell thee all about thy rival— what!—breathing quicker at his name only!—and he's dead!—O, Harold, Harold!' `He was my father.' `What! Logan?—he, thy father! merciful heaven!' `Yes, Loena, he was—my own father.' A shriek of horrour and surprise burst from her pale lips.' Thy father! Harold—that man of blood— the faithless, and terrible. He who slew men as he would drink their veins dry, and doated on their agony. He, who stove in the skull of an old man, in full council, and spattered the brains in the faces of his children? —He!—O, impossible! it cannot be. And yet, Harold-I have detected some startling resemblances—the untamaeble fierceness of thine eye—Nay, I have thought, at times, that there was a general likeness between you and that, had he been young, or thou older, and troubled like him, and tempted like him, thou wouldst have been another Logan. And yet, never did I shrink from thy amazing energy, as from his. O, can it be?' `It is so. Another time, and I will tell thee all. See the eastern horizon is all a blaze!' `What a being he was, Harold! My very blood curdles at the recollection of him. How he stood! His dominion was darkness. He was shrouded in impenetrability. His collossal attributes had no fellowship with humanity. He was sublime, and incomprehensible—walking the earth, like one born and trained for command.' `Aye, woman, he was trained for command. His adamantine heart was unsoftened, unblessed with one touch of infirmity—so bloody, so terrible:—A magnificent creature, in eclipse—a planet, which, in rebellion, broke away from its orbit, whirling and thundering, darkly, through the region of vacuity; shattering, consuming, and extinguishing all that it encountered. A being, alike formidable, living or dead, sleeping or waking, at all times, and in all seasons. Logan walked the earth with the intimidating aspect of one too awfully secure of his power—of one, whom the earth could not disincumber itself of. His voice was not to be disobeyed. All acknowledged their allegiance to him, by their fears, while they denied it with their lips. And all paid it, reluctantly, and in hatred—it was the tribute of blood and sweat—paid too, to the uttermost far thing, and that satisfied him. He cared not with what disposition it was paid. He wrenched his assessment from the strong and mighty. He would have wrestled with archangels for their sceptres and crowns—with the damned, for their preternatural, and guilty ascendancy, at the peril of ten thousand lives, with the same indifference. All was alike to him, so it was power. His ambition was a vulture; it gorged on offal, but it was the offal of kings. What a being he was! I tremble to think of him, even in his grave. My heart quakes like jelly at his name. Nay—hist!—love—hist! hast thou ever seen him since his death—whisper it low. Hast seen him of late?' `Seen him!—Harold—See a dead man!—' `A dead man!—true, dearest, true. Dead—dead— yea, Loena, dead, almost by the hands of his own child —but still—still'—(his voice became inexpressibly solemn, and he laid his hand upon her with steadiness)— Still, he walks the earth.' `Mercy, Harold! how cold thy hand is; let me warm it love, in mine. And thou shakest too, like the red leaf of Autumn, in the mountain blast—O for shame!' `Speak! tell me all of him. He wooed thee, thee! my own, my dearest one: my own father!—O, my brain— Speak Loena, I cannot bear this, another moment: cannot, will not, brook the trial longer.' `Well then, it were a long story, Harold; and I cannot tell thee all the terrifick deeds he did; deeds of terrour and blood—achievements of a nature, so heroick and sublime, and dreadful, that these rocks would fall at their repetition. He faced the battle. He trampled the breath out of the wild beast. He met, and tore asunder, the jaws of the bear, and the catamount. He swam torrents, forded rivers, galloped the inaccessible mountain, played his archery above the clouds, bathed himself, over and over again, to drunkenness and delirium, in the blood of the white men—nay, of the red men, too, in the unsparing bitterness of his wrath—a creature, born and baptized in hot gore—whose baby fingers dabbled in the reeking vitals of slain children— all this he did—merely—oh how little he knew of woman's nature! the nature, even of an Indian woman— merely to win Loena!' `He sought some creature of sublimity—some bosom, upon which Ambition himself, might lay his throbbing head, wearied and aching with royalty: but he sought her in smoke and flame.' `He spoke in council. The oldest and wisest were mute before the authority of his presence. The great men, the old and mighty were subdued by his bearing. They stood before him, awe-struck. He was their champion, their leader, ready to vindicate their wrongs, and bear down, in thunder and lightning, upon their foes, wherever they lay, and drive them to the four corners of the earth. Could they resist him? He dictated his terms of perpetual alliance—the love of their princess! Half of the dagger handles, and one half of the tomahawks were grappled at the word. Did he shrink? No. He mocked and scorned, and derided, and dared them them, all. `Go,' he said, `go! and leave your princess unwived, unwed; yourselves, the sport and derision of all men; the curse and bye-word of Indian and white. Ye! ye! the children of Logan—of him, who went forth, in battle and in blood, like the great sun of heaven, in one untiring course, till he was avenged. And ye! what are ye? How have ye submitted to wrong, and insult, and encroachment? And why? Shame on your dastard councils! Who am I? An adopted child. Be it so. Mate me among yourselves, if you can. Let him come forth—here! here!—and put his life and limb in the jeopardy that I have, ten thousand times for you. And would ye refuse him?' `My offer is made. I never repeat it. You have one hour to think of it. I came in faith to you. If I depart, remember!—it is I, I! Logan, that pronounce the malediction. Accursed be your race! unsparing war, and shame, and desolation, be, and abide upon you, forever, and ever! My hand shall wage it to the last, and after me, shall arise others, more terrible, more unappeasable.' `I was sent for. Logan stood erect, in the smoke of the council fire: his huge limbs darkened and revealed, alternately, in their barbarick nakedness, like bronze statuary, in the shining light of the consecrated ewer, and the rolling of the golden vapour that issued from it, with an offensive odour. Not a nerve trembled. The orator repeated his speech. Logan extended his hand. I put it from me. He advanced. I planted my foot, and menaced him with my countenance. But he was not to be intimidated. He smiled fiercely, laid his hand upon my shoulder, and would have embraced me. I, maddened to desperation, at the indignity, smote him, and he fell. My knife was buried in his side.' `He staggered, and fell. The light became suddenly extinct, as he rolled over the sacred vessels. We were in darkness; and I retreated. We heard a shriek! It was from my woman. The young men sprang from their seats. The cry passed rapidly away through the forest. They pursued. But it was too late. Their own noise prevented them from distinguishing the route of Logan. We soon discovered the truth. Wounded as he was, Logan had borne off my attendant, with the speed and strength of a wild beast. Was not mine a most providential escape?' `Our young men continued the pursuit, with torches and rifles. The moon suddenly shone out, and we caught a glimpse of him, ascending that hill, by the lake. Twenty rifles were instantly levelled at his head. But, confident that they would not shoot at him, while he held her in his arms, he laughed their threats to scorn. He hugged the poor creature to his heart, and was ascending just over the precipitous cliff of the blue lake—when suddenly—oh God! I never shall forget that look, and gesture!—He stopped—we held our breath in terrour. He appeared, for the first time, to have discovered his mistake. The moon shone directly upon me. He dropped her, and she clung to his knees. He stood still for a moment, gazing upon me, and her, alternately, with his hands clenched, and advanced. The next, he stooped down—tore her hands from her face—she shrieked—and he caught her up, as if she were an infant; rushed to the very brink of the crumbling precipice, from which the earth and stones, loosened by his heedless footstep, fell and rattled, in the wave below. The sound appeared to revive the terrified girl, for I could perceive her shiver all over, convulsively, in the moonlight, and reach out her arms, as to clasp him round the neck—She caught his garment —but in vain—in vain!—he tore it away, and held her out at arm's length, over the terrible abyss, for a moment, as if enjoying her distraction—and then— O, merciful Heaven! Harold—my heart grows sick at the thought—my head swims—I can see her now!— hear her now!—the monster hurled her, headlong, from the height! We saw her clothes fluttering, and shut our eyes, with one universal shriek of horrour and dismay. We heard his horrible mockery above—and the next moment, as nearer, a faint, desperate cry. Blinded and giddy as I was, I opened my eyes involuntarily—the body appeared suspended in the air—it wheeled, swang, turned, and appeared to touch a projecting crag. I thought that I should have dropped dead upon the spot, in the agony of my hope. I saw the dear creature put out her hands, and grasp at the shubbery, and then, at the matted tissue of green tendons, that overhung the rock—But O, God! O, God! I saw it gradually yield; and the loose earth, roots, and ivy, all falling together! Another faint cry followed: and the next moment, a loud splash, below us, accompanied with the rattling of innumerable pebbles. O, that cry, Harold! So helpless! so thrilling!—Gracious God! I have heard it every night since, in my sleep. It is eternally ringing in my ears. Let me lean on thee—I am giddy, and sick, Harold, with the recollection.' A long silence followed. `From that hour, we never met—Logan and I. Now, Harold, canst thou doubt me?' `I cannot answer thee,' he replied, straining her to his heart.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XIV. `Come sit thou with me!—what a heavenly night! The wind blowing fresh, and the beautiful light Shedding out such a luminous dampness above!— `O, lift up thine eyes! see the firmament spreading, A moveable vault of the deepest of blue! Rolling on—rolling on, through infinity, shedding, Forever—an ocean of lustre and dew!' `Come sit thou with me! we shall both learn to feel, Like the men of old times, when Jehovah was near— Come sit thou with me!—and together we'll kneel, And pour out our hearts to the God that is here!' `Oh, whither is your march, ye stars!—and whence?' `Yea, my own, my beloved Loena—yea!—let us depart. We are now sufficiently recovered.' Three weeks had passed; three weeks of consummate happiness— both were so young, and one so innocent. It was night. The awful magnificence of heaven, blazing with the annals of Jehovah, was revolving about them. `Kneel we here, love, in the deep devotion of our hearts; kneel we here, love, in the solemn and profound stillness that encompasses us. Let us ask a blessing of the Great Spirit—a benediction upon us, while we are wedded in his star-light. Yea, let us, my Loena, and then, away to the wilderness!' They knelt together: her warm cheek rested upon his; her dark tresses hung, waving over his bosom, and her gentle hands were clasped, with the sweet feeling of reliance, deep, deep, unutterable tenderness, supplication, and confidence. Heart throbbed against heart; mouth breathed upon mouth; and their intertwining arms, in the pure innocence of their embrace, trembled at the same moment, with the same sensations. The clouds rolled backward. The tips of the far forest green gradually reddened and brightened to a ridge of undulating fire, rippling and burning along the horizon. Daylight poured down upon the valley. A bright, shadowy commotion followed; and thin sparkling, hasty flashes, and coloured illuminations, were seen, mingling and eddying with the dim, and retiring mist, as if the elements of air and water, vapour and colour, electricity, sunshine, and the rainbow, were all wandering together. What a spectacle! What amplitude and elevation! The glorious divinity of man puts on its crown and sceptre, at moments, and in scenes like this, and walks out upon the hill tops, express with irresistible power, holding communion with the shapes of Heaven; parleying with them that encompass God's throne; and feeling dominion over all the things of earth! The scenery brightened. The morning came freshly down the mountains. The blue water shone, in bright patches, through a rent veil of scattering vapour, so beautifully! and the little waves rippled so spiritedly in the tincturing sunshine! Down, far down, in its depth, the tremulous morning fire ran, in coloured and quick streaking, like the light of assembled jewelry, quickly revolving, and there lost and renewed, again and again, as if the water itself were an illuminated depth—became—a— `Away love!' cried Harold; and along they bounded together, by the green banks of the water, alternately pausing, looking upward, peering for a moment, into each other's eyes—catching a hasty and delighted kiss, like a mother playing with her babe. Onward they strove, almost without aim, or preparation. But who would wonder? They loved. The only definite notion that they had, was, that, to reach the great water, they must penetrate the wilderness; fight, toil, bleed, and suffer all extremes of hunger, peril, nakedness, and woe. Hunger, peril, nakedness and woe! What are they to Harold and Loena? They loved, and were beloved. The night came. Both were weary, and they slept in each other's arms—alone, alone, in the holiest, tranquillest solitude. The very beast of the field, the wild animal of the forest, the terrible reptile, the rattlesnake that haunted these mountains, and beset their way over the loose rocks, like them that first contemplated our first parents, spared Harold and Loena; passed by, and left them, unmolested, and slumbering. Another day passed—another—wearied of plucking wild flowers, and wreathing them round the forehead of the blushing, and delighted girl, Harold now led her forward, her dark eyes languidly shining with excess of love, and her beautiful form gradually yielding to the irresistible power of fatigue; till, on the evening of the fourth day, he discovered, by the throbbing of her temples, and the quick, broken respiration of the dear, patient creature, that they had already travelled too far, unrefreshed, unsustained, but by the thin, unsubstantial aliment of love alone—love, almighty love! He threw himself down, by a bubbling fountain—in the warm sunset, half way to the bottom of a shorn and barren hill, where, like a flood, the last sweeping of sunshine, came rolling over the mountains, and spread away upon the assembled and exulting woods and waters, like a shower of drifting fire, raining at once, from one half of the firmament. Roots and herbs were no longer to be her nourishment. Her stomach rejected both. On flowers and fondness, and kisses, she had been fed to satiety. Yet she besought him, for she saw him preparing his ammunition, and drawing the ball from his rifle, and she knew VOL. I. X that she could not accompany him. She besought him not to leave her. `Leave thee! Oh, never, never, love. Thou wilt go with me?' `I cannot, cannot.' `Merciful Heaven!' cried Harold, his rifle dropping from his hand. `Art thou indeed, so ill, my love?' `Indeed, Harold, I am very, very ill. My brain aches. My heart throbs, even to bursting. The very veins upon my hand—look! (the extended hand crept timidly, and tremulously to his bosom—) are distended and sore. I feel a most painful tightness, as of a hot wiry ligature, over my eye-balls.' It was too true. Harold cursed himself for his criminal thoughtlessness. Why had he led her so far away, alone, unprepared? He knew not. He wondered at his own infatuation, blindness, and temerity; his unworthy, boyish selfishness, to lead such a delicate creature, over such a thorny and precipitous way, depending upon chance for nourishment. `No, love, no. I will never leave thee—never! Together we have lived, together journeyed, thus far, and together we will die, love.' He sat down; loosened the fur mantle from his shoulders; drew her hot forehead to his bosom, and wrapped her about, with his arms and dress. Her meek eyes were lifted to his, and she smiled mournfully, but sweetly, as if the thought of dying thus, in his arms, were no sorrow to her. As they lay thus, their hair mingled, and Harold's hand buried in her luxuriant tresses, as he supported her weary head—he was startled by a sound above him. It was a bird—the first that he had seen for days. It was a wild pigeon. He knew it by its flight, and his heart swelled. `It is a bird,' said he, to himself, gently disengaging his arm from the sleepy Loena, whose innocent lips opened and smiled upon him, in her dream, with a delicate whispering of his name—`it is a bird that never flies alone.' A convulsive, shivering delight ran through him, as he rivetted his eye, in the intensity of his hope, upon that quarter of the Heaven, whence the bird had first approached. He was not deceived. Another, and another came, till he could endure it no longer. He sprang upon his feet. He fired, and a pigeon came fluttering, from mid-heaven, almost to his feet. Loena started at the sound of the shot, and in the first terrour of the moment, shrieked to find herself alone. The next, her head was supported upon his knee, the bosom of the bird was laid open, and applied, bleeding, to her lips. She shut her eyes, in her loathing, but still, with an unconquerable eagerness, that showed how nearly famished she was, she pressed her mouth to it, and, if her newly opened eyes told true, she drew new life with the red moisture from its heart. Harold leant over her with looks of unutterable fondness. He was the happiest of human beings? Her eyes shone again—her bosom heaved—and she was near him, with her eloquent features newly kindled. How could he be other than the happiest of human beings? He fell upon her neck, and wept. From the profound repose that followed, while Harold lay, shielding his dear girl from the autumnal chill, he was awakened by the sound of a human voice. He snatched his rifle. A venerable man, with a youth by his side, stood near him. `I am in pursuit of thee, Harold,' said the old man. `Of me!' said Harold, in astonishment, at hearing his name pronounced so familiarly. `Who art thou? Whence?' `It matters not who I am. I am sent to thee, for awhile.' `Sent to me! by whom? and for what?' `I know not by whom. I was alone in the woods. I am a stranger to thee. I knew not that there was such a being yet on earth. Something appeared to me—A spirit, I should think, if such things are permitted. What hast thou done, young man? It commanded me to track thee.' `Tell me,' said Harold, gasping for breath—`how did it look? angry? menacing? terrible?—were not its great limbs red with blood?' `With blood! ha!—so young!—and art thou haunted by a murdered man? Child, I pity thee.' This was accompanied by a look of such horrour, such unutterable horrour, that Harold's blood froze. `But tell me, old man, what said he? How did he look?' `He bade me seek thee, here, and be thy guide and counsellor. Of his looks, I can remember nothing; it was in twilight that I saw him, and his dazzling eyes terrified me.' `His dazzling eyes! Was he an aged man—very small—speaking—oh, I know not how?' `Like the musick of the wild reed?—the same—' `Yes—yes—a mournful voice—a voice that will not be disobeyed.' Harold was silent. Who was this mysterious guardian? Good, or evil? Good, without question, for it rebuked him, and the evil one would not. `Thou art going to Quebec, my son.' `To Quebec!—oh no. We are going to—to—'(and his face crimsoned, as he felt that he had no place to go to—no aim, no object; a desolate creature, wandering in the solitude.) How far is it, father?' `The journey of nearly one moon,' quoth the old man. `And how far, by the nearest way,' said Harold, `to the great water?' `We pass the great water.' `No—no—not the lakes. I mean the waters in the East.' The old man looked upon him in silence, for some moments. `What!' said he, `the water beyond the barbarians—the whites? Wouldst thou go there? The sun will roll in blood, upon thy path. Thou, an Indian—a Logan—and durst thou go among them?' `Aye, father—aye!—I dare.' `Go then—apostate!' That voice was not new to Harold! It startled him. Where had he heard it? He turned a troubled eye upon the old man, but there were no places for memory in his stern, venerable aspect: and yet, his voice! He spoke again, with a tone of more decided authority. Harold's blood began to boil. His brow contracted, and his eyes shot fire. The old man continued talking, and menacing him with his hand, in a heavy and monotonous repetition— appalling beyond endurance, to the impatient Harold. `We have met,' said Harold, `where was it?' `In council.' `O, right!' answered Harold, leaping backward, and levelling his rifle, with the hope of anticipating the tomahawk, which was, in his imagination, already aimed at him. Harold was in the presence of one, the son of whom he had slain! This father was sprinkled with the smoking brains of his own child. The avenger of blood was at hand. But why had he spoken? Why, when he had stolen upon him in his sleep, had he not slain him at once? Was he reserved for torture? That stripling, perhaps. Harold looked again in the boy's face, and wondered at himself, that he had not before observed the resemblance between him and the son whom he had slain. They were brothers; and Harold had spared the child, even after his hand was twisted into his hair, solely in mercy to the desolate voice of the aged father, who had shrieked out—`O spare my son! my only son— the child of my old age!' Harold looked again. The old man's countenance relented. `There, said he, at last, with a convulsive effort—`there! take my hand, young man: take it—the hand of the father!—He forgives thee—the blood of his boy, and thus he requites thee. With the last of his name, he pursues thee, to tell thee that thy steps are haunted; that thou art doomed to death.' `By whom?—for what?' `By mine own tribe, and by thine; for slaying a man in council, and for bearing off their queen. But here am I—I—I—with mine only child, ready to battle for thee —and so is he, poor babe—art thou not, my son?' The boy's eyes sparkled. He struck his arm into his bosom; and the long hunting knife glimmered like a flame in his little hand. `What were Harold's feelings? He could have fallen upon his knees, and wept at the feet of the great X 2 old man, who had thus so mightily striven against his habits and passions, and spared the murderer of his son; not only delaying to strike, when no human help could have saved that murderer, but now guiding him, at the peril of his life, away from the avenger of blood. Harold was his murderer. He had slain him, unpreparedly, in a holy place; and his blood had spouted, hot and smoking, upon the calumet of peace, and clotted and polluted the sacred vessels, and the consecrated doves. Once, Harold had felt that he did rightly. But now, O, how cruelly! he felt that, before the father, he had no justification, he could have none. For who can withstand the rebuke of a bereaved old man? Who can look steadily in the dull eyes of a gray haired father, when they are suddenly lighted up, at the approach of his son's conquerour! Their feeble illumination is that of an expiring lamp, in a sepulchre, fed by corruption; shining out from a festering corpse, upon the murderer himself, as he passes. Harold wept. He did weep. He told his story. The old man listened, and forgave him again, nay, applauded him; for it was a religious sacrifice, he found. It was in obedience to a vow, and made to the manes of his own mother! He told all—all—his love and destiny. The old man kindled. He raised his dim eyes to Heaven; uplifted his thin, trembling hands, and blessed him. `Thou art born, child of the forest,' said he; `verily thou art born, to redeem and restore our race. His blessing be upon thee!—His! Logan's!—he was our enemy, but we reverence him. Forward! forward! to Quebec. Forward, and accomplish thy destiny. Thence, to the world beyond the water. I will attend thee to Quebec. I know the governour. He will protect and advise thee.' `But Loena'—She awoke and listened. And onward they journeyed, in cheerfulness and constancy; alternately hunting, swimming, and recounting the deeds of their fathers. At last, thank heaven, their dangers were passed. By their precaution, in travelling chiefly at night, using arrows for their game, and kindling no fires, they had eluded their pursuers. They came, all at once, in sight of the stupendous fortress of Quebec. It arose in abrupt, castellated, rocky fragments, boldly out of the horizon and water, like the strong hold of some river divinity; a piled-up, and adamantine, immoveable congregation, of battlements and thrones. The point of view was from a sloping headland, that descended gently toward the water, and then broke off into a perpendicular precipice, so that the vessels that approached, appeared for a time, to enter the earth below their feet, at full sail, and disappear, and emerge, successively. It was hard to resist the delusion. Our wanderers stood upon the extremest height of this elevation. It was just after daylight. The far off spires and turrets of the city had begun to leave a determined and accurate outline on the sky, with all their strong features, and abrupt colouring. Here was a subdued purple, fading away into a bluish grey, aerial and transparent; there, a pinnacle of shining silver, to appearance, (the steeples were covered with tin)—and at last, along the whole sweep of the horizon, the whole magick and magnificence of the landscape, came out gradually, under the growing light, like a faded picture, under the application of heat; every moment gave restoration to some hue, some tint, some bold charactering, or some undulating beauty. The plains of Abraham were away to the left; the soft sward then unconsecrated with the blood of the brave—untrodden, unprofaned by armed heels, and iron hoofs. Away to the right, passed off a retired range of broken and beautiful elevations, about what are now called Montmorenci and Beauport. The traveller who may have visited this antiquated city since, and stood upon the same ground, will have found nearly the same appearances about him, that were visible to our wanderers. Like the walled towns of Europe, a whole century changes the appearance of Quebec, less than a dozen years will, some of the republican cities of America. The walls become a sort of outline, beyond which the genii of the place dare not trespass; over which the god Terminus hath interdicted all passing. The Quebec that Harold saw, with a feeling of giddy and tumultuous delight, and a fullness of heart, inexpressibly strange, was altogether the Quebec, that you, in America, may now see, in all its majectick, amazing strength, and distinctness. A broken, bare, and heaped up precipice of solid, black rocks was the immoveable foundation of the city. Her glittering spires, here and there, shot up like beacon flames, spirally waning to a point in the blue heaven. Nay, even the citadel of the present day, (or at least, when I last saw it, it was) is almost the counterpart of that, which then towered over the topmast elevation of this second Gibraltar; and even then, the splendid fragments of some bright edifice, profusely scattered over the rocky earth, had given to one particular spot, the name of the Diamond cape. The Indians held a tradition that it was a palace of chrystal, inhabited by a family of benevolent creatures, who, at the first approach of the white man, shattered their dwelling place into dust, and vanished. The castle of Saint Louis too, was entirely the same, (notwithstanding successive improvement, since,) in the effect of its general proportions. The bold, abrupt manner of its architecture; and the noisy intermixture of cries, and rattling wheels, and bells, from the upper and lower towns, gradually brightened upon the eye, and swelled upon the ear, with the effect of a great drama, and a constantly increasing chorus. It was beautiful!—The laquered sky above, full of ten thousand colours, of such a peerless lustre—almost transparent, indeed—with the thin flinging, here and there, of a vapoury radiance, like smoke from a censer, glittering in the wind, and stretching before it; the green water below; the sun rolling upward through an illuminated firmament—a river, too, of black water, thundering into the deep green of the St. Lawrence, and smoking and foaming in the contact—a vast, naked rock before you, with all its structures and population, apparently emerging from its bowels, as they ascend in your sight—the ships away below, passing and repassing, in the hot sunshine—O, who can forget such scenery?—the warming and expansion of his spirit, when it first broke upon him! Such are the places of meditation among them that heaven hath endowed with an exalted nature. At such moments, man buoys himself up, in the loftiness of his eagle thought, like some mighty bird, hovering over worlds, and contemplating them, as they successively emerge, and revolve in the light—poising herself in mid heaven; resting, self-sustained, and abiding in the outstretched chamber of her own plumage. Then comes the feeling of immortality to him. The soul stands, refreshing herself at the fountain of inspiration, with her eyes waiting fearlessly upon the magnificent boundlessness of God's power, as exhibited in the untenanted space above her; and approaching, every moment, nearer and more near to her appointed habitation with the stars—and leaving, every moment, further and further below her, the earthiness and sensuality, the melancholy, and mournful things of earth. `My own Loena!' cried Harold, pressing her deliriously to his heart. It was the first loud word spoken, from the commencement to the consummation of their devout enjoyment, as they stood and wondered, on the high hills, at the prodigal munificence of their Creator, and their own insensibility—`How beautiful!' he added. `Is'nt it!' with a slight, tremulous pressure of her hand, was her reply. Voices were now heard approaching, nearer and nearer yet. They suddenly ceased. A turn in the road below, had caused this beautiful effect. It was, as if a people had gone by, in the air—invisible, and cheerful. `Let us on,' quoth Harold, and he beckoned to the old Indian and his boy, who, feeling no desire to clamber so fatiguing a hill for the satisfaction of looking about them afterward, were quietly stretched out in the grass, and smoking below. Nothing seemed to agitate these creatures—young or old, they were always imperturbable. They wondered, but it was without sign or indication, at the forbearance of Harold and Loena, so near a great city, yet pausing to look back upon what they had been familiar with all their lives; water and wood, sky and hill. They knew not how absorbing a passion was love; how wonderfully the capabilities of the heart, the lips, touched with kisses as with a live coal, and thrilling thence-forth, with no mortal eloquence, are excited and exasperated by the intense fervour of such a passion; how alive and sensible, the veriest dolt is, to the innumerable and viewless things of air and thought, forever after being so touched. Even Harold felt its purifying and ennobling influence more and more, every day, and almost every hour. He wondered at himself; he never was so perfectly happy, so benignant: and never before had he felt so keen a relish for the triumphant exhibitions of nature; never, no never, such a pure sense of religion in his soul. And Loena!—O she could have lived and died upon her knees, and wept her heart away, in the delicious silence of her soul, as she looked about over the wide world, the calm sky—an outcast, a wanderer, a woman, with no arm near her but Harold's, no heart caring for her, on earth, but his. Such is love! There is no solitude, no desert, no silence, no helplessness, where that is felt. `They are not in love,' said Harold, softly, as he observed the gentle smile of Loena's eyes, when she looked down, and wondered at the apathy of their Indian guides—`they are not in love; if they were, they would not mind mountains. They would clamber over the battlements of heaven, to hold high intercourse with shapes resembling the beloved one.' They now approached the city. A motley herd, apparently of all nations, poured out from all the streets, in one incessant stream. Their Indian guides went first, but they attracted little or no attention. The venerable and august, the youthful and fiery Indian were all somewhat common in the streets of Quebec. But when Harold and Loena approached, the change was instantly visible in the multitude. Their eager eyes, and pauses, first of unqualified admiration, and then, their rapid gesture and articulation, soon brought a crowd about our wanderers. Harold felt his cheek glow, and even Loena, who understood not one syllable of their reiterated exclamations of—les voila! les voila!—Oh, mon Dieu! qu'elle est jolie!'—or their still more ridiculous, but respectful, and often affectionate salutations, as they kept bowing to Harold and her, with their habitual phrases, mixed with new emphasis however— of—Monsieur!—ah—Je vous salue!'—or `Mamselle! (if she smiled)—je vous mercie'—&amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.—even she could perceive that every look and motion of hers, were reflected in the surrounding countenances. She trembled, and her eyes filled. The emotion was new, indefinite, and strangely pleasurable. It was the first time that she had been publickly flattered: and her heart ran over. As for Harold, he soon recovered himself, and, in the pride of his heart, at having such a creature so near him, walked with a freer and more martial bearing. All that he did on this morning, was emphatick. His warlike and firm tread was especially regarded by the French peasantry: and the gentle, retiring diffidence of Loena, the beautiful brown girl, as they called her, to her face, bowing at the same time so complaisantly, soon became the theme of rapturous delight. Could it be otherwise? The French peasant was a soldier and a courtier by birthright. It was constitutional then, as it is now, for him to thrill, at the sight of manhood or beauty. All followed them with their eyes; and some turned back and walked after them awhile, and others approached, and appeared willing, but afraid to speak— withheld perhaps, by their natural politeness. `You tremble,' said Harold, laying his hand upon hers. Her pulse throbbed faintly, and hurriedly. `Bear up—courage—we shall soon find friends. We are now at home.' `At home!—O Harold'—Loena could not utter another word, had it been to save her own life. A tear dropped upon his hand, and her breathing became audible. It was her first experience of desolation, forlornness. So many faces, so happy, so busy, and she, a stranger! Such thoughts are terrible to a stranger, in a strange place. Man is never oppressed with such a sense of his own utter insignificance, as when he finds himself, all at once, in a large city;—and finds himself disregarded, overlooked—creating no disturbance, no curiosity—no matter who or what he may have been at home, or what he may be there, when he is known. On his first appearance, he is nothing, and the worst of it is, that he, himself, begins to submit to the treatment, as just. `These men,' he will say, `are not influenced by my reputation. They see me as I am—and they pass me, without deigning to look me in the face. Am I not contemptible?' Her feelings were sorrowful—painful. Self-sustained heretofore, by her own heart, unrebuked by her own knowledge of good and evil, she had trodden thus far, the journey of life, almost without imagining it possible that there could be any other way for woman to walk in, if she loved, than that which she had fallen upon; but she was now visited with unaccountable terrours. Her own feeling of innocence and purity was not support enough to her, she found, before the scrutinizing, impertinent looks of her own sex. A distressing study was opened to her view—Thoughts that never troubled her before, now scorched her brain, like lightning. Sensations of shame and terrour shot up, over her pale forehead, and made her temples throb. And why? Solely because the eyes of some women were upon her. She was now among strangers—a new people, whose manners were new, whose language was to be learnt. She felt subdued and restrained—a new sense of propriety came over her, and, while she almost wished herself back in the forest again, the blood of the Logans rushed back to her heart, and awoke her like electricity. Her step became, instantly, more queen like, and stately. Her fond, yielding manner, that, which solitude and an affectionate heart had taught her, gave immediate place, with the instinctive delicacy of untutored nature, whenever it is left to its own unassisted, artless prompting, to a swanlike carriage, and a calm forehead, a steady look, and a subdued tone. She released her waist from his encircling arm, and trod, with a beautiful superciliousness, that, like every attempt of an ambitious woman, was successful, and established her dominion on the spot. She blushed at the effect; but her heart danced in her bosom, in spite of herself, as she beheld the multitude, young and old, men and women, stop, as Harold passed on, and look upon him with eyes, whose smile was a blessing. A carriage was rolling past. A bell range; and the blinds were instantly let down, as it stopped in the square, through which Harold and Loena were passing. A little blue-eyed girl, with a playful, sprightly face, popped her head out, and began clapping her hands with delight. The window was instantly filled with faces. Harold passed on; but the gathering crowd prevented him from escaping immediately, and he began to feel disconcerted and distressed—nay angry; and had half a mind to unsheath his hanger, and hew his way through the thoughtless and ill-mannerly rabble. The carriage steps were let down at this moment; and a venerable man, tall and graceful, with the air of a constable, or mareschal of ancient France, a courtier of the old school, descended with a brisk action, and stood regarding Harold. Harold felt an almost irresistible desire to approach—that face!—`surely,' thought he, `I have seen it before. But it was younger then—Where was it? When?—In my childhood?' The stranger seemed unaccountably affected for a moment. His look was mingled of curiosity, astonishment and perplexity, chastened and subdued by habitual politeness and dignity. Both advanced some steps toward each other; and Harold, whose education had been consummated among the English, involuntarily advanced his hand. The governour did the same; and the little girl, who had been watching all this tedious ceremony with increasing impatience, could refrain no longer. `Oh, mon père!' she cried—`parlez—mon chèr pare—parlez lui!' The veteran advanced, and addressed Harold in English; giving him his hand, which he received, and could have kissed, for the benignity and kindness of manner, with which it was tendered. `Victorine!—ma chère—tais-toi!'—said he, to the child, seriously, but affectionately. Her eyes filled immediately; and her mother, who was at her side, gently laid her hand upon her delicate forehead—`ma chere petite—Je snis bien fache: mais—tais-toi, chere.' `My little girl is forgetful: you will excuse her, I VOL. I. Y hope. She is a spoilt child,' added the stranger, at the same time directing the carriage to proceed, while he led Harold through the crowd, that made way, on all sides, with symptoms of the profoundest respect, for them to pass. `Where have I seen you before, young man?' said the stranger, abruptly, forgetting for a moment, his habitual delicacy, in a kind of imperiousness, that indicated a haughty and impatient temper, not entirely subdued to common occasions. Harold stood proudly before him. This questioning was not to be brooked—and yet, what had he to resent? His unconquerable spirit flamed out of his eyes, for a moment, and then waned, as the second thought passed through his mind; and he replied coldly, while Loena, who had seen the portentous brightning of his aspect, with terrour, clung to him with a look of such beseeching helplessness—so soothing, so supplicating! that he must have flung her off, or he could not have resented a direct insult on himself, at the moment—very coldly, `I know not, sir. At the first moment of our meeting, I too, had a thought that we had once met, and pleasantly too. But I believe that I was mistaken.' As he said this, he bowed, and attempted to pass on. `One moment more—Stay, youth. I am not satisfied,' added the stranger, uncovering his head, and passing his hand slowly over his high, commanding front. Harold appeared troubled. His eye was fixed for a moment, upon the fine features before him, and then wandered away, with a peculiar expression of anxiety and restlessness, like one hunting, with inquietude, among the forgotten things of his early life. He was startled from his revery, by a tear—yes, a tear—it fell upon his own hand, and from his own eye, as he held the locked arm of Loena near his heart. Harold was thunderstruck. A tear! without preparation, without cause! Surely it was a rain drop. He looked up to the sky, incredulous. No—it was too blue, too serene. The drop had fallen from his own eyes. The stranger too, seemed affected in the same way. Melancholy, departed, and forgotten recollections arose and passed over his dark eyes and pale forehead, like spirits. There was a tenderness, an affectionate earnestness in his look, so opposite to his voice, when he spoke, that it went to the heart of Loena. She pressed Harold's arm. `Can you not recollect me?' said the stranger, in a tone of suppressed feeling. `No. I cannot,' was the reply. `I have somewhere seen such a countenance, and heard such a voice, before; but I cannot tell when, or where.' Several children had now gathered about our travellers, unintimidated, unrebuked by authority; and Loena was amusing them, by exhibiting what she saw attracted their little hands and eyes unceasingly, the beautiful porcupine work of her moccasin, and the magnificent, rough gold ornaments that she wore, in profusion, upon her beaver skin, and wreathed in her hair, and clasped about her arms and ancles. `Well, then. I am the governour.' Harold's countenance expressed no surprise. `You will come with me. We must be better acquainted.' Harold could not refuse. He felt like a son in the presence of his own father—obedient, with a mixture of awe and delight. It was the governour; the accomplished De Vaudreuil—a nobleman, a soldier, and a gentleman; the favourite of his queen. He drew Harold's arm within his, and proceeded, with such gentleness of deportment, that the friendless Harold could not forbear pressing the arm upon which he leaned. It was answered by a glance that shot to his heart. `Young man,' said the count, in a tone of evident pleasure. `I like this ardour. By what name am I to call thee?' `Harold.' `Harold!—Harold?—is it possible?—it is certainly very extraordinary,' he added, musing—`but thy other name?' `I have no other.' `And whom have we here,' said he, stooping, and gently laying his hand upon the shoulder of Loena, whose whole heart and soul, at the same moment, were oocupied with the mischievous little wretches about her. They were pulling and hauling her dress about, and answering the caresses of her hand, by plucking at the ornaments upon her wrist; all which she bore with her accustomed innocent good-humour. The most of these ornaments, and all indeed, which she could detach, she had already distributed among the little riflers— `whom have we here?' Her downcast eyes were raised, for a moment, to his face. But at the touch of his hand, (it was upon her naked shoulder,) they were instantly rivetted upon the earth, and she clung to Harold, trembling in all her joints, and pale as death. The count repeated the question. Her heart rebelled. The colour came and went with the rapidity of light, over her brown and intelligent countenance. He stood, gazing upon her with unaffected delight. He took her hand, and the very tears came into his eyes, as he felt it tremble in his, while she timidly raised her beautiful lids, shook back her abundant hair, which, in her romping with the children, had been turned loose upon her shoulders, and looked up in his face, with such an expression of childish, confiding simplicity; and yet, with a something of innocence, so awful, that it rebuked the passionate ardour of his countenance, as he retreated, almost in confusion. Yes, courtier as he was, such was the effect of her countenance, as she slowly lifted her head, that he went gradually to the length of all his arm, and there stood, just retaining it, with the fullest expression of respect and tenderness. `What! No answer?' said he, at length, recovering— `wife, or sister, Harold?' `Neither,' said Harold. `Neither!' echoed the count—and smiled. `Harold started as if a thunderbolt had exploded at his feet. His dark eyes flashed fire; and he sternly withdrew his arm, and turned his back, with a haughty, cold self-possession, whose rebuke was not to be mistaken by any man, and least of all men, by De Vaudreuil. A dead silence followed. Harold stood with Loena clinging to him, as if balancing whether to go or stay. De Vaudreuil smiled again; but this was not the smile that welcomed Harold—the smile of benignity— nor that which shot into his heart, the smile of significance. No!—but there was a paleness in it, and a quivering of the under lip, which Harold regarded as portentous. His hand fell upon the hilt of his sabre. But they were now, where matters of this sort were not to be decided, in a way so summary, The governour bit his lip, and added, with calmness and pleasantry—`very well, indeed! I like your spirit, sir; come, come, forgive me, (extending a hand to each.) You are strangers to our customs, and I to yours. I have my reasons for desiring to know who is your sweet companion, for I would protect you both. Your looks bespeak an elevation that I love to countenance; and for once, I will trust to looks alone; but surely!—a turn of Harold's head at the moment, caused an exclamation of astonishment to break from the lips of the governour—`By heaven! I have seen thee before!— babe, or boy.—' Harold was constrained to yield. He accepted the proffered hand, but not, till after a severe struggle with his proud, rebellious spirit. And now, he began to appreciate some of the difficulties which he was about to encounter. These were but the stepping stones; if his heart shrank at these, what would he suffer by and by! And now, for the first time, came home to him, this question. `How am I to live?' He turned thoughtfully toward the governour, and the distressing question, fell, half articulately, from his lips. The governour faced him, and pressed his hand. `Cheer up, young man,' he said. `Never despond. Never be cast down. It matters not what happens, while we are young, and in health.' `Governour,' said Harold, with a seriousness that approached to solemnity—`we are friendless. I am poor, destitute, an adventurer. My trade is fighting. This dear creature, (he trembled, and shivered all over, Y 2 but continued with a most impressive earnestness)— `This!—is—governour—this girl is a—Logan. She is indeed, a Logan—and the last!'—(he added, with a faltering voice) `we are alone, unfriended, among strangers—what shall I do?' `A Logan!' said the count—`A Logan! come with me. My own home shall be open to you. Come, come. But why does she hesitate? Is she afraid?' `We must not be separated.' The count smiled benignantly, for the dark eye of Loena repeated the thought, and her lips murmured, `we must not be separated.' Harold drew her arm more closely within his own, and with his princely head lifted up, strode along, side by side, with the governour. Loena caught the spirit. She did the same. Her carriage was princely!—the natural gracefulness of her person, undulating at every step, with a beautiful expression of intellectual power, and physical imbecility or helplessness. It was the revelation of spirit prevailing over matter. `How proudly thou walkest love,' whispered Loena. Harold was not conscious of it, but he smiled at the alteration of her presence. Every eye was upon them, and even the governour would, now and then, turn round and look at them, and utter some words of gentleness and endearment, that set them in motion, with lighter hearts and brighter eyes, as if they had been treading to musick. They soon came to the palace. The last words of Harold as they entered, were—`Loena, thou art my wife—remember that—thou art the daughter of Logan —remember that!' The operation was electrical. She stood instantly upright, her dark eyes filling with royalty; her beautiful proportions swelling and dilating with an imperial spirit. She was instantly, as by enchantment, at her ease. Her aspect and voice returned to her, and she moved and spoke, with the air of unreproved superiority. `The wife of Harold! the child of Logan!' she repeated, a thousand times to herself, while her arteries thrilled with the thought. The servants in the hall stood still with astonishment. All dusty and unprepared as our wanderers were, the governour led them forward to the family parlour, where they were all assembled at breakfast. `Your pardon,' said he, entering first. `I must announce you.' He entered, leaving the door ajar:—a few brief exclamations were heard—a general murmur, and all was silent. He returned, and threw open the door. The whole family were at table; and, as if overpowered by the presence of these children of the wood, all—all! instinctively arose, and bent, not merely their heads, but their bodies, before they recollected themselves: and then, with a general air of embarrassment, discontent, and shamefacedness, the whole, successively, sunk into their seats, as if recovering from some beautiful illusion, during which they were conscious of having exposed themselves. Their involuntary rising had been the obedience of those, who prostrate themselves, almost without looking at the object of their veneration, in the first spontaneous impulse of their hearts. It was the unqualified homage, that we must pay to nature. The little blue eyed girl, with her silken hair floating and flying all about her head, ran skipping about the floor, and clapping her hands, in a paroxysm of delight. The father looked at her, but in vain; an elder sister reproved her extreme vivacity, by a shake of the finger, but that was disregarded; and even the mother, who smiled as she chided her, found her chiding had no effect at all, until she was exhausted by her own excess of spirit. Before they could interfere, she had clambered up a sofa, thence to a table, and had just thrown her little arms about Loena's neck, and put up her pretty mouth to the blushing girl, for a kiss. She was taken down by force; but her untameable sprightliness took a new turn—she shook her redundant hair, down, all over her sweet face, and thence, peeping through it, as through a veil of unwoven, raw silk, with half opened mouth, stood watching every movement of Loena's countenance. `Ah!' she sighed at last, quite audibly, as if that were the first breath that she had drawn since Loena entered: and the timid Loena, who had, at first, shrunk from the little romp, trembling with apprehension, lest some unlucky rudeness might be perpetrated, if she had encouraged her, (for she had had some experience with forward, and petulent, and what are the worst plagues under heaven, smart children) and become grave and lofty, could resist her playfulness no longer. At the sound of this `Ah!' and seeing the arch expression of face that accompanied it, she dropped on one knee, and caught the victor to her bosom. The child jumped about her neck, looked patiently in her eyes for a moment, and then fell a kissing them, as if she would never be done; lisping all the while, between every breath, in French; `O! how beautiful they are— dear eyes—dear little eyes!' Loena blushed—and to hide her blushes, arose and romped with her about the room, ignorant that the elegant and graceful creatures about her, were admiring her attitudes, as the consummation of art. As she passed, she caught a glimpse of herself in a large mirrour—(the largest that she had ever seen, beyond all comparison)—with Harold watching her; his fine eyes and high wrought countenance, reflecting every movement of her form. How she reddened! The blood crimsoned her forehead, neck, shoulder, and bosom. Nay, she blushed all over. Harold was leaning against a group of statuary, on a high pedestal, and he looked as if he knew that she was the subject of all eyes and thoughts. A low conversation began, between two young ladies, upon a sofa on the opposite side of the room, in French; in which the father occasionally joined. It soon became exceedingly embarrassing, and Harold found it necessary to apprise the governour, that he understood the language. `Monseigneur,' said he, in a low voice, and colouring to the eyes—Je vous demand pardon; mais, il me faut—' He was interrupted, by a cry of astonishment and shame, from one of the young ladies; and De Vaudreuil, himself, appeared thunderstruck. It had never occurred to him. Harold's manners, and language, and name, were so purely English, that it was possible he understood French. The whole family were mute, for some moments, as if each were endeavouring to recal what they had been saying, in their sportiveness and admiration. `Va tú, Julie,' said the younger of the two, coaxingly, and aside, to her sister—`hablemos Espanol, un poco —no entiende.' Harold could not forbear; and the count laughed outright, as he interrupted them, with, `no, Senora—entiendo y hablo el Romance.'—`va tú diablo!' said the younger, half pouting, in a whisper.' `Encore, encore, mes filles!' said the count, to the laughing girls—`es senor del campo; y que es mejor— es Senor de se. Encore mes filles!—parlez en Italien. Il n' entend pas cela, je crois;—courage!' `Doucement, doucement—je te prie,' said the mother, delighted with the growing acquaintanceship, and unable to speak any but her own language.' `Oh! signora donna Julie,' said the mischievous creature, who seemed most to enjoy the frolick—`Siete ottimamente accompagnata,' pointing to her father.' `Si,' was the reply—`a che, son io ridotto!—ho la memoria infelice; ma, ancora, io ho piacere de non restar.' `Fo umilisscma riverenza,' said Harold, suddenly recollecting a phrase or two in Italian—`alla signora donna Julie.' A peal of laughter followed, and the ladies threw aside their work in despair, vowing that they had exhausted all their knowledge of languages, and must turn, `el hombre,' over to their father, for Latin, and Greek, and German, and Portuguese, and Dutch. `No, my children,' said the father, `I have no hope of success in so perilous an adventure. I never could string a good sentence of Greek together, with any sense of security; my Latin is rusty; I hate Portuguese and Dutch; and, as for my German, I am sure, if he know any thing at all of that language, as I think he does, by the smile that I see, I shall only expose myself in the trial. `O, but try pa!—try; do try,' cried Louise, springing from the sofa, and running forward—`do try, pa.' `Well, then, to amuse thee, child, I am willing to make one desperate attempt, at the risk of being ridiculous, if thou wilt promise not to laugh, minx, at the faces that it may cause me to make.' `Wie befinden Sie sich, mein Herr?'—said the count, with all possible gravity. `Ziemlich wohl!' was the answer—`ich danke ihnen—' and both had exhausted their knowledge of German, without being at all suspected of it.[4] [4] This will remind the reader of the story told by Barthelmie, (author of Anarcharsis' Travels,) of himself. An impostor came to him, and pronounced part of a Hebrew psalm before him. Barthelmie happened to know the other half, and replied; each had spoken all that he knew; and the spectators, nay, the impostor himself, declared Barthelmie to be a prodigy of learning. The whole family were thus, in fifteen minutes, better acquainted, than, they would have been, by many months of ceremonious intercourse. When men have once laughed together, or drunk together, they are completely acquainted. Each knows something of the other's infirmities, and is conscious of having degraded himself. Therefore, when they meet again, each is unaffected, and frank. Just at the conclusion of this ludicrous affair, an old lady, who had then entered the room, deliberately mounted her spectacles, and walked up to Harold, who shrunk back at her approach. `N'ayez pas peur, mon enfant,' said the good creature, with the kind, affectionate manner of a mother, to her own child; and putting her hand upon his forehead, at the same time—`n'ayez pas peur'—Harold retreated, covered with confusion. The laughing eyes of the young girls grew intolerable to him, while he was undergoing this examination. He fancied that they gleamed spitefully their encouragement to his persecutrix, who followed him round the room, with vehement gesture, and incessant exclamation. The old lady now hobbled away; but immediately returned, leading in an aged man, who, from his dress and respectful carriage, appeared to be a domestick of some importance: repeating, over and over again, as she entered, `Oui, oui, cest lui—j'en suis certain.' They were followed by a military-looking, middle aged man, who walked lame, but with great dignity and uprightness. The room was now darkened, by an approaching storm, and he could not distinctly see Harold, until very near him, when a flash of lightning, very bright and lasting, shone through and through him. The stranger uttered a sound of astonishment, and retreated. `Almighty God!' he exclaimed, as soon as he could speak, dropping his uplifted hands. `O, how like the chevalier!' said another, behind— `Did'nt I tell you so?' said the old lady, with a shrill voice, pressing eagerly before him. `It is his very image; is it not—Va t-en au diable!' she added, (to the servant, who stood before her.) `There!—there!—there it is!' cried De Vaudreuil, slapping his forehead. `Strange that I should not remember that. I could have sworn that I had met thee, somewhere, before, young man. Who is thy father? Nay, do not hesitate—I'll swear to it—there is no mistaking thee. Thou art of a race of heroes; men that never parleyed with dishonour. Speak! Tell me that thou art the son of the chevalier—no, the English George of—' `I am not,' cried Harold!' with a haughty and forbidding seriousness. I am only Harold, the son of an unknown man.' `No—not Harold—Auguste. He swore that he would name thee after his friend. My dear brother was that friend.' `Harold started at the sound of that name. His heart answered it. Could it be? Was he, himself, once called Auguste, or had he loved one, some playmate, in his infancy, who was so named.' `No, governour—no!' he added, after musing thoughtfully, with a distressed and anxious countenance, for some minutes. `Mine is a long story. I cannot tell it now. But my father was not—I am sure of it—he was not, he could not have been the friend of your brother.' The count looked surprised and hurt, by the apparant rudeness of this speech—`nay, do not mistake me. My father was a bad man—a terrible man. No, governour, the chevalier was another; or thou wouldst dread to meet a child of his.' `Impossible!' said the wounded veteran. At first sight, I took thee for himself, just as I saw him last;'—He stopped; for the melancholy, agitated face of Harold—the mournful steadiness of his eye, forbade all further speculation at the time. Breakfast was served again, and the constitutional politeness of a Frenchman was almost forgotten, in the intense watchfulness, with which the count regarded every emotion, and every change of Harold's face. Breakfast over, at which Loena sat, with a kind of trembling awkwardness, infinitely amusing to the younger part of the family, the governour beckoned Harold, and withdrew. Loena, who had never taken her eyes from Harold for a minute, immediately dropped the untasted goblet of milk, and rose to accompany him. De Vaudreuil smiled, and beckoning to his second daughter, Louise, in whose playfulness and waggery, he thought it most likely that Loena would find some amusement, he bade her take care of, and entertain her, as well as she could, awhile. The ladies retired; and Loena, with manifest relucance went with them. They wondered at her indelicacy, in wishing to accompany men, at such an `ungenteel hour;' and yet, there was a shrinking timidity, with all her princely bearing, that looked too like the tenderest modesty, to be any thing less amiable. `Farewell!' said she, as she lingered a moment at the door, (being the very last out, of course.) It was the first word that she had been heard to articulate audibly. Her voice, they persisted, was musick, itself; and her English, so delightful! that they were ravished with it. Harold passed her, laying his hand for a moment, gently, upon hers—a gesture too graceful, and too full of tenderness, not to excite a good deal of speculation after his departure. That touch restored her! She felt reassured and confirmed. They passed away: and when Harold next looked in upon her, he found her beleagued and beset on all sides, with half a dozen children, little and big, all chattering together, and trying to make her comprehend the meaning and intention of all the playthings, bandboxes, jewelry, and dresses, with which the floor and furniture were covered. Louise was teaching her to jump the rope. Marie was racing after her with a battledore—the blue eyed Victorine was dancing round her with a great waxen doll, nearly as big as herself; and Pierre Jacques, the only boy in the family, and just old enough to be a plague to every body within his reach, was for flying a kite in her face. Here was my lady's maid, coaxing her into a beautiful dress, with Spanish hat and feathers; and there was my young lady's woman, making faces at the unshorn, glossy, luxuriant tresses of nature, and lamenting with continual emphasis, that they should be suffered to run about so rudely, without powder or pomatum. The governour and Harold, and even Loena herself laughed, at the ridiculous figure that she cut, huddled up among such a world of trumpery, the very existence of which she was unconscious of, until she was assured that it was all, so indispensable, that there was no existing without it; all which she believed, as soon as she understood it. Thus passed the morning. In the afternoon, while the governour and Harold were sitting in the hall, and enjoying the magnificent prospect below, the door suddenly opened, and their old Indian guide, whose unceremonious disappearance had caused Harold some little inquietude at first, stalked in, with his son, and two other Indians. VOL. I. Z The governourwas forcibly struck with the difference between them and Harold. Their very tread was a signal of submission: his, of defiance. He carried command in his forehead; they, subjection. He walked like a prince; they, like slaves. He, like the undegenerate Indian; they, like the scorned and derided of white men. The very children observed this difference, and shrank from the new comers, with abhorrence, contempt, and loathing. Their feelings were too obvious, too inartificial, too innocently revealed, at once, to leave the matter, for a moment, in dispute—and yet, so lost were the reviled ones, so utterly, to all the heroick confidence of their race, that, instead of turning upon their scoffers, and rebuking them to dust, with the majesty of their awakened countenances, they forbore to express aught of their feeling; they trembled and quailed before the merriment of babes; the very babes of white men, with the look and carriage of helpless insignificance—patient, and fearful. Shame on them! Not so Harold. He stood erect—his dark locks lying broadly on his Grecian forehead, and clustering thickly about the back of his head, in short, strong, matted curls—his neck and shoulders, and chest, partially exposed—charactered with strength, and breadth, and fullness, as well as beauty—with a golden laced military undress, of the most brilliant scarlet, made of European materials, but after the Indian manner, under the ample and shining folds of the beaver mantle— forming, altogether, a noble and spirited picture, as of a young Scythian, clad in his own spoils—a young barbarian, returning with the habiliments of a slain enemy. The old Indian, alone, came forward, unintimidated, frankly and intrepidly: and offered his aged hand to the governour, with the expression of perfect equality. But, perceiving, at the same time, the embarrassment of his attendants, and their scowling awkwardness, he reddened, and uttered a few rapid words, with an air of authority, which they instantly obeyed, by leaving the room. The governour received him with unaffected cordiality and respect: and the old Indian told him, as well as he could, in a mixture of broken English, French, and his own dialect, that Harold was going to England. `To England!' quoth the governour, shaking his head—`No. no, not if I can help it.' A long conversation ensued; in which Harold explained all that he thought necessary of his purpose and hope. `You have great influence, I believe, with the Indians?' `Yes—decidedly—great,' answered Harold. `They are willing to be led by me, now—but I am not qualified to lead them, yet, as I would wish.' `What is your plan?' `To fit myself for a captain and statesman, in the schools of Europe; to return; to establish a confederacy among all the tribes of America—wrench back a part of our possessions from the English—and prevent all further encroachment.' `Boy!' cried De Vaudreuil, his eyes sparkling with enthusiasm—`Boy! I glory in thee. Thou art fitted for this. None but a hero could think of such a scheme. Give me thy hand. I pledge myself, this moment, to assist thee, heart and soul, sword and purse. My king shall assist thee, too. Our English neighbours are getting too formidable—they are breaking in upon our chain of fortifications upon the frontier. We must, we will drive drive them back to their entrenchments.' Harold looked this wily politician in the face, steadily, for some moments. `Governour!' said he; `I accept the pledge. I give myself up to you, without reserve or qualification. But mark me—I have a natural antipathy to the whites, and so have all my countrymen. Beware then, how you put such power into my hands, unless you believe your people capable of continuing, as they have begun, fair traders, faithful allies, and honest purchasers of our territory. At the first symptom of treachery or oppression, I will turn my hand against you.' `Me!' `Yes—even you, governour! though I would rather die.' `Very well,' said the governour, smiling at his ardour, though his blood ran cold, when he saw the settled look of determination, with which the purpose was so boldly announced. It was devout, deadly, and unsparing. Harold continued to explain his views; and De Vaudreuil listened with astonishment. His observations were profound and rational: evincing an intimate familiarity with all the French possessions, from Louisiana to Quebec; and he almost dreaded to put such an engine in motion. The thundering of its wheels and cylinders, and chains, would not easily be stayed again, he was sure. `You are young, brave, resolute, and of a military turn, Harold. I am willing to believe, therefore, that you can do incredible things. Nay, when I look upon you, and hear you, nothing seems impossible, that you meditate. Will you stay with me? I will take care of you.' `Governour, I am resolved to take care of myself. I have lived too long in dependance.' As he said this, he raised his arms—and the passionate nature of the boy broke out, all at once, like flame, in his scornful countenance—a withering and blasting flame. The count, carried away by his feelings, embraced him on the spot. `Thou shalt go, my young hero!' he said; `thou shalt! to England, France, whither thou wilt. I will be thy friend—thy father—go where thou wilt, and when.' Harold's eyes filled. This was unexpected kindness. All else he could have resisted. Of late, he was so unaccustomed to the voice of manly encouragement, that the slightest tone went thrilling to his heart. Such was his nature. He that could withstand, sternly and forever, the assaults of the unkind—the wind and the rain of heaven—encasing himself in adamant, as they beat upon him, and wrapping the protection of his great nature in more impenetrable folds, about and about him, threw it off—unharnessed—uncased—abandoned all his armour, and stood, naked, and trembling from head to foot, when the sunshine of affection shone out upon him. `Governour!' said he, at last, nearly suffocated by his emotion—`governour—'(the governour was shocked and alarmed at the deeply broken voice—the suppressed breathing of Harold—they were indicative of such tremendous inward agitation)—`governour—I thank you!' It was all that he could say—all that he dared to say, without weeping. It was enough. The count saw that he was choking; and Harold felt, at that moment, as if every evil passion of his convulsed, disincumbered heart, had fled forever: as if all its greenness and poison had been neutralized by a few tears, and all its hatred and malignity, risen and passed off, as in distillation. Its bitterness was no longer to be tasted, as it had been, burning and acrimonious, as the venom of the rattlesnake, when he thought of his indignities, and the wrongs of his people. And the count, himself, felt, in the protracted utterance of these few simple words, `I thank you,' a full assurance that Harold would abide the trial, and live to requite all that had dared to stand by him, when he was unfriended, trampled on, belied, and alone. `God bless thee, my boy!' was the fervent ejaculation of De Vaudreuil, in reply, his very spirit flaming out of his eyes. What was this strange enthusiasm? Whence was it? A young stranger, an Indian, swarthy and repulsive, haughty and forbidding in his aspect, but stands up before another stranger, an aged man, a nobleman, a soldier, and a courtier; accustomed for a score of years to having his passions assailed, in vain, by the mightiest and craftiest—and, straightway, the latter is his friend, body and soul, to the spilling of blood? Verily, all things are possible to the young and valiant! It was the electrick communication of proud hearts, hearts beating with chivalry. De Vaudrueil was a soldier; one of the tried and graceful ones of France—a nation of young knights! And his heart leaped in his bosom, at the trumpet toned voice of young Harold. It was the Z 2 first neighing of a youthful steed, in his impatience for the trial, when his voice sounds as if his arteries are ruptured with the effort. `But what are we to do with her?' said the governour, pointing to a distant room, where sat the pale girl, in a drooping, disconsolate attitude—smiling, in her abstraction, upon the children, who were striving to amuse her, with a sweet, desolate smile. `Her!' answered Harold, his brow knitting, and his lip writhing, entirely forgetful of his newly proffered allegiance, as he observed the tone of doubtful hesitation and distrust, in which the inquiry, to his anxious hearing, appeared to be made. `Her!' what mean you, governour?—the princess—' `Aye,' said the count, laughing—aye, my hot spark, the princess. What are we do with her, when you are gone?' `When I am gone!—what! Think you, I would go alone—think you that I could? No, governour—no! Go where I will, she goes with me. We go together, or we stay together. Nay, not even that—go we will, and together, and over the wide water too, if we have to swim for it.' `Bravo!' said De Vaudreuil, shaking his hands heartily. But his purpose of separating them, nevertheless, did not change. It was essential to all his plans, that Harold should go unincumbered, and that he should hold some check upon him during his absence; and he determined to study the character of Loena, thoroughly, before he revived the subject. He soon found not only the family, but the very servants, inconceivably interested in her. And before another week had passed, it was determined among them, to retain her, educate her, and hold her in the bosom of their own family, until Harold should return. In this determination, there were compounded all the feelings of a man, a father, and a consummate politician. The power which Loena had over the prejudice and reverence of the red men, as the child of a Logan, and the only one left, was not to be lightly disregarded. With Harold's assistance, she might be made to effect, what all the missionaries and emissaries, (terms nearly synonimous, however, at all times,) of his master had only dared to contemplate; namely, the ultimate expulsion of the English from their new possessions, and their confinement to the shores of the Atlantic. The subject was renewed. Harold had considered it, with an aching heart, but coolly and dispassionately. His head hung upon his bosom, and he finally consented that Loena herself should determine whether to go or stay. By her decision, he would abide. But another season had passed—and another, before she was tried. Her artlessness had captivated all hearts: her earnestness to please, her uncorrupted purity, her docility, her unaffected dignity and grace, under the most embarrassing emergencies, when a delicate instinct, supplying the part of all experience, made her very ignorance charming: her strange, wild, troubled beauty, continually changing from meekness to fire; from melancholy to enthusiasm, from submission to authority— and the unaffected corruscations of character that broke out, continually, in collision, from their dark hiding places, like the sudden lights of bedded diamonds, broken and shattered in the trampling of iron hoofs. All these things had soon become a study and a delight, nay, an employment, for the whole of De Vaudreuil's household. They could not have parted with her. This reluctance increased, as they discovered her acquaintance with the principles of their own sublime religion, (the Catholick.) She was not told that Harold had consented. The very thought would have shaken her to the earth with apprehension. But why did he consent? Did he believe it possible that she would? No; but he flattered himself that his manly purpose, the result of deliberate reasoning, which had convinced him of the rash impropriety that there would be in taking a helpless Indian girl along with him, into such jeopardy and vicissitude as he must necessarily encounter, would be entirely overthrown by the first movement of Loena, without any weakness in himself. The desire of being with him, he knew to be a constantly active principle with her— nay, that was vitality to her. Thus Harold was content to appear like a man, and a stoick, because he knew that the Indian maid would not permit him to act like one. Oh, no!—and this was his only hope; for he dreaded, even when he testified his submissiveness to her will, a separation, more than death. How little he knew her! How widely he mistook his own influence, and the influence of accustomed endearment over her! Hitherto she had been among men only. Her heroick nature had met with no rivalry. She had been absolute; and she had walked and wandered, whither she would, in her own dominion, unreproved, unrebuked, unreproached. But now, she was beset with a new and strange inquietude—a new sense; a scrupulous, delicate wakefulness to propriety. She had become prouder too of him, for she saw the young Indian walking proudly, before the proudest white men; men who had been, hitherto, so very terrible to her nation; and she naturally thought more highly of herself, for being beloved by one so considerable. It was only required to set her own powerful and beautiful mind at work, and the rich element, once in commotion, would teem, of its own will and activity, with proportion, and loveliness, and wisdom. This, with the assistance of his lady, the count soon discovered, to be the character of the princess, as the whole family now persisted in calling her, in spite of her remonstrances, when she found how lofty a title it was. It hurt her innocent and unambitious heart, to rank higher, even in phraseology, than her protectors, the count and countess. One morning, as the count entered the parlour, he discovered his wife employed in trimming the hair of Loena into a thousand fantastick undulations. Now she would persist in giving her the picturesque and beautiful aspect of a Greek girl—and now, she would toss it wildly over her temples and bosom, till she resembled some terrified Bacchante. His own daughters sat, laughing and pouting by her side, occasionally interfering, and squabbling about the gracefulness and effect of this cluster, or that waving, luxuriant mass, that flowed, as if it were liquid silk, over her shoulders. He laid his parental hand upon Loena's head, and put his lips to her forehead. She coloured, but seized his hand, and blessed him with that fervour, that innocent and natural fervour, which is not to be counterfeited or affected. Her emotion choked her. The conversation, so long dreaded, was soon began; and the countenances of all grew more and more serious, mournful, sad, as he proceeded, until there was not a dry eye in the room. A frigate was to sail the same evening for Calais— Harold was to depart in her. `Harold!' faintly articulated the gasping girl, and shut her eyes. `Harold!' echoed all the others. The word died away on their lips. They all clung to poor Loena, with hands and mouths, as she buried her face in the lap of the countess. A sad presentiment sat heavily upon her heart. So much admonition—so much advice—so much gentle insinuation—so many new feelings and thoughts about propriety, conjured up—it could not be for slight purposes. Yet what was she to fear? They were to go together— together! were they?—oh yes—but then he said Harold—Harold only.' `I will go!' she exclaimed, starting upon her feet, forgetful of their presence. `I will go with him, the wide world over! Let me see who shall dare to oppose me! Harold! come thou to my defence!' They had been watching every movement; and De-Vandreueil now left the room, saying to his wife, significantly, that he left Loena to her care. `Oh!' said the countess, after a few moments of mournful silence, while the dim eyes of the Indian girl were searching out the mystery of this behaviour, with a look of unutterable expostulation—`Oh'—(as if she that moment recollected herself) oh, how long is it, my dear—' (she stopped a moment, for she found it exceedingly difficult to make herself intelligible to Loena, whose early lessons in French, were but just beginning to revive—besides, she was startled at her own abruptness, and inwardly awed at the calm melancholy, the beautiful self-possession that arose gradually upon the youthful countenance before her—as if to rebuke all particular inquiry—(so much for her lessons in propriety) but her lip trembled, and she pressed the hand of the countess, and put her mouth meekly upon the blue veins, as if conscious that this was not the time for the princess to be seen—no! but for the woman, the tender and impassioned woman alone. A tear fell upon the hand. She stooped with her luxuriant tresses, and would have wiped it away, but her mother, (for thrice had the lady called her `daughter,' and her heart yearned to show its sensibility to the endearing relationship)—her mother forbad it, and dismissed the girl and children, with her hand. `I am abrupt, love,' she said, `I know that I am; but thy frank nature is accustomed to that. Thou art a woman, a young, inexperienced, and enthusiastick woman. I tremble for thee—Here thou hast come, a stranger, my child, an innocent, unfriended, unsupported, helpless stranger—among strangers—(Loena's eyes overflowed) with no brother—no father—no sister—not even one of thy nation—(Loena attempted to speak) what sayest thou, love?—nay, do not weep.' Poor Loena sobbed as if her heart would break. The countess continued—`no father—no mother. Oh, yes thou hast. I will be thy mother, my sweet girl. Wilt thou be my daughter?' `I will, O, I will,' faintly whispered the fainting girl. Bid me as thou wilt—I will do thy bidding—my mother—my dear, dear mother!' The countess embraced her passionately. The contact was inconceivably affecting to both. Loena felt as if her own mother had risen from the grave; and the countess, as if caressing her youngest born, the child of her old age. Behold them!—a beautiful woman—a French woman—a Parisienne, locked to the bosom of a young American—an Indian girl, brown, and sparkling with barbarian ornament—locked too, as a mother and daughter, in overwhelming and inexpressible tenderness. It was the union of ministering intelligences—the priesthood of loveliness among the oppressors and the oppressed. Fashion and Nature; the perfection of Art, and the simplicity of unadulterate, uncontaminate Nature! `My daughter, compose thyself,' continued the countess,' lean awhile on me—the bosom of thy mother— why, how thy temples throb, child—and the sweat, I declare, thy hair is wet, on thy forehead, with it. Verily, verily, but thou art fearfully and wonderfully made. We are all so—woman is, at best, but frailly, delicately constituted, but thou art so, in an especial manner— more a thing of intellect and nerve, and spirit, than aught that I know, even among women. Come, come, cheer up, and prepare thyself. Thy heart too, why it is coming through thy side!' `It feels, mother, as if it would, indeed,' answered the trembling girl, as she shook back her redundant hair, and looked up in her face, with a quivering lip, and a pale, very pale cheek—`It feels, mother, as if it were nothing but ashes—O, it is dry, pulverised— there is no moisture in it—I would weep—but I cannot weep—I cannot shed another tear. But go on, my mother, O, how it delights me to pronounce the strange word—ma mère! ma mère!—I am prepared.' Saying this, she arose, and sat upright: upheld and sustained, by her own unconquerable spirit. Now was to be the trial. She was sure of it. She knew not what was coming, but whatever it was, she was now ready to face it. The countess dreaded to begin, now that the moment had come. `Hast thou known Harold long?' said she, at last, with solemnity. `From my very infancy, ma mère.' `Constantly; with no interval?' `None—yet stay—O, yes, ma mère, there was a dreary interval. I remember it now—I hate to think of it. I thought that I had forgotten it—he wandered—' `Loved another, perhaps?' `What!—he—he! Harold—he love another! O, no— no—no—ha!—ha!—ha!' She laughed deliriously, and shuddered, as her voice died away on her lips, and the echo came back to her, `ha! ha! ha!' What shook her so? Was this the first pang of jealousy, to the brown girl of the wilderness? What shook her so? She had heard tales, but she did not believe them. She had traced them to the old Indian, but inadvertently; and she disdained to ask Harold if they were true; nay, she almost scorned herself for thinking of them for a moment.' `He is going to England,' continued the countess. `Yes, ma mère.' `Thy mother was—' `O, name not my mother!—O, name not that blessed one!' `Didst thou love her, dear?' `Love her!—love my mother!—ask her!—call her hither!—call her down from heaven!—Bid her tell thee! O, my mother, my mother! did I love thee? Gracious heaven!—did I love my own mother?' `I do not doubt thee, Loena, dearest: But I ask thee for especial purposes. How old wast thou when she was taken away?' `Fourteen springs.' `Hadst thou learned to read?' `A little—a very little.' `Did thy mother ever talk to thee of the customs abroad; of marriage, religion, delicacy, propriety?' `Of marriage and religion, she did; of delicacy and propriety, never. She had no occasion for it. I have learnt their meaning only since I came here—the words, I mean. I have been familiar with the actions, which they denote, from my childhood. It was the religion of my blessed mother, to be modest. She made us innocent and sincere. Here, I have learnt, that to be modest, innocent, and sincere, is not enough. We must appear so, and to strangers:—and that, pardon me, lady, but it seems to me, that here it is better to appear so, and not be so, than to be so, and not appear so.' `Did she love Harold?' `Yes, as the apple of her eye.' `Did she ever interfere, or restrain your childish frolicks?' `Restrain us! no. Together we clambered the mountain—together buckled on our quivers, and hunted the red deer together—swam the torrent together—together wrestled, played, and toiled together—and slept together, in each other's arms. Restrain us! no. Why should she? It would have made us miserable. And her whole study was to make us happy—she was our mother. Nay, she held us together in her arms, and bade me love Horold—and bade him protect me, through all peril, temptation, and vice. We have done so. Restrain us—no, indeed.' `These were the feelings of thy childhood. What are they now?' `Now, oh, I know not. I do not love Harold now, as I did. I am afraid of him. I tremble when I hear his step. I know not why it is; but I cannot bear to sport with him now—not even to touch him—nay, if he come near me, I am ready to fly from him. And yet, I am so unhappy when he is away; and still, he is dear, very dear to me.' She hid her face in her mother's bosom. `And when did these emotions first assail thee? this change?' `After we were separated the first time. I loved him before. I would have laid down my life for him, before. But then, I never trembled, never wept before him. I could bear to speak to him, and could understand what he said in reply: but now I cannot. He talks to me, but I never answer, for I cannot understand him. I only hear his voice. It thrills through and through me, and I could fall asleep, while I am listening to it, as I would to unknown musick. If he speak suddenly now, to me, there is a confused ringing in my ears. Is it not very strange? I am afraid, mother,' (she added, in a low whisper) I am afraid that I don't love Harold now, as I ought.' `Loena—look at me—wouldst thou swim with him, now?' VOL. I. A a `Yes, certainly—why not?' `Wouldst thou sleep with him, as thou didst in childhood?' `Would I? Certainly I would. Did I not, all the way through the wilderness?' `Dear innocent,' said the countess, kissing her, with full eyes, and a smiling lip. But Loena's countenance underwent a change. She appeared troubled, pensive, thoughtful—She raised her head. The working of her soul began to betray itself— `Mother,' said she—a slight tinge of red, the slightest in the world, passing over her forehead, and her fringed lids dropping—`Mother, I never thought of this before—no—no—I could not swim with Harold now. And never shall lie with him again.' `Why not, my dear?' said the countess, willing to prosecute the whimsical inquiry. It was so delicious to watch the first contracting and dilating of a pure heart —naked and transparent before her—palpitating with its own heat. `Indeed, I know not; except that just now, when I said I would, ma mère looked so surprised! I was frightened. And then, the other day, when I happened to mention how diverted I used to be when Harold talked in his sleep, Louise asked me a very strange question, and when I answered—' `What was it, my dear?' Why, whether I was married?—only think!—and then, when I laughed and told her no, she turned red, and fell a whispering with her sister, and I thought she was less cordial to me, ever afterward; and so, I am afraid that there must be something wrong in what I said. I ought to keep my thought a secret, ought I not, ma mère. Now, don't be angry with me.' The countess was irresistibly diverted with her simplicity. But she took her throbbing hands, and said, as she pressed them in her own—' `My child—Harold must leave thee.' `Leave me!—me!' screamed Loena. The countess, herself, shrieked, at the wildness and suddenness of her exclamation. It was a cry of delirium—as from some childless mother—`Leave me!— Harold!—me!' `Hush hush,' my dear girl, they are coming. (The steps passed away.) Now hear me. Harold is going away. (Loena gasped for breath.) Thou art a woman. He is a man. He is not thy brother, nor thy husband— nor even a kinsman—wilt thou go with him alone?' `Aye lady, aye! all the world over. Aye, to the abode of darkness!' she continued, without raising her eyes, `to the green earth—to the cold northern sky! Brother, husband, father, clansman—all, all, is Harold to me! I abjure all the world for him. To him, and him alone, will I forever cling, in my desperation. I will, I will! nothing shall separate us. I am desolate enough now, but I should be dead, dead, in my desolation, were he away. No—I tremble to be with him, but I cannot, will not, be separated. I cannot bear his voice, but I should die, perish, go utterly mad, were I where I could not hear it. I cannot touch him; but he may be sick—sick, lady, in a strange land, and who shall nurse him, then?—who shall hold his hot forehead —wipe off the sweat, and spread the beaver for his cabin—who?—O, I should die if any other touched him. If I may not, O withered and accursed be the hand that soothes him—I should hate her forever and ever.' `Her! my dear—whom do you mean?' `The woman that should go to Harold's cabin when I was away.' `My child! my child! this must not be. Wouldst thou, poor innocent, thou!—go alone with a man, the wide world over; unsanctioned, unblessed?' `Aye, lady, the wide world over! What care I for your Christian ceremonies? We love, and God, God, himself, will say a blessing for us, the first time that we are alone upon the waters! Think you, that we shall not sleep as soundly in each other's arms, dreaming and embracing, innocently and fervently, and devoutly, too—yea, religiously—for we have our religion!—like the man and woman of Paradise—as if we had been kneeling down to the benediction of mortal man, a poor child of infirmity and sorrow, like ourselves—No, no! We are wedded, wedded already, heart and soul. He is my husband, and I am his wife.' `My child, my child! what will become of thee? A beggar—an outcast—helpless—suppose he should die, Loena—Yea, shudder, my child; such a thing may be. Wilt thou go?' `I will.' `Can nothing disturb thee?' `Nothing.' `And art thou, canst thou so forget thy blood— thine ascendancy. Thou! daughter of Logan?' `What!—what is that, lady!—Logan! who spake of Logan?—O speak again—speak, I conjure thee!' `Daughter of Logan,' said the countess, with the most impressive solemnity, while Loena stood as if rooted to the spot—`I knew thy mother. Nay, it is true. Another day, and I will tell thee all. I was a prisoner once, and she saved my life; and that of a child of mine, who is now dead. Thy mother now speaks to thee. Her commands are imperative. Go thou not with Harold! Thou art a princess, an Indian princess. Thou knowest him not. He is young, fiery, and irresolute; wait awhile. Thou art to be the saviour of the Indians. Be thou the companion of some hero. Be Harold himself, that hero. He is the apostle of Ambition. But first learn thine own value. Try his constancy. Be not easily won, and cast aside, like that poor creature—Ah, thou hast not forgotten her, I see— Nay, nay, do not grasp my neck so tightly, dear; thou wilt strangle me. Think of her, Loena. Men are always the same. Let Harold go alone—alone. If he be worthy of thee, and thy heritage, he will return; and thou, my dear child, wilt be assured of his sincerity and truth. What is thy determination?' `I know not. I am of the blood of Logan. I feel that tingling in all my blood vessels. That poor girl! No, no, I will not, cannot be like her—broken hearted, and so pale!—O, Harold! Harold! couldst thou?—no, no, thou couldst not. And I could curse myself for thinking of it. Art thou not, in truth, all purity to me? all gentleness? terrible as thou seemest. Let me go, mother. At what hour does the great canoe depart?' `At sunset—his baggage is already on board.' `At sunset!' echoed Loena, faintly. `Before that hour I shall be prepared. I tremble now.' She withdrew, and the countess watched her from the window, as she saw her move, with a hurried and agitated step, up the acclivity through the garden, to where she could see the sails, and the water. Her step faltered. She stood alone. She knelt. A large tree overshadowed her, and her attitude was that of a Christian girl at her supplication, broken down, and bowed—She stretched out her arms to the water, and bent her head. She arose—her beautiful drapery, newly modelled after the antique of a bronze dancing girl, was blowing about her. She retreats—why so fast?— She conceals herself—She stoops, as if half willing to be seen. What significance of motion! Thus much of coquetry had she already learnt. While her heart bounded to meet some loved one, she hung back timidly! O children of the mountain, how are ye worn, and wasted, and degenerate, upon the plain! No—she is in earnest. How erect she stands! What beautiful loftiness—so concentrated. A man!—a French officer!—ah, he approaches her. What awes him so?— No further—not one step—and yet, he advanced at first, familiarly enough—stay, he gathers courage—he approaches her. `Insolence!' cried the countess, with burning cheeks, and rang the bell, with passionate violence. The officer had thrown his arm round the Indian maid—what! Is she feeling for a weapon?—merciful heaven! he is hurled to the earth! A lion is upon him! An apparition! `O heaven! O heaven! spare him! spare him!' shrieked the countess, as she threw up the window, in horrour and consternation. * * * * Great God! It is too late—he is going—I see him—I hear him—help! help!—there! there!' The servants passed the window. Their exhausted A a 2 lady could but just raise her hand, and point. They looked up, and leaped forward, like madmen, to the rescue. `Ah—it is all over!' said the countess, a moment after, letting the window fall, and sinking upon the floor —`Ah!—Oh! his blood is spirting upon me—hot!— hot!—and see, see,' she added, as her female attendants, alarmed at the outcry, filled the room—holding out her hands, and stretching her fingers apart, and shuddering—`see! see—his torn flesh!—his brains— reeking—reeking!' Another moment, and Harold burst into the room, bearing the triumphant Loena upon his bosom, which was half-buried in her abundant, and disordered tresses; while hers was half revealed, in its beautiful undulations, through her torn dress. Harold began an explanation, but was interrupted by a clamour at the door. He anticipated the result. He unsheathed his cymetar—it rang, and whistled, as he drew it forth, with the accustomed flourish, as if impatient for service; and those who stood near, shrunk back, as it flashed by them; breathlessly looking upon the fierce and fell, the wrathful and settled composure of his countenance. Death was in every lineament: yet in every lineament was a mortal and unutterable fixedness. It was terrible. The noise increased. There was a clamorous outcry for `the Indian—the Indian—the murderer!' Harold moved toward the door. The countess forbade him: but Loena bade him go—go, and beat back the rabble herd, and not suffer the dwelling of his benefactor to be profaned. He obeyed. He threw open the door; but De Vaudreuil was already rebuking them, with a drawn sword in his hand, and promising them justice. In the mean time, the sails were heaved upward— bent in the setting sun—persons and boats were seen running hither and thither, in the bustle of departure; and the mob were soon occupied, in their fickleness, with the scene. The count turned his attention to his lady, and soon heard from her, all the particulars of the affair. A broken sword, and a rent scarf were ample testimonials of the fierceness of the combatants; but the leap, to which Harold had compelled the wounded man, from the precipice, was soon found not to have been fatal. He had fallen upon the top of a slightly built summer house, in a garden below, and escaped, with only a dislocated shoulder; a wound in his side; and a few bruises, for his presumption. He was to have gone in the very vessel with Harold, and had ascended the hill for a last look at the picturesque scenery, when his impetuous and headlong folly had well nigh cost him his life. His fate was deserved. He was driven to the precipice, and thence, shricking, with a strong, unsparing hand, was thrust down. Harold and Loena remained locked in each other's arms. This new danger had endeared them, if it were possible, more than ever, to each other. Their tears and kisses were mingled. `I am going, Loena,' said Harold. `Am I to go alone?' `I cannot, cannot answer thee,' said she; `What shall I say? I am a woman. Ought I to go? What wouldst thou, Harold, dear Harold, that thine own sister should do, at such an hour? By thy soul, I conjure thee!—declare unto me, thy true thought—and—so help me heaven, in my utmost need!—I will abide by it—go, or stay—be with thee, or apart, forever and ever—as thou shalt now judge me?' Harold sank upon his knee: held her to his heart; heard her sobbing above him; sobbing aloud—felt her heart beating against his cheek, as if it would burst its cell. What did he? Harold was a hero; but Harold was human: Godlike, he might be, but his true nature was humanity. What did he, in this hour of trial? He bade her stay—aye, by heaven and earth, that Indian boy had the courage and heart, the heroick courage, and the greatness of heart, to speak honestly, and bid her stay! Again and again, they embraced, convulsively—parted and wept—and blessed each other, over and over again. `I obey,' said Loena. `But think not, countess, mother, that it is to try his faith—oh, no! of that, I cannot doubt—why Harold, love—how deadly pale thou art.' She remained looking at him, a moment; and then, coming nearer, added, `I have been provoked to try a spell upon thee, before thou goest—nay—smile—do smile—we shall soon meet again. Shall we not, mother? Shall I try it, mother?' The countess nodded in the affirmative. Harold trembled from head to foot. `Nay, it is only a name. Don't be so frightened.' Her voice and countenance instantly changed—`but it may be true—gracious god! it may be—Harold, look at me—' (She placed her hands upon his shoulders, and looked him intently in the eyes—his lips were bloodless—) `Elvira!' she said; and, at the instantaneous change of his countenance, hers fell—her hands dropped down, and she stood, as if struck with sudden death. At this moment, a flash, like a wide, thin, and suddenly diffused vapour, whitened the opposite wall. It was the last sail! A peal of thunder followed. It was the signal gun! `Once more! once more, Loena,' cried Harold, approaching her, and extending his arms to her. She shook her head in silence. His forehead reddened. He turned to depart. He had shaken hands with all, and embraced the count and countess, and was going. Loena never moved, nor spoke. Harold could not bear it. He went to her. `Loena,' he said, tenderly, and solemnly—`Loena. Look at me once. I cannot part with thee—it may be—forever, thus.' She turned—but her countenance was fixed. `Speak to me, once more, before we part forever— I cannot leave thee, thus. O, speak to me! What of Elvira?—It is nearly three years since I saw her.' At that name, she started and shrieked—pressed her hands distractedly to her forehead—came to him, once more—laid her face upon his bosom—fell upon her knees, and called upon him `O, Harold! Harold—thou, whom I thought so pure —O, is it true?' `What, love?' `I cannot speak it?—the hateful thought. O, how I have derided and scorned it. Is it true? O, tell me— tell me, or I shall die at thy feet!' `Hast thou not read my letter?' `What letter?' The count here interfered, taking a large pacquet from his bosom, and saying. `No, my son, I thought it best to defer it till you had gone. Your parting ought, at least, not to be in sorrow: still less in bitterness—but here it is.' `No, no! I want no letters, no pacquets—none! I only want him to speak! Let me hear thy voice, Harold. Answer me—is it true?—one word! one word, dear Harold!' `I know not what thou wouldst ask, dearest of women. All I know, is, that that letter, which I wrote last night, for thee, was intended to assist thee in thy decision about going with me. It contains the history of my whole life; all my transgressions—all my crimes. I should have told thee, love, but I feared that thou mightest be influenced by my presence, to forgive me, in spite of thyself—or, perhaps, fly from me, into the wilderness. I have left it now—now—that thou mayest know me, entirely, with all my infirmities, and decide upon me, by thyself, alone, before it be too late.' `Harold! thou hast broken my heart—one word I ask for—only one word—and that thou deniest me— answer me—thou knowest what I mean—whom I mean —art thou innocent?' Harold shuddered at her calmness. `And suppose I tell thee that I am; wilt thou believe me, Loena? canst thou take my simple word?' said he. `Believe thee!—oh, God, yes—yes—though all the angels in heaven, swore against thee—believe thee, Harold!—O, but raise thy hands now, as I do mine—but lay them upon mine—and say to me, Loena, I am innocent, of that one offence—I am innocent—and I will forgive thee, all others—all!—my own blood—ah, speak, speak to me, Harold—do speak—they are but three, poor, simple words—and they will make thy wretched girl so happy!—O, say, Loena, I am innocent—say so, dear, and I will fall down and worship thee.' `Loena,' said Harold, in a sepulchral voice—he shut his eyes, and his lips were covered with froth—`Loena!' (She stood as if her very soul were about to take wing, forever.) `I am not innocent.” She fell flat upon her face, without sense or motion. Harold ran to her, lifted her up, but no sign of life appeared. Another gun!—he turned deliriously—lifted up his arms. A hollow groan broke from him. `Show me to the water,' he said, sternly, with shining eyes. The count took his arm, and they walked, nay, almost ran to the shore. The boat was ready—the sailors gave three cheers—Harold shook the governour's hand, muttering continually in a low voice—`no, no, not innocent—dead—dead—very well—to meet again —a falsehood would have saved her—no matter. Governour, farewell—farewell, forever!' and leaped into the boat. The governour stood and watched him. He sat with his arms hanging over in the water—motionless, and abstracted, as despair—hearing nothing—seeing nothing—doing mechanically, what his preservation required him to do, as the sharp boat, heeled under the weight of the rowers, shipping water at every pull, and splashing the cold spray into his bosom and face, unheeded. He saw them arrive—he saw Harold ascend—his eyes filled; and he returned with a heavy heart to his own distracted family.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XVI. `Jam dulces lachrymæ, dolorque festus.' `Der seble Tag, der mich der welt. Als Pilgrim, oder Gast gegeben.' `Ho!—Enihi! enihi—bestertha enihi!' `Bound where thou wilt, my Barb, and glide my prow; `But—be the star that guides the wanderer, Thou! `Day after day—day after day, We felt nor breath nor motion; As idle as a painted ship, Upon a painted ocean.' `Alone—alone!—all, all, alone— Alone!—on a wide, wide sea!' Woman! couldst thou have left the dead body of one whom thou hadst loved, as Harold left Loena? But he left her, nor paused, nor looked behind him, till he stood upon the deck of the vessel. His eyes were motionless, and the busy activity of the crew, the parting of friend after friend, over the side of the ship; the waving of hands, handkerchiefs—the sound of sobs and farewells, were all unheard, unseen, by Harold. There was only one voice, to which his heart could echo. That was mute. There was only one touch that he could feel—and she that might have given it, in a farewell murmur—where was she? He shuddered. He turned toward the city. A scarlet flag was waving from the highest window in the governour's house. `Oh, I am not forgotten!' he cried—`not quite the accursed, and forgotten one! even yet there is some kind heart to remember me—God bless thee for it! whoever and whatever thou art, gentle creature'—his eyes filled, and the horrible tightness of his chest abated. `God bless thee!' he continually repeated—he started —some one was breathing over his shoulder. It was De Vaudreuil. He gave him a bundle of letters—embraced him, once more in silence, and descended to his barge. The water flashed, and ere Harold could recover from the surprise of his appearance, the boat in which he came, lay, a dark spot, in the red, rippling glitter of the waves. The third gun rang out, and the ship was under sail. The red shawl waved again. Harold stood, bewildered, and insensible, but watching it, as if his spirit would take its flight, the moment that it ceased to move. A throng of white scarfs succeeded, streaming from every window of the house. His heart swelled—his blood flowed again. He could have knelt and wept, in speechless, mournful gratitude. It was so comforting—`Loena!' O, God! he dared not think of her yet. He watched the battlements, till his eyes ached, and his heart ran over, all night long. O, what a night it was—so endless—so cold and wearying. The day light broke, and they were still in sight of the castle; and yet, Harold did not desire to go on shore again. How strangely are we compounded! We would not, even where we most love, reiterate the tenderness of a farewell: mournful, and sweet, and thrilling as it is, there is somewhat revolting and fearful, in the idea of returning but to repeat it. Farewell! farewell! Another hour, and the loud breeze rang in the cordage. Harold sat by the prow, observing the appearance of the deep green water, not yet sufficiently recovered from the late terrible shock, to know where he was, or what he had lost. But this calm was not to be forever. He gazed upon the water, from its first faint eddying, and rippling about the prow, till it foamed up, higher and higher, as the proud ship, impelled by the constantly pressing wind, plunged along upon her way; and finally ran, and roared like a mill race, all white and shining, with commotion in the wake of their ship. Another half hour, and the topsails creaked, the masts bent, and the yards dipped—and forward! forward! she thundered through the water, and the green waves washed over her, and lightened in her chariot race. O, darkness! `a portion of the tempest, and of thee!' Throw me upon the ocean! By heaven! I would rather run under, under! with every sail set, and every colour flying, to the very bottom of the ocean, in such a wind, than to float along the wide, beautiful water, like a tame, lifeless animal. No! upon the sea, give me foam, and wind, and uproar!—quiet upon the land. If I must ride the billows, let it be in a ship, that strains fore and aft, like a blood horse in the race! Harold kept his place, and ate not, drank not, slept not, until they came to the ocean. This seemed to disturb him. Many a sorrowing face had approached, and wished him happier, without daring to speak to him— many! but all had at last retired, shutting up their compassion in their own bosoms, and leaving him to the iron solitude of his own heart. He raised his face, and leant upon his hands—His forehead and locks dripping with the cold spray, and all his garments drenched with it. He shivered—and was still again, as death. The black horizon was all before him—the black ocean all around him—that deep, distinct, and oppressive image of infinity—his temples ached, and he gasped for breath, as he looked upon it. The moon, in its fullness and beauty, shone directly down upon a spot, so preternaturally bright, that Harold put out his hands, mechanically, as he felt the vessel approach it, whether in terrour or not, it was difficult to say. They passed through it, and Harold shut his eyes for a moment, as if he expected the vessel to leap down. He opened his eyes, and beheld the shadow of the ship, black as death, with all her banners and sails, and lattice work, reaching downward, almost to infinity! and when the last gun was fired, as they broke out, all at once, into the tumultuous ocean, it was difficult for poor Harold to persuade himself, that the amazingly near, and distinct, shattering reverberation, that he heard, was not a second gun, fired from the spectre ship that seemed under his. He saw the white smoke roll out below—the fire, stream—and then followed the crashing thunder, more loudly than from the gun fired at his side. He started at the sound, and shuddered—and covered his face with his hands. A female was near him. He shrunk back with the instinctive delicacy of a lover, VOL. I. B b profaning for the first time, and inadvertently, his allegiance to his dear one. The stranger was much disturbed; and leaned, for a moment, against the railing. It was carelessly left, and swung out. She would have fallen, had not Harold heard a faint cry, and caught her, just as her drapery passed him. `Her heart beats terribly,' thought Harold; `poor creature!' and once he stood, petrified before her, as he observed the sweeping outline of her form—She breathed aloud—her head fell upon his shoulder. Gracious heaven! he has shaken her off, and leaped upon the unsteady railing—will he? dare he brave the living God, so desperately? What power upholds him there? Will he, the madman, will he plunge into the roaring abyss? O! there is something so horrible in the levity of a maniac—something so awful, so appalling in the sublime movement of a desperate man, in his frightful insensibility to danger. And there stood Harold—there!—unstayed by a rope or a finger—upright, with his arms outstretched—and the vessel reeling and plunging under him. The lady arose to depart; but beholding him in his perilous situation, became confirmed in the general belief of the passengers, that he was crazed; she had the presence of mind to speak to him in a tone of authority, and command him to come down. He obeyed—meekly, as a dying man. Her movement was haughty, dignified, but compassionate; and Harold was quieted. No matter who he had first thought she was, when he shrieked and leaped upon his perilous foot hold; it was evident that he now found her to be some other being. She waved her hand, and another female, who had been leaning in the shadow of the foresail, silently and motionless, so entirely motionless, indeed, as not to have been heard or seen, till then, by even the timid and watchful Harold—she tendered her arm; the first lady took it, as an accustomed thing, for which no gratitude, no thanks were to be given, and no surprise expressed. Could she be a servant? She walked beautifully. She could not tread thus, in servitude. The undulation of her satin drapery, in the moonlight, showed off her rounded proportions, distinctly, in a line of waving splendour; and when she set her firm foot upon the deck, a sudden shivering of the dress, like silver foil, or metallick cobweb—bespoke either uncommon energy, or uncommon agitation of heart. Which was it? Harold followed her with his eyes, and at last, although he knew it not, with his steps, for a few paces. Not a word was spoken—and he followed on, he knew not why, nor wherefore. There was a rich feeling of communion, loneliness, and sorrow at his heart, that drew him to her, and still he followed her. She heard his step—and turned, and rebuked him. He faltered— bowed—and could have thrown himself flat upon his face, and put her foot upon his neck, with his own hands, he felt so humbled. How came he there? Had he listened? No! but her rebuke, so calm, so unimpassioned, so awful in its serenity, the rebuke he felt, of a hallowed creature, whose broken-heartedness had been intruded upon; O! it was death to him. He wanted to weep—to fall upon her bosom, upon any body's bosom, and sob, and tell her, over and over again, that it was not curiosity, no! but enchantment, that had so wrought upon him. But he could not open his lips. He fell back, abashed and confounded. He had heard voices: but it was as if he had heard them in his sleep, talking unintelligible musick to comfort him. He had seen these women pass away, and he had followed them, as he would a retiring vision; as wild birds will follow wild harmony; their little hearts giddy with the hope of hearing it once more—once more, ere it die away, forever, in the air of heaven. O, it was an irresistible witchery that touched so sweetly, and so gently on the strings of his heart. Poor Harold, even in the hours of his entirest self-possession, could not have disobeyed it. But now, it was a spell to him, and to break it off, was to break his heart. He could not open his lips; and the statelier step of the elder female, the look of offended dignity, gradually subsided; while the younger, (for she must have been younger, and more innocent, and more beautiful, than the other) stood beseechingly by, and both appeared convinced, from the manly embarrassment, the imploring, disconsolate eyes of Harold, that if he had sinned against courtesy, and heaven—for heaven is courtesy— he had sinned unwittingly. They descended to their state room alone. Why did not Harold offer his arm? He knew not. He dared not. He was fettered, rooted to the spot. Was it with shame, contrition, or what? Where was Loena? Where his other love, the abused and rifled? Away, away—and no monitory voice near to sound the alarum in his heart—to tell him, that he was playing treason with his fealty—sleeping, where the bandages of his allegiance were parting, like untwisted flax in the flame. Here was another sleepless night, to wear upon his broken and wearied spirit. Why is it, that, to them who have most need of sleep, sleep cometh not? There is no forgetfulness, no suspension of sorrow—but the happy, they are so sweetly and benignly refreshed, that the longest night is, to them, but one blessed moment of interruption: fitting them anew for enjoyment—But to the weary in heart, there is no refreshment, even in forgetfulness. The troubled element on which they would repose, is never entirely still—they are incessantly agitated and terrified. Alas, for Harold! A continual and confused ringing was about him, all night long. Worn, and trembling, and sick at heart, time appeared to stand still, as he turned, again and again, and adjusted his limbs to the rugged cordage, upon which he lay, until he was utterly exhausted. If he slumbered for a moment, he would feel himself sinking, and would leap, like a drowning man from the water, with a loud, inarticulate cry, as if his very blood vessels were bursting with horrour; yet hardly would he shut his aching eyes again, than he would feel that, upon which he lay, gradually yielding, like the loose fragments of a crumbling precipice; and that by which he held, instinctively, even in his sleep, lest in the lurching and heaving of the ship, he might be lost, before he could recommend his soul to God; even that gradually detaching itself, like a ruptured branch, until he would shriek, like a falling man, and start broad awake, with foam upon his lips, and the sweat standing upon his bosom and forehead—the sweat of his own heart. His conscience was wofully beset too; he thought the morning had past, and that the last sun had arisen in darkness—that the heavens above, where all was of a preternatural blackness, had passed away, forever. All about him was of such an inconceivable, appalling infinitude. `O, that I could be near thee, once more, my beloved, even in thy narrow home—how calmly would I await the trumpet. With thy hand in mine, sweet; thy innocent face turned toward mine, O, I could see nought of terrour, or flame: nought but heaven and love. I would that I were with thee, wherever thou art, love!' His thought was still bewildered. He was not, even yet, awake to the whole dreadful reality of his loss; and he continued, `O, why did I ever leave thee, love? leave thee too, without one of the innumerable blessings with which my soul overflowed!—without expressing a thousandth part of the endearment that I ought. And thou, too—I have already forgotten thy last kiss. Where was it? When was it? Surely there is something deadly cold hanging upon my heart—I cannot even recollect where we parted. Art thou, O Loena, art thou forgotten so soon?—or—O, horrour! is my poor brain darkened by some portentous calamity? God, have mercy on me!' As these thoughts passed, like flashing fire, through and through him, he could have thrown himself overboard, as he lay, and swum back to her, merely to announce, what in her presence he had forgotten—a few, a very few, of the ten thousand things of tenderness and weeping affection—to repeat, forever, and ever, his protestations and caresses. And then his conscience would awake, and put on her bloody robes, and sit over him with a terrible countenance—and he would feel himself pinioned, naked, hand and foot—helpless, alone—with just enough of light to see the far off and dim movement of innumerable feet, incessantly approaching in the darkness, as of some cumbrous, and interminable monster—and to feel ten thousand detestable B b 2 and obscene creatures crawling slowly over his very lips and eyes, which he had no power to shut—slimy, loathsome reptiles, slipping lazily over his naked fingers; while his very flesh crawled and quivered, and rotted, in the poison that they left in their trail. Anon, this would be changed. The light would break out upon him—he would be sleeping in a delicious green solitude—the earth flowering all about him, with fountains flowing `in odour and gold'—and violets—`but the trail of the serpent was over them all.' He would lie, so happy, so purely, so perfectly happy—he would feel an approaching face—his hair would be stirred by a gentle breathing—he would awake, and behold two miniature pictures of himself—a pair of the loveliest blue eyes over him, dissolving in lustre—with an image of himself in each—damp, luminous—transparent—like the swimming azure of heaven—or violets exhaling colour, and substance, and perfume, all in the red sunshine! Something cold would touch him. He would start; and lo! Elvira would pass before his eyes, with swollen lips, and blood-shot eyes, pronouncing his name aloud, with a hollow voice, like one on her death bed—`Harold, Harold the destroyer! I summon thee before the judgment seat! I am there! and lo! I await thy coming!' Again the scene would shift, in the convulsion of his heart—A sky of clouded gold would be over him, lacquered with every brilliant hue—inlaid with all the colouring of a Turkish cymeter—bloody pearl, and blue, with rippling silver and crimson—all the boundless landscape so still, in such sublime repose! Spirits would go walking by him, arm and arm, in the heavens; and now and then, one would pause, and lay his hand upon his fellows' heart, which instantly broke out, like a loud organ, with all manner of echoing harmonies. Then, a strange obscurity would arise, like the vapour of charnel houses, offensive and sickening—and some other violent transition would succeed, alternately— from heaven to hell, from hell to heaven, would he vibrate, like a pendulum. `It was, as if the dead could feel The icy worm around them steal; And shudder, as the reptiles creep, And revel in their rotting sleep; Without the power to scare away The cold consumers of their clay;' And then, as if the very dead were suddenly thrilling with life, and borne away—to the tranquillest climes: Where—`light breezes but ruffle the flowers sometimes.' Anon, the magnificent phenomena of heaven would be rolling over him—his own forest trees would glimmer in the star light; the river, where he had so often bathed, would sparkle at his feet, and the long grass would dip and float away, and ripple beautifully before him—and Loena, his own Loena, would trip softly behind him—he would hear her coming, with her little naked feet, and determine to enjoy her surprise. She would lay her hand upon his shoulder— he would turn; his eyes running over with heaven and love, to press her beautiful mouth—he would turn— and the blue face of a dead woman, with eyeless sockets, and bare teeth, would touch his lips. `God! God!' and yet he could not wake—no, nor sleep. It was one everlasting delirium—a creature, he felt he was, even then, impregnate with divinity and fire, but helpless and motionless, rotting away in solitude. He would shriek—he would awake—all was dark about him; nevertheless, to his senses, he was still asleep. He heard the roaring of the water—he felt the salt spray washing over him, but he feared to move, lest he should be drowned, and knew not whether he were going forward or backward—nor indeed, whether he was living or dead. All about him was intensely doubtful and unreal. He put out his hands, and stretched his fingers. The coiled cordage was there—to his diseased touch, it was a folded serpent, of immeasurable longitude, covered with eyes and hair. He thrust them upward; they encountered gaping wounds—the very air was sticky and glutinous to his lungs, as with blood—its loathsome smell too, was all about him—the darkness was crowded with livid faces—shuddering with swollen lips—eyes bursting from their sockets, and dropping with coagulated blood. He shut his eyelids, and covered his face with both hands, and held his breath. `It is dark,' he muttered. `It is perfectly dark—I can see nothing—hear nothing—and yet I am sure that there is something near me—something walking continually around me. Ask me not how this is—how it can be. It is—that is enough for me. I feel it. I know it. Gracious God —there!—do I not feel the blood spurting in my face—there!—there!—drop after drop is trickling from my forehead to my lips—oh—and I cannot stir hand nor foot—I cannot even turn my head'—It was the salt water only, dashed over him, by a sudden dip of the vessel; and the drops came from the saturated sail above, deadly cold, but to his fervid temples, they appeared hot and scalding—`again! there! there!—the very hair upon my forehead stirred by gasping breath—Ho, there!—a dying man is upon me—I am strangled— drowning—pinioned—ho, there! help! for mercy's sake! help!' His cries were so terrible, that the whole ship's company were alarmed. They surrounded the trembling creature with lights, on which he started, as if they were the self illuminated torches of the sepulcre. They attempted to soothe him. He was sullen, and recovered for a moment, sufficiently to rebuke them. They left him, all but one human creature, who determined to lie by him, and protect him, in his paroxysms, even from himself; nay, he was half inclined to lash him to the vessel, as he lay, secretly, lest some sudden movement might be fatal, before he could interfere. But he dared not. He was full of mortal apprehension, when he looked upon the awful countenance of young Harold. He soon became more composed; and was evidently beginning to recollect some of the incidents attending his departure. `O, what an unappeasable longing!—I have left thee, dear, left thee, with no human being to protect thee—forgive me, love! I am frail. Be thou not so frail—accursed wretch! would he have harmed thine innocence? Where is he now? With thee—with thee, perhaps—now, who shall protect thee? Ten thousand curses on my folly! Why did I ever leave thee? dear, dear, Loena! Wilt thou love me yet? Wilt thou? May he not—hell and furies! no, I will not think of it. O, be true to me, love, and I will be true to thee, forever; to blood and death!' Here came back his love again, with jealousy, too, like a torrent, to his heart, rushing and thundering through all its channels, like a pent up ocean, suddenly discharged over a broken boundary; all his arteries were sore, and trembling with the conflict, and his temples were smitten with sudden pain, as his bereaved and benighted intellect started from her sleep, and kindled her lamp, anew, and sought out her offspring. He arose, moved his benumbed and weltering limbs. It was already the hour of daylight, and yet the darkness weighed upon him like something heavy. The pitching of the vessel began to affect him, and the anxiety of his mind, as Memory went groping through his treasures, disturbing the relicks, and hallowed things, with a vulgar, rummaging, unsparing, hand, became insupportable. He shrank, as from a ruffian visitor, who invades your sanctuary, and rifles it, in his rude attempt at consolation; letting in the hateful daylight, upon the sores and fissures of your naked, wounded, ulcerated, and broken heart. What dear thing might she not touch, in her unhallowed carelessness! Whose ashes? Whose hair? His heart failed him. The past was all a grave yard to him, and to explore it, was to profane it. `Accursed be the foot of the intruder upon it! accursed the light, other than a funeral vapour, which shines upon it,' said Harold. `Be my retirement undisturbed—unvisited—I hate the impertinent meddling of the compassionate: them, that gossip with the afflicted.' Of storms upon the water, Harold had heard; that they were very terrible, he believed. But he panted to hear the approach of their wings and trumpets. Lord! how his spirit rose, and lashed itself, at the sound of their coming. But they passed. He felt his heart drooping; and a sickening, questionless despondency lying, like a dead weight, upon his vitals—like the pressure of a decayed hand, damp and cold. His bead ached to bursting. Streams of fire shot through his eye-balls. The hot sweat ran down his cheeks like rain—and then, he was so faint! so sick at heart! sick and faint, with a death like, tremulous sensation, attended with scorching heat, and cold shivering, in succession. `What had he done, to deserve this, all this,' he asked. He went to the cabin, for the first time, and crept into a spare birth, there to die, as quietly as he might. He had no other wish or thought. `What have I done?' he repeated to himself, as he laid his wet forehead and hair upon the mattrass. `What done. O, I have deserted the kindest, truest one! and where am I to find another? not upon earth. Then why should I live?' He started: a ripple ran along by his elbow in the birth—he felt the articulated movement of some sea reptile: perhaps a shark cleaving the water; and a sort of quick splashing, as if the creature had just gone entirely by. His blood ran cold. Who could tell, what bloated monster, gorged already with the festering garbage of the great deep—what filthy and horrible shape, fattened on some floating and swollen human body, which it had preyed upon, in its hideous restlessness—amid the unceasing agitation of wind, and waves, and brine, and muscles! who could tell what abominable, slimy creature of this dark element was now busied by the side of poor Harold, drawn by the scent of her prey—separated from it only by one plank!—floundering and circling at his side, at his very elbow! gracious heaven! the measureless, bottomless solitudes of the ocean upturned—and all their tenantry rolling about him, and under him, and above him, and over him—all unwieldly and ravenous monsters, from the four corners of the sea, revelling in their dominion, about the mighty ship, as she thundered upon her pathway, and exulting in the certainty and nearness of their appointed meal. Another thrill— could he be dreaming again? He sat instantly upright; but his right arm and shoulder to the finger-ends, were numb and lifeless—a dreadful sensation, heavy, leaden, and lumpish, wanting the dignity of pain, and the activity of torment, followed. That, or either he would have borne. His Indian nature would have scorned all burning, fiery agonies. He could bear to be torn with red hot pincers, but the bravest will strike, and so would Harold, with a gesture of impatience, the moscheto that stung. So, too, the soldier that faces a shower of bullets, will turn his back upon the small dust, that is raised in a high wind—because, if he face the latter, he would meet, instead of applause, with derision. And is this all that makes us bear pain without flinching? It is. Never was Harold's proud spirit so quelled. He was sick, and labouring under the reproof of his own heart. A beleaguring darkness was about him, accompanied with a fearful derangement of his faculties, confounding the past, present, and future. He had fallen. `Would she prove firmer than he had been?' he asked himself. Was she more accessible? less tender? more cautious? had she more self-command? less curiosity? and did she love more than he, when he fell? The answer was a ten fold agony; the riotingof his undisciplined spirit. Was there no relief? Yes, in occupation. But how to occupy himself? He could not endure the mysterious trifling of cards and chess—that was too unsocial, selfish, agitating. Such, at least, was his opinion. He had seen lovers quarrel over the board—fathers and children war with each other—and wives neglected, sitting alone—company forgotten—all the civilities of life overlooked; while the chess board, with a damnable infatuation, was, like a battle field, literally pictured upon the hearts of them that combatted thereon. But Harold knew not then, what he afterwards learnt, that all games are selfish delusions: that all games may elicit evil passion, and that chess of all others, should be the game of the statesman and the soldier—teaching fortitude, patience, firmness, perseverance, foresight, reflection, strengthening the memory, and exercising the judgment beyond all other studies. This was his game, nevertheless. The deep pressure of the eye—the alternate flashes of crimson and paleness, over the forehead, and the immovable engagedness of the combatants, were a proof to him that there was something warlike and entrancing in it. He was right. It is a game of perpetual generalship and stratagem. A blockhead never played a good game of chess, no, nor an impatient, a short-sighted, or capricious man. Days had passed, and nights had followed, and Harold was still the same. He seemed to have entirely forgotten the situation in which he left Loena: and the two female strangers avoided him with obvious care, as an unhappy wretch, crazed perhaps, by remorse—who could not be bettered by their prayers or tears. At times, they were inclined to remonstrate with the captain for not confining him, and even for having taken him on board; but when they looked in his face, their eyes filled, and they could not speak unkindly of him, even in his absence. At last, he began to sleep soundly. He was able to recal, upon his knees, all that had happened. `And is she dead? poor girl!' he would say. `No, no, I will not believe it. Desperate as is the hope, I will cling to it. I will never believe that she is dead, until I meet her, face to face, at the judgment seat—no, never!' He was awakened from a delightful dream, by a loud trampling upon deck—the bell rang—the drum beat— the enginery suddenly moved, with its chains and windlass, as if under the convulsive effort of all the ship's company—Almighty God! that shock!—Harold was thrown out of his birth—the water rushed over him, and the knell, as of a drowning multitude, from the very bottom of the ocean, mounted and pealed, and rang, and thundered up the sky. Shrieks followed! `She is going! she is going!' he heard many voices cry —the ship keeled—stopped—wavered for a moment— shuddered like a living creature upon the verge of a precipice—and lo! the waves rolled over her, and came, like breakers, down the companion way. Not a sound nor a step, was heard upon deck. Was she going down? whence this mortal stillness? Harold leaped upon deck. Not a soul was to be seen. The sails were flying loose upon the wind, and tearing loudly at every flap—the waves rushing over her, like a cataract, and her head all under water: the guns were broken from their moorings, and the steering wheel was, though of solid iron, shivered into ten thousand pieces. What was to be done? A man leaped upon deck, half-naked, and gasping for breath. He had a trumpet; he blew it, as if he would awake the dead. The deck was covered in an instant—lights were kindled—the rudder lashed down. The ship rounded to, and righted, with the loss of all her top masts, and her bowsprit sprung. But what, what in the name of horrour, had happened? was the cry. None knew—none could conjecture. It was very dark—the wind blew, and the sky thundered—`Was she on fire? had she struck a rock— an ice island?'—At this moment, the lightning blazed down upon the water, and showed a circular wake of white foam, behind, as far as the eye could reach. The captain looked at the compass; they were driven entirely out of their course—but the watch, the pilot, where were they? The truth broke upon them, all at once. She had run foul of something, when tilting at her fullest speed, and shipped a sea that swept her decks. And Harold now recollected, that, as he came up, he saw afar off, by a blaze of lightning, that almost blinded him, something black and shattered, suddenly disappear, in the broad and foaming wake of the ship. Yes, it was too true! they had run down a smaller vessel, at midnight, and sent her under, with every living soul, as they were sleeping, perhaps!—and the cry—that appalling cry, as of a suffocating army—that was from the few who saw the danger, and wrenched the windlas in vain, to avoid it; poor fellows! they were going down, and would be forever and ever, going down, to the bottomless ocean!' And the survivors were but a little behind them— their ship was filling fast, and the mainmast soon went by the board. By the blessing of heaven, however, their minute guns were heard, and answered. A great black shadow emerged from the horizon, and bore down upon them, in the storm. Their fifth gun was hardly fired, when, amid the thunder of heaven, the roaring winds, and the boiling, whirling, agitated ocean, up came a great ship, crowded with sails, and covered with people, foaming and plunging along the VOL. I. C C path, like some mighty monarch, to the relief of the disconsolate. Another hour, and the deck of a British 84 was covered with half-naked, shrieking, shivering wretches, among whom were many females, and some, with babes in their bosoms. They prayed to stay by the sinking ship, so long as there was any thing to be seen of her; and that they might the more easily do this, at the last visit of the long boat, the officer hung a lantern at each of her yards that was standing. Harold had been completely roused by this adventure. His first thought was of the two women who had so marvellously interested him at first. Their images were still upon his mind, burning and distinct: but then, so were many images of his dreaming; might not these women be apparitions of a troubled sleep? He was not half satisfied with the thought. But in peril, he was the first to find them. He broke open their door without ceremony, and literally plucked them out by the locks. They were distracted, locked in each other's arms, and dying with affright. Now they forgot his phrenzy. They permitted him to stand by them, and comfort them, not with words, for he spake not, but with looks: looks that were so resolute, so collected, that the poor, helpless creatures clung to him, in consummate confidence, young as he was, and terrible as he had been. Such is the prerogative of true greatness. It is unseen, except in times of trial and intimidation. Then it comes up, bares its right arm, and stands out, the champion of the whole human family, against all that dare to assail them —the inundation, and the tempest. He had saved two human creatures—he, whose trode had been destruction, hitherto. How different were his feelings now. Scarcely had he clasped the offered hand of the younger lady, which he did, with a feeling of devoutness that never before visited his heart, of thankfulness, that set his wet locks shivering upon his pale forehead, than he lifted his eyes to the fiery and rolling heavens, and fainted. He slept—his insensibility was delicious. He dreamed of his beloved—was forgiven, restored, and blessed, with lips, and hands, and eyes. But oh, when life came back—then was the trial! His lungs, sore and shrinking as they were, seemed suddenly inflated with a whirlwind of fire! lava ran through his veins, and scorched his nerves; and a horrible numbness was experienced about the region of the heart, resembling, in nature, though ten thousand times more aggravated, the sickly, fretful, unwilling return of life, to a benumbed limb— when you dread to lift it, and the very muscles ache at the simple thought of moving it. Yea, they forced him back to life again; and many deaths had been preferable to one such resuscitation.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XVII. `Il n'est pas si diable qu'il est noir! Ei non è cose cattive como mostra all apparenza. `La vista de los que tiernamente se han amado, dexa de ser un bien, luego que se pierde la esperanza de poseerse—' I am weary of this childish pedantry. I have done with quotations. My obedience, to the foolish and preposterous fashion of the day, has now been carried far enough. If I cannot be permitted to write for myself, and in English, I wont write at all. My own story shall be told in my own way. I shall continue my narrative, henceforth, so long as I find it interesting to myself—in my own language, and no longer. The devil may take them that delight in gabble and patchwork—the fag ends of all languages, and all men. I'll have nothing more to do with either. It was sunshine again. Harold was still alone. Every eye was upon him, and at every pause in the conversation, some low whispers, even from the children, would show how deeply all were interested in his happiness, or, at least, in his appearance. His immoveable attitude, his unaffected abstraction, the sublimity of his desolate aspect, were all matters of exceeding curiosity and admiration, for a time. The children, sweet innocents! clung to him, and, after a few circling gambols, in every one of which, they came nearer and nearer, till they provoked him to put out his hand, mechanically, to arrest one of their number, all, as by one consent, began a riotous assault upon him. His countenance brightened, for a moment, in spite of himself, as he participated in their rude merriment. Why was his face, so repulsive to man, and attractive to these babes? How vivid and distinct must be the touches of humanity in such a face, to be visible, so instantly, to children! How soon, too, the little creature, the nursling at the breast, nay, the very brute, how soon it will discover, and hide itself, from the portentous lowering of an evil eye. The thought that curls the lip, the most secret, lurking malignity of man's face, are detected by the sunny blue eye of childhood, almost as readily as by the dark, penetrating orb of experience. To the good man, or rather, the good-hearted man, however unhappy, haughty, and repulsive, the child and the brute will hie for protection. From the bad man, with all his allurement and fascination, they will fly, with a mortal antipathy. Is not this most wise? Ought evil to be mistaken? And when the dark passions of our nature utter their own testimony against us, and emblazon their evidence upon our very fronts; who, that reflects, will lightly tamper with them? who would not, rather, the moment that he feels the stirrings of their rebellion, arise in his strength, and bind them hand and foot. The children were soon called away, and separated, but Harold was again roused from his revery—during the latter part of which, there was a growing fierceness in his eyes—a more difficult breathing, and heaving of the chest—by the touch of an infant's hand. He looked down, and beheld the sweetest little fellow in the world, slyly thrusting a part of his cake into his hand, as it hung lifelessly over a gun carriage. The company had all paired off. Those who were acquainted, and those who were not; the passengers of the last vessel, and the men of this, were all to be distinguished by the thousand indescricable somethings which mark the intercourse of people, even when lolling together. Refined spirits cannot be familiar at once, even where their lives have been saved together. Harold laid his cheek upon the head of the child. The little creature looked up in his face, clapped his hands aloud, and called out, `O, my pa! my pa!'—Harold coloured to the eyes. He dared not look up, fearful of encountering the distressed countenance of some youthful mother. Harold was unaccountably affected by the manner of the child. Perhaps he was deceived, but the voice, so thrilling passionate, and sweet, sounded half familiar to him. Willing to conceal his embarrassment, which increased to a fever, as the boy persisted in caressing him, and even crying to get up in his lap, Harold began questioning him. `Well, my little hero: so your name is—what?' `What, pa?' `Dont call me pa, dear; I am not your pa—' `O, yes, you be—you be!' reiterated the child, putting its little hand over his mouth. `Well, well. What is your name.' `Leopold,' was the reply. He could hardly pronounce it, and it was not till he had several times repeated it, that Harold could comprehend the sound. `Well, Leopold—how old are you. I suppose you know?' `What, pa?' Harold smiled in spite of himself, at the pertinacity of the child, but repeated his question. `How old are you my dear?' `Three years old, next—no—two years old, the fifth day of last June.' `No more!' cried Harold in astonishment, kissing him again and again. Harold had no experience in such matters, and would have set this boy down as five, at least; such was the spirited intelligence of his countenance—the celestial animation of his clear hazel eye, as he prattled away clapping his hands, and kicking up his heels. Indeed, the creature seemed actually transparent—his C C 2 skin was so clear, his rosy blood so hasty and rash, that at every pulsation, his face glowed all over, and his eyes sparkled afresh. The boy fell asleep in Harold's bosom, and there slept, until a female servant, who, Harold now recollected, had been near him during the whole of his prattle, approached to take him away. But the child awoke, and clung to him, and was permitted to stay. The evening air blew sweetly over them, and all the company were walking about, with a drowsy, contented, indolent expression of tranquillity and listlessness. Some lay about the deck, by the indulgence of the captain, with a beautiful negligence of all ceremony, and in such unapprehensive security, as it was delightful to reflect upon, after one had so narrowly escaped foundering. The deep stillness, that stole over them—as the night deepened, and the great sails swelled in the wind, of which there was just enough to keep them steadily filled was like religion. There was a solemnity and tenderness too, in every living creature aboard, as if they were attending some incantation, from the priesthood of nature—the spirits of the ocean, sceptred and mitred. This would be broken by some sleepy observation, uttered, in mere weariness, by some one of the company, more as if he were thinking aloud, than with the desire of provoking conversation. But the spell would be broken. The holiness of the time would be forgotten. Another would speak —another! until the whole deck was resounding again. But this would not continue long —one voice would drop away after another. A longer interval would occur between questions and replies, showing no unusual symptom in the listener, until all would be hush again as the house of death—an uninterrupted stillness, that it was fearful, nay, almost irreligious to break in upon, with aught but musick or prayer. Harold felt a delicious melancholy, like the newly comforted, amid this scenery. His cheek rested against the warm cheek of the sweet boy, whose breath, like a continual whisper, went by his ear, while his little fat hands were thrust, cake and all, into Harold's bosom. The fancy of Harold led him back, dancing and singing, to the times of his boyhood, when he was as happy, and as innocent, (for the innocent are always happy) as this child. He shut his eyes. He heard his native winds blowing among the green leaves—he saw the blossoms flutter and fall like butterflies—he saw the sparkling of wild birds among the high tree tops, and heard their liquid piping all about him—one would begin in the silence—another, another, till the whole air would ring again—then, one would fall off—another, and another, till a dead, breathless silence followed— and there was the blue water too, the same—rippling at his feet. Harold was startled by a strange voice near him; strange, not so much, for being the voice of a stranger, as for being so calm, steady, and authoritative. It was a deliberate, articulate musick, and evidently came from one, whose opinion was not to be disputed, or had not often been. And yet there was no arrogance, no assumption in it. It was rather the calm thinking aloud, of habitual greatness, and self-possession. The voice was retiring; and the person, whoever he was, descended to his apartment; for his voice was heard no more, that night. `What think you of him?' was timidly articulated by some female, yet nearer him, as if retorting a question. He turned. Was it addressed to him?—no—for a quick, snappish voice replied—`think of him!—I!— why, that he is a quack, and a fool.' `A fool!—O, no, that is impossible! what amazing colloquial power he has. Did you ever hear the like before?' `Never, Julia! and hope never to, again.' `Indeed!' `Yes—indeed!—cousin. But what think you of him?' `What do I think of him?' `Julia! look at me. You are not accustomed to echoing my words, in this way—are you bewitched? Come tell me; what is your opinion of him?' `Upon my word, I have not dared to form one yet.' `Not dared! you are strangely scrupulous just now —I have wondered at your forbearance. You have not spoken a loud word since you saw him—his name has been constantly upon your lips—your eyes have been rivetted upon his face, and yet, for the first time in your life, you have not dared to think for yourself. Come—now for it.' `Nay, then, cousin—I will not. I do not think that either you or I, are capable of estimating that man aright.' `Well done, Julia! Is he not haughty beyond all endurance; absolute and dictatorial in his manner?—and what a wicked, devilish temper he must have. Nay, Julia, this looks suspicious. Don't leave me, till you have answered me in some way—yes, or no.' `Well then—no! no! no! He is not haughty. Do you not see how affable, how kind he is to the servants, and the children. He is only haughty, as a great man should be, when obtrusive impertinence is to be rebuked.' `Thank ye, dear.' `No, no, cousin—you know me too well to suspect that I have any allusion to you, now. If I am disposed to affront another, you know too, that it is not my way to deal in hints, or inuendoes. I leave nothing to conjecture—nothing to explanation. But this man—he is dictatorial to us, and why? because I am sure that he is right, when he opens his lips, and that we are wrong— no matter what the subject is, he is at home, every where, and though his opinions seem hasty and spontaneous, yet I find, on listening to him, that they have been well considered, and prepared for use before, and laid by for occasion—and then, his temper—' `Do you remember the dinner table?' `Do I?—yes—with a proud heart. He, a bad temper! look at his forehead, when he is undisturbed—is it not full of natural benignity? I ask ye, cousin? Did you ever see a countenance fuller of serenity, beautiful serenity? sublimated, I admit, and ready to be changed in a moment, like the blue sky above, when the thunder assails it. `Really, cousin; you are getting quite poetical.' `Really, cousin, I scorn to be other than poetical, if enthusiasm and warmth be poetry, when such a creature is traduced.' `But what think you of his antagonist?' `His antagonist! pshaw! The coxcomb—he, whose head is a toyshop, and heart, impurity—whose discourse is a perpetual digression.' `But the style of his conversation—is it not delightful—entertaining, beyond expression?' `His conversation! I never heard him converse, I protest. I have heard him talk—and talk—and then, he is so awkward—so sentimental—so lack-a-daisical, too.' `And then, there is the colonel—surely you cannot object to his colloquial powers; or his address.' `His address!—ha! ha! ha!—do you remember his address in getting himself out of the scrape at the table? Yes, I thought that was very well—' says he, `sir, this, and sir, that—and by God, this, sir—and by God, that, swearing till my blood ran cold—and then, says my hero, in his calm way, laying down his knife and fork; (O, I could have hugged him, and kissed him for it, on the spot!) and looking the terrible colonel, directly in the eyes—`Sir, there are ladies present—' and then, oh! the gallant colonel! `the fiery duke! the hot duke!' he had the audacity, you know, just to strike the table with his fist, and swear another tremendous volley—and then— O, but stay, cousin, don't go—you know I stayed for you, just now, when you were at my favourite, tooth and nail. And now, tell me; do you know the result?' `No, I do not.' `Well, don't be snappish, and I'll tell you. You all scampered off, you know, as if you saw blood upon the table. But I stayed. There was a dead silence after the ladies had gone—and O, never shall I forget the terrible calmness of my hero—`sir,' said he, after looking yours in the face, for more than a minute— I tell you what it is, colonel, this bullying won't do for me. Your manner convinces me that you are a fool, and I have no doubt that you are a coward. Nay, don't interrupt me, for by the living God! if you open your lips before I have finished, I'll throw you out of the cabin window. I have endured a great deal of your presumption and impertinence. It is time that they were curbed. Now, mark me—if I see any more of these airs, while I am on board this vessel, I will make an example of you.' Saying this, he turned to leave the room; but the colonel made a desperate effort to reply.' `Well, sir; and suppose I do, sir—what will you do, sir?' `My hero looked at him, with such pity, for a moment, and then, deliberately added, in a tone, that thrilled my blood—`I!—I will chastise you upon the spot—horsewhip you!' Harold was delighted with this girl; and was a long time puzzling himself to determine what had caused her vivacity and emphasis, as she had gone on; but without success, until he caught her eye glancing at him; innocently, to be sure. Harold looked round. He was the only man near enough to hear what she said; and although she affected to be so carried away by her own feelings, as to be insensible of his proximity, still, Harold had experience enough of the human heart to perceive that her vivacity was not natural, and would not have been so extreme, had she really been alone with her cousin. The fact was, that the lively creature was showing off, in the festivity of her spirit, merely because she knew that a handsome stranger was near enough to hear her, without rudeness. Harold turned, and listened. The speaker was small, and exquisitely fashioned—a pale girl, with waving, heavy tresses, and eyes sparkling with vivacity—but they instantly changed, and languished through their tresses. The voice of authority was heard again. `Hush! hush!' she exclaimed! `I hear his tread.' The stranger entered. He was about the middle size, but he had an eagle eye; and his voice was as strong, clear, and deep-running, as before, into cadence, without affectation or effort. He continued speaking to some one that walked at his side, along the deck; and his tone was so full and natural, his language so simple and energetick—so awfully distinct at times, that, had you not seen him pass before you, a small, thin man, you would have looked, on hearing his voice, for the movement and carriage of something above humanity. `Young man!' such was the purport of his conversation, as it was caught at intervals, in his going and returning before Harold, with such an air of unlaboured majesty.—`this disposition must be subdued. You are making yourself, and every body else unhappy. It is time that you should be made to feel. You have a generous spirit—a brave one—and I mean to give you a lesson, that will make you a wiser and better man; still it is possible, for such is the way of the world, that you may prefer taking my heart's blood, to following my advice. Be it so. I shall put them both before you. You shall take your choice. The other passengers I see, are afraid of you. So they were of the colonel— nay, be patient.' `Sir!' cried the other, as if thunderstruck—`by what authority, sir, do you dare—' `By the authority of wisdom and experience,' continued his tormentor, in the same tone—`dare!—young man! it is long since I have dared any thing.' `Sir!' `And sir, I will not be interrupted—silence!—hear me!' `You are in a perpetual wrangle. Your aliment is paradox and contradiction. We have yielded too often to you. It has made you presumptuous. I respect you.' `You!' said the other, in astonishment, but evidently with delight. `Yes, I do. But what we at first took for constitutional vivacity, we have discovered now, to proceed from an insupportable arrogance—self-sufficiency. You have had the vanity to imagine, because we would not take up your boyish gauntlet, every time that it was hurled down, that we dared not, or could not withstand you. What! must men of my age, wrestle with a child, whenever it shall please him; or be bound to admit whatever he says, as true? I speak plainly, young man, for I mean to be understood. Nay, I mean that you shall remember every word, to your dying day.' Fire flashed from the eyes of the younger. His lip trembled, and he stood, measuring the other, from head to foot, as if undetermined whether to fell him to the deck at once, or grapple with him, as he stood, and leap overboard. But the elder heeded it not—took no precaution against it. `As you have your temper,' he continued, `we have ours. It is only yesterday, as you will remember, that that venerable man yonder, the most placid of human beings, was so ruffled by your rudeness and clamour, your shocking impiety and licentiousness, before his children, that he has been miserable, and dissatisfied with himself, ever since. Nay, sir, you need not smile. It is your manner, not your reasoning, that agitates such men. Night after night, have you cleared the cabin, or the deck, by your intemperate disputation, many hours before the time of rest, and sent most of us to bed, with our temples disturbed, and our heads aching. This must be done with, I am determined; (for I am weary of my life, and could not lose it in a better cause, than this of reforming an uncommon young man, and making many human creatures happy for a little time)—I am determined to put a stop to it. I have now done.' The younger man stopped, overawed, amazed. He bit his lips—his whole frame was convulsed—he shivered from head to foot—his hands trembled, and opened, and shut, involuntarily; he actually foamed at the mouth. But, this was his reply.' `Sir, I thank you. You have cut me to the heart, but I thank you. If I deserved all that you have said, —or—I would slay myself, or you, upon the spot. Your manner is insulting, but I forgive you, for the sake of your advice. I do not approve of your conduct, manly as it is; it is ill advised. There were a thousand chances to one, against its being of any use. It was easier for me to kill you on the spot, than to forgive you.' The other started back, in unaffected astonishment. `Young man,' said he, at last, his voice trembling with emotion—`give me your hand. Forgive me. I did not believe you capable of this. Forgive me. I was harsh. Forgive me.' The company, who had been listening, but all pretending sleep, now arose, and gathered round the two. Harold came up, with the boy in his arms: He measured the stranger, inch by inch, with his antagonist. `He is small,' quoth Harold; `but how he stands. He is scarcely larger than I—nor much older. And yet, look at his countenance. I do not; I never could look like him, at such a moment. How calm, and dignified, and thoughtful. The very trembling of his voice, this agitation of his—it is not like that of other men. It is inward, and sorrowful—compassionate, and lonely. There was a dead silence. The young man, whose name, it appeared, was Bolton, turned to depart, saying, as he went; `your lesson has been a most unkind one. But I could brook unkindness from my childhood. I needed it. It was well that it came from you. Had any other dared—' `Dared!—dared what?' said a third person. Bolton turned. He stood before the speaker, as if ready, at the first parting of his lips, to leap, like a blood hound, at his throat. The intruder aimed a blow at Bolton, which Harold received on his arm, and instantly returned with such effect, as to send him reeling against the benches. Bolton turned to rebuke Harold, for his interference. But the stranger interposed. `Have done!' he cried! in a voice that made their very hearts stand still with affright—`officer! call your captain?' The captain was called. `Sir,' said the stranger. (The British commander of a line of battle ship, stood, at the bidding of this extraordinary man, before him, and obeyed him)—`Sir— you will put the first man in irons, that presumes to strike another on board of this ship, while I am here. What! the quarter deck of a three decker, to be made a bear garden of!' VOL. I. D d `Look ye,' says the captain—`look ye, my cocks; if you must fight, why, damme, you shall go into limbo, in pairs. Blast my eyes! if I hear any more of this, on board of his majesty's ship, if I don't lash you down, in couples, upon the sailor's chests, and there you shall fight it out—you shall!—and the boatswain's mate shall stand over you with a cat o' nine tails.' So passed this day; and so, many successive days; till the alighting of a bird, or the approach of a loose weed, became an object of interest to a multitude, of nearly one thousand persons. But, about nine in the morning of a most heavenly day, a squadron of white sails were seen, circling the horizon. Signals were interchanged: and the ship, with the customary precaution of British seamen, was cleared for action. Night came on, without any satisfactory communication. Rockets flew up the sky, then, and were instantly answered, from all points of the compass. Harold's heart beat high. He saw the preparations on board, with intense anxiety. Was this an enemy? At day-light, another squadron appeared, to windward, bearing down, under a press of sail, in a most beautiful style, athwart the wake of his majesty's 84. A part of the first squadron was now discovered to be merchantmen, and it was conjectured, under convoy, as they were seen to make all sail, and crowd off in different directions, while one noble ship ran up, as if to reconnoitre and another hove to, and backed her topsails, in defiance. There was scarcely wind enough to move the ship. Each appeared to manœuvre, for the purpose of cutting off single vessels. It was a moment of breathless anxiety. The stranger and the captain were seen consulting together. Something was determined upon, instantly: as the colours were hauled down; a new set run up; fore, and aft; the matches lighted; and the ship stood off, awhile, as if to fill, and run down, upon her antagonist—a gun!' At this moment, a terrible cry was heard. `The child! the child!'—Harold turned—the railings were lined with passengers. `Leopold was overboard!' The water all around, was instantly covered with casks, spars, furniture, hencoops, &amp;c.—but the child was not to be seen. An instant after, however, the man at the helm shouted that the child was astern, buoyed up by his dress. Harold and Bolton were both overboard, headlong, at the cry—but the vessel—O! she was already at an immeasurable distance! It was some minutes before she could be put about: and when she was, Harold was discovered, battling with the waves, the boy upon his back, and Bolton, apparently exhausted, holding upon a cask, that was incessantly turning. His breath was a continual sobbing —the ship, in returning, ran aside of him. Harold, who was an excellent swimmer, was seen to offer him his hand, but the other rejected it, angrily, and pointed to the boy. The deck was crowded—it was certain death to attempt the rescue—and yet, what mortal could resist the upbraiding of his heart? Another plunge! The stranger, who had not been heard or seen since the accident, now deliberately leaped overboard, disincumbered of his outer dress, and equipped in a singular contrivance, by which, though it was soon evident that he could not swim, he was kept buoyant, till, by vehement exertion, he was just within reach of the poor fellow, who sobbed—outstretched his hands once more, and went down!—a few bubbles rose, and he came up again, gasping for breath, his hair loose on the wave; his eyes shut; and the water all in a foam round him, with the beating of his arms. His presence of mind never seemed to desert the stranger. Harold was near him. He took the child from his back, and directed him, in admiration of his strength and activity, to pursue Bolton. Harold did, and arose, almost out of the water, as he returned from the plunge that he made after the drowning man, as he was sinking for the last time. The early experience of Harold had taught him, that there is no moment so perilous to the sufferer, as when his preserver is just within his reach. It is then, and then, only, that the strength of desperation gives way, all at once. And thus it is, that such cases so often appear miraculous— the drowning body going down the last time, almost always, before it is plucked forth. Boats were run out, and rapidly approaching; for the ship steered wide, in the fear of running some of the poor creatures down. The foremost one approached Harold, with his insensible burden—but the anxiety of all, and each, had well nigh proved fatal to both; for they all rushed to the side, and abandoned their oars, before they were near enough; and the next swell separted them, half a cable's length. What was to be done? Harold himself, grew dizzy with extreme fatigue and disappointment. He was unable to utter a loud word—the drowning man held him so tightly about the throat. The boat came near again—two of the oars fortunately drifted near him. He caught at the nearest, but missed it, and went down—down—with a dead body in his arms, between the calm, beautiful swell, of two enormous waves. They thought that he never would reappear —the sailors leant over the boat in an agony of compassion for the brave fellow, not knowing what to do next —but Providence was for them—a few bubbles appeared—a darker hue in the water near them, which was transparent to an immeasurable depth; and anon, Harold appeared, dragging up his fellow, by his black locks—he had disengaged himself in the depth of the ocean, by violence, and had arisen, as from the grave. They were soon on board—and Harold fainted. But the stranger—where was he? Still of the same imperturbable aspect, sitting by Harold, and chafing his temples. The enemy—(for she was an enemy) it was now recollected, had forborne to open her batteries, although, at one moment, in an admirable position; and all manœuvering and seamanship were sacrificed for awhile, by the Briton, for the safety of a child.' What was the reason? It was now discovered; for she stood toward the ship again, with every man at quarters—glorious! she too, with her glasses, had seen the struggle in the water; and although the first broad, side might send a multitude, shattered and bloody, before the throne of heaven, yet she withheld her thunderbolts, lest she might hurt the innocent, and inoffensive! —glorious! Some more hours were consumed in manœuvering. The two squadrons had now passed entirely out of sight. There was a mortal stillness on board. The bulwarks were stuffed. The ladies and children ordered midships—and there was nothing but the brief orders of the sailing master, to interrupt the awful silence. The enemy ran nearly by! what! was she afraid? After all this preparation, would'nt she fight?—Some ashy faces, and the faces too, of some brave men, looked more cheerful, nevertheless, as she did pass—but— What a manœuvre! She was almost upon them, from the horizon—completely trimmed, and manned—like an apparition! There was a general burst of astonishment, at the beauty and celerity of the movement. And then, the broadside opened! The waters were all in a foam about the Hesiod, (the name of the Briton.) Harold's heart swelled almost to bursting. He was in an agony of delight and terrour. He was shaken almost to dissolution. The heavens and the earth; the sky and the water, were all thundering together. The two ships lay yard arm, and yard arm, at last, in a whirlwind of smoke and flame. The shrieks of the women and children, and of the wounded, were altogether deafening. A bugle rang! It was for the boarders. But lo! they were anticipated. Harold had already driven his battle axe through and through a young sailor, and was now wrestling with an officer, upon the bowsprit—both fell—their comrades slipped in their gore, and tumbled over them—their hands were grappled about each other's throats—Harold was undermost—`mercy! mercy!' cried a female voice; and Harold was abandoned. His foe leaped over him, and left him, bleeding, and fainting, and suspended in the torn rigging, that lay over the side, and dragged in the discoloured water, unconcious of his situation, his peril, or his escape. The thunder and the earthquake still raged above him—he was almost suffocated with smoke and spray —but he was awakened by a soft hand reached down, and stealing over his wounded head. A strange delirium, delicious, and intoxicating, followed the touch. He caught the hand, and pressed it madly and passionately, to his mouth; bloody as it was—wildly imagining that it was the hand of Loena, herself. `Yes! yes!' said his heart—`I am dying, dying; but what of that? Here is she, my beloved, to weep for me! He lifted his eyes, and had just sense enough to discover a face, and to shriek, as if his heart had been pierced by a thousand knives at the same instant! She was wounded the next moment, and fell by his side—the hot blood ran through the scuppers, and smoked upon the water about them, in red bubbles. By a supernatural effort, Harold arose, took up the wounded woman in his arms—regained the bend—slipped, staggered, and fell, amid a heap of wounded and shattered human beings—sobbing out faint and inarticulate cries for assistance—unheard—unperceived!
