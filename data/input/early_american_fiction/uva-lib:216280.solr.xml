      <field name="fulltext">Commercial Ads March 18 1844 The New Orleans papers of the 8th announce the death, in that city, of Sumner Lincoln Fairfield, known extensively for many years as an ambitious votary of the muses. He was a man of genius, undoubtedly, but his mind lacked the stable elements of success, either pecuniary or literary. He thought his genius unappreciated and neglected—gave himself up to repinings, wasted his energies in misdirected struggles with what he chose to consider the coldness and injustice of the world, and finally, abandoning himself to gross and debasing solaces, lived in misery and died in destitution. The one bright feature of his story was the unwearying devotion of his mother, who clung to him through evil and through good, and whose mission of undying love was ended only at the grave.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PREFACE. The cities of Herculaneum, Pompeii, Retina, and Stabiæ, with many beautiful villages, were destroyed by an eruption of Mount Vesuvius, during the first year of the reign of Titus, on the 24th of August, seventy-nine. Buried during more than seventeen hundred years, even their very names were almost forgotten, when the plough of a peasant struck upon the roof of the loftiest and most magnificent mansion in Pompeii; and the excavations of the last fifty years have furnished the tourist, the antiquarian, the novelist, and the poet, with many a subject of picturesque and glowing description. The cities of the dead have not wanted frequent and often faithful historians; every disinterred temple, theatre, statue, pillar, tomb, and painting, has found admirers. It was expedient, therefore, to throw action into a picture at all times impressive, and to delineate without flattery those existing manners, customs, and morals, which, sanctioned as they were, not only by usage, but by legislators and the priesthood, can leave little regret and less astonishment at the terrible overthrow of cities as excessive and not so venial in their crimes as Gomorrah. The founders of Rome, like the Pelasgi of Greece, were outlawed fugitives from almost every nation—the very seminoles of the world. Their earliest laws, discipline, science, and literature, were all created by habitual war. Political ascendancy, acquired by remorseless military skill, was with each the highest good; and hence, though less capricious and somewhat more grateful than the Athenians, there never was a period in Rome, when the people, after long suffering, exacted their rights without incurring the vengeance of the patricians. The aristocracy held the supreme power; in their esteem the commonalty were vassals of the soil. To resist these arrogated privileges, the tribunes instigated factions, and the venerable Forum became the arena of revolt, conspiracy, and blood. The very senators ascended the rostrum spotted with gore. Liberty was defined by philosophers, developed by rhetorical declaimers and adored in the fictions of poesy, but it was never enjoyed. There were grandeur, vast dominions, empires in bondage, triumphal processions, unrivalled wealth, magnificent prodigality and profligacy, but no just freedom. Roman citizenship was national pride, not individual prerogative. The ignorant cannot govern though they may tyrannize; and ancient sages and priests were too wise to instruct the multitude, though they valued uninitiated sectaries; for communicated knowledge would supersede the lucrative occupations and mysterious powers of their successors. Cæsar rose upon the ruins of the consulship as that had risen upon the decemvirate. Authority now became personal, concentrated and unappealable, but otherwise there was little change. The senate had long been the mere market of ambition; the people were mercenaries of serfs; the consuls were colluders of some faction, perpetually renewed, or its obedient slaves; and the victorious commander of the legions, long the arbiter of the Roman destinies, on the field of Pharsalia, merely decorated imperial power with a diadem. Titus was the tenth emperor, and doubtless a just man; but the epithets of exaggerated praise bestowed upon him, sufficiently indicate the character of, at least, seven of his predecessors; and his own brief reign, which was terminated by the poison of his inhuman brother Domitian, demonstrates the morals, humanity, and courage of the age. Therefore, in the picture I have attempted to draw, I have not been intimidated by the victories, arts, literature or mythology of the Romans, but have desired to paint with fidelity the universal licentiousness, which, having infected every heart, left the battlements of the Eternal City ready to fall before the barbarian avenger. Every province of the vast empire rivalled the imperial capital; and almost every proconsul imitated—sometimes even exceeded—the despotism and debaucheries of Caligula and Heliogabalus. The union of civil and military power, while it concentrated the energies of government, conferred upon the provincial commander an irresponsible authority, against which it was folly to remonstrate, and madness to rebel. The fathers of Rome were too corrupt to investigate the sources of their revenue or the characters of its gatherers; and too indolent in patrician profligacy to execute any edicts except such as suited their own haughty yet grovelling passions. The fountain being thus contaminated, its thousand streams distributed corruption over the whole empire; and all, who drank its waters, partook the character of them who watched beside the wellspring. Few of those who wore the Roman crown, died by the ordinance of nature; the Prætorians, like the modern Janizaries and Strelitzes, obeyed the decisions of their turbulent prefects; and what a Sejanus failed to accomplish for himself, a more politic Macro effected for another, through whom he ruled every thing but that imperial folly which ended in assassination. Yet sanguinary as was the ascent, unhappy the possession and quick the downfall of power, the governors of the provinces were less implicated in the royal revolutions than almost any men in Rome. While the Quæstor of the Palatine discovered no defalcation of the revenue, and no rumor of sedition reached the senate, the proconsul remained in his lucrative government during pleasure; and none of all the Conscript Fathers deemed it expedient to examine the condition of the country over which he swayed his iron rod.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">2 THE LAST NIGHT OF POMPEII. CANTO I. Mid mellow folds of softly floating gold, The flowered pavilions of the spirit winds, That waved in music to the Ausonian breeze, And blent, like heart-smiles, with the deep blue vault Of beautiful Campania, like a God, (Titan in ancient dreams, whose faintest smile Elysian splendors breathed through ocean's realm,) Casting aside earth's throbbing dust, to put His diadem of deathless glory on, The sun went slowly down the Appenines. Far up the living dome of heaven, the clouds, Pearling the azure, like a seraph's robe, Wreathed o'er the blessed and beaming face of heaven, And glanced, mid blush and shadow, o'er the sky, Full of the gentle spirit of the air, The mediator of the elements. As if imbued with virgin thought, the leaves Tenderly smiled their loveliness, and sighed, O'er the hushed summer earth, their music, soft As the sky-hymns o'er wandering souls forgiven. The hills cast giant shadows, in whose depth Wild jagged rocks, and solitary floods, And forests gnarled and hoar, looking deep awe, Like the vast deserts of a dream, replied To voices of unresting phantoms, there Till day-dreams, wrapt in dark sublimities. On the fair shores and sea-worn promontories, Where many a Doric palace, proudly built, And overwhelmed by grandeur, silent stood, Save when the twilight waters whispered low Their vigil anthem, childlike slumbered now, In speechless beauty, the last light; afar, The avalanche in the ravine glimmered back The trembling and most transitory glow; The beaked and burnished galleys on the wave With quivering banners hung, and gay triremes Passed by each isle and headland like the shade Of Enna's idol through the realm of Dis. All nature, in her holy hour of love, Lifted in rapture the heart's vesper prayer. And thus from Pompeii's Field of Tombs the voice Of Vesta's priestess, o'er the sepulchres Bending beneath the holy Heaven, sent up The anguish of bereavement, and the doubts Of an immortal mind that knew not yet Its immortality, yet seeking e'er A deathless hope and sighing o'er the pomp Profane of paynim adoration vain. THE VESTAL'S HYMN. Zephyr of twilight! thine elysian breath In spirit music steals through orange groves: Bringst thou no memories from the home of death? No whispered yearnings from departed loves? Fann'd not thy wing, ere stars above thee glowed, The pure pale brow that on my birth-hour smiled? And bearst thou not from Destiny's abode One kiss from mother to her vestal child? Cold sleep the ashes of the heart that breathed But for my bliss—when being's suns were few; And hath the spirit no high hope bequeathed? Or must it drink the grave's eternal dew? Hesper! the beauty of thy virgin light Blossoms along the blue of yon sweet sky— Yet vain my heart soars—from the deep of night No voice or vision thrills my ear or eye. From Vesta's vigil shrine no light ascends Beyond this realm of sin, doubt, grief, and death; Reveals no heaven where meet immortal friends, Shadows no being victor over breath! Sunlight and fragrance, dewbeam and still eve Shed not their bliss and beauty on thine urn! Has earth no hope time never can bereave? No power again to bid the pale dust burn? The rippling rills, the radiant morns, the flowers, Bursting in beauty, showers of iris hues, Starlight and love—the graces and the hours— Each—all must vanish like the dial dews! Budding to wither—lingering to impart Life's hopeless pangs when thought shall sink in gloom— Can song or mythos soothe the shuddering heart? Or e'en the Thunderer's eye illume the tomb? Now from the mountain tent mid ilex woods Or gay pavilions in the elysian vale, Wandered, on twilight air, through clustering vines, The cithern's music and the lute's soft strain Echoed the soul of love-filled melody. The hills seemed living with delight, for there As Summer's burning solstice felt the breath Of Autumn floating o'er its fires, retired, From cities thronged with death, the wise and gay, In fellowship or loneliness, to seek Felicity or wisdom from the woods; And there the dreams of Arcady—the thought, That, in the elder days, inspired the soul Of Phantasie and breathed through Nature's smiles Elysian revelations, clothing earth In mornstar robes of loveliness, became The blest companions of the pure in heart. The rose and purple radiance from the sky Fled like Love's visions or the arrow's plume, O'er the dim isles and sea of Italy, Mid the dark foliage mingling like the hopes Of earth with night-fears, when the shadows, cast From thought, with high and pure revealments blend Of beautiful existence far beyond The mockery and the madness of this life. In shadowy grandeur lay the glorious sea, Whose waters wafted spoils from orient realms, And mirrored Nature's beauty, while dread war Bathed Punic banners in the gore of Rome. The evening isles of love and loveliness Slept in the soothing solitude, wherein The awful intellect of Rome sought peace In grey philosophy while faction poured Its hydra venom, or conspiracy Walked the thronged Forum, dooming, at a glance, The loftiest to extinction; here the bard Unfolded earth's and heaven's mysteries, Creating the world's creed and Fiction's brow Wreathing with the immortal buds of truth. Among the sanctities of groves and streams, The worn and wearied bosom breathed again Its birthlight bliss, and wisdom, born of woe, Uttered its oracles to coming years; And in the midst of all that thrills and charms, Weds beauty unto grandeur, earth to heaven, Here tyrant crime achieved, by nameless deeds, The world's redemption from remorseless guilt. Bland airs flew o'er the faded heavens, and streams, That in the noonday dazzled, and e'en now Drank the rich hues of eventide, purled on With lovelier music, and the green still shores Looked up to the blue mountains with the face— The cherub face of sinless infancy— With hope and joy perpetual in that look; For, mid all changes, still the faded bloom Shall be renewed—the slumbering heart revived. And then the crescent streamed o'er air-winged clouds With an ethereal lustre, and the stars, The dread sabaoth of the unbounded air, From the profound between each downy fold, Gleamed like the eyes of seraphs, from the realms Of immortality beholding earth. Beneath the dying glories of the day, And the unspeakable beauty of the night, Yet in the haunt of peril—the dim home Of dread and danger—looking o'er the domes Of destined Pompeii—stood two shadowy Forms, Pale, yet unfaltering—famished, yet in soul, Fed from the altar of their risen God. One—a tried warrior by his eye and brow And dauntless port, leaned on the shattered ledge Of a Vesuvian cavern, o'er which trailed The matted and dark vines, and thickly hung The cypress and dwarfed cedar, fleckering o'er The twilight of the vestibule with gloom, And shutting from the inner vault, where slept The banned and hunted Nazarenes, all beams Of sunset, mornlight, and meridian, save Light from the living fount of Deity. Beside him, folding in Love's holiness His wasted bosom, on his troubled brow, Pouring the radiance of her dark eyes, stood A Hebrew captive, dragged amid the spoils And splendors of Moriah, when the hour Of Desolation fell on Zion's towers, To swell the victor's wild array and add Another cup of vengeance and despair To imperial, merciless, world-wasting Rome. There Mariamne clung to Pansa's breast. The melancholy loveliness of Love, That dares the voiceless desert and inspires The forest solitude, around her hung Like star-gemmed clouds around an angel's form; On her pale brow the very soul of faith Rested as by its shrine; and earth's vain pride And triumph from the vaulted refuge fled Where Hope breathed Love's own immortality. Like her, the sun-clothed vision, in whose crown Gleamed the twelve orbs of glory as she stood 3 Amid the floating moon's young shadowy light, When the red sceptered Dragon cast from heaven The blossomed beams of the universe, and watched His spoil in breathless rapture; so, mid grief And want and loneliness and danger stood The daughter of the east, in every woe Fearless, in every peril quick in thought And action, whether dread calamity Waited the wanderings of her wedded love, Or through the clouds of fear upon her came. Thoughts, winnowed from the gross and grovelling dust Of earth, and glistering with the hues of heaven, Passed o'er their mingled spirits in the depth Of the hoar Appenines; 1 and thus the heart Of the changed Roman spake, whose home had been The tented battlefield, whose joy, the spoil Of nations gasping 'neath the banner folds Of conquest, ere amid the flames and shrieks Of Solyma, he heard the Voice that fills Infinity, with immeasurable awe, And worshipped mid the scorn of pagan hands. Relentless as the edict he obeyed, His dauntless soul, in other years, had roamed Through carnage, and, in triumph, mocked the moans Of fallen mortality, as his fellows did, The legions of the loveless; but the faith, Whose founder wept o'er doomed and ruthless foes, Sunk on his bosom as the sunset sinks Upon the wild and savage mountain peak, Clothing its barrenness with beauty!—Thus His saddened but serene mind communed now. “Oh, the still, sacred, soothing light that bathes The blue, world-studded heavens—while the breath Of Antumn gushes music, and inspires The purified and thrilled spirit with the power To cast aside the thrall of flesh and soar To converse with the seraphim and prayer And sacrifice beneath the throne of God! The madness and the misery, that rend The heart no skill can renovate, come not Within the bosom's temple that imbibes The oracles of Truth in every breeze. Thou needest not thy tephilim 2 to lift Thy thoughts within the veil, nor seek I more The prestiges of augurs to impart The destined future, nor vain amulets To guard what He, who gave, can well preserve. Look, Mariamne! on the dimpled sea, That slumbers like the jasper waters seen In the apocalypse of Patmos, hang The crowding sails of merchant barks delayed, The altars at their prows casting pale gleams, While by the dagon deities of earth, The terrible apotheoses, wrought From desolating passions, vainly now The mariners invoke the gale to bear Their treasures to the imperial mart—and lo! The living leaves stir not the gemdew, wept By twilight o'er the forest, in reply.” Rapt by the charm and majesty—the bloom And dreamy verdure of the world and skies— Yet looking far beyond them, thus replied The High Priest's banished child unto the thought Of the baptized and scorned Decurion. “Methinks, my Pansa!—as we gaze around— The shadows of the hoar and giant woods, The sea's unearthly and hushed gleam, the eyes Of the unlimited and soul-peopled heaven, Thus calm and awful, and the silence, throned Amid the universe, sink on my soul With an unwonted dread, and throng my brain Like breathless ministers of doom. Among The woven cedar-boughs and oak canopies, The pale green moss, thick shrubs and mazy vines Of these dark rocks, a spirit seems to fill The air with revelations none can hear, Save they who, fearing God, fear not vain man. Like the mysterious and unvoiced Name, Upon the white gem written, which none beheld But the anointed, fearful characters Seem to my startled vision forming now Among you dense and thought-winged thunder-clouds. Whose dusky peaks ascend above the hills; And, see! with what a brow of majesty Vesuvius, through the bland transparent air, And vivid moonlight, o'er our vigil bends! Dwells there not terror in earth's breathlessness? And peril in the slumber of the mount?” Sadly the Roman turned his gaze below Upon the fated city, gleaming now With countless lights o'er pageantries and feasts, That flared in mockery of the hallowed heaven, Then answered mournfully his dreading bride. “The happy deem not so—discern not ought Beyond their splendor, fame and luxury; For, knowing not the evil, which, as clouds Impart a lovelier glory to the skies, (Else dim with sultriness) invests all good With loftier attributes; they cannot fear The forfeiture of wealth, or any change To adverse fortune; mark the gorgeous pomp, The maskings, orgies, agonalia now In mirth and madness echoing o'er our watch From Pompeii's lava streets; her sculptured domes Flash back the torchlights of the riot throng, And countless chariots, rivalling their God Of Morn, are hurled along the trembling side Of this most awful mount, as if the fire Had never wreathed to heaven and poured the heart Of earth in blood-red torrents! By yon gate, Towers the proud temple of the idol first Made and adored by earth's first Rebel—him Called Nimrod, and exalted to a God By the debased and impious sons of Ham.— There Parian columns and Mosaic floors And golden shrines and lavers, and proud forms Wrought by Praxiteles with godlike skill, And pictures glowing with unshadowed charms To tempt, or mythologic pomp to awe The enthusiast and the sceptic, can attest Idolatry's magnificence. Within, The secret stair—the victim, whose wild shrieks Are oracles—the flamen at his wine Or darker deeds of sacrilege, while throngs Of blind adorers, manacled without By fear's inflicted madness, bend in awe And pile first fruits and gold around her shrine— These are the illusions and the destinies Of Isis and her earthborn vassals, love! Think they of aspects men believe they rule? Think they of perils in their revelry? Know they the God whose least respected works They mock, as deities, by all excess Loathsome and nameless to the human ear?” “The destined hour of justice and despair, When they shall gather wisdom, flings its shade Upon the dial of the conqueror's doom.” Thought hurried fast through Mariamne's soul. “Said not the Christ from the bright Olive Mount, Looking in sorrow on the temple clothed With peerless glory, that the Holy Place Should be defiled—the city trampled—all Its princely dwellers captive, slain, or strewn Like sear leaves o'er the unreceiving world, Or scorned for uttering creeds the torture taught? And not one stone upon another left To mark where once the sanctuary stood? Alas! she sleeps in desolation's arms, The city of my childhood, and not one Of all the pleasant haunts, the palmgrove plain Of Sharon and Siloam's holy fount, And Lebanon's pavilioned wood—which thought, At morn or even twilight, sanctified, Looks from the ruins of my home! but thou, My Pansa! art my home and temple now, And the Atoner, whom my people slew, The God of this wrecked heart—wrecked when it felt Its father slain, its race to bondage sold Beneath the patriarch's Terebinth! alas! That bigot faction—pride unquenched by woe— And thanklessness and treachery and wrath, Perpetuated by all punishment, And, more than either, the one awful crime That ne'er shall be forgiven, till the faith— They mocked and shall mock, ages hence, the same Without a country, law, chief, priest and home They were, in glory, with them all—shall fill Their dark and desolated minds with light— That these led on the Roman to the spoil And allied with his bands to our despair! —But I do grieve thee, love! by selfish plaint, And shut my soul to knowledge of the rites And ministrations of thy monarch race. Power and impunity with them, as all, Forestall, I dread, their death-doom; yet again As we behold Campania's loveliest realm Unfolded far beneath us, let me learn The polity and faith of Italy. Yon vast pile, in the centre, looking o'er The Appian with a mild magnificence”—? “'Twas once, ere Freedom perished, and the car Of conquest bore the tyrant to his throne, The thronged and venerated home of Right, Liberty's temple, where the tribune's voice Forbade the consul's edict, and none dared, Without their will, to decimate for war, Or spoil, in peace, the conscious citizen. Now, beautified by Parian colonnades, And jetting fountains and immortal busts Of Rome's immortal mind, when power, conferred In peril, was resigned in safety's arms, Mid the Mosaic corridors and halls, And priceless trophies of the matchless thought Of Zeuxis and Apelles, and the forms Of Phidias, warrior statues, giant steeds, And consuls stern in look, austere in life, Dispensing bondage from the Capitol, 4 Or tributary diadems to earth— Now o'er this pomp of intellect and might The serpent spirit of a helot race, Licking the dust of purple tyranny, And crushing in its poison folds all thought That dares be fetterless, and dreads but guilt— Leaving the slime of ruin, with the hiss Of shame and desolation, ever glides. Mark the long pillared ranges to the east— (A sceptered figure overtops the dome, Her brazen scales are superfluities—) In the Ausonian days ere heaven revoked Its holiest gift to man; ere granite gods, Sphynxes, cabiri, 3 apes and crocodiles Became corrupted nature's deities, There reigned Astraea, bright Aurora's child, The Titan's seraph—gentle e'en to crime, Radiant in beauty to the Good; the clouds Of passion never darkened her sweet brow, Revenge and hate and venal compact ne'er Confronted her calm look of sanctity. Then the Basilicæ were temples meet For prayer and hymn to the Divinity, And majesty and wisdom, peace and love Dwelt with a sad yet just humanity. Alas, for the brief vision! and alas For the world's madness! giant evil rushed Through wrecked hearts and crushed spirits and o'erspread All realms with unmasked vice, impurities Unnameable, atrocities beyond The untaught conception of the savage, till, Casting earth's soil and burden from her wings, The goddess rose to the elysian throne She left to meet derision and despair. Then grovelling men, amid abasements, groped Through sacrilege and malady and vice, The agonies of guilt without its shame, Remorselessness and misery, to their home— The sepulchre of painted infamies! Thus felt, though feigning, pagan Rome's best minds: And since the fated hour when faction raised The tyrant's beacon banner and the blood Of Cæsar stained his rival's pillar, none Have stayed the deluge of unpunished wrong. The Ambracian waters 4 were not deeper dyed Than judgment in yon courts; there's not a stone, That bears not witness, to the soul, of woe, Injustice, calumny and death; wrung tears Have stained the Prætor's seat of perfidy; And sighs unsolaced through the long arcades Echoed like voices of accusing ghosts; And hopeless shrieks ascended from the cells Beneath the proud tribunal, where the will Of one, that cannot be arraigned, dooms all To endless anguish or unwitnessed death. Alas, my Mariamne! while I gaze On those most dreaded mansions, burning fears Thrill my awed bosom, lest this mountain vault, Dismal and dripping—the dark home of want— And guiding to the abyss of flame or flood, Perchance—may fail to shield us from the grasp Of Diomede's apparitors! 5 forefend, O Heaven! the hour of our betrayal! once My stricken and stunned soul beheld the death— Let us within, my love! my heart misgives Even at the imagination of the power, Ferocity and wantonness of him, Whose sire—(and ne'er had father truer son) Sejanus taught, Tiberius trusted in, Caligula exalted; Nero loved This subtle, quick Sicilian, and all since Upon the imperial throne have left in place Pompeii's Prætor—for his heart feels not! Honored by these, what have not we to fear? His minion's glance is ruin unto both! My life, his prey, thy beauty—stand not so, Beyond the shadow of the precipice! His seekers are abroad—the assassin games Of you vast amphitheatre will feast, Ere long, the merciless idolaters! Enter the cavern, Mariamne! hark! Some lichens fell from the steep rocks o'erhead— A sandal hath dislodged them—yet no eye Of mortal may discern us from the crag That beetles there—again! I hear the fall Of guarded steps—so, softly, love! within!” Darkness along the rugged crypt—(wherein The pard had sorted with the serpent, ere The Roman Convert made his home there, sought By the fierce demon of the idol faith)— Floated in wreaths, and round the jutting rocks, Whence trickled the hill fountains, drop by drop, Mocking the pulses of each lingering hour, Hung in its home of centuries; but now Gloom e'en more terrible from thunder clouds Rushed on the tempest's wings o'er every star Of bright blue ether and the laughing earth, (Breathed o'er by Zephyr from his vesper throne, Late, when the oreads danced upon the mount,) And winds in moaning gusts, like spirits doomed, Swept through the cavern; and the giant trees Through their vast canopies their voices cast Upon the whirlwind; and the Appenines Loomed through the ghastly midnight, shadowing forms Like earth-gods in the revel of their wrath, Limitless and robed in vengeance hoarded up Through ages of quick agony; and, whirled In fury o'er the crags, huge boughs and leaves And dust, leaving the gnarled grotesque roots bare, Quivered along the sky; and lightning leapt O'er cloven yet contending woods, from mass To mass of all the surging sea of clouds, That rioted amid the firmament, Flashing like edicts from the infinite Mind Of Godhead; and from sea, shore, cliff and vale A deep wild groan in shuddering echoes passed Through the earth's heart, and met the crash and howl Of momentary thunders in mid air. In silence from the moss couch of their cell, Mid the deep arches of the grotto, prayer Ascended from the pale lips but tried hearts Of earth's unfriended exiles—heaven's redeemed; And there, as o'er their voiceless orisons The wild tornado's music rushed, the Faith Sublime, which through all torture and all dread The Christian martyr in heaven's triumph bore, Pervaded every thought that soared beyond The doubt and fear and anguish of their fate. The first vast masses of dark vapor poured Their deluge, and the torrents from ravines And precipices hurried, in wild foam, To channels bright with verdure and dry beds Of mountain lakes, flinging their turbid floods Down the deep boiling chasm and with the sea, Now hurling its tumultuous waves along The echoing shores and up the promontories, Conflicting for the masterdom. Each glen, Tangled with thorns and shrubs, and each defile, O'erhung with jagged cliffs, to the dread hymn Of the night storm, shouted their oracles; And from the summit of Vesuvius curled A pyramid of dusky vapor, tinged With a strange, smothered and unearthly light. Portents and prophecies more awful fell On every vigilant and awed sense than e'er, From Pythia shrieking on the tripod, sent Terror and madness to the undoubting heart. But, while the hollow dirge of the strong blast Startled the dreaming world, the unruffled minds Of the disciples with the Paraclete Communed, and gathered from the cross new power O'er famine, danger, loneliness and death. “Thou fear'st not now, my Pansa! though the Mount Unquenchable beneath us quakes; thy dread Of human wrath—consorts it with thy trust In God? thine eye shrinks not when all the heavens Blaze, and thine ear shuts not when thunders burst, Shocking the immensity; why fear'st thou man?” “I know him; knowledge brings to all or hate Or scorn or apprehension, as his deeds Or our own nature waken: He, who died For crime not his, hath taught my else fierce heart Humility; derision and revenge Assail me not, and, therefore, fear invades My too acquainted spirit when the shade Of Diomede along my lone thoughts stalks. But from his revelations I do know The Maker, and his loftiest name is Love, And that consists not with the sceptic's dread. Man, gifted with a might above all law, With every passion by impunity And rivalry of imperial guilt inflamed. (And such is this proconsul) must become A dreaded despot, and the helpless heart, That weds a persecuted faith and loves A banished mortal, who on earth to him Is as elysium, must from peril quail, And shudder e'en at shadows menacing.” “Yet paynim hate but hurls our thoughts to heaven,” (Said Mariamne, e'en in woe like hers, Thinking the thoughts which Miriam from the shores Of Egypt's sea breathed o'er the tyrant host,) “Their fountain first and final home, as feigned Thy poet, of the Titans, thrown to earth By might supernal, yet unconquering: They from the bosom of their mother sprung With renovated strength and added wrath And hourly towering majesty of mien. Man may destroy, but cannot desecrate; May mock, but never can make vain our faith; And if our hopes, like Christ's own kingdom, are Not of this world, why should we linger on In this unworthy fear, and shun the crown Laid up for martyred witnesses of truth? Let the worst come in the worst agonies! We shall not part, my love! but for an hour; 5 Nor shall we leave—the spoil of heathen scorn— Bright sons and gentle daughters to endure Inherited affliction, homeless need, Perpetuated vengeance; round our hearts, In the dread trial hour of tortured flesh, The parent's matchless and undying love, With all its blest endearments, and the charms Of budding childhood's rainbow pleasantries, Gushings of the soul's springtime, falling o'er Maturer years, like sunbright dews of heaven, Will never cling and chain our daunted minds To earth's vain interests. We shall depart Like sunbows from the cataract, renewed By luminaries that have no twilight—where Winter and hoar age, doubt, care, strife and fear, The desert and the samiel, the realm Of flowers and pestilence, the purple pomp And tattered want of human life are not. What say the Greek and Latin sages, love? What Judah's peerless monarch, 6 mid the wealth, The radiance and the perfumes and the power, The majesty of thrones and diadems, And the excess of mortal pleasure, said In his immortal wisdom (how 't was soiled By passion, in his age, for idol charms, Heaven knows and sorrows o'er humanity,) Ambition, pride, pomp, pleasure—all Are but the vanities that tempt man on To shame, satiety and death—or worse, Reckless dishonor and shunned solitude, Living with dire remembrances of joy.” “The God, my Mariamne! that for guilt, Incurred in other states or other worlds, Ere the great cycles brought our being here, (As some have deemed, if erring or inspired I know not) clothed our spirits in this robe Of frail flesh, subject to necessities From birth to burial, ne'er debased the mind Unto the body's weakness, yet left not Thought, at all seasons, master of our clay. Wander not oft the wisest? sink not oft The strong? and blench the fearless? and delay To reason with blasphemers the most skilled? And tamper with temptation, the most pure? In the imparted strength of heaven I trust, When the last trial of my faith shall come, That the disciple will not prove apostate. But having thee, my bride! e'en from the mouth Of this wild Cacus vault, that looks beneath Into the chaos of the mountain gorge, The air, the forest, the blue glimmering waves, The meadows with their melodies, the cliffs Curtained by countless waving vines, or dark With desolate magnificence, o'erwhelm My soul with grandeur, love and beauty, till, Uttering to thee the bliss which nature breathes, And thrilled by her seraphic eloquence, I mingle with the tenderness and bloom, The music, majesty, and loveliness Of her unfolded scenes, and shrink to meet The power that rends away these charms—this love So sternly proved through each uncertain hour Since from the sanctuary wreathed with flame I snatched thee, as the Judge of that wild night Did from the dark faith of the Pharisee. Life pure amid corruption, will to bear Protracted evil, gratitude for all The gifts of God, and prayer and praise in grief, May prove a sacrifice to heaven not less Than all the tortures of the martyrdom. The tempest passes, and the night wears on; The dome of heaven is filled with prophecies! With voices low, but heard where breathless thoughts Are oft the most accepted music, let Our evening hymn ascend, and then to rest.” THE MIDNIGHT PRAYER. From the wild cavern's still profound, From cliffs that bend o'er viewless flame, Our spirits soar beyond the bound Of being to THY hallowed name. In gloom and peril, God! thou art Our hope amid the lion's lair, And from the desolated heart, Redeemer! hear our midnight prayer! The lustres of our lives are few, On darkened earth, our bliss still less, Yet daybeam fragrance, evelight dew Hear our heart-hymns in lone distress: By no green banks, as prayed our sires, Our thoughts win heaven to Time's despair, But we are heard by seraph choirs— Hear thou, O Christ! our midnight prayer! No magian charms or mystic dreams, Or Delian voices, uttering doubt, By fountains dim and shadowy streams, The fear, the awe of doom breathe out; By shrines, red bolts have sanctified, While dragons haunted meteor air, We worship not as shadows glide— Redeemer! hear our midnight prayer! The breathing earth, the gleaming heaven, The song of sea, mount, vale, and stream, While dimness waves o'er holy even, Blend our glad souls with beauty's beam; But darkness, danger, torrents raise Our hope to Thee, Death-victor! where In virgin light fly tearless days— Redeemer! hear our midnight prayer! The bard bereaved from Orcus' gloom, Through Hades, led his love to light, And thine adorers from thy tomb Drink glory in their being's night; More blest to need, as thou didst, Lord! Than be the Phrygian monarch's heir, Wanting the rapture of thy word— Redeemer! hear our midnight prayer! Judea's incense-hills are dim And silent, where the song went up; Hushed holy harp and temple hymn— The slayer drinks the spoiler's cup! Earth o'er the sophist's vision sighs, O'er deeds, king, priest, and people dare, And wilt thou not from pitying skies, Redeemer! hear our midnight prayer! Loosed from dark homage unto Fear, Imaged in lar and teraphim, And Delphian voice and Ebal seer, Thy bright revealments round us swim, Pouring upon the path we tread, Though perill'd, lone, and rough and bare, Light that inspires the martyred dead! Redeemer! hear our midnight prayer! In sleep and vigil, guard and guide, In secret quest of earthly food, From outward foes and inward pride, And the fiend's wiles in solitude! O'er idol rites Thy radiance pour, Till, like the myriad worlds of air, The Universe, as one, adore! Redeemer! hear our midnight prayer! “What terrible and ghastly blaze flares through The cavern, filling its abyss with flame?” Said Pansa, startling from the grotto's gloom, As the last gentle breathings of the song Whispered along the arches, and with step Like hunted antelope he sprung to the edge Of his dark home of banishment. “Behold! The surges of the tempest fluctuate In fierce tumultuous masses 'neath yon orb Of livid fire that from the north careers O'er the astonished and convulsed firmament! Nor terror nor surprise is in thy look, For well thou know'st that awful herald, seen Through uncreated shadows of events By Him who mourned o'er ruin while the pomp Of thy Jerusalem before Him glowed. The comet! meteor of despair to man! Like a condemned, demolished world of flame, With a vast atmosphere of torrent fire, It traverses immensity with speed Confounding thought, hurled on by viewless power Omnipotent and unimagined, robed In dreadful beauty—heaven's volcano—home, Perchance, of those gigantic spirits cast From holiness to hopelessness for pride. Lo! how it sweeps o'er the sky's ocean! wreaths Of purple light along its borders mount What seem innumerable colonnades Wrought by the seraphim, most meet to bear A temple huge as Atlas; and the hues Deeper and lovelier than prismatic lights, Curl o'er the quivering arch as if to roof The vast mysterious fabric of the sea Of clouds that throng eternity, to which Egypt's most mighty pyramid were not More than a tinted shell to Caucasus. Are those, that swirl like wrecks amid the surf, Vast mountains wrenched from their abysses, thrown From one fire billow's bosom and engulphed To be again hurled on another's crest? Lo! through the sky, air-rocks, hissing and red, From the volcanic worlds of heaven descend! What terrors of infinity they speak! What revelations of undying power! What be yon dark and spectral images That through the bickering fiery waves move slow Yet haughtily? oh, what a furnace glare Rolled o'er the shadows then, and left their forms Radiant with ruin! and above, methinks, Broad wings of diamond brilliance wave and flash. Gift me thy wisdom, Love! what said thy sires Of such revealments of divinity?” 6 “Seldom they came and brandished o'er the world Their flickering and serpent tongues of flame: Seldom—for generations, centuries passed, And men saw not the burning heavens o'erwrit In gory characters of forewarned fate. Yet deemed our sages, least of dust, that all The meteors warring with the myriad worlds, That circle through the abyss of air, had been, Ere man, time, death, or sin was, stars of bloom, Casting their beauty and their fragrance on The zephyr, hymning on their flight through space The Maker, and awaiting life to fill Their groves and valleys with the prayer and song. Yon shattered mass of boiling minerals Thus in its whirlwind madness driven on O'er shocked and startled ether, star-skilled eyes Of the Captivity's prophetic eld,— (When from the Temple in his triumph all Jehovah's holy shrines to wanton Jove Were borne by the proud Flavian victor) saw Beneath the horizon, ere, in arcs and wreaths And pillars canopied by thunder folds, The spiral torrents of volcanic fire Precipitated through the sphere of earth. Much in dread visions when between the wings Of cherubim the Glory rested—much In banishment and desert solitude— And more in ruin to the soul of seers Was given to know; more than all human thought By all its systems can impart to man. Yet with least erring eye the Apostle saw, What time he felt the martyr's hovering crown. The cohorts of the conqueror, when we trod— (A banished nation, from our birth-soil rent, Helpless and homeless, hurled upon the spear),— The path of bondage, paused beneath the hill Of sycamores, when the meridian sun Flung his fierce arrowy splendors; and around The cool o'ershadowed fountains, scowling on The scorched and agonizing captives, lay The imperial legions, casting bitter scorn And ribald merriment on each who passed Among their stern battalions to assuage His deadly thirst:—scarce deigned plebeian hate This solitary solace;—and they held Each pilgrim by the beard to bid him bow In worship to the dread Labarum, 7 ere, In terms of mockery, they questioned him Of the sacked temple's holy spoils—what gold The chalices, cups, lavers, shrines would bring To the vast coffers of the Palatine. With lips unmoistened, weary, sick in soul, I turned aside into a dreary rift Of rock o'erbowered with briar and aconite, To pray and perish, for I had on earth No friend! my father, on that morn, had laid His weary head upon my breaking heart And died. They bound him to a blighted tree Upon a desert crag, and, to my shrieks Shouting, “The traitor may forget the path The Avenger treads! let him look on to Rome!” The savage spoilers dragged me from his corse. Thus to the earth I cast me, wailing low, When a hand lifted me, and I beheld A form, a face, so towering, worn and full Of blended intellect and sanctity, Of majesty and mildness, that, methought, 'Twas the Love-Angel! and his look o'erspread My soul with joy inscrutable, he held The very spirit so; and then his voice Passed through the mind's depths like a cherub hymn. “Daughter!” he said, “one doom is sealed in blood! The Holy City, stained by guilt, defiled By treason, sacrilege and rapine, sleeps In dust—and who but God shall bid her wake? Yet judgment tarries not, because the arm Of Rome's proud Desolator worked the will Of heaven, fulfilling his own ruthless lust. Thou shalt behold the destiny of them Who from the furnace of ambition cast Their brands of ruin o'er the world—for me— The numbered hours rush on. My daughter! hear! Thou art the child's child of one great in all That magnifies the mind and fills the heart With earth's sublimest influences—all That clothes our flesh with spotless robes, and claims Man's loftiest veneration, and heaven's love. Gamaliel, thy wise ancestor”— My soul Glowed at the name, and, gazing on that face Which never blanched with fear though tyrants frowned, Nor in success exulted, proud of gifts, Quickly I said, “Who should have talked with him, Master in Israel, and yet survive When all, save this wrecked spirit, dream not now?” “'Tis Saul of Tarsus!” said he, with his eyes Downcast in pale contrition: “he who first Bore faggot, brand and crucifix, and watched O'er the red garments of the martyred saint; And, when the Temple's vail was rent, and heaven Shuddered as the pale King of Shadows waved His sceptre o'er the Son of God,—was held Aloft, amidst the people, to behold Him by our sires blasphemed and slain.—If toil, Baffled temptation, patient suffering, Perils by land and wave, and every ill Mortality hath borne—added to zeal And many years of vigil thought, may hope For pardon of my crime, I have not lacked. But, daughter! as I rested on my path, Girdled by foes exulting, I beheld Thee clinging to thy parted sire, and sought In secret to unfold, now in thy grief, The sole Redemption our lost fathers spurned.”” She paused as on its wandering orbit now Rushed madlier the lost star, and, gazing, cried; “—But mark red Ruin's summoner! beneath The quivering zenith and the zodiac dimmed By his storm glories, how the herald scorns The dominations of the dust, and dares The loftiest hierarchies of the heaven! Ghastly with lava light, the molten clouds In cloven masses swirl before his path, And with the crash and uproar of the war Of all the antagonizing elements, The demon comet cleaves the shuddering air!” “And now the fiend-king of the meteor flings His glance on the voluptuous wantonness Of Baiae and Pausylipo, upon The fairest bosom of earth's beauty laid To stain, defile and desecrate! beyond, The waters of Parthenope, along The curved and blossomed shores, from the dark brow Of the Misenum to Surrentum rocks And Capreae's isle of carnage, curl and moan, Darkened with gory hues; and on the expanse So beautiful in crystal claritude On yester morn, the trailing glare hangs now With tempest gloom contending, yet unmixed. The promontories and proud Appenines Seem to uplift their precipices o'er The wild air and affrighted sea in dread; And the deep forests, quaking yet beneath The Alpine torrent blast, through all their clouds Of leaves, drink the dark crimson streams that pour In lurid cataracts of flame from heaven: And every breathing thing—man, beast, tree, flower— Pants in the siroc that from Lybian sands Hastens to mingle with the withering breath Of yon gigantic world of Death!—my frame Is numbed by torpor, yet the terror holds My spirit captive to the majesty Of the unearthly Desolator!—Love! Thou with the great Apostle didst commune— O God! I saw him die!—the prophet said?” “ “Fulfilled, by Christian faith, the Law, whose voice Was judgment to our fathers, by the blood Of the One Victim unto all becomes The very soul of Love!” Thus he began, And with an angel eloquence, that thrilled My humbled heart, interpreted the law, That spake in thunders from the Desert Mount,— He, the Awakener of nations, whose high gifts, E'en in the grandest spheres of fame, had won The palm and laurel crown, but that in vain Cajoling tempters spread their blandishments And the seducings of apt sophistries Tangled their meshes round him. Affluence, Dominion o'er the treasures and the thoughts Of traitor worshippers, the feigned awe breathed By vassal sycophants through tainted courts, Thronged temples, porticoes, and schools of seets, He cast aside as winds do dust to dust. He felt his intellect's supremacy, And shrunk from moulded clay that lipped his name In interested ecstacies—he knew Himself and sought not other knowledge here. In place of men's dissembled treacheries, He, clothed with immortality's own light, Pictured the Passion, spread the Eucharist, Bade peril and the equinox obey, Soothed the quick pangs of lonely malady, Warded the fold of faith assailed, and stood In every danger on the vanward tower To watch, guard, counsel, lead, bear scorn, and die! Brief was our converse, for the Flavian trump, In triumph echoes, startled the great host. But, from that hour, through agony and shame, I have not trembled to confess the Word, Whose smile is, e'en in the worst evil, heaven. “Farewell! my captive child!” he said, “when power Purples the rills with Christian sacrifice, And wanton crime mocks thy unpitied moans, Forget not Calvary and Gethsemane! Forget not that my eye beholds e'en now, Down the dark lapses of Time unconceived, A terrible atonement of the doom Knelled o'er the domes of Salem; wildly o'er Infinitude the vision rushes—earth With shrieks of wrath and quick convulsions hails 7 The herald of despair—it whirls and leaps, Like living madness now, and tosses o'er Unterminating and unsounded air Perpetual deluges of flame, to warn The scoffer and the rioter, who mark No beam beyond their revel glare! Farewell! Desolate daughter of a slaughtered sire! Forget not! and the Paraclete console Thy lingering sorrows! mine are almost done!” The fountain of my heart o'erflowed; I looked, Yet never more beheld the godlike brow Of Christendom's apostle; through the shades Of the descending cavern slowly waved His mantle, the white turban seemed to hang A moment in the gloom; his sandalled feet Sent back a few low sounds—and he had passed Unto his mission and his martyrdom! But tell me, love! beneath this ghastly light, The story of his doom 8—how passed his soul From torture into triumph when the flesh Clung round the spirit in its agony?” “In calm magnificence—in meekness fit To awe earth's congregated dynasties, From gloom to glory, through its martyrdom, It passed—triumphing mid the jeers of men!” Said Pansa, casting on the o'erhung crags And piles of rifted scoriæ half green'd o'er, (Beauty embracing ruin), mid the intense hush Of o'erworn nature, glances of quick thought, As silently he caught faint smothered sounds Like breaths held back, and then, at intervals, Gasping in sobs, like night sighs of the surf. With startled ear, strained eye and quivering brow, Listened the Christian; but the dells lay still In their green blessedness, the hills looked down From their cold solitudes; above, the flame Of the banned star flared far and dim—beneath, Lay Pompeii, folded in the sleep that flings Oblivion o'er the exhaustion of desire; And, breathing terror from his burdened heart, He thus portrayed the passion of the Saint. “No psalteries or cymbals poured their waves Of music round his death-hour; no grand hymn Gushed from the tabret, and no gentle voice Of sorrow from the harp, to wail his doom. Alone amid his slayers and the foes Of Him they crucified, Paul calmly stood, Nor daring pagan hate nor dreading it, His white hair streaming on the autumnal wind; His countenance, treached o'er by thought and care And toil and suffering, gathered, as he looked Upon the Prætor on his throne of power, The grandeur of his youth, the matchless light Of a triumphant intellect that grasped An immortality of bliss, and feared No mortal agony when joy was death. `Thou art a Christian?' Paul held up the Cross. `Thou art a Hebrew?' `Ay, I was, and worse.' `Thou art a Traitor?' `Not to God or man!' Cried the Apostle, and his monarch form Rose from the ruins of his years, and stood, Like the unpeered statue of Olympian Jove, Before the quailing Paynim. `Edicts, hurled By Agrippina's son, had Rome a soul, E'en from blasphemed humanity would call For vengeance on the utterer. Where's the guilt Of thought? the crime of faith, whose very soul Is low-voiced worship and still charities? The loftiest mind most loves humility! The imperial ban ('twas uttered by the banned) Leaves deeds untouched but criminates the thought; Hales famished, homeless and (for this vain world) Hopeless believers of an humble faith, To judgment, not to trial, and allows The apostacy, it arraigns as crime Death or denial! is the only law Of Rome, whose wings are o'er the world, to men So poor, they have no pillow, and so few, They have no power; and yet the Palatine Fears they—they may subert its giant might! Is truth so terrible to the `immortal gods,' That they in triumph tremble at a voice? Dreads the fierce Thunderer the cicada's song? Or your gay god of Revels, lest the charm Of his wreathed thyrsus may depart when woods And caverns are the palaces, and rills And berries all the banquet of his foes? Yet none of all thy fabled deities, Save hirsute fauns and lonely oreads, Behold our rites, or need shrink to behold. How should conspiracy consort with want And weakness so extreme, they lack the power To lift the dying head or bear the corse Beyond the grotto where they weep and pray? And who of all Rome's judges can arraign The Christian for a deed that could design Possession of a hamlet? or a hut? We seek no empire save untrammelled thought; We court no patron save The Crucified; We win no crown save that of martyrdom.' `Smite, silence the blasphemer!' shrieked the judge, Robing his fear in wrath; `too long we waste The Empire's time—chain the conspirator! And, lictors! guard his cross from slaves, and all The baser multitudes that throng to hear The maniac treasons of the Nazarenes. Hoar breeder of sedition, thou must die!' `Nature said that when I was born, and God, Ere that, a thousand ages, when sin rose From Hades; not in vain have all the power, Splendor and guilt of Rome before me passed In danger yet in solitude, and now I fold unto my bosom that deep death I never sought nor feared, and thank the ruth Of that derision which ordains the Cross. The master of your vast—of every realm, Sea, earth and sky hold, taught me by His groan That the last breath was agony, but He Hath sent the Paraclete to o'ershadow all Who perish by his passion, and I go, Purple idolater! having wandered long Through many years of weariness, to rest, Where, couldst thou ever share my bliss, this hour, With less of anguish, would pass o'er my soul!' Then led they him unto 9 the Accursed Field Beyond the Patriot's Precipice, mid bands Of mailed Prætorians, bearing in the blaze Of noon Cæsar's Labarum (ne'er unfurled But in the triumph's tempest;) in the van The aruspices in purple trabeæ walked, 10 Their oakleaf chaplets waving: then in throngs, The Luperci, the maddened priests of Mars, In crimson togas and broad burnished plates Of brass that mirrored carnage, followed quick. And the wild flamens of Cybele, stained By the red vintage, and the countless crowd Of magi, augurs, senators and slaves, Paphians and vestals, through the marble streets, From dusky lanes and sculptured palaces, Temple and forum and Cimmerian den, Outpoured in pageantry or squalid want, Like Scylla's whirlpool floods, to feast on death. 'Twas ever thus in Rome; she nursed her horde Of bandits, from the first, on blood, and war, Wedding with carnage, wrote her very creed In groans, and wrought her gods from myriad crimes. So on they led the martyr stooping low Beneath the felon cross, his glorious brow, Oft wet with dungeon dew, soiled by the dust Of the armed cohort, yet his undimmed eye Flashing its birthlight radiance unto heaven, Drinking revealments of God's paradise. Oath, menace, jeer and ribald mockeries, The vulgar's worship of all greatness, passed Like the sirocco o'er Campanian flowers Or snowpiles of the Appenines, gathering bloom And zephyr coolness, o'er his sainted soul. His lofty nature did, a moment, seem Burning in scorn upon his lips, and once, Clasping the heavy cross as't were a wand, He lifted his proud form and matchless head, And o'er the helmed lictors looked upon The mockers—and they shrunk beneath his glance Like grass beneath the samiel; yet no more, Hushing the spirit of his grandeur, he Deigned to deem earth his home, or earthly things Fit wakeners of his thought. And so he came Unto the Accursed Field, and one, all shunned, Loathing, drave down the massy cross. whereon, With lingering patience, he had stretched and nailed, Through palm and sole, the Martyr, every blow Tearing the impaled nerves, and through heart and brain Sending a sick convulsion; but the pangs Passed quickly o'er his features, though the limbs Quivered, and, as he looked to heaven, a light, Brighter than universes of bright suns, Fell round the Martyr in his agony! `A Prodigy! Jove flashes wrath! the gods Forbid the death!' shouted the multitude, Like foliage fluctuating, as the spells Of all-believing Fear fell on their hearts. `All Rome shall perish if the Christian dies!' `Hence, vassals! fools! home to your huts! away!' Rose the proud Prefect's quick, stern, ruthless voice, Whose echo was an oracle. `Ye slaves! The beast should batten on the slain, I know, And ye can taunt and torture helplessness, And dread the very shade of danger's ghost; But, by the Spectre River! Rome's best spears Shall search your dastard dust, if ye but speak Ere each adores his hearth-god! hence! away!' The Gracchi from the Aventine dragged forth 11 For senators to slaughter well displayed The liberties of Rome; and they, who held The Briton chief barbarian, shrunk away, When a patrician bade, without a voice! But bondage and brute violence are one. Then, as the steps of the vast throng retired 8 Like dying waves, the priests and guards outspread Their banquet on the plain beneath the tents— (The kalends of the seventh month had come) They bore to shield the sun, while there they watched The fever, famine, thirst and pangs of death. Pheasants, Falernian, mirth, song, jest and oath Inspired the revel 'neath the cross, and all Care and command, save that which bade them see The Martyr die, fled from their spirits now. Wanton with wine, the priest revealed to scorn His wiles and sophistries and oracles, Blessing the phantom gods that shadows held Dominion o'er the conscious fears of men. Warriors portrayed, in tales of other climes, Numidia, Arcady or Syrian realms, The splendor of the spoil, the gems and gold, The perfumes, luxuries and regal robes, Fair slaves and diamonds, wafted from the shores Of the Orient, in homage to the diadem That circled nations. Many a demon deed And dark career of crime then first to light Leapt from the dizzy brain of guilt, and moved Applause and rival histories of acts O'erpast; how dusky kings in palaces, Amid their pomp, gleaming magnificence, Did perish in the flame, and none could save The victim, though they bore his coffers forth How queens and virgin princes in their bowers, On broidered couches slumbering, while their robes, Like zodiacs, glittered in the purple light, Felt not the serpent that trailed o'er their sleep, But died in their pavilions, voicelessly! Then senators and knights, with mutual mirth, Discoursed of laws enacted or suppressed As suited Cæsar, and quenched liberties, Naming them treason; and asserted rights, They branded as seditions; and revealed To the unshuddering guards the mysteries Of Rome's proud Forum, where the agonies Of desolated kingdoms, and the shrieks Of nations in their bondage, and the tears Of eloquent affection to the lords Of power were music and unholy mirth. Then round the martyr mingled voices rose Louder, and laughter to impiety Replied, and men, the gods, truth, chastity, Love, honor, courage and fidelity, All were but mockeries to the rioters. “Hercle! is this the Lupercal? ye howl Like Conscript Fathers when the spoil is lost! Peace!” said the Prefect—“see ye not the lips Of yon hoar traitor trembling with quick thought? Listen! he speaks his last,—his heart 's too old To linger in the torture of the tree!” “The isles shall wait, Jehovah! for thy law, 12 And knowledge to and fro shall spread, till earth Utter Thy praise like voices of the sea!” Thus spake the victim, in delirium, Wrought by deep anguish, wandering yet among The dear homes of his mission. “Dangers wave Their wings around us, brethren! and the waste, Boundless and shadowless, must still be trod! Yet not by dim lights of a doubting faith Are ye led on through wrong and woe and want, For the Anointed hath not left us here Without a Comforter, and hath He not Laid up, in many mansions, crowns of joy, Where mortal doth put on immortality? Grieve not the Spirit! yet a little while, And ye shall reap the harvest and rejoice; And though, ere then, this flesh must see decay, Yet I shall mingle with your prayer and hymn, By morn and eve—and breathe the Savior's smile O'er the glad isles of Gentiles so beloved!” Then spasms of vivid pain passed o'er his face, His eyes rolled back upon the brain, and left The pale streaked orbs writhing in gloom—the lids Now folded to their lashes, coiling now In nature's deep convulsion, till the veins, O'erfraught and purple, on his cloven brow, Seemed bursting o'er the altar of his soul. His livid lips, parted by torture, breathed Deep undistinguished murmurs, then compressed Like sculptured curves and lines of thought; the limbs, Meantime, grew cold, and the dark gathering blood Forsook its own familiar temple, when The shadows of the sepulchre stole on. “Dis leaves his realm to welcome him,” said one. “Peace! thou discourteous knight! jeers skill not now; Thy mirth is motlied with mortality, And thou thyself mayst pray for Lethe ere The graceless Stygian grasps thine obolus. Put on thy knighthood! peace! he speaks again!” And the proud Prefect flung his casque to earth. In moans, like autumn gusts, the martyr spake, Hovering o'er shattered memories like the sun O'er broken billows of the shoreless sea! “Let me behold thy domes, Damascus! meet It is the arrows of Life's penitence Should pierce the persecutor.—Oh, farewell! My brother! blessed in Pisidia be Thy walk and watching!—To the Unknown God! Are ye the worshipped wisdom of all Greece, When ye disdain your thrice ten thousand gods, Adoring Doubt or Demon, knowing not The Deity revealed?—Ye can attest, I have not coveted the gold of earth, The gorgeous raiment or vain pomp of men, But ministered, in all, unto myself! Ay, driven to and fro in Adria Upon Euroclydon, no hope is left But in the Wielder of the wave and wind. Despair not! though sun, moon and stars are hid, Jehovah watches from eternity! Contend not, brethren! untaught man may win Redemption from the deep crimes of his age, And be a law unto himself; e'en Rome Hath in her years of darkest guilt had such. Oh, sorrow not like them who have no hope! The seed shall not decay though I am dust! —Why do ye scourge me, soldiers? know ye not I am a Roman? I appeal to Cæsar! —Bring me a winter robe when thou dost come Again—the night is cold among the hills, And I am very weary! so, farewell!” Then the bare nerves and sinews sent their pangs For the last time upon his fainting heart, And, as beyond the trembling battlements Of agonizing flesh, the spirit strove To flee, beholding heaven, the bitter strife O'erawed the infidel, and round the cross Stood silent pagan revellers! Once more The apostle's peerless mind gleamed out—his eyes, Living in the dark light of boyhood, flung Their dying splendors o'er the Imperial Hills, The mountains and the waters—while his pulse Intensely throbbed and paused—and the heart's chill And fever rushed to life's deep fount and spread A shuddering faintness and sick gasping sense Of falling through infinitude, o'er all The vital functions of his frame. “My God!” 'Twas but a hollow echo from the tomb, Yet it said “Jesus! let me—see—Thy face!” And Saul of Tarsus stood before his God!” “As thou shalt stand before Gaetulia's king, The Barcan lion!” cried the ruthless voice Of Diomede's outwatching messenger, The undeterred achiever of his will— Grasping the Christian while his fellows rushed Upon his pale but dreadless Hebrew bride. “Well!” said the minion, “traitors serve, sometimes, The empire's weal, and martyrdom, methinks, Hath a rare syren music, for ye stood Grandly before us in the comet light, Wrapt in your exalted Nazarene, Till we could climb the cliffs and do the hest Of the proconsul, unfulfilled too long! Come, Rabbi! thou art skilled in subterfuge, And hast not scorned the sword in better times— The games shall test thy genius—on with me! The Gladiator's banquet waits, and thou Shalt quaff the massic or the tears of Christ. 13 Veles! thou hast thy charge! the Prætor's coin Rewards not slack obedience, though his wrath Ne'er palters with a thought of treachery! The lady—Venus! but she hath a brow Like the coy Delian queen!—must be disposed, With all respect,—lead on! the daystar wanes!” “Thraso! we were not foes when, side by side, We scaled Antonia's tower, and saw the walls Of Zion crushed—Why now? thou art disguised,” Said Pansa, with the heart's best eloquence, As down the steep crags turned the lictor band, Bearing his bride. “Why from my heart, by guile Betrayed, by violence asunder rent, Tearst thou my Mariamne, mocking thus?” “And dost thou ask, apostate? hast thou not Contemned the gods, scorning thy father's faith? Forsaken the eagle banners, deeming rocks Better than camps? and sowed sedition, thick As sand-clouds, through the legions? thou hast wed A captive, too, whom, though with all thy gold Thou bought'st, poor fool! yet hast not held, as bids The law, in bondage! dost thou ask again? Mine office deigns no farther word, but more Thou soon shalt learn in bitterness! lead on!” “Bear me with her, where'er ye drag, whate'er Ye or your lords in lawlessness inflict! No more my voice shall crave or ye deny!” “The Prætor's edict suits no purposes Apostates may desire; your destinies Have separate mansions, renegade!” Along Ravine and precipice and lava bed, Vineyard, pomegranate grove and vale of bloom, The Pagan haled his victims, till the gate Of Pompeii flew wide, and Pansa saw, In speechless agony, a moment ere The Mamertine abysses 14 were his home, Pale shuddering Mariamne through the gloom Of statues, pillars, temples and hushed streets, Where fountains only witnessed deeds of death, Borne like a shadow to a nameless doom. END OF CANTO I.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE LAST NIGHT OF POMPEII. CANTO II. Vandal and violater, Time! thou art The spirit's master—the heart's mocker! thou Pourest the deluge of returnless years Over the gasping bosom, and on thought, That, in aurora streams of magic light, Flung its deep glory o'er the heavens, dost heap Clouds without flame or voice, cold, deep and dark, Which are the shroud of the mind's sepulchre! Far better not to be than thus to be! Better to wander like the gossamer, The baffled buffet of each aimless wind, Than sink like dial shadows, all but breath Leaving the wreck that trembles on the strand. And why to man, feeble in youth's best hours Of intellect and power, in all his hopes So false unto himself and his compeers, Are strength and pride and potency assigned? Why is his grandeur wedded to despair? His love to grief? his heart to hopelessness? His fame and his dominion to the dust? Yet thou, Tyrant of Air! hast chronicles Of darker import, and the world is filled With thine unpitying ministers of woe. Beneath the rush of thy dark pinions nought Lives, or life lingers, breathing at its birth The death that soon becomes an ecstacy. Wan yet not hoary, broken at the goal Of young ambition, myriads feel thy flight In torture and desire in vain to sleep. Earth's beauty, heaven's magnificence, the charms Of zephyrs, verdure, azure, light, hills, streams, And forests, castelled by eternal rocks, Beheld long, fade upon the sated soul, Exhaust by their sublimities, and shed Their fragrance, music and romance on hearts Inured and soiled—too weak to bear their bliss, Too cold to feel their glories! And we roam The paradise of all earth's pleasantries, Amid the care, toil, phrenzy, want and strife Of the protracted agonies of breath, Feeding on raptures, that, fulfilled, are woes! But o'er thy ruins, Time! and the thick clouds Of the heart's mysteries a sun shall burst, As now Apollo's steeds, caparisoned In mornbeam hues, rush up the Appenines, Star-eyed Eous and wild Phlegon first, Pouring the sungod's splendors o'er the domes Of Pompeii waking from her last still sleep. As from the violet pavilions stole The dayspring's beautiful and blessed light, Like rose-leaves floating, and the mountains bent Their awful brows in worship at the fount Of radiance, by all ages sacred held As the peculiar home of deity, Mythra or Bel or Elios—the name Erred, but the spirit brooded o'er the heavens, Up rose the vassals from their earth-beds, late On yesternight pressed by the sinking limbs And breaking hearts of bondage; no perfumes Needed the stripe-gashed body or shorn head: No lavers waited thraldom; on they flung Rude garments soiled by servitude, and turned To grind at the accursed mill, and lift Their branded brows at the stern master's voice, In silence passing o'er Mosaic floors To bear the golden bowl or myrrhine cup, Falernian or frankincense to their lords. For them no statue bowed in majesty, No consul framed a law, and none of all The common deeds of earth had interest, For they were stricken from the roll of men And banished from humanity, 15 and Rome Gazed from the temple of her trophies on The hopeless captives—from her triumph hills, Where armies shouted Liberty! upon Her myriads of bondmen, with a smile, That thanked her thrice ten thousand deities, The o'ershadowing empire of the world was Free! Waking to want from dreams of affluence, Parting from splendor to meet toil and tears, Then rose pale Indigence in shattered cells, Dusky and damp and squalid, yet o'ertaxed By the imperial rescript, to endure The taunts of mimes, the old indignities Of freedmen, merciless in novel power, The insolence of taskers and the shame Of slack dismissal with their pittance, when The proud patrician deigned to bid his slave Cast the base drachms at the plebeian's feet! Ere melted the wreathed mists from isle or mount, City or lake, while Pompeii's pinnacles Ascended in uncertain grandeur yet, The artizan went forth to build again The fabrics earthquakes had late sported with; Doomed, ere the dial rested shadowless, To cease from toil for ever!—and the sounds Of early servile labor multiplied Through glimmering arcades and noisome courts Thronged ever by the peasants pomp creates, As the sun gathered up his streaming rays, And his broad disk lanced light o'er all the earth. Late, from their holy dreams in the profound Of their proud temples, ne'er by foot profane Invaded, waked the pagan oracles, The ministers of mysteries all unrevealed, Save to the forgers of the fictions,—gazed Bewildered on the amphoræ that stood Beneath their sacred stores 16—and turned, once more, To matin visions of deluding faith, Processions and responses, gorgeous robes, Banquets, and free bequests when they alone Stood o'er the dying, and dominion bought By endless cycles of hypocrisies. All hierarchies, howsoe'er unlike In ritual, are in earthly hope the same; Pleasure, their idol, ease, their ecstacy, Power, their ambition, and the will of God, The blasphemed agency of their own lusts. The virgin dew yet on the verdure hung, When, one by one, the mourners of the lost Stole to the street of sepulchres and sat Beside the ashes of their ancestors, Watching the beams that never more would greet The perished, and, they thought not, never more Light Pompeii to her loved festivities! Few, on this mission of elysian love, Left Tyrian couches and the bliss of sense; Yet they were blessed in the seraphic gift Of feeling, which, in solitude, is heaven! Tombs were the earliest temples, the first prayers Gushings of grief, the holiest offerings, Tears of bereavement, and the loveliest hymns, Sighs over the departed; worship, then, Rose from the heart, that, mid these simple rites; Felt no delusion or vain mystery: Urns were the altars, and the incense, love. 10 The sodden pulse, offered by humble faith, Desiring not demanding, far outweighed Oblations chosen from harbaric spoils; And with a purer purpose, poverty Knelt by the wayside image of the god Than gorgeous pontiffs by Olympian shrines When sin gains sanction and the heart is soiled By unrebuked, ay, customary crime, The tenderest yearnings of the bosom—love, With its dependence and delight—its smile, Like rifted rose-leaves, and its tear, like dew Shook from the pinions of the seraphim, Breathe unaccepted music; the caress Of childhood hath no bliss—its early words And looks of marvel find no fellowship— For the evil usages of life, that dwells But in the glare and heat of midnight pomp, Corrode, anneal and desecrate all love. Yet some preserve the vivid thoughts—the charms Of household sanctities; and one such now Rose from affection's spotless couch and bent O'er the angel face of virgin infancy; And thus her gentle and blest thoughts found words. “Thou sleep'st in Love's own heaven, my child! that brow No guilt hath darkened and no sorrow trenched: Those lips, which from thy fragrant breath receive The incense hues of thy sweet heart, no gust Of uttered passion hath defiled; thy cheek Glows with elysian health and holiness: And all thy little frame seems thrilling now In the pure visions of a soul sky born. The Lares be around thee, oh, my child! For never yearned Cybele over Jove With transport deeper than is mine o'er thee!” Then o'er her babe she spread the drapery, Kissing the shut lids and unsullied brow, Where the mind dreamed, perchance, of bliss foregone, And shading with her byssus robe and flowers The sunbeams from the sleeper, with a step Soft as the antelope's, she stole and knelt In prayer for that loved one at Vesta's shrine. Breathing their bliss in melodies of love, Their pictured wings fanning the ether, flew The song birds, and the groves were full of mirth Too pure for any voice but music's, when, Lifting their dim eyes to the blaze of day, Campania's proud patricians deemed the hour So far removed from common time of rest, Without dishonor, they might breathe the breeze, That o'er the dimpled waters and the flowers, Since the first tints of dawn, had played like thought Over the face of childhood—yet bore now The vivid heat and dense effluviæ Of culminating sun and marsh exhaled. To mask the treacheries of eye and lip Is pride's philosophy, the felon's skill, The code of kings, the priesthood's mystic creed, Unknown to accolytes; and none beheld, Save the bronze lares, revel's quivering eye, And dull brow bound with iron, or the face Of matron guilt pallid with watch and waste, And trembling in the faintness of a heart Wrecked by excess of passion, yet again Gasping for midnight poison! Untrimmed lamps, Sculptured with shapes of ribaldry to lure 17 Even satiety to sin's embrace, To tempt the timid and inflame the inured, Stood round the household altar, and upon The silken couch of customary crime Shed the pale, sickly light of vice o'erworn. Oh that lascivious guilt at midnight wore The lurid look, the loathing shame of morn! Bracelets of gems, enchanted amulets, And vases wrought with wanton images, And frescoes, picturing the satyr joys Of Jove and Hermes and the Laurel God, (For the old divinities were human crimes) And fountains, with nude naiads twining round The unveiled tritons, and fair pedestals, With groups of Paphians, in the forest dim, (Where gloating forms lifted the filmy robes Of the bacchantes in voluptuous sleep,) Holding their revelries with gods disguised, And every portraiture of pleasure known To them, whose whole religion was excess,— All in the chaos of the morning, flung Alluring raptures over sated sense And sickened passion, uttering, without voice, “Ye buy Repentance at the price of hell!” Loathing the fiend they folded to their hearts, The madness and the malady of life, The languor and the listlessness, that spring From the exhaustion of a maniac lust, The masters of the throng, in marble baths And Araby's perfumes and cordial cups Sought renovation for renewed delights. Odors and thermal waters may restore The maddening fever of the flesh, but earth Hath nought to hush the muttering lips of guilt, Or quell Death's agonies which guilt inflicts. The Sybarite from Salmacis arose 18 To consummate his orgies with fresh bliss, But Lethe had no power o'er memories Of broken vows and imprecating oaths Made by the River of the Dead, what time Cocytus moaned and Phlegethon upcast Its lurid gleams o'er chasms of torrent gloom, Bidding the banished reveller, who dared To mock the Styx, roam by its blackened shores Through the dark endlessness of shame and woe! It was the Harvest Festival; the corn Of Ceres filled the garners, and the vine Of the Mirth-Maker from the winepress poured Divine Falernian; and the autumnal feast, The gathering of the fruits, to all the gods, (Through the Earth-Mother and the King of Cups) Was dedicated with a soul of joy. In every temple the proud priesthood put Their purple vestures and tiaras on For the solemnities they loved to hold, And masked the haughtiness of peerless power Beneath an austere aspect and a faith That spared no violater of their laws. Forth with the swell of trumpet and the voice Of mellow flute and cithern, came the pomp In all its grandest pageantry; the god Of light gleaming on banners wrought with forms Picturing theogenies or bridal rites, Or earthly deeds of the divinities. First walked Jove's pontiff in his diadem, His crowned and sceptred standard fleckered o'er With lightning bolts and tempest gloom, upborne By popæ, weaponed for the sacrifice. Then in the mazes of a wanton dance, Lifting the thyrsus crowned with ivy wreaths, And muttering banquet hymns, the priests of mirth With antic faces and wild steps leapt on. Next, with a golden ensign, vales and hills Along its borders, filled with flocks and herds, And tall sheaves in the centre, slowly trod The ministers of Saturn's Daughter blest. But, dimming all by splendor only known In Egypt's voiceless mysteries, above The long array now towered the gonfalon Of Isis, glowing with devices shame Shrunk to behold, the shapes of earth's worst sins—19 Deified fiends! and with the lozel's smiles, Her crowned pastophori, proud of their shame, Waved round the ribald picture as they passed The mansions of their votaries, and maids And matrons hailed it from their porticoes. Apollo from his eyes of ecstacy And lips of bloom filling the bosomed air With oracles; and Hermes, in the embrace Of Iris, winging the blue heavens of love, With his enchanted rod pointing to earth; Vesta mid her Penates welcoming; The heavenly Venus, with her starlight eyes, Veiled brow and girded cestus, looking up To the pure azure, spotless as her soul, Followed by the more worshipped Cyprian queen, So shadowed by her draperies that guilt Revelled in beauty mocked with robes to tempt; The war-god with the ancilia and the plumes 20 Of gory fight, whose triumph was despair; Proud Pallas with stern lips, and stainless brow, Surmounted by its olive wreath, and eyes That never quailed in their calm chastity; Cotytto—the earth-passion's idol—mid The unclothed Baptæ painted with designs To startle e'en sear'd sense into a blush; The sea-king with his trident; the castout And shapeless forger of the lightning bolts; The deity of Erebus with her He bore from Enna, and his son, the god Of gold; Diana, in her treble forms, Magician, huntress, virgin of the skies; Hirsute and pranksy Pan, amid his fauns; Nymphs, dryads, oreads and tritons;—all The beautiful or dread or uncouth thoughts The imagination made divinities, In gorgeous chaos, to the Pantheon Through Pompeii's streets thronged in their riot hour. Behind the glittering crowd, the hecatomb Of victims, led by golden cords, moved on. To every god the sacrifice was meet; The dove to Venus, and the bull to Mars; To Dian, the proud stag—the lawless goat, that tears the vine-leaves, to the deity Of the gay banquet; and their horns, o'erlaid With gold, tossed haughtily amid the crowd, As, rolling their undreading eyeballs round, They glared defiance and amazement, mute Yet merciless when fit occasion came. “An evil omen! lo! the victims strive, 11 And we must drag them to the altar!” 21 said The trembling augur—“what most dismal grief And fatal destiny shall follow this?” Yet onward surged the multitudes with boughs Of olive in their hands and laurel crowns, And Zeian barley spears folded in wreaths By locks from richest fleeces, as they passed The temple images, with practised skill, Bending their foreheads on expanded palms. And onward o'er the Appian Way the host Of mitred, robed and bannered priests drew nigh The fane of all the gods, and, at a word, The music softened to a solemn strain, The measured voices of the holy chiefs Ascended in a song, and, as they ceased, The people, like the ocean's myriad waves, Raised their responses to the harvest prayer. THE PÆAN OF THE PANTHEON. STROPHE. Wielder of Worlds that round Elysium dance Beneath the brightness of thy sleepless eye, Who from the bosom of the flame dost glance. And feelst our time in thine Eternity! Thou deathless Jove! Monarch of awe and Love! Look from the radiant height of thy dominion On thine adorers now, And waft thy smile on Hermes' rainbow pinion, And bend thine awful brow! Immortal and supreme! With vows and victims to thy shrine we come, And hearts that breathe the incense of their praise, And first fruits borne from each protected home, To bless thee for the blessings of our days! Have we not heard thy spirit in the dreams, That glance o'er thought like morn's young light on streams? In visions, watched thy bird of triumph near The azure realms of thine ethereal sphere, Waiting behests of victories and powers And counsels from thy throne? Hath not thy thunder voice, the summer showers, The lightning spirit all thine own, Bade strew the exulting earth with fruits and flowers? Therefore, we render up The spotless victim from the wood And household field, and from libation cup Pour the rich vine's unmingled blood. Accept our praise and prayer, Sceptred Immortal of the chainless Air! Chorus.—King of Elysium! hear, oh hear From thine Olympian scat! To priest and people bow thy sovereign ear! We dare not see thy face, but kiss thy sacred feet! ANTISTROPHE. God of the mornlight, when the orient glows With thy triumphant smile, and ether feels The Hours and Seasons, mid their clouds of rose, Swept o'er its bosom on the living wheels Of thy proud car, When through the abysses of the heaven each star Before the splendor of thy spirit fades Like insect glimmerings in the noontide glades! Hail, radiant Phœbus! lord Of love and life, of wisdom, music, mirth, At whose resistless word Being and bliss dance o'er the blossomed earth! O Pythian Victor, hear! Pæonian healer of our ills, behold! Breather of oracles! thy sons draw near To feel the music of thy lyre unfold, As shadows change before the morn to gold, The sealed-up volume of our darkened minds. Breathe on Favonian winds, And from the effluence of immortal light Strew our dim thoughts with rays, Till, sorrowing o'er this failing praise, We know, with burning hearts, to sing thy deeds aright! God of the harp and bow, Whose thoughts are sunbeam arrows, hear! Giver of flowers! dissolver of the snow! Accept our gifts and let thy sons draw near! Chorus.—Io Pæan! from thy sphere, King of prophets, hear, oh hear! From hallowed fount and hoary hill, And haunt of song and sunlight near, With inspirations come and every bosom fill! EPODE. Reveal the shrine! wave ye the laurel boughs, Dipped in the fount that purifies the heart! Unsullied Dian! breathe our holiest vows! Storm-crowned Poseidon! to the imperial mart Thou bearst the Median gems, And loftiest Asian diadems, And o'er thy billowy world we pour our praise! Uranian Venus! let the Vesper rays Of thy beatitude around us float and dwell, Till thine ethereal loveliness o'ercomes The stains and shadows of thy mocker here, And high the vine-god's song may swell Among the shrines of Vesta's hallowed home Without a following tear; And Isis' mystic rites may thrill The soul with Plato's most celestial vision, And Pallas in her grandeur fill The heart of Ceres with her mind elysian! Blesser with bounty, hail! What but thy gifts can mortals offer thee? Smile on the banquet and the song and tale The Dionysius breathes to thy divinity! Hail, all ye gods of air, earth, wave and wind! Ye oceans from the streams of human mind! With spotless garments and unsandalled feet. Purified bodies and undaring souls, We the Pantheon tread! oh, meet, Meet your adorers! lo! the incense rolls Along Corinthian columns and wrought roof, Like Manes wandering o'er the fields of bliss! Chill not our worship with a stern reproof! Hail, all ye gods! we worship with a kiss! Chorus —From shore and sea and vale and mountain, Hail ye divinities of weal or woe! Olympus, Ida, grotto, fountain,— We in your Pantheon kneel—around your altars bow! Thro' the bronze gates, sculptured with legends feigned Of the theocrasies, the pageant swept, A thousand feet dancing the song, and paused Around the shrines they dragged the victims up. Then bending from Jove's altar to the east, The Pontiff raised the golden chalice, crowned With wine unmingled, and, amid the shower 22 Of green herbs, myrrh, obelia and vine leaves Poured out the brimmed libation on the head Of the awaiting sacrifice, from flocks Chosen for beauty, and young quickening life. Then with a laurel branch, he sprinkled all, Circling the altar thrice; the heralds, then, Cried, “Who is here?” and all the multitudes Like billows answered deep, “Many and good!” “Breathe not the words of omen!” “Lo! we stand Like Harpocrates in the vestibule!” The High Priest, mid the wreathing incense, raised The prayer; the augur, with his wand, marked out The heavens; the aruspices, with eyes of awe Behind the slayers of the sacrifice Stood gazing on the victims. “Hath no spot, No arrow from the Huntress' bow or dart Of Pythius stained the offering?” said the priest. “'Tis fair and perfect, and unblemished stands To give its body to the Harvest Queen And all the gods!—We pour into its ear The holy water—yet it doth not nod! We bend the neck—it struggles for the flight! Dismal presages! omens of despair!” The Pontiff quailed, not in the dread of gods, (His sole divinity was his own power) But fear of superstition's evil thought, As from the fluctuating host arose A smothered shriek of terror; and, in tones Quick, stern, and deep as the exploded bolt, Commanded “Strike! the wrath of Jove attends The impious delay!” and, hushed as heaven When broods the hurricane on cloudy deeps, The worshippers stood trembling as they looked,— The agonies and ecstasies of fear And hope, in stormlike glimpses, shadowing o'er The broken waves of faces—on the shrine, And saw the axe of the cultrarius fall! Maddened and bleeding, yet not slain, the ram Flung back his twisted horns—sent up a sound Of anguish, and in phrenzy on the air Springing, in his fierce death throes, fell amidst Dismayed adorers and gasped out his life. Shrieks o'er the panting silence rose and filled The temple, and in horror shrunk the throng, As o'er the accursed rites pale Nemesis, Leading the Destinies, had come to blast The sacrifice with sacrilege; but now The Pontiff's voice, bidding his lictors quell The tumult, called another victim up, And stillness brooded o'er the stricken crowd. Cashing the lifted neck, the popæ held The brazen ewers beneath the bubbling blood, And white-robed flamens bade the people note The happiest augury—without a sigh Or tremor, seen or heard, the victim died. Then flayed and opened they the offering, Lifting the vitals on their weapons' points. With writhing brows, pale lips and ashen cheeks, And failing hearts, in horror's panic voice, The aruspices proclaimed the prodigies. “The entrails palpitate—the liver's lobes Are withered, and the heart hath shrivelled up!” 12 Groans rose from living surges round; yet loud The High Priest uttered—“Lay them on the fire!” 'Twas done; and wine and oil poured amply o'er, And still the sacrificer wildly cried— “Woe unto all! the wandering fires hiss up Through the black vapors—lapping o'er the flesh They burn not, but abandon! ashes fill The temple, whirled upon the wind that waves The flame through smothering clouds, towards the Mount, That, since first light, hath hurled its lava forth! Hark! the wild thunder bursts upon the right! Ravens and vultures past us on the left! Fly, votaries! from the wrath of heaven, oh fly! The Vestals shriek, the sacred fire is dead! The gods deny our prayers! fly to your homes!” From the Pantheon struggled the vast throng, And rushed dismayed unto their household hearths, While from Vesuvius swelled a pyramid Of smoke streaked o'er with gory flame, and sounds, Like voices howling curses deep in earth, From its abysses rose, and ashes fell Through the thick panting air in burning clouds. All save the haughty Pontiff, mocking fear, Had flown the gorgeous Pantheon, but he sate On the high altar, mid the trophied pomp Of priceless consecrations to the gods, Breathing his scorn and imprecations on The dastard people and the blasted rites, When, heaving as on billows, while a moan Passed o'er the statues, the proud temple swayed As 'twere an evening cloud, from side to side, Rocking beneath the earthquake that convulsed Sea, shore and mountain, at its hollow voice, Hurled into ruin; and his lips yet glowed With execrations on the sacrifice, When from its pedestal, bending with brow Of vengeance and fixed lips that almost spake, Jove's giant image fell and crushed to earth The Thunderer's mocker in his temple home! Like an earth-shadowing cypress, o'er the skies Lifting its labyrinth of leaves, the boughs Of molten brass, the giant trunk of flame, The breath of the volcano's Titan heart Hung in the heavens; and every maddened pulse Of the vast mountain's earthquake bosom hurled Its vengeance on the earth that gasped beneath. Yet mortals, then, as now, deemed deities The essence of men's passions—swayed like leaves, By orison or chanted hymn, from deeds, Ere time had birth, appointed. So, within Their secret chambers and the silent groves, While Ruin's eye from the red living bolt Glanced with a glare of scorn upon their rites, The doomed idolaters, abashed yet fain To win redemption from suspended wrath, Round their Penates cowered, while magians came, Sybils and sorcerers, to mock the mind With mystic divinations, and reveal, What prophets need not show, folly and guilt. To avert the threated vengeance, Egypt's spells, Muttered in sounds the utterer made not speech, By magic incantations wrought, called up Earth demons to unfold the future's deeds. THE SYBIL'S INVOCATION. From the hill forest's gloom, Where the lemures dwell; From the depth of the tomb, Whence the soul parts to hell; From the dim caves of death Where the coil'd serpent sleeps not, And the lone deadly heath Where the night spirit weeps not; From the shore where the wreck lies, And the surge o'er the dead; From the heart of the dark skies, Where the tempest is bred; Ye Demigods, hear! Ye pale shadows, ascend! And ye demons, appear! To drink the bann'd cup ere the weird rites shall end! From the ocean deeps come, Where the coral groves glimmer, In your trailed robes of gloom, Making terror's face dimmer; From the crag-pass of slaughter, On the voiced air of death, Come, shed o'er your daughter Your oracle breath! On the night vapor stealing From the marsh o'er the mountain; On the bland air revealing No doom by the fountain; Ye Demigods, come! Ye pale shadows, ascend! And ye demons, from gloom! To drink the bann'd cup ere the weird rites shall end! Be ye blest or accursed, Be ye famished or sated, In pale Orcus the worst, In Elysium the fated; If ye roam by the shore Which ye never may leave, Or in nectar adore Where ye never can grieve; Be ye gross and malign Or elysian as air— Come forth and divine What the future may bear! Ye Demigods, come! Ye pale shadows ascend! And ye demons from gloom! To drink the bann'd cup ere the weird rites shall end! Amid the darkened necromantic haunts Of worse fiends than the evoked, no voice replied. Then, moulding effigies to suit her hate, And dropping venom in each pictured pore, The Sybil, with dishevelled serpent locks, And Lamian features, bade the fiend of fire Open the ritual of hell, and read Revealings of the Destinies—and then, She drank from the bann'd skullcup poison draughts, Pledging the damned! yet silence looked reply. And each Promethean divination brought 23 Nor shadow nor response; the mirrored glass Returned no image; the drowned ring sent up No echo; whirling gusts effaced the forms Of letters writ in ashes; magic gems No longer kept their power; the daphne burned Without a sound; and every poison herb, Though with unearthly skill distilled, no more, Like Nessus' robe and wild Medea's gift, Dispersed the agonies of maniac deaths. Restless in doubt, the human mind hath sought Knowledge in every hour of time, through tears, Wasting and want and haggard solitude, Anguish and madness; hovering o'er the verge Of the cternal ocean, from whose depths Earth's ghastly spectres rise to mock at hope, The spirit follows through forbidden paths The meteor of its own vain thought, till death Shrouds, palls and sepulchres the throbbing dust. Vain were petitions murmured to the gods Priapus and Cunina to dissolve The spells of Fascinators; the evil eye Of the Illyrian or Triballi sent Its wonted glance into the trembling breast, Possessing, as they feigned, the soul with fiends. Vainly, they wore baccharis wreaths—in vain, Their jasper, rhamn or laurel amulets On brow or bosom hung! the magi dreamed. Scorned thus by demon and by deity, In guilt's delirium to Isis' shrine, The multitude, beneath thick canopies, As dreading the last hope of their despair, Bear Pompeii's loveliest virgin 24—in the bud And perfume of her sinless being doomed To perish in the vault of mysteries, That evil men, by shedding guiltless blood, May startle Fate to speak their doom! alas! Must Death, from his pale realms of fear, so soon Breathe on that beautiful and radiant brow And leave it blasted? on the blossomed lips, Whence music gushed in streams of rainbow thought, And chill them into breathlessness and gloom? That vermil cheek—those eyes, where thoughts repose, Like clustered stars on the blue autumn skies, That head of beauty and that heart of love— Oh, must they languish, moulder, and depart, Without a sigh, from the sweet earth they loved? When has the bigot, whatsoe'er his crown,25 Cidaris, mitre, oak or laurel wreath, Spared, having power to torture? when, the slave Of superstition slackened in his zeal Of loving God by loathing humankind? Weep with the crocodile—embrace the asp— Doubt not the avalanche of ages—meet The famished wolf's sardonic smile—and sleep Beneath the upas—but believe not, man E'er yet had mercy when his guilt feared hell! With hurried footfalls o'er the lava walks 26 And through the Forum's colonnades, unmarked But by quick glances, to the Mount of Flame Turning again, the worshippers passed on, And the proud temple gates behind them closed. Then from the altar of the idol came The crowned hierophant, in robes o'erwrought With mystic symbols, emblems of a power Invisible, yet everywhere supreme, As the air that shrouds the glaciers, and, like that, Waked to annihilate, by one low voice. Lifting his dusky hand, gleaming with gems, 13 He waved the throng to worship, with hushed lips, And, with a gesture, bidding neophytes Come forth, and raise the victim, bound and stretched On the Mosaic floor, in horror's arms, With a hyæna step, through pillar'd aisles, Dim, still and awful, to the vaulted crypt Of gloom and most unhallowed sacrifice He led the bearers of the victim maid. One shuddering farewell—one shriek, that gave A legion echoes, from her muffled lips Gushed! then in gloom her hyacinthine hair Vanished—and from the veiled recesses rose The music of the sistrum, 27 and strange gleams Of violet and crimson lights along The shrine and statues flitted momently And faded; and mysterious phantoms glanced O'er the far skirting corridors, and left The awed mind wildered with a doubting sense Of silence broken by what was not sound, Nor breathings of a living heart—nor tones Of forest leaves nor lapses of the wind— But a dread haunting of a sightless fear Of unformed peril—a crushed thought, that through The twilight dimness of the fane o'erhung Gigantic beings of diluvian realms, Voiceless and viewless, yet endowed with might To rend the mortal breather of a sigh! Down the chill, dusky granite steps the priest Guided the virgin sacrifice; above, The massy and barr'd vault door shut; and night, Shown in its ghastly terrors by wild rays Of many tinctured lights, fell on the heart Of the devoted, desolated maid. Through still descending labyrinths, where coiled All loathsome creatures, and dark waters dripped With a deep sullen sound like pulses heard By captives dying in their dungeon tomb, The Egyptian glided hurriedly and still. Then o'er a green lagoon, whose festered flood Flung back a deathsome glare as the lights sunk Upon its sleeping surface stretching far Into the floating masses of the gloom, They, in a mouldered barque, went silently. The plated crocodile, on the earth and pool Suspended, ope'd his sluggish jaws and looked Upon the priest with fawning earnestness; He gazed upon the victim and passed by, And the loathed reptile dreamed of coming feasts. Rugged and spiral grew the pathway; bats, Waving the spectre lights, winged through the vaults, Startled yet welcoming; and serpents lanced Their quivering tongues of venom forth and hissed Their salutations; and the lizards crept Along the cold, wet ridges of the caves; And oft the maiden's agonizing eyes Beheld in niches or sarcophagi Mortality's abhorred resemblances, With folded serpents sculptured overhead; And oft the feet of the familiars struck Strewn relics of the victims offered here! Winding through tangled passages—her brain O'erfraught with the still horror—for no sound Lived through the endless caverns—thought and sense Of being fled from the doomed maiden's heart, Time, mystery and darkness and lone death Passed from the trances of her brain, and earth And agony and wrong and violence Were but the shadows childhood sports withal! She woke amid the gush and hymning voice Of fountains and the living gleam of fires, And swell of tenderest music; and beside The purple couch of luxury, whereon, Free from all bonds save chains of jewelled gold, In a vast chamber, hung with flowers and gems, She lay, the priest of Isis stood;—his eye No longer stern and chill, his lips no more Like sculptured cruelty, but bright and warm And moist with mellowest wine; and o'er his face, Late masked in mockeries, the burning light Of Passion broke, as thus, with wanton smiles, He breathed his heart upon his victim's ear. “Thy path to pleasure, like the world's, my love! Was through the empire of pale doubt and pain, Where many visions of detested things Will consummate in rapture deigned thee here. And didst thou think, my queen of loveliness! That by the dastard crowd of Pompeii Thou wert borne hither that the sacred lips Of Isis, parted by thy purest blood, Might give responses to fiend-loving fools? The goddess hath a voice—when I ordain, And, when her mysteries have filled their hearts With myriad terrors to which death is bliss, They shall not lack an answer to their quest. But this is Love's elysium; men may seek Another by Jove's grace—but this for me! Be their's eternities of prayer and hymn! But Time and wine and Venus are my gods!” “Holy Diana! hath thine Iris 28 come To lead me through elysium's myrtle groves? Thanks for the briefest pangs of death! my soul Blends with the radiance, songs and incense here In rapture, unforgetting earth's dark ills, The victim bonds, gloom, terror, madness borne Amid the vaulted corridors—deep thanks, Chaste Dian! for the dart that winged me here!” Thus she lay whispering faintly while the veins Again like violets began to glow And Thought from the elysian portals turned To shed, once more, its starlight o'er her brow. The lips, like rifted sunset clouds, burned o'er With beauty, and the sloe-dark eyes, from lids Of loveliness o'erarched like rainbows, flashed Upon the luxuries of wantonness With a delirious brightness; and she pressed Her Peri hand upon her troubled brain As dismal memories through all the pomp Around her thronged. “Do visions o'er me rush Through the ivory gate? or what is this? methinks The limbs of Vesta pass not Charon's ward— Yet bear I them! and I behold no forms Like the supreme divinities who dwell Beyond the azure curtains of the skies!” “Look on thy suppliant worshipper, my love! Thy Saturn, my Osiris, aptly feigned, With Horus and the laughing boy-god, wreathed With lotus and charm'd myrtle, must be now The only Guardians of our paradise— For thou art the voluptuous Paphian Queen, And must with kisses be adored! thy breath Is odor—on that fair full bosom sleep A thousand loves—those lustrous eyes enchant— And the limbs moulded by divinest skill”— “Reveal thy speech! what import bear these words? Dream I, or art thou the hierophant Of Isis, who from Mizraim's pyramids Broughtst new gods into Latium? I must err, For thou wearst not the countenance that chilled My soul, and tyrannized o'er Pompeii's crowd, But rather, like earth's faun or satyr fiend, Gloatest o'er some revenge for sin unknown!” The maiden's lost mind came in all its strength And purity, and in the dreadless might Of thoughts unsoiled by evil, she resolved To match unfriended virtue with the power Of Passion in religion's mask beyond The Law's arraignment or the avenger's wrath. “Simple as Pyrrha when the shattered barque Of hoar Deucalion landed from the foam!” With blandishments, said Isis' haughty priest. “Knowst thou not, loveliest! that holy men Must never shame their gods by deeds unlike Their sacred exploits? what were deathlessness Without delight? eternity, without The ecstasies of woman's winning smile? Thy country's hoarest fathers, most for skill In council, and unequalled virtue famed, In canon and enactment of old law, Did consecrate corruption and commit Captives to bondage of their tyrant's will, And build proud temples for the haunt of shame Being but mimes of the Immortals, then, As countless births, revered as prodigies, And chained Prometheus, shunning their gift, To meet their wrath, and mad Lycaon driven Into the wild, can testify in tears. Why, then, should the weak waiter on the rites Of the Omnipotents refrain from joy? Folly must feel his masterdom, when words, Called oracles, are bought, but, in all else, The priest was framed for pleasure—and thy smile, Hebe of Beauty! from thy vassal here Shall win a better augury than all Campania's hecatombs!—time wastes, my bliss! Speak thou the oracle I shall repeat Through Isis' marble lips! the answer's thine!” “Thus be the answer, then, “Ye seek my shrine To know the Future and the will of heaven— The Past reveals both!” or, if this suit not The goddess who doth fold her tissued words So Passion may unravel good or ill, Thus let the mystic oracle declare: “Ye shall pass o'er the Tyrrhene sea in ships Laden with virgins, gems and gods, and spoils Of a dismembered empire, and a cloud Of light shall radiate your ocean path!” Breathes not the soul of mystery in this? 29 “Ay, love! and after his desire or hope Each may interpret—veriest oracles Must have a myriad meanings—and the voice Of Memphian Isis shall, at once, respond To the denied apostates; then, my life! While dotards live on riddles and embrace Shadows as did the Thunderer what time The ox-eyed empress jealoused of his deeds. 14 We at Love's heavenly banquet shall repose And drink the ecstacies of mingled hearts! --The sistrum sounds! the sculptured lips shall speak!” Exulting thus, the idol minister, Pressing the bosom of great Serapis, Whose statue by a Doric pillar stood, Disclosed a stairway guiding through the shaft Unto the altar of the fane, and thence Within the hollow image, from whose mouth Responses breathed that fitted any deed Or æra; fable was religion's name. Up through the open bosom of the God, Saying, 30 “The mocker Momus has his jest And more, since e'en the Immortal's breast bears now A mirror”—passed the priest--and soundlessly The dædal portal, bossed with vine-wreaths, closed. That moment, from the flowered and purple couch The maiden sprung, through any caverned path,— All peril and loathed sights and awful sounds, To fly from pomp, pollution and despair. Bounding along the tesselated floor, She passed the beds of banquet, whose perfume From sightless vases stole, and gained the verge Of the vast gleaming hall—she met the waves Of black and silent depths that seemed to scowl On her vain flight! to every side she flew But to encounter granite battlements, Coiled serpents, clustered sepulchres, cold cliffs, Gigantic sphynxes, towering grim o'er lakes Of sulphur, or the dreadful shapes of fiends. The gorgeous lights grew shadowy, and stained clouds Of vapor floated o'er the pillared roof, Taking all forms of terror; and low sighs And muttered dirges from the waters stole Along the arches; and through all the vaults, Into a thousand wailing echoes rent, A shriek, loud, quick and full of agonies, Burst from the deep foundations of the fane. With steps like earliest childhood's, to her couch The maiden faltered back, and there, with soul Too overfraught for wished unconsciousness, Gasping her breath, she listened! Sullen sounds Wandered along the temple aisles above; Then came the clang of cymbals and strange words Uttered amid the far-off music's swell: And the prostrated multitudes, like woods Hung with the leaves of autumn, stirred; then fell A silence when the heart was heard—a pause— When ardent hope became an agony; And parted lips and panting pulses—eyes Wild with their watchings, brows with beaded dews Of expectation chilled and fevered—all The shaken and half lifted frame—declared The moment of the oracle had come! A sceptre to the hand of Isis leapt And waved; and then the deep voice of the priest Uttered the maiden's answer, and the fall Of many quickened steps like whispers pass'd Along the columned aisles and vestibule. None deemed, the maiden in the earthquake's groan And the volcano's thunder voice had heard The hastening doom, and clothed it in dark words, The blinded victims never could discern; But to the bosom of their guilt again They passed, dreaming of victories and spoils! “Gone!” said the priest, descending—“Serapis! Pardon and thanks I crave and give thee, God! —Gone to their phantom banquet with glad hearts— Such is the bliss of superstition's creed! And they will glory o'er their fellows now, Deeming themselves the temples of the gods! Brimmed with revealings of divinity! But Folly wafts us food, and we should laud The victim of night visionries who parts With virgin gold for fabled miracles! But that thy loveliness might peril prayers And change the rites to riots ill esteemed, Thou shouldst have been a pythoness, my love! What shadow veils thy vestal brow? thou art My bride, and pleasure waits upon thee here— Let the pure wine awake thy thoughts to mirth!” “Mirth at the altar which thou mockst with jeers! Mirth in thy holy ministries, proud priest! It fits thee not—and less thine evil speech To Lælius' child, who, while her father waits On royal Titus in imperial Rome, Betrayed, it seems, by thy fit parasites, Was hither borne by Pompeii's maddened throng, Whom thy vile minions goaded to the deed, A victim, not to Isis, but to thee! Beware, thou atheist pontiff! the shocked world Hath had and shall, through uncreated time, Have mitred scorners, who blaspheme the heavens, Mocking the faith with which they manacle The hearts that would deny yet dare not—like Thee, mocker of the idol thou dost serve! Yet doubt not—years are but the viewless path Of the avenging Deity! the earth, Elysium, Orcus, the sweet pleiades, The weeping stars, the depths of ocean swept By typhon tossing billows to the heavens— All live but in the breath of one Supreme, Whose heart inspires the universe—whose soul Is Immortality! and 'neath His throne I kneel and wrap around my mortal fears The robe of His immortal purity, Bidding thee, Priest! e'en in thy purple home, Tremble amid thy thoughts of sacrilege!” “Io Athena! Pallas hath no gift To rival thine, my loveliest! thy words, Like pungent herbs before the banquet, give A charm, a flavor, an Apician zest To the deferred delight that dawns in tears. Coy maidenhood! the sage in all his lore Must learn the science of awaking bliss From thee, supremely skilled in scorpion taunt And torture, which prelude long lingering bliss. But the wine blushes, Love! to meet thy lip— Lo! how it kisses the crowned cup and smiles! Thou wouldst not leave me—though thy free discourse Argues but ill—for yon dim vaults, greened o'er A glad sound on mine ear—a triumph sound— The deep earth-hymn of ruin! hark! it swirls Along the abysses of the hills and seas, Lifting the mountains with its breath—it comes! Ye manes of mine ancestors! it comes!” “What, scorner! dost thou think to cheat my skill With thy Trophonian dreams, when I have clasped Delusions to my bosom since my birth? And juggled faith by all circean arts? I woo no longer! thou art in my grasp— And by the Immortals I contemn! thou shalt”— “It comes! the temple reels and crashes—Jove! I thank thee! Vesta! let me sleep with thee!” And on the bosom of the earthquake rocked The statues and the pillars, and her brain Whirled with the earth's convulsions, as the maid Fell by a trembling image and upraised A prayer of gratitude; while through the vaults, In fear and ghastly horror, fled the priest, Breathing quick curses mid his warning cries For succor; and the obscene birds their wings Flapped o'er his pallid face, and reptiles twined In folds of knotted venom round his feet. 15 Through the felt darkness of the labyrinth. On sculptured capitals and heads of gods She passed the dismal waves, and trident tongues Hissed after her amid the turbid foam. She passed the beamless corridors and fled Along a gorgeous banquet hall, o'erstrewn With porphyry tables, alabaster lamps, Half quenched, and shattered wine cups of gemm'd gold. She grasped a flickering altar-light and on Hurried, casting on dolesome objects round, And nameless things of horror, glances wild With terror and deep loathing; the death-dews Upon the walls, green with the deadly moss, Trailed in thick streams, and o'er her sinking heart Breathed the cold midnight of the sepulchre; And from the shapeless shadows growing up, The startled spirit wrought the forms of fiends, Or, worse, pursuers charged to hale her back. The virgin flies along a corridor Ampler, and living with the daylight air; And far, upon its boundary, she discerns An open portal, and a rosebeam gush Of radiance streams upon the threshold stone. Like Delphi's Pythia in her maniac mood, And one with woman's weakness; as she gazed, The vanished blood, grief, shame and failing power Had driven to the fainting heart, came back, And, with a quick renewal of lost hope, Casting the other, who with palsied thought Gazed on the fearful visitor, aside, The feebler being rushed along the aisles, With ashen face and raiment soiled and torn. The maiden traced the fugitive, and ere The blood, now at the heart, might reach the brow, They stood together 'neath the open skies. “The Savior for thy service bless thee, maid!” 'Twas Mariamne—from the loathed embrace Of Diomede escaped—that quickly spake. “I cannot ask nor answer now—but fly With me, for peril's look proclaims thee pure! Quick, maiden! Diomede will never spare— Yet Mariamne once again is free! It should be noontide; but a livid gloom Palls all things, and a ghastliness, nor beam Nor blackness, wraps our flight and bodes an eve The workers of all evil, in their pride, Nor dread nor dream of! Pansa! heaven in love Keep thy unflatering thoughts beneath the wings Of cherubim, and clothe thy heart with strength To foil the fiend that dares or tempts to sin— Where'er thou art!—we shall not fail to meet, For all shall be abroad, and earth and skies And waters shall commingle ere sun sinks. Away! sweet maiden!—now the Cyprian's fane— The equestrian Forum—the Prætorians' tower— Are passed; and mid the crowded huts, that lie Beneath the amphitheatre, we rest Till the deep justice of Jehovah comes!” “Art thou a Heretic?” the maiden said. “I was a Hebrew and a princess—now I am a Christian and a captive! come— This garb and guise of thine declare, methinks, Some mysteries of thy country's deities— This day, thou shalt not fail to learn of mine!” She breathed a strange word and a shrivelled hand Unbarred a low dark postern, and a face, Darkened and harrowed by the toils and thoughts And changes of exceeding years, looked forth. The melancholy shadow of a smile And the sad echo of a broken voice Gave welcome to the wanderers; and amid The solemn stillness of their refuge fell From the pale lips of persecuted faith Full many a history of the martyrdoms. The games of life go on! Madness and mirth, Triumph and tears, the holydays of youth, The apathy of stricken age, the pride Of intellect and prostrated purposes, Rapture and anguish, poverty and pomp, And glory and the tomb—like rivals, crowd Along the isthmus of our being, doomed To vanish momently in billowy gloom! The dewlight of the morn in storm departs; The moonbeams strewing rifted clouds, like smiles Breathed from the bosom of Divinity, Sink ere the daybeam in the tempest's rack; Yet on o'er buried centuries—the dead dust Of ages—once like the starred heavens inspired By myriad passions, dreaming miracles, And winged conceptions infinite as air— Time, the triumpher, in his trophied car, Moves sternly, trampling ardent hearts to earth. Oh, diademed Hypocrisies! budding Bliss, The mildew sears—sky-soaring Hope, that dies In its birth moment—Love, which on its shrine Of incense perishes—and Fame, that drinks The bane of human breath and falls alone! The same arena, judges, wrestlers, crown— The same brief transport and unsolaced doom— First, madness, and then vanity—the world Must be, till time is quenched, what it hath been, The bounded circle of chained thought, trod down By nations hastening into nothingness, Echoing the groans of Pain's ten thousand years, And drenched by tears that find no comforter! With livid clouds of ashes, lava hail, And furnace cinders all the air was filled; And through the bosom of Vesuvius passed Groans as of earth-gods in their endless death, And giant writhings, crushing the earth's heart; And through the tossing vapors, mingling flame And cavern gloom, toward the Evening Isles So loved by ancient sage and patriot bard, From the passed zenith rolled the gory sun. Like the ailanthus tree of old Cathay, Whose boughs, hoar legends say, bloom in the stars, The deep smoke of o'erhanging ruin whirled From the volcano's pinnacle, and flung Its branches over nations, scattering death. The Appenines, looking the wild wrath and awe Their woods and precipices took, upraised Their brows of terror and magnificence, On their eternal thrones watching the throes Of the convulsed abysses; from the crags The seared and shivering forests bent and moaned, As o'er them flew the torrid blast of fate; And, as the molten rocks and mines began To pour their broad deep masses from the height, Vast trunks of cypress and of cedar stood Charred, stark and trembling, and the castelled cliffs Burst like a myriad thunders, while the flood Of desolation, o'er their crashing wrecks, Tow'rd Herculaneum, gleaming horror, rolled. Yet men repented not of foregone crime, Denied them not their wonted festivals, Their pomp of garniture and banquet mirth. Tornado, pestilence, earthquake and war, Awe not the criminal inured to guilt; So the barbed poison arrow flies his heart, His pageants and night orgies brighter glow— Though death sighs float along the wine cups brimmed With nectar mocking all calamities. From the Basilicæ the Prætor passed, (Thither, when foiled in lust, to wreak his wrath On guiltlessness and guilt alike, he went) Leaving his tyrant judgments, in a voice Of jeering merriment pronounced, to fall On less offending breakers of the law. Prostrate upon his path, a mother cried, “Spare, O Proconsul! spare my guiltless child! He walked not with conspirators—spake not To leaders of sedition—spare him, judge! He hath no father—and is all to me!” “The hordes of Hæmus may learn wisdom, then, And virtue and refinement from his speech— For he is banished—I reverse no doom!” The lictors' fasces o'er the supplicant In haughty scorn went on. Another voice Assailed the Prætor: “To a cruel lord The quæstor sold my husband for the tax Ye laid upon our thatched hut—and he groans In bondage, while his famished children die!” “Why am I thus benetted on my way? I serve the senate and inflict their laws. What is't to me who thralls or suffers thrall? Let him atone! Why should he scorn to toil?' 16 “Justice, Lord Governor!” a third implored. “Thy favorite Vibius hath cast deep shame Upon my household and my daughter's wrongs Exact redress; not more than this from Rome Banished the Tarquins and decemviri!” “Ha! dost thou threat, Plebeian? Vibius hears Thy fierce arraignment with a smile—no doubt, Some twilight kisses in the summer glade— Pressed palms—clasped bosoms—dewy lips—no more! And thou wouldst mock the majesty of law, And wed thy base condition with the blood Of my Patrician friend! away with thee! Methinks, Vesuvian fume hath filled the brains Of all the city—and the boiling earth Bubbled its yeast into your grovelling hearts. On, Lictors! on—we tarry from the feast!” In robes of white, festooned by mingled flowers, And ivy wreaths or crowns of amethyst, The Prætor's guests, on crimson couches, lay Around the ivory tables, on which stood A silver shrine and images of gods. Pictures—the prodigies of perfect skill— Hung round the hall of banquet, and to men. The imitators of divinities, Made venial every vice. In plenitude Of power and treachery, their holiest Jove, Masked to dishonor and betray, achieved Shame's triumphs, and the wanton canvass lived With Mycon's impure thought 31; there Bacchus stood, Gloating o'er lozelries and revel routs, As Zeuxis drew the king of catamites; Venus, the earth-born, mid voluptuous nymphs, Reclined on myrtle beds with swimming eyes, And sunbeam lips with morn dews moist, and swell Of bosom far too beautiful, and limbs Wantoning mid flowers, that veiled them not! and fame For matchless charm of genius here had shrined Parrhasius' name! and Passion's maddening heart Burned o'er the walls, and rival statues stood Beneath; and there the last wild feast was held That e'er was bought by Pompeii's toil and tears. The kneeling slaves in goblets wrought from gems Served acrid wine—on gold plate, bitter herbs To zest the appetite; and, glancing up His haughty eyes, burning with hate and scorn, Chafed Diomede upon his vassals flung The venom of his darkly brooding mind. “Be thy locks shorn as fits thine office, slave! Or I may brand the theta on thy brow 32 Less undefined, and make the dust thy food! Campanian servitude, methinks, outgrows All wantonness;—and, Midas! thou art skilled, I hear in tintinnaculating verse, And lispest snatches of philosophy! Be master of thy safety! I may lose A pampered slave ere long—or, at the best, The tintinnaculus may shame thy clink! 33 —Be merry, friends!—what tidings from the throne? Ye have beheld the Temple of the Peace Filled with the spoils of rebel Jews, where all Treasure their gold and gems—a trophied fane! The gorgeous fabric is a coffer! Rome, The mistress of earth's glories and delights, Hath few rings now e'en on patrician hands. What think ye, then? a sackcloth skeleton Wanders and mutters on the Palatine That what he calls Jehovah's wrath will burst, And in thick blackness bury all this pomp,— Making Earth's Mistress a stark mendicant!” Loud laughed the parasites, and wanton gibes Were cast on Jew and Gentile; then the feast Of rarest luxuries before them glowed, And, (bright libations poured to Vesta first) The beaded wine was quaffed from goblets brimm'd. “Oh, I forget!” said Diomede, the light Of the delirious revel in his eyes, As in the opal radiance of the cup They glowed, and glanced, with an exulting pride, Midst costliest viands from the mead and main— “The fairest sport awaits us ere the games! In the Campanian legion at the siege Of that black Golgotha the traitors called Jerusalem, a soldier served with skill Whom Titus made decurion: him the plague Of the new Heresy and Love, at once, Infected; and, abandoning the host, He sought elysium in the caverns here, Till Thraso found his philosophic haunt, Where with his Hebrew Paphian he was wont In hermit guise to play the liberal. He dies to-day; but for the present mirth His tongue may vibrate.—Ho!—The Nazarene!” The slaves led Pansa from the portico Fettered yet fearless, for the time of dread Had passed from him, and in his hopeless cell The Paraclete had shadowed o'er his soul And panoplied his heart to dare his doom. Thus, as he entered, loud the Prætor spake. “Hail, Gladiator! did thy felon god, Thy scourged and crucified divinity Instruct thee in the sabre's use against The shaggy monarch of Numidian hills? Art thou argute and apt to lunge and fence, Adroit and firm of nerve to meet or shun The tusked embrace of the heroic king? Lucania and Calabria have poured out Their thousands to behold thy feats to-day; And, gay as bridal banquetters, they throng The arcades and the vomitories now To weep the Mauretanian's martyrdom— For thou, no doubt, wilt triumph and receive The twice ten thousand acclamations sent To honor thy proud valor, as is meet. Oh, thou shalt be anointed like thy Christ, And not with vulgar nard by courtesans, But ceroma and myron! owest thou not Thanks to the Roman mercy for this care?” “A Roman's Mercy! every spot of earth Your banners have shed plagues on, can attest With shrieks what mercy Rome has given earth. Yet ye shall never feel the love ye boast Until the slaves ye trample, rack and slay, After the unanswered vengeance of your will, Shall learn that they are human and awake To imitate the mercy of their lords! Perchance—'twas in thy native land—I know Thee and thy fathers, Prætor! though thou sitst In pride of judgment now—thine ancestors Were suttlers of the Carthagenian camp, When mine called freedom to the sacred Mount; Thou mayst have heard the tale of Sicily, Or read that Spartacus withstood the hosts—” “Ay, traitor and apostate! ere an hour To gnash thy perjured tongue!” said Diomede, Dreading his victim's speech, for he had lived In terror of the knowledge of his birth, Yet foaming curses. “Ay, a million died “In fit atonement of their rebel crime?” “Crime? that the name of Liberty should be The burning heart's perpetuated curse! Oh, what can thrive in thraldom but revenge? The thong, the goad, the brand of shame—the sense Of ignominy, dreading to uplift Its startled eye—what should they bring? and what Must be the fruits of such a poison tree? Condition is but chance, and none are born With manacles upon their limbs! most crimes Corrupted power makes such, and men submit Because their vital veins have wrapt the chain.” “Now by the sceptred Three who rule the shades! Can his own heretics arraign his doom? Such uttered doctrines would convulse the world, And even here shall not be spoken—cease! Thou cursed Christian! wouldst thou rouse my slaves?” “No realm of earth is slavery's—I would bid The dust be spirit, and the brute be man! I came not hither by my will—I am Thy victim, not thy vassal—and if Truth Offends, command thy serfs to bear me hence! But here—and in the arena—thought and speech Are mine; and from my country and my faith I have not failed to learn the rights of man! From the far hour when vestal Ilia sinned And suffered, and Rome's walls were laid in blood, Have human hearts had peace, whether among Helvetian icehills or the Lybian wastes? Conquest was born of carnage and the spoil Of kingdoms to a hydra faction given, While sybilline revealments—Numa's thoughts— With old religion sanctified the deeds Of desolaters of the shuddering earth. Scarce e'en for hours through all Rome's centuries Hath the caduceus met the eye of day, 34 Or the ancilia idle in the fane Of the fiend-god, whose herald is despair, Hung: but far gleaming in the torrid sun Mid standards floating to the winds of heaven, On all the earth have cast the plagues of hell. Boundless, perpetual and almighty Fear Hath ever been your God of gods—rocks, caves, Woods, grottoes, lakes and mountains are the realms Of Dis of Jupiter's elysian fields. And wisely named the sophist and the bard The floods of fabled Erebus—for Rome Baptized her sons in Phlegethons of blood, Cheering war vigils with Cocyti songs. Yon, by the Tyrrhene waters, on whose shores The banished Scipio died in solitude; The tyrant raised his hundred banquet halls, 35 Tritoli's stews and Baiæ's palaces; The cannibal patrician daily slew Captives to feed the lampreys of his lake—: 17 And Rome's all-daring Orator, proscribed By princely friendship in his peril, 'neath Antony's vengeance fell, a martyr—; there, The astute creators of your creed have feigned Your mortal hell and heaven—in Comæ's caves,— (Where dwelt Deiphobe, as in the wilds That skirt the Erythraean, tasking faith, Heirophila abode and muttered spells—) And Puteoli's naptha mines—amid The beautiful Pausylipo, whose waves And woods in sweet airs and fair suns rejoice; And maniac yells of gorgon sybils are Elysium oracles, and Zephyr's voice The music of the blest; and loftiest minds Worship in show impostures they disdain, The phantoms of the fashion, that their spoil May be the richest booty.—What reck they, The masters of men's minds, who guides the spheres? A myriad gods or none to them are one, For all are nothing but fear's phantasies. Sinnis or Sciron less obeyed earth's laws Than they the edicts of almighty Jove. The proud Alóides taught the souls of such— They would quench heaven to win the fame of earth. The all-believing, as their priests ordain, Adore their fiend god through his daughter.—Sin. Ye know not Truth in fealty or faith— And seas of lustral waters could not cleanse Your tear stained and blood sprinkled robes of guilt!” “By Hercules, the earth-cleaver! thy bold speech, Decurion once and devil caster now! Forebodes disaster to my king of beasts!” Said Diomede, beneath a mocking scorn Veiling the wrath he could not quell nor speak. “Am I the patron of thy sole renown? And doth thy creed teach viper thanklessness? I do immortalize thy robber skill Learned in meet skirmishes with vulture flocks And hordes of wolves to win the dead man's gold, And in Apollo's image to the knights Of Latium and Apulia thee present. Thou art a lion-darer, and needst not The famed Lanista's discipline to lift The wood-king's heart upon thy sabre point, For thou hast learned the sleight of fence, no fear, From Galilean trainers, and hast wrought, In thy maraudings, miracles of skill! Rejoice in thine ovation, Nazarene! Thou art the Sylla of the games to-day. The Samnite mock-fight and the chariot race, Myrmillo and the Gaul, the net and mail— All shall give place to thee and Nubia's beast. And while thy glory soars, sweet Venus wraps Her arms around thy love, and sunset melts On the pavilion of her soft delight, Where she doth wanton in Love's revelries, And kisses from her roselight lips reward My service in the honor of thy name, And fair flowers fan the glowing cheek of bliss!”— “Mock on, blood drinker! Mariamne mocks Thee and thy wanton minions, whereso'er Beneath the Orcus of your power she dwells. Seek not through her dominion o'er my heart! She hears a voice sweeter than Memnon's, feigned To breathe daybreak farewells when o'er the blue Of lustrous morn Aurora's gemlight fled; She feels the viewless presence of her God— Earth has no power upon her stainless soul! Therefore, again, I tell thee Rome shall wail For all her havocs, treasons, spoils and plagues. Oh, every empire of her vast domains Hath its aceldama, where voices howl Anathemas the future shall fulfil. All power is venal through her fated realms. The rebel's Rubicon o'ersweeps the land, And all its waves are blood! proscription's code. Taught by the triumvir, is the only law Left by unanswering Cæsar unannulled. How many ages with their agonies Have perished since the people had a choice Of their oppressors? What's the ordeal, now, Censors and consuls must endure? and where The simple wreath that stories tested deeds? All the sweet shadowings of old phantasie, The enchantments of religion, false and vain, But glowing, in its earliest dreams, with love— Arion and the dolphin, Orpheus, And hymning groves, and awful Dis defied By passion in bereavement, daring death, The Sungod's pæans o'er the Cyclades, The charmed illusions of the Blessed Isles, The mystery and rapture of high thought, That from the sacred porticoes and banks Of beautiful Ilissus poured its light O'er Tyber and the haunts of Tusculum— All, now, have vanished—and the powers of air, Your fathers deemed their witnesses, receive From atheist scoffers of the time defiled Derision; and emasculated vice Gloats over memories e'en Pan might loathe. —Breathe not a hope that vengeance will forget! A darker doom, than his whose savage eyes Glared from the marshes of Minturnæ 36—comes; A destiny more terrible than his Who died blaspheming in corruption's arms, Shameless in shame, at Puteoli—lours! The voice of judgment hath pronounced on sin Extinction—and the Avengers are abroad! From the Ister and the Rha, the storm-lashed shores Of the Codanus and Verginian sea— From glacier steep and torrid crag—from vale And wilderness—city and waste—shall rush Devourers; and a thousand years shall weep In darkness o'er her desolated pomp, And thousand times ten thousand vassal hearts Live without love and die without regret, Boasting their bondage, and in titles won By pandering to an earth-fiend's lust, exult, And call their shame patrician privilege! The Goth hath trod the citadel; the Gaul, The Scythian and the Vandal and the Hun Shall reap the harvest of her ruin! Time Wafts on the terrible revenge—the doom Challenged by centuries of guilt!—I hear The tocsin and the gong—the clarion blast, The roar of savage millions in their wrath— Barbarian yells like billows broke by rocks— And where the splendor of the imperial reign Floats now—I see a hoary head o'ercrowned 38 By the three diadems of earth, hell, heaven— And the bright land of plenty trod by bands Of bandits, famished peasants, coward chiefs— All of Rome buried save the tyranny!” “Oh, thou with the Cumæan prophetess Hast hiddenly consorted and pored on The almagest of Ptolemy till stars And meteors have become the ministers Of thy distempered fashionings of fate!” Sardonic smiles o'er revel's swollen lips Passed slowly, and the Prætor's jest had now E'en from the venal sycophants small praise; For crime in common natures, once unveiled, Startles the practiser, and fear becomes His hell, o'ermastering his daunted heart. “And thou art thrilled by the sublime, and all The grandeur of thy destiny o'ercomes Thy sense with its vast radiance! yet shrink not, Though thou with Epaphroditus shalt live, Empedocles and Barcochab, in fame, 39 Drawn in a prophet's robes and mural crown! My own embraces shall solace the grief Of thy rare Hebrew Venus, though thou diest, And, if in dungeon thou art yet reserved, A conqueror now, to grace the future games, To her I will rehearse the tale and laud Thy victory—and 'tis hard but beauty sheds A guerdon on my service!—Dost thou smile?” “Ay, that thou talkst of future games, doomed lord! And utterest thy revenge in mockeries! Yon sun, mid brazen heavens and sulphur clouds, Now hastening to the horizon, ne'er shall rise On the volcano cities; palace and shrine, The battlemented fortress, festive dome, Palæstra, amphitheatre and hall Of judgment wrested to the despot's ends— The household hearth—the stores of merchandise— And many a lofty impious heart shall lie, Shrouded and sepulchred in seas of flame, Ere morrow breaks, beneath the burning deep. And ages shall depart—and meteors glare, And constellations vanish in the void Of the pale azure—and a thousand times Earth's generations perish—ere the beams Of morn shall light the cities of the Dead! Quaff, feast, sing, laugh, exult and mock! ye eat The Lectisternian banquet 40—to the dead Pour out libations—gorge the appetite— Madden the brain—let Phrygian flutes inspire Your latest joys—be merry with the storm That howls e'en now along the Fire-Mount's depths! For me, the martyr trusts his martyred God! And not for all your grandeur—nor for earth's, Would he partake your banquet and your doom!” “Away! away! slaves! drag the traitor hence! And with the gladiators in the cells Let him await the combat of the beast! My spirit wearies of his raven croak. —So, now for better mirth! and yet he shouts Of hurrying multitudes unto the games Invoke my presence and the dial shades The hour of carnage—do ye cry for blood? By Jove! ye shall not lack, for never gazed Imperial Nero on the sea of flame, That surged along the shrieking capitol, With such a rapture as my soul shall feel 18 To watch the lingering agonies and breathe The last deep death sighs and slow muttered groans Of that accursed despiser of my power! Come, friends! the people shall be pampered now. One cordial cup to vengeance—then away! The chariot races wait my word—the shouts Rise like the roar of ocean o'er the hills, And in the ghastly hell light of the mount, Beneath whose deeps the Titans groan, the steeds Caparisoned upon the towers uprear Their heads, struggling to spring upon their course; And yon vast cloud of faces through the gloom Looks with a ruthlessness that fits my mood.— I mount the Tribune! let the games begin!” END OF CANTO II.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE LAST NIGHT OF POMPEII. CANTO III. 'Tis night in autumn, and, methinks, the clouds, That waft the storms of equinox, along The sunset seas of troubled light, uplift Their countless shapes of mystery and might, On which the watcher of Endymion now Not e'en a glimpse of her wan beauty casts,— As erst, they rose o'er Athens, when, condemned By all profaneness and impure desires, The Titan evils of a rebel time, The Attic sage, 41 amid the sobbed farewells Of his disciples, drank the hemlock cup. His spirit, for his birthage and the men That by their deeds blasphemed it, all too pure, Shrined in its sanctuary thoughts revealed Unto no other in dim heathendom; And as his calm benign eyes through the folds Of the earth brooding tempest saw the realms Where immortality to one sole God Hymned anthems in felicity of love, He blessed the few who dared be just when Hate, (Deferred, till from the holy Delian Isle, Which neither birth nor death might desecrate, The pilgrim barque brought the Theori home), Reigned, amid idols, with archdæmon power. Then, with the gentle sadness of the good, His soul forgave the foes that wrought his fate, Callias, Anytus and the viper bard Famed Aristophanes—and prayed in peace! Thus, casting from his tried and weary heart Sorrow and sin, and giving back to earth The passions born of dust, the Martyr Sage Ascended unto Being's fountain stream To meet the mercy he so greatly gave. With such a night around me, let me tread, In these far years, his path, and clothe my thought With a forbearing patience under wrong, Neglect, rebuke and ill rewarded toil, That so, like the aurelia, I may rise From dust, and be a winger of the air! Bereavement's lone lamenting tears and gleams Cast from the memory of the dead, were all The rainbows of my childhood: harsh behest And bitter blame begot in solitude The mood of melancholy; shadowed rills And forests mantled with fantastic vines And peaks the lightning made its home, became The accustomed haunts of boyhood that ne'er knew In bondage the free sunny thoughts of youth. (Hate's serpent tongue hath ever on me shed Its poison, and with lidless vigilance Storied the trials of the fatherless In the dark volume of its deep revenge.) Then, with but one in all the world to love, I burst the thraldom of my orphan days, And wandered forth to live in antique lore; Yet anxious present, pale remembrance, clouds Prophetic gloomed along the deathless page And hoarded in my heart their oracles. From the magnificence of power, the charm Of poesy and visions of old pomp, I woke to feel the friendlessness of earth And know myself a homeless pilgrim here. Then manhood came; the world stirred round my way, And Time's ambition, eagle-eyed, I saw Was man's one worshipped idol, yet I sought No fellowship, but shunned the strife that sears Youth's bosom with the torch that guides to fame. Fame! 'tis the dew-hour's solitary dream, The sighed breath of the midnight, heard alone By mocking phantoms whose reply is—death! Fame! 'tis the madness of consuming thought, Toiling in tears, aspiring in despair, That steals in Love's delirium, o'er the brain, And, while it buries childhood's purest joys, Wakes manhood's dreamy agonies to life! Fame! 'tis the voice of sepulchres, to earth Uttering the praises of the gone—the hymn Of the dust shrouded, over pale decay, And sounding to the spheres the name of him Who loved unloved and trusted traitor hearts, Whose bread was bitterness, whose years, a curse! Fame! 'tis the sunbow o'er the abyss of Time— A glance can melt it into showers of tears! A glacier, hanging from a shattered peak— A breath can bring the glittering ruin down! A dream of glory with the seraphim— Death's shadows gather round it in the dawn! Therefore, I sought not power but peace, and love Was my heart's paradise—the guiltless home Of all my wandering and tumultuous thoughts. But that was blighted by the breath of hate, And the relentless perjuries of men O'erspread the mirrored mind with tempest clouds. The hues of morn and evelight, virgin buds Kissed by Aurora, woods, beneath whose wings The fragrance and the music of glad life Breathed, and the myriad charms that solitude Folds mid the throbs of its deserted heart, Yet o'er me hold dominion; but the light Of their first beauty and the tenderest voice Of Nature, throned in holy ministries, That, in my earlier days, fell on my soul Like seraphim revealings, wear not now The magic loveliness which memory feels. Torrents of wrongs and calumnies, hurled out From the Gehenna of revenge to fall Upon the Hinnom of the world, have raised In me the spirit of a dreadless scorn And multiplied contempt of human thoughts, And these with thee, O Nature! mingle not. But time hath its atonement though I sink Beneath the burden of blaspheming speech, And die beneath the Upas in my youth; And to the Avenger of far ages now I do devote the ruined shrine, and raise The incense of a spirit dimmed by tears, Yet visited in loneliness by hymns Of heaven and stars of glory wandering down. But now the shadows of the buried move Around me—beautiful and haughty forms— Waked from the sleep of centuries to endure, Again, the vanities of earth's best joys, The certainties of evil—(mind restores The dead)—and havoc cries ascend the heavens From Pompeii's waiting thousands, while the groans Of the convulsed volcano answer them. The feeble and the famishing and slaves, Whose toil a thousand years cannot reveal, Alone are seen upon the public ways; And every face is chronicled with care, Loathing the lingering lapse of wasted breath, The purposeless continuance of low toil And want and thankless servitude, amid The meshes of a wan and dim despair. All else find pastime in the savageness Of games where smiles and shouts are bought with blood. Quæstor and ædile, senator and knight, Censor and flamen, vestal and courtesan, 19 Noble and commoner, commingling, meet Amid the portent horrors of the day, Whose shuddering light to Pompeii bids farewell, In torture to seek rapture, in the pangs Of gladiators gored and Christians gashed And mangled to proclaim their ecstacies! The dicer in the midst suspends his skill, Tested by spoil wrung from the heart of want, To witness and applaud the guiltier tests Of science; and the banqueter forsakes The wanton wassail of the flesh to seek The richer revel of the bandit mind. The spotless vestals the electric fire Of Vesta's shrine desert and through their veils Gaze, from the podium 42 of patrician pride, On sinless blood poured o'er the trampled sand From the hot veins of causeless strife; the judge Bears from the Forum the remorseless thoughts, Which, petrified by usage, have become His Nature, never thrilled by mercy's voice. The matron, whom dishonor dares not name; The virgin in her beauty angel pure; The warrior, who, like Blenhiem's victor, ne'er The stategy of pale retreat had learned In the swift triumph of his bannered march; The merchant, whose integrity no thought Assails; the poet from his dreams of eld, Elfland and wizardy and fabled gods; Sages, by their disciples canonized, Who from Saturnian visions, feigning power Without oppression and republics stained By no corruptions, bosomed mid the bowers Of the Evening Isles or Orcades—arise To look upon the agonistes' face Imaging hell, and with the Circus' shouts Mingle the fiats of philosophy! 43 And augurs to perfect their oracles Come now to gaze upon the cloven heart And watch the spasms of Nature's utter throes. And Pompeii's might and affluence await The Prætor's voice, and the vast fabric gleams With million glances and with million cries Echoes, as from the tribune now the word Of Power commands—“Lo! let the games begin!” Cheered by the charioteers, who proudly stand, Reining their fury, round the battlement Rush the barbed chargers, like the samiel cloud O'er Zara when the tropic burns with death; And breathless watchers, who, upon the race, Risk many a talent, when they would deny The alms of one poor obolus to woe, Hang waiting sudden triumph or despair. One wins, the prelude closes, and the host, Like winds amid a wilderness of leaves, Sink down and to the dread arena turn. The trumpet summons—awful silence floats Over the multitudes who fix their gaze Upon the portals of the cells beneath. They open and the gladiators move Round the thronged circle to display their forms Athlete and strong, and with the voice of death Salute the ruthless Genius of the Games. 44 From many a kingdom thralled they come—from realms Spoiled by the locust hordes of Rome; the Gaul, The Briton and the Thracian and the Frank, The Wehrmanne and the Hebrew and the Celt, Every clime's vanquished—every age's wreck, All codes and creeds, strangers or friends, contend Here in assassin strife to please their lords. One deep wild shout like breaking billows swells, Hailing the victims of the carnage fiend, And on the sands two stalwart forms alone Remain; and now Sigalion, voiceless god Of Memphian mysteries, of all the host Seems sovereign, such a quivering stillness hangs Over the thousands, who await the fray With eyes electric as the ether fires, Lips sealed by passion, hearts, like lava, still In their intensest rapture! Bickering swords Clash quickly, yet, with matchless skill, each blow Or thrust falls on the flashing steel; and long, With fixed eyes dropping not their folded lids, And marble lips, and brows whereon the veins Burn like the storm bolt o'er ice pinnacles, And heaving bosoms, naked in their strength, And limbs in every attitude of grace And power—they struggle, not in hope of fame, To win dominion, or achieve revenge; But by their toil and agony and blood To amuse the languid masters of the world. From the free forest where he walked a king, From his hearth's altar where he stood a priest, Hither, in manacles, was guiltless man Dragged for a mockery and gory show! An erring glance—and o'er a prostrate form Of beauty stands the unrejoicing foe, Sternly receiving from the merciless The still command to slay! and now he lifts His serried sabre purpled to the hilt With that heart's blood he might have deeply loved! One groan—a gasp—a shudder—and a soul Hath gone to join the myriad witnesses Who in the winds of northern wilds invoke The Desolators to avenge their doom. While o'er the sands they drag the dead, and strew The place of carnage with uncrimsoned dust, Mirth reigns and voices mingle everywhere, Lauding the skill of the barbarian's strife And the fine anguish of the dying slave. Some talk of Titus, deeming him too just And mild and generous while conspiracy Mutters Domitian and Locasta's cup. 45 And some relate, looking upon the mount, Traditions of volcanoes direr far Than aught they have to fear in latter days; The depths of mountains boiling—valleys filled With o'erthrown hills—and islands through the floods Of ocean, apparitions, to the stars Casting the torrid terrors of their birth. Some say, the Prætor, when the lustrum ends, Will govern Syria, and the sage surmise That confiscation in Campania bought The Senate's will that he should rule the east. Wine, love, the dance, war, wealth, ambition, hate, Earthquake, plague, priesthood, revel, rival sects In faith or knowledge—yesterday's delights, To-morrow's deeds—each, all, in various speech, Absorb the mind until the trumpet sounds. Again, scarce breathing stillness falls—again The gladiators enter, and the strife, Protracted but to close in death, goes on. A Briton, from the land of Caradoc, Whose daily breath had been Plinlimmon's breeze, Beneath the weapon of the Gaul pours out Blood glowing with the soul of liberty, And dies, to Druid altars in the realm Of Mona, breathing back his heart, whose voice Andraste, 46 in her home of vengeance, hears. Triumphant shouts and quick expiring shrieks, Dread silence and hurrahs and agonies Succeed each mortal fray; and oft the sands, Dabbled by gory fingers, trampled o'er By feet that fail beneath the crushing strength Of the grim joyless victors—are fresh strewn To bury blood which sunk not into earth, But from beholding heaven drew down the wrath That made almighty Rome, to every land, A curse, a mockery and a shuddering jest. “Three spirits wander by the spectre stream! Are the great people glutted with the gore?” Said Diomede, for Pansa's trial hour With an exulting patience waiting long. “Sound for the Christians and the desert king! It darkens hurriedly and lava hail Hurtles amid the ashes! we may rob The God of Triumph of the Apostates' blood, Or lose the rapture of their agonies. Throw wide the portals! let the Christians come!” The mitred ministers of idol rites Came on in bannered pomp and conscious power, Circling the arena; and the lictor guard Followed with Pansa, and another form That shrunk and faltered as ten thousand eyes Searched out the fear that harrowed his pale heart. Slow to the wail of Lydian flutes and blast Of clarions breathing death, with looks of awe Feigned and drooped eyes of mystery, around Moved the procession; and the Præsul's 47 gaze Wandered, in haughty majesty, along The risen and revering host he blessed. Few think, for thought is born of pain, and night Hath not repose, nor day, free bliss to him Whose spirit's rapt; yet all can feel and fear, For that is flesh—the earth-born shadows cast Around them by their destinies; and they, Who dwell in earth's abundance and from domes, Stately and glistering, issue to receive Guerdons of gold for oracles of wrath, Illume not, save with fires of hell, the gloom That curtains the black portal of the grave. Virtue needs no interpreter, and vice, Like palace tombs, mocks its own turpitude, When painted o'er with saintly imageries; But Faith, that searches not, dreads every dream, Becoming to itself a hell, and seeks Heaven through the pontiff, who, in secret doubt Of joys elysian, craves earth's richest gifts, And at his votary's phantom banquet smiles. Before the image—wrought by Phidias, when His faithless country unto rival realms Banished his genius—of the supreme Jove, The Præsul paused, and with adoring zeal Cast incense on the altar; and soft wreaths Of perfumed vapor round the eagle's beak, The lifted sceptre and most godlike brow, 20 (The artist's mind was the sole deity) Curled as in homage, and one blended voice Burst from the thousands—“Supreme Jove is God!” Then all the priests from every fane and all The accolytes and soldiers incense flung, And the proud statue proudly seemed to smile. Next, bent and trembling, blind and dumb with fear, A Christian came (from noisome catacombs Dragged forth to prove his feebleness of faith,)— Like the great Pisan 48 who from midnight heavens Could summon the eternal stars and fill His angel spirit with their glories, yet Abjured, in fear, before his bigot foes, All the magnificence of thought, and knelt, A hoar apostate, in the dust, to win The lingering torture of a few sad hours, And live—a monument of mind dethroned! Onward he came with tottering childhood's step, And with a face to all but terror dead. He loved the light, adored the truth, yet dared Meet not the perills it revealed; and now Unto the altar's horns he clung and gasped His panic breath, and gazed beseeching round In utter horror's wilderment, and groped Amid the shrine lights for the frankincense, With quivering fingers hurriedly; but Fear Had quenched soul, feeling, sense—and, as his hand Moved o'er the porphyry with a mindless aim, And the wild pantings of his bosom spread Hues ghastlier than death's along his cheek, A stern centurion, with a frown of scorn And sickened pity, from the censer took The idol odor and upon the palm Of the apostate threw it with a curse; And ere the lapse of thought, his worship flashed On the stern aspect of the demon god! And, onward borne triumphantly, he passed To meet, through every hour of haunted time, Derision for denial of his Lord! Hate on his brow and in his heart revenge, (By bigot pride, scorned power and baffled lust Engendered like the serpent on the waste) Diomede glared upon the lofty form That now before the awful statue stood. No pride, lightening defiance, in his eye, Dared the despair of fortune; no wild faith Waited for miracles; but there he stood, Beautiful in the magnificence of Truth, Before the haughty scorners of chained beings, The mightiest and most merciless of earth, His thought above the proudest of them all, (For Roman mind to Christian creed was wed) And on the countless eyes, that watched him, looked With the sublime serenity unknown To natures weak or terrible as hours And their events decree. No joy, no pain, Changed the fixed features of a calm resolve; No glance betrayed a triumph in his fate, Or doubt that might avert his martyrdom. Upon the still crowd rose his gentle eyes Blue and translucent as the heaven, as erst The sungod, gliding up the glacier steeps Of Hæmus, o'er the tossed ægean cast His deathless smile among the Cyclades. Pure in his faith and passionless in truth, He never sought to seal with agony The creed of the Anointed, but, instead, Shunned Paynimrie's resort and dwelt in wilds, Distrusting the infirmities that oft O'ersway the spirit; but the fated hour Had not passed by—the one deep love, that chained His heart to earth, was parted, it might be To welcome him to paradise, if not, To meet his welcome there; and now, beyond The tyrant passions of the world, he stood Dauntless mid heathendom, and thus, in tones Strong as the ocean's, in whose utter deeps The Alps may sink, yet leave vast deeps above, He to the image of the Thunderer spake. “Thou breathless Mocker of the humbled mind! Thou Idol Image of remorseless power! Shall being, quickened by the glowing blood, In worship bow to thee, a sculptured block? Shall intellect, illumed and magnified, Whose home is ether, whose immortal hope Is deathless glory, render unto thee The adoration of the Deity? Oh, how should men be just when they have throned Amid the universe, o'erswaying all, A supreme vengeance—demon deified? Whose common and commended deeds would crown A mortal with the curses of the world, And round him spread a solitude of hate Haunted alone by grovelling infamies! Well wast thou fabled—son of Earth and Time! For all impurities and ills are thine, Transformed despoiler! e'en thy votaries mock Yet mimic thee, as well they may, the work Of their own lusts! Canst thou call forth one star Of all that blossom in the boundlessness Of that undying heaven unknown to thee? Will Mazzaroth or Mythra soar or sink? Or terrible behemoth leave his depths? Or the proud desert bird feel nature's love? Because thou bidst? doth thine own eagle fear The power men quail at? or the tempest float Along Olympus, hurling arrowy fires, In reverence to thy hest? yet why is this? Methinks, I wander back to Pagan faith, Thus questioning the hewn marble, which portrays The apotheosis of man's worst revenge! Beneath the unimaged, unimagined God, Who hath no temple but infinity, Where the great multitude of stars adore, Flying along their glorious spheres—I stand Here in thy home (it fits thy nature well) And, without awe or exultation, dare Deny thee incense, prayer, love, fear and faith!” Not louder in its burning temple roared The dread volcano when the firestorm came, And earth's abysses quivered in their wrath, Than now the voices of the phrenzied host. “Tear the blasphemer! let the wild beasts forth To rend his limbs and gnash his living heart! Impale the accursed! chain him within the fire! Saw him asunder! cast his viper tongue Into the serpents' den to poison them!” Thus thousands shrieked—yet now the shoutings changed. “Hark! Jove the Avenger answers! lo! the heavens With shuddering clouds are filled and lightnings leap Through their gored bosoms and the thunder shaft Bickers along the air—great Jove beholds And hears—now wither, thou blaspheming slave!” Awed yet untrembling, Pansa calm replied. “Ye hear no thunder—but Destruction's howl! Ye see no lightning—but the lava glare Of desolation sweeping o'er your pride! Death is beneath, around, above, within All who exult to inflict it on my heart, And ye must meet it, fly when where ye will, For in the madness of your cruelties Ye have delayed till every hope is dead. Let the doom come! our faiths will soon be tried. Gigantic spectres from their shadowy thrones, With ghastly smiles to welcome ye, arise. The Pharaohs and Ptolemies uplift Their glimmering sceptres o'er ye—bidding all Bare their dark bosoms to the Omniscient God: And every strange and horrid mythos waits To fold ye in the terrors of its dreams. —For thee, proud Prætor! throned on human hearts And warded by thy cohorts from the arm Of violated virtue and spurned Right, And suffering's madness—though thy regal tomb Cepolline proudly stand, thy scattered dust Shall never sleep within it; years shall fade And nations perish and ten thousand kings With all their thrice ten thousand victories Rest in oblivion, and the very earth Change with the changes of her children, yet The empty mansion of thy vain renown Shall stand that generations unconceived May ask the deeds of him who was cast out By vengeance from his fathers' sepulchres!” “Let loose the wild beasts on him! why are we Thus left to bear the traitor's arrogance? The convict's scorn? the gladiator's speech? Let loose the only foe that fits his faith; The Mauretanian's arguments are meet And suit his mystic cabala. Throw wide The cells and let the lion make reply.” “The outer corridors,” the Lanista said, “Are filled with ashes, and within the vaults Arches have fallen and no power can ope The portal of the Atlas beast, my lord!” “Bring a ballista, then, and shatter it! For by the eternal Fates and all the Gods! This darer and blasphemer shall not scape. Let none depart! why, would the people shun The luxury of this despiser's pangs, Or doth his airy talk infect your souls And sway your thoughts by oracles of woe? Spare Nazarenes! who would o'erturn the creed And code of Rome, and on the throne of earth Exalt the image of a felon God! Gather your wisdom, men!—so, dash to earth The portal and goad on the savage king!” Still by Jove's altar standing, Pansa looked Upon the fluctuating host around, Some with fear trembling, some with baffled hate, Some silent in excess of passion, some Most earnest to behold the game of death, And thus, like a cathedral knell, he spake. “I show ye mercy none will show to me! 21 Fly! ere the banners of the galleys wave Beyond the cape! fly, ere the earth and air Become the hell that fiction fables! fly Ere carnage shrieks amid the torrent fire! For me 't is nought—for you, 't is all—away!” Yet, mocking truth and justice, all from flight Turned back, and in the joy of shedded blood Leaned o'er the arena. From the shattered cell The famished lion sprung, with coiling mane And fiendish eyes and jaws that clashed for gore. “Take thy sword, Christian! at thy foot it lies— And let the heathen, as thou callest them, mark And laud thy skill in combat! take thy sword!” A demon smile convulsed the Prætor's lip, Yet Pansa, in the deep unshaken voice Of Truth's immortal sanctity replied. “The Martyr needs no weapon: his defence, Shield, sabre, helm, spear, banner, all are one. A breath from the Eternal—a quick ray From the immortality of God—he lives But in His mercy, dies but when He wills. —Thou mightiest monarch of the forest beasts! Who from the heights of Atlas, on the brow Of perpendicular precipice alone Planting thine armed foot, hast looked o'er sea And waste, fearing no equal; or among The haunted wrecks of Carthage, in the pangs Of hunger revening, hast found no food Where a great nation died that Rome might reign. Thou fiercest terror of the wilderness! Who, without contest, dost consume thy foe, And walkst the earth a conqueror and a king! Upon thee—though the extreme of famine gnaws Thy vitals now—and thy flesh burns with stripes Given to madden thee, and round and round With Titan limbs thou leapst in bitter joy Of human banquet, watching, with fierce eyes, Terrible as is the simoom of thy clime, The moment of thy certain victory— Upon thee now I fix the eye, whose light Was born of God's Eternity, and while Destruction from the face of Deity Lours o'er creation, I do bid thee kneel There in the gory dust! ay, by the Power Of Him who made thee, monster! I command.” A roar, as if a myriad thunders burst, Now hurtled o'er the heavens, and the deep earth Shuddered, and a thick storm of lava hail Rushed into air to fall upon the world. And low the lion cowered, 49 with fearful moans And upturned eyes and quivering limbs and clutched The gory sand instinctively in fear. The very soul of silence died, and breath Through the ten thousand pallid lips unfelt Stole from the stricken bosoms; and there stood With face uplifted and eyes fixed on air, (Which unto him was thronged with angel forms) The Christian—waiting the high will of heaven. A wandering sound of wailing agony, A cry of coming horror o'er the street Of Tombs arose, and all the lurid air Echoed the shrieks of hopelessness and death. Then through the gates and o'er the city rushed A ghastly multitude, naked and black With sulphur fumes and spotted o'er with marl That clung unto the agonizing flesh Like a wronged orphan's curse. In terror blind, They rushed, in dreadful companies, along The solitary Appian Way, and e'er Their awful voices howled the horrors forth. “Destroyed! wrecked in its beauty—all destroyed! Billows of lava boil above the towers Of Herculaneum! we alone are left! The lovely city! all our happy homes! Buried in blackness 'neath a sea of fire! The deluge came along the shattering rocks— We fled and met another—yet again We turned dismayed and a third fiery flood Came down in ruin's grandeur on our path! Between the mountain and the sea we scaped. Oh, many a corse beneath the depths hath mixed With the consumed, consuming clay, and lo! A Solfatara o'er our city rolls, Boiling in deeps of blackness! on—away! What fated madness holds the death-games now? Rise, Pompeii! fly, the Fates delay not here!” Down to the dark convulsive sea they rushed, O'er them the volcano, and beneath, The earthquake, and around, ruin and death. “Hear ye not now?” said Pansa. “Death is here! Ye saw the avalanche of fire descend Vesuvian steeps, and in its giant strength Sweep on to Herculaneum; and ye cried, “It threats not us, why should we lose the sport? Though thousands perish, why should we refrain?” Your sister city—the most beautiful— Gasps in the burning ocean—from her domes Fly the survivers of her people, driven Before the torrent floods of molten earth With desolation red—and o'er her grave Unearthly voices raise the heart's last cries— “Fly, fly! O horror! O my son! my sire!” The hoarse shouts multiply; without the mount Are agony and death—within, such rage Of fossil fire as man may not behold! Hark! the Destroyer slumbers not—and now, Be your theologies but true, your Jove, Mid all his thunders, would shrink back aghast, Listening the horrors of the Titans' strife. The lion trembles; will ye have my blood? Or flee ere Herculaneum's fate is yours?” Vesuvius answered: from its pinnacles Clouds of far-flashing cinders, lava showers, And seas, drank up by the abyss of fire To be hurled forth in boiling cataracts, Like midnight mountains, wrapt in lightnings, fell. Oh, then, the love of life! the struggling rush, The crushing conflict of escape! few, brief, And dire the words delirious fear spake now— One thought, one action swayed the tossing crowd. All through the vomitories madly sprung, And mass on mass of trembling beings pressed, Gasping and goading, with the savageness That is the child of danger, like the waves Charybdis from his jagged rocks throws down, Mingled by fury—warring in their foam. Some swooned and were trod down by legion feet; Some cried for mercy to the unanswering gods; Some shrieked for parted friends for ever lost; And some, in passion's chaos, with the yells Of desperation did blaspheme the heavens; And some were still in utterness of woe. Yet all toiled on in trembling waves of life Along the subterranean corridors. Moments were centuries of doubt and dread; Each breathing obstacle a hated thing: Each trampled wretch, a footstool to o'erlook The foremost multitudes; and terror, now, Begat in all a maniac ruthlessness, For in the madness of their agonies Strong men cast down the feeble who delayed Their flight, and maidens on the stones were crushed, And mothers maddened when the warrior's heel Passed o'er the faces of their sons! The throng Pressed on, and in the ampler arcades now Beheld, as floods of human life rolled by, The perfect terrors of the destined hour. In gory vapors the great sun went down; The broad dark sea heaved like the dying heart, 'Tween earth and heaven hovering o'er the grave, And moaned through all its waters; every dome And temple, charred and choked with ceaseless showers Of suffocating cinders, seemed the home Of the triumphant desolator Death. One dreadful glance sufficed—and to the sea, Like Lybian winds, breathing despair, they fled. Nature's quick instinct, in most savage beasts, Prophecies danger ere man's thought awakes, And shrinks in fear from common savageness, Made gentle by its terror; thus, o'erawed E'en in his famine's fury by a Power Brute beings more than human oft adore, The Lion lay, his quivering paws outspread, His white teeth gnashing, till the crushing throngs Had passed the corridors; then, glaring up His eyes imbued with samiel light, he saw The crags and forests of the Appenines Gleaming far off, and with the exulting sense Of home and lone dominion, at a bound, He leapt the lofty palisades and sprung Along the spiral passages, with howls Of horror through the flying multitudes Flying to seek his lonely mountain lair. From every cell shrieks burst; hyænas cried Like lost child stricken in its loneliness: The giant elephant with matchless strength Struggled against the portal of his tomb, And groaned and panted; and the leopard's yell And tyger's growl with all surrounding cries Of human horror mingled; and in air, Spotting the lurid heavens and waiting prey, The evil birds of carnage hung and watched, As ravening heirs watch o'er the miser's couch. All awful sounds of heaven and earth met now; Darkness behind the sungod's chariot rolled, Shrouding destruction, save when volcan fires Lifted the folds to gaze on agony; And when a moment's terrible repose Fell on the deep convulsions, all could hear The toppling cliffs explode and crash below, While multitudinous waters from the sea In whirlpools through the channelled mountain rocks 22 Rushed, and, with hisses like the damned's speech, Fell in the mighty furnace of the mount. Tyrant not dastard, daring in his guilt And fearless of its issues, Diomede Frowned on the panic flight and in his wrath Man, earth and heaven, demons and gods defied. “The craven people—e'en my very slaves Have fled as dust-born vassals ever flee, And I am left alone with marble gods And howling savageness, mid showers of flame. Gods! I trust not elysium feigned by them Who make the earth a very mock of hell. Ay, roar, yell, struggle till your fierce hearts burst! And with thy thousand thunders shake the throne Of Jove, Vesuvius! and the world confound! I have not loved nor sought the love of man, And higher than his nature I know not, Nor lower; and alone I sit to laugh At mortal fear and dare immortal hate, For, if aught die not, 't is revenge and pain.” “Hath memory wed with madness that thou sayst `Alone,' proud Prætor? one yet looks on Jove And sees no deity; one yet awaits The pleasure of Campania's haughty lord. The hour and scene fit well the deadly fight, Yet I behold no foe; what wouldst thou more?” Pansa stood motionless and spake in scorn. “Thou damned Nazarene! the imperial law Shall forge new fetters for thy treacheries, Thy necromancies and apostate deeds. Meantime exult, thank, praise and bless thy God, Convict redeemer, buried deity, That my condition fits not contest now With thine, or wolves should ravine on thy limbs And eagles' talons bear to mountain cliffs Thy heart yet quivering with the pulse of fear. Some fiendish potence foils me now; again Thou shalt not win fire-fiends unto thy aid: Yet, Pompeii shall acclaim thine agonies— Again, thou shalt not scape though hell arise!” “Again we shall not meet in all the realms Of universal being—all the hours That linger on eternity! we part For ever now, each to his deathless doom. But had not other creed than vengeance filled A Roman's mind with mercy, words like thine, Now thy prætorians leave us twain, the one With all to lose, the other, all to gain, Would bring a direr parting hour, howe'er Thy Punic blood and Volscian pride revolt. Oh, thou mayst scoff! thou wouldst outdare the fiends And mock in Orcus sin's undying moans; But here we part, proud victim! so, farewell! Jehovah's wrath is o'er thee—o'er us all— The shocked earth cries unto the blackened heavens, The mighty heart of earthly being bursts. And thou shalt quickly know what Hebrew awe Trembled to hear, El Shaddai—'t is a name The phantoms ye adore and curse have borne Vainly—yon mount is its interpreter— The Almighty looks in lightning from His throne. Jove's shrine is covered with the lava shower, The ashes gather round me! oh, farewell!” Through deepening cinders, tossing sulphur clouds, And victims shrieking in their agonies, The Prætor sought his way. His harnessed steeds Maddened by fear, had with his chariot flown, The charioteer had perished 'neath the wheels: And haughtily through all the Appian Way, Among the whirlpool waves of human life, And lighted by destruction's breath of flame, He struggled tow'rd his palace, to the wrath Of heaven fronting defiance, e'en while Death Dwelt in the bosom of all elements And the world trembled! hastening to his dome, Of power in Syrian splendors and a fame Immortal as the flatterer's pander verse, He dreamed; and bearing to the vaulted crypt, Whose labyrinths wandered far beneath the hills, His gold and gems, he on his household closed The marble door, deeming their safety won, Whose strangled death cries rose unheard—whose bones The daily sunlight of a thousand years Ne'er visited beneath the deeps of death. Pansa, meantime, in gladiator guise. By other paths had hurried from the scene, And now beneath the skies, where billowy clouds Rolled in the awful volcan light, beheld The fabric of destruction vast and lone. Vesuvius poured its deluge forth, the sea Shuddered and sent unearthly voices up, The isles of beauty, by the fire and surge Shaken and withered, on the troubled waves Looked down like spirits blasted; and the land Of Italy's once paradise became The home of ruin--vineyard, grove and bower, Tree, shrub, fruit, blossom—love, life, light and hope, All vanishing beneath the fossil flood And storm of ashes from the cloven brow Of the dread mountain hurled in horror down. The echoes of ten thousand agonies Arose from mount and shore, and some looked back Cursing, and more bewailing as they fled, With glowing marl or ashes on their heads. “Thou one great Spirit of all being! here, Where power is helplessness and hope, a dream, Here in the horror of the havoc, breathe Thy smile upon my soul, and time and death, With all their anguish, shall o'erawe me not!” Imploring thus, the Christian held his way Through the wild scene, with undefined impulse, Nor shunning death, nor daring it, but filled With emanations of undying faith. A voice, whose tones, like music heard when youth Lives in the visions of the blue blest heaven, Thrilled the quick heart of Pansa, from the gloom Of a lone street came forth, and bended forms Stole from the hutted refuge of despair, And tow'rd the Appian by the Forum fled. And through the night the voice of age went up.50 “Tarry not, daughter! for these aged limbs, Dust they soon must be—though the world revered— And, if my hour be come, the woe is past. But hasten, daughter! moments have become Ages—the air, the earth, the ocean blend Their agonizing energies—away! Beneath the o'erhung rocks—where fishers wont To moor their boats, now stranded on the beach, The pinnace lies I spake of—and the word Is Marcion! Thither, without let or fear, Hasten: a Christian from Tergeste 51 holds Command, and ere an hour its oars and sails Shall waft you far from ruin round us now.” “Nay, father! to the shadow of your roof I hurried when the violater's wrath Burned o'er me—and thine own familiar fears Denied me not a refuge! we shall sleep Mid fire together or together flee. Yet more—no barque shall bear me from the beach Till the last hope expires that from his bonds Pansa may burst to bear us company. Perchance, among the fugitives, e'en now He flies, and wanders by the ocean marge”— On through the death-storm the Decurion sprung. “No, Mariamne! my beloved restored! Here, in the home of desolation, here, I fold thee spotless to my happy heart! And find my paradise in ruin's arms! But here we pause not to pour out our souls. A pinnace lies beneath the cliffs, sayst thou? Thy hoary wisdom hath redeemed us, sage! Stay thy weak limbs upon my strength! on! on! I snatched the slaughtered gladiator's helm— Cast o'er your heads your mantles—so, away!” Down the steep path unto the moaning sea They passed with quickened steps, and upward glanced The maiden of the vaults of Isis, once, Eyes floating in the farewell tears of love, As by the black and desolated home Of all her childhood's innocence and bliss, They fled like shades and to the ramparts came, Upon them, by the fiend-light full revealed, Wandered the hoary idol priest of Jove In maniac horror; and amidst the roar, The riot and the wreck of earth and heaven, Thus rose his awful voice in prophecies. THE VISION OF THE FLAMEN. Call in thy cohorts, Rome! from every land Thy power hath deluged with unsinning blood! Call in thy legions from Iberia's strand, From Albion's rocks, and Rhætia s mountain wood! The foe, like glaciers hurled Through clouds of lightning on the world, Springs from his forest in the wildest north, Scenting his prey afar: And, like the samiel, from the waste comes forth To steep your glories in the gore of war. Hark! the whole earth rejoices! Sea shouts to isle and mountain unto main, And ocean to the heaven, with myriad voices— Rome's sepulchre shall be amid her slain, And as she spared not, none shall spare her now, But Hun, Goth, Vandal, Alemanne and Frank Shall lift the poison cup all earth hath drank, And steep her shuddering lips, and on her brow Pour blood for ointment, and upon her head, Till thousand ages have in darkness fled, 23 Mocking, press down The accursed crown Which shall not cease to bleed as conquered men have bled!” Thy monarchs, slaves to every lust and crime, Shall fall as they have fallen by the sword Or Colchian chalice, and unweeping time O'erthrow the deities by dust adored, And leave but ruin to lament O'er pillar, shrine and battlement, And solitude o'er desert realms to moan, Where warriors mocked chained kings and called the world their own! The coal black petrel and the grey curlew Shall wing thy waters and see not thy sail; From trembling towers the stork shall watch the blue Of the lone heavens and hear no human hail: For in the vales that bask in bloom, The Pontine's flowers, the bright Maremma's green, Shall dwell the shadow of the tomb, In Love's voluptuous arms, the tyrant death unseen! And Nero's golden house shall be The pallid serf's abode, And tombs imperial, soaring from the sea, Shall guide the corsair through his night of blood. Despair with folded wings, Where the Eagle's pinions hung, Shall cower beneath the throne of kings, Who o'er the Alps the curse of hell have flung, Woe to the beautiful! the barbarian comes! Woe to the proud! the peasant lays thee low! Woe to the mighty! o'er your kingly domes The savage banner soars—the watchfires glow; Triumph and terror through the forum rush, Art's trophies vanish—learning's holy lore,— Alaric banquets while red torrents gush, Attila slumbers on his couch of gore! And there the eye of Ruin roams O'er guilt and grief and desolation; And there above a thousand homes The voice of Ruin mourns a buried nation. Buried. O Rome! not like Campania's cities, To wake in beauty when the centuries flee, But in the vice and coward shame none pities, The living grave of guilt and agony! Alas! for Glory that must close in gloom! Alas! for Pride that loves the tyrant's scorn! Alas! for Fame that from the Scipios' tomb Rises to look on infamy and mourn! But Vengeance, wandering long, With many a battle hymn and funeral song, Shakes Fear's pale slumber from earth's awestruck eyes, And bids Sarmatia's hordes redeem her agonies! Yet not alone the civic wreath, The conqueror's laurel, the triumpher's pride Shall wither 'neath the samiel eye of Death; On Rome's old mount of glory shall abide, Tiar'd and robed like the Orient's vainest kings, The hoar devoter of earth's diadems; 52 His glance shall haunt the heart's imaginings— His footfall shall be felt where misers hoard their gems! And from the palace of the Sacred Hill The thrice crown'd pontiff shall to earth dispense The awful edict of his mighty will, And reign o'er mind in Fear's magnificence. Prince, peasant, bandit, slave shall bow Beneath his throne in vioceless adoration, And years of crime redeem by one wrung vow; And age on age shall die—and many a nation Sink in the shadow of the tyrant's frown And disappear, Without a song or tear, While clarion'd conquerors tread In hymned triumph o'er the dead; And wild barbarian hordes, Whose faith and fealty glitter with their swords, Shall feel the mellowing breath of human love, And dwell entranced amid romance and lore; Yet from the awful Vatican no dove Shall bear freewill to any earthly shore! But he, the Rock amid the ruins old Of mythologic temples, shall o'ersway The very Earth, till thrones and kingdoms sold And cmpires blasted in the blaze of day— Awake the world—and from the human heart The crushing mountain of Oppression cast; Then man shall bid all tyrannies depart, And from the blue blest heavens elysium dawn at last!” “How like the gusty moans of tempest nights O'er the broad winter wilderness, that voice Ascends; and what a horrid gleam is flung Along that face of madness, as it turns From sea to mountain, and the wild eyes burn With revelations of the unborn time! We may not linger—shelter earth denies— The very heavens like a gehenna lour— And ocean is our refuge—on—on—on! Yet hark! the wildest shriek of death! and lo! The priest falls gasping from the ramparts now— The breath of oracles upon his lips, The Future's knowledge in his dying heart, He reels—pants—gazes on the sulphur light— (How like the glare of hell it wraps his form!) Expiring, mutters woe—and falls to sleep Shroudless in the red burial of the doomed! On to the ocean! and, far o'er its waves, To Rhætia's home of glaciers—if God wills— Look not behind! a moment gains the shore!” So Pensa cried and windlike was their flight. The pinnace cleaves the waters; heaving, black And desolate, the dismal billows groan And swell the dirges of the earth and sky. Upon the bosom of the sea, the barque Sweeps on in darkness, save when furnace light Flares o'er the upturned floods; and now they pass The promontory's cliffs, and o'er the deeps Fly like a midnight vision.—From the shores Voices in terror cry, and countless shapes Now in the lava blaze appear—and now Vanish in the fell night, and, far away, Pliny's lone galleys, dimly from their prows Casting their watchlights through the fitful gloom, Hear not the implorings of the fugitives. THE DEATH-CRIES OF POMPEII. FIRST VOICE. Hear us! oh, hear us! will no God reply? No ear of mercy open to our prayer? Hath utter vengeance throned the accursed sky? And must we perish in this wild despair? Hear us! oh, hear us! will no mortal hand Succor in horror—pity in our dread? Woe! Desolation sweeps o'er all the land! Woe! woe! earth trembles 'neath the Death-King's tread! SECOND VOICE. Oh, Fear and Gloom and Madness are around, And hope from earth is vain; The sky is blackness—waves of fire, the ground— And every's bosom's breath—the pulse of pain. Yet let us not deny, In shuddering nature's agony, The universal and immortal King! But, rather, while we gasp, Our dying children closer clasp, [spring! And pass, with them, the wave where blossoms deathless THIRD VOICE. Who bids us sink resigned? Who bids us bless the Slayer? And mid the storm of ruin, blind, Scorched—blasted—dying—breathe again the spurned-back prayer? Let the Creator in his vengeance take The life he heaped on men— No sigh—no voice—no tear shall slake The almighty hatred that could thus condemn! He made us but to die— To die yet see our city's burial first— And he shall feast upon no wailing cry From me:—take what thy wrath has cursed! I yet have power to hate and scorn the might That strews the earth with dead in Desolation's night! FOURTH VOICE. Blaspheme not in thine anguish! We may not hope to linger,— Yet, quickly quenched, we shall not moan and languish In wan disease—emaciating pain— And living death—when e'en an infant finger Would be a burden! oh, the fiery rain Comes down and withers and consumes The mighty and the weak, And not a voice from out yon horrid glooms, That shroud the Sarnus and the sea Replies to hearts that break In agony. Yet shut not out the hope elysian, And fold not darkness to thy breast!— —My babe! oh, sweet, most blest and briefest vision! As at thy birthhour, here's thy home of rest— My bosom was thy pillow—'t is thy tomb— It gave thee life—and, in thine early death, Thy latest throbs to mine— —Oh, like harp thrillings in thy bliss and bloom, While o'er my face stole soft thy odorous breath, They touched my spirit with a joy divine!— Thy latest throbs shall be The warning that shall waft My soul up through the starr'd infinity, E'en where the nectar cup is by the Immortals quaff'd. FIFTH VOICE. And must we die? In being's brightness and the bloom of thought! Sepulchred beneath a sunless sky! And all the spirit's godlike powers be—nought! 24 Wail o'er thy doom, fair boy! Shriek thy last sorrow, maiden! for the doom, That o'er earth's tearless joy Rolls gory mid the shadows of the tomb! The tomb! there shall be none Save dark-red shroudings of the lava sea— The fire shall quench the agonizing groan— Moments become—eternity! And must we perish so? Sink, shuddering, thus and gasp our breath in flame? And o'er our unremembered burial flow The pomps and pageants of a worthless name? At wonted feasts, no voices shall salute— In temple hymns, no soul-breathed strain awake Our memories from the realms for ever mute— But o'er our graves barbarian kings shall slake Their demon thirst of gore— And redcross slayers march in bandit ranks, From Alp and sea and shore, To stain the Asian sands with hordes of slaughtered Franks! Wail for the joy that never more shall breathe! Wail for the lore and love, the bloom and bliss That to the ocean world of fire bequeathe Their paradise of hope! and this Must be our only trust—to quickly die— And leave the pleasant things of earth behind; Through thousand ages unremembered lie Unknown to sunbeam smile or breath of summer wind!” DIOMEDE, (rushing in.) “Away! bewailers of decrees that bring Rest to the grief and restlessness of earth! Away! pale tremblers mid the dawn of spring That o'er the winter of your fate comes forth! What are your woes to his, Who from the throne of power beheld the glory— Ambition's grandeur, pleasure's bliss, Gleam on the Syrian towers like gods in minstrel story? Gone! gone! why, see ye not the eyes Of hell's own Furies glaring through the flame? And hear ye not the wild, deep, dreadful cries That call in curses on the Avenger's name? No barque to bear us o'er the sea! No refuge on the mountain's breast! Earth, time, and hope like unblest shadows flee, And death and darkness pall our everlasting rest! What spectre sail sweeps you? Now in the black night buried—now upon The billow in the horrid light careering. Like a spirit that hath passed The glacier and the Lybian blast, It feels not human fearing! It flies toward the promontory now— The torrent fire of ruin hangs above— And earthly forms are standing by the prow, Clasped in the arms of love! O Hell of Thought! and must I—in the fame Of sumless wealth and power—sink down and die, And, helpless, hopeless, leave the Prætor's name To moulder with the herd's beneath The mountain monument of death, And be a doubt, or mock and scorn To fierce barbarians, yet unborn, When in the spoiler's lust, they seek the Italian sky? Ay, curse the gods who in their hate created The serpent death that gnaws your core of life! E'en in your childhood's beauty, ye were fated To writhe, howl, shudder, perish in the strife Of elemental agonies, As were your sires by ghastly wan disease; And wrath, shame, guilt, despair, remorse and pain, Their heritage and testament, have swept Your hearts as vultures sweep the battle plain! Then by the tears unpitied grief hath wept, By lone bereavement's wail, And Evil's dark ovations, Bid universal Ruin hail! And swell Death's monarch march o'er buried nations! For me—as fits the Roman lord, When hopeless peril darkens on his way, I crave no lingering tortures with the horde Who gasp and grovel in the slave's dismay, And to the sick and sulphurous air, Where Gloom and Fire and Horror dwell, Pour out to fiction's gods the unheard prayer, And seek in clouds a heaven, to find on earth a hell! Thou one Omnipotent Despair! Whose shadow awes the prostrate world, Thou kingly Queller of lamenting care! Oblivion's voiceless home prepare, And let Extinction's lightning bolt be hurled! Banished, yet dauntless, doomed but undismayed, Least willing, yet without a groan or sigh, I go—dark Nemesis! thou art obeyed! Thou awful Cliff! the billow's funeral cry Thrills through my quickened sense, That feels with life intense, Yet, ere a moment's lapse, this soul shall sleep— This form, a sweltering corse, beneath the unsounded deep!” Thus to the proud heart's last throb breathing out Defiance and blaspheming wrath—though wrecked And ruined, hurling his terrific thoughts Of baffled vengeance to the shuddering heavens— A monumental Memnon, sending up Death's music to the burning hills of death— Upon the extremest edge of awful cliffs, That beetled o'er the blackened billows now Howling their dirges o'er the expected dead, The haughty Prætor stood alone, and flung His agonizing spirit's deadliest glance, The farewell execrating look of pride, Unquenched by horror, unsubdued by death, O'er hill, shore, forest, ocean—earth and heaven; Then, towering like a rebel demigod, And to the fierce volcano turning quick His brow of fearful beauty, while his lips Curved with convulsive curses, o'er the rocks— Down—down the void, black depths, like a bann'd star, (That tosses through the universe, a hell,) Or demon from a meteor mountain's brow, He plunged and o'er him curled the shivering floods! Meantime, charred corses in one sepulchre Of withering ashes lay, and voices rose, Fewer and fainter, and, each moment, groans Were hushed, and dead babes on dead bosoms lay, And lips were blasted into breathlessness Ere the death kiss was given, and spirits passed The ebbless, dark, mysterious waves, where dreams Hover and pulses throb and many a brain Swims wild with terrible desires to know The destinies of worlds that lie beyond. The thick air panted as in nature's death, And every breath was anguish; every face Was terror's image, where the soul looked forth, As looked, sometimes, far on the edge of heaven, A momentary star the tempest palled. From ghastlier lips now rose a wilder voice, As from a ruined sanctuary's gloom, Like savage winds from the Chorasmian waste Rushing, with sobs and suffocating screams: And thus the last despair had utterance. SIXTH VOICE. “It bursts! it bursts! and thousand thunders blent, From the deep heart of agonizing earth, Knell, shatter, crash along the firmament, And new hells peopled startle into birth. Vesuvius sunders! pyramids of fire From fathomless abysses blast the sky; E'en desolating Ruin doth expire, And mortal Death in woe immortal die, Torrents like lurid gore, Hurled from the gulf of horror, pour, Like legion fiends embattled to the spoil, And o'er the temple domes, And joy's ten thousand homes, Beneath the whirlwind hail and storm of ashes boil. The surges, like coil'd serpents, rise From midnight caverns of the deep, And writhe around the rocks, That shiver in the earthquake's shocks, And through the blackness of fear's mysteries, Chained Titans from their beds of torture leap, And o'er the heavens Eumenides Seek parting souls for prey— Oh God! that on these dark and groaning seas Would soar one other day! Vain is the mad desire, Darkness, convulsion, fire, Infernal floods, dissolving mountains, fold The helpless children of woe, sin and Time— O'er fiery wrecks hath Desolation rolled, The Infinite Curse attends the finite crime! No melancholy moon to gaze With dim cold light remote! No star, through stormy spheres, with holy rays, O'er dying eyes, like hope of heaven, to float! No spot—the oasis of the waste above— Whose still, sweet beauty glistens Through clouds that heave and riot in wild masses, Breaks on the breaking heart! no seraph listens In blue pavilions, while the spirit passes, And o'er the dreariest waters bears, Beyond the unburied's desert shore, To skies ambrosial and elysian airs, Where e'en the awful Destinies adore! No tenderness from lips, Blackened and swoln and gasping, steals Amidst the soul's eclipse; 25 Each, in the solitude of misery, feels, Ineffable, his own despair, And sinks unsolaced, unsolacing, down, O'ercanopied by sulphurous air, Palled, tombed by seas that terror's last cry drown! Oh, still the piteous cry Mounts up the heavens—“fly! fly!” “Whither?” the billows roar Among the wrecks and rent crags of the shore. “Whither?” the Volcano's voice Repeats, bidding pale death rejoice. Oh, Hope with madness dwells, And love of life creates the worst of deaths; Hark! world to world ten thousand voices swells— “Resign your breaths!” We die; the sinner with the sinless dies, The bud, the flower, the fruit corruption wastes, Childhood and hoar age blend their agonies, Destruction o'er the earth—the missioned slayer hastes.” Swiftly along the Pæstan gulf before The Alpine gale, scudded the Christians' barque; Night veiled Lucania's rugged shore but oft The dreadful radiance of the firemount hung Upon the mightiest Apennines, and there The giant cliffs, hoar forest trees, and glens Of cataracts—gleamed on the fear-charmed eye, Distinct though distant; and Salernum's crags Spurned the chafed sea that rushed before the prow. “Lo! Pliny's galleys speed to aid at last!” Said Pansa, gazing through the meteor light, Towards the Sarnus and the victim host. “All shall not perish; oars and sails bear on The Roman armament—and now, in hope Renewed exulting, from the dust upspring A thousand prostrate shapes, and on the rocks Lift their scorched hands, and shout (though we hear not) The late rescuers on; yet many a heart Will throb and thrill no more, but buried lie, Like its own birthplace, till oblivion rests On the Campanian cities and their guilt. —Salernum's rocks for ever from our gaze Hide the dark scene of trial, and we leave, With swelling canvass, Rome's imperial realm, Where Christian faith shall, like the sandal tree, Impart its odor to the feller's axe, To seek a hermitage in wilds afar. —Now, as we hasten, let our spirits soar To Him who shelters when the avenger slays!” THE FAREWELL OF THE CHRISTIANS. PANSA. “Alone, in darkness, on the deep, Spirit of Love! redeemed by thee, While fear its watch o'er ruin keeps, Thy grace our sign and shield, we flee. The billows burst around our barque, The death streams roll and burn behind— Thy mercy guides our little ark, Thy breath can swell or hush the wind. Thy footsteps ruffled not the wave When drowning voices shrieked for aid— The cavern'd billow yawn'd—a grave— “Be still!” it heard Thee and obeyed! From idol rites and tyrant power, Now o'er the midnight sea we fly— Be with us through our peril's hour! Saviour! with Thee we cannot die! MARIAMNE. “To men a mocked and homeless stranger, Thy truth, love, grace and goodness blest The world, whose first gift was a manger, Whose last, the Cross! no down of rest Pillowed, O Christ! thy holy head, No crown, but thorns, Thy temples wreathed, Yet Thou the Death King captive led, And through the tomb a glory breathed! The scorner all Thy love reviled, Thy path was pain, thy kingdom, shame, Yet sorrow on thine aspect smiled, E'en Death revered Thy deathless name! The bittern moans where Zion stood, The serpent crawls where nations trod— Be with us on the mountain flood! Fill our dim hearts with light from God! THE MAIDEN OF POMPEII. “The flame, that wrapt my childhood's bowers, Revealed Thee to my darkened mind; Thee whom e'en sybils, seers and powers Of Night in Delphi's grove divined; With the dim glimpse of shadowed thought, They saw the Atoner's form of light, Yet pale doubt sighed o'er visions wrought, The idol world still walked in night. Now paymm dreams of dread no more, The feigned response, the magi's charms, O'erawe and on my spirit pour The torturer's spells, the tomb's alarms. On starlight wings, through blooming air, Hope unto heaven bears human love; Doubt, grief, lone tears, remorse, despair Haunt not the soul's own home above. My chill heart cheered by thoughts like these, Far from my ruined bowers I roam; Thy love lights up the midnight seas, Thy smile is earth's most heavenly home! THE OLD CHRISTIAN. “Dimmer, like hoary years that bring Life's winter, wanes the volcan's glare; Destruction furls his meteor wing, Watching the desert of despair! Now far before the æolian Isles Send up their vassal fires, but still, Where fair Trinacria's Hybla smiles, Darkness sits throned on ætna's hill. Soon, by Sicilia's whirlpool streight, Our barque shall seek the Ionian sea, And o'er blue Adria, pagan hate To Rhætian hills hunt not the free! The sun, with beams that bloom, shall soar, And vineyard, vale, hillside and grove, Sea, mountain, meadow, isle and shore Bask in voluptuous lights of love. Yet darker ruin must descend, Which man alone on man may rain, And locust king and harlot fiend With the heart's wrecks strew mount and plain. Away! the grave's wild shadows swim O'er my pale eve of autumn days; Away! the wild to harp and hymn Like sphere-voiced choirs, shall breathe, O Christ! Thy love and praise!” 'T is summer's tenderest twilight, and the woods Glow like an inner glory of the mind, And rills, veining the verdure, and among Vines, rose-lipp'd flowers and odorous shrubs in mirth And music dancing, purl from fountains known But to the gnomes and kobalds of the Alps— Mysterious springs, o'er which eternal night Watches and weeps in solitude, her tears Mingling, at last, with the green ocean deeps. Brightness and beauty, love and blessedness Breathe on each other's bosoms, while afar, From jagged cliffs the torrent cataract Hymns the Omnipotent; and from the brows Of desolate peaks ice-diademed, which thought Alone may climb, the mountain avalanche, Vast Ruin, falls and with it ruin bears. All else is loneliness, beauty and love, Peace and a hallowed stillness, and the souls Of the lone mountain dwellers, in the hush Of solitude and nature's majesty, Partake the sanctity and power around. The sunbow o'er precipitated floods— The ice-lakes, and ravines where chaos dwells And desolation; flowers beneath snow-hills, Where the great sun looks wan—the mightiest pines, Rooted in chasms, that o'er the unfathomed gorge Hang, wave and murmur—vales of paradise, That smile upon suspended horror—all With memories and oracles and dreams, Time's hopes, eternity's imaginings, Infinity's vast grandeur, the meek love Of birthplace home,—the boundlessness of power, The holiness of earth's reliance—fill The awed and yet exultant intellect! Flowered fields and harvests bloom around the door Of a lone forest cottage, and amidst The Eden of the wild a hoary head Is lifted and the wan lips move in prayer. Around, three beings kneel in thought o'erawed, Vesper responses breathing from high hearts, The ordeal of the paynim sternly proved— And Echo whispers in the clefted rocks. From meek adorings and communing love, Then rose they, not as worshippers arise In latter days of evil, with proud eyes And minds revenge corrodes, but violet-like, And gentle as the dawn breath of sweet May, Patient, serene and robed in holy thoughts. Dayspring and dewbeam, thus, year after year, Dawned and departed, and the seasons had Their own peculiar joys in Pansa's home. And there—the Roman Convert's testament— The storm-nursed heritors of Faith, blasphemed, Throned Liberty on Alpine pinnacles, And bade her temple be the Switzer hills. There in love worshipped, there with hoar hairs died The Christians, but the deathless spirit Rome Gave to her son, and Mariamne's heart, Bequeathed—in Freedom and God's holy Law, With tyrant Wrong warred through Guilt's thousand years.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">NOTES TO THE LAST NIGHT OF POMPEII. Note 1, p. 17.—The hoar Apennines: I have represented Mount Vesuvius throughout the poem as a portion of the Campanian hills. Note 2, p. 18.—Thou needest not thy tephilim— The prestiges of Augurs. Charms in Hebrew and pagan worship, the tricks of jugglers and imaginary protections against evil spirits and earthly calamities. Note 3, p. 25.—Cabiri. Mysterious demigods of Egypt and Samothrace. Note 4, p. 26.—The Ambracian waters were not deeper dyed. The battle of Actium, fought upon the Ambracian gulf, for ever decided the fate of Roman liberty. The glory of Octavius Cæsar rose from the blood of that fearful day, and most fearfully did it glow till barbarian retribution made Italy's charms a curse. Note 5, p. 27.—Diomede's apparitors. I have appropriated to the chief Ruler of Pompeii the name of its wealthiest citizen. It has been asserted, by some, that he was only a freedman, yet the Emperors seldom hesitated to confer their judicial or fiscal offices upon any who scrupled not to embrace the most oppressive means in the irresponsible administration of power. His character, therefore, as I have attempted to depict it, would synchronize with the condition of the age and the avowed crimes of Pompeii. Apparitors were officers of justice or injustice—bailiffs—so called from their suddenly appearing when undesired. Note 6, p. 33.—Judah's peerless monarch. Solomon. “Vanity of vanities! all is vanity.” Note 7, p. 42.—In worship to the dread Labarum. The Standard of the Roman Emperors Note 8, p. 49.—The story of his doom. Both the time and mode of St. Paul's martyrdom are problematical. The opinion is generally received that he died during the persecution of Nero, about ten years before the period of my story; but as chronologists differ and biographers cannot agree, I have assumed the right to narrate his death, in the person of Pansa, as in the text. Note 9, p. 54.—The Accursed field. The Campus Sceleratus, where vestal virgins were buried alive when they followed the example of Rhœa Sylvia. The Tarpeian Rock was not far removed from such appropriate neighborhood. Note 10, p. 54.—The aruspices in purple trabeæ walked. The prognosticators of Rome were allowed extraordinary honors; and their trabeæ or robes of office nearly resembled those of the Emperors. Every superstition exalts its expositors; and the Roman priests well knew the power which fear and ignorance conferred upon them, and abhorred in the same degree that they dreaded the illumination of Christianity. The fasces, the trabeæ, pretextæ, and curule chair were introduced by Tarquin Priscus from conquered Tuscany. Note 11, p. 56.—The Gracchi from the Aventine dragged forth. For attempting by the enactment of the Agrarian Law, to restrain the exorbitant power of the patricians, Tiberius Gracchus was assassinated in the Capitol by Scipio Nasica; Caius Gracchus and Fulvius Flaceus were killed by Opimius, the consul; Saturnmus the tribune was murdered by a mob of Conscript Fathers; and Livius Drusus, on the same account, was slain in his own house. All in Rome, who could not trace their descent from the highwayman Romulus or some one of his least merciful banditti, were esteemed no better than vassals. The Romans never understood either justice, mercy, or freedom; their dominion was acquired by the sword without remorse, and it perished by the sword without regret. Note 12, p. 59.—The isles shall wait, Jehovah! for thy law. I have made the dying ejaculations of St. Paul to consist mostly of portions of his own powerful writings. Nothing more beautiful or splendid can be found in any compositions—more vivid with the heart's best emotions and the mind's most lofty conceptions—than the remonstrances and arguments of the great Apostle, who devoted himself to the propagation of that religion he had once assailed, with an energy and enthusiasm and utter oblivion of self, which should find more imitators among the curates of men's souls. Note 13, p. 63.—Shalt quaff the massic or the tears of Christ. The wine of Mount Vesuvius is profanely called Lacrymæ Christi. Note 14, p. 65.—The Mamertine abysses. Dungeons even more horrible than those of Venitian and Austrian tyranny, dug immediately beneath the elevated seat of the Prætor, in the hall of judgment; and so called from the Roman consul Mamertinus, who planned their construction, and who should have been, like Phalaris and the inventor of the guillotine, the first to test the merit of his philanthropic ingenuity. Note 15, p. 70.—For they were stricken from the roll of men And banished from humanity. Probably among no people, not even the mercenary Africans themselves, who are always more ready to sell than the Christian trafficker is to buy, was the condition of slaves so utterly hopeless and irreclaimable as in the republics of Greece and Rome. Their vivid jealousy of personal privileges peculiarly fitted them to tyrannize over every people not incorporated within their chartered dominions. Nothing is so cruel as boasting philanthropy; nothing, so unjust as a dominant hierarchy; nothing, so capricious and despotic as an unrestrained democracy. Note 16, p. 71.— - - - - - - - gazed, Bewildered on the amphoræ— The priests of Pompeii were no believers in a preshadowed Mahommedan sobriety or the Genevan doctrine of total abstinence; but, rather, devout apostles of good fellowship, bonhommie and bienseance, whose credenda have lacked no devotees among the administrators of a very different religion. Their amphoræ or wine casks were always amply supplied by votaries who did not doubt that their spiritual guides possessed the same prerogatives in Tartarus which less remote exclusives in sanctity assume to exercise in Hades. The skeletons of many priests, on the excavation of Pompeii, were found amidst the relics of their revel. Can we suppose that even the ministers of a degraded superstition and a most lascivious mythology could trust in the protection of Jove or Osiris? or must we rather conclude that criminal appetite excluded natural fear and that they reasoned, like Pompey on his last journey—“It is necessary that we should be gluttons and revellers, but it is not necessary that we should live.”? Note 17, p. 75.— - - - - - - Untrimmed lamps Sculptured with shapes of ribaldry to lure. The sensualities of Pompeii were not restricted by any deference to decorum even in external dissembling; but the passions, which burned in their bosoms, were too graphically represented upon their customary utensils. The secret deposites of the Museum Borbonico at Naples will illustrate this to any who are incredulous of the noisome excess to which sin may be extended. Note 18, p. 77.—The Sybarite from Salmacis arose. Even in an age proverbial for its effeminacy and vice, the Sybarites were quoted as the acme of examples; and the waters of Salmacis, by some mysterious properties, were considered capable of restoring the frame, exhausted by profligacy, to its original vigor. No one who had broken an oath made by the Styx (which not even the gods dared to infringe) could be permitted to drink of Lethe or oblivion of the evils and sufferings which he had been doomed to bear for his crimes. Note 19, p. 78.— - - - - Now towered the gonfalon Of Isis, glowing with devices shame Shrunk to behold, the shapes of earth's worst sins. The pamylia and phallephoria. The character of the Romans under the emperors renders it unnecessary for me to create any reluctancy on their part to gaze upon objects, in public processions, which in other communities, would have never been imagined. Greece took her religion from Egypt—Rome her's from Greece—and both had public temples dedicated to the Aspasias, Galateas and Campaspes of the age. The pastophori or priests of Isis, therefore, felt themselves much at home in Pompeii. Note 20, p. 79.—The war god with the Ancilia. The sacred shields of Rome—borne in the processions of Mars, who of all the monstrous idols was the most worshipped because the least merciful. Is it not a singular anomaly of the human mind that in every creed the god of vengeance has always been the most opulent and popular? “By what casuistry can infinite punishments be reconciled with finite offence? or why should men be instructed to fear an endlessness of torment for sins ephemeral as their breath?” 39 Note 21, p. 80.—And we must drag them to the altar. Nothing could be more ominous of evil than any resistance or even reluctancy on the part of the victims to be sacrificed. That the offering might be auspicious it was necessary that the animal should seem to rejoice in its sacred death. Note 22, p. 86.—Obelia. A peculiar sort of sacrificial cakes.— It was held unholy to offer up any maimed or imperfect creature, and herein the Judean ecclesiastical enactments agreed with those of the Greeks and Romans. All their animal sacrifices were “chosen for beauty and young quickening life.” Any blemish inflicted by the Huntress or Pythias, by Sun or Moon namely, was deemed a particular offence to the deity. Note 23, p. 94.—And each Promethean divination brought. See Potter's Antiquities, Von Hammer &amp;c. for the various superstitious observances of the Greeks and Romans. In the scene of the sacrifice I have introduced evil omens—such as the Romans feared in their height of power—throughout the ceremonial. Note 24, p. 95.—Bore Pompeii's loveliest virgin. Human sacrifices were not uncommon during the earlier periods of the Greek and Roman history; and I cast no additional discredit upon the ancient character of heathenism by representing the disappointed consulters of the gods putting in action their cannibal ferocities. Iphigenia and Jeptha's daughter illustrate Grecian mythology and Jewish vows. Note 25, p. 96.—When has the bigot, whatsoe'er his crown.— I appeal to all history, civil, sacred, ecclesiastical and profane. Persecution is not exclusive; give preponderance to any sect or faction and it will tyrannize; the faggot would be lighted, the dungeon filled, the deathaxe red. The civil power would collude with the church as it has always done, when the latter claimed the prerogatives of heaven to exempt it from human accountability —because superstitious ignorance fears more the anathemas of a priesthood than the agonies and blood of a thousand victims. Representations of eternal punishments due to those who indulge humanity, by sparing the proscribed, the heretics, namely—have influenced mankind far more than the view of nations banished and provinces depopulated by the relentless malignity of some Torquemada of paynimrie or Christendom. Factions and sects, in politics and religion, never yet won any thing but ruin and disgrace, yet they are perpetuated and multiplied as the world wears to waste! Note 26, p. 96.—O'er the lava walks. The streets of Pompeii were paved with blocks of lava; and the audacious apathy, which they manifested amidst the threatenings of Vesuvius, may be ascribed to their familiarity with earthquakes and volcanoes. The wretched inhabitants of Portici, Torre del Greco and other exposed villages are, at this day, as unapprehensive of the peril that has overhung them since their birth, as were the Pompeiians at their death-hour. Cities buried in lava or ashes, may lie beneath even Herculaneum and Pompeii. Note 27, p. 97.—The music of the sistrum. A stringed instrument peculiar to the mysterious rites of Isis, which, like most other mysteries, concealed the most nefarious practices. Note 28, p. 101.—Holy Diana! hath thine Iris come. The rainbow, in every mythology, has been beautifully personified. Iris, its goddess, was the messenger of the ancient deities; and though employed by jealous Juno to create “green eyed monsters,” she was more happily occupied, in general, in separating virtuous souls from feeble frames and escorting them to Elysium. No one is ignorant of the Scandinavian bifrost, and the romantic tales of the Eddas. Note 29, p. 104.—Breathes not the soul of mystery in this? The whole art of uttering oracles consisted in choosing terms capable of any construction. The desires of the consulter determined the meaning; and neither Delphi nor Dodona could commit its credit by the failure of a prophecy which, it might allege, was never properly understood. No one can have forgotten the celebrated response (which illustrates the sophistries and follies of the ancients) “Aio te, æacide, Romanos vincere posse.” The maiden now consents to give an Isean response, prefiguring the ruin impending, from which all who escape, must fly by sea, that the absence of the priest may afford her an opportunity to shun his embraces. Note 30, p. 105.—The mocker Momus has his jest. Momus, the Jester of the gods, when Jupiter presented the man whom he had created to his inspection, and asked him how, characteristically, he could find fault with such workmanship, replied with a sneer that the defect was both obvious and incurable —that one so wise as the king of gods and men should have placed a mirror over his heart that all might discern evil purposes in their first conception. The priest, by filling with his person the aperture of the image, pleasantly deems himself the mirror that reveals and directs the minds of men. Note 31, p. 122.— - - The wanton canvass lived With Mycon's impure thought. All the ancient sculptors and painters, inimitable as they were in the execution of their conceptions, faithfully followed, perhaps led the blush-disowning taste of the times; and every banquet-hall and chamber exhibited indubitable testimonials of their uses.—Mycon, Xeuxis and Parrhasius, it is hardly necessary to say, were gifted and celebrated artists. Note 32, p. 123.—Or I may brand the theta on thy brow. The Greek letter (theta) was burned upon the foreheads of slaves as an indelible sign of proprietorship; hence they were called literati—a term strictly applicable to some less ancient and better conditioned persons than the captive barbarians of buried times. Note 33, p. 123.—The tintinnaculus may shame thy clink! The Prætor may, perhaps, be allowed a pun. Tintinnaculus may mean a public whipper—an inflicter of the bastinado—and a jingling rhymer; lashes and verses both may be melodious. Note 34, p. 127.—Hath the caduceus met the eye of day. The wand of Mercury was the sign of peace; the caduceus was, therefore, seldom out of the hand of the lord of larceny. Note 35, p. 128.—The tyrant raised his hundred banquet halls, Tritoli's stews and Baiae's palaces. The Cento Camarelle of Nero and Piscina Mirabile (wonderful fishpond) of Lucullus, even in ruins, are objects of amazement to less abominable despots of modern times. Baiae was the most voluptuous of all the voluptuous resorts of the Romans, and the baths of Tritoli were necessary to restore the patricians after Falernian excesses. Here Lucullus fed his fish on human flesh —here Cicero perished—by the permission of his friend Octavius. Note 36, p. 132.—A darker doom than his, &amp;c. Marius. Sylla died at Puteoli, as Herod afterwards perished, of a most loathsome disease and in the midst of debaucheries. Note 38, p. 134.—I see a hoary head o'ercrowned. The Pope—whose tiara was the very meteor of ruin. Note 39, p. 134.—Though thou with Epaphroditus shalt live, Empedocles and Barcochab in fame. Epaphroditus, to immortalize himself, set fire to the temple of Ephesian Diana on the night Macedonian Alexander was born; Empedocles, to persuade men he was a god, threw himself into Mount ætna, but the volcano cast out his slipper and betrayed him; Barcocnab, who called himself the Son of a Star, but whom his countrymen named the Son of a Lie, was one of the innumerable false prophets of that strange people—the Jews. Note 40, p. 135.—The Lectisternian banquet. The funeral festival—the last of earthly indulgencies. Note 41, p. 139.—The Attic Sage. Socrates. His execution was delayed on the occurrence of a sacred festival—the annual voyage to the Immortal Isle, where none were permitted to be born or to die. Superstition sported with the tortures of injustice and cruelty. Note 42, p. 145.—Gaze from the podium. What is now the orchestra—then, the envied place of power and privilege. Note 43, p. 146.—Mingle the fiats of philosophy. However the sages of antiquity condemned the cruel sports of their countrymen, they seldom hesitated to witness and thereby sanction the atrocities which were perpetrated in every amphitheatre. Like the bullfights of modern Spain, the gladiatorial contests (the death-struggle of the agonistes and athlete) always attracted the presence and enjoyment of the most learned, opulent and famed of the Romans. Note 44, p. 147.—Salute the ruthless Genius of the Games. Morituri te salutant (the dead salute thee) were the melancholy words of prophecy uttered by all condemned to fight in the arena. Note 45, p. 149.—Mutters Domitian and Locasta's cup. Titus is supposed to have been poisoned by his brother Domitian —who was himself finally assassinated. Locasta was the female fiend of Colchian drugs. Note 46, p. 150.—Andraste. The British goddess of retribution. Note 47, p. 151.—The Praesul. The vicar general of Roman mythology. Note 48, p. 153.—Like the great Pisan. Galileo. See Brewster's Life of that great and weak man. Note 49, p. 163.—And low the lion cowered. A scene somewhat like this is depicted in “The Vestal,” a little work published two or three years ago, and written by Dr. Gray of Boston. But while I am happy to acknowledge both the pleasure and benefit I have derived from that elegant story, I must be allowed to say that the causes of the lion's submission are unlike. He cowers at the feet of the aged Christian in that work, because he sees an old master; here, he is made to submit on the well-known principle familiar to naturalists, that during any great convulsion of nature, the most savage animals forget their common animosities, and that the lion will not attack a man who steadily fixes his eyes upon him.—Having formed the plan of the whole poem and finished a considerable portion of it previous to my first perusal of the “Tale of Pompeii,” I was unwilling to forego the scene I had conceived previous to even the knowledge of the publication of Dr. Gray; and, therefore, have ventured to tread upon ground which has been trod by Milman and Croly. Note 50, p. 174.—The voice of age. that is, of the aged Christian with whom Mariamne had taken refuge on her escape from the temple of Venus. Note 51, p. 174.—Tergeste. Trieste. Note 52, p. 179.—The hoar devoter of earth's diadems. The allusion throughout is to the Head of what was, for a long time, the Catholic Church; and even the very strictest disciple of papal supremacy must lament the desecration of almost unlimited power in the hands of many who better understood the law of might, the pageantries of the tournament, the forms of the duello, the shock of war and the dominion of the castle, than the edicts and ceremonies and devotions of the pontificate. The “Rock amid the ruins” alludes to Peter, the reputed founder of the bishopric of Rome—his Greek name means a rock.</field>
