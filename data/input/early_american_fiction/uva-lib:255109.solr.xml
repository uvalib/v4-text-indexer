      <field name="fulltext">THE SURF SKIFF, OR, THE HEROINE OF THE KENNEBEC. CHAPTER I. The Cliff and Fisher's Lot. The bold, iron-bound coast of Maine is indented with numerous romantic inlets that penetrate at greater or less distance from the sea; some of them expanding into capacious harbors where a fleet of the line could ride at anchor in safety, and others narrowing into creeks overhung by almost arching cliffs. The shores of these indentures of the coast are mostly formed of steep, bald cliffs, with scarcely a vestige of tree upon them; bleak, wild, desolate spurs of granite that for centuries have battled, unmoved, with the storms and billows. In one of these little rock-bound bays, one pleasant sunny afternoon in August, 1814, a small fisher's vessel was riding at anchor. There was not a breath of air to ruffle the bosom of the sheltered nook where she lay, though the blue surface of the ocean beyond the head-lands that shut it in, was gently moving under a light wind from the south-west. But the little bay lay as motionless as a mirror, reflecting with wonderful distinctness the rocky sides, the minutest shrub upon them, and the fishing craft itself inverted with every rope and spar like a painting. The bay in which the fishing-boat was reposing so peacefully, was seperated from, or rather was joined to, the sea by a narrow passage between two rocky headlands, about sixty feet high, that came sweeping round from the main like two embracing arms. The inlet thus enclosed was about half a mile in breadth, and from the sea to its farther shore not quite one mile. Of all the bays of that bay-abounding shore, this was the most romantic and secluded, combining the most perfect safety from the tempests of the ocean, with the closest contiguity to its deepest waters. The shores on this secluded spot, we have said, were on every side bold and rocky. There was, however, one remarkable exception; and this was a snow white, in the sunshine, silvery beach that for a quarter of a mile broke the savage character of the rocky boundary in the bight or curve of the bay, directly opposite to its narrow, tunnel-like entrance. This beach was as smooth as a floor of the purest marble, and at low tide was full a hundred yards broad—a beautiful pavement of sparkling sand that at noon-day dazzled the eye, and by moonlight, when the waves rippled upon its verge, was one of the most lovely features in the scenery. Not a stone, not a green weed, marred its purity. The eye, turning from the savage grandeur of the cliffs around, rested always upon this with relief and delight. Directly opposite this lovely beach, the fishing boat was at anchor, and about a cable's length from it. From the beach a path wound up the face of the rock to the upland. Over-hanging this path were two or three groups of pine and fir trees, dark and unfading in their perennial green. These were, with the exception of fine tall white pines that grew, conspicuous objects from every quarter, on the western headland close to its verge. On the eastern head there had doubtless been once a similar group, as a lofty scathed trunk, white and hoary, lifted itself from the cliff in lonely grandeur, a land mark for the fishermen far away at sea, as the sun beams lighted it up and made it shine like a column of steel. In the rear of this, stretching far inland, was a forest of low pines and other evergreen trees; but they were not visible from the level of the bay, and were only seen coming in from sea; or more nearly when the path which led from the beach was surmounted and the upland reached. The observer there would, however, see this side of the forest a lower secondary cliff, about twenty feet high, between the base of which and the cliff he had climbed, stretched a green level space, comprising several rods in length and breadth, and would be agreeably surprised and pleased to discover close against the receding cliff a neat fisherman's hut, half embowered in the foliage of wild vines, and over shadowed by green trees that bent protectingly down from the rocks above it. This dwelling from its seclusion, its native beauty, its commanding view of the bay beneath it, and of numerous bays and islands, and headlands, and the broad blue sea beyond—with its pleasant lawn and pathway to the beach, and the pretty beach itself—with the fishing vessel riding at anchor, as if inviting to an excursion down the bay; with all these advantages, so unexpectedly discovered and combined, it would have tempted the most world-loving to sigh for its possession as a haven and home of rest. The cottage, the situation of which we have thus described, was the abode of a fisherman; one of that large and useful class of men, who have given to Maine the proud appellation of `Nursery for the Navy.' Unlike the ordinary habitations of the poor fishermen, who dwelt along the iron coast of the eastern sea-board, this was, as we have seen, a picturesque abode. It was constructed of logs it is true, but they were smoothly hewn, and neatly fitted at the angles, so that when the walls were completed, they presented a smooth surface which, being whitened with lime, made from sea-shells, presented a pretty appearance. The roof, too, was unique. being entirely composed of a surface of large shells, cemented in line, and laid in rows over-lapping like the plates of scale armour. This arrangement combined both economy and ingenious taste, and showed that the occupant was a person of a superior order of mind, to those of his class. The house, which contained four rooms, was built against the second cliff, and directly beneath two trees that shot outward from its surface almost horizontally, and so covered it in a manner at once wild and sheltering. Above these trees, was a great dark crown of forest, the beginning of the vast inland wood already alluded to. The sides of the cliff bent round, so as to enclose the cottage on the north and east, and west sides, leaving it open to the south and the sea. This wall of cliff was not entirely bare. Some careful hand had trained over it, nearest the hut, the wild creeper of the Northern clime, so that it formed a beautiful feature to the eye. The same hand of taste had planted rose-bushes, the fragrant wild-rose of the rocks, about the door and underneath the windows; and also in groups on the lawn interspersed with young acacias and elm. Woodbine had also been taught to form leafy arches over the two humble windows and door, and to fall from the eves in graceful festoons. There was a dove-cote at one end of the cottage, and upon a tall pole near the eastern gable, was perched a little miniature light-house, perforated with arched windows, from which the chirruping and ever-active black-martin went in and out, enlivening the scene with their musical notes, and their motions through the air. There was also a lantern-shaped cage hanging at the door side, through the bars of which a glimpse could be got of the rich green coat of a Poll Parrot, even if his shrill voice in continually calling out, `How is the tide, my lads?' did not previously give warning of his presence. There was seated also, in the door step, on this sunny afternoon, on which we are bringing you, dear reader, to the house we are describing to you as you approach it, in the door-way a large, enormously large, and comfortable-looking black cat, nine years old, with a face as grave as a grandam's, and her paws and hide as sleek and soft as those of a young mouse. She sits purring in the warm sun, wrapped up in her dignity and com fort with all the consequential appearance of a privileged citizen. Not far from the old cat, which occasionally glances towards him out of the corner of her half-closed left eye, crouches a grand, noble-looking Newfoundlander, with his nose resting upon his pure white paws, large as a lion's. His colour is tawny, like that of a lion, and his hair about his majestic neck and head, long like that of the king of beasts, to whom this dog is only second, save in savage ferocity. But the small light hazel eye of the dog, the quiet thoughtful air of his brow, the gentle aspect of his whole physiognomy, show that his qualities are far from being savage; that though he may have the courage of the lion, he has the gentleness of the lamb. He seems to be asleep, as he lays himself half in the sun, half in the shade of a low myrtle bush; his eyelids from time to time slowly lift, as if he was on the alert with all his outward repose.— He had laid himself down in the full sunshine, but the sun in his journey has thrown his stately form half into the shadow, and soon promises to cast him completely into the shade. The old cat appears to be quietly watching this operation, and to be speculating with half an eye, upon the probability of Bonus's changing his position, as the shadow falls farther and farther upon his person; for though it was an August afternoon, it was near the close of the month, when on this coast, the sun-light is sought rather than shade. There is a small black and white cow, without horns, grazing upon the lawn, cropping the sweeter grass near the verge of the cliff, an ugly, ill-favored animal; but nevertheless in keeping with the place and scene. These are all the living objects about the cottage, save a poor solitary sparrow hopping upon the rocks, near the path that descends to the beach, and far away, in the deep blue of heaven, a hawk, or an eagle, balancing himself upon his spread pinions as immovable as if painted on the sky. About the cottage door are signs of the craft of the occupant. A dip net stands against the wall on one side, and a grapnel hangs by a peg on the other. Before the window, on the grass, is stretched a cast net, to dry in the warm sun-beams, and afterwards to undergo repairs, which rents here and there in the delicate tracery of cross lines shows that it will need ere it be used again to ensnare the hunted habitants of the deep. Against a tree, at the west end of the cabin, stand a pair of oars and a mast with a sail bound around it by the gasket, the blades of the oars being still damp, as if not long out of the water.— From the trunk of this tree to the limb of another was stretched a cord, knotted at regular intervals, with strands of twine pending from each knot. This was the commencement of a new net, and the balls of twine, a serving mallet, and marline-spike, near in a box, showed that the worker was not far distant, and had been recently at his task. The door of the cabin is open: it leads into a broad, high entry or hall, open to the very rafters of the roof; but a glance will tell us that this space was left for a given purpose, and not from want of thrift or time to cover the hall. Instead of a roof or ceiling, its place is supplied by a boat inverted, so as to form a sort of arched ceiling. This boat is of peculiar structure, very long, and narrow forward and aft, but broad in the beam. It is a light sea-green color on the outside, and pure white within; and in reality forms a very pretty and appropriate roof or canopy to the central apartment of the fisher's cottage. It is just the length of the entry, and in its centre exactly its breadth. It is suspended in the mid air by regular davits, and can be lowered in a moment's time, when, by being turned on its side, it can easily be passed out of doors. On each side are beckets, containing each two long slender oars, beautifully made, with white blades and green tips. The entry also contains, at its furthest extremity, festoons of dried fish, nets, paddles, oars, spars, boxes, and is altogether a general household storage room. There are doors on either hand, opening into small, but comfortable rooms, one of which is a kitchen, the other a bed-room. In the rear are two other rooms, one of which is a sort of boat-shop for repairing, and even building boats, and the other a ruder sleeping apartment than the former, which has a carpet woven of grass upon the floor, and snow-white curtains to the bed. There are glimpses of three or four pots of flowers in the window, though they looked as if they fared not too well in the hard sea-air of the cliff. See! there is a bee busily buzzing and stealing sweets out of one of the flowers, which shows that they are more healthy than we at first supposed. But the bee must have been a far traveller to wing his way to the sea-side to gather honey; but, peradventure, he well knoweth that May Fawn's flowers are like herself, when compared with other maidens, sweeter and fairer than all in the regions round about. And who is Mary Fawn? Mary Fawn is the fair flower of the cliff, whose presence has thrown such a fragrant beauty over all that we see. It is the lovely fingers, lovely and taper though browned with the sea-winds and the sun—of May Fawn that has taught the woodbine to cover the naked rock, as charity clotheth the poor. It is the busy hand of May Fawn that planted the wild rose-bush at the door, and trimmed the honeysuckle over the window. It is the taste of May Fawn that has converted this bleak sea-cliff, with its acre of open ground, into a green and tempting paradise. If thou seest any beauty in it at all, it is because it first existed inherent in the pure soul of May Fawn. The beautiful and picturesque, which you behold, are but emanations from her own tasteful self. She has one of those souls which creates every where, out of the material, its own image. The affection of May Fawn led her to build a cote for the dove, and a tower for the martin. Her affection gathered to her bosom the old cat to love, and to embrace, in her benevolence, the noble dog Bonus. May Fawn was stamped upon every thing around. The spirit of Mary Fawn filled all with its own beauty. CHAPTER II. “Poor Tom of the Cliff.” At the moment we have introduced the reader to the Fisher's ocean-cot with all its picturesque beauties, there was no human being visible to give it life and character. There was, indeed, the old black cat, the parrot, the Newfoundland dog, and the hornless, short-tailed cow, the doves, and the martins, and the bee busy at one of the flowers in the window; and all these lent life and variety to the scene. But the presence and voice of man, the prince over all things on earth, and without whose presence, though `sin doth follow him as his shadow,' all would be barren, desolate, without meaning or end, were wanting to complete the scene. The deep quiet and sunny silence which we have described, continued for a little time without interruption. Suddenly Bonus, the tawny old Newfoundlander, began to prick up his small, shapely ears, and gently turn his head as if to listen. A footstep strikes his ear, but very faintly. His eye looks lively and interested, and an expression of pleasure lights up his fine countenance. The foot-fall becomes more distinct, and comes from the direction of the rocky boundary that overhangs the cottage in the rear. The dog now lifts his head and looks eagerly, still listening with the peculiar air of his race; and now he very slightly moves his shaggy tail. The steps come nigher and more fully marked to the ear. The cat, Kate, now purrs loudly and moves her long whiskers in a sort of gratified manner. The Poll Parrot utters a shrill whistle, and calls loudly and noisily, `Kate, how's the weather?' The martins chirp and fly in eccentric and more joyous circles about the roof, and even the ugly, black, spotted cow lifts her head and gazes for an instant in the direction of the cliff. There is now in full sight, slowly descending a flight of rude steps, formed partly by art, but mainly by nature, a young girl dressed in a brown-coloured calico, and with a large, broad-brimmed, grass hat upon her head, shading features most beautiful, as we can see they are at this distance. As she comes down the rocks and advances to the house, coming round to the front, she moves with a free, graceful step, and an air at once modest and independent, as if unconscious of observation and felt unrestrained. Her figure is slight but finely moulded, and expressive of the purest health, to which the rich peach hue of her nut-brown cheek bears testimony. Her eyes are large, expansive and expressive of much feeling while they are animated with intelligence and sweetness of character. A smile of the most charming character plays about her mouth, and she is singing from very lightness of heart and absence of care: `As slow our ship her foamy track Against the wind was cleaving, Her trembling pennant still looked back To that dear spot 'twas leaving; So loath we part from all we love From all the links that bind us; So turn our hearts as on we rove, To those we've left behind us. And when in other climes we meet, Some isle, or vale enchanting, Where all looks flow'ry, wild and sweet And all but love is wanting; We think how great had been our bliss, If Heaven had but assigned us, To live and die in scenes like this With those we've left behind us.' She sings like a nightingale, and her voice is rich and mellow, and full of feeling. The cliffs take it up and repeat it as if they would prolong the sweet sounds. `But why should I sing,' said she in a subdued tone, as if reproaching herself. `I ought to be sad and silent till I know the fate of those I love. I sing without thought; my heart is not in the idle songs, they are on the sea! the sea, which, all so beautiful and calmly blue as it is, may be a grave to those dear to me. I will sing no more. `Pretty May,' cried the parrot as she made her appearance in front of the cottage, and stood near his cage, leaning upon a staff which she had taken to support her steps in descending the rocks, upon which she had been, for the last half hour, standing and earnestly watching the ocean, now scanning its faint hue on the horizon to the east, now surveying the island outline of the vast prospect on the west, and now endeavoring to pierce the infinite open sea that stretched away to the southward. `Poor Poll!' responded the maiden, looking up at her green-coated friend. `you look as if you wished your master.' `Poor Poll!' responded the bird in the same sad tone in which she spoke. The old cat now rose up, and stretching at her full length, walked slowly towards her; and, after walking once around her, rubbed her glossy hide against her feet, which were as bare as ever an Indian girl's, and as brown almost; and of the most exquisite shape. They were without doubt or question the prettiest little pair of feet in the world. The hand too was the fellow of the feet; small, taper, and faultlessly designed, from the bared elbow to the rosy nails. One could see now, as she stood by the cottage door, how darkly beautiful were her eyes; how rich the rosy blush upon her cheek that mocked the most artful carnation of the toilet: how abundant and softly flowing in a mass of shining waves was her raven hair; how deep, and transparently clear, the scarlet ripeness of her charming lips; how long the dark fringe of lashes that shaded the fire of her eyes; and how altogether lovely, and without compare, was this maiden of the cliff. The Newfoundlander now rose, and shaking his huge form, walked towards her, with the majestic, friendly carriage peculiar to his race. His hazel eye beamed upon her with a protecting complacency, and looking up into her face, he wagged his huge tail, and then raising his clean white paw, laid it affectionately in her hand. `Good Bonus!' she said kindly, as she patted his large head. `You feel as lonely as I do without your master. Even old Kate here can't bear to be left alone. She understands that something is wrong; that my father is not always so long away. How they rejoice, poor things, when they see me return even after a few minutes absence, as if they feared I should leave them, too, with no one but poor Tom; and they know as well as any one that Tom is witless.' `Who calls Tommy?' said a shrill, crackled voice, from a shady covert, where a few myrtle bushes grew near a large fragment of rock that lay upon the ground at the end of the cottage. The sound of the voice was very extraordinary, as if compounded of the hoarse, base voice of a man, and the sharp tenor of a small boy. It had a complaining, impatient key, too, as if natural to it. `You may well ask who calls Tom,' answered the young girl, with a smile on her lip, and a slight frown upon her brow, as she raised her finger and shook it at a short, square built human figure, with high shoulders, and a large head sunk between them to the ears. He was about four feet and a half in height, and full twenty one years of age. His legs were very short, and his arms so long that he could take things from the ground with very little stooping. His head, which was enormously large for his dwarfish stature, was crowned with coarse yellow hair, that grew long, and thick, and bushy, like a mop over his brow, which was square and projecting. His eye-brows were as black as jet, and strikingly contrasted his hair and complexion, the latter being white and sandy; and his eyes were also small, and of a whitey blue tint. His features otherwise were not only good, but decidedly handsome. His nose and mouth and chin were elegant and manly counterparts of those of the maiden, to which they bore a marked likeness. But here the resemblance ceased, a resemblance physical rather than intellectual; for the features, which she animated with soul and feeling, on his face were characterised only by the sottish and unmeaning expression of folly and imbecility. There was no mind in them. As she said, even the dog and cat could tell that poor Tom was witless. He was dressed in a common fisherman's duck trowsers, shortened at the knee, leaving the leg bare below; in a linsey-woolsey jacket, and a woollen shirt of faded yellow flannel. His head was surmounted by a red cap, in which was stuck a piece of evergreen as an ornament; and around his neck and upon his wrists were strings of small, beautiful sea-shells, mingled with coral, and a perforated penny or two, worn bright with the fingers, which were constantly playing with them. He held in his hand a bunch of twine and a large wooden needle used in netmaking. The expression of his features, as he saw the maiden, was that of mingled affection and fear. `Ah, Tom,' she said in a kindly tone, `I fear you will never get the net done if you are so idle. You no sooner see me go away than you go off and lay down to sleep. An't you quite ashamed to be so lazy!' `Tom very tired,' answered the idiot. `If one would let you, you would sleep under the trees from sunrise to sunset, Tom. You don't have to work very hard. Come, finish your task!' The dwarf approached the cord which was stretched between the two trees and began, with an idolence of movement that was amusing, to attach a strand to one of the knots, while he kept his eye over one shoulder upon the young girl who stood near, watching him. `Sister May!' at length said the dwarf turning round and fixing his large lustrous eyes upon her; `where is father? Is he dead?' The face of the young girl grew suddenly pale, and she answered quickly, `Nay, I pray not, Tom!' `Why don't he come home, then?— The sun has set nine times since he went away! I'm tired bein' alone here. I'd rather father 'd be here, if he does beat me; coz I'm afraid?' `Afraid of what?' `Of devils, May.' `There are none here,' answered the maiden, shuddering in spite of herself, and yet smiling. `You can't see 'em, coz you are good, May; and they don't come round the good foik. But if you was as ugly and bad as I am, you'd see 'em plenty!' `You are not bad, Tom. You are only —' `Only a half-grown monster. That is it, May,' said the dwarf, turning round and speaking with an energy and vehemence she had never before witnessed in him; for his general manner was inert and lethargic. `Who told you you were a monster?' she asked, with amazement. `Who? If you had been in my head last night when I was sleeping, you wouldn't ask that! I saw him plain as I see Bonus there!' `Saw who?' `The old 'un, May. He came and danced round me, now stannin' right up on his tail, and on his head whirling round like a top, and then he'd come aclose to me and make mouths, and jabber and grin and say, `Tommy, how do you do? You are a nice person, Tommy—a brave man, Tommy, with your head between your shoulders, and a back like a whale. You are a monster, Tommy, and no body loves you.' `You were dreaming, brother,' said May, trying to laugh off the unpleasant feeling which his words occasioned.— `I love you if no body else does!' she added, taking his huge hairy hand in her's, and patting his shaggy forehead with affection. `Don't mind such dreams, Tommy! You are good, and sister May loves you!' `If you love me I don't care for the devil, coz you can keep him off! He's afraid of you. He knows you are good, and if you will love me, I'll not be afraid of him any more!' `That is brave, Tom! Now go to your task, for you know you are happier when you are at work. CHAPTER III. The Dwarf. The dwarf, who had betrayed in his brief conversation more feeling in reference to his deformity than he usually exhibited, kissed the fair hand of his sister with affectionate awe, and began to apply himself to his task. The maiden stood looking at him for a few moments with painful interest. He had never but once before, many years ago, alluded to his deformed shape, and then with a sort of idiotic wonder on seeing the reflection of his person in the water by the side of her own. He then expressed astonishment and surprise that he was so hideous and she so lovely: but it was unaccompanied by any manifestation of emotion. It was simply idiotic wonder. His habitual insensibility to his condition was the only solace her affectionate and warm heart received from the contemplation of his revolting personal appearance. She felt thankful that he was deficient in that intelligence which would render his life miserable at the full realization of his physical degradation among men. He was her brother—her only brother, and as he was always kind to her, and seemed to worship her and look up to her as to a superior being, she felt for him a strong and sacred attachment. She felt that it was her duty to love him whom all men hated and cast off. Even his father treated him with neglect and severity, bringing him up rather as a slave than a son. But poor Tom always found a shelter from the world's harshness in e sympathy of his noble sister. She was like an angel given to guard him.— His attachment to her was like that of a dog for its master; he was always faithful to her, and in her service was bold and active. He would have sacrificed his life to serve her. Between him and his unloving father she had always interposed and saved him from many a blow. Poor Tom! All gratitude and all feeling were not quite extinguished in his bosom. May was all the world to him, and all the future. He had vague ideas of Heaven, and he peopled it with angels, all like his sister May. To contemplate his dependent affection and watchful devotion, and her protecting tenderness and gentle sympathy, was a spectacle of the most touching and beautiful character.— The helplessness of poor Tom called into exercise all the benevolent and holier attributes of the generous sister's heart, and made her a lovelier character than perhaps she would have been; for we all need external objects to develope our internal qualities. Without the poor and wretched, charity and pity could not live in the human bosom. The kindness of May, also, drew forth from the darkness of Tom's soul the half-trained sensibilities and scarcely-formed affections which lay there, and which otherwise had never manifested themselves; thus keeping his soul for ever locked up in the hideous prison of his body. Her influence subdued the savage ferocity which at times, under the harsh treatment of his father, showed itself to be a native element of his character; and out of a ferocious brute she gradually cultivated a grateful, faithful monitor. May had, however, but little sympathy herself from her dark-souled brother.— He could not enter into her sorrows, or understand her griefs. He could not converse. He had no ideas to give or interchange. His existence was comprised, not in thought, but in feeling. He had a heart, for May had unfolded its affections towards herself; but he had no head. He could talk only in the accents of affection, or else in the bitter complaints of hatred against his father and all those who mocked at his deformity; for there are persons to whom misfortune is not sacred. May needed sympathy at this time.— She felt the want of some one to talk with. Bonus seemed to understand when she was unhappy quicker than her brother, and to manifest a lively interest in her. He now drew near her, seeing her stand with a sad face gazing vacantly upon the sea, and, looking up into her face with his soft, intelligent eyes, seemed to ask her what he should do for her. She saw him, and patting him upon the head, said, `Poor Bonus! You can do nothing to help me! You nor Tom can enter into my unhappiness. Yet I know you miss your master, and are sorrowful that he comes not; for though he never loved my poor brother, he has always loved you!' `Yes, father loves Bonus. Tom hate Bonus,' said the idiot with a scowl, as he clenched his enormous hand and shook it morosely in the dog's face. Bonus remained immoveable, calmly eyeing him. He knew as well as any human being did, that poor Tom was not a responsible person. He now seemed to regard him with dignified commisseration. `You should not hate Bonus! He is faithful and has twice saved your life!' said May, with gentle severity of reproof. `Yes, Tom love Bonus. Bonus good dog! He never call Tom, `Hunchy' and `Devil's child!' Tom love Bonus and hate father!' Here the idiot unclenched his hand and, with a face full of kindly emotion, patted Bonus on the neck. The sensible animal slightly wagged his tail and licked the palm of his hand with devotion, as if he loved Tom because, May, his mistress loved him. `I wish, Bonus, you were a bird—an Eagle—that you might fly and bring me news of my dear father!' said May, earnestly as she once more cast her eyes along the horizon of the sea. `I hope father'll never come back,' said the idiot, with emphasis. `Tom get no more beating.' `You are selfish, Tom! You are wicked to say so.' `Yes, the devil told Tom he was wicked,' answered the dwarf, with a countenance of fear and grief. `He say Tom you are wicked and when you die I shall have you! I told him May said I was good. Now you say Tom is wicked.' Here he began to give vent to a flood of tears, and it was some moments before she could pacify him. `You are good, Tom. I am sorry you dream so. It is because you sleep so much!' `I dream more about the old 'un when I'm wake, May. He comes and talks with me when I'm makin' the net. He stands one side and I the other, and always asks me to let him knot a strand. But I know if I do he will make the net to catch me in it, and so I threw the servin'-mallet at his head and he goes off bIowin' like a porpus.' `You should'nt think about him and you wont see him. There, go to work at your task, and I will by and by give you a nice supper. You know if you don't finish the net by the time father returns he will be angry with you.' `But he darn't touch Tom while you are by.' `But its better to get it done and not make him angry. It is nine days since he went, and you have not yet done five hours work on it; and he said he should be absent but three and would expect to find it done when he returned.' `I hope the fishes have got him,' said the dwarf, with savage vindictiveness. `Sail ho! Sail ho! How's the weather? Stir your stumps you infernal dwarf! What luck I say? Sail ho! Pretty Poll! Pretty May! Work you rascal Tom!' `I'll kill him. He's the devil, May! I hate him! He always abuses me just as father does.' No, Tom, for my sake hurt him not!' said the maiden, for the hundredth time being compelled to interpose to save her favorite from the rage of her brother. `He does'nt know what he says.' `Don't he? Is he fool-mad like poor Tom?' asked the idiot, with wondering inquisitiveness. `Yes, brother.' `Then Tom won't kill him!' was his answer, his countenance at once resuming its former inanity. `Poll has spoken truly!' cried May, with sudden animation. `Look, brother Tom! Is not that a white sail off in the south-east?' `Sail ho! Sail ho! It's goin' to blow like blazes! Tom you idle dog! Work! Work! Work! Sail ho, I say!' screamed the parrot from the cage. `I don't see it, May. But Poll knows. She has sharp eyes. Tom can't see half the time.' `Yes, Poll is right!' cried the maiden, joyfully. `It must be father's smack!' `I hope the wind in yonder cloud, May, 'll blow till it sink him if it is. I don't want nobody but you and I, and Bonus to live here!' The young girl was too deeply interested in watching the distant sail, for sail it was which had been discovered by the parrot from his perch, to heed his words. She hastened rapidly to the verge of the cliff where the path commenced descending to the beach below. Here upon a naked rock, that projected over the path-way, she stood, with Bonus by her side, and gazed eagerly off upon the ocean. with her two hands hollowed into a focus, she looked long and eagerly; while the dog, following the direction of her eyes, seemed to be quite as interested in the white speck on the horizon as herself. He wagged his tail, and he appeared to anticipate the arrival of his long absent master. Tom remained to go on with his task which he diligently pursued from fear of his father's blows, when he should come home, and find the net unfinished. The young girl watched the sail until she was satisfied that it approached nearer and nearer. Her face, on this discovery, expressed her joy; and she began to congratulate Bonus on soon seeing his master. For an instant, to relieve her eyes, pained by steadily fixing them upon the distant vessel, she dropped them to the bay immediately below her, where cradled upon its calm bosom, lay at anchor the little mackerel-boat we have already described. She could look down directly upon its deck. The sight of it suggested the idea of going out to meet her father. `If there were a breath of air in the bay, I would go down and embark in the boat with Tom, and sail out to meet him. But though there is a fresh breeze outside all is as calm as a lake in the harbour. I must check my impatience, and await his slow approach. But I am disappointed! It is not my father!' she cried with surprise and grief, as a slight change made in the course of the vessel displayed three masts, and the rig of a ship. Till this discovery, the vessel had been standing directly towards her, so that she presented only one mast; from her great distance. May could not tell the shape of the sails; and it might be taken for her father's shallop-sloop. But she now saw that what she supposed was a small vessel, comparatively, very near her, was a large ship half below the horizon, her upper sails only visible. It was a great disappointment to her; for she was most tenderly attached to her father, who, in his turn, idolized her for her beauty and goodness. Her influence over him had been extraordinary, for he was a man of violent passions, and a stern, cold character; and although she grieved that he hated his dwarfed child as he did, she exerted all her power to shield him from his anger and endeavor to turn his heart towards him. For her sake he had withheld many a blow which would have well nigh slain poor Tom, and her sweet voice had stilled a thousand feelings in his bosom. Her love rendered her blind to her father's faults, save this, his hatred of her brother; and this did not make her love him less, but her brother more. How could she see evil in a father who never breathed an unkind word to her, who never looked upon her face but with admiring tenderness? How could she judge him bad who to her was good! How could he, who so loved her, be wicked! Yet there were dark tales abroad about her father. They had even been whispered with malice in her ears; but they were not heeded. She shut her ears to the words that fell on them, and would never suffer them to rest a moment in her mind. Nine days before, as we have said, the old Fisherman Northrop, had sailed from the little secluded bay on a trip, as he said, to Portland, to buy articles needed in his profession, especially salt; and also to lift his bounty money. He had sailed in a small sloop of ninety tons, which he used as his fishing vessel, for a few months past, his swallow-tailed schooner having been wrecked a few months before in coming into the bay in a storm, by being driven upon a ledge, directly off its entrance, about a mile distant from the scathed pine on the promontory. The trip over to Portland and back did not wholly occupy more than two or three days; and, as the wind and weather had been favorable almost every day since his departure, and he still stayed away, May, who was left alone with her brother on the cliff, began to entertain apprehensions for his safety; and these fears had increased with each day's absence, after the fourth passed without bringing him. He had taken in the sloop with him an old man and two of his boys, who lived on an island about a league distant towards the mouth of the Kennebec, who, from their poverty, having no vessel of their own, usually embarked their fortunes with him, and composed his crew whenever he went on a fishing cruise. CHAPTER IV. The Little Cloud. The sail which had so disappointed the young girl, by displaying the majestic outline of a ship, instead of proving to be the little fishing sloop, now gradually lifted above the horizon-line, and showed her masts down to her deck, May was sufficiently skilled, fisher's daughter as she was, to see that she was a very large ship, and that her sails had that square, heavy look characteristic of a man-of-war; for she had seen, during the existing war, more than one English and American frigate sail past the harbor; and could distinguish them from the more frequent and less imposing merchant vessels, even at three leagues off. The course of the strange sail had been, when first seen by her, direct for the cliff; but she had shortly after hauled her wind and now seemed to be stretching away eastward and a little northwardly. May continued to watch her until she could plainly discern the whole of her dark hull. She strained her eyes to see if she could distinguish the black and white squares of ports; but the distance was too great. She also strove to make out the nation of the colours which she saw flying over her stern. `It is no doubt an English war-ship,' she said with a disappointed air. `Ah, Bonus, your master comes not. I fear that he may have fallen into the hand of the enemy; though they have never yet harmed fishermen. My poor father!— What can have become of him. If by to-morrow morning he does not return,' she said anxiously, `I will take Tom with me and sail over to Portland in search of him! The ship has altered her course again! She is now standing directly in for the bay! No; I see the reason of this seeming change. The wind has suddenly gone down, and so she is becalmed; her bow has swung round and points this way. Not a breath ruffles the ocean, which but a moment ago was rippled like the back of a mackerel! How calm the air is even here upon this eminence!' The ship had indeed became stationery; the light wind which a few moments before had been wafting her along at the rate of four miles an hour having suddenly died away, leaving the surface of the sea as polished and smooth as if an ocean of molten steel. The sun, which was within an hour and a half of its going down, reflected from the water with dazzling splendor. `A ship, May!' said the shrill voice of the dwarf close to her shoulder. `A warship!' `Left your work again, Tom!' `I'ant afraid o'father now. It ant the sloop, but a reg'lar war-ship. I can see the big guns sticking out.' `You have better eyes than I have, Tommy. I know that it must be a frigate, but I can't see that she has ports at this distance. She is full six miles off.' `I see 'em,' answered the dwarf, fixing his large bright eye upon the vessel.— `See that smoke and fire!' `A flash!' cried May with surprise. `And a loud gun too, May,' he cried, as the deep boom of a heavy cannon reached their ears, while the frigate was half hidden for a minute in a cloud of blue smoke that slowly rolled away to the south-wind upon the sea. `They wants a pilot!' said Tom with emphasis. `They cannot want one for this little bay; and they can have no object in coming in here. Besides, if they had a pilot, they could not move without wind, Tom.' `Wind! There 'll be enough o' that as soon as they'll want it,' he answered very positively, and pointed to the south-westward. `What makes you think there will be wind, brother? I hope there will be; for unless there is, father will not reach home to-night!' `I hope that he 'll never pass the scathed pine there agen, sister May!' he said doggedly. `I almost believe you would murder your father, Tom, if you dared!' `No, no. I wouldn't kill him. That would be wicked, May, and the devil would have Tom then sure enough. But if the winds and blue waves drown him, Tom wouldn't be to blame!' `I am sorry you hate him so, Tom! I shall not love you.' `He beats me, and calls me a wolf and a bear, May.' `He will beat you no more, Tom. He promised me that.' `He wont when you are by; but when you are out o' sight, he half kill Tom.' `Well, I wont be out of sight, brother! See, there is another gun.' How loud it sounds. It is bigger than, thunder, May.' `I wonder what they can be firing at,' she said, with surprise visible upon her earnest face, as she watched the distant stranger. `There 'll be firing and flashin' from this a-way too, afore long, May,' said Tom, pointing again to the west, where a small bluish clay coloured cloud was suspended low upon the horizon. It was not larger than three breadths of the sun, near which its position was. The sun, moreover, began to show a faint halo of mist, and to redden as it descended in its course towards the horizon. `That cloud, May, 'll grow faster than a mushroom if you'll just watch it. It is born right out of the sun, and the sun 'll feed it with its light, and fill it with lightenin', and the winds will fill it up with thunder.— That's where all the wind's gone to now.' `There is no doubt the cloud enlarges, and the sun looks angry, Tom, though I don't agree with you exactly as to the way the cloud is made up.' `Afore sun-down, the west 'll be half covered over with that little blue speck. It is a reg'lar storm-breeder.' May knew that her brother's knowledge in such matters, was better than her own; for he had little else to do but to study the sky and the sea, which for hours he would gaze upon in silence, seated upon the cliff, or posted upon some limb which overhung the surges. A storm excited in him the wildest joy; while, also, he seemed to have a heart for the softer features of nature, and to delight in beauty as well as riot in sublimity. She knew that his judgment was to be taken in all matters touching the weather; that even her father relied upon him in such cases, more than upon his own experience. `If there is to be a blow, I hope the frigate will get an offing before it comes on,' said May. `You do, May. Well, I don't; if she is an Englisher, I hope she'll go to the bottom. I don't wish good to the enemy.' `You should not bear such hatred, Tom. I shall not love you, if you feel so. The truly generous spirit cannot recognise enemies in the hour when danger 2 menaces them. How rapidly that cloud enlarges and changes its shape.' `Yes, it looks now just like a great black eagle flying over the sea.' `It looks menacing, and more so now that the sun has cast over its northern skirt a lurid red. The sun, too, looks fiercer every moment. Still, how calm lies the ocean every where around, as if in slumber. There is something fearful in witnessing this silent gathering of the tempest. There is another gun from the frigate.' `Do you want to know what them guns be fired for, May?' asked Tom, with a bright, covert light in his eyes. `I cannot conceive, unless it is for a pilot.' `They see the storm-breeder as well as we. They are becalmed, as you see, and know that it is a dangerous coast to be on in a gale. The storm is coming up from the south and west, and that 'll make a lee-shore for 'em; so they'll have to run for some harbour or go to pieces. They want a pilot to come aboard to help 'em to get in safe somewhere, when the storm begins to pipe. Tom's a dwarf and a fool, and every body hates Tom, but you, May; but Tom knows the war-ship is 'fraid o' the gale, and wants a pilot. They'd take Tom, if he is a fool.' Here the poor idiot laughed and chuckled, as if triumphantly anticipating his power to save the vessel, foolish as he was, if he were on board of her; for there was not a better pilot on the coast than poor Tom. He knew every shoal and rock, every sunken reef and dangerous place as familiarly as the palms of his two hands. `Do you think they feel that they are in such peril, Tom?' she asked earnestly. `How many noble and brave souls there are, doubtless, on board that ship! It would be dreadful if she should be lost.' `Hear that gun again, May! They are minnit guns, and minnit guns is al'ays fired when war-ships is in trouble. They wants a pilot, in case the storm should come and catch 'em among the herrin' ledges. They be in the worst place they could be put into. If father's sloop was there, I'd be sure she'd be wracked, if he didn't know how to pilot her into the bay!' `That cloud is advancing up the sky, and darkening all the west with fearful rapidity.' `In less than half an hour we shall see rare sport, May.' `You seem to have no human feeling at times, Tom,' she said angrily. `If it would please you to see that ship in peril, it would not please me.' `Don't frown on poor Tom. Tom love the war-ship, if May love it!' he said deprecatingly. `If sister May be mad at Tom, Tom wish to die.' `Then do not show such malice, brother. That ship, as you say, may be in peril. There is plainly going to be a heavy blow from the south-west. The cloud has already darkened the face of the sun, and casts a shadow like midnight beneath upon the sea. There they fire again. It is evident that they think themselves in a dangerous position, and are calling for aid from some one of the fishermen. Something must be done.' `If father was here, he'd go out to 'em and stay on board till the storm was over. `He'd run her safe in here.' `And why can't you, dear brother?' she cried with an eloquent expression of entreaty. `Me? You ask poor Tom to go and save a big war-ship? Tom's a dwarf! They'd hang Tom on the yard-arm soon as he come on board. They'd throw Tom into the sea to make the waves be still! Oh, no! Tom stay 'shore!' `There is no one but ONE that could save that ship from her danger!' she said, her cheek suddenly brightening its roseate hue: `but I fear that he would deem it his duty to let her perish—to leave her to her fate. What my brother says is true; they might fear to trust him; and he might, in the malicious caprice of the moment, wilfully wreck what I should send him to save. He is not to be trusted. There is no alternative. The effort must be made. His LOVE for me shall now be tested. They still live in hopes some one will aid them, and each solemn report of the guns, indicates their sense of the danger of their condition. What I do I must do quickly.' The danger in which the frigate was placed, was indeed, very imminent.— She had become becalmed in a sort of bight of the main-land, with a low point running out to the east-ward which, if the wind of the storm should come out of the south and west as it was threatening to do, could not be weathered. She was, as the sailors phrase it, land-locked.— Her distance from the shore in a direct line was about four miles, and from the place from which the young girl and dwarf were watching her, five miles in an east by south direction. The coast was rocky and forbidding, and off the land at various distances, were several sunken ledges, intermingled here and there with a sharp, black rock, looking like a huge fish lying upon the smooth surface. The fishing bay, we have described at the commencement of our story, was the nighest shelter for the ship; but as several ridges of sunken rocks indicated a dangerous entrance, its passage would not be attempted by a large ship, without a pilot. The ocean was perfectly breezeless; lying in profound repose, as if awaiting the coming storm. This was advancing up the sky with appalling blackness. Half the heavens were covered with a bluish black canopy, its upper edges curling along the blue expanse in ashy white fringes, streaming out straight before the winds of the upper air. The blackness of darkness lay upon the sea beneath. Solitary upon the wide ocean, hung as if in silent terror, the noble ship; its sails snugly furled, save two storm-stay-sails; and at ra pid intervals came from her the loud voice of her artillery, calling for human aid. CHAPTER V. The Young Fisher. The young maiden who had suddenly formed, as we have seen, some resolution in her mind to do something for the safety of the endangered ship, left the verge of the cliff where she had been standing, and began rapidly to descend the path-way to the water. `Follow me, Tom,' she cried, as she darted towards the beach. `Where are you going, May?' cried the dwarf, as he bounded after her. `Tell me what you want of Tom.' `I want you to go with me and pull the skiff. I am going to George Hunnewell's.' `Georgy has got a broken arm, May.' `Do I not know that, Tom?' she answered as she bounded lightly into a small skiff which was fastened to a stake, which belonged to, and was used to go to and from the little craft at anchor a few yards off the beach. `Yes, you ought to know it, for you cried when father told you how he'd been dashed against a rock when the fishing-schooner was wracked, and so smashed it. What are you going over to see Georgy for? Didn't you tell him, for I heard you, when he was last here, that you could never love him? But I knows it was because he had said something about father you didn't like. Touch father, and its touch May.' `I can't talk with you now,' answered he maiden, blushing. `I am going to see George. I want you to row me there.' `That I'll do, sister May, because Georgy like me. He never calls me dwarf. He loves you too, for he always talks about you, and said if he could make you love him he should be the happiest fisherman in all the coast. Why don't you love him, May?' `Don't ask foolish questions, Tom.— Take your oars. There: cast off. Now pull hard and strong. We have not a moment to lose.' `But I'm afraid that storm 'll come up before we get there.' `Not if you pull hard,' she answered, as she shoved off the skiff with a boat-hook, and turned it prow down the bay. Tom, without saying a word, and accustomed implicitly to obey his sister, immediately sat down, and taking his oars, placed them in the row-locks, and began to bend his broad back vigorously to his task. May sat in the stern with a paddle, guiding the boat on her course. `You are not going straight across, May?' `Straight across, Tom,' she answered with a resolute air. `If the storm meets us we are gone to bottom.' `It wont meet us,` she responded, glancing at the tempest-cloud, which was already flinging out its ashy banners from the edge of the black mass, far across the zenith. `By the way it has been coming on for the last half hour, it will be full half an hour before it bursts. It is but a mile and a half to George's cabin.' `I begin to guess something.' `What?' `That you'll be going out to the frigate.' `No, I am not.' `Well, if you was, I wouldn't row another pull, if you should beat me with the boat-hook. No, no! Tom is a fool; but Tom loves May too well to let her drown in the black waves.' `I am going only to George's. Pull! Do not delay!' `Then I'll pull, and hard too,' he answered, as he once more bent to the oars. The little skiff seemed to be cutting its way across the surface of a sea of ink —so black was the reflection of the sky upon it. Its wake lay like the the whitest snow far astern. It shot across the bay like an arrow, and approaching the base of the cliff-head, on which stood the tall, scathed, white pine, looking like a spirit of the storm, with its arms outstretched, beckoning on and marshalling the hosts of the tempest. `That old white tree looks like a monstrous live woman, May. How it glistens!' `It is because the clouds are so dark which it is relieved against. It has a terrific appearance in this murky gloom.— But heed it not. Pull hard and strong till you get round the rock, and then we shall have but a short distance to go to reach George's. The skiff passed out of the entrance to the enclosed bay and going round the promontory of the Scathed Pine, where the under-sea billows began already to swell in anticipation of the wild surges that promised soon to lash the deep, opened upon a shallow inlet half shut in by a ledge and reef, upon which the swell had begun to rise and break into white caps, though there was no wind upon the ocean, and a fearful stillness reigned in the heavens, which were in fierce and rapid motion from the south west. As soon as the two adventurous occupants of the skiff had got out of the bay and pulled round the head of the cliff, they entered the lesser bay; and, after passing inside of the reef that nearly barred entrance to it, they came in sight of two fishermen's huts, nestled in a rocky nook close to the shore. Their situation was wild and romantic. Not a green tree, not a vestige of soil or sward was in their vicinity. As the skiff rapidly approached the shore, a rocky natural stair was visible by which it could be reached from the cove; and at the foot of the stair were two skiffs, one containing a mast and sail; the other was drawn up a little ways upon a flat rock which was covered with sea-weed. There was a short distance to the left of the landing the wreck of a vessel of sixty tons, nearly stripped to its ribs, and over-grown with richen and barnacles. A net was dragging upon the rocks; and upon the end of a spar which projected from a crevice in the cliff over the water, about six six feet above it, sat an old woman in coarse apparel, bare feet and arms, with grey locks falling wildly over her brow and about her brawny shoulders. She was smoking a short pipe, and engaged in repairing an old sail with a seaman's thimble lashed upon her palm. Her features were sunburned, harsh and repulsive. She seemed to have an habitually savage aspect, as if she loved no one, but rather hated all of her kind.— She had been keenly watching the approach of the skiff since it first hove in sight around the spur of the promontory, at intervals muttering to herself: `That fool, Tom Northrop and his cream-faced sister! I wish the storm would come up with 'em. What do they want coming here? No good, I'll warrant me. She is a witch and no better; for she has bewitched my boy. He is good for nothing now since he was last over to their place; and does nothing but talk of May Fawn! I'll send her back ere she shall see him!' She would then take a few stitches in her old sail, and then as her small grey eyes wandered over the sea, they would fall on the frigate, about four miles distant, which continued still to fire her signal guns. `Ah, fire away, Englishmen. There is no harm done to any of us by such kind o' powder-burnin'. You find yourself in a bright o' the land and know that when the wind begins to make the sea up you'll have to run in under the land, or go upon the rocks. There's no getting to windward with the tide flowing and the wind, as it is like to be dead agen ye! — How that strong-backed dwarf pulls an oar. He makes the skiff dance along as if it was alive! I wonder what they want here! I hope George 'll not get home afore they 've got what they want and are back where they came from. There is lightning, and sharp, too!' The appearance of the heavens now was truly terrific. The cloud which an hour ago had been no bigger than `a man's hand,' had expanded till it covered two thirds of the sky; and was still rolling eastward to envelope in its inky veil the strip of horizon where still was visible the deep blue expanse. The shadow upon the sea was like night-fall; and from its gloom appeared the frigate with its two white strips of canvass shining almost with phosphorescent brightness. The shades of the sea were lighted up by the light of the continual cannonade from her deck, while the deep peal of the report resounding among the cliffs of the main, awakened feelings of solemn awe in the mind not only of May Fawn as she sat at her little helm, guiding the bark in which she had so adventurously launched, but also in that of a young fisherman who had been for some moments watching the frigate from an opening in the cliff, not far from the two huts we have seen perched mid-way the precipice. He was about two and twenty years of age, of good height, and finely moulded person. His complexion was clear and somewhat pale, as if from illness; but his eye had lost none of its fire, nor the expression of his face any of its native decision. Altogether, his countenance was handsome, and singularly prepossessing. He was dressed in grey trousers, fisher's half-boots, and a sort of woollen blue frock, without button or button hole, secured to his waist by a leathern belt. His brown locks were covered by an old straw hat, turned back from the brow with a bold air. He wore his left arm in a sling, and upon his rightshoulder, he carried a rusty, well-worn gun, at the extremity of which dangled a bunch of snipes and sand-birds. He had been out upon the beach for the last two hours shooting, as an old fisherman who lived in a neighbouring hut, had recommended bird's-flesh for wounded persons, in preference to fish, the usual sustenance of those in health, who dwelt on that coast. The young fisherman, had therefore, taken his gun and gone out to shoot his own supper, about three hours before sun-set. He had walked slowly and stopped often, as his wounded arm still kept him weak; and although two months had elapsed since he crushed it in being wrecked in Old Northrop's shallop, it had not yet healed. Had not the birds been very plenty and very tame, he would hardly have been able to take any game; but as he could rest his gun upon the shoulder of an old negro who accompanied him, and fire among flocks of them, he was thus enabled, though with but one arm in use, to do considerable execution. He was about a mile from his cabin up the coast, when he heard the first gun fired by the frigate. He was a little ways back from the shore, when the report reached his ears; and he hastened to the sea-side to learn its cause. He saw the frigate laying, becalmed, directly opposite the place where he stood. At first he did not understand the object of the signals; but on turning his head westward, he beheld the expanding cloud, and the storm haze that was veiling the sun's disc. A few seconds observation showed him at once the perilous position of the ship, and he was at no loss to conjecture the cause of the guns. `Buttermilk,' he said, addressing the negro, who was looking over his shoulder. `Massa Jorge,' responded the black, who was a fat, oily, paunch-bellied African Falstaff, who looked as if he had lived on train-oil and turtles all his life. `That frigate is English.' `Yiss. I know dat widout him color; but I see him color 'stinctly.' `I see it now flash out broadly red. It is English, and therefore, an enemy.— Do you see his danger when it begins to blow?' `If he don't walk out o' dat afore dat storm walk up, he'll hab to walk down to Davy Jones. Dem's my pinion, mass Jorge!' `He would, no doubt, be glad enough to get out of the place he is in. He is fairly embarged. But he cant move a fathom till the storm strikes him, and then it is sure to drive him on the rocks, unless he has a pilot who knows the coast well.' `Pr'aps he hab, massa Jorge,' remarked Mr. Buttermilk, rubbing his grey wool on the top of his forehead where he had, by this habit, nearly rubbed a bald spot as big as a dollar. `Then what is this firing for? He is making signals for a pilot to come off to him; for he well knows he will want one ere long.' `Dere no pilot in dese parts, massa Jorge,' said Buttermilk, looking as if wondering at the idea; `dere no big city here for 'em pilot to sail a ship in.' `He don't expect a regular pilot, Buttermilk; he is firing in hopes some of we fishermen will go out to him.' `Vah, yaw! I see 'em now. Him spose he get some ob us, eh? I guess he hab to pay! Spose we go and pull out to him, massa Jorge, and ax him.— Praps he gib you plenty money to pilot him into Nortorop's bay.' `Do you think me a traitor to my country, 'milk?' cried the young man, with flashing eyes. `No, no. If Providence aid our cause by wrecking a powerful ship of the enemy, so be it. I shall not save it from its fate! Come, let us homeward. They now moved along the shore, sometimes by a path winding inland round evergreen woods, and othertimes close to the pebbly shore. At length they came once more upon a commanding eminence, where the young man stopped both to rest, and to admire the sublimity of the gathering tempest; its effect increased by the regular firing every minute of the ship's cannon. CHAPTER VI. The Dwarf and his Sister. The young man stood admiring the ocean with its dark pall of clouds, the frigate reposing upon its bosom reflecting the light from the east, which was becoming fiercely red, and listening with something like awe to the heavy discharges of the artillery as they were borne over the waveless sea, and to the answering thunder in the west, which now began to mutter with terrific fore-boding. The bosom of the dark-cloud was momently riven by arrowy shafts of lightning that shot athwart the murky vault, or rendered dazzling by chains of fire extending from the zenith to the sea beneath. `We shall have the storm bursting upon us in all its fury ere long, 'milk,' said George Hunnewell, as he turned from the spot to hasten along the edge of the dizzy cliff towards his abode. `You see dat skiff down dere, massa Jorge!' asked the negro, as he paused on a shelf of the rock to wipe from his shining forehead the drops of oily sweat that oozed from the pores of his skin, and to take breath; for Mr. Buttermilk was not much of a walker. `Yes,' said the young man, `I see it now! It contains a female, certainly!' `Yes, dat am plain to be seen widout a spy-glass, massa Jorge. And don't you know who dat am rowin'? It de dwarf Tom!' `You are right, and that must be May!' he cried, with joyful surprise. `What can bring her here to see—no ot to see me! She wouldn't take that trouble. She would sooner go from me. I hope she comes with no ill news of her father.` `Dere be no news ob old Northrop but what 'll ebber be ill,' answered the negro. `Come, massa Jorge, whar you runnin' so fast! You break you neck down dem rock, and den you' arm nebber get well, sure! I nebber can run dat way! Its nuff for dis nigger to walk. Legs is good for nothin' in dis here blessed world but to go up rattlins wid, and hold on to foot ropes aloft wid. I nebber seed any oder use for em since I was born'd ob my fader and moder. Dey ony makes a man tired as walks on em ashore, and sweats him like a fried porpus. I wish massa Jorge arm get well so we go fishin' agen in de smack, coz I nebber live if I don't die runnin' about on de shore. Dere, he out ob sight like a herrin' divin' under a haddock's belly.' The old negro, who had lived on the salt-sea all his days, and had grown lazy and fat on idleness and good humor of late years, now followed at a slow and laborious gait his younger companion, for George was the companion not `master' of Buttermilk. Our hero had recognized the graceful form of May Fawn in the skiff and bounded away to meet her at the landing. As he went he wondered at her coming; for a few days before he had been coldly received by her, when he told her with all the warmth of manly devotedness that he loved her better than life and hoped that she would promise one day to become his wife. As he descended the path, he passed the upper of the two cabins, in the door of which sat an old blind fisherman with a head as white as snow, busy at work mending his nets. `Ho, who is it?' he inquired, as George came down the path rattling the stones into the water beneath. `It is me,—George:' answered the young man, without stopping. `You, is it? You have cured your arm in a hurry, youngster! Not two hours ago you went past up the cliff creeping along like a sick crab, and Buttermilk after you like a snail with his shell on his back. What is that I hear—thunder or cannon?' `Both, uncle,' answered the young man, as he went on. He now came to the door of the hut below, which was his own. It stood on a shelf of the rock, with hardly room about it to spread a net to the sun.— It was twenty feet from the landing where the boats were secured, and communicated with it by a rude stair way of loose rocks. Here he paused behind the angle of the house to recover breath and to collect his thoughts while he watched, unseen, the scene just below him. There was the skiff stopping within five rods of the landing, and in it was standing the beautiful girl who made him the most miserably unhappy person in the world, yet whom he would have died to do a service. She was talking with the old woman, who was seated on the spar below the hut; and who, having dropped the end of the sail she had been patching, was gesticulating, and loudly talking to her, while in her right hand she brandished an old harpoon. `I tell you, you old hell-wizzard of a wdarf, if you pull another stroke nearer, I'll send this ere harpoon straight through your crooked back. I'd just as leef do it as drive it into a porpoise.' `Say the word, May, and I'll row right in and take the old witch, and fling her into the sea,' cried Tom, whose rage was aroused by her epithets and menaces. `Jist say I may, sis.' `No, no, Tom. I fear she would do as she says,' answered the young girl firmly. `Mild measures are the best. Ma'm Hunnewell, I do not wish to land if you will let me say a word to George.' `Yes, George,' she shrieked with fury, `I'll wager it's George you're after. You have so bewitched and bebothered him so that he don't know a shad from a pollock, or me from the devil.' `That's a true word, May. Let me tell her aloud she is the devil's dam.' `Hist, Tom,' said May, `we must not anger her, if possible to prevent it. Keep quiet, and do only as I bid you. `Good Marm Hunnewell, if you will tell George I wish to speak with him a moment, I will make you a present of the old gray and white cat you once said you would like to have.' `Will ye now?' cried the old hag, her face all at once lighted up with hideous delight. `Then if ye'll bring me the cat afore to-morrow morning ye shall speak with George. But he aint to home now. He's gone out to shoot snipe; for they say snipe's meat is good for broken bones. He has been a sort o' going backward the last week. He'd been better, it's my opinion, if he kept away from Northrop's bay. So you'll give me the old cat, will ye,' she screamed in a high key. `Yes, as soon as Tom can go and return with it.' `That's a darter!' she answered, rising and looking up the cliff, as if in search of her son. At this moment George made his appearance almost by her side before he was discovered. `May, how glad I am to see you!' he cried with animation lighting up his fine face. `I never expected to see you come here voluntarily. Something I fear has happened. No ill news from your father, I hope?' `No, no; old Northrop will never come to any other end than a rope's end;' growled his mother. `He that's born to be hanged will never be drowned. Keep a straight path before your own face and eyes, Miss May, or you may be no better than your forefathers. What's bred in the bone will show itself in the flesh.' `George,' said the young girl, in a low tone, as the youth descended close to the water-side, `get into the boat there, and paddle out to me. I wish to speak with you.' `Speak it out and never fear, girl,' cried the old beldame. `No charming with your snake-whisperings, my boy. He has had enough o' that. He hasn't the soul of a spider left in him since you have been practicing your charms upon him, poor boy. Stay where you are, George.' The young mand did not heed her, but springing into a whale-boat that was fastened to the rock, he cast off the painter, and shot the boat by a strong push out to where her skiff lay, about thirty feet from the shore. As he came along side she extended her hand in a frank, friendly way to him. He grasped it with emotion and joy, colouring to the temples with pleased surprise at this reception. `How good and kind you are, May,' he said, with a delighted look. `I have come to see you, George, to ask you to do me a favor, or rather—not me but—' Say it is for you, dearest May, that I may have the happiness of doing something for you to show my—my—love for you.' `Perhaps you will deny that the favor is for me, but rather for humauity, when you shall know what I have to ask of you.' `No matter what it is you wish, I will do it for you, May. `Do you see this storm that is over-hanging land and occan, and gathering its power to a head?' she cried pointing to the gloomy heavens, and sullen and motionless sea. `Yes: and I am glad that you have reached here as you have done. It was rash in you to have set out at such a time, dear May. `I have came on an errand of mercy! You behold the tempest advancing like an armed host, and you know the tremendous power of storms such as this promises to be on this coast. Tell me can any vessel live in it, that is caught near the land?' `No, unless they sought shelter in one of the harbours.' `Do you see yonder stately ship of war hanging mid-way as it were between heaven and ocean, as if a foot-ball for them to sport with and crush when they shall ere long meet in their fury?' `I have been watching it from the cliff, May. I have heard the firing from her for some time.' `And do you know why they are making these signals?' she asked earnestly, looking her lover full in the eyes. `Yes, for a pilot to come off to them!' `Then you think they will need a pilot!' `Need one! If they have none, they are sure to be driven upon the land!' `And can you speak of and contemplate such an appalling catastrophe, George Hunnewell, and not feel a desire to prevent it! Can you look on with indifference when it is in your power to save her from the fate which inevitably awaits her. The signals can be for no other purpose than to call for the aid of some fishermen to pilot them into some harbour as soon as the storm sets them in motion. To my ears it has all the pathos of a human voice. I cannot hear it unmoved. Hark! how its deep voice thunders among the cliffs. Its cry is, `Aid us! Send us help! or we are ost!' `I have felt for them, May! I have not listened with indifference; but do you know that that ship is an enemy! I could distinctly see that the flag of England waved over her stern!' `And are not Englishmen fellow-beings. Would you quietly see that ship go to pieces and hurl into the engulphing surges five hundred souls!' `They are our foes, May. That ship has been armed, manned, and fitted out in England, to war against our land, burn our cities, and lay waste our coasts. If a ship of my own country meets her, she will seek to destroy her with powder and ball; and if she plunges down ints the depths of the ocean, with every living being on board, it would be a matter of rejoicing in the land; and the conqueror would be proclaimed with the trumpet of fame as a hero. Now, here the ship is exposed to peril by being becalmed in this side of Cape Small Point. It is certain that, without a pilot, she will be lost on the reefs; for it will be impossible, after the wind strikes her, for her to gain an offing. This she is sensible of, for hear how constantly her guns are booming for assistance. Now, painful as it would be to me to see this vessel wrecked, I feel that, as an American, I cannot wish any one to go to her aid, and I sincerely trust that no fisherman, in the hope of a large reward, will be so lost to his patriotism as to answer her signals and go to her relief.' `Is this your serious opinion, George Hunnewell?' said May, her face as pale as marble, and her lips trembling with emotion. `Yes, May.' `Then has my errand hither been fruitless,' she answered, with deep depression in her sad, beautiful face. `Come, brother Tom, we may go again. Farewell, George! The time is too precious for me to linger, when humanity calls for my aid.' `May! What? Where do you go? Do not leave me thus,' he cried, seeing her skiff receding rapidly from that in which he stood. `Where are you going? You cannot reach home at this time. The storm will be upon us in a few minutes.' `I can reach the frigate!' she exclaimed promptly. `Reach the frigate! Are you mad? You will be lost!' he cried with wild alarm. `I shall perish in a noble cause,' was her noble response. `Tom you must row me to the frigate,' she said with decision. `Do you mean to pilot her, May?' he asked with hesitation as he stopped rowing after having pulled about two boats' lengths from the skiff in which George was standing. `No. But you must pilot her into Northrop Bay, brother. I shall stand by the wheel with you to see you do your duty faithfully. The frigate shall not be lost while there is safety at hand.' CHAPTER VII. The Lover. Every word that the spirited and humane girl uttered was distinctly heard by the young fisherman. He seized the oars of his boat and was in a moment by her side. `May, you are mad! Do not think of doing any thing to aid this vessel. Aside from her being an enemy, who if saved to-day, might destroy Bath to-morrow, it is impossible for Tom to reach her in time.' `Do not say one word to dissuade me, George,' she said earnestly. `There is no time for words. The lives of five hundred men or more, may hang upon a moment. Once more, I ask, will you try and reach the endangered ship and pilot her in safely, when the storm bursts upon her?' `May, I can do nothing for my arm.' He answered, wishing, if possible to throw obstacles in the way of her wishes. `You can take Tom with you. He will row you on board. You need not stand to the helm yourself when on board, save to direct the seamen how to steer. George, it would be a heavy crime in you and I to leave that vessel to her fate!' `I do not know, dearest May, but that it might be considered a crime in the eyes of my country to save her!' `I see you will do nothing! I see that ou love me not, George, with all your protestations. I did well to meet your professions coldly. Pull strong and well, brother; we must reach the frigate and save her if we can! They are no longer to be considered as our enemies, whom Providence has cast upon our mercy and love for the safety of their lives! Good by, George, I hope that your country will reward your inactivity; and if the frigate be lost, crown you a hero, as much as if you had destroyed the ship in battle. Not another moment's delay. The tempest is nearly upon us. Bend to your oars, brother! Five hundred lives depend upon your strong arms and willing heart!' `I'd do this for you, sister May; because I love you; answered the dwarf; `but I know you'll love me more if I'll go by myself! Just get into George's boat and I'll go alone; and I will be honest, and pilot the ship in, because you want to save it!' May hesitated a moment. She well knew the fickleness of her brother's disposition. She feared to trust him. `No, Tom,' she replied, shaking her head, `I will go with you.' `Dearest May!' cried George Hunnewell, coming up after the flying skiff, and holding by the gun-wale; `will nothing alter your determination?' `No, George. Release the boat!' she cried with decision. `This is no time for words!' `May,' he said, drawing his boat up along side and taking her by the hand; `you shall not take my place in this enterprize. I have told you my objections, on the score of leaving a dangerous enemy to his fate. I have pleaded my wounded arm. I have pleaded the danger to be incurred in trying to gain the ship! But I see that you are resolute to go. Believe me that my heart is humane; and that, were that ship wrecked I would risk a hundred lives did I have them to save her crew from a watery grave. But, I question very much whether I ought to try and save them from the wreck which will be their fate unless they receive aid! You have accused me but now, and said that I loved you not; and that you did well to return coldly my professions. I will go to the frigate. I wish to show you that I love you, even before my love for my country. I waive every objection, every opinion adverse to your own, and for your sake will do what I can to save the frigate. If I am lost before I reach her, remember me with kindness, and forget not that I lost my life in proving to you my devoted attachment. If I live and save the ship I cannot, do not hope that my success will be rewarded by what would compensate for every risk,—your love.' `George, if you save this ship,' answered May with deep, earnest emotion, `my hand is yours.' `Then welcome the tempest and the danger!' he cried springing into the skiff. `From this moment, dearest May, I enter into this with the same heartiness that you do. For your sake I will save that ship or perish with its crew!' `I do not think of danger to you, dearest George, for I know your skill and courage. There is yet time to gain the frigate. The flood-tide has gradually lifted her landward, till she is now not more than two or three miles off. Do not be too venturous, for recollect that your life is very dear to me.' `Is it possible that I hear such words from your lips?' `Do not delay. Tom you will pull George out to the frigate.' `No; I will go alone.' `Your arm!' `I feel no weakness in it. The consciousness that I am beloved makes me a new man.' `Tom shall go with you.' `No, I won't,' answered the dwarf. `I mean to stay by with May. Who'll she have to row her home? No, no. Master George can go if he likes alone. It's one thing to pull for sister May, and another to row Master George.' `I shall go alone,' answered George Hunnewell. `No. There is Buttermilk calling to you, George,' said May. `He will go with you. You cannot row the boat alone.' `I had forgotten him. Good bye, dearest May. Pull in shore, Tom, and land there, and remain until the storm is over. I will just row in and take 'Milk in, and then be off.' The two boats now turned back to the landing, which was about a hundred yards distant, and the young fisherman, without a word of explanation to the negro, ordered him to get into the boat and pull him out to the frigate, while deeper and louder rolled the answering thunder over-head. `It's a hard pull, massa George; but you gib nigger half de money dey pays you for pilotin'.' `Whatever money is paid shall be yours,' answered George. `I don't go for money.' And as he said this he looked into May's eyes, which returned a kind glance that inspired him to the task before him. `You had best pilot her into our bay, George,' said the maiden, as the negro grasped the oars and her lover seated himself at the helm after pressing her hand in farewell, for he did not know he should ever see her again, the duty he ad entered upon being full of danger. `Yes, I will do so, if I can. At any rate, if I reach her, I will run her into one of the bays near here. Remain here with my mother.' `No, I shall try and get back before the gale commences, as I left the house open; and all will be ruined if I am away.' `You had best not try to double the headland, but land and cross the cliff and so go on foot, May.' `I will take the best and safest course, George. Now, God bless you and make you instrumental in saving the ship and the lives of all.' `For your sake I will do all man can do,' he answered as he waved his hand to her. The next moment the sinewy armed African was sending the little bark swiftly over the bay in the direction of the open ocean, where the ship lay motionless, about two and a half miles distant. May followed in George's boat, for he had taken the skiff as faster and lighter, giving Tom orders to keep close in with the shore and row rapidly; for, near as the storm seemed, she hoped to reach the cove before it came upon her. It was not without feelings of sadness—anxiety that she watched her lover as he receded from her eye in the direction of the frigate. It seemed as if to embark at such a moment, in so frail a bark, when a mighty ship could not face the gathering storm, were tempting fate. She could not see him departing without emotion; for, though she had treated George with coyness and coldness, as if from a spirit of maidenly waywardness, she was really and sincerely attached to him; and when she promised him her hand as the reward of his efforts to save the ship, it was no very painful sacrifice of herself. But much as she loved him she felt that she ought not to be so selfish as to think of his danger, while by his daring a whole ship's crew might escape a watery grave. She felt that if she were not willing to give him up for such an effort, she was unworthy of a brave man's love. Her heart swelled with emotion as she gazed on the threatening heavens, lowering and over-hanging the sea, as if ready to fall with the weight of suspended waters. She felt that if he did not reach the ship before the wind began to plough up the depth of the sea, he would perish. `But rather let him, dear as he is to me, rather let him perish in the effort to save so many lives in jeopardy,' said the noble girl with tears rushing to her eyes, `than that they should perish without an effort being made to save them. If he had not gone, I would have gone! Keep farther out or you will hardly pass that rock, brother,' she said to the dwarf, as they glided swiftly along the shore. Upon the cliff far behind them stood the tall, wildlooking figure of Dame Hunnewell, calling now after May, in fierce threatenings for sending her son away by her charms to meet certain death; and now shrieking his name, and with extended arms, calling upon him to return.' He heeded not her cry, his spirit nerved to the task before him by his love for May. The maiden, as she followed him, with her moist eyes, felt that it was for her love he was venturing thus, and he rose in her esteem for his courage and devotion. `The boy is mad as a crazed ell-wive,' cried his mother, mounting the rocks till she came and stood where the old man, her uncle, was seated, calmly mending his nets; using his fingers for eyes. His quiet and repose of countenance and manner contrasted remarkably with the excitement of the woman's manner. He could not see the foreboding blackness of the heavens, or hear distinctly the muttering thunder and the deep-mouthed cannon. `What is the matter?' he asked petulantly. `Matter, John? That girl May Fawn has been here again, and bewitched the boy. He is as mad as he can be. She has charmed him. He would try to walk on the sea if she bade him.' This was shricked into his dull ear, in a key shrill and loud, like the scream of an eagle. `What has she done?' `Done? She has sent the foolish boy out in a skiff to try and reach the British frigate that is in the offin'; and as it's dead calm and a dreadful storm comin' she'll go to Davy Jones's without she get's a pilot; and she has been firin' for one this hour.' `Yes, I've heard the guns. An Englisher, you say? How near Cape Small Point is she?' `About two miles this side, and inside of it; and the storm is coming from the southward right smack down upon her.' `Then she's on the reef of bald rock afore midnight. Has any o' the fishermen gone out to help her?' `Didn't I just say that Northrop's girl, the young witch as she is, has been here, and made George go out to the frigate. He wouldn't have gone if he could have helped it: but she fascinated him like, and so he went.' `They'll pay him handsomely for it, if he pilots the ship in.' `Handsome? I don't want money for my boy's life. He never'll reach the frigate in this world. There he goes, poor boy, and Ben to row him, right out into the open sea. He's a mile away now, and the devil was never so ugly as the sky and sea looks; though the sea is as still as death.' `The boy will get gold, if he gets there The English are rich,' answered the ava ricious old fisherman. `I would ha' done the same in my young days. We risked our lives every time we put to sea, woman, for money. Let the boy go, so that he gets well-paid for it.' `But it is an enemy's ship.' `Gold is gold if it be an enemy's. I say let the boy go.' `I'll take the life of the girl if harm comes to him,' answered the old woman clenching her fists, and exulting in this contemplated vengeance, if her son should be lost. `Stand here and tell me how things go?' said the old man. `What has become of the girl.' `There she is in George's boat (for he has got her's) and that dwarf of a brother of her's, hugging the scathed pine head, and trying to double it before the storm reaches them. I pray that they may be sunk. But she'll get home safe, for all my prayers; for she has a charmed life. She is in league with evil spirits and charmers; and that is the way she has bewitched the boy. That was lightning. It seemed to hiss in the sea, Hark! the very rocks tremble at the awful thunder!' CHAPTER VIII. The March of the Storm. The crisis of the time was now drawing near. The heavens were enveloped in black from the west, where the small clay-coloured cloud first appeared an hour and a half before, to the east, where for the last ten minutes a streak of red sky had seemed to contend with the moving clouds for a place above the horizon. The sun, though long invisible, was just about setting; but the darkness of twilight had been some time covering the bcean. From the cliff where the old woman stood, nothing was visible but the gloomy presence and advancing power of the tempest. Night seemed suddenly descending upon land and sea like a curtain let fall. The sky was not simply a black mass, but was streaked with angry looking wreaths of a pale phosphorescent colour, that curled and shot outward with wild movements. The whole bosom of the sky seemed to be in a state of the wildest agitation. It tossed and heaved like an inverted ocean lashed by the winds. In the west and south the thunder rolled, and arrowy lightnings shot athwart the arching heavens in terrific splendor. All beneath the rolling and echoing sky was motionless. Not a breath stirred the leaves of the herb that clung to the rock, or sighed through the heavy branches of the immovable pine. The agle and the hawk had sought their eyries upon the cliffs or thunder-splinted pine, where they sat in silence and fear, watching the coming of the storm. Even the snowy-winged gull ceased to wheel about the cliff-head in swift and graceful flight, and darting into the crevices of the over-hanging rocks disappeared from sight. A shadow of singular gloom lay upon the land and sea. And the sea itself lay motionless beneath the wildly driven storm-sky. Its surface was unruffled by a zephyr. It looked like molten steel, only darker from the reflection of the clouds that seemed to hang in some places within a few hundred feet of its surface. Upon its broad bosom but two objects were visible; the frigate, and the little skiff half way from the land to it. The boat containing May and the dwarf, had already doubled the head-land back into Northrop's bay and were out of sight. The old woman stood by the hut looking earnestly after the boat containing her son. At intervals she would make a brief reply to a question put to her by the blind old man, who had dropped his net, and turning his sightless eyes towards the ocean, seemed to be trying to comprehend the situation of things. `Hark, what noise is that?' he said, his anxiety quickening his hearing, even more than hers; for her thoughts and eyes were upon the little skiff, and heedless of all else. `It is the under-swell of the storm, moaning up from aneath the sea. The storm has struck the ocean not many leagues away and will soon be here. Oh, my poor boy!' she cried, clasping her hands. `You will ne'er reach that foul ship in time. Accursed be the witch who sent thee to thy death; for hadst thou not been fascinated thou would'st never have thus risked thy life.' `Do you see any signs of the wind on the ocean yet?' `No, not yet. All is smooth and black as night!' she answered, after casting her eyes in the direction of the south-west. `He is but little more than half-way now. See how small-like a black spec it looks to be. May the God of the sea keep him is an old mother's prayer!' `I think I hear the ship's guns.' `No. It is the booming of the undertow as it swells up against the shore, forced along by the tempest ere it has reached us. The billows begin to roll and swell, and heave like mad. List! Did you hear that roar? It was a huge wave rising suddenly over Fox ledge and breaking bodily upon it in masses of snow!' `We shall soon have it then. These sou-west storms al'ays show their teeth first on the Foxes. Look away to windward and see if Porpus rock is white!' `As a snow-drift!' she answered, emphatically. `Then it wont be long afore it'll be down upon us. I'd better go in and shut up all snug.' `I shall not move. I shall watch the boat my boy is in, so long as I can strain my eyes upon it, or see it above water. It goes on fast, and nears the frigate.' `How is the frigate's head? N. by East.' `What sail has she set?' `She has only two three-cornered, jib like looking sails spread between her masts, and her jib set reefed; with her spanker also close-reefed. All else is taken in.' `Her master is a wise seaman. He knows just how to meet the storm. If there was only room for him to lay his course, he might get an offing as soon as he feels the wind. But if Cape Small Point is east of him and stretching south of him, he'll have to lay to, or make a harbour. And it takes a good pilot to get into one o' our harbours in fair weather, much less in a storm like that I can hear howling.' `It is the surges coming in, in great rollers, and dashing upon the beach, that you hear,' answered the woman. `If you would escape the tempest, get in with you speedily. I shall watch the boat.' The old man got up, and feeling his way by the wall of the cabin, entered it, and sat down within the door; and so near it, that he could at any momen close it. She remained standing upon the rock, her gaze bent piercingly upon the little spec, scarcely vislble, that indicated the spot where her son was. `Poor boy! The girl shall die if you perish ere you reach the ship. I hope and pray the charms and spells she has thrown over you, will keep you in safety. But I have little faith in them to do any good, though they do evil enough. Oh my God above, spare my child!' she suddenly cried, as a crash of thunder shook the very earth, and made her soul shrink within itself with horror. `I can see my child no more!' She sank upon her knees in grief. `The gloom and distance has torn him from my sight.— To thy hand, oh, Jehovah of the seas, a mother's bleeding heart commits him! Curses light upon the girl who has done this!' she suddenly cried, rising to her 3 feet, and menacing with her arm the quarter where May had disappeared sometime before. The sea now began to roar with a terrible and deep baratone, and to fling its enormous billows against the reefs, over-leaping them, and tumbling noisily into the mouth of the bay. The ocean surface was yet polished as a mirror, but undulating with majestic and momentarily increasing motion. The movement was caused by other power than that of the winds, which yet were held suspended in midair. Suddenly there came to the ears of the woman, and to the ears of May and the dwarf, as they hugged the rock in their skiff, and to the ears of George and the negro, as they toiled together hard to reach the ship, and to the ears of the crew on board the frigate, the well-known and terrific voice of the unbounded storm. It was not thunder, but it was as loud as the loudest thunder. It seemed as if it thundered underneath the sea, and the caves of the ocean echoed the subterranean sound. The woman gazed appalled, her hands clasped upon her bosom. The old man shut to his door, and having barred it and sat in the darkness of blindness and solitude, listening to the dreadful noise without. May turned her eyes in the direction of the storm, and beheld on the level ocean, advancing towards the main-land, what to her imagination seemed like a vast army upon white steeds, rushing to battle along the surface of the sea. The winds had leaped from the clouds, and turned up the bosom of the sea in a long line for leagues, as a plough upturns the glebe. The heaped up waves came rolling on with fearful speed like mad coursers foaming at the bit. The thunder rolled above, the lightning flashed wildly across the sky, and cast a lurid fire upon the agitated waters, which out-roared the thunder. Chaos seemed returning to resume its empire over the earth and sea. For a moment May closed her eyes, and covered her face with her hands.— But she cast aside fear, and hoped that George had reached the ship in safety; for there were not three minutes space for him to gain had he not. `May, the waves will soon be upon us; hadn't we better pull into that hole under the rocks?' asked Tom. `No: it will be filled instantly by the sea. Pull on for a few rods further, and we shall get round that rock; we shall then have it between us and the billows, and before they can break over us we shall reach the beach.' `There will be a hard chance for us; but just as you say, May.' He pulled with tremendous exertion of his muscles about twenty rods further, the skiff all the while tossed like an egg-shell upon the under tow of the sea, and was with difficulty guided and kept from dashing against the cliff. `Once or twice more, strong and hearty, brother,' she cried; and as the willing dwarf obeyed, she steered the skiff adroitly round a low projection of the cliff, and was instantly in smooth water. It was now about five hundred yards to the snow-white beach, on which the heavy swells were unrolling in long polished rolls. The darkness was becoming momently greater, and the sea each instant increasing in wild tumult. `To the shore—land any where, where it is nighest!' shouted May to the dwarf. `The sea has overleaped the reef, and is rolling in upon us. Pull hard for our lives, brother!' Her voice could no longer be heard amid the shrieking of the tempest. The sea leaped the reefs, and came foaming and tossing like a myriad of whirlpools. The roar of the rain in the air, of the winds and the billows, was absolutely deafening. Quitting the stern, May seized one of the oars to aid her brother— but too late! Suddenly the skiff was lifted high in the air upon the brow of the leading wave, and hurled forward with such force as to dash it to pieces in its fall. The next wave submerged them both; but upon the third they rose together to the surface, May clasped in her brother's strong arm, which firmly encircled her waist. The faithful idiot buffetted with the billows manfully: now riding high upon a foaming surge, now making his way along the sands upon the bottom. At length he reached the main with his almost lifeless burden; and scrambling up the rocks where the waves could not reach her, he sat her down and took breath. It was a fearful time. The darkness and horror of the hour were increased by the whitish glare of the surges, that seemed to reveal the appalling scene without lessening the gloom. The rain fell in transparent sheets, the wind howled, and tore up pines, and toppled rocks from the precipices. It was with difficulty Tom could keep his footing, and hold his sister upon the shelf where he had placed her. `How be it with you, May?' he asked, placing his mouth to her ear and his fingers upon her pulse. `I am not hurt, brother; you have saved my life,' and she pressed his hand gratefully. `Can we reach the cottage?' `I will see when the next flash comes. Yes, it is not far off—we are on the Fern Ledge. Give me your arm—I will lead you safely, if you can stand.' He found that she could not, on account of the wind and rain and the slippery footing upon the rock. He grasped her in his arms, and throwing her across his broad shoulders, began to crawl on his knees round the rock, and up through a gap in its side. He soon gained a comparatively sheltered pathway, which he ascended with great difficulty and danger. But he reached the summit, and guided by the yellow lightning, dashed forward to the cottage, in a room of which he soon deposited his fair burden. `Thanks, noble and brave brother!— but for you I feel I should have perished in the sea, or on the rock. I had no power to aid myself, and was tossed by the waves like a wreath of sea-weed, when I felt your strong arm interposed beneath me: from that moment I felt that I should not die.' `No, if May should die, Tom would not care to live!' he answered with energy. `I feel so thanful for my escape! It was rash in me to attempt to return.— Poor George! my heart aches for his fate. Let us look from the windows, and see if we can see the frigate by the flashes of lightning.' She felt as if she could tell by her steering whether her lover was at her helm or not. CHAPTER IX. The Perilous Enterprise of our Hero. The mother of George Hunnewell continued to watch, as we have said, the receding skiff containing her son, until it was lost to her eyes in the gloom and distance. She remained still gazing eagerly in the direction of the frigate, which she could yet see floating motionless upon the deep, awaiting her fate. The storm which had overtaken May and the dwarf reached her; and still she clung to the shot, hoping yet that the lightning would give her a glimpse of her boy, and assure her of his safety. At length, unable to withstand the full force of the wind which swept with resistless fury over the cliffs, and dashed the spray high above her head, she sought the shelter of her cottage, which stood just below that of the old man's. Yet in the door of it she stood watching the sea with the most painful anxiety. Like May she felt that she could tell by the manner of the frigate's steering whether George were on board directing her course and guiding her destiny. The skiff had continued pulling on steadily and swiftly until it had got a mile from the landing-place, when George proposed to Buttermilk to take his place; seeing how the poor negro blowed at his task. `No, no, massa,' answered Buttermilk. `Dis nigger nebber giv up nor say die! Specially as you hab a lame arm!' `My arm doesn't trouble me now, Milk. Since I have seen Miss May I feel as if I was as well as ever. I will at least pull one of the oars.' `No, no, massa Jorge. It only bout three quarter ob a mile more. In de East Indgy I pulled Calcutta ribber all day, for thirty-six miles, me and de boat's crew. Dis boy nebber tire. Gorry massa, master Jorge! Don't it look amazin' black and ugly up dere to windward!— We hab to do our best to get to de ship.' `We shall reach it in time. The wind hasn't struck the sea yet in sight; and I could see it begin to turn up a line of foam ten minutes before it could reach us. But pull away strong; if you won't, let me. We shall have to do our best.' The shores, as he looked back, were fast disappearing in the increasing blackness that gathered around him. At intervals, by the glare of the lightning he fancied he could see his mother's tall form upon the rocks watching his progress, and doubtless, as he said to Buttermilk, sending up prayers for his safety; for though rude and coarse in her manners and of strong passions, and full of hatred to her kind, she loved her son with the sincerest affection. Nature in her bosom asserted and maintained her rights in spite of the grosser usurpation of fierce and uncontrollable passions; and George, while he loved his mother, feared and stood in awe of her. The skiff, as the rocky shores faded, began to come nigher and nigher to the frigate; and each moment it grew more distinct and larger to the eye of our hero. Stately and grand in all her war-like proportions she sat upon the breast of the broad ocean in majestic beauty. The heavy under-swell of the sea which moved like a huge heart with life in it, kept the ship swinging like a pendulum on the glassy surface of the undulations. As the skiff advanced, George fancied he could see the officers unpon her quarter-deck waving their hands. The frigate had ceased firing for some time; and he attributed this silence to their having discovered him. He was right in his conjecture. Many an anxious eye on board had been long and earnestly watching the inhospitable coast off which their ship was embayed, hoping as the report of each gun died among its cliffs, to see a fisher's boat emerge from the shore to their relief.— But more than one hundred guns were fired, and all was sllent and motionless whither their longing eyes were turned. The English commander had seen the danger of his situation as soon as the wind left him becalmed with a storm gathering in the south and west. He saw at a glance that unless he could tow out of the bay before the storm reached him, he would be in danger of losing his ship; for although there seemed to be good harbors on the coast within reach, he was ignorant of their pilotage. As soon as he had made himself fully acquainted with his position, he ordered, out his boats to tow off the land. But he soon found that this method was futile on account of the flowing tide which set him landward faster than the boats could resist it. He then called them on board; and anchoring in forty-nine fathoms, began to wait in hope that a light breeze would spring up before the storm should get full force and enable him to claw off the land. But the profound stillness of the air, the mirror-like surface of the ocean, the hazy mist gathering about the sun and the angry aspect of the heavens told him too plainly that the first wind that he should feel would be the full head of the tempest. He now began to think of a pilot to help him into one of the harbors when the storm should strike him. There was not a man on board who had any practical knowledge of that part of the coast, at least sufficient to risk running a ship into shelter in a gale. He resolved, therefore, in the imminency of the peril in which he found his ship to fire signals in hope of inducing some one from the shore to board him. Several guns were fired at intervals of a minute; but nothing moved in shore that he could see, though he closely scanned it with his glass. `These Yankees are either afraid of us or are too patriotic to venture,' said his first lieutenant to his commander. `They have often supplied our ships from the coast of Maine with fresh water and fresh provisions. Besides, we never interfere with fishermen. If they understood what we want, there are some of them who will come out to us!' `Yes, if they thought we should pay them well for it,' answered the first officer with a smile. `There is a boat rowing in shore, close under that cliff with the old white pine upon it,' said a midshipman who had a spy-glass at his eye. `I see it,' answered the captain, after watching it for a short time with his glass. `It seems to be coming out to us.— Tell them forward not to fire again at present.' The boat, however, instead of pulling strait out of the bay, doubled the headland and shortly went out of sight up the land. This disappearance was witnessed with deep disappointment visible on every anxious countenance. The English Captain looked at the rising cloud and gave orders to continue firing. The shores were now closely watched by the officers; but in vain. The storm came advancing up the sky, covering the sea with its dark shadow, while the thunder peals answered their artillery. Night grew on apace, and the signs of a fearful tempest thickened upon them. `This firing is likely to be powder thrown away,' said the Captain. `They are too much afraid of us, or do not understand our signals. We must trust to ourselves and the strength of our good ship, my friends,' he said, addressing his officers; `and with the favor of Providence, we may yet save the ship.' `Keep a sharp look-out till the last moment, there aloft!' called out the first lieutenant, hailing the fore-top. `Aye, aye, sir! There is something moving in the little bay abeam of us. I can't exactly make it out as a boat, sir, but it mout be and moutn't.' Half a dozen glasses were now in requisition, and brought to bear upon the point of the main-land indicated. The air was becoming murky, and a deep gloom hung upon the land, so that objects were but faintly discernible. `I see nothing,' answered the captain with looks of keen disappointment. `As we are here in this bay, becalmed, with this fierce wild storm ready to burst upon us, we might as well, for safety, be over a sea-volcano just ready to explode. `I can see it, sir. It holds two persons, and is pulling out from the land,' said a young officer with a sparkling star upon his breast. `There are two boats, both in motion, in the harbor,' said the senior lieutenaat with animation. `Ten to one, sir, we shall have a pilot now!' `If it is possible for a boat to reach us before the storm does. I see both boats now,' answered the captain, in a lively manner. `They have now separated and one of them hugs the cliff, while the other keeps on this way. God grant it may be a fisherman who knows the coast, that Heaven has inspired to come to our relief.' `Any seaman, sir,' said the young officer, `could at once understand the danger we are in, looking at us from the land, becalmed as we are, with a storm to windward, and a rocky lee-shore.— They could see that we would want help, without the hint our guns have given.— The boat keeps on.' `Yes, boldly. The other skirts the cliff; and seems to be making westward. But we will watch the one that seems to be coming to our assistance. The tempest comes on at a racing pace. Mr. Morpeth, you will again see that the guns are all lashed fore and aft, and that every thing is snug alow and aloft.— Have the storm-axes ready for use at a moment's warning; for we may be thrown on our beam ends at the first touch.— This is to be no child's play affair to-night.' `The boat pulls steadily out this way,' said the senior officer, watching with his glass the approach of George in his skiff. `Yes, and bravely too,' responded the Captain; `but unless he pulls harder, we shall hardly get him on board.' `He is certainly coming directly for us,' observed the quarter-master; `we are not deceived in this. If the storm keeps off twenty minutes longer, he will be up with us!' `God grant it!' ejaculated the captain. `With one of these fishermen on board at the helm, we can run before the gale into some one of these small bays, and so save the ship.' `At the risk of being taken, or set on fire from the shore by the Yankees,' said a junior lieutenant. `This is a thinly peopled coast; and no forts are any where about this region,' responded the officer, with the star upon his breast. `That thunder rings again!' observed the other, turning pale at the sound as if the very globe had cracked. The most vivid lightning followed, by the glimmer of which the little boat, to which all eyes were turned with the deepest interest, was seen steadily approaching. `Shall we fire again?' asked the officer, in charge of the signal guns. `No, sir. Lash the guns, and see that all the powder is returned to the magagazine at once. There is too much lightning in the air, and we are likely to be struck in any part of the ship.' The ship now began to feel the first pulsation of the storm in the heavy swell of the ocean. She rolled and pitched violently, though not a breath of air was yet moving. The white wall of surge advancing with its deafening roar, at length was visible to them, and while they were preparing the ship to meet the shock, all eyes were turned in the direction of the boat. Now it seemed to be lost in the hollows of the smooth billows; and now it was balanced for an instant upon the summit to be shot forward again, like an arrow, on her course. Nearer and nearer the little boat came. Buttermilk tugged laboriously at the oars, aided by George. Nearer and nearer advanced the black tempest, in its march across the ocean. The excitement on board the frigate was intense. It was a race between the storm and the skiff.— Involuntarily men in all parts of the frigate, forward as well as aft, shouted for them to hasten for their lives. George saw his danger. He forgot his arm and bent to the oars with 'Milk, with the most sinewy activity. On came the tempest, preceded by a wall of white foam. Its roar was appalling; and the sight of it sufficient to paralyze a stronger heart than that of our hero. Manfully he urged the little skiff over the billows. It seemed to fly. The crew and officers of the ship shouted, and waved their hands to cheer and encourage them.— The storm was not a quarter of a mile off, when they were within cable's length of the ship. `Ropes! Fling ropes to the brave fellows,' shouted the English Captain in tones of joyous relief. The next moment George sprung upon the lowest step of the gangway, amid a loud huzza; and as he touched the deck, the storm burst upon the ship. CHAPTER X. The Windward Gage. The roar of the tempest ere it struck the frigate was fearful. The up-rearing waves charged upon the ship like armed squadrons, with sounds not unlike the wild din of battle, the loud cannon rattling, the rolling musketry, `the thunder of the Captains and shouting!' All was confusion and terror. The storm stay-sails and jib burst instantly, like the sharp ring of artillery, and the fragments went whirling to leeward like feathers on the blast. The waves overleaped the ship and swept a score of living men into the waters to struggle with death. The frigate was thrown over upon beamends, and the cracking and rending of spars and cordage added their sounds to the storm. `Cut away the masts fore and aft!' shouted the English commander through his trumpet. His voice was scarcely heard in the fierce uproar of the elements; but men understood what he ought to have said, and sprung to unlose their axes, which began to fall upon the weather stays with a loud hacking noise. Stay after stay snapped and lashed the air furiously, and with a loud rending and flying of splinters went overboard the main-mast and mizen-mast. `Hold on the fore-mast! She rights!' thundered the Captain, as the ship rolled suddenly up to windward, and so far over that she took in water on that side. After a moment she lay upon an even keel, to the great joy of every soul on board; for at one moment with the immense weight of her guns, there was the most iminent danger of her capsizing keel upward. The instant peril was past and as the fierce, red lightning, which constantly shone, fell upon the faces of those on board it showed them looking one at another with expressions of gratitude. The danger, however, was far from being past. The roar of the winds was still terrific and their fury increasing. The huge mountainous billows lifted the dismasted ship upon their crests and hurled it forward unresistingly towards the land under her lee. The thunder rolled like an incessant cannonading; and seemed to be close over the deck. The clouds seemed to hang so low as nearly to touch the top of the only remaining mast, enveloping the sea in black pall. The ocean roared and tumbled like a sea of cataracts. The rain fell in glassy sheets, and the winds had become whirlwinds and went shrieking over the fated ship as if the air had been filled with demons. As soon as the Captain saw that the frigate was once more upon her legs, he gave orders to sound the wells; and finding she had not been strained so as to take in water he felt that the ship might yet be saved. `Young man,' he said, laying his hand impressively upon the arm of the youthful pilot, George, who had been thrown down with the rest when the ship was knocked over, and now was steadying himself by the capstan, `did you come on board as a pilot, for I have not yet had time to ask you?' `Yes, sir,' answered George, scarcely able to speak for the wind and rain, and unable to hear his own voice. The English Captain placed his ear close to his lips, and both stooped so as to be sheltered by the portion of the bulwarks that were not thrown down by the falling masts. `Our only safety is in being able to run into one of the harbours. Can you pilot me in?' `Yes, sir! I know the channel well!' `By night?' `As well as in the day; especially with the lightning to aid me.' `Good. Go to the helm and you shall have three men to help you at the wheel!' `I shall need them—I have an arm broken, and shall only be able to teach them how to steer; the black man here will aid also.' `That will do. Young man, if you save the ship, you shall have one hundred pounds.' `I did not come to be paid for my services, sir; money would hardly have tempted me to risk my life to reach your ship. Will she be able to carry a topsail close-reefed, sir, on her foremast, and a jib?' he asked, as if giving himself at once to his duties. `Yes, I think so.' `If you can get her under her topsail and jib, and rig a jury-mast aft so as to present a small bit of canvass to the wind, I think I can run her into Northrop's Bay.' `I will give the orders at once—we are drifting fast landward. Is there bold water here?' `Close up with the land, quite sufficient to float the frigate for a mile yet towards the shore.' `Where is this Bay?' `You can see the entrance, sir: wait for the next flash of lightning—it is between the two headlands, on one of which you will see a tall white landmark.' `I see it now—we shall have to lay close to the wind to get in.' `Yes, sir; but I think I can reach the Bay in safety if the ship holds together.' `You are a brave young fellow, and will do a noble deed if you save us to-night from the peril of our position,' answered the captain, as he turned and gave through his trumpet the necessary orders to get sail on the frigate. The winds and waves still roared and raved, and the ship was rapidly driven before it towards the land. All eyes were now fixed upon George as he went aft and stood by the helm. The officers watched him by the light battle-lanterns hanging round, and saw in his countenance a certain air of resolution and judgment which gave them confidence in him. They saw how his quick observing eye glanced over the ship, and then, as the lightning permitted, towards the land, as if cooly calculating the danger and the means of escape. They also fixed their attention with interest upon Buttermilk, who was at George's elbow, and whom they saw, by the young fisherman's command, take the first and most responsible position at the wheel. Two seamen, the best steersmen in the ship, were appointed by the captain to aid him. George took his post on the left of the wheel, a little elevated, so as to be able to con the ship from stem to stern. All this while the uproar and confusion of the tornado were dreadful. Orders had to be passed from man to man, and from ear to ear—for voices could no longer be heard. `That young man will do his duty,' said the English captain within himself; `if the ship can be saved he has an eye that shows me he can do it.' The fore-topsail was at length set, close-reefed, and another jib hoisted.— The mast bent forward like a withe beneath the force of the outward-stretching sails, and each moment every one on board expected to see the topsail blown clear out of the bolt-ropes, and tossed on the winds like tow. But it continued to hold its place, and drove the frigate forward almost with the speed of the tornado, plunging her bows deep beneath the billows, and tossing the spray in huge jets over the fore-top. Her course was as strait as an arrow for the land, which was not a mile distant, its cliffs rising, as they were seen by the flashes of lightning, out of an ocean of foam. `Mind your hand, young man!' cried the captain. `All our lives are in your hand—I hope you know what you are about.' George made no reply: his eye was upon the ship's course, and his whole soul seemed wrapped in the responsible duty he had taken upon himself. It was a sublime moral spectacle to see that young fisherman standing there the centre of all eyes—the hope of the lives of five hundred and seventy men. The ship continued her course right on for the land for a moment after the captain, in his anxiety, had spoken; and then George, catching one of the spokes of the wheel, called out in a loud clear tone,— `Brace up the fore-topsail—sharp up! —Hard a-lee!' The steersmen threw their whole weight upon the wheel—the ship's head rapidly came up into the wind, and the topsail swinging of itself—for no number of men could manage it—the vessel bore away upon the starboard tack as obedient to her helm as a cock-boat. This was a dangerous manœuvre at such a time, but its success confirmed the confidence of all on board in their youthful pilot. The ship's course was now about W. N. West, as close to the wind as she could lay with her jury mast and topsail, the only two sails that she could carry. The captain now came up and spoke to George with an air of respect and deference, as he would have addressed an old and experienced pilot.' `Where do you intend to run in, sir?' Between the two headlands I before pointed out, sir. Keep her nigh, men? Look sharp for the Porpus Ledge, Milk, and just make it in a line with the bow-sprit.' `I see it massa Jorge. Dere no ledge dere now, ony de white froth. If de wind hold dis a-way we hab to chance runnin' on de Foxes; coz de tide run in like debbel.' `Keep her steady as you are.' answered George. `Don't you want the lead hove again, sir,' asked the captain. `No, sir. I have fished on every fathom of this coast. I know its depth anywhere. We are now in twenty-eight fathoms. Luff a little, Milk. You are falling off; and you well know if we get to leeward of the Ledge we are gone without hope.' `Do you mean to try and weather that foaming rock ahead?' asked the captain. A loud peal of thunder close above their heads, and the increased roar of the waves prevented him from replying. At length he answered, `I shall weather the Ledge if possible. The ship's safety depends on it. If we fall to leeward of it we shall strike on a sunken shoal and go to pieces.' `Then for God's sake watch your helm young man.' `They steer right now. We shall, no doubt, pass the danger safely; but as it requires all my attention, please don't speak to me till it is passed.' `You are right. It was soon understood by every man in the ship that their safety depended on weathering the vast bank of foam that seemed to lay directly in their course, about a third of a mile ahead. The foam upon the ledge could be seen without the aid of the lightning, by its own phosphorescent light. It was an appalling spectacle. Every eye gazed upon it as if it were a grave. Every few seconds the course of the ship was reported from mouth to mouth; the report now producing pleasure as the distant opening between the bow and the ledge seemed wider, and now turning every face pale with fear, as it decreased in breath; The rain as suddenly ceased as it had come on, and the atmosphere being clear, showed them their danger in all its dread aspects. The wind still howled, and the thunder rattled, and the sea roared and dashed against the frigate's sides with terrible blows, shaking her to her centre. The young fisherman kept his eye upon the course of the ship, and gave his orders with coolness and decision. Nearer and nearer they approached the danger, and now the roar of the breakers up on the ledge rises above the raving of the storm. The distance every instant lessens. The frigate rolls, plunges, dashes on and seems for an instant before reaching it to be about to plunge headlong into the vortex. All is breathless expectation. `Steady, as you are,' said the young fisherman in a quiet tone of voice. The whole sea around the bow seemed a whirlpool. Its surface was white with foam. The noise of the surges was deafening. The crisis is at hand. For a moment the ship seems to be among the breakers. But it is only for an instant. She drives on past the reef in safety, but so near that the black heads of the rocks could be seen lifting themselves from the frothy billows within thirty feet of the ship's quarter. Another moment and the foaming gulf was past and was seen astern; and the joyful sense of safety to the hundreds on board found vent in a shout that out-shouted the storm. The ship stood on steadily in the same course for about three minutes, when George, who had been all the while calm and collected, and who looked as if he was only engaged in an ordinary duty, gave orders to put the frigate's head before the wind. It was obeyed with alacrity, and the half dismantled ship of war, stately in her ruins, bounded swiftly onward before the tempest in the direction of the entrance to Northrop's bay. CHAPTER XI. The Moorings. The captain of the English frigate upon seeing the ship safely past the reef onwhich nothing but a miracle seemed possible to keep it from being wrecked, grasped the hand of his youthful pilot with enthusiasm. `Noble young man, you have saved the lives of all on board by your skill and coolness. You shall have double the sum I promised you if you get us safely into the bay!' `I ask no reward, sir,' answered George. `Did you not come on board tempted by the hope of large pay?' asked the captain, surprised. `No, sir; I would not take money for the lives of men; much more from my country's enemies!' `Ha! This speech rings! If you speak in this way, why did you come to our aid at all?' `Keep her away more, helmsman!' cried George, not wishing to reply.— `Captain, the danger is by no means past. Open as the entrance to the bay appears to us, and fair as the gale blows to drive us in, there is a dangerous ledge mid-way the bay, just inside the open passage to it. A strong current sets that way, and with the heavy sea running the ship will be in as great peril as any she has come through until we get by the ledge.' `The ship is in your hands, sir! I leave the whole to you! I can do nothing!' `I will do my best, sir. Have some of your men ready at the topsail-braces; for we must luff up sharp very soon, and stand at right angles with our present course. There are three short turns to take in getting into this bay; and if the ship obeys her helm as well as she has done, in twenty minutes we shall be in smooth water.' `Can you see well enough by the flashes of lightning?' `Yes, sir. So long as I can get a glimpse now and then of the Scathed Pine I can steer with safety.' It was now busily rumored through the ship that the whole danger was not yet passed. Their confidence in their pilot from what they had witnessed, prevented the crew from yielding to their former alarm. Still all was anxiety and suspense. The hurricane still swept the sea ike a besom, the wind howling concert with the roaring billows. At intervals, glimpses of the rocky shore could be got as the lightning illumined the wild scene; and many an eye was strained at such instants to see if the steep cliffs afforded any shelter or path-way for them to escape the surges should the ship strike. Suddenly a bright light shot up from the land, and the brilliant flame of a bonfire cast its radiance over the gloomy land. `What is that?' cried the English captain. `It is a signal-light kindled by a friend, to enable us to get in more easily;” answered George, who saw in this the watchful hand of May, and knew thereby that she had safely reached her home. `Blessings on the noble girl,' he said mentally. `That light is kindled for me. In it I can see that I am remembered. If Heaven permit, I shall soon be by thy side again.' The light attracted great attention and awakened the deepest interest on board. It seemed to them a beacon of hope—a promise of safety. She ship rolled on her landward course with resistless power. At every heavy plunge of her bows into the concave seas those on board trembled till she rose again, lest the rocks should meet her keel. The cliff upon which the Scathed Pine stood was now very near. Men had to look up to see it from the deep. The ship went on rapidly strait for it without lessening her tremendous speed, and was within a cable's length, when the young pilot's trumpet-like voice was heard giving the order `to put down the helm and brace up!' Instantly the ship came into the wind, and leaving the cliff astern. She had passed so near, that a dollar might have been thrown against the face of the rock. Every heart ceased beating for a moment till she was making her way off from the danger in safety. `That was a risk, young sir,' said the Captain, catching his breath as he saw the frigate had way again on the starboard tack. `It was necessary, sir, to go so close, in order to be able to get to leeward of the ledge on this tack,' answered George calmly. `Where is the ledge?' `You will see it in this direction. There is a line of breakers upon it.' `Yes, I see it now. It is to windward of the ship's course,' he said joyfully. `Yes, and we have got this advantage by running so close in under the cliff,' swered George. `If I had hauled wind two minutes sooner, I should have had to run to windward by the ledge, and as the current sets very strong into this bay, I should have been afraid of losing the ship by driving her on the ledge!' `I have seen enough of shaving reefs to-night,' answered the Captain; `and if we should have been in as great danger in passing to windward of this as the other one, I won't say any thing more about your approaching so near the cliff.' `The danger would have been greater on account of the greater swiftness of the current at this place.' `You are a bold and skilful pilot, young man. I feel that my ship is safe in your hands.' `I trust in a few minutes that she will be past all the danger, sir. Keep her close, 'Milk,' he called to the negro, who had not quitted his post by the wheel from the first; and who promptly and intelligently obeyed every order of the youthful fisherman. His hands seconded the words of George in every instance, and as it were simultaneously, as if he anticipated the direction to be given; and indeed he knew well how to steer the ship in; but he could not have done it alone, for want of that coolness and self-possession which George possessed in a far superior degree. The ledge was now visible a-head.— Gradually the ship's bows fell off from it, after hugging it closely a few minutes, and the helm being closely put up, and the fore-yard squared, the ship steered directly up the bay, and in almost smooth water. `Are your anchors ready, sir?' asked George. `What! are we in safety?' cried the Captain, who, in the darkness, could not tell his situation. `Yes, sir. The dangers are all far astern,' responded the pilot. `In a moment or two more I shall bring the ship to where you can drop anchor and ride the storm out in perfect security.' `The ship is safe!—the ship is safe!' rung along the decks from stern to stem. `Stand by to cast the best bower there forward,' was the cheerful order passed forward from mouth to mouth. The men were cheering and congratulating each other, and all speaking in praise of the youthful pilot. `Helm-a-lee! Hard-a-lee!' shouted George. `Ha-a-r-rd a-le-e-ee!' responded 'Milk and the two steermen. The ship, making a noble curve, came obediently into the wind; the topsail fell upon the cap; and in a moment or two afterwards the heavy anchor plunged from the bows. The ship came easily to her moorings, for there was scarcely any sea in the sheltered bay which she had reached; and the lightning showed the English Captain and his crew that they were anchored within three cables' length of a snow-white beach, and just under the cliff on which still blazed the dying embers of the beacon light. The storm still raged with relentless fury; but it was comparatively little felt where the frigate now lay. The deep roar of the surges beating against the cliffs and ledges reached their ears, impressing the crew with the delightful sense of present safety. The frigate now being in perfect security, the English Captain was going up to the young pilot to embrace him and thank him, and press upon him a large reward for services that he felt could hardly be repaid by any amount of money, when a look-out from the starboard quarter shouted, `Sail ho! `Where away?' demanded the captain, stopping to take his spy-glass. `In the offiing, sir. I saw it just now, as the lightning shone. She seemed to be a small vessel, so far as I could judge, scudding under close reeffed mainsail! All eyes upon this were turned seaward; for there was at once awakened in every bosom a lively sympathy for the stranger, who was combatting with the dangers they had so safely passed. `It is a shallop,' cried the English captain, as he surveyed the sail through his spy-glass. `She seems to be trying to make the bay.' The darkness prevented George from seeing her, for some moments; but he watched the returning flashes of lightning, and caught a glimpse of the vessel; he saw at once that it was a fisherman's craft, but whether sloop or schooner was not discernable. `The poor fellow,' said the captain will hardly fare as well as we have done; for there cannot be in this bay two pilots like yourself. I believe no other man could have piloted the frigate in. Your skill and coolness are admirable, young man. To-morrow I shall talk with you about taking service under the King.' `I am an American,' responded George in a tone of lofty patriotism. `Nobly answered, young fisherman,' said the officer already alluded to, as having his breast adorned with a star, which glittered in the lightning, as if composed of the costliest stones. `See! there fires up the beacon again,' said the Captain. `They see the fisherman from the shore, and would help him on his way.' `That shallop seems to be exactly between us and the outer-reef,' cried one of the officers. `She seemed to be rushing to certain destruction, as I beheld her by that last blaze of lightning.' `Then it is a certain proof that he is familiar with the entrance to the bay,' answered George. `He should run so, for at least five minutes longer; and then tack as the frigate did.' `Yes, I see! I am glad the poor fellow knows how to run in. But for you, we should ere this have gone ashore on the other side of the head-land.' `Captain, will you oblige me with a boat to return on shore,' said George.— `It is so smooth now here that there is no danger in sending one off.' `None at all, nor any objection. But you had best remain on board to-night.' `I have performed my duty, sir. I can give you no further aid. I prefer being on shore.' `But we shall need you to go out of the harbor again;' answered the captain, hesitating. `It is easy enough to go out with the lead in the day time, after you shall have refitted.' `And that will consume two or three days. We shall have to be brief and active about it, or news will be sent to some American cruiser that we are here, and we shall be caught in a trap. I would prefer you should remain.' `Is this a command?' asked George, with a resolute air. `Not exactly.' `Then, if you do not intend, sir, to re ward my services by detaining me as a prisoner you will have the goodness to suffer me to leave the ship.' `Will you promise to come on board and pilot me out?' `I cannot, sir! I have saved your ship and the lives of your men as an act of common humanity. I can go no farther by piloting you to sea again, without proving traitor to my country!' `Very well spoken, young man. I admire your spirit and commend your firmness, even though I may be the sufferer by it. You shall have a boat for yourself and your man.' The gig was ordered to be lowered and brought to the gang-way. The captain approached George and said, `My brave young man, here are three hundred guineas in this package. You have earned it by the service you have this night done me and those who sail with me. Take it, and with it bear away our grateful sense of your humanity and courage. We had no right, as the foe of your land, to expect this service at your hands. You have shown yourself a generous and noble person, superior to every selfish feeling. And here my fine fellow,' added the captain, placing a purse in Buttermilk's hand, `here are twenty guineas for yourself; for you have done your part as well as your master.' CHAPTER XII. The Shallop. `Thank'ee, massa Cap'n, said Buttermilk, as he took the purse given him by the English Captain, and after balancing it in his hand dropping it into his pocket. `But you do not refuse, sir!' said the Captain, with surprise as George put back the souleans of gold, saying, `No, sir, I have not done this for money!' `But certainly you will let me pay you something!' `Nothing, sir. I am rewarded by seeing your ship and those on board in safety.' `I will increase the reward!' `It is more than enough, sir. You have paid the black; that will do. I do not know how either to charge for men's lives, or to take gold from my enemy. What I have done, I have done!' `You are an extraordinary young man!' exclaimed the Captain, in tones of disappointment; for he felt that he owed a debt that would always weigh upon him unless the pilot took the gold. `Good night, sir. I see the boat is ready for me!' said George, going to the gang-way. `Good night, then. You will not very soon be forgotten on board this ship!' said the English Captain, shaking him warmly by the hand. `Massa Cap'n,' whispered Buttermilk, lingering behind a step, as George went over the side, `if you gib de gold to dis child he keep 'em for massa George!' `That; my good fellow,' cried the Captain, placing the money in his hand, not a little gratified to be able to force its acceptance in this way upon the sensitive and proud young man. `What is your master's name?' `Jorge Hunnywell, massa cap'n.' `He shall never be forgotten. You seem to be a good pilot.' `Yes, massa,' answered Buttermilk, busily stowing away the gold in different parts of his apparel. `Will you come off and pilot us out when we sail?' `When dat be, massa cap'n?' `In about forty-eight hours or three days. I will pay you fifty pounds;—the signal for you shall be two guns.' `I'll be dere, massa cap'n,' answered Buttermilk emphatically. `Milk!' called out George from the boat, which was dancing like an egg-shell alongside, and was with difficulty kept by boat-hooks and pikes from being dashed against the frigate's side. `Comin', massa Jorge,' answered the negro, stowing the last roleau away in the fob of his waistband—for fob he had, though he had never owned a watch in his life. The black was soon in the gig, and six men at the oars soon sent it flying across the space between the ship and the beach. Although the bay was so much sheltered that the full power of the ocean billows did not reach it, yet a short, chop sea was agitating it, that made the passage somewhat perilous, The current also, aided by the gale, set them strongly towards the perpendicular cliffs east of the landing. `You will have to put out all your strength, my men,' called out George; `or we shall be lifted up and dashed against the wall of rock there to leeward. If we miss the beach we are lost.' This address inspired them with a strength and energy almost superhuman, and the gig went leaping from wave to wave as if a conscious thing, and was striving in itself to escape the danger under the lee. `The storm still holds its own outside,' said the coxswain. `The ocean beyond the reefs roars like a volcano. That shallop will hardly get in—do you think it will, sir?' `If it contains William Northrop there is no fears for its safety,' answered George. `And who is he?' `The man for whom this bay is named; he is an old fisherman who lives on the cliff where you saw the bonfire a little while ago—he is the most experienced pilot and seaman on the coast.' `Not a better pilot than you are, sir, I'll make oath,' responded the cozswain, warmly. `We all owe our lives to you, sir,. Give way strong men. We can master the tide-set, if you lay out all you have got.' The men renewed teeir vigorous exertions, and the gig bravely weathered the cliff. `Ha! what is that to windward of us?' cried the coxswain, as a flash of lightning exposed the prospect around them, and pointing to a dark object which seemed to be moving, like some huge fish, swiftly along the water about two hundred rods to the west of them. `It is a boat,' answered George. `Yiss,' added Buttermilk, `dat boat, massa, and no mistake. Wait till the lightnin' shine agen, and we tell better.' It was some moments before there was another flash, when both George and Buttermilk exclaimed, `The surf-skiff.' `What is that?' `The life-boat. It is putting off to the frigate,' said George, who had made the object out to be the boat we have seen suspended in the entry of Northrop's cottage: though he could not distinguish those in it. It was moving rapidly out from the land, with one oarsman and one in the stern. His thoughts at once reverted to May; and he believed that she had embarked in it with Tom, for the purpose of bringing him off from the ship. `Coxswain, put back and pursue that boat?' he cried, impressed with the idea, and alarmed for her safety at such a `It is some of my friends going for me.' `It will be dangerous to turn the boat to meet this swell, sir,' answered the coxswain. George hesitated, uncertain whether he ought to run this risk, when it might not be May after all;' `but who then could it be?' he asked of himself; for there were only those at the cottage; and that it was the Surf-Skiff he was sure, as when he caught sight of it, it was riding half its length out of the water upon the arch of a great wave. Another blaze of lightning removed his doubts; for he saw the graceful and spirited figure of May at the helm, guiding fearlessly the flying bark over the tumbling billows. `Put about? Back wate, larboard oars,' he cried quickly. `Coxswain, we must put back and overtake that boat. There is one in it who is dearer to me than my own life; and who will perish if she ventures farther out. `It will be dangerous to bring the head of the boat round, sir, in such a swell. 4 `This is not one of your fishing skiffs.' `Try it. It must be done,' he cried taking the helm from the coxswain's grasp, and bringing the boat round. `Back water on the larboard side. Pull hard, starboard oars. Hard! for your lives! for your lives, men! It was too late, the result which the coxswain had anticipated occurred. As the gig swung round broadside to the sea, in turning about, a monstrous wave lifted it bodily upon its crest, and flinging it many feet almost through the air, turned it bottom upwards, and scattered its crew to struggle for their lives. Fortunately they were not far from the beach, which they all at length succeeded in gaining, tho' Milk from the weight of gold about him came very near being drowned. The boat was carried by the waves to leeward against the cliffs and wrecked, being stove into a hundred pieces by the sharp rocks upon which it was tossed. As soon as George could recover his feet he looked eagerly over the bay, striving, in vain, to penetrate the darkness, in search of the Surf-Skiff. But it was some minutes before a flash from the sky gave him a view of it, still riding the waves in safety, but already far beyond the frigate, as if steering seaward. `What can that mean, Milk,' he said, addressing the black. `Can't tell, massa.' `It was certainly the surf boat, and I saw a female figure in it, that could have been no other than May's.' `Sartain. I see her by de lightning as plain as if de sun shone,' responded Buttermilk. `My friends follow me to the summit of the cliff. The black man will guide you to a house not far from here where you will be sheltered till the storm is over.' Without waiting for a reply, the young pilot hastened up the pathway to the cottage. He passed on the green the remains of the bon-fire which had been seen from the frigate; and rushed towards the cottage. He felt confident it could have been no other than May in the boat; but he wished to remove all doubt. He entered the cot, and by the light of a lamp which hung above the door saw that the surf-boat was gone. He called loudly on her name; but there was no reply. He called for the dog, but there was no answering bark. `It was she. She has ventured her life for what I know not. Rash girl. Dearest May. What madness has led thee to this step. Just as I have found thee, and learned that I am loved, I am doomed to lose thee forever.' He left the solitary cottage, and came out upon the cliff to wait for the flashes of lightning to reveal him the ocean. He saw by them the dismantled frigate pitching at her anchorage, half a mile distant, the life-boat dancing over the waves beyond her, and approaching the reef, and beyond the reef a dark object tossed upon the bosom of the tempest. What could it be? It had no sail set as the shallop had when last seen by him; yet he feared that it was the sloop. `Did you see dat, massa?' inquired Buttermilk as he came near him, followed by the crew of the gig. `It was de shallop dismantled.' `So I thought and feared. This accounts for the launching of the life-boat. This accounts for May's rash departure on the wild sea this fearful night. She saw the danger of the sloop, supposed, or recognized, it to be her father's, and prompted by filial duty, has ventured her life to give him a chance for his own.' `Yiss, dat's it, massa. Missy May hab courage like a man, and don't fear duckin' in salt water no more dan fish. She good sailor.' `She will perish. The surf is running mountains high across the ledge. If she attempts to reach the shallop she is lost inevitably.' He began to pace the cliff in despair, at every flash of the almost constant lightning straining his eyes after the little boat which contained all dear to him on earth. The men, in the meanwhile entered the cottage, and Buttermilk taking upon himself to act the host, found Northrop's store of rum, and filled them cans ail round. The conjecture of the young man had been the right one. May, engaged in watching the struggles of the frigate with the elements, aiding it with her prayers, after she saw it pass safely into the bay, felt sure that none other than George had been at the helm. Her anxiety, therefore, for his safety was removed; and she expected soon to see him on shore to receive her thanks for his prompt obedience to her commands in saving the endangered frigate of the enemy. `Now God be thanked!' she exclaimed; `both the ship and George are safe. He has done a noble act, and been the means of saving many souls from a watery grave. He will land as soon as the frigate anchors.' She saw the ship come to her moorings and remain stationary; and was giving thanks to Heaven in her heart for the consummation of the ship's safety, when Tom called her attention to a sail in the offing. `Impossible, brother! no sail could stand this hurricane. It was the cap of some larger wave than usual.' `Wait a moment, sister May! There, see now by the flash!' `It is a sail!' `I said so.' `It seems to be that of a very small vessel!' `Watch out again, May, for the next flash!' `I see it plainly now. It is a shallop.' `Scudding with her main-sail more than half reefed down,' said Tom. `It is the old man's too. `You can't tell at this distance, and in such a storm.' `None but father would think o' runnin' into the bay in such a storm. I tell you its the old devil, May! His shallop is the only one on the coast that has reef-points half way up the main-sail, and can reef so close. The sail he carries isn't six feet above deck. It's the old man or the devil! No other small craft could swim in such a sea, and no other skipper think of steering her in!' `See the shallop is broadside to us now, and is running between the ledges and the cliff.' `That shows it's the old 'un. Nobody else but George Hunnewell and I knows the channel like that.' A flash of lightning now illumined the sea and land far and wide. The shallop was seen, but dismasted and tossing, a wreck upon the waves. The storm was driving her furiously upon the ledge which the frigate had so narrowly escaped. All this was seen in an instant—in the brief instant of a lightning flash! But it was enough to show the young girl the imminent peril of the sloop. CHAPTER XIII. Nortkrop, the Skipper. `There is no doubt that it is our father's shallop,' said May. `At all events, the lives of those on board are in jeopardy, and I will not let them perish if there is a chance of getting aid to them. Lower the life-boat, Tom, and hasten with it to the beach while I take the oars and buoys.' `It will be a hard row, May, and I don't care to risk bein' drowned for the old un,' answered Tom doggedly. `I will give you a new green jacket and a red waistcoat, Tom, if you will go with me.' `You won't deceive me, now, May?' he said, his eyes brightening up, and his whole face expressive of his satisfaction. `No. When May gives you her word it is sacred, Tom.' `I'll go, then,' he answered decidedly. `If we are drowned, I shall drown with you, and so go up to Heaven with you.' In less than ten minutes the surf-boat was taken from its place in the cabin, carried on the dwarf's shoulders down to the beach, and launched into the frothy waves. It was very light, and buoyant as a nautilus, and was tossed on the waves like a feather. May sprang into it with the oars,—the dwarf sent it out upon the billows with a strong arm, followed her at a bound, and began to ply his oars.— It was some moments before they could get away from the shore; but, when they did, the strong arms of the idiot sent the boat forward in the face of the storm with astonishing speed. May was so intent on the duty she had undertaken, that she did not see the gig to leeward of her. As she came near the frigate, she would gladly have gone on board to have got George to aid her, and also called on the crew to follow her in a boat. But she felt that every moment's detention might prove fatal to her father; for she was confident it was his shallop. She therefore left the frigate to leeward and held her way straight out to the ledge. The boat was seen from the ship, and as it was evidently a surf-boat, its mission was understood; for the situation of the dismasted shallop was plainly visible whenever the lightning permitted objects to be seen. But the English Captain, finding that it would be impossible to pull one of the frigate's heavy boats to windward, and to attempt it would endanger more lives than he might hope to rescue, gave no orders to follow the example of the surf-boat. The little messenger of life, however, was watched with the deepest interest. The shallop could be seen every now and then drifting towards the reef. At times it seemed to be lost in its foam; but again would re-appear a helpless wreck rolling onward to destruction at the mercy of the waves. George continued to watch the life-boat's progress trom the cliff, in the greatest anguish. He saw the whole extent of her danger on such an enterprize, and the more he reflected upon her courage and daring, which were ever ready handmaids to her humanity, he trembled the more; for he knew that she would count her life nothing so that she could save that of her father. He recalled her former acts of generous bravery in saving the perishing, herself also saved; but he derived no consolation from this reflection. `She will never return. Such a storm as this she never ventured out in. Besides, before, when she saved the five persons from the ledge, she had her father and Tom with her. Now she probably has only Tom, who is not always to be depended on in the hour of greatest peril.' These words were uttered aloud. Buttermilk, who was by, answered, `Nebber you fear for Missy May, Mass' Jorge. She nebber be drowned so long as dere be a angel in heaben to hold her pretty head 'bove de waves. I don't feel least consarned at all, Massa Jorge. You mind me. She sure to come back safe herself; but wedder she bring back old Northrop alive is a nodder question.' `I hope I shall see her again safe, but I fear not.' `Well, it nebber do no good to stand here takin' on. Massa better come in, for de wind blow him off de cliff for sartain.' `No. I shall remain here, and by the aid of the friendly lightning, watch the progress of the skiff. If she is lost, life has no more charms for me.' `Nebber say die, Massa Jorge!' responded Buttermilk, in a resolute tone. `I there saw the skiff. It is close to the ledge, and to windward of it. It seemed to be trying to pass between the ledge and the shallop! No power on earth can save it!' This was, also, the opinion of those on board the frigate, who watched as well as they could with their glasses, the fate of the sloop, and the bold surf-boat. To the officers it seemed trying to cut off the shallop, ere it should be flung upon the reef. `Whoever manages that boat,' said the young officer with the star upon his coat, `has a true hand, and a fearless heart.' `And is reckless of life,' said the captain; `for the boat will hardly get out of that surf alive, if it once gets into it. What brave, skilful fellows these Maine fishermen are.' `The skiff was no longer visible by that flash!' said an officer, in a tone of anxiety. `I fear it has capsized.' `No doubt of it. If my own father or child was in that shallop, I should hardly venture out to that ledge in such a pampero as this to try to save 'em,' said the quarter-master. `Both shallop and surf-boat are likely to be lost,' was the response of the English captain. `It is a pity. For whoever has launched that boat, and guided it so resolutely thus far, deserves a better fate. Has any one been able to see where the gig landed?' `No, sir.' `No signs of her return.' `No, sir,' was the answer from the lieutenant of the deck. `I fear they have been swamped.— Fire a gun, Mr. Mervin, to bring them off, if they should be loitering on the shore!' The gun was discharged, awakening the echoes of the encircling cliffs, and lighting up the bay with its flash. `Send up a blue light, sir,' said the captain. `Send up three, one after the other, so that we can have a look at the shore; and also see what is become of the shallop.' But we will not wait for the rockets to go up, but follow the surf-skiff as she approached the shallop. As we have already described, the shallop was outside the bay, dismasted and drifting, without human remedy, fast upon the inner ledge, over the long line of which the wild waves of the storm, lashed deep, foamed and roared with appalling power. The rain had some time ceased, and here and there a chasm opened in the dark curtain of clouds, that were rolling along upon the black wings of the tempest. The wind outside had lessened its force in no degree, but went howling on over the ocean, and ploughing up its blue depths, and turning out its snow-white lining like paths of snow. The strange sail, when first seen from the frigate, was coursing like an affrighted bird over the wild scene, with only a small sail closely reefed, presented to the gale. It was a small, sloop-rigged, craft, of the rudest description, containing two old fishermen, and two young men or youths. Her forward deck was open, and the cargo protected with tanned canvass. At the helm, stood a strong built, grey-headed man, of large stature, and stern visage. His countenance was deeply lined with the furrows of a hardy and exposed life; and upon his brow were impressed resolution and courage, that amounted almost to ferocity. His large frame was dressed in a long coarse blue storm-coat; he wore a tarpaulin upon his head, lapping over his ears, and high boots that reached to his knees. As he stood at the helm, his keen eye bent forward upon the wild flight of his little craft, there was no signs of fear of the result. Firm and cool he stood at his post, riding on the storm, like its presiding spirit. Behind him stood a young fisherman, broad-shouldered and ill-made, who aided him in holding the tiller in its place.— Forward were the others; one of them was a thin, old man, with a long back and longer limbs; the other, a lad with a black head of hair, exceedingly black restless eyes that shone like diamonds, a dark skin, and teeth like the most brilliant ivory. He wore a red flannel shirt, or what was left of it, and a pair of duck trowsers cut off at the knee. He was bare-headed, and his legs and feet were naked. In shape, he was a young Apollo; and in his bearing and fearless eye he showed the calm and fearless character of the untamed child of the forest. It was a noble spectacle to see the little vessel go swooping onward from wave to wave, half the time submerged, and at others with the spray leaping over her in cataracts of sparkling foam. All around her the sea, where it was not inky black, was white, like cream. The billows rolled now on the right, now on the left of her, higher than her straining mast; and occasionally a gigantic wave would give it a chase astern, and coming up with it, swift as it blew, hang above it for an appalling moment, and then leap with a hissing roar upon its deck, plunging the little vessel far beneath the surface. But, buoyant as a water-fowl, the shallop would rise to the surface, shake off the volumes of water, and go again bounding upon her mad way. The helmsman of the shallop was William Northrop, the father of May Fawn. His crew were composed of a father and son, poor neighbors, who lived near Cape Small Point; and a young full-blooded Indian of the Tarrantine tribe. William Northrop kept his eyes fixed resolutely upon the reef before him. He was fully alive to the danger of his situation. He would have laughed at the storm, if he could have carried sail enough to govern the course of his shallop and keep her to her helm. But the wind swept the sea so strongly that he had to reef his mainsail down almost close to the deck; for to display any more canvass to such a hurricane would have been to be driven bodily under the surface. At this moment they saw the beacon on the cliff, and also first caught sight of the frigate after she had passed the inner ledge. The beacon showed Northrop that he was seen; but he could not explain the appearance of the frigate. `Saul,' he said to the old man; `I wonder how that ship has got into the bay. I find the current sweeps towards White Pine Head faster than we can run towards the entrance. Some one has lighted a beacon fire, for us or the ship. It will do us no good. The old Porpus Ledge ahead of us is howling and foaming like a pack of mad wolves!' `I've made up my mind, Cap'n Northrop,' answered the old man with a melancholy shake of his long grey head. `What do you mean?' `I mean to say that this ere shallop never 'll drop anchor again in the bay. She'll never see Porpus Reef astern on her. We are driving jist as fast as wind and water can carry us right slap on to the reef!' `Not if I can help it, Saul,' answered Northrop with resolutely clenched teeth as he stooped and bent his keen eyes ahead. `It will be a tight push, though!' he added as his eyes fell on the long wall of snowy spray! Hard up with the helm!' he called to his assistant. `We must try and weather this ledge on a tack. If we run on this way, we are lost to a certainty.' `I know'd it, Cap'n,' responded the old man, with another shake of the head. `We shall be sure never to get in this night. If you have any sins, as men say you have, to repent of, I'd recommend you to think of 'em! We can't get out o' this. See! How the sea piles itself up on the ledge in great waves. No, no! Long as I've been on the coast, man and boy, I never seed nothing like this!' `Hold on all!' shouted William Northrop, as the shallop came round to the wind under the influence of the helm. The sheet-block of the main-sail was wrenched from its bed by the force with which the boom was jerked as the vessel came to the wind,and the sail went swinging overboard slatting wildly and furiously. It swung three quarters round the mast, clearing the deck in its dreadful sweep. The old man was struck in the head and knocked many feet into the sea, in which he sunk shrieking. CHAPTER XIV. The Reef. It was a fearful moment. The shallop was at the mercy of the storm. The end of the boom would have caught William Northrop up also and hurled him into the seething billows, but for his presence of mind in throwing himself flat upon the deck and clasping a ring-bolt firmly with both hands. The shallop rocked wildly from side to side totally unmanageable. The mast at length yielded to the terrible force of the unlashed boom and was carried, sail and all, over the side into the waves. `Thank God, it's gone!' was the exclamation of William Northrop on hearing the crash. `If it had stood a minute longer it would have dragged the shallop under.' He sprung to his feet and seized the helm to lash it to the lee side, so as to keep her head as much away from the reef as possible. But this was of little use, and he felt that it could help him none. All was quiet on board save the voice of the tempest which ceased not.— He strained his eyes to see if he had any one of his crew. `Who is here?” he shouted as his shallop rolled over the billows, each moment approaching nearer the roaring breakers upon the ledge. `Me,—White Teeth;' answered the Indian lad, suddenly appearing over the side on deck, and shaking himself like a water-dog. `Where are the rest?' `Knock 'em over in em sea;' answered the lad. `Fish catch em!' `Poor fellows. Old Saul seemed to forebode this.' `Nebber mind be sorry for dem; we be sorry for ourself pretty soon.' `I am afraid so. We shall have enough to do to think of ourselves. My poor little May! If I should perish here tonight what would become of my little Fawn of the cliffs! White Teeth?' `Well, what Grey Eyes speak to him?' `If I am lost and you save yourself, I wish you to give this case to my child. I will place it around your neck. I have worn it next my heart for years. If you are lost and I am saved I can tell her what I would. But if I am lost and this reaches her hands I shall have done my duty even to death!' As he spoke he placed round the neck of the young Indian a chain of steel, to which was appended a circular, flat box, made of tin, and about four times the size of a Spanish dollar. `If me swim shore me do as you say,' answered the Indian. `That is all I can ask. We have neither of us much chance of escaping our death to-night, White Teeth. You see we are driven against a boiling sea, that the winds are lashing into foam.— Before us, not half a mile distant, is the reef which will bring us up. Nothing can check our course now. In ten minutes we shall be tossed upon its breakers like a feather! No two planks of the shallop will hang together five minutes. There is no alternative but to be drowned or thrown upon the rocks to be mangled. God have mercy upon me, for I have been a wicked man! I never looked forward to this hour as I see and feel it now.' The strong man covered his brow with his hand for a moment. He seemed to be casting himself in silent prayer upon the mercy of his God. He felt now the impotency of man's arm or human aid. The majesty and power of the Creator were around him invested with terror and leading to the gates of death. `White Teeth!' `Well what you say to him?' asked the youthful Indian who sat upon the deck as composed and indifferent as if he were crouched before his camp-fire. `It is a dreadful thing to die.' `Great Spirit take 'em up!' answered the lad, pointing above to the storm-dark skies. `Sun shine bright up top de clouds.' `Do you believe you will go up where the sun shines when you drown?' `Yes, me go up; Great Spirit give White Teeth wings—him fly up like 'em gull.' `Then you don't fear to die?' `No!' `I envy you—I wish I could say,' and the stout-hearted, wicked man groaned with the terror of an infant. `Poor May! I wish she was near to know my danger and pray for me!' Once more he looked around upon the scene of terror; he could gather no hope, —he knew well that no power could save the shallop in her tendency towards the reef; and that when she struck upon it she would be dashed into atoms, and death would be inevitable amid the battling surges—for there was not a rock or foot-hold above the breakers that the sea-bird could rest the sole of its foot on; all was chaos and horror to the eye—a dreadful uproar of appalling sounds to the ear. William Northrop, after once more looking round in despair, was about to cast himself upon the deck and submit to his fate, when his ear was arrested by the report of a cannon to leeward, and at the same moment the sky was lighted up by a rocket, to which was attached a blue light. Its appearance was singularly wild and magnificent, circling along amid the darkness of the storm, lighting up land and sea in its progress. By its light the cliff, and the group upon it, and the dismasted frigate, were plainly seen by him; while the illumination betrayed the position of the shallop to the spectators on board the ship. The surf-skiff was no where visible to their eyes or to those of George Hunnewell, who, taking advantage of the sudden light arching along the sky, rapidly sent his glances over the fierce ocean in search of the adventurous boat. A second rocket went up, and in its curving descent lighted up all the sea in the vicinity of the reef with the momentary brightness of noonday. By it Northrop saw all the horrors of his situation, but also beheld struggling with the waves on his larboard quarter a small black boat. He had to look a second time before he could believe his eyes; for it might have been a rock or a huge fish turning up to the light his dark back. `A boat!—me see 'em boat!' shouted the Indian boy. `Then I was not mistaken,' said Northrop, as the darkness once more returned. `It was in this direction?' `Yes—me see 'em, and two people.' `I could not see that much; God grant there may be no persons abroad in like peril with ourselves.' This was the noblest sentiment ever uttered by William Northrop; it showed that the near approach of death had stirred up the nobler elements of humanity within him. Another rocket went soaring up into the sky; for the skiff was not yet visible from the ship, on account of an intervening spur of the ledge. By its light Northrop caught another and distinct view of the life-boat, about two hundred yards to the northward and leeward, stretching across in a course between the shallop and the reef, on which the latter was driving beam-end first, every sea making a complete breach over her decks. `It is the life-boat!—thank God!' he cried, as he grasped the hand of the Indian boy, in his grateful emotion. The hope of life filled him with love for all living creatures; and so the Indian lad, to whom he had been a hard master, came to be an object of kindness. `Me see 'em—lightning show me woman in 'em!' `A woman! can it be that it is my daughter who has come out in it?' he cried, straining his eyes through the darkness that hung upon the sea to look for the boat. `Me see woman—squaw, sure! Me see 'em Tom—hump-back: rocket make 'em shine same as 'em sun. Me see 'em —good!' reiterated the Indian. `Then I have to fear for my child as well as for myself! She can never reach us—the course she takes will carry her directly upon the reef, even before we are dashed upon it. See! look sharply! —can't you see the boat through the gloom? I think I see it—the clouds light up a little.' `Me see em! Boat comin' fast!' `My eyes do not deceive me. I can discern it through the darkness. Let us shout! Hilloh, ho—hilloah! The life-boat, ahoy!' `It is my father!' cried May, who was tugging at two of the oars while Tom pulled at the other two. Manfully, brother! We are gaining every moment. Let us not despair. God will give us strength!' `For you, I do it, May. I would rather he should drown. He will beat me and call me hump and damned monster.' `No. He will always love you if you save him. Hear him shout! Answer him back with me! Mingle your voice with mine, for the wind blows hard and we have to shout against it.' `Rescue! Aid at hand!' she shouted back in a shrill, cheering cry, in which the deep tones of the dwarf's voice were mingled. `It is my child! God who has sent her to my aid will reward her filial love. We shall not perish, White Teeth!' `See 'em breakers. They roar to eat us up. We nebber see de land more,' said the Indian, quietly. `Surf-boat come to see us drown!' `You are right,' exclaimed the wretched man, with a shriek of despair, looking before them. While he had been directing his attention to the skiff he had been beedless of the shallop's rapid approach to the ledge, and now he saw that it had rapidly been driven towards a portion of it nighest, and where the waves leaped in mad revelry mast-head high and roared with appalling loudness. `There is no hope. She has come to see us perish and to perish with us!' he cried, looking towards the before hoped-for succor and wringing his hands. `Oh, God, I cannot die now and my child so near! Help! Save us! One minute more!' The life-boat was now within fifty feet of the shallop, which was tossed with the most fearful rapidity along the huge upheaving billows into the midst of a chaos of howling waters. A few yards further and she would be swallowed up and shattered into fragments, the surges tossing the bodies of the living men upon the sharp rocks or engulphing them in their depths. The soul of William Northrop shrank within him! He stood with stretched out arms, madly crying, `Come! Save your father, May! Oh, save me! Save me, or let me die with thee!' The voice of her father inspired the maiden with almost supernatural energy. Her words gave new vigor to the dwarf's arms, and the life-boat came riding upon the top of a wave astern of the shallop and was within twice her length when the shallop was lifted upon an enormous sea and tossed into the foaming vortex like a cockle-shell. It was heard crashing upon the rocks of the ledge and the wild waters went leaping and hissing over the ruins they had made. Ere the shallop was thus lifted up, and as he felt it rising upon the breakers, Northrop leaped into the surf as far as he could in the direction of the skiff, which was coming after the wreck. Tom had hesitated as he saw the shallop leaping into the air, and ceased pulling. `For your life and mine now, Tom!' she cried. `Onward, for it is death to turn back! See! There is my father! Save him! Grasp his arm as we drive by!' The dwarf caught sight of William Northrop and seized him by the shoulder, and, aided by the fearless May, drew him on board while the boat was actually driving into the midst of the wild surf. `Now may God speed us!' she cried. `There was another one! Look sharp!' But there was no other person seen, and the young girl having hastily fastened her lifeless father by cords to the boat so that the sea would not wash him overboard, seized an oar and, aided by Tom, began to pull for life against the fearful death which now menaced them; for the delay to rescue her father had already involved them in the chaos of waters that howled about the spurs of the breakers. CHAPTER XV. The Passage of the Reefs. The danger to which May was now exposed was most imminent. While she had been rescuing her father, the boat, left to the waves, had been thrown among the breakers, upon which it was wildly tossed. Both of them now began to row hard to escape being pushed upon the rocks. But they had become too far involved in the vortex of the surf, and May saw that their only hope lay in endeavoring to steer the boat over the ledge upon the summit of a wave; for there were huge billows rolling on that, having struck the rocks, overleaped them to the other side in mighty cataracts. She had no sooner conceived this way of safety, a forlorn hope indeed it seemed, than, bidding Tom to row with all his strength, she sprang to the stern and seized the fixed helm of the boat. All this while the sea was at one moment tossing the skiff almost into the air, and at another moment burying it in deep chasms; while the raging surf poured over it in torrents. Nothing but the net-guard which each had bound about their bodies, and which firmly held them in the boat, saved both of them from being dashed into the sea a dozen times. There was light enough upon the dan ger before them from the white foaming surges to enable her to feel that only a special Providence could carry her safely through the danger. Already the boat was in a situation in which any other would have been swamped; but her buoyancy and capability to resist every power that would operate to overset her, saved it. Although it was filled with water, it floated as lightly as a cork. We have been some minutes describing the situation of May; but the events passed with far greater celerity than we can record them. It was not fifty seconds after she had taken her father on board, before she was in the midst of the driving, snow-white surf, and deafened by the roar and almost blinded by the spray that nearly overwhelmed them with its force and density. She was, as we have already intimated, a skilful boat-woman, and had been more than once the instrument of saving lives perilled in a storm. She was also cool and feared not death; for the good and brave never fear death. Fear is the hand-maiden of a guilty conscience. May was one of those rare spirits that look only to duty; and when they see it before them, they take no thought of consequences. Therefore, at this moment, which would have shaken the stoutest heart, and which had made a woman of William Northrop, she was perfectly self-possessed. The dwarf was always the echo of his sister. He depended on her always, and so that she was fearless, he was also. May could see at a glance that her situation was one of extreme peril. To retrace the boat's course was impossible. They must either be dashed to pieces on the ledge, over which the sea was tumbling with terrific fury, or go safely over on the crest of some billow. For this opportunity she watched. Encouraged by her voice, Tom kept the boat back from the surges for a minute, when, seeing a billow rolling towards her, she shouted to the dwarf to back water to meet it. The wave caught up the skiff upon its foaming crest and carried it forward with resistless force towards the wall of reefs. The dwarf saw at once the danger and the safety, without any direction from his sister. By strong strokes he kept the boat backing upon the top of the wave; to keep it from being pitched over its range, while May steered it with unerring accuracy, keeping its bow directly forward in the course the wave was moving. It was a terrible moment. Life and death hung upon it. The huge billow on which they rode struck the ledge with a tremendous shock, over-leaping it high in the air, bearing the life-boat onward with lightning speed, amid a blinding cloud of spray. If the strength of the up-bearing wave had failed, or the rocks of the reef had covered a broader space, the boat would have dropped like an earthen vessel from between the hands, and been shivered to atoms upon the black, half-submerged ledge beneath. But the strength and power of the huge billows held it up, and — breathless moment!—carried it safely over the ledge, and cast it, shear downwards, into the foaming eddies leeward of the rocks. The boot went deep beneath the surface, and for an instant May believed that it would never rise more. But its buoyancy and peculiar construction, rendered it superior to the ordinary accidents of the sea, by which other boats have been destroyed. It threw off the superincumbent weight of water, and once more sought the surface. As soon as May could catch her breath, she instinctively caught the helm to direct the boat's head, knowing that it would be submerged by the next blllow, unless propelled to a distance from the ledge.— The dwarf, who had minded the immersion no more than a water-dog, at her voice, plied the locked oars, and the escaped skiff went bounding from the roaring surges behind it, as if conscious of its deliverance. In a few moments they were in a smoother sea, for the surf stretching across the mouth of the bay, like a sea wall, broke the fury of the waves. May's first emotion was gratitude to Heaven, for her wonderful escape through dangers so appalling; her next thought was of her father. He was no longer insensible as he was when taken on board, and placed under the net; for the life-boat was provided with small nets to throw over persons or goods, to save them from being washed into the sea again. The nets were provided with hooks which were hoooked into rings on the gunwales. Beneath this net William Northrop remained perfectly secure.— But the force of the billows which could not carry him back into the sea, restored him to consciousness, which he had lost by being struck in the breast by a fragment of his boat, just as the dwarf was reaching down to grasp him: He now sat up and said, though confusedly— `May, my child! Are we safe? Are you?' `Past all danger, dear father,' she cried, embracing him. `Are you hurt?' `No. I am well again,' he answered. `Unhook the cords! There will be no more sea to pass.' `No, sir. We are saved; you and I, and Tom. For a few moments I gave up all hope!' `Let me thank you for my life, my child,' he said, taking her hand as she unloosed the net-guard. `But for you, God knows where I should now have been!' `Think no more of the danger. God sent me to rescue you.' `I shall never forget this deed, May!' `Tom, too!' `Yes, and Tom, too. There, my boy, take my hand and forgive me all. I have treated you badly. I am sorry.' Tom gratefully grasped his father's hand, and kissed it passionately, his heart dissolved at once by the first kind tones he had ever heard from his lips; for William Northrop had hated his child from the first day of its birth, for its deformity. The surf-skiff was still moving swiftly up the bay before the gale, Tom's oars being now no longer necessary. May sat in the stern steering, holding her father's hand in her's; and refusing to let him steer, though he assured her that he was now `as good a man as ever.' Many expressions of gratitude to his child escaped his lips as he sat by her; and every little while he would look at Tom as he crouched in the bottom of the boat to escape the wind, which chilled him through his wet clothes, and say kindly, `Poor Tom! I have done thee wrong in thy day. I will atone for it after this.' `Yes, dear father, Tom has saved your life, not I!' she said warmly. `If he had refused to come, I could have done nothing.' `Tom is a good son. And did you know that it was the shallop? Could you see me from the cliff?' `Yes; by the lightning which lighted up all the sea like noon-day. Tom said it was you. My fears told me it was you, dear father; but, at all events, there was a fellow-being in danger; and I could not stand on shore in security and see him perish with the means to save.' `And so through your filial love and humanity you have saved your father's life, dear child!' `I am rewarded, sir!' she answered, with deep joyful emotion. `How is it you have been so long away, dear father?' `I was detained,' he answered, in a tone that showed he had rather the enquiry had not been made; `I hoped to have got into the bay before the storm reached us, or I should have run in behind White Island, as I ought to have done. But when I saw the little cloud in the west, I was not more than nine miles distant, and believed I should make the bay; but I never saw a tornado walk so fast as this did.' `It came on with terrible power; I had a misgiving that you were in it.' `It is my luck to loose vessels—here is the second I have lost in three months; and in losing the shallop I have been a greater loser than you suppose. But not now can I tell you how. The wind seems to be abating now—it has done its work on me and mine. Didn't I see a large ship dismasted running into the bay?' `Yes, sir—there it is,' she answered, pointing to the place where the frigate was anchored, about half a mile to windward of them. `I can see her; she looks very large, so far as I can make her out.' `She is an English frigate, I believe, sir.' `An English frigate!' repeated Northrop quickly, and starting with evident amazement. `She must have had a pilot; who could have run her in? I know of no fisherman who would do that service for an enemy's ship; and I don't think the frigate carries a pilot for every bay she may be driven into in a storm. It must be the Cœur de Lion, for I had intelligence she was on the coast hereabouts,' he added, in a half-musing tone. `I do not know whether it is or not, sir,' responded May; who did not care to make known to her father, after the free expression of his opinions, the agency of her lover in saving the ship. For an instant a painful thought passed across her mind, that George might have incurred a heavy responsibility by piloting the ship in, and that he might suffer. But she dismissed the thought, conscious that humanity and Heaven would defend him against all the malevolent aspersions of his fellows. For the rest of the passage across. May was silent, giving her attention to the guiding of the boat over the caressing waters, which now served to carry it forward rather than to menace it, as heretofore, with destruction. `We will not pass too near the frigate, child,' said Northrop, as he touched the helm and kept away a little. `We may be ordered on board: and my fair daughter is too sacred in my eyes to be made the gazing stock of the rude young officers. Keep away a little, May.' The boat passed some distance to the westward of the frigate and in full sight; for the dark clouds had been driving onward towards the north, bringing lighter and more broken ones, till objects could be seen indirectly, and even the dark line of the cliffs made out from the frigate's deck without the aid of the flashes of lightning. These grew less and less frequent, and the thunder rolled distinctly in the east, as if the storm had spent its power in that region, and was carrying devastation and death to other scenes. The wind also moderated, though still blowing with resistlesa power. Gradually as the life-boat neared the beach the storm lulled, and here and there a solitary star was visible in a breach in a thick mass of clouds. William Northrop and his daughter landed together while the dwarf remained to empty the water out of the boat, and carry it back whence he had taken it. The return of the boat in all its progress had been watched from the cliff by George and the English crew, and no sooner had May touched the beach than she was in his arms. She blushingly disengaged herself, though as overjoyed to see that he was safe as he was to find her so. George covered his warmth of meeting with May by a hearty and warm welcome of her father, though he did not fold the old man to his heart, or glue his lips to his. A few words between the lovers exylained the position and situation each had been in. Northrop did not look very kindly on the seven English sailors, and being told they were wrecked, he ordered Tom to take them on board their vessel in the life-boat. CHAPTER XVI. The Old Man and the Youthful Pilot. The old gsherman, Northrop, seemed relieved as soon as the men embarked; and George had noticed that he kept his features concealed by turning his head from them, and that he hastened up the path as rapidly as he could. `Your father is rather inhospitable towards the English sailors,' said George. `Yes. He does not much like the English ever; and especially in war.' `He seemed to avoid them in a very marked manner, as if he feared to be recognised. Did you observe this!' `Yes. But don't let us speak of this, George. We have ourselves to talk about; and we have God to thank for the safety of this night!' `We have every thing to be grateful for, dearest May. As we walk up I will tell you how things went on board the frigato. When he had ended his narrative, which took him, slow as they walked arm in arm, till they got quite to the top of the cliff, he demanded of her an account of her dangerous enterprize; and when she described her danger amid the surf, he shuddered and caught her to his heart. `You seem to have been brought to life from the dead, dearest May. But you are safe, and I am happy. You have no idea of the anguish I have suffered the last three hours, pacing up and down this cliff-top in the storm, which I felt not, watching the sea for you. I knew you were battling with the elements, and felt my own impotency without a boat to go and share with you the dangers you voluntarily encountered. I can hardly realise that I once more see you in safety—fold you to my heart in hope and joy!' `I trembled for you, George, when I saw you going towards the frigate, and the storm so close upon you. I more than once repented of my wish to have you go, and when I fancied, as I did for a little time, that you had been caught by the tornado and had perished, I felt that I should always look upon myself as your murderer.' `In your cause, for your sake, dearest May, I would willingly have met death. And how did you know that I escaped?' `By watching the frigate's movements in the midst of the hurricane. I watched her until she came near Porpus Ledge, and saw her tack and stand westward; and then I knew that you were guiding her destiny.' `Sweet May, the consciousness of your thoughts and prayers being with me; the anticipation of your love when I should return to you successful, gave me courage, coolness, and skill even superiar to myself. Your spirit seemed to stand by my side, and bid me be calm and strong, and fear not.' `I was by you, George. My heart was more in the ship with you than in my own bosom. It was while lingering over you at the helm, in your pathway through the storm, that I beheld the shallop contending with the winds and waves in the offing. You know the result.' `Brave and generous May,' he said, pressing her hands in his. `Now, as humanity makes no more demands upon you to-night, for the hurricane has subsided into a smart gale only, you had best seek your pillow. You need repose.' `Not more than you, George?' `I will throw myself down on the floor in your father's room; for he will doubtless need sleep after the extraordinary fatigues of the night. To-morrow, love, we will again see each other, I will dream of you and of my happiness.' They were now at the door of the cottage. William Northrop was already inside, removing his wet jacket for a drier. May said a few words of affection to her faer, and then, at his reiterated desire, sought her couch; but she did not retire so secretly that George did not meet her in the entry and steal from her lips a sweet good night. How pure and innocent was that love. He then entered the room where William Northrop sat, smoking a pipe which he had just lighted. He was thinking of his escape, of his daughter's courage and affection; and trying to lift his heart to God for his goodness in permitting him to live. He knew not how to pray, that man of a wicked life. He could only sit and smoke, and try to make his heart move with thankfulness. But May knew the path of prayer often trod by the feet of her pure spirit. She had no sooner closed the door than she knelt, dripping as her garments were with the salt-sea spray, by her little bed, and raising her seraphic countenance to Heaven, with eyes beaming faith and love, thanked God her Father for his great mercies to herself, to her father, and to George. William Northrop's gratitude went up in smoke and was as substantial and abiding; but hers was written down by the golden pen of the recording angel. George, too happy to talk, threw himself upon the floor, simply saying:— `Good night, master William.' He wished to lay and think of May, so long hopelessly loved, now fairly won and his own for ever. Oh, what joy to the good to be loved by the pure and beautiful. `Who was the pilot of that ship, George?' asked Northrop, as the lover lay dreaming, awake, of May. `She had a pilot I am sure, or she would not have been where she is now.' As William Northrop said this, he knocked the ashes from his pipe, and replaced it in his lips. `It was I, sir,' answered George. `You? Do you mean to say that you piloted that ship in?' cried Northrop, in a loud, angry tone of surprise. `Yes, sir,' answered George, firmly. `I have been thinking who on the coast was traitor enough to have done it. And so you are he?' thundered the fisherman, rising up. `Stand on your feet, and let me look at you.' George was already upon his feet, surprised at the violent manner of the old man. He was also struck by his expression of `traitor.' He turned pale, and a strange feeling passed over him. `What harm was there, sir, in tacking the ship in?' he said calmly. `She was in peril; and her signals guns were firing an hour before I started.' `Let them fire. She was an enemy. It would have been a service to have let her be wrecked.' `I did not think of her being an enemy so much as I—' Here he stopped full. He was about to continue `as I thought 5 of May's wishes.' But he recollected in good time that her father never liked his visits to her; and had better be kept in ignorance in his present mood of her influence over him. Besides, he feared if he mentioned her name he might visit her with that anger which he saw gathering against himself. He therefore terminated his answer with—`as I thought of the duties of humanity!' `Humanity!' repeated William Northrop, with a sneer. `You have done work this night, young man, that you ought to swing for!' `I have saved the lives of five hundred human beings, Master William,' answered George, firmly. `I do not think I can be censured for this.' `We shall see!' responded the old man with significant emphasis. `We shall see! How came that boat wrecked with the English sailors I found on the beach?' he demanded, moodily. `In bringing me off!' `What became of your own boat?' `It was swamped along side when I went on board!' `Did you take any one with you?' `Buttermilk!' `Humph! Two of you! very well. What did the English Captain pay you?' `He offered me money but I refused all recompense!' `You did!' repeated Northrop, looking him in the face with surprise. `Yes; I believe the black took something.' `And so you piloted this English ship of war into the bay for love!' he said, sarcastically. `Yes, sir, for love,' responded George, with peculiar emphasis, and a slight smile upon his fine face. `It was your duty to have wrecked her on the Porpus!' `And lost my own life, Master William!' `You had better have been drowned than hanged, as you are liked to be!' `Hanged, Captain Northrop?' exclaimed George, starting at the word with indignation not unmixed with alarm; for he was young and ignorant of the laws of the land; and did not know but that his having piloted the ship in would would bring his head into peril. `Yes, young man. The ship is, you say, an English frigate! You knew it to be such when you heard her signals. You went knowingly on board of her; and you piloted her, an enemy's ship, safely into the bay; when without your aid she would have been lost!' `There is little doubt of that, sir. I feel sure she would have been wrecked. If I have done wrong, I still have the satisfaction of knowing that I have saved the lives of half a thousand men!' `Here are your countrymen killing Englishmen every day wherever they can meet them, and you are risking your own life to save an English ship containing five hundred of them; and preserving her and them to do us an injury!' `I am sorry, sir,' answered George, `that I have done wrong. But I cannot undo what is done!' His conscience now showed him plainly that the old man's words were based on truth. He had, as the reader will remember, opposed going on board in the outset, advancing precisely similar arguments to May. But love had over-ruled his patriotic prejudices. He now felt that he was guilty of the very thing which Northrop charged him with; and was not entirely free from apprehensions of the result. `But if I suffer, it will be sweet to know it was for May's sake!' he said, cheerfully. `You can undo what you have done, young man!' said William Northrop, coming close up to him as he stood leaning against the wainscoating by the door, and speaking in an under tone and in a very impressive manner. `How?' cried George Hunnewell, with eagerness. `The ship is dismasted in port. It will take her two or three days, or more, to refit. She will then want a pilot out!' `Yes, sir!' `Don't you understand me?' `I do not know that you mean anything more than I hear, Master William.' `You are very dull, or see fit to be so. The frigate, I say, will want a pilot out!' `I would not pilot her. I was asked and refused to do it!' `You must do it! You must go on board and offer to do it!' `You but now have accused me, as also my conscience almost has done, of being a traitor by piloting the frigate in!' `Your only course is now to pilot her out and redeem your folly in bringing her in, by wrecking her on the Porpus ledge!' `Wreck her, sir!' `Yes. It is your only course to avoid the consequences that will otherwise follow you!' `I will not be a party to such a crime, sir,' answered George, with a kindling eye. `I am ashamed to have any man believe that I could do such a deed. It is not in me, Master William Northrop. I am not the man!' `You are not. Very well. You will have to take the consequences!' `I am willing to abide the result of what I have done,' he answered, firmly. As the storm seems to be passing off, and the sky is clear in the west, I will try and reach home across the hills. Good night, Master Northrop!' `Good night. To-morrow I hope you will think better of my suggestion.' `I can give you no other answer than that I have already made,' answered the young man, as he left the room and passed out of doors. The wind still blew high but the clouds had been driven eastward, and lay piled up near the horizon in vast black masses, from which the far-off lightning gleamed, and the low muttering thunder came. Over-head all was star-bright; and the moon two hours high was struggling through a squadron of white clouds, the rear-guard of the storm. CHAPTER XVII. The Indian Messenger. During the succeeding three days the weather had been bright and clear, and the English frigate had succeeded in setting a mizzen-mast complete, with all her top-hamper, and in rigging a jury-main-mast. She could obtain no spar, and had none on board large enough for a new mast. By going on shore, and cutting down a white pine, which the Captain at first thought of doing, he might have completely refitted his vessel; but this would consume too much time, and he was anxious to get away with such repairs as he could make before the rumor of his situation should be conveyed o Boston, where he knew an American frigate and gun-brig lay. That such information would be at once conveyed the morning after the storm, he had no doubt whatever; and he was anxious to be at sea again, on his way to Halifax, to complete his refit. He was not out in his conjectures. By the early dawn of the morning after the storm a messenger was on his way to Boston Bay, in a canoe rigged with a sail. The messenger was an Indian, the uncle of young White Teeth. William Northrop had early sought his hut, about a mile in the depths of the forest, by the side of a fresh-water lake. The old chief, for chief he had been in the day when his tribe was numerous and strong, and he still looked the old warrior, was on the alert at the door of his camp, clearing his rifle preparatory to the day's hunt. `Hooh! Who goes?' he called as he caught a glimpse, through the dusk of the morning, of Northrop's figure in the narrow woodland path; and the brought his rifle to his shoulder, though it was evidently unloaded. `It is me, William.' `Good. Come to camp. How you do? Yo bin go way moosh times!' `Yes. I got back last night,' answered Northrop, seating himself on a log to rest, for the walk had been long, and his combat with the waves the night before had weakened him, so that he was not yet half the strong man he was when himself. `Where, boy?' asked the chief, winding a piece of dried grass about the screw of his ram-rod and thrusting it into the muzzle of his gun. `Boy turn up by and by. I come to see you, Natanah, not about your boy, but on great business.' `Great business. Good! Boy be home by'm by.' `Yes, and by,' answered Northrop, who did care to introduce the unpleasant information of his loss, lest he should not get him to attend so promptly to the service he had in view for him. `There is a King's ship in the bay.' `In you' bay, Will'm?' asked the Indian, amazed. `Yes—a big war-ship. She was driven in last night by the storm. She will remain two or three days to repair dam ages.' `Me sell 'em some game. Me get much bukash—much monies.' `I will give you more money than you can ever get by selling them game, if you do as I wish. Besides, it will be a crime to sell to the enemy.' `What Will'm say to Natanah?' `He wants you to take your canoe and start at once, this hour, this moment, and strike across the Casco Bay, and so up the harbor to Portland. You will reach there before night. You will at once go to the officer in commrnd of the forces there, and give him this tobacco-box.' As he spoke, he placed in the Indian's hand an old oval japanned box that was fastened by a clasp. `This box contains a letter to him, telling him the English ship is here, and telling him to despatch an express to Boston to the commander of the frigate there.' `Good. Now what bukkeesh you give Indian if he go?' asked the wiley and money-loving savage. `I will give you twenty silver dollars and two jugs of rum when you come back.' The Indian's eyes sparkled with pleasure. `Give Natanah five doller before, and he go.' `Done. Now hasten to your boat and be as secret as the wind in a calm day.' `Natanah true man good,' responded the Indian impressively, placing his hand on his heart. `I can trust you. Where is your canoe?' `At the rock.' `Go, then, at once. I will walk with you to your canoe, and see you start.' The Indian returned into his hut, and bringing forth a blanket and jug, and a bunch of squirrels and a few birds, with which he had an eye to a market in the city, he flung his rifle across his arm, and shutting the lodge, walked away to the left by a path just discernible. Northrop followed him steadily for about a mile, when they came to the sea-shore, where a narrow inlet made up into the land. The sun was rising as they descended to the beach, and flinging far and wide his golden splendor over ocean, isle and main. `The sea rolls high yet, Natanah!' he said, looking over the scene, now magnificently contrasting the stormy night. `Yiss, Will'm. Indian canoe not mind him. Plenty bukeesh come by'm by.' `There is not any more wind than would fan a lady. Keep well out to avoid the surf there on Gull Point Reef; it rolls and tumbles there as if it would keep it up for twenty-four hours more.' The Indian was now busily launching his birch canoe, which was concealed in a larch thicket, above the highest flow of the sea. It was so light, that he carried it on his shoulder and placed it in the water. He now put in his jug, his blanket, and rifle, and then delayed to grasp Northrop by the hand in token of faithfulness, and to ask him for the boy. `The boy will be safe enough till you come back. Think only of what you have to do. `When you reach the city, make no stop—touch no whiskey—speak to no man; but hasten to the General in command, and place the box in his hand.' Natunah promised to do this, and sprung into his boat, and raised its little gossimer like sail. He turned its bow from the shore, and seating himself in the centre with his paddle, glided rapidly away from the land, the sail filling and stretching out far ahead of him. The waves yet rolled heavily, but the light bark danced over them with a swift and joyous motion, and each moment lessened to the eye of the old fisherman. It steered for a passage between two islands which lay to the west, and after passing these, was to wind its way among the numerous isles of the great Bay of Casco, till it should reach its destination twenty four miles distant. Northrop now turned away, satisfied that the message was safely on its way, and began to follow a path over the height of land which soon brought him in full sight of the frigate at anchor in his bay; for the inlet from which the Indian had set sail was westward farther, and separated from it by the promontory that formed the western arm of Northrop's Bay. The deck of the frigate was already in bustle. Shears were being rigged, and every thing preparing to refit. She was a noble looking ship, with her dark, warlike hull, and battlements of cannon. There was no flag at her fore-top, to designate her nation; and Northrop attributed the absence of it, to a desire to be as little auspicious as possible. He stood some minutes watching the ship, and then made his way towards his cottage. Near it he was met by May, who on seeing him ran to embrace him. `Dear father, how thankful I ought to be, that I have been the instrument of your safety. I could scarcely realise, when I awaked this morning, that all was not a dream. `How fares it with you, child, after the fatigues of the night?' he ask in a kindly tone. `Well, sir. I do not feel them at all. I am so glad you have spoken pleasantly to Tom. He is the happiest of the happy!' `Poor witless wretch!' `No, father—he is not a wretch. He is not witless. He has a large heart, and feels every kindness, as well as any act of hostility. A word makes him an enemy—a word makes him a friend!— I hope, father, you will never speak harshly to him again.' `I will not. He has done me good service. But I never supposed that the dwarf had any feeling,' answered Northrop coarsely. `He is as sensitive as a child. He is all feeling, father. I can tell him a child's tale and make him weep; and I can relate to him a deed of cruelty, and he is roused into ferocity of indignation. He would be faithful to you and useful, if you would have confidence in him.' `I will see what I can make of him. I have something to say to you touching another than Tom.' `Who is it, sir?' she asked, blushing as if she half guessed who he meant. `It is George Hunnewell,' he answered, in a tone as if he did not like the person, whose name he uttered. May started and turned pale. She began to fear at once that her father had heard that George had piloted the ship in, and that he was angry at it; because she knew his deep hatred for the English, even before the war. `What of him, sir?' `He is a traitor! What was he doing here last night talking apart with you.— I noticed it: for I never let you escape me when I am with you. I see and hear all. He acted like a lover. You treated him as if he were one, and one well liked too! How is this that the wind has changed so, since I went away from home ten days ago?' `He, that is sir—I—I mean to say that George has —' `I see how it is. Your embarrassment is more eloquent than any confession of your love. But, you shall not see him again. If I opposed his tender visits to you once, I will do it now, for I will have no traitor to be a son-in-law of mine!' `He is not a traitor, sir!' she answered warmly. `He piloted the English frigate into the harbour.' `And therefore he deserves the appellation of the friend of humanity.' `So! The tide flows this way, does it?' he said, in a deep voice of displeasure. `You love this young man, then, and approve too of his treachery.' `Father, if there is treason, I alone am to blame!' she answered earnestly. `You?' `Yes, dear father. It was at my request—my earnest entreaty, that he went out to the aid of the frigate. Voluntarily he would not have gone; for he believed that it would be a wrong for which he could be punished by his country. This he said to me. But I assured him that it would rather be regarded as an act of humanity. I urged him to go. I removed his objections and he embarked. If he has incurred the censure of men, I alone am to blame, father.' `You shall never take the blame on yourself, child. I am amazed at this! The young man has done an act that will hang him.' `It cannot. It was a noble act. He would have deserved death had he stood on the cliff, and permitted the frigate to go to pieces! He has done no wrong, sir; nor have I, in urging him to do what he did!' `May never speak again to a human being of your part and agency, if you love me or heed my commands.' `I obey you, sir, only so long as my silence does not cause any evil to befall George!' `I command you to be silent without any condition. George Hunnewell must take care of himself.' `Father, I cannot be silent and George come to harm! If he is to be blamed I must also speak.' `He shall not come to harm. Let the matter rest between us,' he said, suddenly changing his manner to one of kindness. `Speak of it to no one else. I will maybe pass it by.' `I trust so,' she answered, with a sad smile, as if still feeling that some evil to her lover might yet come out of it. Her father now left her and went down to the beach, while she re-entered the cottage to prepare breakfast. CHAPTER XVIII. The Pilot. The third afternoon after the storm found the British frigate ready for sea, at least so far as it was possible to refit her in the bay. Her commander had been three or four times on shore during the interval, and had visited the cottage of William Northrop; but this man always kept out of the way, carefully avoiding being seen by him. May offered to the English officer, with a grace and courtesy which charmed every one, the hospitalities of her humble home; and when the officers spoke of George, the young pilot, and asked about him, and praised him, and told how he had refused money for his services, her maidenly cheek was enriched with the sweet blushes of pleasure. Indeed, so apparent was her interest in the young fisherman, that Captain Howard Morpeth felt satisfied she was his betrothed. On the afternoon on which the ship prepared to go to sea, the captain was again on shore. He went to the house alone, and seeing May in the door, the parrot perched upon her wrist, he lifted his cap in homage to her beauty, and said, `I have called, fair maid, to bid you good by, and to beg you will accept this little gift, in testimony of your hospitality.' `I thank you, sir, but I can take nothing from you. I have done only what my heart has prompted. You owe me nothing, sir.' `Very well; if you will not accept the bracelet, Poll, your favorite, shall.' With this he fastened upon the emerald enamelled neck of the Parrot the rich bracelet which he had displayed to her eyes. May smiled at the act and the manner in which he did it, but said nothing either in assent or dissent. `There,' said the captain to the bird, `wear that for your fair mistress, unti she shall one day relent and rob you of it.' `How's the wind! Sail ho!' chattered the Parrot, in a shrill, self-confident tone, that made both the captain and May laugh. `Ah, you here, black?' said the captain, as Buttermilk came forward. `Where is young master?' `Massa Jorge?' `Yes. I want him to pilot me out.' `He nebber do dat, massa. 'Sides massa Jorge aint at home. He been gone, gone away ebber since yesterday aternoon.' `George gone?' exclaimed May with surprise, and turning pale. `Where?' `Don't know, Missus. 'Spect he only keep out ob de way till de frigate gone.' `Then you must pilot me out, my man,' said the captain looking dissatisfied, for he had come on shore hoping to prevail on his young pilot to take the frigate to sea. `What massa captain pay?' asked the subtle African. `I will give you twenty guineas to take the frigate a league beyond the head lands of the bay.' `Done, massa,' responded Buttermilk. `I take my skiff along too, to come back in.' `Yes. Will you go on board now?' `D'rectly,' answered Buttermilk, and he went round to the rear of the cottage, and entering a boat-shed, removed a flat stone, beneath which he had deposited his gold. He looked at it minutely to see if it was all there undisturbed, and then replaced the stone.' `Dat ere gold safe. It a big nice nest egg for massa Jorge some day when he get poor man. He nebber know it now; but it do him some good sometime.' He had no sooner dropped the stone than he saw Tom approaching. `Ah, Tom dear, I hope is better?' `I am well, Milk. The hard row that night of the storm had like to have killed Tom.' `You speaks as you hab a berry heabby cold now. I hope it aint de 'fluenza.' `Are you going to pilot the frigate out?' Yes. Me niggah citizen. Me no American. Same to Buttermilk English or American. White men al like to Buttermilk. Captain pay me yeller gold.' `If I acted as pilot of that frigate I would beach her on the Porpus.' `Dat would be wicked. I nebber do such ting as dat. I get her out safe, if I say so, Tom. Dat work ony fit for de debble heself.' `You shall not pilot her. Father says I may.' `I see you hab mischief in your eye. No, no, Tom; me pilot her safe.' `You must wreck her if you go on board,' said the dwarf, firmly. `No, nebber do dat. Can't be wicked: bad like dat. Nebber, nebber,' answered the negro, shaking his head. `Very well. Stay here a moment.' Tom left him, and passing into the house, called in a low tone to his father, who was concealed in the surf-boat, so that he could see and hear all that passed beneath him, The English captains words had not missed his ear, at any time he had been at the house. Secure in his covert, he watched all that transpired. The officer had shaken hands with May with friendly politeness, and departed, asking her to send the negro down to the beach. William Northrop on seeing Tom enter, rose and met him on the ladder which led to the loft. `He refuses to wreck her, father,' said Tom. `Then you must go on board in his place.' `Will you give your consent then?' `Yes; if you do it handsomely on the part of the reef I told you.' `You promise, without any change of mind, that if I wreck the frigate, father, you will not complain against brave George.' `It is your only way to save him from being strung up.' `And you promise that he shall marry May, too.' `I promise both,' answered Northrop with a resolute tone, `and I assure you that if you fail or falter you shall die by my hand.' `Then I will do it. The officer has gone down to the beach. Buttermilk is in the boat-shed.' `I will have him secure in a moment. He will find it better for him to have done as we wished. Go at once after the captain, and tell him that you are to take the black's place. Tell him the negro could not be trusted; as in truth he cannot by us.' The dwarf hastened through the entry to go on his mission of crime, while William Northrop went to the shed. Here he could find nothing of the negro; and after searching around some time, returned to the house; but cautiously, for fear that he might be seen by some of the English officers, whom he every moment carefully kept hid from. `Where are you going, Tom?' asked May, seeing him come out; for she had been to the verge of the cliff to look for a sail, which she had heard several voices say was in sight. She had discovered it in the western board close under the island called Nettle Rock, and about twelve miles distant. `I am going to pilot the frigate out,' answered Tom. `I thought Buttermilk was going to do this.' `No; he wont wreck her.' `Won't what?' `Wont wreck her on the Porpus.' `And do you mean to do this?' `To be sure I do.' `What do you mean, brother? Who has set you up to this black deed?' she cried with horror. `Who? Love for you, May, and for George, who loves you?' he answered bluntly. `Love for me! How can this be?' she asked, perplexed. `Why you know Geerge 'll be hanged for getting her in safe!' answered Tom, very positively. `I do not know any such thing.' `Well, if you don't, I do. The old man was so mad he swore up and down he would have him complained of, if only to prevent his having you for his wife.' `When did my father say this?' `To-day, and yesterday, and day before. Now he says that if I will pilot the ship and wreck her on the Porpuses, he 'll let George marry you, and wont complain to the government.' `Did he speak so?' `Yes; and he says it's the only way to save George's neck for me to wreck the frigate.' `And you resolve to do it?' `Yes; because I know you love George and that George loves you. I'd wreck fifty frigates so you might be mar ried to him and to keep him from coming to harm! Don't stop me. The boats are ready to go on board.' May was in a painful position. She feared to detain her brother, lest she should anger her father, whose vengeance she feared. She trembled to let him go on his message of death. She knew not what to do. That George had placed himself in a critical situation by bringing in the frigate, she had already began to be convinced; but the idea of saving him from the consequences, and of securing her father's consent to her union with him, by permitting such a wholesale murder as her father contemplated, was not to be entertained for an instant. The thought of it froze her blood with horror. `Tom, where is my father?' `Here!' responded William Northrop, coming forward from behind a group of trees from which he had satisfied himself that the officers and crew were all on the beach below, and would not be likely to ascend again. `Here, May! and I am here to forbid you to detain your brother. He has my orders!' `He shall not go and do this iniquitous thing, dear father!' she said firmly, but with a cheek as colourless as marble. `Then the consequences be upon you, and if George Hunnewell swings for what he has done, thank yourself. You urged him to do what he did and now that you can save him, you hesitate. Out upon such love as your's for him!' `Father, I am yet to learn that George is in peril.' `That you may be sure of. I have this day seen an officer from Bath who has come hither on purpose to arrest him.' `At whose information?' she asked with grief and indignation. `Not at mine! The rumor went on the winds, bearing intelligence of the reasonable aid rendered by the young man to every ear. That very frigate has for weeks shut the mouth of the Kennebec and ruined the commerce of its towns. That very frigate has captured no less than twenty-seven vessels, and impressed half their crews, making prisoners of the residue. That very frigate, saved from wreck and turned loose again upon the ocean to plunder the defenceless seamen, would have landed troops at Wiscasset and fired and laid waste the town and country, but for the gathering of force to defend the place. This dangerous vessel your lover, George Hunnewell, has involuntarily rescued from shipwreck that was inevitable. It is not as if he had been taken from a fishing-boat at sea and compelled to pilot her in. This would have been a different affair altogether. But he left the land and rowed out to her of his own free will. What more could an English fisherman have done? What more could the foullest traitor have done!' `Poor George!' `Already the land has branded him with the appellation of traitor. Already his name is ringing from tongue to tongue, from Maine to the central capital of the country. You may well cover your face, girl, and groan `poor George!' `Father, oh is this so?' `Is it so? I tell you what is truth.' `What can save him? Oh, tell me, for I am alone to blame!' `Silence, and never say that of yourself again. It will do no good to him, and only commit yourself, and perhaps bring mischief upon you. I offered him safety, but he refused it.' `How? In what way?' `That he should pilot the frigate out again and undo what he had so foolishly done.' `By wilfully wrecking her?' `Yes.' `And he refused safety on these terms?' `He did.' `Noble George! Had he accepted it, sir, I should have spurned him.' `Very well. If heroism is better than life, let him have his choice.' `And you would now send Tom—my poor brother, to do this deed?' `Yes. See! While I talk with you here, he is already on the beach. Stay! You cannot prevent him. It is too late. The boat is already off with him. If you call and tell them not to trust him, they will kill him for his treachery!' `What can I do?' she cried, clasping her hands in agony. `God protect the ship from the evil meditated. Oh, father, this desire to destroy the ship is not for love of George!' `No. It is a deadly hatred of the English. I would have offered myself as pilot, but that I feared my face might be known on her deck by some one. But Tom will do as well. He believes he serves you and George by it; and this notion in his head, you could get him to blow up the globe itself.' CHAPTER XIX. The Strange Sail. The maiden stood amazed with grief and anger. She felt that there was no safety now for the ship, but in the interposing providence of God. `You have no right, sir, to take advantage of my brother's love for me, to make him do this great crime.' `I will answer you in your own words. Did you not take advantage of George Hunnewell's love for you, to make him pilot that ship in?' `Father, you speak of George,' she said, suddenly. `Where is he? I heard the negro say that he had not been at home since last evening. He said that he had hid to escape going pilot in the frigate.' `I don't know what has become of him,' answered William Northrop, without looking her in the face. `Doubtless he is hid at some of the Indian camps.' `If he did not wish to pilot the ship, there was no body to compel him. It can't be for this he has absented himself. —I fear that some evil has happened to him!' `There goes the frigate's gun, the signal for sailing,' exclaimed her father, as if not wishing to reply to her question.— `See how the convass unfolds itself like great white wings, and spreads its volumes upon the air. The wind is a strong eight knotter, and will give her a firm headway for Tom's purpose.' `Oh, horrible. Father, save them.' `It is too late were I so inclined. But I would never stretch out a hand to save all the English in England from perishing. Ha! there is a sail in the west.— Square-rigged and large. Now this is my man for a hundred.' `What man?' `An American frigate. Three days ago I dispatched Natanah to Portland to give immediate information of the situation of the ship in the bay here; and letting the authorities know what an easy prize she would be. That vessel is the ready response.' The strange sail had also been discovered from the ship, and the preparations for getting under weigh were hastened. In a few minutes the frigate moved slowly from her anchorage, and with the sun shining brightly upon her blood-red flag, moved down the bay. `That is an American frigate,' said the fisherman. `I can't be mistaken now. She comes on at a slapping pace. I begin to feel sorry that I ordered Tom to wreck her. I should like to have seen an action between them. But the American will only come up to find her enemy going to pieces on the rocks.' `Oh, horrible!' cried May, with deep emotion. `See! The English vessel hauls the wind. What is this manœuvre. She is tacking and running back to her moorings. What can this mean? I see now. She is satisfied that she cannot help coming to action if she runs out, (for by this time they can make out with their glass what the stranger is,) and so seeks shelter in the bay, trusting to its difficult entrance. She would rather be blockaded than risk a fight with her imperfect repairs. That is it, depend on it.' `Then I am rejoiced. Tom cannot have an opportunity of wrecking her.' `No; but the American, if he has a pilot, will come closely in and attack her, whenever she can lay her aboard.— See how gallantly the Yankee frigate marches on.' The interest of the scene was naturally increasing. The American frigate was about four miles off, when she displayed her colours, and fired a gun to leeward. The Englishman took no notice of it, but running up the bay came to anchor with springs on her cables, farther in shore than she had been anchored before, and close under the cliff, leaving a shoal between her position and any direct approach abeam. Here, full in sight of Northrop, May and the Indian, who had joined them, they prepared for action and desperate resistance. The American came abreast of the harbour, and signalized, as Northrop supposed, for a pilot. `I will answer that,' cried Northrop. `Stay, father. There goes another signal, and a gun is fired. It may not be for a pilot, for she is again standing in!' `You are right. It was a challenge for the Englishman to come out. John Bull remains doggedly silent. Now, my girl, we shall look down upon the first fight ever our eyes beheld.' `Not mine. I could not bear to see men slay each other. Oh, that peace would reign here this day, instead of war!' `That American ship has a pilot, May, and one who knows the channel as well as he does the way to his mouth. See how he hugs the bold rock, and now luffs to pass the little Egg shoal, which has not a buoy to mark it, and can only be known by the best pilots. Look at that sudden keeping away as she turns the head-land. The channel there is hardly broader than the frigate's beam, and she keeps it as if it was fenced out for her. I would lay you a wager that the man who is at that helm, was born and raised about this bay. I know of but one person who could take a ship in so, as this one is walking in.' `And he—' `Is old Hunnewell, the uncle of young George. But he is blind now, and good for nothing. Now watch her double the Porpus ledge. That was done just as I should have done it!' `In the same way George brought the English frigate in!' `It was a bad way for him as he will find ere he grows older. If I did not know better I should say he was in that Yankee frigate, with his hand upon her helm. But it can't be?' `Can't be? You speak as if you knew where George is?' `I don't know.' `Then why may it not be he? We know not where he is.' `He couldn't very well have gone to Boston and now come down in her since yesterday afternoon, when they say, he was at home. He did not know the ship was coming to hunt up the Englishman. I did not trust him with the secret, lest he should blab!' `He should never have breathed it, sir. This is a difficult matter, father.— George would sacredly have kept the secret. To have betrayed the knowledge of it to the English captain and given him an opportunity te escape, that would have been treason. George is incapable of any such treachery. To save, an enemy's ship from wreck in a storm is one thing, and to warn her of an enemy's approach is another. You wronged him, sir. I helieve if George had known that this frigate was coming, he would have gladly gone on to Boston, and came down in her to pilot her in.' `Nay, sir, he would not have hesitated, after he had got the English ship into port in safety, and so done his duty in that point, to have been the messenger to bring the American ship down upon her to capture her.' `If he had done so, he might have saved himself from the fate that is likely to be his.' `Sir, you know something of him. You speak mysteriously. What meaning lies beneath that dreadful look?' `I know nothing about him; at least, I can't talk now. I am too busy watching these ships. We shall have a fair fight of it. See how the English make ready on their deck! They mean to make a desperate resistance. The American is her equal in guns and men. See how gallantly she comes into the bay, with royals aloft and topsails on the caps. She is taking in sail, and means to take the matter coolly. There goes up her fighting flag; and see the flash! She fires a gun to leeward in defiance. Hark! the shot has struck the cliff directly above the frigate's stern. There will be warm work soon down there, Natanah!' `Hoogh! Yes. White man make blood plenty now. Big fight by'm bye. Me bring dat ship.' `Oh, what a dreadful stillness! it is awful to see that noble ship come on so charged with death,' said May. `I cannot look longer.' `Courage, girl,' said William Northrop, his face beaming with warlike animation. `I would give all I am worth to be in the melee. Look on and see now. They will soon come to the muzzle. But I would like to know who is at the helm of that ship!' The American was now within half a mile of the English frigate, and as she was advancing she was clewing up and getting ready for action. She stood on past the Englishman's beam, and then tacked just where she should to avoid and pass inside of the shoal, beyond which the Cœur de Lion had anchored. `Now the man that is at the helm of that frigate is either George Hunnewelt or the devil in his shape.' `It is George! I know him even at this distance!' almost shrieked May Fawn. `I do believe it is he and no one else,' answered Northrop with a look of amazement, which, as his opinion became confirmed by a closer survey, changed into displeasure. `They have deceived me, the villains!' he uttered. `Here, when I supposed he was safe in the Bath jail, I find him piloting the American frigate in and bringing her up in line of battle with the very English frigate for saving which I had hoped to have had him hanged.' May waved her hand and her scarf to the frigate, and saw with tears of joy that her signal was seen and answered by George. It was indeed her lover, and by his side was also recognised the Indian lad, `White Teeth.' We will now show the reader, as in duty bound, how they both came there. William Northrop's hostility to him has already been seen. He had never spoken kindly to him since he first saw that he came to the cottage to visit his daughter. He opposed his suit for her hand and treated him rudely. He forbade him to visit the bay or speak to May in any place. The maiden had always liked George, and felt pleased whenever he came to see her. But still she did not return his passion with that warmth which he looked for. Indeed, she disguised her real feelings, which were kindly, under an air of pretty coquettry. She did not wish to be too proud and too happy all at once. But the storm and the danger of the English frigate, as we have seen, created a revolution in her feelings; and the price of her love became the safety of the endangered ship. When Northrop, after his rescue, saw how rapidly affairs had ripened, his bitterness against the young man was increased. It made but little difference with William Northrop whether George Hunnewell had piloted an English or a Dutch ship into the bay and saved her, though he would gladly the Englishman should have perished. But he saw that by taking advantage of this act of the young man's, he could have him arrested as a traitor, and so for ever removed from the presence of May. There was no particular reason why he should dislike George more than any others of the smart young fishermen who had set their caps for May; only that he was the most successful one, The truth was, William Northrop was so jealous of his daughter's love, that he feared to have her affections turned upon any one save himself. She was all he loved on earth; and he was resolved that he should be all that she loved. This was the secret of his hatred to George. The day after the escape of the frigate in so masterly a manner, William Northrop walked over to the cabin where George lived. He found him reposing after the great fatigues he had passed through. He had a short interview with him, in which he urged him to pilot the frigate out again and wreck her; and by this means undo what he had done. The wily old sherman, in this, hoped that either George's life would be lost in the wreck, or that he would be shot by the English Captain as soon as the ship struck. But George refused, fearing to be a party to such a base proceeding and William Northrop left him in a great rage and with many menaces. From the cabin he went secretly to Bath, a few miles distant, and laid before the authorities the facts of the assistance afforded the English ship. The authorities at once saw in the young man an enemy to his country and a friend to the English; and by Northrop's advice measures were secretly taken for his arrest. The next afternoon William Northrop called again on George and asked him if he had repented. `No, sir,' answered George firmly. `I have come to say I will consent to your union with May if you will consent to wreck this frigate in piloting her out.' `It is an inducement that nothing but a crime would suffer me to pass by unimproved, sir. Much as I love May, I will not make myself unworthy of her by such a deed of murder. No, sir, I cannot do it. She would not ask me to do it: she would scorn me if I did so base a thing for her pure love.' `Well, then, let the matter drop now. Come, walk with me homeward, and let us see and talk with May.' Unsuspicious of treachery, George accompanied him; but he had gone with him but a quarter of a mile from the door when, as they were passing a thicket, three men sprung upon the young pilot and secured him as a prisoner `in,' as they said, `the name of the State.' CHAPTER XX. The Tin-case. The young man was borne rudely off bound; and although William Northrop pretended to protest against it, George saw clearly enough that he was party to the attack upon him. His captors took him along a rocky path by the shore until they come to a road in a deep pine forest, when they placed him upon a horse and walked by his side through the gloomy wood. He was cheerful and by no means intimidated by his situation; and questioning his captors found he was arrested for having voluntarily piloted the English frigate into the bay, He did not feel that this was any crime, and so went on with them without fear of evil. He had not gone three miles in this way when the men came to a road by a river, where stood a waggon. To this they tackled the horse which George had rode, and all four getting into the waggon they rode on rapidly. In a short time a boat was seen coming down the river, padding near the shore. As it passed George, to his surprise, saw that it contained White Teeth. The Indian called to him, for he knew him well and was much attached to him, and asked where he was being taken. `To goal,' responded George, `for helping a British frigate get into the bay.' `Yiss. Me hear bout dat. Me in de same storm. `I thought you were drowned.' `Noh! Me swim! Me dive! Me get over de reef, nobody know how, and by'm bye me get shore good way down de coast! Who dem wid you?' `Officers!' `Hough! Berry good!' and the young Indian paddled on his way. But he had not gone far before he struck into the shore, and, landing quickly, drew up his boat, and then followed rapidly on the track of the prisoner. He had made up his mind to try and rescue him, for George had done him many kindnesses. Perhaps the reader is quite as much surprised to see him alive as George was. Being an excellent swimmer he had dove deep when the shallop struck and so escaped the fragments, one of which had made Northrop insensible. When he rose he found himself on the crest of a wave upon which he was carried quite over the ledge into the smoother water beyond. After struggling for two hours in the surf and nearly drowned, he reached the shore far to the east-ward; and finding a dry nook under a shelf in the rocks he laid down in it and slept till noon the next day. He awoke perfectly refreshed, and his first thought was of the medal about his neck. To his imagination it contained vast riches; and being largely gifted with acquisitiveness he resolved to keep it and see William Northrop no more. For this purpose he struck across the forest to a camp of his tribe, six miles distant on the river Kennebec; and there consulted an intelligent half-breed, and very handsome, Indian girl, whom he intended one day to make his wife, which she was nothing loth to be, as to its value. She could read well and was as intelligent as she was beautiful. She opened the case and found it contained papers instead of gold and Bank notes. At sight of these White Teeth looked blank; but in quarter of an hour after she had read them all to him, his face brightened up and he said, emphatically, `Good!' The next day he got a canoe to go down the river, and so round outside on a special mission to May Fawn, with the precious case about his neck. It was when on his way for the purpose he now fell in with George in custody of the officers. He now followed on their track stealthily for two miles, when the road left the river and wound over the hills. At this place on the left was the Indian encampment concealed from the road by the trees. White teeth was soon among his friends, and in five minutes, with four stout Indians, was making a circuit to cut off the wagon. They waited for it in a dark part of the forest, and after a bloodless struggle of two minutes the prisoner was rescued and the three officers left bound to the waggon. The whole affair took place so suddenly that George found himself free before he realized his new situation, They bore him between them, the four strong Indians, to their camp and, by White Teeth's order, tossed him bodily into a canoe. White Teeth took the paddle and darting away from the shore, told the Indians where they would find the canoe he had left down the shore. `You should not have rescued me in this manner, White Teeth!' said George, as soon as he could get time to object. `Nebber you say noting, Shorsge,' answered White Teeth, as the canoe shot rapidly down the dusky river. `De prison no catsh you. You good moosh. White Teeth love him.' `Well, so long as I am free I thank you.' `Yish. You glad—me glad.' `Where are you going?' `To de bay—see squaw May.' `No. Her father would be angry if he knew you rescued me. You must go to my house first. What is that on your nech?' `Mukeesh!' `What is mukeesh?' `Hab good in him for somebody!' `A charm, hey!' `Great fight by'm bye, Shorsge,' abruptly said the Indian, as if wishing to change the subject. And on still flew the light canoe. `Who are to fight?' `Big ship 'Merican, fight em big ship Yenlgeesh!' `Is there another frigate in the bay?' asked George, with surprise. `No. But big John, you know big John Indian!' `Yes.' `He tell me. He out fishin'. He meet uncle Natahnah in him canoe. Natahnah tell him he go tell big Captain down Boston how big ship broke her mast, and cotsh up tight in de bay; and tell big gun ship bring down make fight him!' `Is it possible!' `Yish!' `Who could have sent him?' 6 `Captn' Will'm!' `This is good news, if I could only reach that ship before she gets in,' mused George. He soon resolved what to do; for he was anxious to redeem his patriotism. He made known the purpose he had rapidly conceived in his mind to the young Indian, who at once entered fully into his plans. The object of the young fisherman will already have been divined. It was to endeavour to fall in with the American frigate as she should approach from Boston. To this end they proceeded down the river to a little cove near the sea-shore, where there was a camp of eight or ten Indian families, whose occupation was fishing. Here White Teeth obtained fish, and meat, and fresh water to last for three days, and from this place they embarked. After rounding the point at the river's mouth, they kept on parallel with the coast until they had passed the inlet in which George lived, and opened Northrop's bay. They kept well out to sea for fear of being seen by the English frigate, which they could see about five miles distant refitting. White Teeth several times remarked, as they sailed slowly by, for the canoe was rigged with a small brown sail, that he wished he could go on shore, and first see `the pretty squaw.' At length George smiling asked if he had fallen in love with May. `No, massa, me no love, Me hab Nesha to love. You hab pretty white squaw. Indian by—by hab nesha. Me wish to see white squaw very mosh.' `Will you tell me why, white Teeth? you seem to have news?' `Shorshe know readee?' `Yes.' `Den look 'em in dis case. Read em moosh good for white squaw. Nesha read for me, make me very glad for white squaw.' As the Indian spoke he took from his neck the case which Northrop, when he supposed death was inevitable, or that if either escaped, it would be more likely to be the Indian, had placed around his neck. This circumstance the Indian explained to George, who, opening the case, took out the papers. There were three in number. When George had finished perusing them there was an expression of joy and pride upon his fine face. He looked perfectly happy, but rather, as it seemed, for May than for himself. `Is it possible! it is incredible! How extraordinary! This, then, is the secret of all the mystery about William Northrop! of his deep hatred to the English; of his fear to be seen by them on shore; of his fear that one so low-born as George Hunnewell should marry his nobly-born daughter.' `Moosh berry good for pretty white squaw,' ejaculated White Teeth, as he watched the expression of George's face. `Very much, indeed. This is very extraordinary. There seems a special Providence in it all. That storm which brought William Northrop to fear instant death, was a blessing to his child.' But we will not linger over the joy and surprise, and mingled hopes and fears of the lover. He trembled, yet hoped. His discovery had placed him and May in new and different positions. But strong in the faith of her love he resolved to rejoice instead of despairing. The canoe kept on her way, and steered south-west, till the coast of Maine disappeared beneath the bending arc of the globe. They were directly in a line with the course of a ship from Boston to Northrop Bay; and the next morning a ship was visible, bearing down upon them. It soon proved to be the expected American frigate. George was taken on board,— told the captain all that had passed, made known the size and strength of the Englishman, and offered to pilot the American in atonement for his having saved the Englisher. His offer was gladly accepted, and as the ship came off the bay he took the helm. William Northrop was was therefore right when he said that he saw George Hunnewell upon her deck, and the Indian, White Teeth, at his side. We shall not enter into a detailed account of the enjoyment; for mortal combats have often been described, and all have a strong resemblance in their details. The American frigate, after coming abeam of her, furled her topsails, and opened her broad sides. The Englisher answered with equal bravery; but after thirty-five minutes, the English flag came down, and a boat from the Yankee frigate, preceded, however, by a swift Indian canoe, took possession of the conquered ship, and George Hunnewell with his own hand hoisted the stars and stripes, over her bloody decks. May saw this act, for she had hid her eyes from the scene and closed her ears to the roar of the battle, though she lingered on the cliff too anxious for the fate of her lover to tear herself away. But when she saw him leap first of all on the enemy's deck from the canoe, and perform this gallant act, she felt her heart bound with joy, and pride, and gratitude for his safety. The sun was just setting when the frigate struck. The prisoners were transferred to the Yankee frigate the same night. Among them were the English captain, and the young officer with the star upon his breast, the latter being wounded severely in the side by a musket ball. George remained on board the American frigate that night, for he had an important interview to hold with the cap tain touching the papers he had discovered; for he needed the advice of some intelligent person; and the captain having shown himself to be his friend, he laid the whole matter before him in the cabin. When the American had read the papers, he sent for the English captain to come into the cabin. `Do you know, sir, any thing of the family of the Earl of Northford in England?' `It is one of the oldest peerages of the realm.' `Do you know any thing peculiar in the history of this family!' `The last earl was convicted of being treasonably in league with Napoleon; and it was proved against him that he had offered facilities on the coast of his own estates, for a landing of the French Invader. This is notorious.' `And he lost his title and estates, and was exiled?' `Yes; but he had a daughter to whom the attaint did not extend by the intercession of the Queen. But when this daughter sent for to be placed under the guardianship of the crown, she was no where to be found; and there is no question but what he took his child with him.' `He did. That child and her father are within half a mile of us. Read those papers.' They were confirmatory documents sufficiently clear and undisputable to establish May Fawn's claim to the title of Countess of Northford. William Northrop and his daughter were sent for and brought on board, he, after making a fierce resistance. When he saw White Teeth in the cabin, and his tin case and papers laying before the captain he understood all that had transpired. The English captain also recognised him at once as the tratorous Earl of Northford. He confessed the fact, and said that his love for his child led him to take her with him, and keep the secret of her birth from her; but he had drawn up writings and placed them in the tin case securely, so that, at his death, she might come into the possession of her rights. The beauty and grace of the maiden charmed all present. George Hunnewell looked most unhappy. She saw it, and understood the cause. `If I am to sacrifice my heart's affections to a coronet,' she said firmly, and smiling as she took his hand, `I prefer remaining May Northrop!' William Northrop, after all had been said, looked rather gratified at the result. A heavy load seemed to be removed from his mind. He took his daughter's hand and placing it in George's, said, `Be happy, my child, if this will make you so. I suppose you will now go to England and forget your exiled father. Be it so!' `No, sir. If I am such as it appears I am, I shall cast myself at the foot of the throne to solicit your pardon!' Our story is now ended. George Hunnewell and May were married that very evening (for May would have it so, lest some power should prevent it) in the cabin of the frigate. William Northrop returned to his cabin, while May, with her happy husband, sailed for Boston, and thence embarked for England, where her claim was acknowledged. She succeed in obtaining her father's pardon, on condition he should never leave her estate. George, as a patriotic American felt some compunctions in being an English earl (by courtesy); but after the peace, he became more reconciled, for his beautiful wife's sake, to this brilliant change in his life. Tom, who was an illegitimate son of William of Northford, shared his sister's happiness, and seemed to be conscious of the grandeur of her new position, and to feel proud of her. Buttermilk accompanied George to England as butler, fared sumptuously every day, and walked no more than became a partly black gentleman who had the keys to the wine-vaults.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CAPTAIN VELASCO; AND THE YOUNG LIEUTENANT. OR, OUR PRIVATE BUCCANEERING ADVENTURE. BY J. H. INGRAHAM. CHAPTER I. `If we broke the laws, i' faith! we mended 'em again.' In the month of September 183—, I took passage in a small, rakish-looking Spanish schooner, bound for Havana— We weighed anchor about eight in the morning, and sailed out of the harbor with a fair wind and the prospect of reaching our port in four or five days.— I was the only passenger. The crew consisted of five men forward, a black cook, and the captain and mate. They were all Spaniards. The vessel was one of two or three regular traders that run monthly between Havana and the Southern ports of the Union. It was a long, narrow craft, sharp in the bows and very low in the water, with masts that raked like a pen when one writes it. She was a saucy-visaged looking sea-dog, but having the reputation of being a fast sailer, which reputation she did not belie, I resolved to take passage in her, in preference to a heavy Kennebec lumber brig that was to sail that same afternoon. I had not seen the Captain until after I got on board, my passage having been taken at the counting-room of the consignee, while he was at the Custom House. After I had settled myself in the state room assigned me, which the mate had resigned for my accommodation, finding that the Captain had come on board, and that we were fairly in motion, I put on my sea blouse and ascended to the deck. We were moving, or rather gliding thro' the water at the rate of five knots, the foresail and mainsail, with the fore-topsail drawing free, and running dead before the wind. The tall, slender, pliant masts, the withe-like yards across, the long and narrow well kept deck, the foreign air about every thing on board for a few moments fixed my attention. The Spanish sailors, in their striped woolen shirts, red, peaked caps, and with their huge whiskers, or mustaches, were at their posts ready to obey the next order of the mate, a fine-looking, tough old Spanish seaman, with thick grey hair, and a pepper and salt colored mustache on his lip as enormous as the tail of a grey squirrel; nevertheless, there was a bluff humor in his clear black eyes, that showed he was a good hearted man, ferocious as his `bogotes' were. At the helm stood a young, dark looking, but exceedingly handsome man not above four or five and twenty. He wore no whiskers, but a jet black imperial relieved the fine curve beneath his under lip and chin. His face was sparkling with intelligence and feeling, and his large black expressive eyes were lively with animation. His figure was slight and symmetrical, well set off by a loose gingham coat, striped with scarlet and blue, which he wore with the most careless negligence. His hair was dark and flowing to his shoulders; a massive ring glittered on the little finger of the hand that grasped the tiller, and in the bosom of his blue checked camisa glared a ruby. A fine, bold expression of determination, united with a seaman-like frankness, at once prepossessed me in his favor. I knew it was Captain Velasco, for I had heard the mate address him by his title just as I came on deck. As he saw me look towards him, he bowed with a smile and said with that courtesy which never deserts the Spaniard, `Buenos dias, caballero! I am glad to see you on deck! We have a fine wind and shall soon be on the open sea! Is the Senor sea-sick?' I answered in the negative, when he smiled with much gratification and said, `Bueno! It will be pleasant then! I am happy to have you a passenger. I hope your quarters below suit you!' `I am quite well pleased with them,' I answered. `They are comfortable for one. I seldom take passengers; but it is pleasant to have one or two agreeable persons, when the wind is fair and the sea smooth. I hope, Senor, you will make a passage highly to your satisfaction.' `I have no doubt of it, Senor Velasco,' I replied; and the ice being thus broken to our acquaintance we were very soon afterwards talking together very cordially; he having resigned the helm to one of the crew after passing the light. It was noon and we were seated at dinner together below, (I would here remark that my friend, the Captain was quite an epicure and lived accordingly,) when the mate reported a boat in sight towards the coast making a signal. The handsome young captain was just then relating to me the history of his life; how that he was the nephew of an Havana merchant, who had sent him both as captain and supercargo of the schooner, which the uncle owned; but, said he, I shall purchase half of her when I reach Havana, having laid up enough for the purpose. One must grow rich, you know!' `Are you married?' I asked him. He colored, and his eyes beamed with a gratified, happy expression, as he answered, laughing, `No, Senor, not yet! I shall be one of these days. I am plighted to my cousin Isabel, my uncle's daughter. She is very beautiful, and I love her with all my heart as my cousin, and I adore her as my betrothed wife!' It was at this crisis of our conversation that old Jacobs the mate called down the companion-way to inform us that a boat was in the shore signalizing us.— Captain Velasco went on deck and I followed. We were running along parallel with the coast about five miles off the land, and about a mile from us we discovered a small boat from which a white handkerchief or flag was waving. The boat was more than a league out to sea, and as it did not seem to be a fishing skiff the captain got his glass to take a look at it. `It is a green pleasure boat, and contains a single person, who seems to be a gentleman,' said he after a minute's observation. `He is standing up in the boat waving a handkerchief towards us! It is some person adrift. Forward there! Stand by to tack ship! The next moment we had turned the schooner's bows from her course and were standing landward straight for the boat. On seeing that he was observed, the person in her ceased waving his handkerchief. In about a quarter of an hour we came up with him, and flinging him a rope brought him along side. He ascended the deck and thanked us, in general, with the warmest expressions of gratitude. He was a young gentleman, well dressed, wearing a foraging cap such as is worn in the army, and in an undress military frock coat. He had a fine, manly air, and was altogether a good looking young fellow, with an air of decided high breeding. He introduced himself in English to the Captain, who understood the language very well, as Lieut. Henry — of the U. S. Army; and said very handsomely, `It is not enough that I thank you for your humanity in relieving me from a very perilous and annoying situation, for you see (as we had done with surprise) that I had no oars in my boat, and the tide was drifting me rapidly out to sea. It is my duty also to inform you, gentleman,' he continued, laughing and blushing, `how I came to be put in such a fix!' `Come into the cabin, Senor Lieutenant;' said the Captain courteously.— `We were just dining when you signalized us. You will need refreshment.— Dine first, and then explain what you choose afterwards. We ask nothing!— As for me and my vessel, I am a Spanish trader, between Charleston, Savannah and the Havannah, and am now bound to the latter port, with this gentleman as a passenger and a fair cargo! So you know us. If you desire it, you may visit the Havana with us; or be put on shore in this vicinity. It will be my pleasure to serve you, Senor!' The young officer bowed with deep gratitude in his looks and descended with us to the cabin. After we had progressed a little with eating, he spoke again and said, with an air of frankness, `I cannot refrain any longer, in justice to myself and your very natural curiosity, to explain how I chanced to be placed in such a ludicrous predicament. You are both young men, and perhaps know what it is to love! I shall therefore make no concealment of my affair!' The Captain smiled and his sparkling glance confessed to the soft impeachment. What our reply was is not on record. `Know then, my friends, I am engaged to the daughter of a wealthy planter who resides four miles up the river, the mouth of which is in sight. I first saw her at Saratoga last year, and we very soon found from mutual tastes and sympathies, and a union of hopes and fears, that we were designed for each other.— So we plighted our troth. But when Col —, her father, was made acquainted with the fact in a respectful letter which I addressed to him, soliciting her hand, he sent me in reply, the insulting answer, that his child should never wed a poor officer who had nothing but his pay; and that as I doubtless thought more of his dollars than his daughter, he desired that I should cease to think neither of the one nor the other as both were equally beyond my reach.' `The suspicious old dotard!' exclaimed Captain Velasco with contempt. `The next day he left the springs and I saw no more of Isabel —.' `Isabel? Is that her name?' demanded ed the Captain with pleased surprise. `It is. But why do you exclaim, Senor?' `It is a very much loved name. I am more interested now, for that name's sake!' `We corresponded secretly, and at length I prevailed upon her to consent to elope with me if I visited the South; for gentlemen, it becomes me to say, that in my family, character, and social position there was nothing in the least exceptionable to me. All my crime in the sight of her father was, that I had only my pay!' `You had more! You had honor, character, rank in the army! These were an equivalent to his money! Aye, my friend, more than an equivalent. A rich man who marries his daughter to these has `half a dozen for his six,' as our proverb has it. But go on, Senor!' `I came out South, having got a furlough of two months. I secretly met her in the grounds of her father's villa, and there planned our elopement. The distance to Charleston was but forty miles —' `It is about that from here by sea,' said Captain Velasco in parenthesis. `I had come from thence in a close carriage with fleet horses. This I had left on the opposite shore under the care of a tried friend who had volunteered to act as coachman in the affair. I crossed the river in a leaky skiff I found on the shore, and landed at the foot of the lawn.' `When was this?' I asked. `About nine o'clock last evening, just before the moon rose! I found Isabel and a faithful old African nurse awaiting me with every thing prepared for flight. As the skiff I crossed in would not be a safe conveyance across the river, I took for the purpose one of two boats belonging to Colonel — which were under the boat-house. Isabel had left a note for her father informing him of her destina tion, and that she should as my wife be happy to meet him at Charleston the next day. I had just started from the shore with my precious prize, when Col. — appeared on the bank in great excitement. By some means he had discovered Isabel's absence from the house, and perhaps suspected something like the truth, as I had seen in Charleston, his body servant whom he had with him at Saratogo, who doubtless had informed his master that he had met me there.— He now appeared on the shore, and seeing, for it was light enough for this, that Isabel was in the boat, he hailed and called her by name. She was silent, I pulled with all my strength to widen the distance. Instantly he began to call upon his slaves, and in three minutes he was in the other boat in pursuit. The river is wide and before I got half way across, he was close upon me, with four negroes at the oars! The upshot of it was that he overtook me, and in spite of my best efforts at withstanding him he succeeded in securing me by the aid of four slaves, binding my hands behind me and taking possession of his daughter.— He then gave me a parting word of advice well laced with enraged oaths and removing the oars, thwarts and every thing available for paddling from the boat he set me adrift.' `The barbarous monster!' cried the Captain indignantly. The current was strong and I was set rapidly down the river, having the pain of seeing Isabel borne from me, filling the air with her cries. I will not attempt to describe, for I cannot, my feelings,' he said, after a pause of deep emotion. `I finally succeeded in releasing my hands from their confinement. By this time I was going out to sea. By midnight I found I was rocking upon the ground swell, and far from the land.— The tide turned and carried me back to within a mile of the beach, when again at eleven o'clock it flowed seaward again and my hopes of reaching the shore were destroyed on discovering that I was again receding from it towards the open sea. I then looked for help seaward and discovered your vessel. I continued to make signals until, happily, you saw me and had the humanity to turn from your course to my relief!' We had listened with deep interest to the young officer's story; and when he had ended we remained seated some time in silence. Suddenly the young Captain sprang to his feet and called to Jocobo. `Senor!' `How far are we from the mouth of the river — off which we last tacked?' `Two leagues!' `Put the schooner about!' `Si Senor!' answered the mate; and in a few moments afterwards to our surprize we were running back towards the spot where we had taken the young officer on board. CHAPTER II. The handsome young Spanish Captain remained quietly seated at table after he had given his sudden order to put the schooner about, and seemed for some time to be wholly absorbed in extracting the meat from the labarynthine cells of a walnut. He was silent and thoughtful. At length he called for a chart and began to examine it. We both regarded him attentively, and then looked at each other. Our mutual interchange of glances showed me that the young American officer did not yet even suspect what the motive was which led to this command to change the course of the vessel. His look was full of surprise and inquiry, I, however, guessed the cause; for by this time I had pretty well understood the chivalrous character of the captain; I, however, decided to remain silent also, until he choose to communicate what I saw was working upward in his mind.— At length he looked up, and said with a smile, addressing the lieutenant,— `My friend, would you like to see your fair mistress once more?' `See her? I would give half the years of my life if I thought I should ever lay eyes off her again!' he answered, with deep and enthusiastic ardor. `Then you may be happy—you shall see her at less sacrifice!' said he, with a peculiar smile of inward gratification, as enjoying within the happiness he was about to communicate. `Speak! how?' he cried, half hoping, half doubting, and looking quite bewildered;—for the chivalrous idea which had arisen in the mind of the noble and gallant young Spanish seamen, and which had prompted him to put his vessel about, had never once occurred to him. `In this way!—but first fill your glasses, amigos. Now listen:—you say the villa of Colonel — stands about five miles, or thereabouts, up the river from the sea. My chart, which I have just been looking at, shows me that there is a plenty of water and a good channel even for several miles higher up the river. The wind, as it now is, is fair; and before five o'clock, by the time we get abreast of the mouth of the river, we shall have the tide setting out very slowly. My plan then is this,' he said, in a very positive way, peculiar to him; `to run up the river and anchor abreast of the villa. When there, I think we three together can forge some plot for getting the fair Isabel into our possession! It is for this I have put my vessel about.' The young officer listened at first with a surprise that lost itself, as the captain went on, in the strongest joy. He impulsively rose from the table, and seizing the hands of the Spanish captain, thanked him with the overflowing gratitude of his heart. We now began to discuss the whole matter before us in a business-like manner. `I have no doubt,' said the captain, `we shall be able to effect the surprise we meditate without any difficulty.' `The villa stands quite alone,' said the lieutenant; who, flinging his griefs and despairings to the winds, now entered heart and soul, life and hope, in the enterprise. `There is a plantation-house a mile above, and one or two miles nearer the mouth of the river a carriage-road on the bank connecting them. Opposite is a small farm, from which a lane half a mile in length conducts to the turnpike to Charleston. It was at the bottom of this lane, close by the water side, that I left my friend Oglethrope with the coach. What has become of him now I have no idea. He must have heard the struggle on the river, but in the darkness and distance probably did not understand its nature;—at all events, he could not have aided me.' `He will probably remain in the neighborhood till he hears from you,' I remarked. `Yes, unless the Colonel has sent to see if any accomplices were lurking in the vicinity.' `It is my impression he thinks it was my intention to escape altogether in the boat, and is quite unsuspicious that any carriage was in waiting.' `So much the better,' answered Senor Velasco. `Now, as I understand how the land lays, I find that our plan is more and more feasible. We shall apprehend no danger from either of the plantations, above or below; while the farm house opposite will be unable to interfere. But I don't mean any alarm or noise shall be made. We must do what we do very quietly;—for, gentlemen,' he added, laughing, `it is a little better than a buccaneering expedition we are bent upon! But love must excuse it!—I am in love—and it is an Isabel I love; and were I in your case, I should expect you to do for me what I am about to do for you!' `Noble captain!' exclaimed the young officer, in the depth of his gratitude. `I do but my duty. Come—let us on deck and see how we progress.' We left the table and ascended to the deck. We were running along with a light air from the south, within a league of the shore, and about four miles from a group of trees on a green promontory that marked the mouth of the river. The land visible was forest and open upland, here and there interrupted by a plantation inland, with its white mansion and group of negro cottages. The scene was agreeable to the eye, and particularly beautiful about the mouth of the river, towards which we were directing our course. At length we came so near that we could hear the birds singing in the trees upon the land, and at intervals the bleating of sheep and lowing of herds. It was a lovely afternoon, and we were in excellent spirits; for we felt that we were upon a successful adventure, which was not only exciting in itself, but which was to make two young and true hearts happy. We thought how overjoyed and grateful Isabel would be;—we knew how grateful her lover was. But the woe and disappointment of Colonel — never once entered our thoughts. Thus we sailed along, towing alongside the green boat the lover had been cast adrift in, still containing all the baggage (a valise, carpet-bag and trunk, with a band-box also,) belonging to the heroine, and which, in his haste to get possession of his daughter and get rid of her lover, the old gentleman had not seen—at least had not removed. So all that was wanted was the lady—or, as Captain Velasco expressed it, `We have the salt, all we now want is the egg.' `Jacobo!' said he, as the schooner ran into the river, and began to ascend, with green shores on either hand. `Senor!' `Get up an American ensign, and set it!' `Si, Senor!' answered the mate. `We must show American colors or we shall frighten the country,' answered Captain Velasco, with a smile, as the stars and stripes ascended and floated in the air over the stern. The sail up was beautiful. We passed, two miles from the sea, the first plantation mentioned by the lieutenant, and one or two opposite. The houses were large and handsome, with spacious galleries, and were situated at an imposing distance back from the river, with lofty trees around and a wide lawn in front; while in the rear could be seen the white `quarters' of the negroes. `Little did I think last night, when I was drifting down this river past these plantations, I should be re-ascending it so soon, and with the hopes that fill my bosom.' `Those hopes shall be realised, amigo mio,' answered Senor Velasco very positively. `I don't know what the underwriters would say if they knew where the vessel was. But that is my business!' `There is a distant cupola on the left, peering above the trees,' I remarked, pointing out the object just after we had turned a bend in the river. `It is the villa!—it is Colonel —'s place,' answered the lieutenant, colouring, and his voice trembling with the emotions of his heart, on once more beholding the house that held her whom he loved. `That is the house, then,' repeated the Captain, as he took the glass from his eye. `I will stand on as if intending to pass it—get a little ways above—then put the schooner in the wind, and let her act as if some accident had happened. I will let her drift down till again opposite the villa, and then drop anchor. Col. — will thus suppose our stopping just there accidental, and his suspicion will not be awakened; for to confess the truth, caballeros, I am told my craft hasn't the most honest look for a civil trader!' `Manage the matter your own way, my good captain,' said the officer; `I leave it entirely to you.' `Bueno! Then you will see how I manage. There is no doubt the old Colonel, in setting you adrift as he did, at ebb tide, taking from you every means of getting to land, and tying your hands so you could not even swim, meditated your murder.' `The idea is horrible! He possibly did not think of the consequences in his resentment,' answered the officer, with a generous warmth in defence of one so near a relative to Isabel. `He doesn't deserve the least courtesy at our hands,' answered the captain.— `Nevertheless, for your sake, I will treat him well if he falls into them. We now approach the villa: keep out of sight now, my friend, for if you are seen all will be lost. Lie down upon the deck on my hammock, and observe through the opening under the taffrail, as well as you can, what goes on. Stay, I have a masquerading mask below—put that on and my cloak and you are thoroughly disguised.' The disguise was complete, and the young officer took his station on deck with the rest of us. The mask was that of an old Jew with a flowing beard, and gave him quite a venerable aspect. The schooner stood on until we came in sight of the villa. We passed in front of it, and with a glass I could see an old gentleman on the portico, whom the officer said was the Colonel. There was a negro slave or two about him, but no lady was visible. `He has locked her up, I dare say,' said the lover with angry vehemence, so strongly through his huge Jewish nose, that we laughed—he as well as the rest of us. `I'll find the key,' answered the Spaniard very quietly, after having taken a long and steady survey of the old gentleman. `I have it—I see my way clear now,' he added emphatically. We stood on half a mile past the villa, when the captain took the helm; and for the next five minutes the schooner behaved as if she was tipsy—if schooners ever get tipsy. Now her topsail would lay shivering—then backed—and then filled again—and then lay back altogether. Her foresail seemed to be undecided which side of the vessel to swing, and so kept moving from one side to the other in the most restless manner. By and by the nose of the vessel fairly swung round, and so round and round she turned, as if on a pivot, all the while drifting downward. Colonel — was seen to leave the portico, cross the lawn, and approach the water side, to have a better view of the vessel that seemed to him in such extraordinary difficulties. At length, as the schooner came opposite his house, her boat was let down —(the green boat, the baggage being removed, having been towed ashore and tied two miles below, to prevent any suspicion that might arise from his seeing it with the schooner)—and two men pulled ashore, I acting the part of coxswain, with a fourth person in the bows holding the end of a light hawser, which was run out of the vessel as we receded from it. On nearing the shore I rose up and said, very politely and civilly, in my assumed character as captain,— `Will you permit us, sir, to attach a hawser to the bolt in your boat-house? My rudder does not govern the vessel, (which was true enough as she acted,) and I don't care to let down an anchor, as heaving it again will detain me.' `Certainly, sir,' answered the Colonel with a wave of his hand. `Pray what has occurred?' `A little matter, sir—I will soon have all right again,' I answered, in my character—having consented, to carry out our plot, to take Velasco's place, as his being a Spaniard might be against our ultimate success. `I have been watching you,' he said, as the man sprung ashore and took a double turn with the hawser in the bolt; `I saw something was the matter, and faith, I expected to see you drift ashore, —I am happy to see you escape.— There, the rope brings your vessel up now, sir.' `Yes—she will hang steady by that till I am ready to set sail on her again.' `How far up the river do you go?' `To Mr. — (I forget the name) 's plantation to take in cotton.' `Felton's, I dare say—he was looking for a vessel, I hear. Stay, sir,' he added, advancing nearer the boat as I was about to put off. `Eh, have—that is—have you fallen in with a—a—small green boat by any chance?' Here he seemed very much embarrassed and confused, looked guilty, and added quickly, `I—I had mine stolen last night by some scamp.' `No, sir—I saw no stolen boat,' I answered evasively, and put off from the bank. `What the deuce could have become of the scoundrel!' I heard him say as he turned away; `I fear I went too far!— but I dare say he'll escape to torment me yet.' I left him still soliloquizing with himself half aloud, and reaching the brig, was complimented by Captain Velasco for the manner in which I had performed my part of the conspiracy. CHAPTER III. The schooner having been brought to by the hawser, and made stationary, and the sails brailed up instead of being furled, that we might move at a moment's warning, we assembled at the tea-table, there to discuss further proceedings.— The Lieutenant had a very little appetite, and was quite as restless and impatient as became a lover under his circumstances. At length it was decided that a spy should be sent into the camp to see where the young lady then was, and to take note of the state of things at the house. The young officer at once offered himself as the spy in question; but to this arrangement Captain Velasco wisely and very properly objected on the score that he might be detected and recognized. `But not in my disguise,' answered our friend. `Your disguise alone would be utter ruin to our plans,' said the Spaniard laughing. `Leave it to me, amigo mio.' Be quiet and in due time we shall get to the windward of the Colonel. Come, I will be the spy! By and by I will return and report myself to you!' Captain Velasco then retired to his state-room and in a little while returned dressed with great elegance and taste as a Spanish gentleman, to which station his appearance and address, as well as his education gave him full title. Without explaining his intention, he ordered his boat to be ready, and with a smile bade us good evening and descended into the yawl. The sun had just set, but still a bright and glowing twilight filled the atmosphere. We saw him land at the foot of the lawn and slowly, with the air of a stranger admiring the grounds, loiter towards the portico of the villa on which we could see the form of the Colonel.— We looked in vain hoping to catch a glimpse of his daughter. As the Captain advanced, and came near the house, he turned abruptly aside as if to avoid it, when we beheld the Colonel, who had been watching his progress, leave the portico and approach him with an air of hospitable courtesy. His salutation was returned in the most graceful manner by the young Spaniard, and after what seemed sundry formal iuterchanges of civilities, we saw Velasco accompanying him to the house and enter it with him. The twilight deepened and night veiled objects from our sight, and full an hour passed ere we heard the boat returning to the schooner. We met the young Spaniard as he ascended the side, but asked him no questions until we were all three seated in the cabin. He then began: `You saw me enter the house. My ruse had the effect I contemplated; for the Colonel supposing me to be a passenger who had landed to view his grounds, came out and invited me in!' `Did you see her, my dear Captain?' demanded the lover with anxiety mingled with hope. `In a moment you shall learn all, amigo mio,' responded the Captain with an encouraging smile. `I entered the drawing room and took a seat directly opposite a window which commanded a view of the schooner. The Colonel and I then entered into conversation. I commented upon the beauty of his grounds, and he alternated by putting me questions touching my travels. I satisfied him on that score, and as he ordered wine, we soon became very civil to each other, and drank one another's healths. He particularly inquired if we had not even seen any boat any where at sea, and as he three times put questions concerning the `stolen boat,' I asked him who he suspected had taken her? Well, being warmed with his own wine, and finding me a very free and easy companion after his liking, he opened his heart to me, and told me the whole affair. `Is it possible?' exclaimed the lieutenant. `Yes, only he gave his own complexion to your physiognomy of course, and did not compliment you at all!' `I dare say,' remarked the young officer, biting his lips. `After he had got through, I of course gave him my full sympathy, on being so near losing his daughter; and I so won upon his favor that he looked as if he would have been very glad to have made me his son-in-law! Don't be jealous, my friend,' said the Captain laughing; `for I have an Isabel of my own, you know. When I found I had got well into the Colonel's good opinion, through my sympathy for him, I ventured to say that it would afford me great satisfaction to have the honor of seeing his daughter. `She is in her chamber now,' he answered, `and has not left it to-day, being very highly incensed against me. But I will go and see if I can prevail upon her to come down!' While he was gone I took a card and wrote rapidly upon it these words: `Your friend Lieutenant — is safe. He awaits you on board the schooner which picked him up in the boat. Her Captain is his friend, and is here to befriend him and you. Be secret and courageous.' `Noble Velasco!' cried the lover, pressing his hands. `No, don't thank me yet. I had no time to write more; for, at this moment the Colonel re-entered and said that his daughter declined leaving her room that night. He seemed highly displeased and I was not a little disappointed; for I had hoped to have seen her and slipped the card in her hand!' `And you did not see her?' `Listen, mi amigo! I set my wits to work and finally hit upon a plan. I said, I trust I shall have the pleasure of seeing your fair daughter on my return from up the river; in the meanwhile permit me to send up my card, so that, if she should chance never to see me, she may know who has solicited that honor. He bowed and said he should be most happy to have me send my card up to his daughter. I then wrote upon a blank card, the name of `Don Carlos Ferdinand del Cabellero,' a fancy name of my own, and handed him the card, at reading the name upon which he bowed very profoundly at the card and then as profoundly at me. `John,' said he to a slave, `take up this card to your mistress and tell her it is that of the gentleman who has done her the honor to inquire for her.' As the servant was leaving the room I called him back, saying, `Stay, I omitted to affix my address to the card, sir!' and taking it from him I wrote upon it, after the name, `Havana, Cuba;' then watching my opportunity, I exchanged one card for the other, and gave the slave the one which I had first written. `Admirable!' we both exclaimed with gratified surprise. `He left the room with it, while I, having laid my train, proceeded to engage the Colonel in conversation upon cotton, tobacco and politics. In about twenty minutes a female slave came into the room and approaching me said, `Mistress says she sends you her card, sir!' and the girl handed me a card which I immediately put up lest the Colonel should desire to examine it. But he only said with a smile, `My daughter is coming to, I perceive sir! If your schooner was to wait till to-morrow I have no doubt you could then see her. I would like to have your opinion, as a stranger, of our Southern females; and Isabel has been no little admired.' I told him I regretted I could not detain the schooner but gave him hopes after the cotton had been taken in, I might again call at the villa. I then proceeded to speak of you, as adroitly as I could,' added the Captain looking at the lieutenant; `and after getting from him his objections to you, (which all lumped in one, amounted to only this, that you were like myself and half of the finest fellows in the world, poor!) I eloquently took up the gloves in your defence, as an entire stranger to you of course, and showing how much wiser it was to marry his daughter to a noble, honorable young ellow with a heart to love her and a sword to defend her, than to some fellow without a soul and whose only merit lay in having so many negroes, and making so many bales of cotton or hogsheads of tobacco! Well, the old gentleman listened to me! I used the argumentum ad hominem, alluding to his own title (a militia one at that though) and the honor of the profession. Said I, `Sir, Mr. — is a young man now it is true.— He is a lieutenant it is true, and lives on the miserable pay with which Congress starves the army officers, as if they were trying a great national experiment, to ascertain practically how much a young man in the army can live upon per annum and not be obliged to eat his sword. (The Colonel laughed, and I meant he should.) He is a lieutenant and he is young; but he will not always be a lieutenant! he will not always be young. There are steps in the army, and they keep going up and up till by and by the lieutenant becomes a General! Your daughter may marry a poor lieutenant; but you forget she may be the wife of a General! Besides, said I, if he is poor, and this is your only objection, it is in your power to remove it. You can make them rich and happy. You have enough for all. If it is eventually to be your daughter's, you think she would prefer sharing it now with the man of her choice. My dear sir, I continued, on your own account and your daughter's, I should be delighted if you could reverse your decision in this matter and make two young persons perfectly happy!' We listened to the young Spaniard's eloquent recital of his address to the Colonel, with surprise and admiration. `He consented—he yielded!' I at once exclaimed. `No—no, never!' repeated the lieutenant shaking his head. `I am sure he did not.' `You are right, my friend. He did not yield. He listened and at first seemed softened; but at length looked very black, and said that you had stolen away his daughter, and this act would forever bar all reconciliation with you. Finding that all my eloquence had been thrown away, I felt not a little annoyed, and soon rose to take leave; pleading the necessity of being on board. But as I left I said, `Perhaps, sir, the destruction of the young gentleman you so inhumanly treated, by shipwreck and death, may forever prevent any reconciliation. I question if he survives.' `I care not, if he be at the bottom of the sea,' he said warmly and with this I left him. `Now cabelleros,' continued the young Spaniard, `after this I consider Colonel — as having placed himself out of the limits of our forbearance and courtesies. I shall treat him without ceremony. It had been my wish to endeavor to reconcile him to the match and then acquaint him that you were on board. But I must change my tactics, and treat him as he deserves.' `But the card? What was it?' cried the lover. `I did not read it in the house, and tried by moonlight to make it out, but without success. I could only see it contained writing on the side opposite to that the name was written upon Here it is.' Taking it from his pocket, he extended it to the lieutenant who passionately pressed it to his lips, and then read, first to himself, and then aloud as follows: `Generous Stranger, Your few words have made me happy, and filled my bosom with joyful hopes. If you will communicate to me any plan for my escape and reunion with him, you say is your friend, be assured I will cooperate with you. My room is over the parlor. Its windows open upon the gal lery. I dare not leave my room to go through the house, as the servants are my father's spies. If a ladder could be placed so as to reach the top of the piazza, and he was below, I should have the courage to descend! I shall await your movements with trembling hopes. Thank God for his preservation. Your grateful but unknown friend, ISABEL. `She will be on the watch from her window for every movement on board the schooner,' said the lover. `Dearest Isabel! Noble and brave and true to me to the last.' `She suggests the best plan for her escape,' said the Captain. `In two hours the moon will cast the front of the house in shadow. By that time the Colonel will have retired. I will drop the vessel down a few rods so as to be hidden to his eyes by that group of trees on shore, and he will then go to bed with more confidence. In the meanwhile let us have a ladder made in two parts so that we can easily carry it and with joints to put it together readily. Soon as the moon gives us shadow enough on this side of the house we will start on our adventure.' Every thing was propitious. At the time given we went ashore, all three of us, well armed, with four oarsmen, and bearing the joints of the ladder, which we had made more like stairs with board steps than like a ladder. I first advanced and carefully reconnoitered the house, and reported all quiet. The Lieutenant then left a group of trees which had sheltered the party, and coming near her window made a signal with the wave of a handkerchief. The blind was slowly opened and a white signal fluttered in answer. We then advanced with our ladders, jointed it, and planted it. The lover lightly ascended to the balcony.— He was lost to us a moment below, but the audible sounds of a brace of kisses and a subdued exclamation of joy in a female voice, told us he had not gone astray. The next moment he appeared descending the ladder with her, and the Captain rescued her in his arms, and placed her upon the ground in safety.— We immediately retreated, the Captain leaving the ladder as a significant sign to the Colonel not only that his daughter had flown but that she had had ample assistance from friends outside the garrison. In ten minutes afterwards we were safely on board the schooner; and as Oglethrope, the lieutenant's frlend, (I had forgot to say) had been discovered by us from the deck before dark, still hovering in the neighborhood on the opposite shore, waiting for his friend or some intelligence from him, and had the horses harnessed again and in readiness with the carriage, after a short delay for mutual congratulations on board the schooner, we pulled to the other shore, and saw our lovers safely in the carriage, with Oglethrope on the box. We bade them a hearty farewell, and amid a shower of adieus and words of gratitude the carriage rolled off at ten miles an hour in the direction of Charleston. The next morning, as the sun rose, Cape — at the mouth of the river where we had perpetrated our buccaneering adventure, bore from us N.N.W. 1-2 North, twelve miles distant. We afterwards learned by letter, from the Lieutenant, that they arrived in Charleston by daylight, drove to the house of a Justice of the Peace and were married just as the sun was rising. The Colonel afterwards became reconciled to them both, and when he was made fully acquainted with the conspiracy he laughed heartily, and swore he would go a thousand miles to see and have another evening `with that rare rogue, Don Velasco.'

      <field name="fulltext">`Generous Stranger, Your few words have made me happy, and filled my bosom with joyful hopes. If you will communicate to me any plan for my escape and reunion with him, you say is your friend, be assured I will cooperate with you. My room is over the parlor. Its windows open upon the gal lery. I dare not leave my room to go through the house, as the servants are my father's spies. If a ladder could be placed so as to reach the top of the piazza, and he was below, I should have the courage to descend! I shall await your movements with trembling hopes. Thank God for his preservation. Your grateful but unknown friend, ISABEL.</field>
