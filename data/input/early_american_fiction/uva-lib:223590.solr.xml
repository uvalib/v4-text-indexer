      <field name="fulltext">THE COUNTESS IDA. CHAPTER I. It was six when Claude returned to his hotel. He was met at the door by his friend Denham, who had just arrived from London. Of all men, he was the one he most esteemed and loved. He was, in some respects, the antithesis of Claude, and it was, perhaps, this very difference which made them more attached to each other. He was totally without Claude's contemplative habits, but usually acted from impulses which, if not always prudent or wise, were always noble. He was frank, generous, and bold; full of strong affections and quick passions; a faithful friend, and a good hater. In one respect he differed widely from his friend. He held duelling to be a custom, under certain circumstances, sanctioned by necessity, and useful in its effects upon society. Without any particularly serious views of religion, he professed to believe that, in the present state of the world, the meek doctrines of Christianity were permitted at times to give way to other considerations bearing upon individual character and the general harmony of society; in short, he was also a duellist, though in a far different way from the debauched, vindictive, and cruel Elkington. The latter adopted the principle as a mode of shielding himself in a course of profligacy, and of acquiring a notoriety of which a purer mind or a more generous heart would have been ashamed; the former as a means of protecting his person from insult and his name from calumny, and of redressing all unjust injuries directed either against himself or his friends. He thought the world was thronged with persons who might be regarded as beasts of prey, ready to attack those not prepared with means of physical defence, and that the same principle which permitted a traveller to use a pistol against a highwayman, allowed a resort to the same weapon against those who, by force or fraud, encroached too far on the rights and feelings of a gentleman. This subject had often been discussed between these two young men, who each respected, while he opposed the opinion of the other. The delight of such a friendly meeting as now took place, chased from Claude the clouds with which his present painful position had long shaded his mind and countenance. Many and rapid were the inquiries and replies on either side; and, if anything could have added to their pleasure, it was the mutual discovery that each contemplated a tour into southern Germany, and to spend the winter in Italy. The proposition that Claude should join the party was at once made and accepted; and, while listening to the voice of true friendship, so rarely heard in the crowded halls of fashion, and thus opening to himself a prospect of freedom from the sad thoughts and humiliations which had so long oppressed him in Berlin, Claude already felt the weakness of yielding to despondency, and the certainty of finding contentment, if not happiness, elsewhere; even after having parted for ever from the object of his now so deep but melancholy love. It was not long before Denham had drawn from his ingenuous friend a clear account of what had happened since his last letter— of his almost formal dismissal by the Carolan family— of the malignant enmity of Elkington and his dark threats—and of the challenge and its refusal. He looked grave for a moment, and said, “You must get away at once if you are determined to suffer this puppy to calumniate you with impunity; Vol. II.—B and I fear also, lest, in some personal encounter, you might be placed in an awkward position.” “I fear nothing,” said Claude, “and I will certainly make no open demonstration of a desire to avoid him. I have offered to Carolan all the necessary explanations respecting the falsehood of his charges, and I have openly pronounced them false. I am yet more than ever firmly persuaded, that a man who has nothing to reproach himself with, should, where legal redress is not advisable or possible, point to the tenour of a blameless life as the sole reply to passing slanders.” Denham shook his head. “I have a great mind,” said he, “and, were it not for Mary, I would make him eat his words myself. Even as it is—” “No, Charles,” said Claude. “Remember you are a husband, and have no right to risk your wife's happiness, whatever you may choose to do with your own.” “Well, then, let us get off as soon as possible; we will take a glance at Berlin, and arrange our route for the summer; but I shall expose this unprincipled ruffian—that is my duty, wherever I speak of him; and as for meeting such a blackleg, for he is nothing more, he must wash his hands clean from the stain of fraud upon them before he has a right to call upon me.” Mrs. Denham now entered, and welcomed Claude with a warmth which proved how sincerely he was esteemed where he was really known. With Mrs. Denham there was also a lovely little girl, her niece, whom these amiable people had adopted. Nothing could be more delightful than the attachment and sunshiny happiness which reigned continually in this little circle, where intelligent and cultivated minds were inspired by the best impulses that adorn the heart and character. Mrs. Denham was an extremely lovely person of three or four-and-twenty, with all the ease and charm of a fashionable woman, without her frivolity or pretension. The marriage had been one of mutual attachment, and now presented the agreeable spectacle of a union surrounded by a milder but deeper light of affection, in proportion as the mere illusions of love gave place to a truer knowledge of character, and a soberer but not less delightful appreciation of their relative position and merits. The little Ellen was an orphan, the daughter of Denham's brother, who had died without any fortune. She had been carefully educated, and was beloved and watched over with the tenderest care; and it was to recruit her health, which had been somewhat impaired by the closeness of her application at school, that she was permitted to enjoy the present excursion. It was, however, by no means a loss of time, as Mrs. Denham was peculiarly calculated to instruct her young charge in all the necessary branches, and, while she led her willing feet along the path of knowledge, to teach her correct habits of thinking and observing, to awaken and guide in her heart those impulses, and to instil into her mind those principles, without which the brightest talents and the fairest charms are worthless and dangerous. For several days Claude occupied himself with his friends, in seeing the town and its environs. Now they walked in the beautiful gardens at Charlottenbourg, and now strolled through the royal grounds and gorgeous palaces of Potsdam, where the numerous tokens of the great monarch, philosopher, soldier, author, and statesman, whose spirit had recently quitted the earth, interested them extremely. All the curiosities usually shown to travellers were diligently explored, and many a merry party they had in the course of these toilsome but exciting labours; and in the afternoon, a drive around the Park or an evening at the opera furnished new variety to their amusements, and new and agreeable topics of conversation. In these constant rounds of occupation Claude almost forgot his situation. He found in the circle which gathered every day at dinner, that ease and unreserved gayety of private life, which pleased him more than all the brilliancy and pomp of fashion amid which he had spent the winter. Here all things appeared in their true value. Rational standards of right and wrong were the criterions of action, and the heart expanded and opened its faculties in the warm temperature of friendship and the sober light of nature. At length the day of departure was fixed, and all the necessary arrangements completed. On the afternoon previous they sat down to dinner for the last time in Berlin, and it was late ere they ceased the lively conversation to which all that they had seen and all that they expected to see gave rise. “Well, here's a long adieu to Berlin,” said Denham, “and a health to those who remain behind, except that scoundrel Elkington. You may be right, Claude, in letting him off; but, were I in your place—” “That's Charles exactly,” said Mrs. Denham; “I do believe he has a secret pleasure in being shot at. I am glad you are going with us. I am sure, Mr. Wyndham, you are too calm and reflective to suffer passion to hurry you into actions against right and reason. Some of your friends are not by half so sensible.” “Come, come, my love,” said Denham, “no scandal.” “Aunt Mary is angry because uncle Charles was going to fight a duel,” said Ellen, “before we left home.” “How dare you,” said Charles, laughing, “betray your uncle in such a heinous offence? So tell Mr. Wyndham now the whole story, as a punishment, and see what he will say to it.” “A man said uncle Edward was no gentleman,” said Ellen, coming up to Claude, who drew her towards him, much pleased with her countenance and manner; “and uncle Charles challenged him, and then the person begged his pardon, and said he was a gentleman.” “To be sure,” said Charles, laughing, “and that illustrates my old opinion. Now there was a case, Claude, where no alternative was left. Upon the fame of a gentleman no one should breathe a doubt. It should be distinctly understood that such an insult must be answered, and then there would be fewer evil tongues. If you permit a man to question your character as a gentleman with impunity, when will you stop him? from one word he will advance to broader ones—from invectives to distinct charges— and from them to—a blow, perhaps. If you are prepared, under any circumstances, to call a person to account, why not begin at the beginning? Why not refuse to permit the slightest indignity? Principle upon such a subject would be very well if you could carry it out. But since, in case of the last provocation, you must seek redress, the—” “But I do not see why you must,” said Mrs. Denham. “What, even where a blow—” “Even a blow,” said she, “cannot excuse a man for committing an action which is at once foolish and wicked.” “There, my love,” said Denham, “you must excuse me; a blow admits of no compromise or reflection; a blow is the worst insult which one man can inflict upon another. A blow I bear from no man; at the foot of the altar—from the hand of the priest or of a king, it must be punished. It puts consequences out of the question. It demands that every consideration in life should give way to an honourable, instant, and reckless demand for redress.” “And yet our Saviour bore a blow,” said Mrs. Denham, “and mere mortals have had the greatness of mind to rise superior to such a humiliation, rather than commit a criminal or an unwise action. I do not see why a blow should be such a peculiarly unpardonable insult, or why, however much it merits proper retaliation and punishment, it should stand separate from other wrongs, and reduce him who has the misfortune to suffer it from the responsibilities and duties of a B 2 rational being and of a Christian to a mere madman. I do not see why an appeal to the laws may not be made in this case with as much propriety as in any other. A highwayman robs you of your money—a swindler defrauds you in a lawsuit—a man borrows money of you and refuses to pay—a person slanders you or your friends—an incendiary sets your house on fire—all these are wrongs, but you do not feel bound to abandon your interests here and hereafter for the sake of taking from the law the task of punishing the aggressors; but a frantic madman—perhaps inebriated, and not knowing what he does—dashes his hand into your face, and straightway you profess to have received such a stain in your character, such an injury in your reputation, as must be remedied by committing what is really a crime.” “It is infamy,” said Denham; “and what is life without honour?” “And how is honour compromised by a blow?” demanded Mrs. Denham. “Does it make you less honest or noble in yourself? Does it make you treacherous, impure, intemperate, or in any way abased or wicked? Does it alter your affections or violate your duties? Does it afflict you with a vice or deprive you of a virtue? for, remember, I am not requiring you to bear blows without that sensibility which preserves the proper pride and dignity of a man, or to bear them in any but a noble cause. How is a calm and virtuous mind, pressing on in an honourable career of wisdom, unfolding its powers, and occupied in strengthening and purifying itself and benefiting others—how is such a mind degraded by the touch of a thoughtless hand? Is it not an ennobling and almost a divine effort, which turns unresistingly from so rash and impotent an attack, and continues to occupy itself only with what is great and good? Be assured he has lived a doubtful or an insignificant life who is required to illustrate its purity or its courage by a duel. Believe me, my dear husband,” continued Mrs. Denham, with a tremulous voice, “existence is a mighty and mysterious gift. It comes from the hand of God himself. Perhaps we do not, with all our wisdom, know its true meaning. Do not seek to destroy that of others for any human passion. The provocation in your last moment will show small beside the crime; and reserve your own life for the duties attached to it. If a man be a coward, taking life for a blow will not give him courage. If he be not, enduring it will not make him one. How wisely might every young malapert of the present day, whose thoughts are of pistols, death, and eternity, on the slightest casual occasion, take a lesson from the calm old Greek, who said, `Strike, but hear me!”' “My sweet Mary,” said Denham, as he regarded the bright eyes and heightened colour of his wife with admiration, “you speak well—you speak eloquently— but you speak like a woman. Our Saviour, it is true, bore a blow, but our Saviour was a God; we are men.” “And yet, did we but know it,” said Mrs. Denham, “we have within us the power to follow in the foot-steps of that Divine Master, who descended to earth that we might imitate his example. If men would only study the spirit of that religion—if a few, even, would dare to think and act for themselves, and to present the sounding reply of an irreproachable life to all that attacked reputation—this—this, indeed, would be courage. Am I not right, Mr. Wyndham?” “I am certain,” said Denham, “that Wyndham, with all his self-control and determination, would consider himself bound to resent a blow to the last extremity.” “I do not see,” said Claude, “what there is in the blow of a frantic fool, to absolve from the rules of right and wrong, or to alter the tenour of a great soul and a rational mind. The extreme sensibility on this point is a mode of feeling—a remnant of barbarism. He who conducts himself as he ought to do, will rarely be in a position to receive a blow; and when in such a position without fault of his own, he discovers more courage in bearing than in blindly resenting it.” “Come,” said Denham, “you are cunning reasoners, both of you; but I suspect neither knows what the feelings and actions of a man would, or ought to be, on such an occasion. Theory is one thing, and practice another. And as for me, I really don't see the use of making ourselves uncomfortable by reasoning on matters which in no way concern us.” “There is this use,” said Claude, “that when a man has determined how he would act in certain cases, upon the occurrence of these cases his steps, instead of being committed to headlong passion, are guarded by the cool decision of his temperate moments, and he is saved by the hand of principle from plunging down a precipice.” “Well! well! we are too serious,” said Denham, gayly. “Come, fill your glass, Wyndham! let us leave blows and quarrels to those who are threatened with them. For my part, now I am a Benedict, I shall keep away from troubled waters. I may not determine to let any one strike me who pleases; and, if forced into a quarrel, I may not choose to sneak out of it; yet, to avoid a quarrel, I would do as much as any man. I hold with old Poloneus: “`Beware of entrance to a quarrel; but, being in, Bear it, that the opposer may beware of thee.' “Come, success to our new undertaking, and may we all live a thousand years!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER II. Claude now rose to leave the table. It was eight o'clock, and he had resolved to go this evening, for the last time, into society in Berlin. After all that had occurred, he did not wish to leave town clandestinely, but to take this occasion to bid farewell to such of his friends as were not alienated by the slanders of his enemy, and to steal one more look at her who filled his soul with tender anguish. He had not seen Carolan for some time, nor the countess, nor Ida. He knew that the challenge from Elkington, which he had refused, had already become the topic of conversation. The fierce little general, disappointed in his intention of proceeding in the duel, or of taking summary vengeance upon Claude for the result of his mission, and the little respect with which the messenger had been received, found some vent for his fury in spreading everywhere the news of his enemy's cowardice and disgrace. As gentlemen may be very ready to fight duels and blow other gentlemen's brains out, and yet be capable of wide deviations from veracity, we must not be surprised to find that the doughty general garnished his recital with embellishments; and he was a great talker and knower to everybody. According to his account, “Mr. Wyndham had insulted his friend Lord Elkington, by calumniating him to Count Carolan, with the view of breaking off his approaching marriage with Ida; that he had, accordingly, borne a message from Elkington, upon receiving which Mr. Wyndham had become exceedingly pale and alarmed; and that, after having refused to fight, although urged to it by provocations which no gentleman could endure, and still refusing, he, the general, took his, Mr. Wyndham's, nose between his, the general's, fore and middle fingers, and pulled the same; and that the operation had been performed with so little resistance on the part of the operatee, that he should have repeated it at short intervals, when not otherwise engaged, wherever the said Wyndham presumed to show the said nose in society, only he, the said Wyndham” (and in this part of the account the general gave such huge twists with his body, and such ghastly contortions of his wounded cheek, as to render the description extremely lively and impressive), “had had the meanness—the cowardice —the—” (and here he used to make a pause, in consequence of there not being any word in either the French or German language exactly strong enough to convey the full extent of his contempt for such conduct) “to go to the police and complain of a threatened assault; thus meanly and basely, and in a most ungentlemanly manner, preventing his being shot, or, at least, horsewhipped in the street the next morning, as, but for this, would have been the case.” The world at large are not unlike a flock of sheep in respect to the facility with which they may be induced to follow any one who undertakes to lead, especially in some unjust act or foolish opinion; and the general, by his earnest manner of censuring Claude for not permitting himself to be shot, induced most of his hearers to conclude that the act had been totally unwarrantable, and unworthy of a gentleman. This accusation, combined with the charges already in circulation against our hero, had completed his disgrace; and he was now almost universally set down as a person of no character, who had impudently thrust himself into society; in short, a mere “chevalier d'industrie.” Several expressions of Count Carolan sanctioned these opinions. That gentleman, on discovering that Claude had dared to lift his thoughts to his daughter, fancied himself the object of as deep an insult as one man could offer to another; and, once admitting into his bosom the feeling of revenge, it mastered his weak mind, and became his predominant desire. If he could have crushed him into the dust, he would have done so. The letter sent him by Claude, containing that of Denham's, he returned unopened, and Claude received it as he was dressing to go to Count N—'s. He felt the insult, but he had made up his mind as to the course he should pursue, and he hoped in a week to turn his back upon Berlin for ever. “Come what, come may,” thought he, “I will meet these gay crowds once more. I will steal one more look at that fair—fair face, which I am never to see again, and then—hail! the future, and the past—adieu!” While dressing, his servant brought him a newspaper, sent up by Denham. He unfolded it, glanced his eye across its pages, and was flinging it aside, when the name of the Earl of Beverly caught his eye, and he read the following: “Death of the Earl of Beverly.—We regret to be obliged to announce the death of the Earl of Beverly, at his princely residence at L—, on Monday morning. The earl, who had been previously improving in health, on rising in the morning at his usual hour, fell suddenly to the floor in a fit, and expired before any assistance could reach him. An express was instantly sent off to the Continent to acquaint Lord Elkington and Lady Beverly, who are at Berlin. “The late earl was born in 17—. In March, 17—, when only the Hon. Mr. Lawton, he married a Miss Carentz, a beautiful young orphan of Vienna. The match was one of inclination, but terminated unfortunately. A short time after their union, the bride, to whom he was attached with a fervour corresponding to his high powers of mind and peculiar ardour of character, quitted him, allured by the attractions of an ancient lover; and, after having afforded but too glaring evidences of a character singularly light, and a total disregard of her own honour and the peace of her husband, she carried with her a child not many months old, but neither the unfortunate infant nor its mother long survived; both having been lost at sea on a voyage to the West Indies. Having succeeded to the titles and estates of his father, the late —, he was subsequently created Earl of Beverly by his late majesty. After which he immediately married Miss Seymour, daughter of the distinguished General Seymour. Lord Elkington, now Earl of Beverly, the only son, is twenty-two years of age. He is daily expected with his mother from the Continent.” Claude read this paragraph with a singular interest. He felt almost as if Providence were unjust to raise the profligate duellist to opulence and honour, and to depress him, who had shown himself so ready to sacrifice even his reputation in the cause of right. How brilliant was now Elkington's prospect! The Earl of Beverly courted by all—his rank and wealth would gloss over the defects of his character. His gambling debts would be paid, and his misdemeanours hushed up. If Count Carolan before had been anxious for a union with him, he would now be much more so, and he would be little likely to listen to charges concerning him from one with whom he was already obviously offended. Ida would become the Countess Beverly. Blessed with everything to elate his spirits, and to swell his bold, bad heart with joy and triumph, he could go on for the future; perhaps, having no temptation to evil, he would endanger his reputation by no farther open acts of profligacy; while he himself, having openly branded him, would be regarded as a mean calumniator and a defeated rival. As these reveries passed through his mind, he found himself at the house of Count N—, the — minister. It was blazing with light and very crowded. It seemed all the world was there. Claude entered with a secret tremble at his heart, which belied his outward tranquillity. There are, perhaps, to a proud and noble mind, few ordeals more painful than that to which he had now voluntarily subjected himself; stranger as he was in Berlin, he had more of the support obtained by a long residence, and the consciousness that, whatever slanders might be circulated against him, enough of his real character must be known to create friends and defenders. The whisper—the doubt, is enough to shade the name of the stranger; and the open charges rung against him by Elkington, Le Beau, Lady Beverly, Thompson (for he had turned one of his bitterest detractors without the slightest apparent cause), and several others, almost entirely destroyed his standing. Few have the prudence or the benevolence to doubt a slander, or, at least, to omit to circulate it until it is clearly proved, and Claude saw, the moment he entered the door, that he was a proscribed man. The Count and Countess N—, however, greeted him with affability. He was in their house on their invitation, and they were, moreover, people of refinement and kindness. They had heard the accusations against him, but they also had formed a friendship with himself more intimate than the ordinary acquaintanceships of the saloons, and they perceived and respected in him a man of obviously superior mind and elegant deportment. They knew also Madame Wharton's opinion of him; and with the power of appreciating character possessed by so few, they esteemed her as she merited. They perfectly understood, too, that Carolan was a man of the feeblest possible understanding, and a heart entirely given up to vanity; that Le Beau was an unprincipled rascal, who presumed to be very important on the score of having fought duels, and that Elkington was a desperate libertine. People of sense and observation find these things out by a thousand various trifles, and Claude therefore, with them, stood as before. They respected and admired him, and were too intelligent to be led away by a vulgar love of scandal to believe evil at the whisper of those who were themselves far from pure. Claude even found both the count and his lady more affable than usual. By a kind of generosity so rarely discovered, they seemed resolved to support the weaker party; to mark distinctly and publicly their dissent from the general opinion, of which they were not ignorant, and to sooth the wounds which they rightly judged were to be inflicted upon the heart of their young friend on this evening. Keen was the appreciation of this conduct, and deep the gratitude felt by Claude; and it enabled him to regain his full self-command, and, perhaps, materially supported him through the principal incident to which he was subsequently subjected. It is thus often with us in our daily actions which have consequences we cannot foresee. Vol. II.—C When we do wrong, we cannot know what evil may follow; and when we do right, we little imagine the pleasure and blessing which it often proves afterward. It was with a cold heart that Claude left the side of his amiable hosts to stroll around the rooms. The same near-sightedness which had amused him so much when applied to poor Digby, he felt was by no means so entertaining when he experienced it himself. Many an eye was suddenly averted as it met his. Many a step turned away from his path. Some pretended not to see him; some coolly perceived his face without seeming to know him; a few seemed embarrassed by his presence, and as unwilling to hurt his feelings by an open slight, as to seem to sanction his equivocal standing and character by any greeting. One or two young ladies, who thought a man who could shrink from fighting a duel must be a perfect monster of vulgarity and cowardice, tossed their heads with unconcealed contempt as he passed near them; and one youthful male aspirant after the honours of the beau monde, finding that he might be impertinent without danger, took occasion to half recognise him, and then draw back and retire in a marked manner on his discovery of some sign of a salutation, boasting afterward that he had “cut him dead.” We are sorry to record that Mr. Thomson was among the shyest of those who thought it necessary to forget him entirely. For some time Claude wandered around the rooms, every one appearing to avoid addressing him. The effect of this upon him was visible in an increased paleness. Where was Lavalle? where was General St. Hillaire? Some accident had detained them. He felt that he would have given worlds to see the face of one friend — to have any one to talk to, that he might break the general coldness and silence which he appeared to bring with him wherever he went. He wandered on like a man in a dreadful dream. He could scarcely believe that, by the acts and villany of a single person, he had been so entirely ruined in the estimation of so many people. His isolation was more complete from the fact that, perceiving how much he was the object of odium, he did not like to subject to the attaintment of associating with him the few who, perhaps, had he addressed them as usual, would have replied with civility. Thus marked, as it were, by the proscription of the whole brilliant assembly, and by his pale countenance and haughty air a conspicuous person amid the laughing and pleasure-seeking crowds, he thought himself suffering the worst effects of his honest adherence to principle and the slander of his enemies, when Carolan and his family entered the room. Amid the many persons whom they saluted, the omission of him was conspicuous and generally remarked. The count looked at him a moment with disdain, and turned his back. The countess carefully avoided meeting his glance; and even Ida—upon whose beautiful countenance, now as pale as his own, he could not avoid fixing his eyes, in which all his pride and haughty indignation had not been able to prevent a moisture —even Ida turned silently away, and was led by a gentleman to a distant part of the room, without a word or a look. There are moments when the more we suffer the better able we are to endure, and this, for Claude, was one of them. He felt that to remain longer in a society, after so open an exposure of the estimation in which he was held, would be neither necessary nor delicate. He resolved, therefore, to retire; but, before doing so, to seek with Count Carolan a few moments' conversation. He therefore approached that gentleman, and with an air so calm and yet so evidently agitated that Carolan started at his sudden address. “Count Carolan, a word with you.” “Certainly,” said the count. “There is, I believe, no one in Madame de N—'s boudoir; may I beg your company there for a few moments?” The count turned rather pompously and followed. When they reached that remote room, they found it deserted. “What is your pleasure, sir?” said Carolan, haughtily. “To ask you what I have done to merit a condemnation without a hearing. I perceive, with indignation and surprise, that my reputation has been destroyed by calumny. I could drag the slanderer to light, and make him pay with his life the penalty of his falsehood; but that would punish the falsehood, and not disprove it. Neither is Lord Elkington one who would hear with candour what I have to say. To you, sir, I appeal, from a sense of duty, as having been my first friend in Berlin; and I beg to know of what I am accused and what suspected; and I offer, publicly or privately, to submit my life, actions, and character to any scrutiny you may desire. I do not ask your friendship; but I desire you will, by your words and conduct, refute intimations against my character, which I offer you the means of knowing to be above reproach.” “I had hoped Mr. Wyndham had discovered a more manly mode of righting his injured fame. Gentlemen settle these things in a shorter, and, you will excuse me for adding, in a more honourable way,” said Carolan. “Pray spare me your insinuations, sir,” said Claude, mildly. “I am not here to quarrel, but to explain to you your injustice towards me. If this injustice is wilful, I shall not resent it; but if it is an error, I am willing to explain the calumnies of Elkington.” “Stop, sir! stop, sir! I shall hear nothing against my friend. I deem it proper to admit him into my family; and I presume I am the best judge of my own companions and my own affairs.” “Indeed,” said Claude, remembering that he was addressing the father of Ida, and thus, in some degree, repressing the disgust which the pompous, arrogant manner and unreasonable remarks of his companion excited; “indeed, sir, in offering my defence of myself, I am obliged to place in your hands once more a letter concerning Elkington, which—” “Stop, sir—stop! I will hear nothing upon that subject. I presume, sir, you are aware that my daughter has chosen him as her husband; and, though you have been unprincipled enough—” “Count Carolan!” “To attempt to win her affections, and to allure her from her father's house—” “I? I do most solemnly protest—” “Stop, sir! I am acquainted with the whole; and I deem it proper, since you have sought this interview, to state, sir, that, when I took you up—a friendless, nameless person—too hastily, as it seems—I thought I discovered in you something worth my encouragement. You are nothing, sir! It was by my stamping you that you have alone been received into society; and, having been mistaken in you, I must—from a high and imperative sense of duty—I must drop you in the most marked manner; any application from you, sir, will be entirely useless.” There was an insufferable conceit in the manner in which this was said, which made Claude's blood boil in his veins. It was a thousand times more difficult to endure patiently than the straightforward injuries of Elkington, or the capricious near-sightedness of Lady Beverly. He could not help wishing in his heart that he could call out to the field, and plant, at twelve paces from the muzzle of a good pistol, an insolence and pomposity so inexpressibly provoking. But the father of Ida would have been safe from an angry reply, even had he been influenced by no loftier consideration in governing his passions. He therefore replied, “If Count Carolan supposes my present suit as an application for his aid in enjoying the pleasures of the Berlin society, he mistakes me greatly. I complain that, by a sudden withdrawal of the respect which, from whatever motive, you have been pleased to honour me with, people are left to form erroneous opinions C 2 respecting me. I offer you proof that such opinions are false; and I appeal to your generosity and sense of honour not to inflict upon me the injury which you have now the power to do, at least without satisfying yourself that you have cause.” “I presume, sir, that I know how to take care of my own honour without your advice; and as to generosity, that which I have already shown towards you has been so ill returned, that I must reserve it hereafter for a more worthy object, and one free from the charges currently believed against you, sir.” “Will you tell me what are the charges reported against me?” “Ask nothing of me, sir. I presume I shall be ready to render an account of my actions to those who have a right to call on me.” “If, then, sir,” said Claude, his patience giving way before the insufferable pomposity and insolence which appeared in every word and gesture of his former patron, “your opinion is formed without cause, and adhered to against proof, I can only conclude that, in seeking to change it, I have placed upon it more than its real value.” “Do you mean to insult me?” said Carolan, turning very pale. “I protest,” said Claude, after a moment's reflection, “I am wrong to forget that you have rendered me kindness which should ever seal my lips. I cannot but think, in refusing me the opportunity to lay my character before you, you do me wrong; but I did not mean to fail in my respect towards you; and,” for the image of Ida floated through his mind, “Count Carolan, before we part, I beg your pardon.” “No, sir. You intend to insult me.” “I assure you—” “No, sir—stop! You cannot deceive me. I see it is your intention to insult me. I am justly served, sir, for my imprudence in taking up persons without examining who and what they are! I shall hereafter, sir, be more on my guard. And I shall deem it a high duty to look with suspicion upon all strangers ere I give them my countenance in society.” Tired of contending against these characteristic remarks—disgusted beyond measure, even more with the manner than the matter—and unwilling, from various considerations, to resent, Claude remained silent, inwardly hoping that a fool might thus be best dealt with; but even silence was no refuge against the displeasure of Count Carolan. “Go, sir!” said that gentleman. “I recommend you to abandon a class of society for which you are fitted neither by your education nor your fortune; but, before you go, you will be so good, sir, as not to forget that a bill for £50 has been cashed by my banker at your request.” Astonished at this extraordinary speech, Claude, with an indignant heart, and the strongest possible desire to horsewhip him, turned in silence, and, with a burning spot in his cheek, withdrew, with the determination to retire instantly to his house, and leave Carolan, wife and daughter, without another word. He had done all that good sense demanded to re-establish his character; and all, through the malice of Elkington, and the stupid pomposity and conceit of Carolan, had been in vain. Accordingly, he turned his back upon Carolan, who had never appeared to him so ridiculous and disgusting, and approached the door which led to that of egress. He had reached the last antechamber, lost in thoughts of no tender nature, when he was astonished, not to say startled, to behold Elkington planted directly in the doorway through which alone he could pass to the street; and, on the appearance of Claude, a low laugh announced a fiendish delight, which announced no good. Claude stopped and gazed a moment with surprise upon the features, attitude, and dress of his enemy. He was not in the ordinary habiliments of a ballroom, but wore a surtout and boots. His cravat was loosely tied—his wristbands unfastened—his vest but partly buttoned, and his hair dishevelled. His attitude was motionless as that of a snake before he springs. On a nearer glance at his features, he perceived that his face was much flushed, and his lips stained with wine. There was a certain air of swagger very different from his usual elegant quietness of manners; and his eyes were fixed on Claude with a fury which probably neither wine nor passion could have produced separately, but which was the combined effect of both. Behind him stood little General Le Beau. The peculiarities in the dress and manner of Elkington, however singular, were less so than his appearance at all, at this time, in such a scene; the news of his father's illness having but so recently arrived, and some of the journals having even formally announced his death. Claude saw that a premediatated attack awaited him if he advanced, and, had it been possible, despite the sneers which such a course might have excited, he would have returned to the drawing-rooms rather than engage in a scuffle which, from the desperate character of his foe, might be a fatal one; but he saw that it was the intention of Elkington to pursue him if he retreated, as certainly as to assault him should he proceed. He therefore paused, not knowing for a moment what to do. “So, sir,” said Elkington, “I have sought you at your hotel—I have sought you through the streets—I have sought you here—and here you are! I learn you are about to quit Berlin. You have deeply wounded my honour—you have slandered and insulted me. I have demanded of you the satisfaction of a gentleman, which you have refused. Sir, take this—and may it burn on your forehead for ever!” He stepped deliberately forward, and with his clinched fist struck him a violent blow in the face. For a moment Claude was stunned. He did not think of returning it. He started back and covered his face with his hands. He seemed blasted with thunder. He heard several voices exclaim, “Ha! a blow!” in tones of surprise and horror. His heart stood still. His reason left him. His principle against taking human life flashed upon him as a mockery. He stirred. It was to sacrifice, and tear to pieces the being who had brought this spell upon him. He found some one had grasped his arms and held him back. Fire fell from his eyes. He thought their glance alone could kill, and he turned them, that they might do so on his victim. He beheld him standing there—very pale, but smiling; a sneer—as a devil—on his face; and his extended finger pointing at him. A sense of agony—of ruin—of utter, interminable, irretrievable shame and despair filled all his being. Never had he known the fearful energies of his nature. Never before had he dreamed what it was to receive a blow! Some moments elapsed, he knew not how long. He was deprived of the power of motion. Invisible hands held him. He could not tell how—nor who—nor how long —nor by what tremendous power, his strong impulse to leap forward was withheld. He wanted motion— a weapon—a pistol—anything which would destroy— crush—strike dead. He was first somewhat recalled to reason by the low laugh of Elkington, who advanced and said, “My card, sir! You know where I am. I shall be happy to hear from you at your earliest leisure.” “To-night—to-night,” said Claude. “When you please, sir.” “Lord Elkington, you are an infamous scoundrel,” cried a voice from the side of Claude. It sounded like Denham's, but he scarcely attended to it. He was still as one in a dream. “How! who is that?” demanded Elkington. “It is I, insolent ruffian!” said Denham, stepping up. “You know my friend is no duellist, and the blow you have struck, may it recoil upon your own forehead and sink into your own heart. How dare you, sir—your hands stained with dishonesty—your name—” Elkington now, in his turn, showed signs of trepidation; but he said, “I did not expect to see you here; but I have an account to settle with you also, unless you are as whining a coward as your friend.” “I will meet you when your hands are clean from—” “If you are a man,” muttered Elkington, desperate with fury, “you will meet me at once!” He lifted his hand and hurled a blow upon the forehead of Denham. The object of this unexpected attack sprung upon him, but Le Beau rushed between. “Elkington,” said Denham, his face livid with passion, “you have succeeded. You shall hear from me,” and left the room. This scene was very rapid in its occurrence. A general interference now took place. Elkington retired. Claude was released. The crowd had rushed from the inner apartments at the noise of the brawl; Claude was surrounded by them. They opened to give him room as he passed out. He found himself in the open air; alone, burning like an evil spirit just out of its abode of fire.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER III. A BLOW. This was the blasting thought which filled Claude's mind as he bent his steps he scarce knew whither. He was in a state of agitation which he had never experienced before. He had no longer any power over his reason. His thoughts were tossed to and fro by a whirlwind. He felt, for the moment, that he would commit any crime, could he but tear the heart out of Elkington's bosom! He did not recognise himself. He appeared in his own eyes a demon, so dreadfully does unrestrained passion metamorphose even the most rational. All his calm grandeur—his sense of right—his reasoning powers—his resolutions of duty—his dependance on God—they were all gone. There was the same difference between his mind then, and as it usually was in its peaceful moments, as between the tall and gently advancing ship, with sails set, each rope in its place, obedient to the helm, and rising and falling on the summer waves; and the same vessel in a fearful tempest, its sails rent to pieces, its masts down, its rudder broken, and its deck swept by huge waves which threaten instant destruction. He could only think one thought — he could only breathe one word—A blow! He thought to seek Elkington and sacrifice him on the spot. He resolved to destroy himself instantly. He found himself at length at home. He went to his room, he flung himself on his bed, but it heaved beneath him, and fire flashed from his eyes and temples, and faces of a laughing crowd jeered and grinned around, and the finger of the scornful Elkington pointed at him, and people shouted in his ear in all sorts of tones, “A blow! a blow!” The voice of hate muttered it; it was shrieked as if by despair; friendship seemed to utter it with an inflection of inquiry and incredulity; it came to him with the laugh of childhood and from the scornful lips of women—“A blow! a blow!” “It is a dream!” he murmured, and he arose from his bed. The heat in his body was intolerable. The very air he breathed seemed hot and burning. He threw off his coat, his vest; he unloosed his cravat and shirt-collar, and sat down by the open window. But he could not sit still—he could not lie—he could not walk. The narrow room oppressed him by its limits; and he strided to and fro, turning against the walls as a wearied and enraged lion paces the small floor of his iron cage, with a tread and a heart that should be upon the burning desert, or the unexplored, unbounded wood. At length he threw himself upon the naked floor, conscious that movement only fanned the fire within him. “A blow—a blow! Let me think of it!” And, for a moment, the whirl and tumult of his mind subsided a little, and gave place to something like continuous reflection. “No,” he thought, “it is a dream—that blasting stroke upon my brow—a dream?” He raised his hand to his face. He became conscious of a dim sense of pain now for the first time, and, on passing his fingers over it, he found the eye much swollen. He closed the other, and looked out of the window with that one injured. It was nearly deprived of sight. A vague appearance of light was all he could distinguish. The beautiful transparent air—the bending sky—the moon riding calmly over all the shocks of earth—they were lost and fused together, without beauty or separate distinctness. The idea struck him that perhaps the wound was irreparable; perhaps the eye was blind. No! no! it was no dream! It was a bitter, deliberate, public, burning insult. It was the most blighting act of scorn and shame—the fullest of humiliation—the most palpable and memorable—that which could be the least overlooked, or pardoned, or forgotten by mankind—of all the wrongs that one human being could inflict upon another. It was irreparable. He who bestowed it could not undo it. Time—distance—virtue —could not wash it out. It was a stain eternal. All great Neptune's ocean could not clean its blackened traces—there was but one thing— He started to his feet. It was blood. It was that great, mysterious, sacred specific, the touch of which blasts ordinary hands— the very half-forgotten stain of which betrays ancientest crime—drags the murderer to light—raises the very dead out of their fleshless graves, till vengeance has had her banquet. The spot upon his forehead could only be effaced—the flame in his heart could only be quenched—by blood! And he sat down and rested his elbows on a table, and leaned his throbbing temples on his fists. “Oh God!” he suddenly exclaimed, dropping on his knee; “teach me—guide me—save me—my heart is wild—my hand is lifted—give me some sign!” He strove to pray—as was his custom on occasions where his own sense of right wavered. But his heaving imagination could form no address to the Supreme Being. That serene power that sits above the clouds seemed itself to have deserted him in his deep degradation. He could not utter a prayer, or conceive one. Strange things flitted before his eyes, and flapped their wings in his face; and laughter, and shrieks, and hisses rose once more around him, till the dark room seemed crowded with evil spirits, in the full ecstasy of their orgies over a lost one. He leaned again his forehead upon the table, when suddenly a voice, as if of one of these fiends, seemed to say, “Yes, you are a coward! It is craven fear that holds your hand. You are a canting, trembling hypocrite. You deceive yourself with names of virtue and illusions of religion—abject—disgraced—wretched creature! No one else is deceived. Elkington is a gallant fellow. You injured him like a scoundrel, and then fled from him like a coward. You are afraid to fight a duel. An unmanly sensibility and womanish effeminacy is the secret of your convenient principles —your puny virtue. Who made you a judge—a reformer—a prophet? Who gave you light to see, what none of the wise—the brave—the great can see? Who teaches you to distinguish between what is right and what is not—between what God commands and what he forbids? Why not fight a duel? It is the custom! It is a good custom. It is brave and manly. It unmasks cowards and sneaking hypocrites. Fool! look into your own heart, and see what its honest dictates Vol. II.—D tell you of a blow. Every fibre of your trembling frame quivered with it. Every faculty of your shrinking soul fainted at it. Nature rose against it. A blow! Since time began it is the badge of insult—the mark of shame. It is a curse full of the accumulated infamy of ages. The very beast turns at it. Its bodily pain is but a type and faint shadow of its moral ruin. Bear this one, and you will receive another—and another—and another. Who hereafter will honour you? who will love you? Outcast! the blood in your veins is water—your heart is faint — you are not a man—you have borne a blow!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER IV. “But I have not borne it,” said Claude. He rose and reached from his bookcase a pair of travelling pistols, and, placing them in his bosom, rushed from his house into the street. At first he knew not whether it was dark or light; whether the weather was fair or cloudy, nor had he any precise idea of what he intended to do, or where he meant to go. He had not walked far when he saw a man. He was a sentinel. For the first time in his life he felt unable to bear the eyes of a fellow-being. The swollen wound upon his face seemed a mountain, and he forgot everything but the desire to withdraw himself into solitude—darkness —and silence—away from the gaze of all—even were it in the grave. Then there came to him again, as he walked, startling thoughts of self-destruction. Only death could relieve him from the agony of his heart. He cast his eyes about him upon the surrounding objects — the long, quiet streets — the deserted squares — the silent houses — the soft, waving trees. He wondered to behold such tranquillity—such peace —after all his anguish. He walked beneath the soft branches with shame—he shrank from the moonlight reflected against the houses—the very pavement he seemed to tread on as an intruder—as a felon; and he looked around him like guilt, stolen in the night from its lurking-place—ashamed—and fearful of being seen. “Ah,” thought Claude, as a moment of calm reflection came to him with the soft air and balmy night-breeze, “little dreams he who, rude in nature, bad in heart, and feeble in understanding—without principle, feeling, or religion—with no restraints in this world, and no communings with the other—ah, little thinks the common, vulgar mind of the dread act he perpetrates when he launches a blow against a fellow-being.” He bent his steps towards his favourite Park. His thoughts now rolled through his mind less confusedly. He was no longer mad, but they had a deep and solemn motion. He passed through the tall Branden-bourg gate. The guard at his post looked at him; he shrank from his eye, and the man seemed inclined to stop him, but did not. “He sees,” said Claude, “humiliation in my very walk.” There is something in a night-ramble which restores the agitated soul to itself. He felt the rapid motion— the cool, sweet air abate, sooth, and calm the heat which till now had oppressed him. He penetrated into the beautiful recesses of the luxuriant wood. It was again a bright moonlight, and the scene touched him through all his agitation and awoke other feelings. “Receive me!” he said, “pure shades; receive the outcast, now doubly outcast. Receive the stained, the shamed, the fallen! Shrink not from me, ye flowers, nor turn away your protecting arms, ye calm old trees, who stand for ages through sun and storm, and never know what he who steals beneath your path knows to-night. When last I walked here I was as pure and scatheless as yourselves; now I am apart from other men, unless I dip my hands in blood! Oh, that it were for ever night! Oh, could I remain for ever here, alone with you—where no blood flows at my feet, and no hisses sound in my ears. A blow! a blow! Poor, poor Rossi! He went mad; and it was this same hand that struck him too. God! when he told me of it, I little knew what a blow was. Why did not the lightning arrest that rash hand ere it cast on me this fatal misery. I should have killed him, but I was held —for good or for evil. Killed! what if I had killed him? What is killing? what is life? what is death? Will not God pardon it? Can I be punished for not bearing a burden beyond my strength? and, after all, who says killing is not right? The Holy Scriptures call out `blood for blood;' and is not a blow blood? Is it not worse? We have killed each other since Abel's time—daily and hourly. It is our nature. It enters into the plan of Providence. All things kill. The soft dove snatches the golden insect—the hawk pierces the dove—the lion tears his prey—the boar has his tusk—the serpent his sting. This sweet forest, so fair to view, is but a scene of continual massacre. The microscope, that discovers animalcules invisible to the naked eye, finds them killing each other. I have surely been led away by idle theories of human excellence. I have set myself apart as better than my fellow-beings. I am not. I do not wish to be. God made us mortal. I will kill this man. I will meet him—and one of us shall die. Perhaps, now, he will not—then still I will kill him. To-morrow—a week hence — a year — twenty years — standing amid his friends—asleep—awake—in bed—in the fields—in the dance—at the very altar, on his knees in repentant prayer—I will kill him—I will have his heart's blood!” He paused. The last words had been spoken aloud. They sounded like the imprecations of a demon escaped from hell, amid these soft glades and perfumed bowers. “Alas! what am I become? What bloody and dark demon has entered my body? Is this indeed honour? Is this duty? Our Redeemer suffered a blow! * * * * But that sublime tradition which paints the wandering Jew—there is meaning in it. * * * * * * * Oh God!” he continued, after pacing on yet farther, “I am lost. I acknowledge myself weak. I know not what I say or do. I am rushing blindly upon murder—upon death. The very fiends in the shape of human reason seem goading and urging me on. Alas! human reason is vain. I have listened to it too long. As yet my hands are pure from blood—as yet I do not stand before the throne of Heaven, uncalled but by my own passion. There is a higher power—I appeal to Him. I will not decide in my rashness. What do I care for man's opinion?” He lifted his hands and eyes to Heaven. It was near morning, and the sky was singularly transparent. He gazed breathless upon its quiet, eternal fields— the serene order of its glittering worlds—the hushed groups of stars — the moon pure, high, bright, and calm as the virtue which he had forgotten—as the innocence he had nearly thrown away. A dark cloud, of which the summit was piled up, mass above mass, like the silver Pyrenean cliffs above the blue Mediterranean, and whose base, black and definitely marked against the radiant air, lay stretched like a huge rock in a summer deep, gave to that upper world of light a new and awful aspect. As he gazed a sudden breeze came softly rushing over the tree-tops—kissing the murmuring leaves—reaching the face of the half-maddened being below—cooling his brow, and cheek, and heart—lifting the hair from his hot forehead—and wafting to his senses and to his soul, in a cloud of perfume, a consciousness of love—of hope—of life—of peace—of Heaven. At the same moment large tears rose to his burning eyelids and rolled down his cheeks; and, throwing himself upon the ground—alone, in that silent wood—unseen but by watchful stars—the proudest spirit that ever walked the globe bent to earthly anguish, and he wept, convulsively, like a child. D 2 Oh, Elkington! Could a wretch like thee bend that brow to the grassy ground, and shake with almost fatal pangs a heart which was to thee as the floating eagle to the howling cur? Thou hast triumphed—but beware! The triumph of guilt is a wrong against Heaven. The good man is the child of God, and God is omnipresent, and he is around us—in the very air— when we know it not. There is a blessing in tears. They are waters from Heaven, and they cleanse the soul to its pristine peace and purity. “It is not right,” muttered Claude, “to take human life for human passion. Shall I not leave the task of punishing to the sublime Being who rules the universe? Is he absent? is he powerless?” A peal of thunder burst over the starting earth ere the last word had left his lip; at the same moment the lightning darted with a blinding intensity. The tremendous volume of sound paused after the first shock —rolled on—paused—went on and on again—crushingly—as if annihilation itself had come upon mankind; and repeating several times its appalling reverberations —broad as the air, and apparently stirring the earth from its very orbit—lost itself threateningly, but calmly, as if amid the vastness of other spheres. Claude had not yet moved when a torrent came rushing down, and he was drenched to the skin; when he raised his head, the sky was wrapped in utter darkness. The wind swept over the wood, bending the tallest trees, and twisting their gnarled limbs till they groaned as if with fear and pain. The peal was followed by another, and so close and heavy that the instinct of self-preservation occupied his mind, to the exclusion of the subject which had so deeply agitated him. He hastened out of the Park into the broad road, where he was less in danger than among the trees. There is something in a good drenching which deadens human passions, and shows how weak and idle are even some of those words which make us commit deeds irreparable. The floods which drenched him were delicious, and cooled his fever. He breathed more freely, he trod more firmly; and, if the truth must be added, at a considerably swifter pace than he generally adopted. His course was bent also towards the gate, and he reentered the town. The rain, almost as suddenly as it had commenced, ceased, and a fissure appeared across the masses of black clouds which obscured the heavens. The dispersion of the vapours was so extremely rapid, that, even thrilled as he was by the incident which had just occurred, it fastened his attention. Forming themselves into separate piles, the clouds broke apart in all quarters, leaving the blue void stainless, and the stars glittering with unwonted brightness. Then the whole air, earth, and heaven were suddenly illuminated by a soft radiance. A massive breadth of vapour had passed from before the moon, and she broke out full orbed and almost light as day, while each torn fragment of silver cloud disappeared entirely, and the air became as still as the heaven. “Oh God,” said he, “I worship thee in thy temple, I call upon thee for aid. May this be to me an emblem of my own soul. Its passions, however tremendous, belong to earth; its calm hopes to Heaven. I commit myself to thee.” And his soul now poured itself in prayer, which seemed to rise unimpeded to the Throne of Mercy. He had implored a sign, and Heaven had granted it. The serenity of nature taught him by its example to sit serene after the mildest storm, which the same hand that conjured up could waft away, and that no tempest could reach the fair arrangement of right and truth. Slowly he wandered to his home. No weakness disturbed his spirit or his intellect. He had made up his determination to pass the indignity he had received in silence. The mortal body was subdued and ever mastered by the superior mind. At the word of reflection and of religion the hot blood flowed cool and placid through his frame. His obedient pulse played temperately, and all his soul was peace.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER IV. As he entered his hotel, the morning had not begun to break, although it was near the hour. To his astonishment he found the front door ajar, and two horses saddled, and held by Beaufort, who was easily distinguished by the lamplight. On entering, the door of Denham's room was also open. He thought it strange, and stopped a moment. A light step sounded within. He listened. It was a man's. Was Denham up? was he ill? Perhaps his wife—or the lovely little girl? If he should knock! he might disturb them. He approached. Denham was standing within, with his back to him, in a riding-coat, boots, and spurs, completely dressed. He shook violently, bending his head to his outspread hands. Then he stepped forward breathlessly, noiselessly, towards his bedroom door. As he did so, Claude caught a full view of his countenance in a mirror. It was as white as ever lay bound with linen in a coffin. His gaze was fixed on an object in the adjoining apartment. Extremely shocked, Claude advanced and followed with his eyes those of his friend. He started, however, at what there met his view, and was about retiring, for he found himself gazing upon the face of Mrs. Denham, tranquilly sleeping. A kind of bewilderment held him chained to the spot. The lovely sleeper was apparently lost in a pleasant dream. She was very beautiful. Her long hair lay in a kind of charming negligence around her face—her hand had fallen over her head—her cheeks were rosy—her lips touched with a smile. A happiness—a beauty—a placid peace gave to her countenance the loveliness of a seraph. Denham approached her—leaned over her. Again he shook violently. He bent his lips near hers, but did not touch them, and then turned away. He appeared to feel no surprise on seeing Claude. He seized his arm, and they hurried into the hall. “How late is it?” said Denham. “Daybreak.” “Already?” “Certainly. Great God! my friend, what is the meaning of this?” Denham turned as if startled by the sound of his voice, and now recognised him. “What, Wyndham!” “Yes. What is the matter? Why is Beaufort at the door? The horses—your dress—where are you going?” “You don't know?” “No!” “Adieu, my friend.” He turned very pale, and silently pointing with his inverted thumb to his room, “Claude, I commit her to your care. God help you—good-by!” “But, where? who? what?” stammered Claude. For so completely had he been stunned by the last night's scenes, that no trace of Denham's interference and its consequences had struck his attention. As his friend broke away, and he heard the sound of horses' feet driven at a rapid gallop over the pavement, a dim, dreamy idea of Denham—and hot words—and he knew not what, came over him. It seemed the recollection of a dream. Denham, then, had been implicated in his quarrel, and was gone to fight a duel. To fight for him, perhaps. The thought affected him more terribly than all his own pangs. He rushed to the door. He went into the street. Nothing was to be seen. The pale morning light was broadening over the heaven. One or two street-passengers were already out—labourers going to their toil—milk-women with their little dog-carts. He went out and looked in the direction in which he had heard the horses' feet. Nothing was to be seen of the fugitives. He returned to the hotel. The waiters were stirring. He spoke to a boy, and asked if he had seen any one pass. No, he had seen nothing. He suspected nothing. And Claude suddenly thought of the police, and instantly set off with the determination to call in their aid. As he went into the street again, a young boy came along, singing aloud. His face was round and rosy, his gait careless and thoughtless, his eyes bright, clear, and happy-looking. Ah, boyhood! how its recollections and an appreciation of its sweet exemption touched his soul. He went on. Every common thing looked strange to him, for death was in his thoughts. A maid was washing windows and humming an air; a man drove his cart by with a crack of the whip; in the building next the police, an old blind man had commenced his rounds, and was playing a merry tune on his organ; a bill—“Furnished rooms to let”—hung over the door. He hastened on. The large doorway was closed. The great gates and little door were equally closed and fastened. He rang—no one came. He rang again and again. At last the door sprang open. He went in. The large, dirty hall was empty. All the doors around were closed. That one where he had entered to lay his complaint against Le Beau was also shut. He rang and knocked—no one came. Did they know his deep impatience? Did they know death and life depended on their steps? He waited there half an hour. At length a rough-looking bumpkin came in out of the court, scratching his uncombed head, and gaping at him. “Where are they—where are the police?” “Nein! nein!” said the man, shaking his head. “Can I see no one here?” “Nein! nein!” “It's shut?” “Ja!” “How can I see them? Where?” “Eight o'clock!” “Not before? Can't you tell me where to find them?” “Nein! nein!” said the man; and, taking out a flint and steel, he drew from his pocket his pipe, lighted it, and went leisurely out of the front door. Every attempt made by Claude to see the police was vain, and he was about returning to the hotel, when he suddenly thought of Elkington. What if he went to his hotel! He determined to do so, notwithstanding the reluctance, the repugnance he felt to show himself there or anywhere among his fellow-men; farther, he remembered again that he bore the evidence on his brow of the insult inflicted upon him the preceding evening. He went, and gave the servant his card for Lady Beverly. “She is asleep,” said Scarlet, bluntly. He begged she might be awakened. “Impossible,” said Scarlet. “It affects the life of her son!” “Perhaps so,” said the man. “What do you mean, you scoundrel?” said Claude. “Come, come,” said Scarlet, “a civil tongue, if you please; you've got a whole eye yet, and you'd better keep it if you know when you're well off.” “I will go myself,” said Claude, “to Lady Beverly's door. She cannot know what's going on.” He stepped forward. The man laid a brawny hand upon his arm, and coolly clinched the other fist. “I tell you what, my rum chap,” said Scarlet, “if it wasn't for mere shame's sake, I'd bung up that t'other eye of your'n in less than no time. I'd sarve ye as master did—good for nothing, cowardly poltroon you are—to let another man go out and get shot, all for avenging of your cuffs. If I couldn't be a better gentleman than that, I wouldn't be none, no how.” Claude grasped the fellow by the throat and dragged him a few steps with a force which greatly astonished him, who thought he had only a chicken to deal with; and his astonishment was not diminished when, just as he thought he was to receive a “drubbing,” Claude released his hold, and said, “Poor fellow! while your master goes unpunished, you ought to have free room. Let me see Lady Beverly, and here is my purse.” “I beg your pardon, sir,” said Scarlet, very respectfully; “but milady can't be seen. Indeed, she's not here—she's out of town.” “Out of town?” “Last night! gone! and not to come back! We're to follow in a day or two.” “I understand,” said Claude, with a sickening heart. “Your master is also out?” “Yes, sir,” said Scarlet, in a low tone. “And you are his confidential servant?” Scarlet was silent. “I will give you £10 if you will direct me to where he is before anything happens.” “I might take your money, sir,” said Scarlet, “but it wouldn't be of no use. It's too late. It's all over by this time.” “Great Heaven!” “It is, sir, that's certain. They be gone out now two good hours.” “And when did the arrangements take place?” “Last night. Master up and struck Mr. Denham —I believe the poor gentleman's name's Denham— ain't it, sir? and he's game too—true blood—no backing out there—up to the mark! It wasn't fifteen minutes, sir, afore he had a gentleman here, and in a half an hour the hull was settled. I hearn it all myself. I was ordered to stand and keep watch afore the door.” “And where is it they have gone?” “Oh, don't fret yourself, sir. It's impossible to help it. The poor gentleman's good stuff; but, Lord, sir! he might as well put his head into a forty-nine pounder when it's a gitten fired, as to go out with master. He never went out with a man yet without pinking him. The poor gentleman's tucked under the green sod an hour ago. I hope he haint got no family, has he, sir? These ere is awkward things in such cases; but when a man's called a `d—d rascal,' what ken he do, you know? How's your eye this mornin, sir?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER V. Claude went back to his hotel in a state of mind bordering on distraction, but it had the effect to divert him from the consideration of himself. It seemed that a fatal duel on his account, in return for an insult which he had declined to resent, was all that was necessary to sink him to the lowest depths in the world's esteem, if not in his own. But that was a less insupportable reflection than the situation of Mrs. Denham and the sweet little girl, who were, probably, yet locked in peaceful slumber, unconscious of the thunderbolt about to fall upon them. He would have gone again to the police, but he had no precise information to give, and he felt sure, too, that it was too late for interference. There was, however, still a hope. It was possible either that chance might interrupt the meeting—or that Elkington might fall—or that, if Denham should receive a wound, it might not be mortal. But then the utter recklessness of Denham—his knowledge of Elkington's affair with the cards—and the unerring skill, as well as remorseless character of the latter, recurred to him with an agonizing force. As he entered the hotel he saw that there was an unusual confusion. Several waiters were running to and fro. One of them came up to him quickly as soon as he saw him. “You had better go to Madam Denham.” Vol. II.—E “Has anything happened?” “Mr. Denham has gone off.” “And not yet returned?” “No.” He breathed again. He had felt an unutterable fear on approaching the house. “Thank God!” he said, “all may yet be well.” “The lady is in a bad way, sir; she's very ill.” At this moment a voice from a servant at the top of the stairs called out, “Has Mr. Wyndham come in yet?” “You'd better go to her, sir,” said the landlord. “I fear something very dreadful has—” Claude recovered from a momentary faintness, nerved his heart, and entered the room. All that he had imagined of horrible was surpassed by Mrs. Denham. She was pale as death itself. Her hair hung in disorder about her beautiful and lightly clothed person. Her eyes were distended with terror, and the little Ellen clung to her bosom, weeping aloud, and winding her arms around her neck affectionately, and repeating, “Dear sister, my dear, dear sister. He will come, he will come. He will indeed, indeed he will!” Mrs. Denham's eyes were perfectly dry and starting from her head. She looked an image of tragedy itself. The moment Claude entered she saw him, for her wild eyes were fixed on the door; she sprang up with an hysterical laugh, and, rushing upon him as a lioness on one who had robbed her of her young, she uttered, in tones that pierced his heart and froze his blood, the dreadful words: “Ah! and now then! where's Charles?” “He is—he is—” “Is he here? Is he here?” “No—not here—not this instant.” “Where is he, then? What have you done with him?” “My dearest madam—” “Is he alive? Is he dead?” “No, no—God grant — I hope—not—not dead,” muttered Claude, trembling beneath the powerful agitation of this scene. “Is he safe? Will he come? What do you know? Is there any hope?” “I think—I believe—” “What do you know? Speak—as before your God. If you deceive me!” Claude turned away, and, pressing his extended hand against his forehead, shook as one by the bed of the beloved and the dying. She released her hold on him, and her hands fell nerveless by her side. “Then he is dead. Oh God — oh God—I have often feared this.” She sank back into a chair. “Charles—my husband—it is a dream—it is impossible.” Claude approached her, and took her cold hand in his. “My dear friend, hear me. It is too late to deceive you as to what has occurred. Your husband has gone out to comply with a strange custom, but we have no news of him, upon my honour. It is very possible he he may return—alive—unhurt. Believe me, dearest madam, there are many reasons to hope—indeed, indeed there are.” “I'm sure there are,” said Ellen, climbing up and again winding her arms around her neck, and covering her lips, forehead, and face with kisses. “You do not know anything, then?” “Nothing.” “And he may return? His step may be heard—his beloved image may once more bless my eyes? Hark —hark”—her face lighted up with intense pleasure — “it is—it is—ha, ha! ha, ha!” She screamed with joy, and darted towards the door, which opened and admitted—a stranger. The shock was too much for the poor girl. She would have fallen at full length upon the floor had not Claude caught her on his arm. He lifted her to the sofa, and, consigning her to the care of the maid, turned to the new-comer. “Who are you, sir—and what is your message?” “Sir,” said the man, “I am a Commissioner of the Hotel. I have been sent to the lodgings of Lord Elkington with directions to let you know when he returned.” “And he has returned?” said Claude, in a low tone, and with a shudder of inexpressible horror. “He has.” “Alone?” “Alone.” There was a pause. The commissioner then added, “He will leave town to-night.” “Did you see him?” “I did, sir.” “What was he doing?” “He was at breakfast, sir.” “Breakfast?” “Yes, sir; he said the eggs were boiled thirty seconds too long.” “The eggs?” “And appeared in excellent spirits!” “Oh, it is certain,” said Claude, “Charles and he have settled it. I was sure—” The man shook his head. “What do you know?” said Claude. “Nothing.” Claude paused. “I will go—I will see him myself. I cannot endure this.” And he instantly set off for Elkington's lodgings.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER VI. “Lord Elkington is at home?” said Claude to Scarlet. “No, sir,” said Scarlet, touching his hat; “he has been home, but is now gone out again. I told you he'd come back!” “Has anything happened?” “Yes, a good many things has happened,” said the man; “things is always a happening!” “For God's sake, my good fellow, if you know anything!” “Egad, I know a good many things—but there's one thing I don't know. I don't know what right you've got to stand a questioning me in this here style about private affairs. Mum's the word! But master said you might see him if you called, and only you, or some one from you.” “Where is he, then? I will see him!” “Well, he's now at Count Carolan's, with several other people. Count Carolan gives a great `dejooney dong-song' to-day.” Claude instantly bent his steps towards Carolan's. It was too early for the general company to arrive, but several carriages were before the door. He entered and mounted the stairs. They were arranged with flowers and orange-trees, and the air was full of perfume. The sound of distant music reached his ears. “Whom will you see, sir?” said the servant, for neither Claude's face nor habiliments indicated one of the ordinary guests. “Your master, or Lord Elkington.” “They are in the boudoir of Madame la Comtesse.” “Lead on.” E 2 And the man went forward, opened the door, and announced him. He walked in. There was Count Carolan, General St. Hillaire, Elkington, and the young prince—they were all engaged in earnest conversation. At Claude's name there was a sudden pause, and his entrance was remarked with much attention. “Oh, sir,” said Elkington, “you come. You had better have sent a friend.” “Mr. Wyndham,” said Carolan, “you must be brief, for a trifling circumstance has occurred which renders it necessary for Lord Elkington to absent himself a while; and let me take the occasion to observe, in the most marked manner, sir, that, in remaining here when he might easily have gained the frontier—merely from a high and imperative sense of honour, and a generous determination not to escape from you—he has shown a character which places him far above your calumnies, and far above reproach. I presume, sir, you have come to demand satisfaction for the injuries inflicted on you last night. It would have been more comme il faut to send a third person.” “I come to demand my friend,” said Claude. “Your friend! Have you not selected one?” “I speak of Mr. Denham. I come to ask of his fate. He has a wife in a state of distraction—in suspense, and to relieve her I have undertaken this disagreeable visit. Is Mr. Denham dead?” “Mr. Denham is as he is,” said Carolan; “and permit me to remark, that if you were more au fait to the way of the world, you would not prefer such questions to persons not likely to answer.” “Mr. Wyndham,” said Elkington, “if you are not really a more despicable character than even I take you to be, you will not now decline the invitation which I tender you. Is it your intention to give me a meeting?” “No, sir. I regard you as a murderous ruffian, and beneath contempt.” “You are a dishonoured man!” said Elkington; “and words from your lips have hereafter no meaning.” “By those who honour you, my lord, I hope I shall be always despised. By frequenting your society, they sanction your deeds and degrade themselves to your level. If woman, knowing you, touches your hand, she falls from her purity; and if Providence sleeps not, your own character will prove to you a sufficient shame and a sufficient curse.” “You have received a blow!” said Elkington, pointing his finger at him. “I have,” said Claude; “and an insult thus given and thus endured, recoils upon him who inflicts, and ennobles him who receives. My character lies in the tenour of a stainless life, and cannot be permanently injured by a tongue uninspired by truth, or a hand unguided by honour. I appeal to Him who knows my motives for protection against you. He knows also that, if you are yet alive, you have to thank my fear, not of you, but of him.” There was a calmness in his manner which carried conviction to the very soul of St. Hillaire, and awed even Elkington himself. Carolan only said, “Ah, bah! fine notions—high ideas, sir—but, since you are not come here to redress your honour, the house is mine, and—” He waved his hand towards the door. “I forgive you, Carolan,” said Claude; “and may the time never come when you shall know, too much to your cost, the difference between an honest man— and such a person as you have made your friend.” “How great! how noble!” said St. Hillaire. “Let him say his worst. He is a blighted man, and the blow I publicly inflicted on him will never be forgotten. If, however, he dares again—” said Elkington. “Stop, young man,” said St. Hillaire, in a deep voice. “You cannot, you shall not again persecute this person. If he be destitute of the courage which leads men into danger, is it proper that you should therefore thus pursue him? And if he be, as I believe he is, gifted with all your bodily courage and ten times more—and if he be acting as he does, with the forbearance almost of God, solely from a principle of right, in what light do you then appear? You have raised the hand of a fiend against true grandeur and the sublimest courage which, even at the blow and hiss, does not stoop from its course. What have you then done? You have smitten as the Jew smote the Saviour. I do not approve your course. The blow you have struck will sink into your own forehead and your own soul deeper than into that of this unoffending being. My young friend, I do not envy you. I had rather be in his place than yours. You have no other course than to ask his pardon.” “His pardon, sir?” said Carolan, in a tone of astonishment. “I? an apology?” said Elkington. “Never.” “Go, then. You are rash, young, and ignorant of the true uses and meanings of life. That may be some excuse, but I believe you will suffer more than your victim from the occurrences of last evening. I believe, sir, in your cooler and better moments, they will haunt you as a curse, and that they will leave a stain upon your reputation as a gentleman.” “By G—d, sir,” said Elkington, “do you mean—” “I mean that you are in the wrong, young man,” said St. Hillaire, sternly; “and that, for one, I disdain you as an associate. I have watched your course in reference to this matter, and I despise you, sir.” “General St. Hillaire,” said Elkington, “do you know to whom—” “General,” said Carolan, “I protest—” “Gentlemen, I wish you good-morning,” said St. Hillaire.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER VIII. “Has he come home? Is he here? Have you seen him? Have you heard anything of him?” were the fearful questions from every lip as Claude returned to his hotel. “Madam Denham is nearly distracted,” said the landlord. “She calls for you. Pray go to her.” “I dare not,” said Claude, with a shudder. “She has demanded to be informed the instant you come in,” said the man. “She is in a state of intense excitement and agony. She walks the floor with frantic steps, as pale as a sheet. Sometimes she groans and weeps, sometimes she prays. She's in a terrible way. It's quite dreadful—and the poor little girl, too, is so distressed. My God! what sort of a man must her husband be, to leave her in such a condition?” A servant here came for Mr. Wyndham. He must go instantly to Madam Denham. It was with a faltering heart that Claude complied with this request, and once more approached the door where so lately he bade adieu to the friend who, perhaps, was now in eternity. As he did so, he heard the hasty steps of the bereaved widow—her deep groans—her bursting sobs. He entered. Her look made him shudder. “Speak!” cried she. “Charles—” “I know nothing,” said Claude. “Have you seen Lord Elkington?” Claude hesitated. “Is he living?” “He is.” “Oh, Mr. Wyndham, for the love of God, tell me all. You know, I am sure you do. I can bear it better than this suspense. Tell me—my husband is wounded—is perhaps—” she clasped her hands with quivering lips and sobbed convulsively—“dead!” “I do not know. I have heard nothing distinctly. He may be alive—” “Oh, God bless you for that word. He may yet live. But where is he? Why does he not return? Perhaps he is wounded. Perhaps he is this instant dying?” She pressed her hands against her brain. “Ah, cruel, cruel Charles! Is it you who have abandoned me thus? you, who have torn my heart—inflicted these horrid pangs? I will no longer wait. I will go seek him.” She rushed to the door. “My dear, dear sister,” said Ellen, “you cannot go. You do not know where he is. You are not dressed. If he were in the street, he would soon be here. If not, where would you go? Stay with me, my dear, dear sister. God will take care of us;” and the sweet child again folded her in her arms, and pressed her ashy cheek against her little bosom. “He might come, too, during your absence,” said the maid, respectfully. “Oh yes! true!” she said, with a frightful smile. Hours passed away as if they were ages. Noon— evening—night—and still Denham came not—and no news. Claude had again addressed himself to the police. They were abroad in search of the parties, but they could obtain no intelligence as to where they had gone, or what had become of them. Elkington was not at his lodgings—Lady Beverly had left town the day before for Hamburg, as if in anticipation of some difficulty. It was reported, too, that Elkington, early in the morning, had also gone, but whither no one knew. His escape had been connived at by so many gentlemen, who thought they were aiding a gallant fellow out of an unjust danger, that the police could get no trace of him. Indeed, from many considerations, they conducted the pursuit with no great activity. Although duelling was strictly prohibited in Prussia, and particularly by the great Frederic, whose clear mind had seen all its folly and wickedness, the crime was then—as we fear, alas, it is now—considered as one of those genteel misdemeanours of which a large class of educated, and many excellent men, are rather proud than ashamed. The magistrate who sternly sentences a poor, ignorant creature for having stolen wherewithal to support fainting life, cannot condemn the passionate fool who submits his disagreements with his friends to the chances of mortal combat, and who shows so little respect for himself—his adversary—society— and God, as to stake two lives on a throw, and thus sanction one crime by joining it with another. The police also felt that the parties were Englishmen— that securing a surviver in such a case would place them in an awkward dilemma. Lord Elkington's rank and fortune, moreover, threw a sort of exemption over his actions in the public opinion, and it was understood also that the injury had been words offensive to his honour as a gentleman. Poor Mrs. Denham. It seemed impossible that she could endure the interminable length of this day; but the very intensity of her apprehensions prevented her from sinking into the insensibility which nature would otherwise have provided for her relief. As the night approached, her agony had reached a state of nervous excitement, which rendered it necessary to call in a physician; but she would take nothing, and permit no remedies to be adopted, till she should receive direct intelligence of Mr. Denham. Nine o'clock struck—ten—eleven—twelve; still Denham came not, and no news of him could be obtained. It was now near one. The widow—for all felt that she was such except herself, and she still hoped—was almost deprived of her senses. At every whisper she started, at every step in the street she trembled. Sometimes the sound of horses' feet would advance from the distance. Her features would light up; the noise approached, and seemed about to stop at the door, but went on, and was lost again in the distance; now a shout in the street startled her—now an oath. Sometimes she heard the tramping of the soldiers' feet, as the guard were led round to their posts; and once a party of riotous young men went by, and, by a cruel coincidence, stopped immediately beneath the window, shouting forth a glee, which was interrupted by peals of laughter. Then they departed singing, their voices softening as they retreated, and dying at last utterly away; leaving, they little knew what —silence, solitude, and despair behind them. “Mr. Wyndham,” said Mrs. Denham, suddenly, in a voice of sternness, which made him think her senses were failing, “you are the cause of this!” “My dearest madam—” “You—coward!” “Great Heaven!” “You knew my husband had the heart of a lion. You knew he couldn't see his friend abused, and you —you meanly took a blow—a blow! a base, blasting blow! and yet you live—coward! and he, my brave, my noble, my lion-hearted Charles, for your infamy has risked his life—which, God in his mercy be praised, is but a risk. He will not perish. It is impossible. He will come. He is wounded, doubtless, but what do I care for wounds? He will come, or he will send for me. I shall nurse him. He will recover; but you, sir, must never look for his friendship again; nor his, nor mine, nor the world's esteem, nor your own. You are a dishonoured man. I had rather be Elkington than you. A blow! coward!” There was suddenly a knock at the door. Mrs. Denham fell back in her chair, laughing hysterically. The intruder was a messenger of the police, to know whether any news had been received of the affair. One o'clock. The heavy peal went floating and quivering over the silent town, and struck into the hearts of all present, for they now foreboded the worst. The solemn sound, as it died away, called forth new groans, sobs, and hysterical screams. All conversation ceased. There was as little room for remark as for hope or consolation. They sat like those unhappy beings we sometimes read of on a wreck, waiting in mute despair till the broken hulk goes down with them for ever. Two o'clock struck. Mrs. Denham had sunk into a state of exhaustion, when a sharp, heavy knock announced an end of this suspense. There was decision in it. The door was opened by a servant, and a step was heard in the hall, quick, light, buoyant. It approached, and all eyes were turned towards the door. “Ah God! he is here at last,” cried Mrs. Denham, with a smile of ineffable happiness, and gasping for breath. The new-comer entered. It was again a stranger. A start of horror went round the room, and a low shudder was heard from Mrs. Denham, who buried her face in her hands. “Mr. Wyndham?” said the stranger, who was a gentleman in dress and appearance. Claude stepped forward and recognised Beaufort. “I beg your pardon,” said that gentleman, with a polite smile; “will you permit me to have one word with you?” He cast a glance around upon the rest of the company, but without in the least changing his manner. He was a man of the world, and well knew what he was going to see when he undertook the mission. Claude followed him into an adjoining chamber. “Devilish painful duty, my dear fellow—disagreeable thing—in fact, d—d awkward—but—” “Speak out, and tell me what has happened,” said Claude, sternly; “I also have my duties.” “Sir!” said Beaufort, “your tone is very extraordinary, but your excitement excuses any liberty; I promised to let you know that your friend is hurt.” “Hurt! Oh, Beaufort! Oh, Heaven be praised! is he only hurt?” Vol. II.—F “Why, his wound is bad—d—d bad. He—he—in short, he's—dead, sir.” “Dead!” said Claude, with awe, with horror unutterable. “Denham! my friend!” “Yes, dead enough, sir. This is possibly rather annoying to you. I'm devilish sorry—I am, positively.” “Dead!” echoed Claude, the sound of his friend's living voice ringing in his ears; his beaming, laughing eyes flashing full before his imagination. “To say the truth, this morning at P—. He behaved very well—devilish well—I'm quite sure you'll be glad to hear that. The thing was perfectly well managed, I assure you. Perfectly. Nothing could be handsomer or fairer. Elkington missed him the first shot. Devilish odd, too—wasn't it? The second he hit him. He's a terrible dog. The ball went directly through the heart. He leaped six feet in the air, and he was a dead man before he came down. I protest I never saw anything so handsomely done.” “And I am to bear this news to his wife!” “Certainly! I've done my part. I stood by him to the last, and have brought the corpse in town. It will be here in—let me see, half past two—it'll certainly be three. By-the-way, madam is a fine-looking creature. Devilish pretty in that dress. Poor girl! I'm devilish sorry. You'll take good care of her, Wyndham? Egad, you're a lucky dog! Where are you going to have the body put?” “Did—did my friend leave me no message?” “Oh, apropos—what a forgetful dog I am! Certainly—a note for you.” “Give it me.” “Yes, devilish queer that I should forget that, as the poor man isn't likely to trouble me with another in a hurry. He put it in my hand the very last thing. He behaved immensely well, positively. I really thought at first that he was going to touch Elkington; his ball grazed his sleeve. Elkington smoked a segar through the whole affair. He's a capital fellow. Why—I've lost your letter—no—yes I have—no—ah, here it is.” “Who has the body?” “Two men. We hired 'em to bring it in town in the carriage. Egad! it's been all day in a windmill. We had to disperse, you see. Elkington's gone this morning at 12; I start to-night. I shall run over to Carlsbad. This cursed German cuisine plays the devil with one's stomach. Won't you smoke?” Claude did not answer. He was reading the note he had just received, which struck his nerves and soul with an agony of horror and grief, traced, as it was, by one now in the grave. “Well—adieu,” said Beaufort. “Leben sie wohl, mein freund! Au revoir!!” And the young man, lighting his segar and arranging the curls around his forehead, went out.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER IX. Trembling—thrilling—half blinded by horror and grief—Claude, after several vain attempts, read the letter. It was written in the writer's usual flowing hand. There was no tremour, or sign of haste, or agitation, except that two drops of wax from a candle showed that it had been the work of the night. “My dear Claude, “This will only be put into your hands in case of my death. You will, before then, be informed on the circumstances which produce it. I saw you struck last night, and I lost all prudence; I interfered, and received a blow myself. I have always been brought up to think a blow ought not to be borne. Death is preferable to dishonour. I know Elkington is a shot, but I can't help it. The custom of society must be complied with. Do not blame me, my wiser and more thoughtful friend. You have your opinion, I mine. I am determined to kill Elkington if I can, unless he make me the humblest apology. This is not to be expected, and I am prepared to fall. I need not say that I have not called on you to arrange the thing for me, as I know you would have taken measures to prevent it; otherwise there is no man on earth I should so readily have chosen. Beaufort I had a slight acquaintance with, and he consented at once. “I do not allow myself to think of the future; it would be useless, and might unman me. My uncle's fortune, you know, most unfortunately, reverts to other heirs at my death; but I have ensured my life for £2000, which will keep—I cannot write her name— out of want. You are in a fixed position in society, calm, wise, and good; and with leisure to make this blow as tolerable as possible. She is an angel, Claude. Never has she brought one frown to my face, one shadow to my heart. She is all beauty, compliance, sweetness, love—a being as rare as diamonds are. I do not write to her. I dare not. I cannot. I have tried, but there my firmness forsakes me. I love her to adoration, the extent of which even she cannot know. I have kissed the glove she has worn, the flower she has touched. I have often blessed her with all a lover's rapture—in her absence—in her beautiful sleep; and, were I to suffer my thoughts to dwell longer on her, I should let this Elkington go—I should defy all men's opinion. But a blow! Destiny calls me—I have no alternative left. “You will find in my portfolio, third drawer from the top, in the secretary of the little room I occupied as a reading-room, a paper of directions which I have prepared for you. The life ensurance company will pay, I presume, without hesitation. I am quite certain she can never want the firm and wise protection of a brother while you live. At this moment, my fancy recurs to what may happen to-morrow; to the pain it will inflict on her sweet—sweet bosom; to the scene which must follow any accident. I am almost ready to acknowledge that I am wrong in thus pursuing this act; that you are right—nobly—sublimely right in your higher, milder, and braver course. Yes, I do you justice—full—full justice. As my eye glances from this sheet—the last, perhaps, I shall ever write—to the face of my wife—who has trusted her happiness to me —now sealed with a calm and happy peace, which my infatuation is so soon to destroy—I feel like a scoundrel and a fool. Yet this custom of society must be complied with. Protect her, ye angels! Pity her, oh God! “Adieu, my friend—may we meet again!—and, once free from this affair, I here record my oath never to engage in another. Kiss Ellen for me, should the worst happen; and bear my blessing, my farewell to my wife. “Ever affectionately, my dear Claude, “Your friend, “Charles Denham. “P.S.—And our journey to Italy, too!” As Claude finished reading, there was a slight stir behind him. He turned—it was Mrs. Denham. Her pale face—her wild eyes—her long loose hair—the singular expression which terror and long agony had called into her countenance, now heightened by the certainty that Denham was no longer living, gave her the aspect of a spectre escaped at the dead hour of night from the abodes of eternal wo: she had read the letter over his shoulder, and she stood pointing at it with the grin of a lunatic. “Well, then,” she said, calmly, “I know all. Charles is dead. Charles! Charles!—my life!—my love!— my husband!—my own beloved Charles!” She wandered back again to her room. Claude could not conceive, indeed, how she had been thus sufferedto escape from it. He had not time to follow her before F 2 he heard the wheels of a carriage rolling away from the door, and he understood at once that the body had arrived, and that the attention of the rest had probably been attracted to that new and appalling scene in the tragedy. Shuddering with a horror which he had never experienced before, as well at the thought of the shock which the approaching scene was about to communicate to himself as to the appalled heart of the widow, he overtook her once more in the room, which was now deserted by everybody. Even Ellen was gone. “Where are they all?” said she, in a voice perfectly calm and natural. “Have they gone to bed already, without saying good-night? No. There they are! Where have they been? What is going on?” These queries were drawn forth by several figures which came in, with their backs towards the apartment. As they turned, their faces were all white and terror-stricken. Two or three men next appeared— waiters and strangers, among whom were some mere chance passengers, apparently attracted by curiosity from the street. A noise was heard in the corridor, as the uneven tread of men with heavy shoes bearing a burden, and a dead silence overspread all. Then the landlord entered and whispered Claude, who took Madam Denham's hand and led her into the adjoining room. She accompanied him passively. Ellen, pale and terrified, followed, but instantly darted back. The tramping grew nearer. The adjoining room seemed full of people. “Lock the door!” said a voice, in a low but business-like tone. “Shut this one.” There was a pause, interrupted only by the heavy tread of feet. “Take away the little girl!” said the same voice. “The other table—no—breadthways—now! steady! there! a sheet!” There was another pause. Claude held the hand of his companion with firmness, but, disengaging herself with a sudden start, she darted forward and threw open the door. There—in his usual clothes, boots, and spurs—his cravat off— his face stark, stiff, white—his long, glossy hair hanging back from his head—his arm fallen lifeless from the table—his marble forehead and lip touched with blood—lay the dear, the revered, the happy husband— his stately form extended in death. The wife saw it as she threw open the door. There was a quivering, broken shriek, but low and short. She darted forward. She pressed her hand against his brow—his lips—his heart. She touched his closed eyes—his icy cheeks—his stony forehead. Her fingers were chilled and stained with blood. “My husband!” she cried, with a convulsive sob. Then, without a word, a tear, a murmur more, she fell upon his bosom. The rude men stood apart. No one broke the silence. And thus came back the duellist to those whom Providence had appointed him to protect; to his wife —to his child—to his home; but yesterday full of happiness—of peace—of hope!</field>

      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER X. The day broke again, and all the noises of a busy city rose upon the air as usual. The birds were singing in the groves, the shining river lapsed slowly on in the sunshine, the careless passengers flowed in the same ceaseless tide through the streets, intent on their own affairs, of business or pleasure, of folly or vice. How few in the serious resolutions of virtue! Night fell with its coolness and silence—its dewy odours—its glittering stars—its silver clouds— its hidden scenes of mirth—of revel—of rash crime— of dark wo. During the day, the early dawn of which had brought to Mrs. Denham the dead body of her husband, and while it remained extended in bloody state upon the spot where, so few hours before, his gay voice had sounded, and he had held aloft the sparkling wine in the full security of life, health, and hope, the unhappy widow appeared able to restrain her feelings by their very intensity, as if none of the ordinary modes of grief could adequately give them vent. She even spoke with Claude calmly and rationally on the subject of her affairs; begged him to make several necessary arrangements preparatory to her departure; alluded to the anguish the news would cause her father, and inquired in what way “Charles” was to be buried. Since the first sight of him, when she had fainted on his cold and cruel bosom, she had not ventured to see the body, which had undergone the sad ceremonies preparatory to interment, and been duly clad in the last apalling toilet of the grave. It was considered necessary to commit it to the earth in the most private manner, and as soon as propriety would permit. Poor Claude! who had not slept for two nights—worn out, staggering, and exhausted—attended himself to these painful duties—answered for the expenses—ordered all the necessary articles, each one of which, even to name, strikes heavily on the heart, and calls upon us like a trumpet to remember the fleetingness, the nothingness of life. Mrs. Denham without him would have been alone, and it is frightful to think of the rude shocks her anguish-stricken mind would have been subjected to but for his firm, able, and watchful forethought and attention. She had no arrangements to make—no men to see—no bills to pay—no attempts at fraud to withstand. The door of her room leading to the body was locked, and she was seen by and she saw nobody. Her piety was fervent and sincere; and this solitude, which she employed in imploring support from her Creator, strengthened her soul and calmed her despair. Night came again—night—upon the widow. The cool, sweet shadows which he had loved so much—the bright, unweeping stars—and the round, soft moon, which he was never to see again. At her request, Mrs. Denham was left alone with the little Ellen, in whom this trying occasion showed a mind beyond her years. These two sweet beings were bound up in each other, and both, like two limpid rivers stealing to the sea, had poured all their affections upon him who had deserted them. The night seemed to open afresh the tenderness of their nature. Ellen stole into the lap of her sister, who folded and pressed her in her arms. “We are alone in the world now, Ellen.” “My dear sister,” was all that the affectionate and thoughtful child could utter. In a few moments Mrs. Denham asked for her portfolio. It was in a little room adjoining the bedroom, looking out on a garden. Denham had been writing there the day before. Ellen went to get it. Instead of returning, she remained, and Mrs. Denham heard a sob, and followed herself. On entering, her eyes were struck by the various objects of the room. There was his chair—the desk he had been writing on—his cane—and a pair of gloves, carelessly flung upon the table by himself, and wearing the impress of his hands. A book lay open, with a pearl paper-knife under it, and his pencil-case. A sheet of paper half filled with his writing. The ink seemed scarcely dry. He had left it at her call the day of Claude's last visit. It was a letter to her father. She read it. It was full of gay anticipations of their intended visit to Venice. His cloak and his travelling cap hung against the wall; and the bereaved wife heard—so illusive is imagination—the tones of his voice—now in light mirth—now in kind affection—or directing a servant—or reading a passage in poetry; then his laugh—then a tune hummed unconsciously, peacefully. She fell upon a sofa, and tears, as if her very soul were dissolving in torrents, gushed from her eyes, and her throbs threatened to suspend the functions of life. Claude had voluntarily slept in the room with the body. Locking the doors, wrapping his cloak around him, he threw himself upon a sofa at a late hour. Even exhausted as he was with mental and bodily fatigue, the proximity of the cold remains of the man he most loved, and the sobs of the unhappy widow, still, for a time, kept him from the sleep which nature demanded. For a few moments, as he lay—now the only protector and guide of that helpless woman, whose rash, unreflecting husband, had abandoned her to such horrors—he could not but feel that he had acted rightly; that, however gallant and chivalric might appear the course of Denham to the eye of vain pride and worldly reason, he had acted not only unwisely, but cruelly, and even wickedly. By submitting his quarrel to the chances of a meeting, he had made the pistol of a profligate duellist the arbiter of his own honour and his wife's happiness. He had ignominiously thrown away a life upon which rested heavy responsibilities, and thereby gratified Elkington's wish. What was the result of this fierce and desperate arbitrament? Had he resented the blow? Had he wiped out its stain? Had he punished the aggressor? No; the aggressor had struck him with the deliberate intention to provoke a combat, in which his skill made the result almost certain. In yielding, he had weakly run into the trap of a designing foe. That foe had triumphed. He was laid low in death. His fortune was forfeited; and even the policy of ensurance, upon which he had so strangely depended in the hurry and whirl of his last hour, he would have known, at any other time, could, under the present circumstances, be worth nothing; death in a duel being one of those acts which break the contract between the ensurer and the ensured. Mrs. Denham, then, was left penniless and helpless in a foreign country. Her bursting sobs betrayed her pangs. Where was the ear that should be first to hear, the hand nearest to sooth them? At length he dropped asleep in the midst of these reflections, and for all the distress he had suffered, he felt that secret support which attends the consciousness of having done right. Deeply agonized as he was at the thought that the very act of virtue which he congratulated himself upon had caused the death of his friend, his firm and unwavering sense of reason taught him that the consequences, however fatal, were the decree of Heaven. Amid the grief they occasioned him, there was no feeling of self-reproach. His sleep, though unbroken, was filled with dreams. Dark forms of bloody phantoms— the dim shadows of the waking world hovered around him. Again the lifeless form of his friend was borne in to blast the eyes of his distracted wife, who raved and shrieked in her despair. Little Ellen again moved about, pale and terrified; and the strange faces and heavy tread of common men came and went in the details of those arrangements, so cold to those who perform, so thrilling to those who behold them. Morning again dawned. Long before the gray light had paled the stars, Claude was up, and all things were ready to bear for ever away the sad remains of the loved one. The rude men came in again, their heavy steps echoing upon the uncarpeted floors and corridors. The coffin, that uncouth shape which differs so strangely from the same melancholy image in England and America, was about to be closed. The solemn, awful dead! Claude gazed long and deeply. The features were settled from the stern look which they had worn, into a peaceful smile and an unearthly beauty, such as often comes over the dead ere they are withdrawn for ever from the light of earth. “Alas!” he thought, as he perused those fixed and rigid features, “cold habitant of abodes we know not of! thou seest not! thou hearest not! Thou wast as I am. I must be as thou! Mayst thou carry with thee into the dark realm of eternity the peace thou hast taken from those who remain behind!” “Ready, sir?” said the undertaker, offering to lift on the lid. At this moment Ellen, her cheeks almost as white as those beside him, came to the door and beckoned Claude. He went to her. He stooped down and kissed her little quivering lips. She returned his embrace with a fond affection, as if she appreciated the kindness and wisdom of his character and conduct. Then she drew him by the hand along into the room of Mrs. Denham without saying anything. “Mr. Wyndham,” said Mrs. Denham, “one farewell look!” Claude had dreaded this, and he turned away his head. “I entreat—I implore! I am perfectly calm. Only one! I will be silent. I will be all myself. There is a power above. He will hold, He will sustain me. One parting look! do not fear for me—one—only!” “Come, then,” said Claude, feeling that the shock might perhaps be of service, by bringing her feelings to a crisis. Step by step—faltering — trembling—quivering in every fibre—the agitation of the moment thrilling them both, they passed slowly into the room. The homely menials stood away as they approached, and Claude regretted, long ere he reached the spot, the permission he had accorded. It was, however, too late. Mrs. Denham advanced. She uncovered the face. The faint gray beams of the early day fell coldly upon it. She gazed a moment. The silence was unbroken, when a shriek, piercing and wild—another—and another, announced how much she had overrated her own strength. The early labourer stopped in the street; the peasant woman rested her burden, stood and listened; and the windows of the surrounding houses were thrown suddenly open, while Claude bore a senseless form upon his arm from the room. The last star was yet visible in heaven as he returned from the neglected spot where the duellist was committed to the bosom of our common mother, hastening unbidden into the presence of his Creator, and leaving behind him broken hearts and broken fortunes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XI. Some days passed away. Time goes on, however it is with us. There are events which seem great enough to stop him, but he still goes on. He stays not for the lover. He whirls away all his light dreams, and he equally carries on the wretch to the end. After all, it does not so greatly matter how we fare in a vessel which crosses but such a narrow sea, and which no opposing wind can keep back a moment from its destined and dark harbour. Mrs. Denham recovered from the violence of her grief. She was pale, thin, and haggard; but she was again as others are, moving about, with her particular grief treasured in her own bosom. It seems strange how much we can endure, and yet eat, and drink, and sleep, and smile, and run the daily routine of familiar life. But the heart is made to endure. It is like a ship sent abroad upon the ocean, framed not only to glide over the smooth seas, but to cope with the billow and the whirlwind. There are in it corresponding principles of buoyancy. Behold it careering loftily, with swollen canvass and flying banner, moving like a god almost, over the beautiful, obedient deep. The tempest bursts upon it, and fearful is the struggle. It is worn, and torn, and broken. Its tall sails are rent, its gay banner is gone, and its spars strew the ocean; but, when the sunshine comes again, lo! it is there. Not the same, but it is there. To Claude this unhappy girl now owed everything. Vol. II.—G She was actually penniless. The money they had brought with them in cash was absorbed in the expenses of the funeral, mourning purchases, paying servants, of which they had two, a courier and a femme de chambre, whom Mrs. Denham was now obliged to pay. The courier was saucy, and demanded more than was just. He would have been paid but for Claude. The man was extremely insolent, and, seizing the valuable watch which Mr. Denham had worn, swore he would carry it off unless paid. Claude entered the room at the moment, sent to the police, had him arrested, and compelled him to make an humble apology and to beg for pardon, which, but at the request of her he had so brutally insulted, would not have been accorded. The letter of credit, usually carried by travellers, Mrs. Denham instantly enclosed to the bankers who had given it; knowing that the money she might draw on it would not now be refunded. “I am totally ruined,” said she to Claude. “I have positively nothing. Even were we at home, I should be in a state of destitution. My father has been unfortunate, and is not in a situation to offer us a home. Here I am worse; I am even in debt, and without the means of returning to England.” “No, madam,” said Claude. “You must excuse me for the liberty I have taken, but I have procured you another letter of credit upon my own account. I have ordered in all your bills. They are paid. This is the letter of credit. It is for one hundred pounds.” “Mr. Wyndham!” faltered Mrs. Denham, while little Ellen stole up to him, took his hand, and pressed it against her lips. “I am your husband's friend,” said Claude. “He has, however rashly and unnecessarily, sacrificed his life in my cause, and he has bequeathed you to my care. I will hear of no denial. Indeed, it is already done. You had better return to London at once. I know a lady—the kindest, the best in the world—who is going almost immediately; she will be a mother, a sister, a friend to you. It is Madame Wharton, of whom I have so often spoken.” “But this money—I am entirely without resources —I can never repay it. Propriety—delicacy—honesty, all demand that I should decline it.” “It is very well to talk in this way,” said Claude, “but I must tell you plainly, if you were ever so disposed to resist, you cannot. I must exert the authority with which I am invested; and, if you will not permit me to be your brother, I am, in my own right, your guardian.” “Dearest Mr. Wyndham,” said Ellen, coming to him as he sat, and putting her arm round his neck, “how good, how kind you are! God will bless you for your generosity to us. If she will not take the money, give it to me. I know you are sincere, and that you will be glad to help us out of Berlin. Oh, if uncle Charles had acted like you. What harm did Mr. Elkington do him, after all, by striking him? You were struck, and you are as well as you were before, and as good; and if he had killed you too, we should have had no friend. I'll take the money, and carry sister Mary back to London, and we shall bless you and pray for you, night and day, as long as we live.” “Sweet child!” said Claude, folding to his bosom the ingenuous little being, whose mind saw truth unclouded by sophistry or worldly example; “and, since I am to transact business hereafter with you, not with your disobedient sister, I shall tell you what else I have done. We need not care whether she likes it or not.” “No, indeed.” “I have directed £100 to be annually held by my banker, payable to your sister's order. See, she's going to contradict us; but we must teach her obedience to her new masters.” Mrs. Denham buried her face in her handkerchief. At nine o'clock the next evening, Claude conducted Mrs. Denham and her young companion to the office of the poste, where he presented them to Madame Wharton. He had taken the coupé, and they were comfortably arranged alone. The merry horn sounded again, and the clattering horses' hoofs struck fire from the pavement as they stood stamping in the court. Madame Wharton and Claude were already so knit in the bonds of friendship that he seemed to have known her all his life. Their parting was in a corresponding degree warm and affectionate. She folded him to her bosom, and, somewhat to his astonishment, imprinted a kiss upon his forehead. He was going to make some lively comment upon the rapid progress of their friendship, when he perceived her cheeks bathed in tears. As he bade farewell to Mrs. Denham, the poor girl's convulsive movements betrayed how her soul was shaken; but she took the handkerchief from her face one moment, and her eyes met his. “Mr. Wyndham,” she said, extending her hand, “I cannot reply—I cannot—but God will bless your future steps. There is one thing I must say before we leave, if my heart breaks with it; in my delirium the other day, I wronged you by charging upon you the catastrophe—the fatal—the—” She paused a moment, unable to proceed. “I wronged you,” she at length continued; “and every step I have heard of yours—every tone of your voice since—and every act of kindness and generosity, reproaches my folly and guilt in having done so.” Claude was deeply moved by this address, though it fell upon his burning soul like a balm. “You have acted right—wisely—nobly. Charles has—” The new agony of grief impeded her utterance. “Allons, messieurs, en route,” cried the conducteur, cracking his whip. “Mr. Wyndham — dearest Mr. Wyndham,” said Ellen, putting up her lips, her eyes streaming with tears, “good-by. Oh, I wish we could live with you always.” “And remember, dearest child,” Claude whispered in her ear before he lifted her into the carriage, “in me you have a friend. Write to me sometimes. My address is at my banker's; and I promise, whatever you ask, I will always comply, as if I were your father.” The portières were closed with a slam. The voyageurs in the voiture were ready. Adieus full of mirth and joy were exchanged between parting friends. The cumbrous vehicle dashed off into the street; a handkerchief was waved to him out of the window as it was lost in the shadow, he could not distinguish by whom; and tears, sad but sweet, relieved his aching heart, and enabled him to breathe more freely, now that the curtain had fallen over the closing scene of the tragedy in which he had borne such a painful rôle. As he walked home through the crowded streets, the cool air fell soothingly upon his face, as if the breath of angels were mingled with it. He paced on through the narrow König Strasse—crossed the bridge, where the colossal equestrian statue of the great elector frowned upon him through the shadows—and beheld the vast Schloss rising against the summer heaven, as it had stood for centuries, and beneath whose roof he had spent so many happy hours amid those royal gayeties which fascinated him so much on his first arrival. He had calm but high thoughts of life, and, man as he was, wended his lonely way homeward. He walked the earth as one willing to quit it, and certain of a brighter abode. “Strange life!” he thought; “yet why should he mourn who has done no wrong? Already the events which have so harrowed me are swept into the past; already they have become shadows. The frowns and the cold looks of that gay society, who have condemned me unheard for following the dictates of reason, humanity, and religion—the blow of Elkington—the G 2 thoughts of the rash—the sneers of the unfeeling—the dead face of Denham—the bursting sobs of the newmade widow — the horror and anguish of my own soul, swerving from its path at the shocks of fortune— already they have ceased to be realities. They are memories—they are vanished dreams. Is it for these that I would sacrifice right, which is eternal?” It was ten when he reached his hotel. The responsibility which had rested on him was now at an end. He felt exhausted, and tired nature asked repose. The thoughts which had preyed upon him ceased their task, and a tender languor overspread his soul. The world was against him. He had disregarded its rules—its vile customs—its antique, bloody opinions. He had received a blow! It had not stained him. It had left him free to act, as the pale moon is free to keep on her Heaven-appointed course, even when the dog howls at her, and the maniac treads on her uninjured light, and swears she is unchaste. Was he to blame, that Denham, knowing his opinions, had sought his fate? Well he knew (and the thought gave him perfect quiet on that point), had he been able to prevent his meeting his enemy by sacrificing his own life, he would have done so without a moment's hesitation. He had done all in his power, and the dark consequences were shaped by Heaven's inscrutable decree, which the blind mortal must bow to without seeking a cause. It is the privilege of principle to be able to turn to Providence, whatever may grow out of its conscientious action, without fear. It can murmur to its Creator, “It is not I, oh God! but thou.” As he threw himself upon the bed, a voice beneath the window—some wandering lover, perhaps, serenading his mistress—broke forth into the following song by Curran. The voice of the singer was clear, melodious, and gave to the music, of no common sweetness, the charm of taste and feeling. “Oh sleep! a while thy power suspending,' Weigh not yet my eyelids down; For memory see! with eve attending, Claims a moment for her own. I know her by her robe of mourning, I know her by her faded light; When, faithful with the gloom returning, She comes to bid—a sad `good-night.' “Oh let me hear, with bosom swelling, While she sighs o'er time that's past; Oh let me weep, while she is telling, Of joys that pine, and pangs that last. And now, oh sleep, while grief is streaming, Let thy balm sweet peace restore, While fearful hope through tears is beaming, Sooth to rest that wakes no more!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XII. Claude now made the necessary preparations to leave Berlin. He had laid before the police an account of the manner in which he had been twice attacked; but, having no information to give, they could do nothing for him but offer him a passport with as little delay as possible. He was resolved, however, not to leave till he had in some degree counteracted the calumnies of Elkington. He had written to the Marquis of E—, who, with Lord Perceval, was perfectly acquainted with his curious history, and perhaps knew more of it than he felt at liberty to disclose. The reply was a letter so decisive and flattering, that he almost hesitated to submit it to any one's inspection. He, however, concluded to send it to Carolan; and, fearful of having it returned, like the last, unopened, he determined to enclose it to General St. Hillaire, who had so nobly, and with such dignity, defended him against the last insolence of Elkington. He accordingly wrote him the following note: “My dear General, “I am about leaving Berlin, but cannot do so without performing a certain duty to myself, the necessity of which imboldens me to address this request to you. It is also proper that your generous confidence in me should be confirmed; and I beg therefore to enclose to you the accompanying letter from the Marquis of E—; a gentleman, I believe, whom Count Carolan corresponds with, and whose opinions may have some weight. I have a kind of right to press this letter on Count Carolan, who has openly exhibited an acquiescence in the misstatements of Elkington. I leave to his own sense of right the task of protecting my name hereafter. As to my courage—a suspicion of it can only be removed by those occasions which Providence sends, enough to try the temper of our souls on earth, and to furnish us an opportunity to display it to the world when vanity requires. If circumstances have raised a doubt of mine, it is a misfortune which, like shipwreck or pestilence, every man is liable to, and which, if chance does not remedy it, patience must endure. Having deliberately adopted a principle upon this point, I shall adhere to it and abide the consequences. From all other doubts the letter of the Marquis of E— rescues me; and, after perusing it, Count Carolan will at least do me the justice to express himself satisfied, and to acknowledge that my past life has been as irreproachable as it has been unfortunate. “For yourself, my dearest general, accept my thanks for the manner in which you have interested yourself in my favour. That there are many persons above the prejudices of the day, and who can find other motives for the course I have chosen than vulgar fear, I am convinced; but as the first who boldly took part with the poor and the insulted, and whose superior wisdom comprehended his actions, you will never be forgotten by your sincere and grateful friend, “Claude Wyndham.” Claude to Count Carolan. “Sir, “I send you, through General St. Hillaire, a letter from the Marquis of E—furnishing a brief history of my past life, from his knowledge of my character and conduct. The apparent indelicacy of presenting an eulogium so partial, as well as my repugnance to open any farther communication with one whose good opinion has been withdrawn with a publicity so unjust, would secure you against further intrusion of me or my affairs; but a name which, however unadorned with rank or affluence, I have endeavoured to keep at least unstained — gives me the right to deny with proof whatever has been asserted with falsehood and believed with haste. I bestow no attention on Elkington, because he is wilfully wrong; and I offer this explanation to you, because I think you only carelessly so. That you are wrong your perusal of the letter enclosed will compel you to allow, and my slandered character induces me to demand the acknowledgment. “I have the honour to be, your obedient servant, “C. Wyndham.” An hour afterward, the Marquis of E—'s letter and his own were returned unopened to Claude in one from Carolan, containing the following lines: “Mr. Wyndham: Sir, “I enclose the letter of the Marquis of E—, as well as your own, without any other reply to the `demand' you make for an acknowledgment of `error' than that men's opinions are their own, and differ in many points more doubtful and important. There is an account at my banker's of £50, which I will thank you to settle. “Your obedient servant, “Carolan.” Claude tore the letter into pieces and dropped it on the floor. Its injustice and insolence he felt for a moment bitterly; but he thought him an ass, and then dismissed the subject from his mind, he trusted, for ever. He had scarcely done so when the footman brought in two more letters. One was in his banker's hand, which he welcomed with pleasure. He had not only long since used all his ready cash, but he had considerably anticipated his income. His late payments for Mrs. Denham had caused him to do this; and as for the £50 for which, in a casual transaction with Carolan respecting a horse, he had become indebted to him, and which that gentleman so singularly demanded, he had really, until now, forgotten to repay it. Nor did he find, in the pertinacity with which it was demanded, anything more than the desire of a little mind to avail itself of the most trifling opportunity of offering an insult. Since his payments for Mrs. Denham, in fact, he had not the means to refund it till the receipt of the usual remittance from his London banker, which he had some time before written for, and which he now every day expected. He opened the present letter, therefore, with a feeling of pleasure, as affording the means to settle his accounts and quit Berlin immediately. It was not without reading it over two or three times that he was able to comprehend its full import. It was as follows: “London, —. “Sir, “We beg to inform you, for your government, that the sum hitherto deposited in our hands on your account has been withheld for the ensuing year, and we are instructed that it will not hereafter be continued. “We are also grieved to inform you, that, upon the presentation of your last draught, we were under the unpleasant necessity of declining to accept it, on account of the irregularity attending your having drawn it considerably in advance of your income. “We annex a statement of your account, wherein you will perceive that your draughts amount to when, as your income up to the 1st of June £563 amounts to 525 leaves at your debit £38 of which we request you will take due note, in order to reimburse immediately the balance, which we are instructed to desire with the least possible delay. “We remain, sir, “Your very obedient servants, “N. B. &amp; Co.”</field>

B. &amp; Co.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XIII. It often happens that a misfortune falls upon us precisely at the time when we are least able to bear it. This was now the case with Claude. He had not overdrawn his salary at any former time, nor had he ever been in debt. But Rossi had been a considerable tax upon him. The £100 to Mrs. Denham had taken all his means. He was naturally careless of money, and he now found, with alarm and horror, that his expenses amounted to considerably more than he had the power to pay. He would be unable even to discharge his hotel bill. He owed about £30 besides the £38 to the London banker, and a small protested draught. The note of Carolan now startled him. It now wore a different aspect, but it was still as full of mystery as of perplexity. It was a demand of payment of the £50, couched in terms intentionally insulting, and implying a suspicion that it might not be liquidated. With all his fancied self-discipline, his blood boiled at the idea of an insult; but one thus deliberately preferred by a man to whom he owed money he could not pay, had a character of its own not at all agreeable. He had promised Carolan at their last interview to settle it at once. He had thus far neglected doing so, in consequence of the whirl of affairs in which he had been involved. Perhaps of all the evils which can befall a man, poverty, if not the very worst, is, as society is constructed, the most difficult to endure with cheerfulness, and the most full of bitter humiliations and pains. Sickness has its periods of convalescence, and even guilt of repentance and reformation. For the loss of friends time affords relief, and religion and philosophy open consolation. But poverty is unremitting misery, perplexity, restlessness, and shame. It is the vulture of Prometheus. It is the rock of Sisyphus. It throws over the universal world an aspect which only the poor can see and know. The woes of life become more terrible, because they fall unalleviated upon the heart; and its pleasures sicken even more than its woes as they are beheld by those who cannot enjoy them. The poor man in society is almost a felon. The cold openly sneer, and the arrogant insult with impunity. The very earth joins his enemies, and spreads verdant glades and tempting woods where his foot may never tread. The very sky, with a human malice, when his fellow-beings have turned him beneath its dome, bites him with bitter winds and drenches him with pitiless tempests. He almost ceases to be a man, and yet he is lower than the brute; for they are clothed and fed, and have their dens; but the penniless wanderer, turned with suspicion from the gate of the noble or the thatched roof of the poor, is helplessly adrift amid more dangers and pains than befall any other creature. In an instant—from his easy station—when, self-dependent, he could smile at Elkington, and turn his back upon Carolan and the world—the proud and haughty Wyndham was reduced to utter and hopeless destitution. He was literally beggared. He was worse than beggared. He was in debt, and he saw no means of extricating himself. One of his debts, too, was to a man who hated and despised him, and who had shown himself capable of insulting the more openly as he found his victim the more defenceless. This was a position which startled him with peculiar horror. What was he to do? How was he to pay the liabilities he had contracted? How was he to leave Berlin? Where was he to go? In what way was he hereafter to maintain himself? These questions pressed themselves upon his mind with a fierce importunity, resembling nothing which he had ever before experienced, and producing the strangest effect upon his thoughts and feelings. “Well,” said he, pacing his room to and fro slowly, “I am then a beggar. I am a debtor. From what cruel hand can this new blow proceed? What can it mean? Can I live? How? With what hope of happiness or honour? Life to me was already deprived of nearly every charm! What will it now become? Had I not better have fallen beneath the aim of Elkington? Had I not better, as a Roman would, leave voluntarily the earth, where I seem to have no more a right to dwell?” But these thoughts soon gave way to others calmer and more sensible. “I am in the hands of Him who can lift up and put down at pleasure. Were suicide even right in itself, it would not be so in me. I am a debtor. I would rest in my grave without wronging any one of a shilling. I am young, strong, and healthy. I will not be idle. I will seek some occupation, I do not care how toilsome or mean. The world? I have already shown that, while I respect its honest opinions, I despise its prejudices. Its scorn and hisses are nothing to me when I do not deserve them. I will descend into a lower class of life, as the taunting Carolan advised me. I will labour, if it is at the plough. I will do anything rather than live dependant, idle, or in debt.” Nervous and agitated by this formidable prospect, he continued walking to and fro, endeavouring to calm Vol. II.—H the tumult of his mind, and decide instantly upon some future line of conduct. Many were the singular ideas which occurred to him. He was now unable to escape from the assassin who pursued him so mysteriously. Mrs. Denham would find the annuity he had settled upon her stopped. He must write to her immediately. What would Carolan say when he found he had broken his promise to deposite the money? What would the banker say on receiving news of his protested bill? What would the few who still defended him in the society where he had once been so flatteringly received — what would they think and say upon finding Elkington's prophecies true? That he was an adventurer without means? Madame Wharton, General St. Hillaire, Monsieur and Madame de N—, and half a dozen others, who had always remained kind towards him, and who even generously and confidingly offered their intimacy with him—would not even they now fall off? Would not the pompous and conceited Carolan, whose mind and heart seemed filled with egotism, to the exclusion of sense and feeling, now have facts of his own to state against him? Had he not broken his word? Had he not borrowed money which he was unable to pay? Sharp was the pang with which he revolved these thoughts; another day passed away, we will not describe how painfully. The next morning he determined to go forth into the air, hoping that a walk, his favourite resource in moments of agitation, would cool the fever of his blood, and suggest some more favourable view of his prospects. He had taken his hat and was about leaving the room, when a man entered. He was a chasseur of Count Carolan's. He had known him previously, and had remarked in him a watchful attention to his wishes, and a profound respect almost ludicrous. There was now a change in his manner. He came in without knocking, slammed the door after him, and neither took off his hat nor raised his hand as was his custom. “Monsieur le Comte sends this letter, and begs an answer.” Claude looked at him with astonishment, then broke the seal. As he did so, the man walked around the room, examined the pictures upon the walls, and half hummed a tune. The letter ran thus: “Count Carolan begs that Mr. Wyndham will give the bearer the £50, or that he will name an hour during the day that he will deposite the sum at his banker's. He will please to communicate with the bearer.” “Do you know the contents of this letter?” demanded Claude. “Oui, monsieur.” “Tell your master I will see the banker upon the subject in the course of the morning.” “Non, monsieur. It must be done at once. Monsieur le Comte requested me not to leave you without either the money, or your distinct promise to pay it at a fixed hour to-day. Monsieur le Comte has sent to the police also to stop your passport.” “My passport! The police!” “Oui, monsieur,” said the man, with a smile; at the same time arranging his cravat and collar somewhat affectedly. There is something in petty insolence more difficult to endure than in insults more pronounced. Claude felt all his self-government necessary to restrain him from thrusting the fellow down stairs. “I will see the banker at two this morning,” said Claude; “or, if your master wishes, I will see himself.” “Non, monsieur; Monsieur le Comte does not wish to see you. He wishes you to transact business with me.” “With you?” “Oui, monsieur;” and he sat down upon the sofa; “and I wish you to make haste, if you please, for I too am a little pressed. Monsieur might as well give the money, or worse may come of it.” “When your master sends a messenger whom a gentleman can receive or a gentleman would send,” said Claude, “I will return an answer.” “Oh, very well, monsieur,” said the man. “You mean to be impertinent, I see. I shall wait, however, till Monsieur le Comte sends another messenger, which he will probably do presently.” And he very coolly raised his legs upon the sofa, and, reaching a book, opened it with the air of a young lord looking into the last new novel. It is said that there is an end to all things. However that may be respecting other matters, there was certainly an end to Claude's patience. He grasped, very leisurely, the fellow by the throat, and lifted him unceremoniously to the door. “You shall give me the satisfaction of a gentleman, you shall—or I'll post you,” said the man. The next moment he was thrust down stairs at some peril to his neck. “Well,” said Claude, heated and indignant, “I commence my new condition well. Is it possible that Carolan can have already heard the change in my fortune? Who could tell him? What mystery surrounds me? What devils are sporting with my destiny?” He once more took his hat, but he was again interrupted by the waiter of the hotel. “Ah! by-the-way,” said Claude, “I forgot I had rung; but did you see that fellow whom I put out of my room just now?” “Yes,” said the man, bluntly. “Well, never let him enter my door again.” “He's got as much right here as others,” said the man, quietly; “perhaps more.” “What do you mean, you scoundrel?” said Claude. “Civil words, mein herr,” said the man. “There's your bill!” “My bill! I did not order it.” “No, I suppose not.” The truth crossed his mind. “Well, put it on the table. I'll look over it.” The man went out and left the door open. “Come back,” said Claude, “and shut the door after you.” The fellow turned his face, whistled, and went on his way without paying him the slightest attention. “Ah! I forgot,” thought Claude. “I am poor. It is already known.” And, with a heavy heart, he made a third attempt to walk, which was luckily successful, though, as he went out, the landlord and waiter eyed him a with suspicion which almost indicated an intention to stop him. Sad were his thoughts as he sought once again his favourite retreats in the Thiergarten; and it was characteristic of him, that the disappointment to which his adversity would subject Rossi, and particularly Mrs. Denham and Ellen, gave him much pain, even amid his gloomy views of his own future affairs. Embarrassment, humiliation, and actual want stared him in the face. It was deep noon as he found himself in the centre of the wood. The Park at this hour, in the middle of a summer day, appears like the cool abodes of the blessed. It is almost entirely deserted by human intruders. The labourers are at their toil; the fashion-hunters are generally abroad elsewhere at the various watering-places in search of pleasure, and those in town postpone their drive till the sultry heat has given way to the cool afternoon shadows. Scarcely any one is seen, except some student with his book, his long hair, unshorn beard, open collar, and velvet coat, giving to him the appearance of an Italian of the middle ages; or perhaps a bronzed peasant-woman dropping beneath a heavy burden, or an officer riding along the deeply-shaded avenues, his bright uniform, nodding feather, and horse glancing through the trees. The breath of this charming wood was cool and fragrant, as its moist paths and fanciful bridges are profusely H 2 fringed with flowers. The little islands lay in the motionless water fresh and green. The birds called to each other through the silent glades. The beak of the woodpecker made the forest resound, and the squirrels leaped, paused, and listened in the road; and the swans, those most beautiful objects in creation, when throned on the water, gave to the landscape the air of some enchanted island, which might have intreasured the perennial bowers of Calypso and her nymphs; “and never,” thought Claude, “did the son of Ulysses meet danger more formidable, and the dear guide of his steps far away.” Beautiful did this calm, bright world look to Claude on that morning; but the topics which pressed immediately upon him left him little leisure for his ordinary and almost voluptuous enjoyment of nature. Something must be done at once; action—instant action was demanded. He could not, without a kind of dishonesty, sleep that night in the hotel. Where was he to sleep? He had no friend to whom he could disclose his new calamity; and if he had, taken in conjunction with all that had happened, could they believe him? How was he to pay his debts? How was he to procure food for the sustenance of life? He had a valuable wardrobe; watch, rings, diamond pin; a horse, saddle, bridle. He thought these might bring enough to pay Carolan, the banker in London, and his bills in Berlin. He determined, without hesitation, to sell everything—to the very coat he had on, rather than wrong any one. He resolved to dress himself at once in clothes befitting his new state. He resolved to listen to no false pride or shame. Honour, he felt, was in itself, not in “the trappings and the suits” in which men too often look for it. As to occupation, there was but one. His own taste had rendered him a proficient in languages. He made a wry face at it, but, before he had walked an hour he had come to the resolution to offer himself that day as a teacher of English. The smile—the sneer—the scornful whisper of those who had predicted his downfall, when they should witness it, rose before him. But his mind was really brave, and the habit of looking to itself—and to its Maker for right, enabled him to bear up against these painful anticipations. As for the blow which he had at first thought could never leave his mind—already, in the wholesome exercise of action, in the preparations to meet the real exigences and sober duties of life, he had forgotten it. Even Ida, now that occupation had displaced idle reveries, he regarded with cooler judgment. His love for her was far from being abated. It was even increased by what had happened. But it was divested of hope. It had assumed the character of an enchanting dream—to sooth sometimes hereafter his solitary moments—to compensate him for the homely cares of life—to be gazed at, as the mariner watches the polar star, who, without thinking to reach it, makes it the guide of his steps. While pursuing these thoughts he had penetrated into the most solitary and unfrequented recesses, where indeed there was no regular footpath, but only green lanes winding through thick shrubbery, and lofty trees for the accommodation of single horsemen. He had reached the end of his walk and was preparing to return, when his foot struck against something heavy, which he would have taken to be a stone but for a peculiar sound. He passed on for several moments, but retraced his steps. He had even some difficulty in discovering the spot. It was moist earth, and the long grass and thick surrounding shrubbery showed that it was rarely trodden by the foot of man. After feeling about for some time with his foot, he struck the object again. It was half buried in the ground. He picked it up. It was a stout leathern purse, quite full. He opened it. The contents were Louis. He sat down and counted them. There were two hundred and fifty. He emerged from the shadowy recess and looked around. Not a person was to be seen. He gazed upward. The branches hung motionless and solitary. Though he half expected to behold some human face gazing on him, the wood was as hushed as at midnight, except occasionally the woodpecker tapped the hollow trunk of the beech; or an acorn fell, dropping through the leaves; or a squirrel stood erect, listening and starting, close to his side, as if watching against every intruder; or the crow, which slowly floated over him close to the tree-tops, uttered his hoarse cry. He looked at the purse again. It was wet, mildewed, and nearly decayed. The clasp was covered with mould. It had possibly been months—perhaps years where he had found it. He advanced towards home. A ragged man met him. His features were bloated with intemperance. His face was haggard, and yet vicious in its expression, and he was almost destitute of clothing. “A penning!” said he, holding out his hand. Claude gave him a groschen. He looked at it, surprised at receiving so much more than he had asked for, and went away looking back once or twice. He little knew how near he had been to wealth. Claude thought of the blessing which that money would be to him and to himself, but he thought of it without wavering. He knew the course of right was fixed, and was not only the noblest, but the most advantageous to pursue. “Elkington has accused me of dishonourable intentions,” he thought. “I could have shot him for the slander. But what would that prove? Here Heaven sends me an occasion to confute the charge by my conduct!” And, had he been about to expend the money in pleasure, he could not have felt more impatience than he experienced to return the new-found treasure to its owner.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XIV. On re-entering the town, Claude cast his eyes upon the walls, trees, and fences where public bills were usually posted, and which he never thought of regarding before. There were the advertisements of concerts in the gardens—of fireworks—menageries—theatres—auctions, etc., etc. At length one larger than the rest, conspicuously headed “100 thalers reward,” met his eye. On examining it, he read as follows: “Lost, on the 1st of January, in or about the town, a leathern purse containing 250 Louis. The finder will receive the above reward on presenting the purse at the comtoir of Monsieur Kühl, No. 433 Kloster Strasse.” The bill was blackened, weather-worn, and nearly effaced. A part of it had been torn off by some idle hand, and a staring new advertisement of a “Grosses Concert” was pasted nearly over it, as a thing passed and forgotten. Claude instantly bent his way towards the counting-house of Monsieur Kühl. On arriving at the house, he entered the comtoir, and found himself, after passing an antechamber, in a large apartment filled with clerks behind high desks and counters; he inquired for Mr. Kühl, and was asked for his card, which the young man, after reading, not without marks of interest, carried into his chef. The young man presently returned, and desired him to walk into a private room. Mr. Kühl was writing. He was one of the richest bankers in Berlin—a large, plain-looking person, not dressed with much neatness. One could scarcely have conceived, from his appearance, that he was worth millions. He looked up and rose, and himself handed a chair. “I have the honour of speaking to Mr. Claude Wyndham, the gentleman lately connected with the dreadful affair which has happened in our town, and created such a sensation.” Claude acquiesced. “I am very happy to see you, Mr. Wyndham. Do not blush, young man,” said Mr. Kühl, for Claude coloured at the allusion. “I am the father of three sons, as hot after gunpowder as if it were good wine; and I have learned, with great admiration, your whole conduct in this affair. Don't blush, sir, to have set your face against duelling. You have acted nobly. Every father — every mother—every wife and child in the universe ought to bless and support you. Such an example is worthy a hero. Sir Walter Raleigh did the same; and I think I have heard that Washington, the great American soldier and statesman, did the same. Sir, in the name of my family—in the name of mankind, I thank you.” And the honest man, who had risen in his enthusiasm, seized his hand and shook it heartily. “Sir,” said Claude, “I have acted according to my conscience; and your approbation, as a stranger, is grateful to me.” “Conscience, sir? I'm glad to find a man of your appearance, and moving in your exalted rank of life, has one. The young folks of the day generally are without it. Egad, their corsets are laced so tight that there isn't room for it.” And he laughed loudly at his humour. “I shall always be too proud if Mr. Wyndham will honour me by a visit; my wife and daughters want to see you. You are prayed for in our family. You have saved bloodshed.” “I? Indeed, sir!” “My son has met you somewhere, and, it seems, has a great esteem for you. I don't wonder, sir; egad! now I look at you, I don't wonder. Well, sir, this young whipper-snapper—he's only nineteen—must get into a quarrel with another blockhead. My boy was struck — swords were chosen — the ground was selected—and the young fools would have cut each other's ears and noses off as sure as fate, if Madame Wharton had not happened to come in. I'm her banker, sir. She visits our family—God bless her! and a noble creature she is. She gave us your history, sir. My son heard how you had borne a blow—passing it over with the contempt it merited rather than commit a crime. It made a deep impression on him—for the boy has a soul. He went to his adversary, and told him he had come to exchange apologies. They did so, and are now the best friends possible. One bold example goes far, particularly with the young. Let a few more men like you thus discountenance duelling, and it will fall into the hands of vulgar black-guards and cutthroats, where alone it deserves to be sanctioned. Sir, I honour you; and if ever I can serve you in any way, command me to any extent. My house —my purse are at your service.” “I have not come to take purses to-day, but to give them,” said Claude, whom this narration had restored to a part of his natural ease and gayety of manner. “You are named as the person to receive a large sum of gold lost in January.” “Well, sir!” “Here it is.” “Why, where on earth did you light upon it?” “I found it this morning in the Park.” “By Heaven! you know not what you've done.” He seized his hat. “You shall take a walk with me. It is not far. I will show you something which will repay your trouble.” Claude began to think the old gentleman was crazy, from the rapidity with which he went puffing and blowing along through the streets, muttering half-uttered exclamations of impatience and joy. “Here we are,” said Monsieur Kühl. They stopped before a little, low, poor-looking house in Frederic Strasse. Monsieur Kühl hurried up to the fifth story and knocked. The door was opened by a little old lady, neatly dressed, but with a pale countenance. Nothing could be more scanty than the furniture of the room. Upon a mean bed, lay the form of another female—an invalid—and a little poorly-clothed child sat on the floor, eating a piece of dry, black bread. “Come in! come up! ha! ha! ha! Mon Dieu! I've brought a visiter. Come up, monsieur.” The little old lady courtesied with an air of good breeding, which strangely contrasted with the poverty-stricken appearance of the things around her. “Pray be seated,” said she, handing the two broken chairs. “I want you to relate to this monsieur your history,” said Mr. Kühl. “Be brief, for he's a hard-hearted dog, and won't bear any amplifications.” The old lady looked rather surprised. “I really don't know,” said she, in French, “why I should trouble monsieur with miseries which he—” “Nach! obey me,” said Monsieur Kühl. “Tell it. I am sure it will amuse him. He's extremely fond of tragedy.” “I do not know what you mean,” said the old lady; “but I know you are my only friend, Mr. Kühl, and I shall comply.” “And in the very fewest words possible,” added Kühl. “Well, then, we are two poor sisters. Our parents were rich, but lost all their fortune, and then their lives. We had one sister. She was governess in the family of a Russian nobleman. For twenty years we scarcely heard anything of her, till one day the news arrived of her death. She had amassed, sir, a considerable sum, about 250 louis-d'ors. We were old and destitute, and she had consigned this money on her dying bed to a servant of her patron, who had permission to travel. He brought it to Berlin, and here he lost it—so at least he says. His master had reason to believe that he had gambled it away, and he is at this instant in Siberia. This has been the last we ever heard of our little property; my poor surviving sister is an invalid, and we are struggling along with as much resignation as possible.” “There is your money!” said Kühl. “Hand it out, Mr. Wyndham.” And it was with a sincere feeling of satisfaction that Claude laid the purse upon the table. “Count them,” said Mr. Kühl. She did so. “There are 250.” “Now you are happy, and independent for life.” “And that poor innocent being in Siberia!” said she. Tears came to the eyes of the desolate little old lady, and the invalid half rose in her bed to gaze. “There is a reward, you know,” said Kühl. “Not a cent,” said Claude. “I would not mingle this pleasure with any interested feeling for the world.” “I thought as much,” said Kühl. “Who are you, sir?” said the lady, turning to Claude. “No matter. I will come and see you again by-and-by. In the mean time, you had better let Mr. Kühl take charge of your new-found prize, for it would not be pleasant to lose it again.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XV. The mightiest changes which take place in the human heart affect but little the outward world, and revolutions of the affairs of an individual interrupts but slightly the order of affairs. The societé of Berlin, as well as a large part of the people, went to Spandow to behold the mock seige of that fortress. Claude had Vol. II.—I determined to take no notice of the late occurrence which had so materially altered his condition, and not to shrink from being seen from any false shame. He determined to see this interesting military festival, and to mount his horse for the last time before he sold him. He therefore rode out with the crowd—carriages full of ladies and gentlemen, royal equipages, and thousands of equestrians and pedestrians: it was a general fête. When he reached Spandow, he left his horse at an inn and ascended the ramparts. The scene was already beginning to be animated. Large bodies of troops were disposed for defence upon the walls, and at the windows of the houses overlooking the ramparts, amounting to about twenty thousand; as many more were also disposed before the walls preparatory to the attack. For a long time crowds of spectators came thronging into the town. Claude secured a very good place on the ramparts, surrounded by troops, bombshells, cannons, etc. As he stood here, with a group of gentlemen, awaiting the opening of the attack, a young man of genteel address, but whom he had never met in society, addressed him in French. “This is a very pretty scene, sir. We shall have a good view as we stand.” Claude replied politely, and the stranger was pleased to continue the conversation. “Do you reside in Berlin?” inquired the young man. “I am a traveller,” said Claude. “I have been in Berlin during the winter.” “I hope you like our metropolis.” “Very much.” “Have you been much in society?” “Yes, a good deal.” “It is very brilliant, I believe.” “Very.” “Pray, were you acquainted with the parties in the late affair which has made so much noise?” “What affair?” asked Claude. “The duel and the poltroonerie of this Mr. Wyndham.” “Yes, I know the parties.” “Then, sir, you can perhaps give me some information upon a subject which is so generally talked of in all circles. Elkington, they say, castigated Wyndham, who dared not take up the quarrel, and who had been caught cheating at cards.” “I heard no such report,” said Claude, quietly, but shocked to find how little justice he could expect from common fame. “There was a dreadful fracas. Lord Elkington caught Wyndham with marked cards, and horse whipped him.” “No, no,” said another gentleman, standing near, “it wasn't cheating at cards, but the fellow was impertinent to a young countess whom Lord Elkington has come over here to marry, and Elkington challenged him. He was a great coward, as any one must be, sir, you know, to offer a rudeness to a lady; and, finding no other means available, Elkington tweaked his nose, kicked him down stairs, and afterward horsewhipped him. Pray, sir, were you there?” “I was.” “Did you witness the affair?” “I did.” “Then do tell us something about it. They say this Mr. Wyndham took as sound a drubbing as possible, without the slightest resistance.” “Why, what a sneaking rascal!” said the first. “That Elkington is a fine fellow. He drives a splendid turn-out. I've often seen him in the Park. He's a capital fellow, and perfectly the gentleman.” “He must be,” said the other. “I wish to goodness I had been there. It must have been very amusing. Pray tell us exactly how it was.” “Why, I fear I shall have to spoil your story,” said Claude, smiling. “But, if you wish, I will state the circumstances as far as I can gather the truth.” “Do—pray do. I've been these several days running about trying to get an authentic statement. I do like to see these explosions in high life. They're capital. Do tell us—” “Lord Elkington,” said Claude, “attacked a gentleman who was from principle opposed to duelling, and who had openly and often declared his determination never to fight—” “Well, that showed he was a coward at once,” said the young man. “To be sure it did,” said the other. “For what reason could a man have for not fighting a duel but cowardice?” “Certainly,” said the other. “He must be a contemptible rascal.” “The gentleman had been guilty of no wrong,” continued Claude, “but that of exposing a very dishonest trick of Elkington, and the latter gentleman struck him—” “Struck him? Well, after that—he had to fight, then?” “No, he declined; and, being of a peculiar mode of thinking on the subject of duelling, he rather preferred to bear even a blow than to deviate from what he thought the path of right—” “Ah, bah!” rejoined the other. “You may depend, he is an infamous coward. A man who talks about `principle,' and `virtue,' and `conscience,' and such trash when he is struck, you may be sure is a sneaking sort of fellow. What! take a blow? Why that's what no gentleman would do, sir, under any circumstance, right or wrong. If any one struck me, I would shoot him, and never after feel sorrow for it. I would —I would indeed. I would, sir, upon my honour. Wouldn't you, Bob?” “Certainly would I,” said Bob. “A man that would stand a blow would stand a kick—and a man that would stand a kick would stand having his nose tweaked—and a man that would stand having his nose tweaked must be a blackguard, and can't be a gentleman—for what but cowardice could keep a man from fighting when he had been struck and had his nose tweaked?” “Ah, there's the question. I agree with you exactly.” Claude moved a little away. There were a number of ladies and gentlemen standing around. Some of them he knew. They bowed to him coolly, and regarded him with curiosity. Once he heard a lady whisper to a young companion, “There, that's he!” and another lady touched her friend's shoulder, and whispered, “The person that was horsewhipped the other night by Lord Elkington.” And several lovely faces were turned towards him with curiosity and derision. As he stood, some time after, with his back turned to a group of young ladies, he heard them talking of the affair, which he perceived had excited universal attention. “Oh, good Lord!” said one, little aware that they were within hearing of the object of their remarks, “what a strange person he must be!” “Oh, Dieu! If I were a gentleman, I would rather be killed!” said another. “He will never be able to look any one in the face again,” added a third. “I was on the stairs the whole time,” said another. “Papa had just called us down; and we were stopped by the crowd, and then I stood and saw it all.” “Oh, I wish I had seen it; it must have been very interesting.” “Oh, yes it was, very, I assure you. Lord Elkington is so brave. He went up to Mr. Wyndham, and called him all sorts of names. Why, if he had done so to me, I couldn't have helped boxing his ears to save my life. He said he was a rascal—a coward—and all sorts of things.” “And what did Mr. Wyndham do then? Didn't he draw his sword?” I 2 “No, poor man; he was so extremely afraid, he didn't say a word.” “Ah, poor fellow!” cried the rest. And here was a general laugh. “Well, that is exceedingly funny. Pray go on.” “Then Mr. Wyndham said he couldn't fight a duel, and Lord Elkington walked up to him and struck him. I screamed right out. I thought I should have died with fright.” “Well, what then? I wish I had been there. It must have been so exceedingly interesting.” “Oh, it was, I assure you. It was as good as a play.” “Go on—go on.” “Well, then, after he had struck Mr. Wyndham, and kicked him about a little, till he was out of breath, poor Mr. Denham ran up, and called Lord Elkington a villain, and then Elkington struck him too; and Mr. Wyndham stood by all the time, and never said a word.” “The horrid wretch!” “Then poor Mr. Denham half drew his sword. He was just going to kill Elkington, and I was just going to faint, when out jumped little old General Le Beau, and Mr. Denham went away. And the next morning he was shot dead.” “And Mr. Wyndham never did anything about it?” “Never. Only think how horrid!” “Didn't shoot him?” “No.” “Isn't it ridiculous? What a pity Mr. Wyndham is such a coward?—he is such a handsome fellow.” “Oh, I never could endure him.” “How can you say so, Emily? He is the most beautiful young man I ever saw; so tall—so noble—oh, Heaven! what a pity he's such a coward.” “Dear me,” said the first, “look behind you.” There was a moment of deep silence, and then they all tripped away to another place, with a very unsuccessful attempt to suppress their laughter. Claude quietly kept his position. Presently a group of young men came by. He knew them all. Like everybody else, they were talking of him. “Well, I say,” said one, “no gentleman, whatever may be his principles, has a right to go in the face of society. If he's right, we're wrong. It's as much as to say we're ruffians.” “Certainly!” said another. “I don't think so,” said a third. “I find something noble in a man's adhering to his principles, whatever they are. They say any religion is better than none; and I say any principles are better than none.” “Ah, bah!” cried a gruff voice, “it's all stuff; the fellow's a coward, and takes this method to conceal it. I've no respect for a man who will not fight. He's a coward—and a blow, too! ah, bah!” “Oh, don't talk to me of principle. No one can be a gentleman—” “Yes, who can stand a blow?” demanded another. “Sir Walter Raleigh had a fellow spit in his face, and he did not return it,” said the advocate of Claude, though rather feebly. “Very well for Sir Walter Raleigh—” said the other. “But why, why,” said the voice of Lavalle, who now spoke up for the first time, “why is that magnanimous in Sir Walter Raleigh which is the reverse in Wyndham? I find him a noble fellow. In my opinion—no offence to any one—he is the bravest man I ever saw, and a man of high character and superior genius. I never saw anything so splendidly done as the manner he took the blow. I saw he did not really believe that Elkington would go so far after what he had said. He started aghast—and I thought he would have torn him limb from limb. Elkington was no coward, but he quailed himself before Wyndham's eye. I believe he would have killed him on the first impulse had he not been held. Talk of that man's being afraid, indeed! How calmly—how nobly—how beautifully his mind has quieted, and put down the fiery passions in his breast. I love that man. He is too noble for this age. I would rather have his friendship than that of any one's I ever saw!” “Well, well, perhaps so; he did look like the devil when he caught it. I'll do him the justice to say that.” “You may depend upon it, messieurs, he's a very fine fellow,” said Lavalle. “Well, I don't think so,” exclaimed another. “I think, after all his cant about principle and religion, a man who takes a blow is — must be a coward. A blow, you see, gentlemen, is a devilish serious thing. It's—a—a—d—d serious thing. It's, as one may say, the devil.” “So it is,” said another. “I would take anything but a blow.” “Or a kick,” cried one. “Or a tweak by the nose,” said another. “These are insults which ought to be paid for with blood.” “That is the creed among gentlemen,” said another. “But,” said Lavalle, “these things depend upon one's character and mode of thinking. Honour is in the mind, and the disgrace of a blow is conditional. If one receives it passively because one is afraid to resent it, then certainly a blow is a disgrace of the last extremity; but if one receives it, and refuses to seek the ordinary redress from a pure principle, because he believes that an intellectual man and a Christian ought to suffer any outward indignity rather than violate the law of God, I say that man is a character of the noblest order; and, just in the proportion in which he shocks the prejudices of mankind, and exposes himself to ridicule, misinterpretation, and odium, just in that proportion his abstaining from the vulgar mode of vengeance is grand and brave; and, since we are created in the image of our Maker, it should be our object to think and act like him.” There was a silence of a few moments; Claude had already wished to escape the impropriety of listening, but he was confined within a narrow compass by the crowd and the troops, and it was impossible for him to avoid it. The conversation was resumed by Thomson, who said, “In my opinion, Mr. Wyndham is a good-for-nothing fellow.” “Yes, he's a fool,” said a gruff voice; “even if he's not a coward, he is a fool for putting himself in a position so awkward and equivocal. I am no coward neither,” continued the gruff voice. “Egad, I'm not afraid of either Elkington or the world; but, from mere motives of policy, I wouldn't draw the eyes of all mankind on me—as the moral person who was kicked— as the religious gentleman who was knocked down— as the man of principle who got his nose tweaked.” There was here a general laugh. “Now suppose I were as much of a wag as I chose to be, and wanted some sport! Why, what would I do, you see? Why, the first time I saw my moral gentleman in a coffee house, I'd walk me up to him, with a `Good-evening to you, sir,' and give him a kick. I'd then take an ice or two, and, before I took my leave, what would I do? Why, just walk me up to him again, and fetch his nose a tweak, with, `Adieu, monsieur, au revoir!' Well, what's he to do to this? Nothing; he can't fight—he won't strike. Egad, every mischievous schoolboy might give him a kicking on their way to school—every garçon at a restaurant's might cuff his ears—there's no living with such principles.” “That's very true,” said Thomson. “If we were in Heaven—ah!—why, very well; but we aint.” “No, certainly not,” said Thomson. “Nor likely to be—some of us!” said Lavalle. “No,” said Thomson; and here again there was a general laugh. “Well, I'll answer to that,” said Lavalle, “that the wag who should strike a man wantonly, merely because he was secure against retaliation, and that man one who refrained from taking personal vengeance out of respect to the laws, society, and religion, would be a scoundrel so despicable, that I, for one, would not associate with him, nor frequent the company he keeps. Against such a person the laws would interfere, and probably he would find himself in a prison before long. I begin to think with Wyndham, that men who grope about for ages in darkness, till some superior being shows the way out of it, only want a few resolute persons of undoubted courage and honour to set their faces against duelling, and to surrender to the laws the charge of punishing personal assaults as well as all kinds of insults, to render duelling unfashionable and boxing vulgar. What a world of misery would then be saved to society—what widows' and orphans' tears and groans!” “But society would become a pack of fellows without chivalry, without honour, and men would spit in each other's faces with impunity.” “No. Where, among the leaders of society, and particularly among women, the duellist was looked upon as the thief now is, and he who had even dared— stirred on by his vulgar and blind passions—to desecrate God's holy image with a blow, would be considered as base as the destroyer of female innocence, or the blasphemer of God himself; then, instead of brute force, mechanical steadiness of hand and practice of the eye—instead of vile, undiscriminating vengeance and beastly fury, all the differences of men would be referred to tribunals, and the inevitable evils which might be detected in such a state of things would be only incidental to mortal affairs—” “But such unresenting men would be trampled on by some one.” “No. Who strikes a woman?” “Ah, but that's different thing—that's disgraceful.” “But why? Because it is the custom—because she does not fight.” “But would you make women of us all?” said the gruff voice. “If you must be either women or brutes, yes,” said Lavalle, quickly. The booming cannon, which had for some time been heard at times and in the distance, now approached and shook the air at shorter intervals, and the besiegers advancing, directed a heavy fire against the part of the walls where Claude stood. It was immediately returned; and cannon, musketry, bombs, and all the dreadful machinery of war filled the air with fire and smoke, and caused the earth to tremble. The tumult and roar became at once so general as to cut short all conversation. In the confusion which reigned everywhere, he was several times in contact with his old acquaintances, of whom some were affable as usual, but by far the greater part were cold, and many pretended not to recognise him in the least. Among them he saw the Carolans. None of their party perceived him but Ida. Her eyes met his a moment as he passed. They were full of gravity and sadness, but he made no attempt to offer her any token of recognition, but followed the example she had set, and they parted thus coldly and in silence. A short time afterward he found himself nearly alone. The crowd of soldiers had been repulsed by the assailants, who had gained an entrance in the fort, but had succeeded in rallying, and were driving them back in their turn. Claude did not follow them. His heavy heart took no share in this animated and beautiful spectacle, which presented a perfect counterpart of a fierce battle, every spot being crowded with combatants, and even the very windows and house-tops pouring forth their sheets of fire and smoke; whose heavy masses, rolling slowly through the air, rendered the striking scene only dimly visible here and there. He leaned against a post which had been lifted at some distance from the present scene of action, which was nearly hidden from him by the volumes of smoke; and he was conscious of the wish, that, instead of a mock battle, the wild uproar raging around was a real conflict. “Perhaps, then,” he thought, “some ball might end a life which seems doomed to humiliation and sorrow, or at least I should have an opportunity, by mingling in its dangers, to forget the events that are pressing me into the dust.” It was one of those thoughts which sometimes come across the most sensible mind in a moment of idleness and despondency. As if for affording him an opportunity to test its sincerity, a whizzing sound in the air caught his ear, and, at the same instant, a sharp shock struck the post within a few feet of his head. On examining it, with surprise he perceived that a bullet had lodged in it. Greatly startled at an occurrence which he concluded to be purely accidental, he sprang back, without any remnant of the desire which had just been so inopportunely realized; but that the shot was not the result of chance was immediately made manifest, for another ball whizzed by his ear, and struck a large stone on the bank beside which he was standing. Appalled with a mysterious horror, he looked in the direction from which this dark attempt had proceeded. Through the smoke he could just see a line of houses, the outskirts of the old town within the walls, from the upper windows of each of which the troops were pouring a rapid discharge of musketry, although not in the direction in which he was standing.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XVI. It was night when Claude reached his hotel—amid all his troubles, happy in the consciousness that they were incurred without wrong on his own part, and delighted with the happiness he had been the means of communicating to the poor old lady, and the acquittal which he had caused to the innocent stranger. “There is a pretty company waiting for you up stairs,” said the waiter who had presented the bill. “A pretty company?” “Oui, monsieur. Very pretty. Keh! don't be impatient. They be not run away.” At a loss to conceive to what this impertinence referred, he mounted to his room. In the little antechamber sat three persons, of whom one was a youth dressed in a very pretending way. The other was a plain-looking man; the third an athletic person of forty. His uncommon stature, brawny hands, and broad shoulders gave token of great muscular strength. Each had a bill in his hand, and each stepped up to him at once and handed their accounts. They were messengers from a tailor, a livery-stable keeper, and a barber. The latter was he whose toilet had at first made upon him the impression of a young nobleman, with his long mustache, his carefully dressed hair, his elegant clothes, the whiteness and delicacy of his hands, and the general imitation of a person of rank. His bill was for soap, perfumes, brushes, honing razors, cutting hair, and numerous other matters. It amounted to 20 thalers. The coach bill, and that for keeping the saddle-horse, amounted to the more serious sum of 100 thalers; while the tailor held out a “rechnung,” at the bottom of which a total of 290 thalers stared him in the face. Perhaps few novel-writers could subject their hero to a crisis so unromantic, but they could scarcely lead him into one more disagreeable. Haunted castles, blood-stained floors, and gliding spectres, with all the paraphernalia of Mrs. Radcliffe's or Maturin's stories, would have been more tolerable to Claude than these three bills of paper at the present moment. The idea of being in debt mastered his fortitude. It was precisely the thing for which the consciousness of virtue offered no consolation, and wisdom and philosophy no remedy. He could neither advance, stand still, nor retreat. He could neither tell the truth nor remain silent; and the intruders, who had thus early come, Vol. II.—K like ominous seabirds before a storm, to give him a melancholy foretaste of poverty, were not long in discovering his confusion; and their manners changed at once from their usual exuberant respect to mingled astonishment and insolence. There are few men who look upon a debtor but as in some degree their property. Pecuniary responsibility generally breaks al ties—absolves from all courtesy—raises the creditor to the eminence of a despot, and often inspires him with the desire of exercising the arbitrary power of one. The helpless debtor must be suspected, accused, insulted in silence. The attacks of others are unsupported by self-approbation and the natural independence of a man. He is a slave, chained to be spit upon by the angry and laughed at by the unfeeling; and his own heart, alas! joins his enemies, and pleads against him. “You must come in next day after to-morrow,” said Claude. “Ah, keh!” said the barber. “Diable, monsieur! Do you believe I have nothing to do but run after— after—non, monsieur!” “You are going to quit Berlin,” said the groom. “No, upon my honour.” “Ah, keh! honour!—diable!—when you don't pay your debts!” said the barber, putting on his hat, knocking it down over his eyes, and thrusting his hands into his trousers pockets. “I assure you,” said Claude, quietly, “I do not mean to leave Berlin.” “That's a lie, monsieur,” said the groom. “Your passport has been stopped, or you would have been off before now.” Claude stepped towards the last speaker, and was going to put him out of the room, when he reflected that the man knew no better, and that, alas! he had some cause to think as he spoke. He paused, with a shame and incertitude which the debtor must often feel. “You are a very impudent fellow,” said he. “Eh, bah!” said the barber; “a pretty gentleman! —awh—honour! ha! ha! ha! Voila! monsieur. There's my bill; I don't stir till it's paid.” The tailor's man now stepped up. “Mr. Wyndham, can you give me the money or any security?” “No.” “Well, sir, you are a—swindler, sir! and, if I had you in a field, I'd give you the soundest drubbing you ever had in your life. Mind, sir, I warn you, the first time I meet you in the street, I'll—a gentleman, indeed! —an adventurer! I've half a mind—” The man shook his huge fist so near his face that it touched his nose. There are few men who could avoid plunging into a brawl upon such provocation, and fewer novelists who would have the hardihood, in spite of the prejudices of the age, to represent a patient sufferer of such opprobrious terms and insulting actions. But Claude's mind was high, calm, and reflective; and it is one of the blessings of great sacrifices that they render minor ones more easy. Claude, who had borne a blow from the hand of a gentleman, under the most aggravated circumstances which could attend such a humiliating infliction, saw nothing to drive him from his balance in the brutality of uneducated and coarse men, in the exercise of what they deemed their duty, and who would have been much better pleased with him had he been imprudent enough to put himself on a level with them by commencing a collision. He said, therefore, without passion, “My good friends, I owe you money. I am unable to pay you at present, in consequence of a misfortune. You have your remedy, if you think it worth adopting. I shall not leave Berlin, and—you must take your course.” His calmness appeared to puzzle the men, and even to abate the indignation of all, except the barber. So true it is that a mild word turneth away wrath. “You must be aware, monsieur,” said the tailor, “that 290 thalers is a large sum to lose for a poor, hard-working man like me—with a large family, too.” “Indeed,” said Claude, “I will do all in my power to prevent your losing it. I shall not leave Berlin—be assured I shall not; and you should remember that, in using the language of insult towards me, you are condemning me before you know whether I deserve it.” “Eh, keh! diable!” said the barber; “laissez nous!” “Have you any prospect of ever paying me?” asked the tailor. “No, frankly,” said Claude, “in money; I have not, at least, any certain prospect. I am totally ruined; but I shall do my best to prevent any one's losing; and, moreover, the greater part of the clothes you have made for me are in that wardrobe; you may take them if you will, this moment.” The man seemed as much surprised by the beginning as by the end of this reply. He answered with greater respect, “Well, I will take the clothes.” “It is but just you should,” said Claude. And, opening the wardrobe, he laid out the whole contents of his wardrobe, much of which was scarcely worn, besides the court suit, which our poor fortune-hunted traveller did not see thus pass away without a sigh over the brilliant associations—the royal halls— the midnight suppers—the delightful dinners—and the hours spent in company of one he was now, perhaps, never to see again, which it conjured up. The man swung them on his shoulders, and with an awkward bow went away. Claude then sat down and wrote an order for the horse. “For you,” said he to the groom, “you can take your master this. It is my authority to sell the horse, and indemnify himself, as far as possible, for the loss I have occasioned him.” The man took it and also went away. “Et moi, monsieur!” said the barber, folding his arms insolently, and standing close to Claude with his feet a yard apart. “There is your money,” said Claude; “write me a receipt.” The man did so. The money was, by a curious chance, the very last groschen he had in the world. There was even a penning—the smallest coin—deficient. “Monsieur, there is wanting a penning,” said the man. “I have no more.” “I can change a bill,” said the barber. “I have no bill,” said Claude. “Eh! keh!” said the little dandy. “It appears, monsieur, that I am just in time. Ha! ha! ha! parbleu! Au revoir, mon cher!” “Well, now I am at the worst.” But he was not at the worst. Poverty never is; low as it may be, there is always a chosen step lower in humiliation and misery. It is at the worst only in the grave. “Ah, Ida!” thought he, “little do you dream, amid your stately grandeur—” His reflection was cut short. The door opened without a knock, and a stranger entered. He had under his arm a large package of papers. He was followed by a second—a polite little man, plainly dressed; behind him stood two more— stout, rough, grave-looking fellows, each with a large club; and in the shadow of the corridor, half seen, stood yet a fifth, whose stature and proportion were greater than those of his companions, and who also leaned silently upon a heavy cane. Claude started at this apparition. “I beg your pardon,” said the first. “I have come to arrest you, at the suit of Count Carolan, for £50.” “It is not possible!” said Claude. “I am very sorry—it is a most painful duty—but it is a duty, and my instructions are—positive.” K 2 “There must be some mistake,” said Claude. “Certainly Count Carolan would not—could not—” “I beg your pardon—I received his commands in person,” said the polite man. “I am his lawyer. I hope you will excuse us; but you know, my dear sir, our profession has its unpleasant features—and in this we are but the mere instruments of another.” “And where must I go?” “To the debtor's jail in — street.” “Why, I have been told that is the receptacle for the refuse of the town,” said Claude, drawing back with considerable alarm. “There is a more respectable prison?” “Unfortunately, that is full.” “But there is a mode,” said Claude, “by which I may be arrested differently—by which I may be guarded in a separate room.” “These are privileges reserved only for people of a certain standing in society.” “But—I—” said Claude, “my position—I was assured—my claim to belong to that class—” “So we thought,” said the lawyer; “but Count Carolan refused to listen to it. He said you did not belong to that class, and had no claim to the privileges of une personne distinguée.” “I am ready,” said Claude. “Will monsieur like me to call a droskey?” said one of the men. “Yes, certainly—no,” said Claude, remembering he was penniless. The sturdy bailiffs, shouldering their clubs, surrounded him, and he passed into the street. As he left the door of his hotel a splendid equipage drove by, the coachman and two chasseurs in the richest livery. He recognised the carriage of Carolan. The count himself was in it, with Ida. He caught a rapid glance at her face as they dashed by. They were probably going to a ball. Perhaps it might have been from the light of the street-lamps, but the face of Ida appeared sad and pale. “Go on, fair and sweet girl,” thought Claude; “thou to the bright haunts of pride and pleasure—I to prison and despair.” He went on his way to the prison, envying the meanest of the careless crowd about him, who, whatever were their privations, had at least their freedom. He passed by many a gay-lighted shop, full of people— many a café, where young officers and élegans were sipping their cream or coffee. He passed the theatre—its windows lighted—and the armed horseman stationed in the middle of the street before the door, guarding the votaries of pleasure from any interruption. Some of the passengers were hastening by, humming; the little boys, as if prisons and miseries had no existence, were shouting in their careless sports; laughter and music met his ears; and the very barking of the dog had in it something careless, something free, which contrasted mournfully with his situation. Once a sudden melody from a band of wind instruments broke from a neighbouring street. Soft—plaintive—slow, it swelled upon the air till he passed close to the musicians, who retreated behind him, their sweet strains dying away like the last relic of happiness—and of the world. His way lay through the Schloss, that vast and gloomy pile, whose immense courts, towering walls, and heavy sculpture impressed the mind with a vague sense of horror and grandeur. A part of it was white in the moonlight, while its broad angles and massive buttresses threw the rest into black shadows. Often had he lingered amid these stately courts, touched with their huge and solemn character, and many an hour had fleeted away in their gorgeous apartments. The guards paced to and fro before the arches and along the balconies. Several domestics in the royal livery were passing formally across the broad and worn pavement. A carriage, easily distinguishable as that of one of the royal family, was drawn up at the foot of a broad flight of stone stairs. So susceptible was Claude to picturesque beauty in the common scenes of life, that he paused to gaze with a kind of pleasant awe at these high-towering walls, crowned with statues, and their dark irregular summits marked along the sky—and the stars—the moon—the all that was visible above through the few filmy clouds, drifting with a soft, silent motion, apparently close along the high roofs. He forgot that he was a captive as his eye measured these lofty walls. “Allons, monsieur, allons,” said one of the men, touching his shoulder slightly with his extended fingers, “we have no time to lose.” And he proceeded on his course, without again looking around or above till he reached the prison. The building was a large, dark-looking edifice of great extent. The windows were in the shadow, but the grated bars were distinguishable, and their lower parts were strongly boarded up. One look around at the broad square, of which this receptacle formed the prominent feature—at the shoreless, tranquil, ever-bright heavens—and the door was opened with a clanking noise of chains and bolts, was shut again with the same ominous sounds, and he was within the walls of a jail. His reflections on entering it were not rendered less gloomy by the consciousness that he was there for a just debt, which he scarcely believed it would ever be in his power to pay. His conductors led him, with a sinking heart, into a low, smoked room, dimly lighted by a tallow candle. There were some white pine-board furniture, consisting of desks, dirty engravings, &amp;c. Here they demanded his money. He had none. They required to search him. He submitted. The man exchanged a few trivial remarks upon matters in no way connected with him, and had one or two jokes about something which had happened during the day, and at which they laughed heartily. In the midst of these a new face appeared with a large key. It was that of his jailer. He was an athletic man with a good-humoured countenance. “Bon soir, monsieur,” said he. “Allons, you must come with me.” He led the way up one flight of naked, desolate stairs; long, dismal corridors stretched from the landing-place on either hand. They mounted yet another flight. Things here looked even more dismal. The air was close and fetid, and impregnated with sickening odours, among which the fumes of bad tobacco were pre-eminent. He followed his new master—as a felon—to a door, from which he withdrew the bolts, and which he then unlocked. The massive key turned twice with a clanking spring ere the last barrier between poverty and the happy world was passed, and Claude found himself in a filthy and extremely bad-smelling apartment, crowded with unhappy wretches, the smoke of a just extinguished candle filling his throat and nostrils. A dozen common straw beds lay on the floor, each belonging to a prisoner. It was eleven at night. The men, although they had evidently been up—and Claude detected near the candle the end of a pack of dirty cards thrust hastily beneath some clothes—made a great parade of rising and putting on their clothes. One said, “Light the candle;” another, “Where's the phosphorus?” and presently their candle was again lighted and their garments put on. “Good. Here you are at last!” said the jailer, with a benevolent smile; and then withdrawing, he closed the door and doubly locked it, the whole company shaking their fingers at him, with many expressions of derision or rage, as he disappeared. All was now curiosity among the prisoners. They gathered around the new-comer with a freedom and a familiarity which he knew not how to avoid as little as to endure. His tall, noble form—his air of good-breeding and affluence—the elegance of his dress, created as great a sensation as that produced by Gulliver when found by the Lilliputians. At length one of them came up to him, and asked, with marks of curiosity, “Are you here for debt?” “Yes.” “Have you got any money?” demanded another. “No.” “But how are you arrested at this time of night?” “That's not legal,” said a second. “No, indeed,” rejoined a third. And then they drew up together in a corner, and held a kind of council of war, canvassing the cruelty and illegality of such a measure, and declaring that he would be “out to-morrow.” In the mean time, one took his hat and another his gloves. One offered to make tea—another proposed coffee; and, notwithstanding his attempts to withdraw himself from such friendly obligations, one of his companions had a spirit-lamp lighted, and by the aid of some hot water, and in an old, broken, dirty teapot, with three or four leaves of bad tea, boiled for ten minutes, he presently produced what he was pleased to offer as “a good, strong cup of tea.” Claude took it and attempted to drink. It seemed a type of his bitter and mean destiny, and he felt that he could not too soon begin to accustom himself to the loathsome draught. Besides, he was reluctant to offend the unhappy beings who, however rude and different from the polished companions of his past hours, seemed, at least kind in their intentions. They were coarse, vulgar, and repulsive, but alas! they were all the friends he had left. A vacant bed of straw was pointed out to him as that he was to occupy. Before they retired he found great differences in their character. One was a dissolute knave in every word and action, and he was the most familiar with him. Another was really kind, and comparatively disinterested. The rascal (who one of them whispered had once before been in another prison for robbery) approached him, and joined him as he walked up and down the narrow floor. He told him, in a few words, how the prisoners lived. “They had two meals a day, handed up in large pails. The coarsest, cheapest food which could support life. They had one hour a day to exercise in a kind of court a few yards square, itself full of putrid odours. The light was to be put out every night at ten. All friends coming to visit them were to pay at the door two and a half groschen. Some of the prisoners were here for fifteen cents; and whoever remained a year, had the right to go out at the end of that period, and could not again be confined for the same debt.” “Now I,” said the man, “have come here of my own accord. They dunned me to death at home; so I've come here to spend my year like a gentleman, and then—keh! I'm free as the best of 'em. Pooh! don't be down-hearted, my buck! it's nothing when you are once a little used to it. We smoke—play cards—smuggle in our bottle of rum—and live like the king. Look here,” said he, and he opened a kind of brown paper coffer full of pipes, cheese, black bread, bottles, tallow candles, tobacco, and half-smoked segars. “Here is some rum—take a drop—it'll make you sleep. They don't generally sleep the first two or three nights, but you'll soon get used to it. If you don't go out and in for two or three months, you won't feel it at all. I have been here now nine months. I'm quite sorry I'm getting through so fast. Come, cheer up!” And he laid his hand somewhat facetiously on Claude's shoulder. He shook it off, not from anger so much as a repugnance, which he was not aware he had expressed so clearly. “Ah! you're particular in your acquaintance, maybe. Well, that's all very well; but beggars shouldn't be choosers. A gentleman as can't pay his debts oughtn't to carry his head quite so high—no offence, I hope, sir.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XVII. Claude walked the room till morning, grasping at a thousand expedients to extricate himself from his disagreeable dilemma. The idea of imprisonment has a moral effect upon the mind which no one can conceive who has not experienced it. The circumstances of his own confinement, too, were peculiarly painful. Had he been thrown into a dungeon for a crime of which he was innocent, he could much better have supported the misfortune than he now found himself able to do the consciousness that he was imprisoned for a cause held by all mankind to be a good and sufficient one. He racked his brain for some means of paying Carolan, whose cruel conduct sunk deeply into his heart as he contrasted the dark, dirty walls—the miserable, dilapidated room and furniture—the greasy and ragged beings who were his companions, with the brilliant circle and magnificent halls, in the midst of which his oppressor was probably moving at that instant. He did not feel indignation or a desire of vengeance so much as he felt surprise and wonder, that one in Carolan's position could be so deaf to the dictates of common humanity and common decency as to crush so remorselessly into the earth—without examination or forbearance—one who, at least, was a fellow-being. Sad and dark were the thoughts with which he beguiled the hours of that long and sleepless night, walking the floor after all his fellow-lodgers were asleep. How strangely the scenes of the past year rose upon his memory! How varied and yet swift had been his course to his present condition! All those whom he had made acquaintance with—the young, the fair, the happy, the free — appeared to him. Ida—bright, radiant, gorgeous—as he had first seen her—and pale and sad, as she had crossed him that night—was he beloved by that tender and beautiful being? Amid the scenes in which she moved, was her heart with him in this rude abode? Ah, yes; and for a moment the idea of her sympathy touched the rough walls with sweetness, and made the stained boards beneath his feet soft as a path of roses. Poor Denham's pale and bloody face here rose to him, startling his tender dreams with the ghostly visage of death—and the mysterious assassin, with his uplifted dagger—and Elkington—and the blow. His frame was agitated, his blood heated and feverish; and human life seemed such a solemn and strange medley—such a mockery—that again dark ideas of self-destruction dashed across his mind, and he thought that in one moment he could end his gloomy and harrowing pains, and sleep—with poor Denham—where “poison nor fire” could touch him farther. It required all his habitual self-command to shake himself free from these excited thoughts. Nor would he, perhaps, have been able to do so but for one reflection, which is a support to the upright mind in the darkest hour of distress and peril. He had nothing to accuse himself of. He had not, at least knowingly, done wrong. Nay, more (for his principles were so fixed that they did not waver even while enduring the painful consequences of them), he had done right. He had sacrificed himself to his sense of duty. Thus far the results had been ruin and humiliation—a stained name—cooled friends—triumphant enemies. But he knew that, as in the game of whist, although bad play sometimes succeeds, and the observance of skill fails, these results are but accidental and temporary chances, and in no way alter the general value of fixed and wise rules of action. One hope struck him: that by the aid of St. Hillaire—Lavalle—Digby—Kühl, etc., he might procure such a security against his departure from Berlin as would release him from the actual limits of a prison. Vol. II.—L It was then his intention to boldly and openly abandon all pretensions to admission in the societé to which he had been accustomed—to give lessons in English or French, for he was perfectly capable of both—to live with an economy as strict as health and decency would permit—and to toil with ardour till he could accumulate sufficient to discharge all the obligations he had contracted. Rossi, who depended on him, and poor Mrs. Denham, occurred to him; but the pang which he experienced on account of not being able to continue to them the assistance he had promised, he felt would be manly to bear with patience, and yet wiser to dismiss altogether from his mind. He repeated the line from our great poet, “What is done, is done,” and “Things without remedy should be without regard.” Wisdom, although flowing from the murderer's lips. The pale morning broke upon his meditations. As daylight dawned his companions arose. They looked, in the clearer beams of day, more repulsive and hideous. Their clothes were miserable—their persons filthy—their breath rank. Many wore no other article of dress than a large robe de chambre of greasy sheepskin, the wool turned next their skin. They had diseases, some of them—eyes sore and inflamed by debauchery—and noses red and carbuncled. These were the men who, in a general spirit of benevolence, he had wished to receive on some terms of equality. Now he shrunk from them with an aversion which he could neither conquer nor conceal. They were his fellow-creatures, with immortal souls like his own, but, thus fallen—by whatever cause—he found them loathsome and unendurable. Fearful decrees of Providence, which renders one unhappy mortal so far beneath another that nature revolts, and the sweet theories of humanity fall before their touch! The breakfast was brought up at eight—a mass of greasy soup, which he could not eat. “You have no money?” inquired the jailer, who perceived he did not eat. “None!” “Ah, but you'll get nothing else. You must come to it at last.” “Perhaps the gentleman would like a roasted chicken and some Champagne!” said his rude acquaintance of the previous evening. “Bring us a few strawberries and cream,” cried a second. “Will you take them with or without sugar?” asked the first; and there was a general grin. The prospect of being without food was seriously alarming, and Claude begged paper, pens, and a messenger to carry a note. “Where's your cash to pay for these things?” said the man. “I am sure—that is, I hope—my friend will pay.” “Ah! so,” said the man. “And cannot I have a room to myself?” “Keh! diable—no,” said the man. “Is that a reasonable request? You're not in a hotel. Why you more than they?” “The gentleman is of a thoughtful disposition, and fond of solitude,” said his persecutor. “I myself should like an apartment looking out on a garden, with a balcony.” This facetiousness was received with a general laugh. “Take my watch,” said Claude, “and let me have a little money on it till I can see my friends.” The man shook his head. On a greasy table, with broken legs, and polished by being used not a little as a seat, Claude wrote a letter to Digby, begging him to come and see him. The messenger took it, and soon returned. The gentleman was not at home, but Claude felt relieved. The idea of quitting the room and company in which he now found himself was his principal desire. It seemed that this alone would almost make him happy. Alas! how were his wishes narrowed since the time when he dreamed of palaces—and equipages—and Ida hanging on his arm, a fond and happy wife! Every moment in his present position was almost insupportable. The rough humour, mixed with malice, of his enemy—for, although he had not been twelve hours in this den of common misery, he had (poor human nature!) already an enemy—had gained the rest to his side. His undisguiseable repugnance to their familiarity, and his desire to escape from contact with them, were observed, and resented by nearly all; and they endeavoured to make his situation as uncomfortable as possible, as some meaner birds of prey might pick at Prometheus while chained and writhing under the beaks of his fierce vulture. “Don't mind 'em, sir,” said a wretched little hunchback. “They're a rough set, and don't know how to behave. Forgive them. They don't know what they do.” The words of our Saviour, unconsciously uttered by this ignorant creature! Claude held out his hand for his, and shook it heartily. “My honest fellow, one day you and I shall be better acquainted, perhaps.” His air and manner struck even those rude eyes, and for some time there was a cessation of hostilities. In the mean time, where was Digby? Every time the door opened, he started. A hundred times his heart beat quick, as he thought he heard his friend's step; but still he did not come. The day wore away. Night came. No reply from him. At ten, Claude, exhausted, lay down upon his couch, but he could not sleep. He fell sometimes into that dreadful state of dozing, when all the stings of reality seem sharpened, and the soul is given up to its horrors without the support of waking reason. He was oppressed with frightful dreams. He started often. Sometimes he thought himself falling off a precipice; sometimes the ghostly image of Denham glided over him, and once he woke screaming, with the dagger of his assassin glimmering over him in the shadow, and in the act of piercing his heart. He thought now he should be obliged to remain a year in prison. What hope had he of relief? How could he ever pay his debts? A year with his present associates would cause him to contract foul diseases—would make him, perhaps, as unclean and gross as they! He rose again to escape from these dreadful apprehensions. His eyeballs burned, his head ached, and he found vermin crawling over him. “Ah! Carolan,” he thought, “may Heaven forgive you. I fear I never can, ruthless—bitter oppressor! And this is the bland and polished man I met with so much pleasure—the smiling, elegant, hospitable, affluent leader of rank and fashion. How little do we know men from seeing them in society—from dining with them—from being with them in assemblies of pleasure! How few reflect, while they enjoy this person's profuse hospitality and accept his courteous attentions, that, were they once beneath his grasp— were they once to offend his pride—they would be thrust, unpitied, into a loathsome dungeon—deprived of light, air, exercise, food—left to mourn—to die, perhaps, within these dismal walls, while music, and laughter, and the giddy dance are going on almost within sound of their groans; and when this man comes to die—as the richest, the greatest must—will no stern image of his victim frown pale and accusing by his bedside? Will he be called to no account for the pangs his jewelled hand has inflicted? for the misery which a word from his bland lips could have spared? Ah! cruel and thoughtless enemy. The ways of God are fearful, and you may one day feel with horror the bitterness which the captive drinks— the cruelty of trampling on the helpless!” Morning again broke, and again the breakfast came. He took a cup and ate. His face was so pale and haggard, that, although his tormentor ventured a jest upon the recovery of his appetite, it was received in L 2 silence by the circle of by-standers, who proceeded to light their pipes without paying him any more attention. The food, which had looked so loathsome, tasted better than he expected. It was clean, and not disagreeable. “Besides,” thought he, “it is my fare. Hunger brings down pride, and misery learns to bow. Alas! it is a useful lesson.” He now wrote a note to the English embassy, with the members of which he had a passing acquaintance. It was answered in an hour, by an order from the director of the prison to put him in a room by himself, and give him every attention compatible with his security; and his heart leaped within him in being shown into a cleaner room down stairs, fronting on the square. The lower half of the windows were boarded up, but there was a small hole in each one of them through which he could look into the street. There was also a bedstead and a bed, a wash-hand basin and water, a wooden chair, and a table with four legs. Moreover, he was here alone. His first moment of solitude in this new chamber was one of exquisite pleasure. The man said he had also procured 50 thalers on his watch and seals, which he held at his orders, and he agreed to send in better food from an adjoining restaurant. The good-humoured jailer seemed to sympathize with him in his delight, and said, “You'll be better here, won't you? I'm glad they gave you this room.” This expression of kindness touched Claude's heart. He had scarcely been an hour alone when Digby came in. His face wore an expression of the deepest indignation which Claude had seen there yet, and there was also perceptible in his manner a certain roughness and want of respect very different from that he had usually adopted towards him. “Well, how are you, Mr. Wyndham?” said he. “Sorry to see you here—a—a—these things will—a —happen; but you musn't think yourself the only unfortunate—a—a—man in the world; I—I—also have my griefs.” “What griefs?” said Claude, who, even in his misfortune, had a heart open to those of others. “Mary—our Mary—the little—ungrateful—a—a— fool—has—a—a—eloped from us.” “Great Heaven!” said Claude. “Yes—and with that—a—” (he looked around as if to assure himself that his formidable foe could not hear him) “infamous—profligate Elkington. She left a— note—to me—stating that `he had promised to marry her—that I must not be either alarmed or angry—that we should meet again in London—and that she should receive us as the Countess of Beverly.”' “What incredible infatuation!” said Claude; “what black-hearted villany!” “I think, moreover, that her mother was—a—a— privy to her flight, sir; I—she—” he drew out his handkerchief, and wept a few moments in silence. “Indeed, this pains as much as it surprises me,” said Claude. “D—n them, let them go!” said Digby, rising in wrath; “she is no daughter of mine. I disinherit her —I disown her; and as for her mother—” This intelligence greatly astonished Claude, and he sympathized deeply with the bereaved father. “Let them go,” said Digby. “I shall never utter her name again. What did you want to see me for?” he demanded, abruptly. “Ah, at this moment I cannot think of intruding my affairs upon you.” “I'm very sorry for you, I'm sure,” said Digby; “but these things happen every day, and they must be borne. I was in jail once twenty-four hours myself. I did not mind it. It's nothing, after all. Imagine yourself in a ship—or indisposed—or that it rains. It is the very same thing. You've an excellent room here. What's the amount of your debt?” “Fifty pounds!” “Ah, fifty pounds! Bless me! a good round sum. How are you going to pay it? You have funds, I hope.” “No, not a cent.” “Ah—ah! that's bad! What are you going to do about it?” Claude, although chilled by this cold and careless air, which he did not expect, related to him his plan to procure security and teach English. “Ah—ah! security—for your appearance—hey? Yes—but whom have you fixed upon? You have a plenty of friends, I believe. I'll tell you who'd be your security in a minute—if you'd ask her; and I have no objection—for it sha'n't be said of me that I deserted a friend in distress—to see her privately myself. She'll plank the money in two seconds—I'm quite sure she will. I should not mind asking her right up and down—right out and out—that's the way to do business.” “Whom do you mean?” “That young Countess Ida!” Claude started. “What, you won't?” “Certainly not.” “Oh—ah! you'll think of it, perhaps. You'll take a different view of it when you have been here a week or so. Well, I've an engagement myself at present; my head's so battered with the thoughts of my poor Mary, that I scarcely know—a—a—I'm on my head or my heels. If I can do anything in the world for you, you may command me.” “Mr. Digby,” said Claude, “I will be frank with you. I am here under extremely disagreeable circumstances, and I wish to be released on bail for my appearance. I intended to solicit this favour of you. It is but a nominal risk. I need not explain that you are liable for the debt only in case of my running away, which I hope you feel there's no danger of.” “What's the amount?” said Digby, turning very red. “Fifty pounds. If I get out I can make my living; if I remain here, I really can't see how I am to do anything.” “Well, well, I'll think of it. I'll—see Mrs. Digby,” said Digby. “No,” said Claude, “it is not requisite; the service I ask of you is not one which requires consideration. Say yes or no, and relieve me from farther suspense. Will you deposite the money in court for my appearance?” “Why we—you see—a—I—the fact is, my dear fellow, since we left London, the—a—a—times are hard—devilish hard. My agent writes me of very serious losses. Nothing on earth would give me greater pleasure than to oblige you; but money, you know, is —a—a—money; and I have long ago—a—a—made a resolution never to become security, under any circumstances, for—a—a—any man. Besides, I'm going back to London immediately; and, in fact, I come to make my parting visit. I hope, with all my heart, you'll get out of your difficulty,” he continued, shaking very heartily the hand which Claude did not refuse; “I do, Wyndham, upon my soul I do. Any commands for London?” “None.” “Well, adieu — good-by. God bless you! My heart bleeds to see you here;” and, very red in the face, Digby withdrew. He was no sooner gone than several officers of the court came to prosecute the suit against him in behalf of Carolan. He had been arrested so abruptly in consequence of Carolan's complaint that he was about to elude the debt by flight. He confessed the amount at once, without defence or explanation. By this proceeding about a hundred thalers were added to the original sum. Several more days passed in this way. No one came to see him. At length he was brought up to court to hear the judgment pronounced. He was ushered into a neat, small room, where three gentlemen on the bench and two clerks, with two or three bailiffs and Count Carolan's lawyer, composed all the company. One of the judges had dined in company with him at Carolan's several times, and discovered a disposition to cultivate his acquaintance. This same person now regarded him with cool, quiet indifference, with which he would have looked upon any other prisoner. The sentence was read, and he was condemned to remain in prison till the debt was paid. He was at once reconducted to his dreary dwelling; and, with a fainting soul, he felt, as the doors once more closed upon him, as if he were stepping into his grave. A week more elapsed. No one visited him; and he was determined, after the unexpected rebuff received from Digby, not to solicit the attention of any other friend—not of St. Hillaire—not even of Lavalle. He borrowed a few books, but his money was rapidly gliding away, and he trembled to lay out a cent for anything but the actual necessities of life. He found he was obliged to pay two thalers a month for the bed; and every sheet of paper he used, and every message he sent, cost him something. His food was also expensive; and, although he denied himself all luxuries, he could not avoid spending comparatively a great deal. Here—abandoned — sad — hopeless — without occupation—without company—he learned the use of money. Every groschen he expended was first carefully considered. He had no soap, no napkins; his washing was obliged to be curtailed, and the luxury of clean linen to be surrendered. In four weeks he had altered in appearance. Accustomed to much air and exercise, the confinement debilitated him. His face grew thin and pale, and his spirits sad. He felt as if about to lose his health. Pains and aches came over him. He was pining for air—for the sight of men— of nature. He thought the world was a passed thing with him—a vanished dream. He thought he should speedily step from his dismal abode into the last, and, perhaps, scarcely less cheerless refuge of the captive —the grave.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XVII. One day, after he had been about two months in this situation, he heard, early in the morning, the tread of several clumsy feet on the stairs. There was a small aperture in his door filled with glass, through which the turnkey could look into his room at pleasure without coming in. On looking through this place, he saw four or five persons carrying down a rough pine-board coffin. Some one was dead. It struck upon his soul as a mournful presentiment. Alas! he too might soon be thus borne away by rude hands to a neglected grave —unmourned — unmissed. On inquiring, when his turnkey came in, who had died, he found it was his rough persecutor, who had come here voluntarily to live like a gentleman. Poor fellow! he felt glad he had made no return to his taunts. “Did he suffer much?” asked Claude. “No. It was all over in five hours after the first attack.” “What was the matter with him?” The man shook his head slowly, and went out without answering. The next morning but one Claude was again disturbed by the same unusual sound of heavy feet at an early hour. He addressed himself once more to his little keyhole. It was another coffin, resting so weightily on the shoulders of its bearers as to leave no doubt of its contents. A vague suspicion arose in his mind that some pestilence had broken out among the prisoners. When his attendant came in again, he asked him if it were so. “You've hit it,” said the man, nodding his head in the affirmative. “What is it?” asked Claude. “A horrid thing. It strikes you like a bullet—racks you with cramps—turns you blue in the face—and pops you off in short order.” “Is it contagious?” “Rather.” “Are there any sick with it now?” “One. None that has caught it has survived. One of'em is just a-going, I'm afraid; and the worst of it is, the doctors don't understand it, and no one'll go near this poor fellow for fear of catching it. It is the poor little hunchback, you know, that battled the other ones for being cross with you.” “And is he dying so, unattended?” “Yes. What can one do? It's as good as death to go near him, and he is too ill to be removed to the hospital. I think the poor devil don't get his medicine half the time.” “May I go to him?” “You?” said the man, with surprise. “Yes. I will stay with him, if I can be permitted.” The man shrugged his shoulders. “Yes. You've a right to the room, and it will be very good of you; but—” “Let me go, then, at once!” He led the way as he spoke, and Claude again entered the room from which he had escaped with so much pleasure. It presented an appalling appearance. The invalid lay in a corner—livid, and apparently dying. The rest were withdrawn as far as possible. He was, as the man had said, too ill to be removed to the hospital; and they had not yet come to arrange what ought to be done with the others. Gloomy and haggard faces were around. The hardy mirth, which sometimes flourishes in a prison, had disappeared. All was ominously silent. On approaching the patient, Claude found him very low. His head lay in an uneasy position, the pillow having fallen aside. Claude shook and replaced it. A draught of a cooling nature was standing beyond his reach on the floor. “Drink! drink! drink!” said the poor sufferer. “It's death to go near him!” said one of the other prisoners, in a low voice. Claude handed it to him according to the directions. He seemed refreshed by it, and turned his eyes gratefully upon his benefactor. “I'm—most—gone!” he said, with a faint, difficult voice. “Half an hour more!” “My good, kind friend, can I do anything for you?” “Pray! pray!” said the poor fellow, pointing to a book. Claude knelt, and read a prayer selected for the bed of the dying. “I have—a child!” said the man, when he had done, with a stronger effort. “Take her that book! They will tell you down stairs—where—to find her. Say I blessed her—and you—God bless you. Oh! I am cold—” He fell back. Claude gazed upon his face for several minutes. A change came over it, but the spirit passed calmly. He closed the eyes. “To a better world, poor friend!” said Claude. “I will do your bidding, and more, if in my power.” He thought the scarce parted spirit heard him as it left the body. As he descended again to his own room, the poor fellows around bowed to him respectfully. Some of them blessed him. It was a simple tribute to goodness and courage, and he felt how much more brave as well as rational it was to turn even from the grossest insult with patience, and to risk life only in the cause of humanity and virtue. Vol. II.—M In the afternoon the turnkey presented him a bill for dinners of five thalers, stating that he had no more cash on hand, and the restaurateur would supply no more till he was paid. The gross prison fare rose to his memory. He felt already his appetite failing. He was full of pains. He believed he should soon lose his health, and perhaps his life, if obliged to return to a diet so repulsive and so unlike that which habit had rendered necessary. He sat down and wrote to Count Carolan. “Monsieur le Comte, “I have been now in prison two months. I am ill —without money, without food—reduced to the common fare of the unhappy inmates of this mournful dwelling. I have to inform you, also, that a fatal pestilence has broken out in the building, and carried off three victims in two days. I request you, in the name of humanity, to release me. I offer you my word of honour not to leave Berlin without paying you. If your object is to get the money, you can never succeed by keeping me here. If your object is to humble my pride, it is humbled as far as a man's should be. If you desire my life—unless I can breathe the air and take a little exercise, your desire will speedily be gratified. My freedom—if you grant it—I shall employ in honourable labour, of which you shall have the first fruits. Believe me, sir, incapable of falsehood. “I am, Monsieur le Comte, “Your obedient servant, “Claude Wyndham.” It was with the last two groschens he possessed in the world that he despatched the messenger with this note. He felt that in writing it he had not humiliated himself; for he considered Carolan a man whose weak understanding caused his present obduracy more than his bad heart. He had yet to learn how prosperity and pride inflate and harden even the best heart, unless watched over by a sensible mind. The messenger returned in an hour. Claude's heart beat and his hand actually trembled as he perceived that the man had brought an answer. “You found Count Carolan at home, then?” “Yes. He gives a great dinner to-day. His door was surrounded by carriages. Some of the princes were there, and all the diplomatic corps. They told me at first that he could not be troubled with this affair, but I would not go away without an answer. I was determined, sir.” Claude looked at the poor menial. There was kindness in his eye, and his face wore the expression of humanity and commiseration, which, through its rough and not over clean features, made it look even beautiful. “Thank you,” said he; “I am really greatly obliged to you.” “I don't know, sir, but I fear Count Carolan is a hard man when any one offends him. You are not the first he has kept here.” “Well, let us see,” said Claude. “He can but refuse.” The letter ran thus: “Sir, “I have committed the account against you to my lawyer, who has already received his instructions, and I cannot interfere with what now belongs entirely to him. “Yours, etc., “Carolan.” The paper was a thick, gold-edged English sheet. It exhaled a perfume of roses, the wax was sprinkled with gold, and the impression of the seal was the finely-cut arms of the family. “Well!” said Claude, “I thought so. I—I—” He bent his head upon the table. Long confinement had made him nervous and hysterical. He did not shed a tear, but he grew pale and cold as the thought of the wide streets—the moving crowds—the fresh, sunshiny air—the deep, cool woods—the sky —the streams—and all the bright outward world, passed like a vivid panorama through his imagination. The man had gone out and closed the door softly. The poor fellow did not wish to disturb him; and the delicacy and refinement of this lowly heart—almost as much immured here as himself—touched him, and drew the tear which had not flowed at the thought of his own disappointment. At this instant there was a sudden rush against the door, and a loud knocking. It was opened, and Lavalle stood before him. “My friend, my beloved friend!” cried he, and they leaped into each other's arms as if they had been brothers. “I thought—” cried Claude, “I was sure something had kept you.” “I have been in France,” said Lavalle. “To-day is the first time I have heard of it. I have scarcely touched the ground in coming. I overturned a fellow at the door, and expect nothing else than to be put in here with you for assault and battery.” “Who told you?” asked Claude, lifting his face. “Ah, that shall be for another time; but, Dieu! how you are altered! You are scarcely recognisable;” and he gazed at his always handsome face, but which now, by confinement and reflection, had acquired a delicacy, a transparency, and an expression of intellect and refinement rarely seen in a countenance at the same time so firm and manly. He had never before, indeed, remarked how extremely handsome Claude was. His features were so finely formed— his brows pencilled so definitely—his eyes so large and full of soul—and his mouth cut as if by the hand of a sculptor, all showing through a complexion which might have been envied by a woman. Lavalle comprehended, as he gazed on his friend, better than ever, the impression which he suspected he had made on the heart of Ida. “The debt—” said Lavalle. “What is it?” “Fifty pounds.” “And you have been here so long for such a sum? Pay it!—pay it ten times over!' “Generous friend!” said Claude. “But do not be offended. You must do me a much greater favour than what you propose.” “I swear to grant it, whatever it is,” said Lavalle. “You must not pay this debt. I have abased myself before Carolan. I must make him feel his wrong.” “What! vengeance from you? Have you grown wicked in your dungeon?” “No. The vengeance I ask is to be permitted to toil for and pay this myself. You shall get me out by depositing the amount in court as a security for my appearance. You are not afraid I shall run away?” “I'm afraid you won't!” said Lavalle. “Carolan must feel the cruelty, the—” “Stop,” said Lavalle; “he has more excuse than you think. He regards you as the greatest obstacle to his wishes in existence. I have heard a foule of things since my arrival. You know Ida and I are cousins by the mothers. I have always been as a brother. As for love, she knows my views lie elsewhere. The day of the duel, Elkington pressed her to accompany his mother to London, so that on his arrival there, at the proper time, their union might at length take place. Well, what did she reply? She dismissed him with bitter contempt and horror—for ever; she declared his principles were as repulsive to her as his person—that the hand stained with the blood of a duel should never touch hers in friendship again—and she did, somehow or other, come out with the interesting avowal, that you—from the attempts to humiliate you—had risen superior to all your enemies. No one dreamed the little devil had so much spirit; and she sent Elkington M 2 spinning off, in a greater rage than he will get over in a year. So, in revenge, he has carried away with him that rosy-lipped Mary Digby. This fact has confirmed the evil opinion of him which every one already began to entertain, and has so completely convinced a certain lovely young countess that your reported marriage with her was all a fabrication of Elkington, that —but this is, of course, all jest. However, it was she who told me of your situation, and in a way which— why, I'm worse at keeping a secret than a woman!” “Lavalle, spare me!” said Claude. “If you mean to intimate that I am honoured with the esteem of this young girl, I will merit it by my conduct. Never will I approach her. I have had a humiliating lesson. My firmest prayer is, that we may never meet again. But for this debt, I would leave Berlin to-night.” “Do as you please; but what means are you going to take to earn, as you call it, this money? You can't plough or cut wood, can you?" “I can teach English,” said Claude. “You?” “Even I.” “You—the elegant—the flattered—the admired Claude Wyndham—” “Dear Lavalle, your spirits run away with you. Remember I am weak and sad, or, at least, I have been so so long, that even joy is a pain. When shall I be out? I sigh for one breath of sweet, fresh air!” and, in truth, he heaved a deep-drawn sigh. “I shall drive at once to my banker's—to the lawyer's—to the court. If it can be done to-day, it shall. I'm off this very instant—” “But, Lavalle—I am ashamed to tell you—I am actually without food. You have come in time. I am down to my last penning. I have eaten nothing to-day!” “Trust to me,” said Lavalle, tears springing into his eyes. “Trust all to me;” and he dashed off as hastily as he had entered. As Claude looked around upon the naked walls, every crack of which he knew, every web of which he had watched for hours and weeks, he almost feared the last scene had been a dream, so bright, dazzling, and even painful was the sudden prospect of freedom. In half an hour, two waiters, aproned, and bearing an ample and very odoriferous dinner, entered. There was everything that could tempt his palate: two or three kinds of choice wines—segars—silver covers— clean tablecloths and napkins. The table was spread as if for a lord. The waiters desired to know whether they should withdraw, and, upon receiving his answer, they retired. Such a meal is as full of consolation for troubles that are past, as of firm resolutions against future evils. As he was commencing it, the commissioner looked in for something. Claude made him sit down with him and share the welcome feast. The honest fellow ate as he had never eaten before; the delicate viands disappeared with marvellous quickness, and the sparkling Champagne was disposed of without useless ceremonies or unnecessary delay. At the request of Claude, the remains of the feast—and they were ample—were conveyed up stairs to his quondam companions; and in a quarter of an hour the dishes and bottles were brought down in a state which the honest commissioner declared would save the restaurateur the trouble of washing. “Our people up stairs, sir,” said he, “make clean work of it. They don't get Champagne and asparagus every day—poor devils!” Time flew with rapidity. Evening came, and with it the jailer, with an order from the judge. It is probable Lavalle had already taken the necessary measures to procure it before his visit. “I am requested to give you what money you want,” said the director down stairs. He was going to make some magnificent donation to all his fellow-prisoners, if not, in fact, to pay their debts outright, when he remembered that he was lavishing money not his own. He contented himself, therefore, by taking for himself a more moderate sum than he had at first proposed, and ordering certain benevolent favours for the prisoners. The good commissioner was by no means forgotten, but received a donation which he appeared to think a fortune. After a few other donations and arrangements, and changing his loose prison suit for that he usually wore, he once more stepped outside the door of his dismal abode, from which several times he had believed he could never emerge again till carried by careless hands to a neglected grave. Lavalle had sent a horse, which was held by a servant at the door. Claude mounted into the saddle with the feeling of a monarch who is about to return to a kingdom he has saved, at the head of an army he has led to victory. His sensations on riding through the town—on feeling himself again amid moving crowds—on passing the old Schloss—on reaching the Brandenbourg gate, and pushing his horse to a full gallop along the broad, fragrant avenues of the wood, we shall leave to the imagination of the reader; hoping that he may, if possible, often enjoy a pleasure as delightful, without purchasing it with pains as disagreeable as those our hero had suffered. Suffice it to say, he suffered no disagreeable thoughts of business to break upon the sensations of that hour. Again he breathed the fresh air of Heaven; again the calm old trees, streams, and flowers were around him, and no object met his eye without conveying to his soul a sense of pure hope and exquisite pleasure; for if the past was without happiness, it had been also without self-reproach.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XVIII. Lavalle had directed his servant to appoint a meeting with Claude, as soon as he should have finished his ride, at his own lodgings. On arriving there as the cool afternoon shadows began to descend upon the earth, he found the groom waiting for the horse; and he understood the delicacy which had induced Lavalle to leave him the first few hours of his freedom to his own reflections, or rather sensations. He now longed for the meeting with his friend with impatience. There was much which he had to ask. He had been completely cut off from the world. He knew nothing of the great political changes going on around him. He was ignorant of what had occurred in Berlin during his absence. Where was General St. Hillaire? Where was Kühl? He had heard nothing more of him, nor of the fortunate owner of the purse. Not one of all his acquaintances had come to see him, so much had his reputation been injured by the misrepresentations of Elkington—the statements of Carolan—the blow which he had received unresistingly—and his sudden fall from a state of independence to utter poverty. He learned of Lavalle all that he required. General St. Hillaire had been, ever since his imprisonment, ill in bed. Of Kühl Lavalle could state nothing, except that very probably he was ignorant of the fact that Claude was confined. Plans were now arranged for the future. Claude positively refused to accept of the money as a loan, or that he might advance it to Carolan, but that he would wait till he had earned it by his own labour. He had no hope of being able to resume his station in society, and he determined to accommodate himself at once to the new one to which Providence had destined him. He avoided making any inquiry of Ida, and Lavalle did not touch upon that subject, thinking, perhaps, that he had already said more than he had a right to in the hurry of his joy. He promised Claude a class of five every evening, at a thaler an hour; and five at separate hours during the day, also at a thaler, making ten thalers a day, or sixty thalers a week; a princely income for a poor professor of languages; but Lavalle was an able patron, and put a heart into his undertakings which did not allow them to fail. He determined to call on Kühl, and procure also his aid; and they calculated that, in a short time, he could pay his debt to Carolan and the London banker, entirely extricate himself from pecuniary embarrassment, and be in the receipt of a comfortable income till circumstances should offer an occupation more agreeable to his taste. It was decided that he should go into a plain lodging the next day, call in all his bills, and Lavalle would state the prospect of a speedy settlement to the few creditors for their remaining small balance. The next morning, accordingly, Claude found a single plain room, kept by a poor old widow lady, who agreed to board, as well as lodge him, at a moderate price. Lavalle took the watch out of the jailer's hands and bought it himself, allowing for it the sum it originally cost; and undertook himself to superintend all the affairs of his friend, while the latter should devote himself to his new avocations. In less than a week, the whole number of scholars was procured. Mr. Kühl had heard nothing of Claude; and concluding, from his nonappearance, that he had left town for the summer, he made no inquiries after him. He was shocked to learn of his vicissitudes, and delighted to be able to render him any assistance. His whole family entered into his plan, and agreed to become pupils in English; and Claude soon found himself completely established in his new vocation, with the most pleasing prospects of success. His room was plain, but, after his period of probation in the prison, truly comfortable. The furniture was ordinary, but neat. The good woman supplied his meals in the house; but finding that it would be more convenient for her, as well as less expensive for himself, he offered to eat at the same table with her, and he requested her to make no change in her usual fare, except in the addition of the quantity necessary for another person. Poor Claude was now, from necessity, excluded from the society where he had before been received with so much attention; and, had this not been the case, he would by no means have sought it. There were not wanting several—and they the most cultivated and distinguished people—whom, had a selection been in his power, he would, from the first, have chosen for his friends; who seemed to take a kind of interest in him, inspired partly by his history as recounted by Lavalle, and partly by his personal manners and character. The incident of the purse of gold and his refusing the reward, at the moment when he had just heard of his ruin, had been everywhere related by Mr. Kühl, and had reached royal ears. Expressions of admiration had been repeated from lips whose opinions were not likely to be gainsaid; and his character as an honest man was made apparent, and was growing every day more so. His presence in Berlin, his lowly occupation, his unintermitting industry, and the nature of the employment he had adopted, brought him in contact with many people, who were struck with the modesty and yet quiet dignity of his manners, the plainness of his dress, and the punctuality and cheerful conscientiousness which he put into his labours. There was a general harmony and consistency in his life, which spoke for him against calumny; and the mild yet steady firmness with which he met, when accidentally they crossed his path, those whom he had once known on terms of equality, and who knew he had not only descended from the rank in which he had first appeared, but had unresistingly received a blow rather than fight a duel, engaged their respect and altered their unfavourable opinion of him. Rumours, too, of the assassin who had twice attempted his life, had awakened all the watchfulness of the police, and was now generally and implicitly believed, although at first doubted. This threw a new sympathy around Claude, and produced another curious effect. The character of Elkington had begun to be whispered about; his affair with the officer—his exposure at cards—the displeasure of his father, etc. The fierce brutality with which he had conducted himself in the quarrel with Denham began now to be more coolly canvassed, even by those who at first thought it excusable. Although, in the interview with his mother, where his passions, roused to their highest fury by her narrative and the dangers impending over him, he had so far forgotten himself as to inflict a blow upon the author of his being; although, during that interview, the outer doors had been locked and doubly locked, the incident had transpired, the occurrence was reported and credited. Indeed, anything would have been credited of Elkington; and now the attempts upon Claude's life were laid to his charge. It is thus that such a character at length becomes an object of universal distrust and suspicion. It had been before stated in the journals—but Claude, in his prison, knew nothing of it—that the death of the Earl of Beverly had been announced pematurely. He had fallen into a fit from which no human skill could save him, and it was improbable that he could ever have the use of his senses again, at least until the moment of his death. Elkington therefore remained longer in a state of suspense, and had gone to London with his mother. The Digbys had also gone. Nothing more had been heard of them in Berlin, or of their unfortunate daughter. Under these circumstances, Claude began to be regarded as at least an honest man, and a man of principle. All who had dealings with him acknowledged even that, when they were not paid, he had made every possible sacrifice to satisfy their demands. His very presence in the streets, where he might be occasionally seen passing to and from the various houses of his pupils, was an answer to the principal charges against him. His hard labour—his self-deprivation of all the luxuries and amusements of life—the simple and even rude dress which he now wore, if without pride, at least without shame—and the constant friendship and praises of Lavalle, were all in his favour. He was not unfrequently invited, poor and unfashionable as he now was, to dine at the tables of Monsieur de N— and General St. Hillaire, as well as two or three others, who believed him to have made the great sacrifice of his passions and his reputation as a man of courage—that treasure which an honourable mind would purchase with life—to a conscientious principle of action. These invitations he however declined, from a feeling that the poor and those in debt should indulge in no pleasures which might lead to the slightest expense. Besides, satisfied with the purity of his actions, he shrank from the attention which they excited; and his life, in the midst of a great city, surrounded by moving armies and a glittering court, was almost as solitary and simple as that of Robinson Crusoe in his island. He had steeled his heart to meet the world; and, strange to say, notwithstanding his fall, he was happier than before. He seemed to have regained his independence. Occupation gave him wholesome spirits. The direction of his energies to a single purpose excluded weak reveries and idle apprehensions from his mind. He thought of Ida sometimes, but it was as one dead. Respecting her sentiments towards him he was still uncertain. It had happened two or three times that she had seen him in the street: sometimes when he was walking alone, thoughtful and sad, in the Park, sometimes hastening along the street to his daily toils. He could not but remember that at Monsieur de N—'s, the last time they had met in society, when he sought her eye, she turned away, as if unwilling to address him. He knew this was an act of obedience to an arbitrary father, Vol. II.—N but it was enough to keep him from intruding upon her again, even with a look; and on the occasions of these accidental encounters, he cast his eyes to the ground with an humble pride, of which he could not know the effect upon this young girl. Often, in his walks, too, he met the various persons of the societé; and, although at first it pained him, after a little time he was only amused to see the unfeelingness with which some met him. At first he had, from an unpremeditated sense of courtesy, bowed to the still happy acquaintances of his former hours. But so many among them discovered a disinclination to receive even a passing recognition, that he determined to address no one first. Some had bowed in return, but hastened by as if afraid to be addressed by him; some returned his salutation with a stately air of superiority; some replied with an inclination so slight and cool, and a look so soon averted, as to indicate plainly how offensive they found the impertinence of recognising them; while others, with an ostentatious care, dropped their eyes to the ground, lifted them to the sky, or turned them away till he had passed. There were not wanting some who stared in his face, without thinking it necessary to use ceremony in gratifying their curiosity, but who, on his civil bow on meeting their glances, only opened their eyes and mouths a little wider, and, with a steady gaze of astonishment, suffered his courtesy to remain unanswered, or to be replied to exactly as would have been the case had they been unexpectedly addressed by an entire stranger. It would be paying a poor compliment to these gay circles to say that the class we have described formed the majority. Often he was stopped by the gentle, the cultivated, and the refined, with kind and affable inquiries after his health and prospects. Some distinguished him thus in his altered fortunes with more marks of respect than they had bestowed before. And there were ladies—young and old—who, by the simplest acts of affability, meeting him with exactly the same charming familiarity with which they had always greeted him, appeared to his grateful and impressionable mind in such a fair light—the old so good, the young so graceful and lovely—that surely, had the proud, the conceited, and the narrow-minded known how strong a feeling of admiration could be produced by such simple sacrifices, there would have been no superciliousness and arrogance among them; if not natural sweetness of character, good sense would have made them less pretending. But there are people who have neither. If the limits of the story would permit, we could find materials for a goodly volume in the experience of our hero from the receipt of the fatal letter withdrawing his income, to that when he found himself the possessor of sufficient money to discharge the amount of Carolan's debt, as well as all else that he owed in the world. There are two or three episodes narrated at large, and an edifying succession in the manuscript of the king's library, from which this history is drawn, which it would gratify us to lay before the reader, did time and space permit. One refers to the illness of a little boy, the son of the poor old lady with whom Claude boarded, and who, being ill of a contagious disorder, was attended in person by Claude, at the peril of his life and against the warnings of the physician. The poor little fellow, notwithstanding this service, died; and a part of Claude's earnings were appropriated to paying the mournful expenses attending the committal of his sweet little body to the earth. The old lady knew no one to tell this to. The doctor said the gentleman was a fool, and always spoke of him as such, without always giving the reasons on which that flattering epithet was founded. Claude himself was not in the habit of making his own acts the topic of conversation, and therefore this affair was never known till the doctor one day, on finding that Claude had employed a more eminent physician, let it out in revenge, and to ruin his character as a man of sense. Another of these episodes describes how old Mr. Kühl had a daughter, Mademoiselle Kühl—how she was about eighteen years of age—that her charms of person were equalled only by her heart and mind— and how she spent so much time in studying the irregular verbs, adjectives, and conjunctions of the English tongue, under the tutelage of her handsome and melancholy young professor, that, before she was aware of the progress she was making, she found she had acquired a considerable knowledge upon other subjects besides syntax and prosody. She grew so reserved and cool to Mr. Wyndham, that that young gentleman, entirely engaged with his grammars and dictionary, concluded she had taken offence against him. With a simplicity rather violent in a youth who, however fond of rural beauty, had not spent all his life in the country, he addressed old Mr. Kühl upon the subject, and was made to open his very interesting eyes wider than he had done for some time by a frank explanation of the sudden cause from Kühl, and an offer of a furnished house in the Linden, near the Thiergarten—a banker would hold payable to his order the sum of 100,000 thalers, Prussian money — and the young lady herself, with a pair of eyes as full of tenderness as a star is of light; and all these on no more difficult a condition than the utterance of the little monosyllable “Yes.” But that word, short and easy as it may be, is often the source of profound consequences, and is often found the most difficult, and sometimes, also, the most dangerous in the dictionary. Claude was astonished at the proposal of this offer, but his astonishment was not greater than that of Mr. Kühl upon hearing him respectfully but firmly decline it. “What! zounds! hey! refuse a fortune of 100,000 thalers, with such a girl as my Emily! and you scarcely out of prison? Refuse my Emily? what! hey!” “My esteemed friend,” said Claude, with a delicacy and tact which his kind patron perfectly understood and deeply felt, “I can never refuse what the young lady has herself never offered, and perhaps would not sanction; but I may tell you, in confidence, that long before I knew you—I—I—” “Ah, keh!” said the old gentleman. “It is so—is it? Well—I—she—we had better say no more about it.” “I may add,” said Claude, “that even when I commenced with your family, their knowledge of English was so good that they scarcely required my services; and now they are almost in a state to teach it themselves. Let me therefore withdraw as a tutor, and meet you and them hereafter only as a friend. I have already more than I can attend to, for I believe everybody in Berlin has undertaken to learn English.” “Be it so,” said Mr. Kühl. “I should feel awkward in my present position with any other person,” added he, gravely, and with some confusion; “but you—in every breath, in every glance—are a man of honour; a man,” he added, with some feeling, “whom a father can trust with the sacredest secret of his daughter's soul.” The manuscript goes on to say, that for a period Claude continued his visits to the house, but they gradually grew fewer and farther between, and at length entirely ceased. The third circumstance, which, however useful it would be in swelling our history to the required size, had we not on hand “metal more attractive,” is the conduct of Monsieur Rossi. He recovered, and resumed his toils as a French teacher; but he was pale, melancholy, and distrait. He lived almost on the bounty of Claude. His manner was strange and unsocial. He exhibited no gratitude for the favours he had received and was daily receiving; but demanded more money as if of his banker. Claude tried to sooth him into some kind of companionship, but his efforts were fruitless. He was taciturn and gloomy in society. When they met in the street, this singular being often avoided him. In all cases of want, however, he N 2 did not hesitate to seek him and solicit his aid, and to coolly apply the gratuity to luxuries which the giver denied to himself. With a spirit which a blow had irritated to madness, he did not hesitate to live on the charity of another, and to spend in selfish follies his friend's hard-earned gains. Claude at length perceived that he was not, after all, an object of real merit, and one day he frankly refused to give him money. His demeanour on the occasion was cold, ungrateful, and mean. He at first begged, and then knelt down and implored for a few thalers. Disgusted and astonished, Claude refused positively, and told him to seek elsewhere his living hereafter. He offered to exert himself, if he wished, to procure him scholars, but not to give him the means of living in idleness and intemperance. He told him he had just enough to pay his debts, and that he was now about to pay Carolan. “Ah, oh!” said Rossi. “You remember, perhaps, what I told you about Ida. It was a lie. It was all my own fabrication.” “Be it so,” said Claude. “I did not speak of it.” “But you think of it often,” said Rossi. “I am not blind. I have seen you—in the night even—lingering by her house.” “Do you dog my steps, sir?” said Claude, sternly. “Yes—yours and hers,” said Rossi. “Many an hour I have watched you both unseen, undreamed of. She must not suppose I have forgotten the vile blow I received in her presence and on her account, and that she touched afterward, in friendship, the hand that struck me. As for you, sir—what if she does love you? what if she has been ill—to death almost? what if her health is gone—her beauty fading—her heart heavy—her eyes, even, full of misery? Does she think I pity her? Not a bit. I gloat on these signs of despair!” “Rossi,” said Claude, “what madness is this? Who told you the Countess Ida was ill?” “My own eyes—my own heart; and not only that she is ill, but that she is ill for—you. And you, who have stolen her from me—you deny me the poor means to live! Look to it! you and she too. I have waited and waited, and paused and paused! I have been by her in hours when she thought herself alone—in the day—in the night—in the crowd—in solitude—watching—gazing—Weak fool! the scene must close. The fire is lighted on the altar—the high-priest attends— the victim is bound. Look to it! sir!” He stamped his foot fiercely. His features were pale and haggard, his eye flashed with a fearful expression, and he withdrew, slamming the door violently after him. This conduct confirmed a suspicion, which had glanced across Claude's mind before, that the poor being had moments of insanity, and to that he ascribed the vague threats which he uttered; but whether they were directed against himself or Ida, he could not tell. At length, however, the money was in his hand to pay the demand of Carolan, who, through his lawyer, had demanded the highest rate of interest, and all the costs of the suit and his imprisonment. The other debts were already paid. He accordingly met the lawyer and paid the judgment. It was on a pleasant morning in the latter part of the summer that he set off to demand a personal interview with Carolan, the last, richest, and hardest of his creditors. It was his intention to ask of Carolan a retraction of the suspicions he had expressed against him. He went, therefore, to his magnificent palace, from which he was now excluded as an inferior being. He was much altered by the constant labours, events, and feelings of the last few months. His health was enfeebled. His cheeks were pale and thin, and his once smooth face showed lines of care and sorrow. Poverty, which did not break his spirit, had worn upon his body. The thought of debt had caused him many a bitter day and sleepless night. It seemed even as if he were sinking gradually into the grave; a fact of which, by the sadness on his brow, he might have been conscious. His clothes, too, were poor and faded. The money necessary to dress himself better, he had, even from his slender earnings, bestowed on Rossi, or the little boy who had perished from the earth like an early flower, and whom he had ardently loved. He had sent some, also, to his banker, to be paid to Mrs. Denham, without receiving any answer from or news of her; and the resolution to pay all his debts before Carolan's demand had obliged him to spend nothing on his own person. As he approached the palace of Carolan there was about it an air of grandeur which contrasted singularly with his own humble sphere. Two or three serving men in livery were lounging at the door, and several equipages were drawn up in front—the panels glittering with the ostentatious arms of the owners; the chasseurs, in their gorgeous dresses, lounging about; and the coachmen asleep on their boxes, exhausted with late hours and hard work. As he entered the hall, the servants did not move from their careless attitudes—the very men who once, at the sight of him, sprung up with the violent respect they were taught to pay alone to the rich and great. Cards were an expense he had long laid aside, and he had written his name on a piece of paper. “Well,” said one of the men, with a round face and goggle eyes, and bursting with good feed and lazy living, “what do you want?” “To see Monsieur le Comte Carolan.” “I don't think it likely you'll succeed in doing that at present,” replied the man, taking the paper unceremoniously from his hand, and looking at him from head to foot. “Monsieur le Comte is engaged; you'd better call to-morrow.” “Do me the favour to take my name in,” said Claude. “Why, monsieur, he is with company now; and as he goes to France the day after to-morrow, he has no time to lose. Hadn't you better leave your business with me?” “To France? With his family?” “Ay, with Mademoiselle Ida.” “With Mademoiselle Ida?” Claude's heart felt an old twinge of a malady which he had striven hard to overcome. “I must see him, then, to-day, and I will only pay it into his own hands.” “Well, if the man insists on it,” said the other footman, “you'd better let him go into the study and wait. I'll take your name, monsieur. Walk up into the study.” The two men mounted the broad flight of steps, whose velvet carpet felt strange beneath his feet. One went in with the name. The other passed through three or four of the spacious and gorgeous rooms into a smaller and most exquisitely furnished cabinet, the walls clothed with richly-bound books and priceless paintings, and full of all the thousand elegances and luxuries of the rich and great. He sat down on a chair in the embrasure of one of the windows, half concealed by stands of flowers, curtains, and statues. He had not been there a minute when a step was heard. The door opened, and Ida entered. Claude did not move either to conceal or reveal himself, but he perceived at once she did not see him, and was not aware that any one was present. She passed to a bookcase and took out a book. Her face was pale and sad. She was not at all the same careless and happy girl whom he had seen in the portrait. The time which had passed over her had left its marks, and she was really changed. Yet, as he gazed again, with a rapture that almost suspended his being, he thought her more beautiful than ever. There was in her countenance more thought and character. It had that sweetness which patient grief gives, and which Raphael has portrayed with such an inspired hand. Claude could not wholly exclude the idea that the changes in her face might have been occasioned partly by him. The fervour of his own love rose again in his bosom; and to have thrown himself at her feet, and said one farewell, he would have consented to die the same hour. But he restrained himself. He remembered his promise, his duty, and her happiness, and he sat silent. She was passing out again with the book she had taken down, when, by some strange chance, she returned to look at a tuberose, recently brought in, which she had not seen before. The flower, with a number of others, stood on a large stand between her and himself, and had hitherto prevented her seeing him. As she advanced, he rose. His eyes were bent to the ground, his face was pale. He scarcely knew whether he felt more pain or pleasure, and he could not repress or hide his agitation. She knew him instantly; but at the sight of him—his pale, thin face, his mean clothes, his dusty boots, and all the apparel of poverty—a half-uttered shriek and shudder escaped her, and she sank into a chair covering her face with her hands. Yes! it was love—ingenuous, artless love—unused to the womanly power of concealment; and the deep crimson which succeeded the pallor of her forehead and neck, and all that those trembling and beautiful hands sought in vain to hide, taught her as well as him, that, without words, the sacred secret of her soul was betrayed. It seems that, with the innate dignity and purity of her nature, she recovered her self-possession almost instantly, for she rose and said, extending her hand frankly, “Mr. Wyndham—you have been so long absent— you—you are so greatly altered—that the sight of you startled me.” “Let me hope,” said Claude, and once more she listened to the tones of a voice so much loved, so long unheard, and now touched with a tremour that betrayed irresistible agitation, “that neither my absence, nor anything that has occurred during it, has deprived me of the—esteem—of—of—so valued a friend.” It was mutually clear to both the lovers—for so we trust the sagacious reader has long since found them —that this accidental meeting was to be reduced as soon as possible from the tone of high feeling which it had first awakened, to the safer and less embarrassing courtesy of ordinary society. Both wished it, and both intuitively felt the delicacy and propriety which demanded it. “Indeed, Mr. Wyndham, I should do myself but poor justice if I did not say how clearly I have perceived the propriety of your conduct, and how little I have shared the errors of others respecting you.” “You make me happy,” said Claude; and with a deeper fervour, which he could not repress, and perhaps was not aware of, he added, “The approbation of such as you is all I dare hope; and yours—is all I desire.” “We are about visiting France!” said Ida, somewhat hastily. “My father, in doing so, acts against the advice of all his friends; but he is very firm in his determinations. My uncle, Colonel St. Marie, proposed to leave Paris; but my father is hastening there to prevent him, and has offered to aid him in the cause of the king. The strange revolution going on there my father thinks will be put down very soon; and he is willing, if his majesty wishes, to enter into his service. You know he spent his youth in the army.” “It is a very dangerous journey,” said Claude. “But he expects a high office from the king—and is determined to go immediately.” “We shall not see you again, then!” said Claude. “No; and I am very fortunate in this opportunity to bid you farewell. My father will be disengaged, I believe, in a moment.” She held out her hand. “I wish you all happiness, Mr. Wyndham.” This was the weak moment which Claude had scarcely the strength to resist. He took the hand extended to him. He attempted to speak, but after the first word his utterance failed. To have indicated by the slightest pressure of that hand the feelings of his bosom—to have expressed with a gesture what words refused to utter—to have raised those soft fingers to his lips, as they yet lingered in his, were the impulses of his soul. But he was one of those men who had learned to govern himself, to make sacrifices, to resist impulses, and to act with honour in all the most minute and secret affairs of life. He dropped the hand almost coldly; but all his prudence could not prevent the thought which swelled his heart from finding utterance, “Is it for ever—?” Her eyes met his, and she replied, “It is for ever.” There was a step. She was gone; and he rose and hastily dashed the drops from his eyes, to meet the conceited and unrelenting father of the being whom he now loved with more fervour than ever, and who was to bless his eyes no more. “Well, sir,” said Carolan, sitting down by a table, without asking his visiter to follow his example, “what procures me the honour of this visit?” “Count Carolan,” said Claude, advancing quietly, and even respectfully, to the table, for he had now not even the desire to retaliate the rudeness of this weak man, “I have come to state to you that the sum for which you imprisoned me is paid.” “I have no time myself to arrange these affairs with you, but my lawyer will.” “No, monsieur, it is already arranged; but I wish, before separating from you, without the probability of our ever meeting again, to inform you, that the debts which, by a very peculiar accident, I found myself unable to pay in the commencement of the summer, are now all discharged; not by any arrangement or any accident, but by the results of my personal labour.” “I have nothing to do with all this, sir. It may be true or not. I have neither the time nor the inclination to inquire, as your character and yourself are equally indifferent to me.” “Could no proof make you publicly unsay, at least, that part of the aspersions which I learn you have cast on my honesty in pecuniary matters?” “I know nothing of you or your affairs, sir; and I wish to know nothing of them. When a man has deceived me once, I find it quite enough. My hospitality is sometimes abused by persons whom I take up on too slight grounds—” “Take up! Count Carolan.” “But I am a little too well read in human nature to suffer myself to be betrayed twice by the same person; one of the servants will show you out, sir; and, our mutual affairs being now settled, I hope—” He rose and rang the bell. “Adieu, sir,” said Claude; “if I thought you capable of distinguishing between right and wrong, I would ask you to reflect hereafter that you have refused to do justice to the character which you have proofs is free from reproach, and that you have not thought it unworthy of your courage to insult a person who mildly claimed your good opinion, and whom you know to be without the defence usually possessed by gentlemen under the same circumstances.” “I can't remain listening to you, sir, all day; and you will excuse me—” They were interrupted by a loud shriek. It was sudden and piercing, and announced extreme terror. It was followed by a confusion of various noises, an opening of doors, a treading of feet, and several voices calling out. “What can that be?” said the count, his pompous manner leaving him entirely; and they both hastened out, Claude as much agitated as he, for he thought he recognised the voice which had uttered the scream as Ida's. They ran across two or three rooms, which seemed to their eager suspense interminable, and reached, at length, the large hall used sometimes as a dining and sometimes as a ball room. At the farther end a sight met their view which wellnigh deprived them of the power of motion. Ida, her hands Vol. II.—O extended, her face struck with terror, stood shrinking from the fury of a stranger, apparently in a delirium of rage and revenge. He held a large pistol in each hand, of which one was presented at the breast of the fainting girl. The servants, called by her shrieks, had crowded the doors; but as the maniac—for it was Rossi, in a fearful paroxysm of insanity—turned his dreadful eye and levelled weapon upon them, they crowded and shrunk back with hasty terror. Never was a more frightful object than the unhappy young man at this moment. His livid face wore the hideous grin of a lunatic. His thick hair was wild about his head. He mowed and chattered to himself, and pointed first his long finger and then the pistol at the terrified being whose charms had driven his senses awreck. At the same time, he made wry faces, sometimes at her, and sometimes at beings who seemed to be hovering around him in the air; and his motions were so sudden and fantastic, that no one could have seen him thus abandoned to all the ecstasy of madness, even in chains, without horror and fear. But now, thus armed, all gave up Ida as lost. It was a moment of most intense and agonizing expectation, and the wretched being went on mowing and chattering to himself till the foam stood upon his lips. “Rossi,” said Claude, advancing upon him cautiously, while Carolan stood petrified in motionless despair. The terrible intruder turned at the sound of his voice, and laughed till the hall echoed again. “Ah ha!” said he, “where is Elkington now? He struck me once—oh God—the dog! the reptile! But the sacrifice is prepared! Why does he not come to claim his wife?” “Rossi, my kind friend,” said Claude, in a soothing voice, but one which trembled with horror, lest, ere he could succeed in grasping him, he might fire upon the sweet girl, upon whose bloody sacrifice he seemed so determined. “What!” cried Rossi, “you will come forward? Stir an inch—stir one hair's breadth, and she dies!” and he levelled both his pistols at Ida. Carolan started to rush forward, but Rossi extended his arm with a gesture which arrested at once the advance of the agonized father. “Keep his attention this way,” said Claude to Carolan, in a low tone, “and I will secure him!” “I will,” murmured Carolan, shaking in every limb; “I will, I will. Here you have not the courage to look at me, you foul madman,” he continued. “Not the courage?” echoed Rossi; and he darted upon Carolan, but suddenly he stopped. With the shrewdness of a madman, he suspected a connivance, and he turned to look for Claude. He perceived him now fairly in the middle of the floor, alone, and completely between him and Ida. At this sight his fury seemed lashed into new delirium. He stamped his foot and exclaimed, “Stand aside! You canting, ignominious fool, stand aside! Will you too fall? Away. I am going to fire. The hour—the instant has come. I have gloated for months on this moment. At length it is here. Leave her to her fate.” Claude stood back before Ida. Had he advanced to seize him, he could have fired at her by changing his position. His only hope was to shield her with his person, even if it could be done only by receiving the ball in his own body. He placed himself, therefore, before her in such a way as to protect her entirely from danger. “No, no,” cried Ida, convulsively; “noble! generous! no, no—” But, as she spoke, Rossi fired, and the ball lodged in the wall within an inch of Claude's head. “Step aside, I say, reptile!” howled the maniac again, advancing with the other pistol drawn, and gnashing his teeth with fiendish rage; but Claude stood firm, lifted his tall figure so as to shield completely the form of Ida, and fixed his eye steadily on his adversary, who advanced so near as to make the destruction of one of his intended victims almost certain. He had approached to within two or three yards, and was in the act of pulling the trigger, when Ida fainted and fell heavily upon Claude's arm, who stamped his foot suddenly, and exclaimed, “Fire,” and at the same time rushed forward with his burden in such a way as to throw the maniac from his aim. He started, and at the same moment the pistol was discharged. A shriek of horror burst from all the household who had assembled to witness this frightful scene. The ball again buried itself in a splendid door at a still greater distance from its intended objects. Carolan himself, accompanied by twenty servants, now leaped upon the unfortunate wretch, who, in the impotence of his fury, had dashed the heavy butt of the pistol into his own head with a force which wounded him dangerously. All was now confusion. Claude committed the senseless form of the fair girl he had saved at such imminent risk to the arms of her trembling father; who, as often happens with men of feeble understanding, had been so bewildered and stunned by the greatness of the danger, that, whatever might have been his courage, he did not know what to do. Had he advanced, he believed it would only have been to behold his daughter murdered long before he could reach her or the assassin. A confusion of joy now took place of the despair which had, till the securing of Rossi, filled every mind. Claude was the object of universal admiration. In the dangerous crisis in which he found himself, he had exhibited a self-possession and courage which surprised everybody, and which alone had saved the life of Ida. That he had ever been suspected of cowardice was now a matter of astonishment; and it was acceded that few men would have so calmly faced almost certain death. The idea that he had suffered a blow rather than fight a duel now received a kind of interest, which raised him to a rank above that of a merely brave man. Simple bodily courage is by no means a rare gift; and, when possessed without moral courage, does not entitle a man to the high standing which he sometimes claims on account of it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XIX. Ida had no sooner been safely conveyed to her apartment, than Carolan returned to seek Claude, with an embarrassment which he could scarcely conceal. He had not an understanding sufficiently enlarged to teach him how to act on such an occasion; and the dictates of his heart, however naturally good, had so long been subservient to his vanity, that it had ceased to serve him as a useful guide. He thanked the preserver of his daughter with a gratitude which was not free from condescension; and, in acknowledging the debt, he showed that he wished it had not been incurred. He had neither learned to forgive nor to ask forgiveness; graces which belong only to sense and feeling. On the day after this event Ida had quite recovered from the effects of her fright, and Carolan sent a servant to Claude's humble lodging to say she would be happy to see and thank her preserver. The note was couched in terms of cold pride, in which the inflated character of the count was easily visible. Claude was carefully informed that the meeting was at the request of the count himself. Without taking umbrage at the eccentric weakness of a character in which he felt little interest, on the next day he repaired to Carolan's house at the appointed hour. The count met him in the study. He wished his daughter, he said, to thank him for her deliverance, as he did himself, with a stately gratitude and an offer of his purse to any amount. O 2 “After the great service you have rendered me,” said he, “I will freely supply your pecuniary wants to any extent. You may call upon my banker during my absence in France, whither a high public duty calls me. My daughter is weak, and I trust you will not trespass too much—” “Were it left to my choice,” said Claude, “I should prefer not to oppress her with the useless task of returning thanks, which you consider so requisite.” “You will permit me to say this is at your request?” asked the count. “Certainly.” His brow cleared up. “Well, then, be it so; to say the truth, she is not well, and we start early to-morrow morning. Such men as I are demanded by the perilous state of affairs in France, where all the chivalry and talent of Europe ought to concentrate itself; and I deem it proper —as well due to myself as from an imperative sense of duty to his gracious majesty the King of France, and, indeed, to the cause of royalty over the world—to offer my poor talents, such as they are. I believe the cause will not be lighter for my attaching myself to it. A high consciousness of the manner in which I have performed all my duties, makes me hope that I shall not be an unacceptable accession to his majesty's strength. It would afford me pleasure to ask you to drive with me to-day; but Prince L—has begged to come, and—” “It would be impossible for me to avail myself of your politeness,” said Claude, his feelings towards the daughter scarcely enabling him to preserve a decent exterior of respect before the father. “Then, Mr. Wyndham, adieu; and if, as I trust I may hope, you deem my friendship worth accepting”— he held out his fore finger for Claude to shake— “it may be a pleasure for you to know that you have it. I am going out—shall I set you down?” Claude declined the offer, bowed, and, without receiving the fore finger so condescendingly offered, took his leave. The next day the Carolans took their departure for France. In the mean time, the town rang with the gallantry of the action he had performed, and he suddenly became a kind of lion. This ill suited his simple habits, and he withdrew from attentions which he did not greatly value, and could not accept without embarrassment from his limited pecuniary means. Poor Rossi had been taken from Carolan's to the asylum, where, in a week, although everything possible was done for him, and Claude visited him every day, he died. With him a strange life was closed—endured without profit to himself or others—a mind undisciplined—a heart not cultivated properly—passions without restraint or religion to govern them. His weak understanding had been rendered weaker by the want of education and moral principle; and to such a being the world is so full of dangers and pains—to be incurred without support, or endured without recompense—that even pity could scarcely sigh over his early grave. It was observed, in his last ravings, that the prominent incident in his imagination was the blow he had received from Elkington. He fancied it had left a festering spot upon his forehead—that the disgrace was one which could be washed out, not by a life of equal courage and simple virtue, but by revenging himself on Elkington, either by the sacrifice of himself or some one dear to him. “There must be blood,” thought the poor maniac, “ere I shall be able to recover from the humiliation.” Claude witnessed his closing scene with many serious reflections; and he was startled to remember what similar thoughts of blind revenge and reckless passion had filled his own mind the night when he himself had been struck by Elkington. He too had been tainted with the Gothic idea that anything could stain an immortal soul but its own evil passions, and that it was permitted one weak human being to solace his own rage by shedding the blood of another. He too had thought of a duel—of self-destruction—of murder—of madness. But his calmer nature had recovered itself amid its communings with the elements, had listened to the voice of God in the air, and seen his lessons in the heaven. Thus the master of himself, he turned from the temptations of the world; and, depending on his Creator alone, trod the painful path of right with the hisses of all around him ringing in his ears.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XX. It was a curious coincidence in this passage of the life of Wyndham, that Rossi was scarcely dead when a message from Carl, his quondam domestic, earnestly prayed his presence at the criminal prison, where, confined after having been convicted of murder, he was awaiting execution. Absorbed in other affairs, and partly in consequence of the silence and privacy with which such matters are conducted in Prussia, Claude had received no intelligence of this till a note from Carl made him acquainted with his dreadful situation. He immediately complied with his request, and was admitted to the convict's cell. It was with difficulty that he recognised him, so much was he altered by confinement and agony of mind. He was pale and haggard. His manner had lost all its gayety, and he seemed several years older than before. “It is so good of monsieur to come,” said he, on seeing Claude. “I want, before I quit the world, to ask your pardon for the injury I have done you.” “I grant it, most sincerely,” said Claude. “I have been a bad fellow, monsieur; but I have repented, and I die with a full faith in our blessed Redeemer. I am content to die. I deserve it.” “Can nothing be done to commute your punishment?” asked Claude. “No, monsieur. All has been done that was possible. My father and mother are both here. They have sought mercy of his majesty, but he has not thought proper to accord it; and yet my crime was not without provocation. You have doubtless heard what goaded me on to kill this man for whose death I am to be punished?” “No, I have not heard it.” “He was my master, and a very bad, brutal man. He was not a good master as you were, but he was always scolding me. One day he called me so many names that I could not prevent myself replying, and I told him no gentleman would use such terms to his servant. He instantly struck me—and I have never yet submitted to a blow with patience—I strove to strike him back, but he was too strong for me. I asked him if he dared to meet me in the field—for I was born, sir, in a much higher station than a domestic—but he only laughed at me. I went to complain to the police. He declared I had offered to strike him first, and the police dismissed my complaint. What was I to do? Where was I to seek redress? I had often sworn that no one should ever strike me without my being revenged. I had heard many others swear the same. A blow I could not bear; and finding all other modes of righting myself in vain, I killed him with an axe, set the house on fire, and fled. I was pursued, overtaken, tried, condemned, and am now waiting the day of my execution. They say nothing can save me. But I have repented of my crime, and am resigned to my fate.” “Can I do anything for you?” said Claude, shocked almost beyond the power of speech by this scene. “Grant me your pardon. It is all I ask. Besides the wickedness you detected me in, I have committed many others. I have often robbed you of trifling things, such as I thought you would never miss. I often neglected your commands, and told you I had obeyed you when I had not. Lord Elkington and Lady Beverly are very bad people; and they paid me to tell all I could find out about you. But I have partially repaired my crime against you, as Madame Wharton will tell you. I could communicate a great secret, but she made me promise not to do so, and I shall not die with a lie on my lips. You can do nothing else for me, unless, indeed, to be present at the last moment. Promise me you will be there. I shall feel a consolation in thinking there is one person who regards me with mercy and pity.” “I promise,” said Claude; “and, in the mean time, beg you will let me do all that is possible to alleviate your situation.” “No, no, I do not wish to see you again. I have done with earthly things, and must prepare for—for— hereafter.” He turned pale, and added, “Ah, Mr. Wyndham, had I but been an honest man, and served you faithfully, how different would now be my situation!” A priest here came in; and, as Claude withdrew, the poor fellow clasped his hand and kissed it earnestly. “Adieu—for ever. May you be happy—and you will be. Remember the words of a dying man.” Claude left the prison much impressed in favour of Carl, who seemed to have been unprincipled more from the want of reflection than innate hardness of heart. It was about one month after this interview that the announcement of an execution caused a sensation of lively horror throughout Berlin, where these frightful spectacles were rarely seen. According to his promise, Claude resolved to be present. It was on a magnificent day in July that he went forth, at three o'clock in the morning, to behold the unnatural ceremony of depriving a human being of that life which has been bestowed by the hand of God. The scene of this bloody operation was just on the outside of one of the city gates, on a wide, level sand-plain. The morning was one of those when the earth, air, and heaven wear a more than usually resplendent aspect. The sky was without a cloud. The pale moon was seen declining in the west, and the sun had just risen with a brilliancy that promised great heat during the day. The air was fresh and cool, and the breeze, here and there wafted over a dewy garden, came full of delicious odours. There was a stir perceptible over the whole town as soon as he issued from his door, and groups of persons might be seen stepping along, with marks of haste in their air and countenance; as he continued on his way the number increased, and carriages, carts, wagons, and droskies occasionally rattled by, till at length, turning into the long, narrow street which led to the gate on the outside of which the execution was to take place, he found a dense throng walking with a rapid pace all in the same direction; and the street was crowded with vehicles, of which the occupants, as well as the thousands of pedestrians, were, almost without exception, talking together with loud, gay voices, some jesting and laughing, some singing and shouting, and a few here and there brandishing bottles or huge sausages, which furnished their morning meal, and which was devoured with an hilarious mirth strangely contrasted with the solemn spectacle they were hastening to witness. Half an hour's walk, through a multitude every instant growing more dense, on the whole well behaved, and composed in a considerable proportion of women and children, brought Claude through the gate and along one of the suburbs to a road leading into a vast, open field of heavy sand, in a corner of which a black mass of human beings—swarming like a cluster of bees around three dark, massive columns of brick, placed in the form of a triangle, immediately behind a broad platform, also built of brick, and surrounded by an iron balustrade—announced the fatal point of attraction. On either side of the scaffold, at the distance of fifty or sixty yards, were several small, natural elevations of ground, on one of which, and fronting the dreadful stage where the dire act was so soon to be performed, Claude took his stand. He could perceive a few paces from him, and at the foot of the scaffold, a newly-dug grave. In a short time the increasing thousands had surrounded him, and in another half hour his eye, wherever it wandered, met nothing but the dense masses of human beings, packed close as in a theatre. The murmur of those thousands and thousands of voices, all blended into one sound, all full of one thought, of one expectation, could be heard rising into the air, like the rush of the surf on the distant beach. In a few moments several carriages—of the different functionaries who, from curiosity or duty, attended the scene—drove up a narrow passage kept open through the crowd by the mounted gens d'armes. Then came a body of cavalry, who were drawn up in a hollow square around the scaffold. Several companies of infantry followed, all silently and briefly disposed in the same solemn array; and a group of officers gathered in the centre at the foot of the scaffold, conversing together with cheerful courtesy, and exchanging gayly the greetings of the day. It seemed almost a mockery to Claude, that all this formidable array of force—these stern troops—these glittering and bristling arms—these trampling horses—should be gathered together on account of one helpless, trembling, feeble creature, bound, and opposing against the appalling preparations only his misery, his weakness, his humble prayer, his ghastly and terror-stricken face. As yet no one had appeared upon the scaffold—that solitude to be presently filled by such unnatural actors. At length a single form mounted upon it. He bore on his arm a basket, and sprinkled from it many handfuls of wet sand or sawdust. He descended, and another mounted the next moment, bearing a heavy burden, which he at length deposited. It was set with some care to secure it a firm stand. It was the block. He who placed it was smoking a segar. A broad leathern strap hung from it on one side, and a cord was flung down carelessly upon it. A hum of horror followed each of these proceedings; and the attention of the vast concourse, fixed with an intense interest upon these ominous arrangements, hushed them to a profound silence and motionlessness, except when some trivial preparation gave a token more of the dire act about to be perpetrated, and drew forth a new murmur of horror. The hour for the execution was fixed at six o'clock. It now wanted five minutes. Every face in that vast multitude was turned towards the narrow channel which had been kept open through it by the gens d'armes for the melancholy cortège about to appear. At length a troop of horse rode up, and a half-suppressed cry announced that he—the unhappy object of this deep curiosity, of these appalling preparations— had arrived. A heavy common wagon appeared. In it were two priests. Seated on the floor of it, with his back to the horses, without a hat, was Carl. He caught Claude's eye as he passed, and kissed his hand to him. He looked calm, but dreadfully pale. At the foot of the scaffold there was a pause. They stopped beside the grave; the unhappy being must have looked into it as he passed. He alighted from the wagon, and some moments were occupied in reading the sentence and other customary forms. In the mean time, six or eight persons had mounted the scaffold. They were common-looking men, in their ordinary dress. They walked backward and forward, turned their eyes towards the vast, hushed multitude on every side, or regarded the group of priests and officers gathered about the prisoner. One of them, also, was smoking a segar. They had a careless, rude air, which jarred upon the feelings of many a gazer. Vol. II.—P The preliminary ceremony being over, several persons mounted the scaffold. Among them were two who struck every eye, and drained the blood from every cheek. One was the fine-looking, erect young man about to yield his life to the society which thus repulsed him. The other was a giant in stature and strength—his hair sprinkled with gray—without his coat—and holding in his hand an axe. They had no sooner mounted than some one approached Carl and spoke to him. He started slightly at first, but, instantly complying, took off his coat, his waistcoat, his cravat, and rolled down his shirt off his neck and shoulders to the waist. He then stood erect over the block, clasped his hands, and lifted his eyes towards heaven in prayer. His face was turned towards Claude, whose whole system thrilled with unspeakable horror at the thoughts of his sensations in that tremendous moment. The endless mass of heads on every side was uncovered—motionless—hushed. Claude looked around on the scene so fair and beautiful. The morning sun mounting up the east, pouring gladness and abundance on so many millions of human beings— the bending sky—the waving trees—the distant city, whose roar could be heard rising on the summer air, and then at these vast crowds—those dark columns— that gray-headed giant leaning on his axe—and this young man, in the fullness of life, health, and strength, about to be thrust by his fellow-beings into eternity. Even as he stood thus a moment committing himself to God, and taking his last look at the nature so bright, so soft, so fair, so happy, the breeze, full of freshness, and balm, and gladness, and perfume, came kissing the murmuring tree-tops, and lifted the hair from that doomed head; the birds were warbling in the groves; the flowers were blooming in the gardens; the streams were gurgling through the wood; and a flock of pigeons came floating down to the very top of the scaffold, and made a circle around it, their white breasts shining in the light, and then—so near that the trembling victim might have heard the whirring of their wings, full of freedom and joy—swept off again, and were lost in the sunshiny distance. The next instant the wretched being knelt and laid his neck on its last resting-place; the strap was instantly fastened over his shoulders, and his arms were tied to the block. The executioner advanced—lifted the axe, to lay its edge lightly on the spot he would strike. There was a blow, and an object fell heavily and rolled upon the scaffold. Some hand raised it by the hair—held the face, bloody, turbid, and convulsed, one instant to the crowd—and then wrapped it in a white napkin, which instantly assumed the same gory hue. Hasty hands unloosed the cord and strap, and a headless trunk was carelessly borne down and thrown into the grave already dug. It was to avoid the odium of bearing a blow that the wretched youth had sought the fate of a felon. There are readers who will shrink from this scene —who will find it too revolting to be described. Yes, it is revolting; but it should be painted in all its details, till the most audacious outrage upon humanity ever sanctioned by human laws shall be struck from the code of civilized nations. That which it is not permitted to describe should not be permitted to take place in the open day—before the public eye—before boys—women—children. Were all to witness the frightful spectacle, this ancient and barbarous custom would cease. If we have dared to hold the hideous picture up, it is that people who never give their attention to such things may know—may see what goes on about them—what they are liable to meet in their morning walk—openly perpetrated in the bright sunshine—in the public streets.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XXI. The Carolans had not been long gone when strange reports became general of the increasing anarchy in France. It was said that the utmost prudence was requisite in every resident of that unhappy country to avoid fatal collisions with one or the other of the raging parties. Every day brought fugitives who described their flight to have been attended with unheardof perils. It was at length stated that the frontiers of France were closed against all future departures, and that the royal family themselves wished to leave their throne and native land, but were unable to do so. Day after day the accounts grew more alarming. Prussia, as indeed all Europe, was becoming more and more agitated. Poor Claude would have followed Carolan into France had he possessed the pecuniary means; but, alas! the interest excited by his private affairs was merged in that of the general welfare. The most enthusiastic admirers of English abandoned their studies for thoughts of a much more serious kind, and Claude found himself destitute. His friends had disappeared. Lavalle had gone to France again some time before. The Prussian army was put in motion. A tempest, vague and dark, seemed lowering over mankind. All Europe trembled. The Countess Carolan received news of her husband which threw her into a malady—from which she was threatened to be speedily released by death. Carolan, it was said, had been seized by the revolutionists—accused of attempting to aid the king—and thrown into prison, from which it was feared he would not escape with his life. Of Ida and St. Marie, no news could be obtained. It was a dreadful year; and as for Claude, in addition to all his apprehensions for Ida, he was often at a loss for means to support life. No one would lend money at such a period; and, had there been lenders, he had no right to borrow what he saw no prospect of being able to repay. All occupation was at a stand. Europe appeared waiting, as men do beneath a black cloud, from which they look each moment to see burst the dreadful bolt, without daring to conjecture where it is to fall. In the actual course of necessity, to prevent himself from starving, he had contracted a bill at a baker's. It was for the simplest aliment which could sustain the body. It was for common bread. He owed the baker one thaler. The man demanded his money. Claude could not pay it. This new creditor was a large, portly, broad-shouldered person, with no neck, and a high, square head, the size of which almost amounted to deformity. His features were all, in a corresponding degree, large and uncouth. His eyes were round, green, and protuberant, and shaded by large shaggy brows. His nose was bloated, purple, and with hairs growing on the end. His mouth stretched from ear to ear, and his whole countenance, ploughed with time and debauchery, and Heaven knows what volcanic passions, looked like some ragged rock rent apart by a convulsion of nature. No smile ever softened those deeply-indented outlines, as no human feelings found their way into his long-hardened heart. His voice was hoarse, deep, and guttural; and when he spoke, even on the most trivial occasions, he grew red in the face with choler. His head was perfectly white—his limbs were swollen and gouty—his feet resembled those of an elephant—his hands were full of knots like the gnarled branches of some immemorial oak, and he had a spirit as unbendable. He was worth, men said, 300,000 thalers, accumulated by grasping every cent. On finding Claude's inability to pay, this curious old veteran, who perhaps might be regarded as something of a maniac in his way, sued him and obtained judgment, and took measures to cast him into prison. “He shall stay there his year,” said he, “or pay me my thaler.” P 2 Claude went to him, in company with the sheriff's officer who had arrested him, and endeavoured to soften his heart. The old man became furious at the sight of him. His face, always half purple, grew fiery with rage, and he swore he would have his thaler or his body. “You are a scoundrel,” said he, “to rob me of my money. You are my slave till you pay me. I hold to the law. Go! away with him. He is a robber.” And Claude was thrown into the very prison—the very room—and with the very people who had formerly been his companions under the same circumstances, although with two or three ominous exceptions. In this position, Claude found himself at the lowest step of the ladder. He was a beggar—a wretch—a slave. He saw no other prospect than a year's confinement. An unutterable anguish came cold and deadening over his heart as he turned his eyes about the room, and regarded the gloomy, pitiless walls which had enclosed him—which were to shut him out from the world. As for soliciting aid, he knew no one among all his acquaintances to whom he could apply but St. Hillaire, Lavalle, and Madame Wharton. All of these were absent. For an instant the thought of self-destruction once more rose in his mind. The resources of his life seemed to be exhausted. He had struggled against a fate that was too much for him. Fortune, as if resolved to pursue him with persevering malice, had stripped him of everything which cheers, adorns, and blesses human life. No domestic affection shed an interior sunshine on his heart. No revered and beloved father—no affectionate and ever-watchful mother—no sister, with her unchanging fidelity and attachment—no brother, bound to him with the sustaining ties of friendship and truth—of old associations and mutual confidence. The only affection which had ever risen in his breast was quenched in dark and hopeless humiliation; and he felt that, in addition to all these, poverty, captivity, disgrace—the desertion of his friends—the disgust he had conceived at the conduct of some from whom he had expected nobler conduct—the silence and apparent forgetfulness of Madame Wharton, who had impressed him with a warm esteem and friendship, altogether seemed to present life worthless, and death as the greatest happiness which could befall him. He reflected what an old Roman would do when honour, hope, and all were lost; and the words of the lofty and philosophic Cassius rose to his lips with a sad and solemn meaning: “Cassius from bondage will deliver Cassius: Therein, ye gods, ye make the weak most strong; Therein, ye gods, you tyrants do defeat: Nor strong tower, nor walls of beaten brass, Nor airless dungeon, nor strong links of iron, Can be retentive to the strength of spirit; But life, being weary of these worldly bars, Never lacks power to dismiss itself. If I know this, know all the world besides, That part of tyranny that I do bear, I can shake off at pleasure.” But, happily, he had learned to govern his impulses, and to seek his rules of action in a better school than the erring genius of heathen philosophy. A man who has borne slander, insult, and a blow from a sense of right, and who has turned from the woman he loved without a look rather than lead astray a young heart disposed to requite his affection, will do nothing rash, but has in it a principle of the truest courage as a support in the darkest hour. With an humble prayer to Him who can cast down and put up, who giveth and who taketh away, he “filed his mind”—he turned in upon himself—repressed his despair, and resolved to await with resignation the will of Heaven.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XXII. He had passed thus several days with all his philosophy and religion, pale, sad, and silent, when the jailer called him down to receive a visiter. It was a stranger, booted and spurred in the English fashion, and speaking the English language. He approached and handed two letters. Claude opened and read. The first was as follows: “London, etc., etc. “Messrs. W. P. &amp; Co., Berlin. “Gentlemen: “At the request of the Marquis of E—, and for his account, we hereby open a credit with you in favour of Mr. Claude Wyndham, for £1000 sterling, say one thousand pounds sterling, which you will please to supply him with, as he may require the same, on his presenting to you this letter. “We are, gentlemen, “Yours truly, “N. B. &amp; Co.” The other was from Madame Wharton. The first words thrilled him with emotion, which would have been rapture had it not been so mingled with bewilderment and incredulity. “My son—my beloved son! “You, who have borne adversity with greatness, will, I trust, meet prosperity with dignity. I have at length succeeded in throwing back the veil which Heaven in its wisdom had allowed to fall over us. You are, as from the first moment my secret presentiment might have taught me, the child of my bosom. Enclosed is a package which I have prepared for you. It reveals your history and mine. I would give you no intimation of my convictions till they were confirmed. Not from my hand should you receive a new disappointment. The bill which accompanies this is your own. Do not hesitate to use it. It is but a small part of the inheritance of which you are now the master. Your father was the Earl of Beverly. That title is now yours. He has just expired, having previously completed all the arrangements essential to your undisputed assumption of his titles and estates. This great blessing of Providence I am fain to receive as a reward for a life spent in the path of right; but, in receiving it, let us not forget that all earthly blessings come mixed with calamity, and that there is no state of steady happiness but beyond the grave. I write to you calmly, my beloved son, from the very intensity of my feelings. I did not put pen to paper till I had calmed them by prayer, and sought from Him who gives and takes away the strength necessary to support me in this mixed hour of joy and sorrow. I have much to tell you, and my bosom yearns to hold you again, my son! Come to me as soon as you can, without neglecting duties more imperative. I have seen you sorely tried, and I know you to be equal to your own guidance; but remember that life is short, and the greatest happiness I can now know is your society. Everything is arranged for you without trouble. On reaching London you will drive to your own mansion in Grosvenor Square, lately occupied by your father, and just as he left it. The Marquis of E— acts as your agent till your arrival, and begs me to say how profoundly he rejoices at this important change in your prospects. Come, my son! I would repeat the sacred name, and I would repeat ever, to the Disposer of human events, my prayer of grateful thanks for being permitted to write myself—your affectionate, “Your too happy mother, “Ellen Lawton.” The packet which accompanied this was, as stated by Madame Wharton—whom, as well as Claude, we shall continue to call by her old name—a full history of the circumstances which attended her marriage, her separation from her husband, her subsequent life, the loss and apparent death of her child, with divers other particulars, many of which the reader is already acquainted with. It is to be regretted that the space allotted to our history will not permit us to give this letter, embracing, as it did, not only the past adventures of the lady—who now showed herself as able to bear prosperity as she had been to bear adversity—but the circumstances which first awakened her attention respecting Claude — her reveries, her suspicions, her hopes, and, lastly, her convictions, that the singular interest she had taken in the stranger who bore so remarkable a resemblance to her husband, from the first moment she saw him, was not merely accidental. The manuscript which the gracious permission of the courteous librarian who rules over the mute population of immortal tomes in la Bibliotheque du Roi has enabled us to consult in throwing together our story, gives this letter, with many marks of admiration and wonder at the striking and (the writer says, in a note) apparently improbable incidents which distinguished the attempt of this injured lady to regain her rights in behalf of her son, and to establish her own innocence. It informs us of a fact, that at the interview between Lady Beverly and Elkington, where this rash and wicked person, trained by the habitual indulgence of his passions, dared to strike even a woman—and that woman his mother, and where all that Lady Beverly knew of her history was revealed; it informs us that Carl, who, on having been dismissed by Claude, had been taken into the employ of Elkington, and who was all the time ensconced under the bed between two large portmanteaux, thus possessed himself of the whole history; and, having already read all Claude's letters, journals, &amp;c., his active mind commenced examining the subject as one worthy of his powers; and at length, by a coincidence which would appear perfectly natural had we time to explain it, alighted upon the traces of Madame Wharton as being one of the characters in this game of blind-man's-buff. Thinking he might make a good affair of it, he communicated to Madame Wharton all he knew; which so perfectly accorded with the thousand indications she had herself discovered, that she set off for London to institute inquiries and take the necessary measures. In this she had been baffled for a long time, occasioning much delay; but at length, by great sagacity and prudence, and the aid of several distinguished auxiliaries, of whom the Marquis of E— was one—by recovering from the heirs of Lord Perceval many of his private memoranda upon the history of Claude, which, from his likeness to his father, Lord Perceval had also suspected—in short, with Carl's evidence, and by an appeal to the young noble, Lord —, who had, with Lady Beverly, been one of the instruments of her ruin, and who was now a gouty, bloated, bed-ridden old man, willing to purchase by any confession an exemption from the consequences which the revival of his youthful “follies” would bring upon him—in short, the whole history was made clear, that Lord Elkington and Lady Beverly had been all the while absent from London, the latter being too ill to travel; that it wanted but the recovery of the earl to an hour's use of his senses to procure his recognition of an innocent wife and a lost son, both worthy of him. As if Fortune were loath to spoil such a fine train of affairs, the earl recovered in an unexpected manner, and was for several days in the full possession of his strength and clear reason. Our unpractised hand must not attempt to describe the denouément, nor relate the earl's emotions when convinced that he had committed a whole life of injustice by prematurely crediting a calumny; and when he beheld once more in his presence her who had left him a radiant and tender girl, and pure as the dewy rose, and who now appeared with the transformations of twenty years in her person. Many traces of that soft face, however, were preserved—for temperance and virtue are potent cosmetics; and their mutual recognition furnished a scene fitter for the inspired hand of Shakspeare than ours. Indeed, her visit to London would itself furnish forth an edifying romance. The lofty character and personal beauty of his son, when they were recounted to the earl in this brief but delicious interval between life and death, swelled his bosom with unutterable joy and a natural desire to behold him. But this was not to be gratified; for he had no sooner, in presence of the Marquis of E— and several others of his ancient friends, freely and legally completed the arrangements necessary to the succession of Claude, and exchanged with his devoted wife a pardon which strewed the dismal path of death with roses, than the remorseless tyrant, who could wait no longer, suddenly laid his cold hand upon him; and Madame Wharton trembled to perceive that she had recovered the treasure so priceless and so long lost, only to behold it—for such is human joy—slip again and for ever from her grasp. Hence her triumph was sad, and her success so mixed with sorrow, that the dazzling revolution in her condition did not disturb the usual composure of her soul, or produce any remarkable change in her manners. A P.S. stated that the bearer was a confidential valet of the Marquis of E—, and that his honesty, knowledge, and discretion were to be implicitly trusted.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XXIII. While Claude was reading this long communication, the messenger, who had been despatched on the occasion as one capable of rendering the most requisite information and services under the present circumstances, had ascertained the debt for which his new master was imprisoned, and had sent to pay the same. Claude had not finished studying this deeply-interesting letter when the order arrived for his release. The man respectfully asked for his farther commands. “Have the prisoners all assembled at once,” said Claude, “and ascertain the aggregate amount of their debts.” A group of poor devils gathered around with awestruck looks, for they had just learned that their fellow-prisoner was no less a personage than the Earl of Beverly, and as rich as the king. The sum of their debt was one hundred and eighty thalers. Some of them had been confined for eleven months. “Pay them all,” said Claude, “and give every man a five thaler note. Find out, also, an appropriate café, and order a good dinner for them to drink my health. Attend to this first.” The crowd of poor wretches, in their greasy sheepskin robes de chambre, looked at each other and at the beneficent being who, as if fallen from heaven, had thus suddenly appeared among them. It was curious to observe the various effects which the announcement of their release had upon their respective deportments. Some stood stupified—some danced, leaped about, and shouted like madmen—some ran up to him, knelt, and kissed the hem of his coat—some broke out into fierce exclamations of delight, mingled with oaths—and one stood perfectly still, betraying his emotion only by his silent tears. It is possible that a portion of these worthy gentlemen would have done society quite as much service under lock and key as at large; but there were others who presented cases of homely but real misfortune. The poor fellow last alluded to, whose eyes filled with tears of gratitude and joy, Claude found had been imprisoned for one thaler the day before. He had left a sick, motherless child at home, and had Vol. II.—Q gone out to buy medicine, when his creditor laid hands on him, and, deaf to every prayer and explanation, threw him into prison. Other proper donations were ordered, particularly to the good commissioner and the honest turnkey; and James, with that unalterable respect with which a good English servant always communicates with his master, touched his hat and stated that a carriage was ready, and that he had already procured apartments in a hotel for his lordship. As one in an enchanting dream, Claude took up his worn hat and prepared to bid adieu for ever to this dismal abode. As he reached the lower corridor, prisoners, turnkeys, commissioners, gens d'armes, were all ranged on either side to see him pass. Every hand was extended, every face was lighted with joy. No kingly palace in Europe showed a happier picture on that day, and many a one a more sad, than the medley of friends who greeted, with hearty tokens of respect and admiration, the now once more uplifted brow of our hero. As the doors opened, and a waft of fresh air came to his heated face, and the honest fellows saw a plain but very elegant carriage waiting, and their patron aided into it by his servant, the ordinary restrictions of the prison were forgotten alike by keeper and prisoner, and three cheers were given, again, again, and again, so that they had turned the corner before these vociferous ebullitions of triumph had died away. Lost in astonishment, bewildered, and incredulous, and fearing each moment to awake and find around him the naked and blackened walls of a loathsome prison, which were to bury him, perhaps for life, from the blessed light of nature, Claude reached his hotel, ordered a warm bath, some linen, and his old tailor. He found that James had chosen the most fashionable hotel in the town, and selected the best apartments in it. He was, in fact, by a curious coincidence, in the very rooms formerly occupied by Elkington, and from which he had gone forth to the fatal encounter with poor, poor Denham! and this presenting a new idea, he sat down and instantly wrote his London banker the name of that lady, and desired that she might be sought and supplied with what funds she might require. He wrote also to her. By this time his bath —a luxury he had not enjoyed for many a month—arrived, the men bringing it approaching him with profound salutations and distant awe. James ministered to him like an angel. He not only supplied all his slightest wishes before they were expressed, but he even suggested them before they were formed; and as if borne floating, without care or effort, on some enchanting tide, everything went exactly as it should. Everybody came exactly at the proper moment. The tailor had on hand, yet unsold, all his ample and elegant wardrobe. James himself was a barber, tailor, housekeeper, valet, courier, counsellor, and friend, all in one, and without ever presuming upon a smile or look of familiarity, or performing his innumerable and delightful services as other than the ordinary noiseless and delicate attentions of a thorough-bred English valet. The bath was brought to his room. He was left alone. He sat down on a sofa with a singular feeling. He was now rich. The secret which had covered him with odium and sorrow was revealed. He was placed among the great and opulent of the earth. Ida, who loved him—all obstacles to their union were removed. His heart, like a goblet full to overflowing, trembled with the weight of its oppressive load. His past life—his loneliness—his abandonment—his prison —those dismal, filthy walls—those rude, coarse crowds among whom he had been thrust—his poverty—his anguish, came sweeping over him now in such a solemn and dark train of images—such phantoms of horror— such remorseless fiends, from whom he had been rescued by that unseen Hand whose aid he had invoked —all that despair and humiliation could not do, this moment of happiness effected; and, overcome with his emotions, he laid his face in his hands—an agitation like an earthquake passed through his soul—shook the very foundations of his being—and tears, such as he had never shed before, rose to his eyelids and fell silently to the floor. “And God grant,” he thought, as relieved by his tears, an exquisite sense of the reality and luxury of his new position came over him, “that it may never make my heart as hard and inflated as Carolan's.” Carolan! his mother! Ida! Thoughts pressed on him too soft, too daring, too dazzling. His unaccustomed mind could not receive them. They pained and oppressed by their brightness and magnitude. He turned from them, resolving to give the day to idleness, incapacitated as he was for any serious employment or meditation. He had about half finished dinner when a waiter announced a stranger. “But my lord is occupied,” said James. Claude started—was he speaking of him? “My lord is at dinner!” continued James. “The gentleman must see his lordship!” said the man, in an under tone. “He says he is an old, dear friend.” “Lavalle!” said Claude, with eager pleasure. “Show him in, James!” And with a good deal of noise and in a perturbation of delight, hastening to him and embracing him with the liveliest marks of friendship, in rushed Thomson. “My dear Wyndham! my dear, dear fellow! I beg you ten thousand pardons for interrupting your dinner—but old friends, you know! Thank God! I have found you at last. I have heard it all. I congratulate you, my dearest fellow—I do, upon my soul! I am the first—ain't I? I have been travelling after you in a drosky. I went down to the prison—to the police. Enfin vous voici! I am the happiest dog in the world. But what's the matter? You look ill—you look grave. Allons! Take a glass of Champagne. Garçon, some wine! That will revive you. This is too much for your shattered nerves. Dieu! how I have felt for you!” James stood motionless, but glanced his eye at his master. “Pour him out a glass of wine, James,” said Claude, coldly. Thomson took it and drank it; but all its foaming inspiration could not counteract the effect of the cold courtesy with which Claude received him. “What! Comment! vous ne buvez pas, mon cher? Que diable! What's the matter? I hope no ill news.” “Of a kind,” said Claude, “which will prevent my enjoying the society of Mr. Thomson any longer; therefore I shall make no apology for depriving myself of it. James, show the gentleman down.” “Comment! Positively! c'est de rigueur! Well, I'll look in again. Don't think to get rid of me so easily, mon cher. Nothing I love better than old friends. Adieu! Au revoir! a demain, mon enfant! Don't come to the stairs. Au revoir!” The next day—for the public journals had given the news, although erroneously in many particulars, yet correctly in the general outline—carriage after carriage came thundering to the door, and a regiment of chasseurs, with a perfect shower of cards. Claude had left orders to be out. As each card was brought in upon a silver salver, by a white-gloved domestic, to him who yesterday was on the point of starving in a jail for a thaler! Claude saw, with that quiet contempt which the conduct of many people is calculated to inspire for human nature, that they who had been most marked in their slights of him in the moment of his downfall, and who had not recognised him even when he spoke to them, were now among the first to call; but he saw also, with a bounding heart, the names of many whom he sincerely esteemed and loved, and who had been the same to him in all things, whether Q 2 prosperity shone on him, or dark misfortune lowered around his head. He was now on an eminence whence he could choose his friends; and he resolved, while he was courteous to all, and while he laid aside every thought of relaliation against those who had exposed their meanness and folly (except, indeed, individuals who, like Thomson, had been offensive by their impertinence), that he would cherish with sincerity those gentle and refined hearts whose sweetness and purity had been tasted when they could never expect any return. The poor old woman with whom he had lodged claimed his attention, and he settled on her a small but sufficient annuity. He returned in haste the calls of his brilliant friends, who once more sought him with new avidity. He made friendly visits to a few families whom he really found worthy of lasting friendship. He spent a long evening with the good Mr. Kühl, whose respect for him almost interfered with his friendship, and who could call him nothing but “monseigneur.” A few days were occupied on these matters. He had written daily to his mother; and could we present to the reader those effusions of his soul, now for the first time giving vent to affections which had been so long pent up in its hidden recesses, they would be found interesting specimens of his mind and nature. James proposed that they should set out immediately for London; but then first learned, with a consternation which he could not conceal, that his young master had determined to go directly to France. “But your lordship does not know, perhaps,” said James, “that France is in the whirl of a revolution which threatens to swallow up thousands, without discrimination of rank or innocence. The Marquis of E— is informed distinctly on the subject. If you venture within the precincts of that unhappy country, you will never escape alive. You are an Englishman, and the slightest tinge in your accent will betray you to the guillotine. Your rank and fortune will make you but a more conspicuous mark. Your death is as certain, my lord, as if you walked into the crater of a volcano. It is infatuation—it is madness. No one can live there without continual danger. The very king is trembling for his life. I beg, I implore you to abandon your design. Nothing but a conviction that I am pleading for your life could make me so free in addressing your lordship.” “My good James,” said Claude, “I may confide to you the secret that a valued friend is almost alone and defenceless in the midst of these dangers, which you depict, I do not doubt, without exaggeration. It is true that my hope of even finding her is vague—of rescuing her is more so; but I am resolved to try.” “Her?” said James; “a lady! Then I fear it is all over with us.” “I may add, that she is one in whom Madame— in whom my mother is as much interested as I. You must prepare everything for my departure to-morrow morning.” “Your lordship will excuse me from accompanying you farther than the frontier, because I regard going farther as certain death.” “Certainly,” said Claude; “I shall go alone and immediately.” James said no more, but shook his head ominously. The next evening there was a grand soirée chez le Prince R. A strong curiosity prevailed to see the young hero, whom fortune appeared to have rewarded so munificently for his firm adherence to a principle. The cause of Elkington's persecutions was now perfectly clear. Claude's courage once established, as it had been by his brave deportment in the affair of Rossi and Ida, his previous forbearance was found sublime; and every one longed to greet him, and to repair by their attentions their former neglect. The assembly was crowded and brilliant in the extreme; and many a beautiful toilet was arranged with additional care at the thoughts that this now distinguished young nobleman was to behold it. The disappointment and surprise were great when it was understood that he had that morning left town for Paris! “Ah Dieu! was the general exclamation. “Il faut du courage pour ça!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XXIV. It was on the fifth of August, in the year 1792, that Claude entered Paris. James had left him at the frontier, and expressed his determination to remain at Nymeguen during his sojourn in France, with a supply of money to be sent in case of need, though he presaged the most fearful difficulties and perils from his present undertaking. The best arrangements which his cool head and great experience in matters connected with the Continent—for he had been many years a courier, and spoke the French and German as well as the English—the best arrangements he could make were speedily agreed upon between them. A man was employed—a trusty and perfectly confidential Frenchman, by name Adolphe, long known to James—to remain with him at Nymeguen, that, in case of need, he might be the messenger between them. An ample remuneration was offered him should he be successful in his task. Of his fidelity there was no doubt. Some plain clothes, such as were worn by the most violent republicans of France, were procured for Claude; and it was determined—for his accent would have scarcely betrayed the foreigner—that he should pass for a Frenchman at any risk, and one fully infected with the revolutionary views. The address of a man perfectly known to Adolphe, resident in Paris, who could be applied to in emergency, and who could probably supply what money was desired, was also given. Thus prepared, with 100 Louis in his pocket, a complete French Jacobin in costume, ready to meet any peril, our young adventurer set forth on his search after Carolan and Ida, determined never to abandon the pursuit while the smallest possibility remained of rendering them service. He entered Paris in the morning. The day was fair, and imparted a singular beauty to the picturesque streets and tall houses of this celebrated metropolis. His first step was to visit Count la Tour, to whom he had a particular letter of introduction in Berlin, as one likely to know something of the now mysterious fate of Carolan and his daughter. On his way to the residence of this person, he was struck with the singular aspect of the town. This great city always awakens the attention of the newly-arrived by its striking forms, its streets, its dense, crowded lines of high houses, its salient points and angles—here steeped in sunshine, there merged in heavy shadow. Amid the heavy, grotesque, interminable masses through which the narrow streets open on every side, in lines straight, circular, serpentine, accustomed for some days to silent hills, open plains, and green and tranquil woods, Claude, although perfectly acquainted with Paris, felt himself a little bewildered. But it was the character of the population that now filled the streets which made his heart tremble for the fate of those in whom he was deeply interested. It was far different from that which usually imparted an air of gayety and enjoyment to the most charming metropolis in the world. Hordes of ruffians were seen lurking around, and bands of women half clothed, having on their countenances the marks of debauchery and evil passions. These debased creatures had an air of insolence which betrayed how weak was the usual municipal authority, and how secure they felt themselves in the exercise of whatever dissoluteness or misdemeanours they might choose to be guilty of. They shouted, hooted, whooped, and communicated with each other by all kinds of uncouth noises and obscene gestures. It was at once apparent to Claude, that some convulsion either had happened or was about to take place, for the population presented that appearance observable when any violent shock passes over a large town, causing a kind of chymical separation of the constituent parts of society—the reputable classes disappearing to the shelter of their own houses, while the profligate and abandoned appear from their dark lurking-places in the light of day. These ruffians wore filthy jackets, large coarse trousers, and red flannel caps. Many were equipped with girdles furnished with pistols, dirks, and enormous knives. He saw, with a new horror, that this rude costume, by its general adoption, was not an accidental dress, but a kind of uniform, assumed for, he shuddered to conjecture what dreadful enterprise. Never before had he beheld a collection of such hideous and formidable beings, and their manner was as ominous as their appearance. Some stalked by him with scowling and ferocious countenances. Some wore that kind of smile which a ruffian wears when he feels that he may perpetrate with impunity the worst of crimes. Of these not a few appeared to act the part of guides and leaders, whispering about the mob, giving sometimes weapons, and sometimes drink and money. The under fiends of the revolution were here doing their work. Making his way through these crowds, and not unfrequently regarded with a scrutiny which would have made most men quail, sometimes rudely addressed with a rough jest or a rough slap on the back, he reached the house of the Count de la Tour—the friend of Carolan. “I wish to see Monsieur le Comte de la Tour,” said Claude to the porter. “If you mean the Citizen La Tour,” was the surly reply, “you'll find him up stairs.” The domestic who opened the door of the Citizen La Tour's apartment eyed the new-comer narrowly before he admitted him. Claude requested to speak at once with the count, and in private. He was admitted, gave his letter, and related the object of his visit. “My friend,” said La Tour, when he had finished, “have you any idea of the things which are going on here just now?” “I see something dreadful is going to happen,” said Claude, “but I am determined not to turn back.” The Citizen La Tour looked cautiously around, and said, “Excuse my frankness, my young friend; but, in my opinion, you are as little acquainted with France as the world. Carolan—Citizen Carolan—we have no more counts now—is in prison—in the Conciergerie— whence he will no more escape with his head than you would if you were to make the slightest inquiry after him, to say nothing of an attempt to see him.” “Great Heaven! are you in earnest?” “As you will be if you stay here another week. Save him? say you! Save yourself, and that forthwith. Your design is wild, dangerous, and impossible. What tie binds you to such a perilous scheme? The man is an ass of the first water. His head is too empty to be worth saving. He thrust it, like a fool, into the lion's jaws. Many a better one is doomed to fall before this coil is finished.” “May I ask after his daughter?” demanded Claude. “Ah—so! there is a girl, I remember.” “Have you seen her?” “Yes—a pretty creature! She is with the queen at the palace. It was managed, I know not how, by the friends of the royal family, that she should be received nominally as a compagnon of her majesty till the danger is over.” “Then she is safe!” said Claude. “Sorry to chase that extremely interesting expression of pleasure,” said La Tour, laughing; “but she is in more danger in the palace, in my opinion, than she would be in the meanest hut in France.” “You cannot mean—” said Claude. “Yes, I do mean the worst. Where are you lodged?” “At the little Hotel de France, in the section du Theatre Français.” “Ah—the devil! You are in the very centre of the Cordeliers. Take my advice, young gentleman; abandon your hair-brained scheme, and leave your pretty countess to take care of herself. These are no times for Quixotic expeditions, and there are as good fish in the sea as ever came out of it!” “No, I shall remain; and I am happy to have found from you the information I desired. Can I by no means be permitted to see the count, or the young Countess Carolan?” “No — impossible! Communication is carefully guarded. If you are resolved to follow the silly example of your friend, and wait till they come to truss you like a fowl, take my advice—it is all I can give you. In France, at present, there is but one crime. It is being suspected of opposing the revolution. They are all mad. The nation is a lunatic. Don't trifle with it. If you cannot escape from it, humour it.” “I have faced one lunatic,” said Claude, quietly, “and I will not shrink from another. I shall stay.” “Well, then, live plainly—meanly, if possible— make no acquaintances—no confidences—say nothing —burn all letters—write nothing—shout `Vive la Revolution!' and `à bas le Roi!'—watch every look and action—don't breathe an opinion—don't even whistle a tune. Three of my friends, who were to have fled to-morrow, lie this instant in a dungeon, from which they will never escape alive, because a parrot in the house in which they lived cried `Vive le Roi!'[1] [1] A fact. Beware of any expressions of sympathy—any impulses of disgust, horror, or disapprobation. There is a danger beneath, around, and above you. Distrust everybody — your landlord — your friend — your servant. The whole town are spies; and if you see my head to-mororow morning carried by your window on a pike, don't frown, or murmur, or even start. Let no one know who you are. Become a beggar in attire and a Jacobin in deportment.” “Are things indeed so desperate?” said Claude, greatly alarmed for the success of his enterprise. “You cannot escape,” continued La Tour, “but by seeming to abet the revolution. Shout for the nation! and the republic! Down with the veto! Down with the Austrian! Vive Danton! Vive Petion! Vive Santerre!” A hoarse shout from the street here broke upon their interview. “Let us see what this is,” said La Tour. They walked to the window. Cries of “à la lanterne! à la lanterne!” were now audible, and were mingled with the heavy tramping of a thousand feet. The mob were dragging to a lamp just opposite an unhappy young man, livid with terror, by a rope around his neck. He struggled, strove to kneel, and screamed, but his voice was drowned in shouts. He was thrust to the fatal spot, and the cord thrown over the crosspiece. “Let us save him!” cried Claude. “This is horrible!” and he was about to throw up the window. La Tour drew him forcibly back. “Are you mad? Have you already forgotten? A pretty fellow for a revolution! Save him, indeed! ha! ha! ha! Leave him to his fate. Bless your simple heart, this is nothing new! This is of daily— ha!—hark!” They listened. A hoarse and deafening shout, mingled with screams and peals of laughter, were heard. “Hark! Poor devil! he's off already! Hark again!—ah! the bloodhounds!” Vol. II.—R “How can he have merited this horrible fate?” exclaimed Claude. “Merited? Why, very likely by turning pale, as you do, at some similar scene! You are but poorly fitted for your wise scheme if this trifle makes you change colour. I have seen so much of this sort of thing that I am quite used to it, and have no other sentiment than a secret self-congratulation that I am not in the poor wretch's place—that my turn has not come yet!! ha! ha! ha!” “Why don't you escape?” demanded Claude. “I dare not. Their eye is upon me; and, by-the-way, I wish you wouldn't come here again. I am afraid of you. You are so extremely unsophisticated. That whey-face of yours will get itself into trouble, and its friends too. I'll call on you at your hotel; and, if you wish, I can get you a passport to accompany a division of the army to the frontier; I have that influence yet; and, once there, you can escape easily.” “No,” said Claude; “what I have seen only makes me more determined not to abandon my friends.” “Well, you're a brave fellow! but—excuse my freedom—you'll regret the refusal of my offer before a month. This is no child's play. They're in earnest —these fellows. As for the king and queen, and all around them—ah! parbleu!” “What of them? What can happen to place them in danger? What have they to fear?” “Hark—in your ear—” and even La Tour turned pale as he leaned his head forward and whispered, “The scaffold, mon cher!” Claude started, the blood curdling in his veins with astonishment and horror. “You are mad!” said he, sternly, “or you are trifling with my fears.” “All earth—all heaven can't save them. Don't I know?—haven't I seen?—am I a fool? par exemple! And you—you, who can't hear of these things without turning white behind your ears—what can you do but fly—if, indeed, it be not already too late for that? I like your spirit, though. You're a brave fellow, and, if you wish, I'll save you by the means I spoke of.” “What!” said Claude, sadly but firmly, “leave those I most love to the scaffold? Turn from them in the last hour of deadly danger? No, sir. If you can help me to speak with her, or to a place in his majesty's palace—for I hope this tragedy won't be witnessed passively by the people of France—I shall thank you; if not—adieu.” “You are mad!” said La Tour. “Go your own way. But shake hands. I never do so now to a friend without feeling as if one of us was at the foot of the guillotine. I have an appointment—adieu! May we meet again! and, egad—who knows!” Claude left La Tour, scarcely able to reconcile the heartless levity of his conversation with the real services he had offered, and at the same time resolving to adopt such part of his counsel as related to his residence in Paris. He walked with hasty steps towards the garden of the Tuileries, resolving the best means of announcing his presence to Ida, and of taking measures for the escape of herself and father—a task hopeless to all but such a lover as he. Such an entire bouleversement had taken place in society, that he knew not a single person to whom he could apply for aid or information. As he advanced he found the crowds becoming more dense, and a general gloom, agitation, and ferocity pervaded them. Many a dark brow and eye met his sight, cast around, some in apprehension, and some in search of danger. On reaching the garden of the Tuileries, he saw that a large mob was collected in front of the royal chateau. They consisted of the same desperate class of wretches he had already seen, mingled with the most disgusting-looking women he had ever beheld; and deep were the execrations—the obscene jests—the dark threats, and the facetious shouts which were directed by these formidable vagabonds at the royal chateau and its unhappy inmates, and particularly at the unfortunate queen. Here again obscenity appeared a favourite weapon; and the gross insults directed against a female figure which appeared a moment at a window, and was generally believed to be Marie Antoinette, but which Claude's high beating heart fancied the beloved object of his search, caused the lady, whoever she might be, to withdraw immediately. “Come forth! execrable vulture with your Austrian beak!” cried a hoarse, deep voice, elevated as of an orator above all the noises of the crowd, which in some measure disposed itself to listen. “Your doom is written! The people—the people are up! That high head shall be laid low!” “No, by Brutus!” cried another. “We will raise it higher than ever pride and insolent ambition reared it—on a pike! mes enfans!” These sallies were received with tumultuous approbation. When the noises had subsided, the first speaker, who had raised himself on some object answering as a stage, began, in the same deep and powerful voice, to address the crowd. His speech was couched in a wild, declamatory language, and a part of it ran in this fashion: “The good work goes well, my friends!” he said. “The people are up and doing. The tyrants tremble. Their feet shall be no more on your neck!” A shout of triumph from the auditory here interrupted him. Claude regarded this new advocate of national rights with interest. His appearance obviously announced an extraordinary person. He was of a gigantic stature, a heavy, burly, and ferocious countenance, a voice of singular depth and power, and altogether a striking representative and leader of a rabble, who apparently knew him, and regarded his wild and reckless style of eloquence with great admiration. “People of France!” continued the orator, “your oppressors are about to fly from you. The public functionaries are abandoning the country. They are frightened. Every day emigrants are flowing out of France. What for? To excite all Europe against her. To come back and bathe these streets and gardens with your blood. Let no more traitors pass the frontier. Punish the thought of emigration with death! Crush the spirit—the power of opposition. Let us decapitate all who hate our glorious revolution—all who, from their birth, education, character, or position, are likely to oppose it. They who are not for, are against us. Let him die who ever speaks of mercy. Let the word be the signal of death, or it will render the bold bolder, and the strong stronger. This is a struggle between two powers, wherein one or the other must be exterminated. We must destroy our destroyers, or be destroyed ourselves. The king, Louis Capet, is leaguing with foreign courts. He wishes to inundate France with foreign troops. Will you have Austrian and Prussian bayonets at your doors and at your throats? Let us speak to the king—to his ministers —to Europe—to mankind, with firmness and with decision. The revolution or death! We have drawn the sword, let us cast away the scabbard. We have tried all means to redress our rights. We have tried persuasion—threats—entreaties—demands. We have tried reason — we have tried submission — we have tried peace. It was all in vain. And now we are up, and hurrah for war! for death! It is but once in a thousand years that a great people rise together to vindicate the dignity of the human race. When they do so, there is but one means—war! war! war! War against external, and yet more against internal foes. War with the sword and dagger—with the pike and cannon —with the lanterne and the guillotine—for the hour has come!” His voice broke into a hoarse shriek, which was caught up and echoed by the momentarily increasing crowd with a phrensy and delight. “The cabinet of Vienna,” continued the speaker, “have fifty thousand men in the Low Countries—six R 2 thousand are posted in the Bresgaw—thirty thousand are despatched from Bohemia. France is threatened with the fate of Poland. A Prussian army is at this instant upon her sacred territory, marching towards Paris—towards your homes, your wives, your children!” Claude's heart sunk in his bosom as he heard this high prophet of wo, and beheld the fearful power with which he lashed the passions of his auditors. “Who is the cause of this?” continued the speaker. “Behold yonder building! There lies the cause of all your oppressions. But for that, there would be bread and pleasures enough for all. The king—the queen—their family—their household! They are all joining with foreign foes to trample you into the dust. There is a great—great deed to be done! We must put our heel upon the vipers. The kings of Europe threaten us. Let us hold up to them, in answer, the head of a king!!!” It is impossible to paint the frantic and fierce delight with which this discourse was received by its terrible auditory. The orator beheld their delirium with a placid, good-humoured face and a gratified smile. His gestures were calm and almost dignified. He would have proceeded farther, but at this moment a company of the National Guard were observed to issue from a wing of the chateau, and to make their way at a rapid step towards the crowd. The commanding officer's voice could not be heard, but he motioned with his sword and addressed those within hearing, forming his company into three divisions, so as to present a formidable front of bristling muskets, which threatened to shower death upon the furious but imperfectly armed mob, who at first showed signs of determined resistance. “Not yet,” said the deep voice of the speaker, before he descended from his chair. “Go to your homes! Not yet, mes enfans! The hour is approaching, but it is not quite arrived.' Partly influenced by this caution, but probably in a much greater degree by the nearer sight of the troops, who, at the command of their officer, made ready and presented their muskets, the throngs opened and parted in every direction, dispersing into the adjoining streets and squares. They were followed by the soldiers, and cries of “Back! back! Fools! coquins! nigeauds! back!” and frequent blows with the flat blades of their swords hastened their retreat and added to the general confusion. Claude did not join this rabble in their flight, but remained, and was presently overtaken by a small company. “Have you a mind to a bullet for your supper, young man,” said the officer, “that you do not follow your companions?” “They are not my companions, sir,” said Claude; “my friends lie within yonder walls; and I'll make it worth your trouble if you'll help me to gain entrance into the chateau.” “How now, fool!” said the officer; “you must be mad, or worse, to think of such a thing; and if you wish not rather to take up your abode in less elegant lodgings, you'll keep away from this part of the town. Back! monsieur. Back! I say!” “I protest! I entreat! I will will give you any sum to carry a letter for me,” said Claude. “It is to a lady—one of the—” “Back!” said the officer; “he is mad or an assassin.” And, indeed, the earnestness and agitation of Claude's looks and gestures went far to sanction this opinion, which soon received a still stronger confirmation. The orator of the day, lurking behind a tree, was identified by a soldier as he who had just addressed the crowd. Two men were despatched to seize him. When they returned, all present seemed to recognise the person of the speaker. “What, George!” said the officer, with an expression of deep indignation, “is it you again at this work? Shame upon you. I have a mind to—to—” “To what?” said the giant, calmly. “To drag you to the dungeon which you and such as you deserve.” “And where have you walls thick enough to keep out those who would come to seek me?” demanded the stranger. “Parbleu!” said the young soldier, reddening with anger, “do you threaten one of his majesty's officers?” “Yes, threaten and defy him!” replied the stranger, sternly, and yet with a certain dignity. “Had I my will, I would put you in such a cell as would baffle all the bloodhounds who come at your call to get you out!” said the soldier. “It would be only by the hand of the executioner that I would have that rebellious head of yours shown to the people—as one day it will be, if I have any skill in prophecy.” “Dog of a hireling!” said the stranger, fiercely, “do you know that not only your head, but your master's, shall one day—” He was interrupted by a cry of fury from the soldiers; and the officer, himself apparently suffering rage for an instant to get the better of reason, with a deep execration, gave the word of command to his men, who scarcely waited for it; they levelled their muskets at the stranger, who, as if appalled at the consequences of his words, turned pale, and exhibited other signs of trepidation. The officer was in the act of pronouncing the word “Fire!” when Claude, with an irresistible impulse to save at any risk the shedding of human blood in cold cruelty, stepped actually before the levelled muskets, and entreated the amazed soldier to forbear. “For the love of Heaven, sir,” said he, “as you value the lives of the king and royal family, do not fire! One drop of blood at this moment will destroy the chateau and all its inhabitants, and drench Paris in blood.” “Eh! parbleu!” cried the officer, regarding this bold intrusion with irrepressible astonishment; “are you seeking a grave, that you put yourself before loaded muskets in that way? Had I but breathed a word, you would have been by this time in company with Cæsar. Is yon nigeaud your father, that you think his life worth so much more than your own?” “No, I do not know him,” replied Claude; “but I think your position requires prudence, and no blood should be spilled on the king's side. It would raze Paris to the ground.” “Well, well, you may be right! but, sacré diable! you're a bold ganache! Adieu, monsieur! and a word of advice. When next you meet a line of muskets levelled at a scélérat like this, after the words `make ready' and `take aim' have been uttered, don't be too ready to step before them. Every officer may not be as cool as I, and they might fire—eh! Ha! ha! ha! par Dieu! that's capital! Allons, messieurs!” The troops now drew together again, and, being formed into a single company by the principal officer, were wheeled round and marched back towards the chateau. “Bold friend!” said the Herculean stranger, drawing near, “you have saved my life. I may, perhaps, one day reciprocate the favour. Who are you?” “My name can be of little interest to you, monsieur,” said Claude, coolly. “Possibly! but it may be different with mine, in regard to yourself, young man. Therefore please to remember it, and, when you need aid—as doubtless you will, for the times are somewhat unsettled, and I think your tongue smacks of an accent not loved in Paris—call on me, and be assured I will not fail you. You have saved the life of Danton. I am to be heard of at the Jacobin. Au revoir! mon cher.” The stranger turned on his heel and walked hastily away.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XXV. All the efforts of Claude to gain an entrance into the chateau, or to obtain any communication with the inhabitants of it, were in vain. He was obliged to use the utmost caution in making the endeavour, and he more than once subjected himself to serious danger in the attempt. Some days passed away in this state of suspense, which grew every moment more awful. The most frightful reports were continually in circulation. It was said the town was to be sacked—there was to be a rising of the mob—the chateau was to be burned, and the royal family and household massacred. The tumult and alarm each day augmented. Some dreadful event was clearly impending. The crisis was at hand. It was on the afternoon before the memorable 10th of August, that, having snatched a hasty meal, and equipped himself, as every one else had done, with pistols and a sabre, Claude left his lodging with the full determination to make his way to the chateau, and to be first in the attack which, it was understood, was to be made upon it, so that, gaining entrance with the mob, he might seek and save Ida, if, indeed, she had not long since escaped from it. All his exertions could procure for him no other chance of admission. As he attempted to make his way towards the Tuileries, he found the streets thronged with crowds of the worst description. The shops were closed. Business was entirely abandoned. Only wild hordes of women and ruffians, whose actions gave evidences, not to be mistaken, of an immediate outbreak. It was late in the day when he left his lodgings, and the shadows of night soon descended upon one of the most frightful scenes recorded by history. The uproar increased, and, with feelings which we shall not undertake to depict, he perceived the tide set towards the chateau. Suddenly a tremendous pressure, in which some of the more feeble were trampled to death around him, required him to exert all his strength to escape the same fate. He succeeded with difficulty in mounting the steps of a church, and it would be difficult to describe the emotions with which, from this eminence, he beheld approaching, with that kind of solemn grandeur which always attends the exhibition of immense power, an organized body of about thirty thousand persons, consisting of the most desperate men and dissolute and frantic women—the mere refuse of human nature. Some children were distinguished in this formidable battalion, and, fearfully indicative of the extent of the revolutionary fury, many of the National Guards swelled the rank of the enemy they should have confronted. Few regular arms, however, were seen; but countless hands bore with a firm grasp whatever chance had thrown in their way—axes, poles, scythes, pitchforks, clubs, spears, and butcher's knives. Hundreds of torches threw a lurid glare upon the scene, rendering it at once more picturesque and awful; and, at short intervals of distance, and waved wildly in the smoky light, were lifted banners displaying inscriptions of the various revolutionary watchwords most in vogue, such as Down with the Veto! Death to the Austrian! Long live the Sans Culottes! The country in danger! and, The nation for ever! This dreadful army came up and passed on with a measured tread, that sounded like the rumbling of a volcano about to burst—the unbridled and clamorous fury of individual passion having subsided into a general current, more silent only because more deep. Suddenly they broke out, as if with a simultaneous impulse, into the chorus “ça-ira!” The blended voices of so many thousands—their irregular and terrible arms—their garb of rags, filth, and desperate wretchedness—their haggard and ferocious faces—and the deep, hollow tramp with which those determined feet—bent to the throne of their king—kept time to the music, made a scene which would have appalled a heart less stout than Claude's. It seemed, indeed, the whole nation gathered together in gigantic force, and rolling, in one stupendous billow, to sweep away the solid banks which had pent it up for ages. Different indeed were the feelings and intentions which animated Claude from those which, perhaps with scarcely a single exception, inspired the dreadful masses of desperate beings around him, and deep was the horror and disgust with which he beheld their slow, but determined, portentous advance; but he saw no other chance of effecting his purpose than joining their ranks, and accordingly he fell in, his drawn sabre in hand, and pursued his march. He well knew their path and his own were the same. In this way he succeeded in getting much nearer the scene where centred so many of his hopes and fears. It was his intention to follow this army of desperadoes to the very gate of the chateau; but an accident prevented him. A female, whose appearance was that of a fury, finding him in her way, suddenly thrust him violently forward, and on his turning to defend himself from the second blow, she raised a glittering knife, as if to anticipate his resentment by making the first fatal attack. In the astonishment excited by this incident, Claude's foot slipped, and he would have received, without being able to parry it, the descending stroke of this half-drunken pythoness, and fallen only to be trampled to death beneath the multitude, which no such trifle could an instant arrest in its course, when a third person extended his scythe so as to fend the thrust, and hastily, at the same time, reaching his hand, sustained him in a perpendicular position. There are kind hearts in the lowest scenes. He was, however, thus pressed out of the ranks, and, breathless and fatigued, he was obliged to rest among a group which, motionless itself, beheld this portentous tide flow by. The regiment from which he had been thus excluded passed on, and, unaccustomed as he was to such violent exercise, he was glad to stop a moment and recover breath. This terrible body had scarcely passed, when it was followed by several companies of grenadiers—and legions of licentious vagabonds, at first entirely without order or arms, but who received the latter as they proceeded from hands careful to supply them, without fee or question, wherever they were wanted. From these frightful crowds ever and anon rose a kind of half-chanted chorus, which had the most solemn and almost sublime effect, of “Bread! bread! bread!” Suddenly the deep report of a cannon sent an electric shock through the stormy sea of human beings heaving around. Then the drums beat far and wide the terrible générale, and from all quarters rose shouts, fierce and universal, “To the palace! To the palace!” This was the long-expected signal for the attack on the chateau. Claude—his blood boiling, his mind greatly excited by the scenes he had passed through—pressed his way on, resolved to reach the scene of the attack at any hazard, certain that, if these hellhounds forced admission into the royal residence, every member of the family would be instantly massacred, unless the friends of the king should have gathered around him, at this dark hour, in sufficient numbers to make a resistance, and should have foreseen the necessity of preparing in an adequate manner to defend their position. Bold and firm measures would certainly have afforded a hope of safety. The cool skill of a disciplined militia—a determined resistance—a resolution to defend the royal residence inch by inch, and to the last drop of blood, supported by even a tolerable force, might check the onset—give time for the royalists to rally around their sovereign, till the fickle multitude should abandon Vol. II.—S their bloody purpose. Had these requisite arrangements been made, Claude knew that every accession to the besieged would be of fearful importance, and that the fate of the contest might be turned even by a single arm. He pictured the unfortunate and excellent, but wavering, monarch and his beautiful queen awaiting in horror this appalling attack; and Ida, pale with terror, calling perhaps on him for aid, which she little dreamed he had thus promptly determined to offer. Deeply did he yearn, during that midnight march amid the most remorseless and bloodthirsty wretches that ever gathered to a scene of carnage and crime, to be planted in front of the almost defenceless circle which they were hastening to attack. No tempest-tossed mariner ever sighed more eagerly for land, than he for the moment when he might throw himself before the king and her who was now trembling at his side, and when he might oppose even his single breast to this awful danger. He had been denounced as a coward for shrinking from doing what he deemed wrong, and he could be driven neither by anger nor false shame to violate his principle, and to break the law of man and God. Among those who sneered at and despised him, was there one heart that would have remained more unappalled in this scene? one foot that would have more steadily pursued its way where humanity, chivalry, and love called him? After breathing a few moments, and feeling that his arms were safe, his pistols firm in his girdle, and his poniard in his bosom, grasping his sword with a prayer to Heaven for success, he stepped from his resting-place, and committed himself once more to the swift current which rushed towards the fated chateau. He soon found that his principal danger lay in the effect of the now momentarily increasing excitement of the scene upon his mind. He could scarcely restrain his disgust and indignation within the bounds of prudence, or wait the proper moment to strike a blow in defence of the weaker party. It was only the image of Ida—pale—pursued perhaps by ruffians, and consigned to dangers too horrible to dwell on—that gave him power to govern the impetuosity of his soul—to repress his mounting passions, and to check the arm that longed to deal death among the fierce and brutal wretches who howled around him for the blood of the noble, the innocent, and helpless. But for long habits of self-control, he would probably have here sacrificed his life at once, without the slightest advantage to the cause he espoused. Guarding himself with a powerful effort from a premature discovery of his intention, and making his way on and on with unwavering perseverance and the most unshrinking disregard of such dangers as could not be avoided, he struck through the masses of the tumultuous rabble, who, supposing that the tall and determined man—grasping his sabre as one who meant to use it well, and advancing through all obstacles with such a reckless energy—was one of those acting as their leaders, made way for him on every side. His form, indeed, was one that commanded attention. His hat had long since fallen. His hair was streaming wildly about his head, and the deep emotion of his soul had imparted to his demeanour a commanding dignity, and to his face a sternness, for which he had been in some degree remarked even in the glittering scenes of fashion, but which at this hour spoke like one born to command, and whom it was not safe to resist. Yes, he who had been able to endure a blow, and all its humiliating consequences, rather than violate a principle, now disclosed, perhaps half unexpectedly to himself, the soul of a hero—cool and self-governed in the midst of such shocking and perilous scenes as the world have rarely witnessed, without a shudder at the death-shrieks which often arose around him—now of some wretch suspended to a lamp-post at his side, now the wild cry of some woman fainting and trampled to a shapeless clod beneath his feet—and without the slightest disturbance of his calmness, although pressing on and on amid weapons which he knew must be presently directed against himself, and expecting each instant as he advanced— hoping, indeed—to be rewarded by a discharge of cannon—which might rake the narrow and crowded streets from end to end, and greet the besiegers with such a reception as they deserved. He felt his soul exalted with emotions never known before. He grew more and more calm and resolute, and deeper and deeper every moment grew the burning impatience of his soul, to find the occasion when he might abandon the ranks of his bloodthirsty companions, and, throwing himself by the side of the other party—of Ida, perhaps—aid in checking the attack, or yield his life in the attempt. But alas! one individual in a scene like this is but an atom; and, the nearer he approached the central scene, the more he was hemmed in, and deprived of power over his own motions. He was borne slowly onward, as a plank upon the billows; and, long before he came in sight of the Tuileries, in an agony of suspense to know whether any attack could have been made already, without, perhaps, any defence, the morning had filled the east, and the smoky flambeaux began to grow pale before her pure light. At length he reached a point whence the chateau was visible; and he perceived, with inexpressible exultation, not only that the attack had not commenced, but that it was to be met with a manly defence. Battallions of the National Guard were marched up to the chateau. The gend'armerie followed on horseback. Various appearances indicated that the besieged had not abandoned hope; and that the besiegers, great as were their strength and numbers, would not advance farther on their enterprise without some hesitation. On looking in another direction, however, it was seen that the insurgents were swelled each hour by new accessions, and were steadily advancing in several columns. Even while Claude reconnoitred them, a large body of the wildest rabble—who had just forced the arsenal, and thus completely equipped themselves with arms—approached in regular order, showing that they were acting under cool and able leaders. They were received with reiterated shouts of triumph. They were followed almost immediately by another column fifteen or twenty thousand strong, and then by another of equal force. As the strength of the assailants received their augmentations, the air was rent with universal bursts of triumph, in which the name of each body was the burden, “Hurrah! Victory! The faubourg St. Antoine! The faubourg St. Marceau!!!” And now the assailants were drawn up in the order in which they were to advance to the attack. The clamour of the crowd for a moment abated before the intense interest of the scene. A burst of music was heard. A company of the Marsellaise moved forward in perfect order. Claude had placed himself as near the front ranks as he could get—a position for him of double peril; for, while he thus exposed himself to the fire of the besieged, he ran the hazard of being cut down or shot by his own party the instant he should discover his intention of joining their victims. The guards of the palace appeared crowded at the doors and windows. The assailants advanced at first with some show of order. Suddenly a single musket fired from a window laid the man next to Claude dead beneath his feet. A general discharge followed instantly from both sides, and then all was smoke—crash—fire —shrieks—shouts — thunder, and such confusion as rendered it almost impossible to know in which direction lay the chateau. His ears were deafened—his clothes blackened and burnt—a ball had passed through his sleeve, and he had a slight cut upon the arm, which he only knew some time afterward by the sight of the flowing blood. Borne, as a struggling sailor in a shipwreck, by the waves, he found himself at length, with a firm footing, immediately before the palace. His heart leaped to perceive that he was among the first. There were heavy blows, and crash after crash, and peals of S 2 cannon shook the earth, and the bullets whizzed close to his head. As the breeze blew away the smoke, he perceived that he was in the midst of the maddened soldiery, doing their dreadful work upon the poor Swiss, who, fighting to the last, yielded their bosoms and their throats to each red and ruthless hand. He threw himself into the midst of them to save a poor fellow who was set on by four or five ruffians, and who fought like a lion. Claude rushed to his side. The impulse which seized him was irresistible as madness. He fired, and the foremost of the assailants fell. It was the first time he had ever taken human life, and he experienced a thrill as the poor wretch tumbled back and the blood gushed from his head and nostrils; but there was no compunction in his feelings, and the next assailant shared the same fate. The poor Swiss thus supported, escaped for the time at least; but a cloud of smoke from a cannon discharged at their side, and a rush of the assailants into the grand hall, separated him from the person he had saved, luckily hid his interference from general notice, and enabled him to reach the interior of the palace. And now, with a trembling heart, he forced his way in at the head of the troops, as if he had been their leader. He cast his eyes around. The halls, slippery with blood, were already yielding to the work of destruction. He mounted the broad stairs — he flew breathless through the gorgeous halls—he sought in every chamber, with the expectation of beholding the royal circle surrounded by their last defenders, and ready to be slaughtered. He had made up his mind, in such a case, to fling himself into the midst of them, and share their fate, whatever it might be. At his heels were a thousand ruffians—their drawn swords red and dripping—their hoarse screams resounding “the king! the king!” At length they were met by another party, who had conducted the search with a better knowledge of the localities, and who were headed by a fierce young man, whose actions were those of a maniac. “Sacré dia ble!” cried he, “they are gone. The birds have flown!” The intelligence was received with a storm of oaths and maledictions by all but Claude, who heard it with an exultation which almost deprived him of prudence. It was with difficulty he restrained himself from uttering a shout of triumph which would have betrayed him to his rough associates. “Mais n'importe!” cried the voice of the young leader; “nous y reviendrons![2] [2] An historical fact. We shall come here again.” “Oh, save me! save me!” cried a voice husky with terror, and one of the unhappy Swiss, whose companions had been all massacred, pursued by a band of butchers, rushed through the crowd. He traversed the hall with steps winged with terror, and escaped through an opposite door. All joined in the pursuit. It resembled the violent phrensy of a pack of hounds after a deer. The poor youth, better acquainted than his pursuers with the localities of the chateau, succeeded in eluding their grasp till he descended into the lower apartments and offices of that huge edifice. Here he reached the royal kitchen, with the whole yelling crew at his heels. An enormous fire, as if the royal family had expected to enjoy their dinner that day as usual, was blazing on the hearth. He sank exhausted to the floor, and was instantly seized. “To the roof—to the roof—hurl him off!” cried a cracked female voice. “No—the hook, the hook!” exclaimed others, pointing to a large hook in the ceiling; and several eager hands had already thrown over it a cord which hung dangling in the air. “The fire!” shrieked a brawny woman, her eyes glittering with the light of intoxication, if not of madness. The last proposal was received with frantic delight, and immediately acted on. The victim was grasped by a dozen fierce hands, and bound with the cord which was to have been used in strangling him. Claude turned to escape the sight of what he could not prevent, and, as he hastened away, he heard the plunge and sudden shriek of the desperate wretch, the crackling of the sparks and flames, and the hoarse yells of the barbarian executioners. A scream in an adjoining corridor, sounding above all the roar and tumult of the palace, now called his attention in a new direction; and, with considerable surprise, he saw several females in the last state of terror, pursued by a rabble who threatened to sacrifice them as the poor Swiss had been sacrificed before. A man had even seized the arm of one of the trembling fugitives, who, by their attire and appearance, seemed of superior rank. His trembling eagerness scarcely permitted him to examine whether Ida might not be among them, though he had persuaded himself of her escape with the queen. The defenceless victim sank upon her knee, and lifted her hands as if yielding to death. Of all the sensations which a human being can experience, perhaps that of Claude was the most singular mixture of delight and horror, on recognising in the uplifted face of the unhappy being the features of Ida. He advanced with the intention of striking dead the ruffian who still dragged his victim by the arm. But the habit of self-control here again came to his aid; for, instead of cutting down the man, which would have been the signal for an instant slaughter of himself and those he wished to defend, he seized his throat with a giant's grasp, and hurled him back against the wall. “She is a woman!” cried he, in a voice so stern that for a moment the wretch paused in fear. The wild scream which Ida uttered on recognising him, and the joy and confidence with which she clung to his arm and to his bosom, almost unnerved him for the crisis in which he found himself. “A woman!” cried the man; “what of that? She is my prisoner. Stand back!” and he lifted the scythe-blade which he held in his hand aloft in the air with gesticulations of fury. Claude drew a pistol silently but firmly. “A bas les aristocrats!” cried the wretch, and started forward to cut him down. There was no longer time for delay. Claude fired. The ball passed through the assailant's brain. For a moment the commanding attitude and stern voice of him who had so boldly interfered between the lion and his wrath, arrested the party. “What! don't you know me?” exclaimed Claude. “I am your leader. I was the first to mount the tyrant's steps. Had he been here, you should strike and spare not; but we shall not commence our cause by butchering women. Back, I say, and let us send them in safety away.” “He's right,” cried two or three voices. “He was the first in,” said another. “Then I demand a guard for these miserable women, who are not worth your rage,” said Claude. “Go, my friends, seek more worthy game.” The young man who had made himself so conspicuous, and whose voice had first announced the escape of the royal family, here came in with some of the National Guard. “Women?” said he; “they must be removed.” “I demand a guard to take them to a place of safety,” said Claude. “You are right, stranger,” said Lazarre. “Antoine”—he turned to one of the regular soldiers—“take twenty men and conduct these women to the next guardhouse.” The soldier obeyed. The rabble made way. The females were surrounded by their escort and marched out of the palace.[3] [3] A fact. The trembling Ida was rather borne than led by Claude, whose brain reeled with a joy too sweet to be certain, as he found himself under the protection of the guard, completely disentangled from the immense multitudes which now surrounded the palace, but which grew less dense at every step of their retreat, till they were far removed from the scene of action, and paused in the comparative safety of a distant and narrow street. Claude here conferred with the officer, who promised faithfully to take each one of his affrighted charge wherever they wished to go. For himself, he was in the neighbourhood of the section du Theatre Français. Ida, from the revulsion of feeling, and the fatigue and danger of the previous night, was almost unable to support herself. Bearing, therefore, her light form upon his arm, which thrilled beneath the beloved burden, he speedily reached his hotel, gained his room, and deposited her upon a sofa. A maid attended at his request. She was, by a fortunate chance, a modest and kind-hearted girl, entirely untouched with the revolutionary mania. Annette, her eyes bathed with tears, offered to become, through every danger, a constant and devoted attendant of the lovely young stranger thus unexpectedly committed to her care, and instantly commenced her duties. We must beg the reader to paint, according to his own imagination, the scene which took place when Ida recovered her senses. All that sensibility and delicacy could require or bestow, marked every moment of their interview, while they hastily interchanged such particulars as were most requisite to a mutual understanding of their present position and prospects, although Claude carefully avoided revealing the great change which had taken place in his fortune, and of which Ida knew nothing. That they should quit France instantly was of course desirable; but Carolan was in prison, and Ida would not desert him. In vain Claude begged her to go herself to the frontier, with the means which he hoped to be able to supply for her journey, promising to remain, and do all in his power to procure the count's liberation. She firmly refused to set off without her father. Whatever sentiment might have been felt of that passion which had been revealed to each other without words, and so long cherished without hope, at this instant it gave way to the more pressing thought of escape for themselves, and the means of rescuing Carolan. “Trust to me,” said Claude. “Remain where you are; if Annette will but be faithful—” “Oh, for ever!” said the warm-hearted girl, her eyes filling with tears. “I will never abandon Mademoiselle Carolan as long as I live.” “I will consent not to leave Paris, then, till we rescue your father.” In this time, when so much prudence and courage were necessary, Claude appeared more calm and noble than Ida had ever seen him before. Even through the mean, torn, and dirty dress which he had assumed, his air was so free and commanding, his face so full of manly beauty, that, little knowing the change which had occurred in his condition, she innocently felt that her happiness depended on him, and that he was the only being who could ever possess her love. In the mean time, he placed a purse in Annette's hands, requesting her to order everything necessary to the security and comfort of her young mistress; and Annette was a femme de chambre whose genius could have ministered to the wants of a princess, and surrounded her with such cares as only a French femme de chambre had any idea of. She was as good-humoured as she was adroit and intelligent; and it seemed as if Heaven had sent, in the last moment of danger, this invaluable aid, as a token that the little party, beset as they were by perils, were not to be deserted.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XXVI. With the deepest anxiety that had ever winged his steps, Claude left Ida to the charge of Annette, and flew again to La Tour for advice and assistance in the singular situation in which he now found himself. La Tour was more alarmed, more wavering than before. He was almost resolved upon flight himself; but eyes were upon him, as he well knew, which would detect his first motion towards such a measure. Danger makes us selfish. He could but advise Claude to fly with his new companion, and to take his chance for getting out of France. As for Carolan, he assured him that the only consequences which would follow an attempt in his favour would be the arrest, and perhaps the destruction, of those who should make it. Disappointed in the succour—which, indeed, he scarcely expected—from La Tour, Claude next proceeded to the person whose address he had procured from James, and who had been recommended as one so able, from various circumstances, to afford him aid in an emergency like the present. Ida had already informed him that her uncle, Colonel St. Marie, was still at his chateau a few leagues from Paris, and that, if she could reach it, she would there take up her abode, and consider the best means of rescuing her father from his unhappy and perilous situation. By the aid of the person alluded to, measures were arranged for their immediate departure, and the next day they succeeded in escaping safely out of Paris, and in reaching the Chateau St. Marie. We will not detain the reader with the various hopes, fears, and emotions which animated each of the little party who, thus removed from the immediate scene of action, here debated upon the means of Carolan's deliverance and their subsequent flight out of France. Claude was often in Paris, where he beheld scenes of which the reader would scarcely wish to hear the dark and bloody details. But, notwithstanding his exertions, he could not succeed in gaining admission to Carolan, or learning more of his fate than that he was in the Conciergerie, and was not likely to be released. The frightful massacre of the first, second, and third of September—the formal commencement of the Republic—the opening of the National Convention—the execution of the king, of the queen, and many more of the horrors of that remarkable period, took place; while Ida, sheltered in the chateau of her uncle, and kept, as far as was possible, in ignorance of the scenes around her, waited, with an anxiety which preyed upon her health, the dreadful course of events, till some vicissitude should either deprive her of a father whom, with all his eccentricities, she deeply loved, or should return him to her arms. Indeed, the sources of her anguish were numerous as well as profound. She had heard but indirectly from her mother, till Claude, by the arrangements which he had made with James, opened a new and more certain mode of communication. But, alas! it rather added to her grief, for she learned that her mother was dangerously ill from the effects of the agonizing suspense into which the peril of the count and Ida had thrown her. Several months passed away, and, notwithstanding the exertions of Claude, without producing any event favourable to his wishes. The whole time was by no means spent by him at the chateau. He was sometimes weeks together at Paris — mingling with the mobs—shouting the cant watchwords—attending the tribunals, and playing the rôle of a zealous revolutionist. In the course of the various enterprises to learn the details of Carolan's present situation, he had made several attempts to see Danton, whose life he had saved, and whose real character and influence he had now learned better to appreciate. The faithful agent and ally supplied by James at length aided him in Vol. II.—T presenting the affair in such a light to Danton, that that terrible arbiter of life began to listen to the propositions of a pecuniary nature which, as the time advanced and the danger grew more perilous, began to be large enough to tempt the cupidity of a much more scrupulous magistrate. It was with feelings of such gratification as he had rarely experienced, that Claude was one day returning from Paris to the chateau St. Marie, after having nearly brought these negotiations to a conclusion, when, being almost arrived, he was alarmed by the sound of horse's feet, and a body of troops overtook him on their way to join the army of the Alps. It was about noon, and the towers of the chateau were just visible at a little distance from the road. At the sight of them the colonel ordered a halt. Claude had succeeded in hiding himself amid some thick shrubbery, in such a way that he could, without being seen, overhear the conversation. From this place of concealment he perceived that a peasant had been arrested and brought before the commander, who put several inquiries to him respecting the chateau and its occupants. The replies were of a nature to awaken considerable alarm. The man questioned was a bigoted Jacobin; and, whether from party zeal, private enmity, or the mere desire to behold a scene of carnage and plunder, related many particulars, which aroused the fury of the colonel, who seemed to be a low, coarse man, with that determined bent towards cruelty which marked so many minds during this period. The sum of the information thus received was, that the owner of the chateau was a royalist; that he had a brother, who was not only a rank aristocrat, but a Prussian nobleman; that the latter had come into France with the avowed intention of aiding the royal cause, in consequence of which he had been imprisoned, and was either beheaded or was awaiting execution; that the present occupant of the chateau was also an officer of decidedly royal sentiments, and that he was waiting to emigrate only till he should ascertain whether the brother could be saved. The informant added, that the daughter of the imprisoned Prussian was also a resident of the chateau, and that she was a very beautiful girl, who refused to quit France from fidelity to her father; and that there was an English spy, also in the habit of remaining much with the family, although disguised under the character of a revolutionist. Claude heard, with as much astonishment as alarm, these and many other particulars related of himself and the precious charge over whose safety he had watched with so much care, some of which could only have been ascertained by a system of espionage which he had too carelessly concluded he had escaped. “The sacré aristocrat!” then demanded Colonel Dubois, “has taken no part in the revolution?” “No, citizen colonel,” replied the peasant; “they are determined to emigrate as soon as the proper time comes.” “That they never shall,” said the colonel. “What say you, my brave fellows? For us or against us is our motto; these are traitors. Shall we down with the old crow's nest about their ears?” An enthusiastic shout announced the delight with which this proposition was received by the licentious troops; for, notwithstanding the victorious career of the French armies under the Republic, they frequently interrupted their march to indulge in excesses characteristic rather of undisciplined banditti than of regular troops. A short council was immediately called, consisting of two or three of the officers, of which Claude did not wait to hear the result. He crept from the thicket, which fortunately led through a narrow lane shaded with trees and bushes in such a way as to conceal him from the view of the soldiery, who were, moreover, too expectant of the orders of their chief and of their anticipated booty to regard his motions. Following, therefore, the path, which lay in a direct line to it, he reached the chateau, breathless, covered with dust, and pale with the terror which the incident had conjured up. His sudden appearance and agitation at once announced that he was the messenger of evil. Colonel St. Marie had been asleep upon a sofa, and Ida was sitting by his side lost in thought. They both started up and heard with inexpressible terror the danger which was approaching. St. Marie, although superannuated and scarcely able to walk, rose with an indignation which for a moment recalled the strength of youth to his limbs. The domestics were instantly collected, and preparations for defence were commenced. He called for his arms, and gave twenty different orders in the same minute. Three or four bewildered serving-men, incapable of rendering aid, even had there been any chance of defence, ran to and fro, scarcely knowing what they did; and St. Marie, even while grasping his sword with one trembling hand and a pistol with the other, as if determined himself to confront the ruffians who threatened him, sank back exhausted into a fauteuil, and his weapons fell from his nerveless grasp. “Ida,” said St. Marie, “you must fly. Wyndham, it is to you alone I dare intrust her. I know not which of the servants, if any, are worthy of confidence. One mile back through the wood is the hut of Susanne, an old family nurse, who has a certain place of concealment. I will never leave my hearthstone for these recreants. Do not seek to persuade me. This man,” he added, pointing to the trembling old domestic who supported his feeble steps, “is the only one in the family who knows it besides myself. I will call the others in, and they shall not see the road you take. Fly. I commit her to your care.” “My beloved uncle—my father! Oh, merciful Heaven! preserve me,” murmured Ida, fainting with terror. “Do you fear to accompany him, my child?” demanded the old man. “Oh, no, no!” cried Ida; “but come with us, my uncle!” “Never.” “Then I will not desert you—” “I command you, Ida. Your presence here will make things worse.” “These are dangers,” said Claude, “which make flight imperative—for you, monsieur, as well as for her. Your age—your—” “Never. I have never fled from the enemies of France; shall I fly from her children? Never. I will receive these rude visiters in my hall as becomes a host. I will retain them if I can—at least till you are out of their reach. I will—Hark! Ida! sweet child! away.” They embraced as those embrace who may never meet again. The trumpet sounded a blast almost under the window. There was a trampling of horses' feet upon the stone pavement of the court, and three hoarse cheers announced the numbers and the spirit of the new-comers. Claude led his affrighted companion, with gentle force, from the arms of the high-hearted old man, and withdrew, tenderly sustaining her hasty and faltering steps. He thought himself the sport of some wild dream. He passed hastily through the gate. One of the soldiers, by the precaution of the enemy, had been already planted there. His glittering bayonet arrested them, and he levelled his musket. “No, my fair friend!” cried he, laughing, “you are just the one we want. “Back! Back, I say! Ha, cochon!” he continued, as Claude raised a pistol. He accompanied the last exclamation by discharging his musket; but, before he had time to bring it to a correct aim—before even the words had fairly left his lips, the ball, winged from the rapid hand of Claude, laid him dead upon the grass. The contents of his musket spent themselves harmlessly in the air. A wild shout from the house winged Claude's feet with yet new swiftness; and, lifting Ida upon his arm, he gained a thick grove T 2 within a few yards of the wall, just as a crowd of shouting ruffians turned the angle of the building, which, indeed, was already a scene of shrieks, tumult, and uproar. Completely sheltered by the bowers of the tangled wood, he fled hastily with his beloved burden. It was not long, however, when, by the increased weight upon his arm, he perceived that he bore a senseless form. He stooped to gaze upon that face, the image of so many a delicious dream, and a thousand times more beautiful in reality even than in imagination. He bathed her pale temples and closed eyes with water from a spring, that gushed from the rock against which he leaned, and, with a tremour at his heart such as he had never known before, he measured her beautiful, senseless form with fearful eyes, to assure himself that the ball of the ruffian who had fired at them had not marred the fairest mortal that ever came from the hand of nature. Terrified, yet dazzled—enraptured, yet in despair—a tenderness, which would have made him too happy to lay down his life for her, entered yet more deeply into his soul. With inexpressible rapture he perceived that she was not wounded, and that she already began to give signs of life. Her head hung back upon his arm—upon his bosom. Her eyes opened. Her mouth almost touched his own. He felt her fragrant breath upon his cheek. At this moment he would have forgotten the danger which surrounded him had his own life alone been at stake. The obstacles to his union with Ida were removed; and her whole demeanour towards him during the time which had elapsed since their meeting in Paris, had filled his heart with new fervour, while it inspired his mind with deeper respect. Both seemed to feel that, amid the dreadful events going on around them, and in which they themselves were so deeply interested, any formal expression of their own sentiments would be out of place. The language of both, therefore, had been only that of a friendship full of tender confidence and deep happiness, strangely mingled with apprehension and anguish. But now, with the object of his long-cherished love thus committed to his single care—thus abandoned to himself alone — thus beautiful — thus clinging to his bosom, amid the bowers of a wood hidden from every eye— he could scarcely avoid flinging himself at her feet, and declaring the passion which inspired him. But the poor girl did not participate in his forgetfulness of danger, although her very terror unconsciously betrayed the love with which she had long regarded him. As he sustained her trembling form with the delicacy of a brother, feeling that even to die for a being so dear was a greater happiness than had ever before been allotted to his dark and lonely life, he saw enough in the unguarded tenderness and dependance, which even her fear and grief betrayed, to swell his breast with rapture, that rendered him, as far as regarded his own safety, totally regardless of the tempest around. “Do not fear,” he cried; “no peril shall reach you, dearest, beloved girl.” A shout again came from the chateau. “My uncle—my father! Oh, save me! save me!” she murmured, sinking from mingled fear and affection upon his bosom. With a Herculean arm he lifted her once more, and did not pause again till he reached the hut of old Susanne.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XXVII. Near the hut of Susanne was a subterranean passage, in former times connected with the chateau. It communicated with a rude outhouse, which had been used for some mysterious purpose, of which the tradition was lost. This retreat was known only to three persons in the family of St. Marie—himself, Susanne, and one of his oldest and most faithful serving-men. It was in order to procure to Ida the advantage of this place of security that he had sent her to Susanne, unwilling to trust the secret to any other of the servants on an occasion where there might be so many temptations to betray it. With hasty and trembling steps the two females took their place in this passage, of which the opening could not be discovered without the treachery of some one possessed of the secret. Leaving Ida here in comparative safety, Claude determined not to remain with them, but to reconnoitre from a distant position, and to defend it from any one who might by chance approach it. He therefore selected a spot where he thought he would be concealed, and remained, with emotions of mixed agony and happiness, to await the events of this interesting day. He could see the towers of the chateau, and, before an hour had elapsed, he beheld their tops surrounded with masses of smoke—a sad token of the work of destruction going on beneath. Off his guard, he gazed at this ominous sign with so much attention, that he did not observe the approach of four soldiers till they were so near that they discovered him. He had one loaded pistol. His enemies were completely armed. His first impulse was to sell his life dearly; but he reflected that resistance was certain death, while submission afforded at least a chance of safety. He yielded, therefore, with readiness, and was instantly conducted back to the chateau. It was with some difficulty that he could repress an exclamation of horror at the sight which met his view on arriving there. The large saloon was filled with a clamorous and half-drunken band of soldiers, seated at the tables, having finished an ample feast. The servants were bound and ranged against the wall. Several of them were females. Colonel St. Marie himself stood also bound in the midst of them, his face and dress stained with blood from a wound on his head. The ruin of the interior of the chateau was nearly accomplished. The costly furniture was scattered around in fragments, having been wantonly broken with axes and pikes. All that was portable and valuable was stowed away in sacks and wagons. Mirrors had been dashed to atoms; statues, clocks, candelabras, chandeliers, shattered; and invaluable paintings and rich old tapestry cut to pieces with sabres and bayonets. Everything which could be discovered in the building had been brought forth to supply the demands of five hundred voracious soldiers; and whole pipes of choice wine had been dragged from the cellar, and had been already so far exhausted by the brutal guests, that a general excitement, not far from actual intoxication, had reduced them from the appearance of troops with at least some claims to discipline, to little better than a mob of drunken robbers and cutthroats. Money and plate had been grasped by greedy hands, and were piled up in baskets preparatory to being packed; and several attempts had been made to set fire to the chateau, one of which seemed likely to be successful, for in an adjoining room the flames were slowly advancing, and emitted volumes of smoke—what Claude had already perceived at a distance. The feast was now done, and the men had risen and were standing erect as well as they could. The colonel fixed himself in his seat with a magisterial air, and, slapping his hand furiously down upon the table till he made the plates and glasses ring again, commanded order. “Citizen-soldiers!” said this man, with a drunken hiccough, “you have done well. You have done your duty. We have already the benefit arising from clearing France of these vile aristocrats. They must be swept off the face of the earth like so many reptiles. The population is to be reduced one fourth. Had I been consulted, it should have been one half. Then there should be bread and wine, and land and gold for the remainder. Then there would be no more prisons —no more starvation—no more oppression—no more jails. All would be free, happy, and rich. It is these drones, who eat the fat of the land and do nothing— these ruthless tyrants, who have trampled on you for so many years—who have caused all the wretchedness of poor France. It is decided that her population must be diminished. Our glorious Danton—our wise and patriotic Robespierre, have pointed out the way. We have fired this old den of aristocrats—you may hear the roaring of the flames. As for the brood of vipers who have nestled here, their doom is sealed. They must (hiccough) die. They hate our glorious revolution, and they must die, I say.” This discourse was delivered with a drunken energy, which was often interrupted by the inability of the speaker to proceed from mere intoxication, but yet more by the coarse and exulting cheers of the brutal auditory, and the groans and shrieks of the victims. These unhappy beings—a few hours before in the full enjoyment of life and hope—thus suddenly brought upon the brink of eternity, manifested in various ways their horror and despair. Some shrieked aloud—some wept—some clasped their hands in silent horror, and some in pious prayer. St. Marie himself—his eyes flashing with horror and rage—addressed the wretch who sat thus in bloody judgment over him in terms of dignified remonstrance. But all were alike in vain.[4] [4] Many a similar scene had been already acted in France. Let it not be supposed that the writer is drawing an exaggerated picture from imagination. He copies from historical records; and they who, in England, or France, or any other country, are so eager to raise the banner of revolution, should their rash design prove successful, would behold equally awful outrages. “Company, attention,” cried Col. Dubois; and for a moment the rolling of the drums drowned all other noises. “Bring out the prisoners.” They were thrust rudely forward in front of the chair where the ruffian sat with a magisterial air, his eye glassy with wine and that appalling desire to glut his sight with human blood, which seemed then an epidemic in France. “Here is another prisoner, citizen colonel,” said one of the soldiers; and Claude was thrust roughly into the middle of the floor. At the sight of him there was a comparative silence among even the rude soldiery, as if they felt a new interest in the drama. “Who are you?” demanded the colonel. “I am a teacher of languages,” said Claude, firmly and boldly. “I fled from Berlin to join the revolutionists. I am at a loss to know why these men have confounded me with the enemies of France.” “Were you known to any one as a friend to the revolution?” “Yes, to Danton!” “He is the spy—the English spy,” said the peasant who had given the information which led to the attack. “You are greatly mistaken,” said Claude, composedly; “I am so far from being a spy, that I was the first to enter the Tuileries on the glorious tenth of August. I was the first to enter the tyrant's palace.” “Humph!” said the colonel. “That is easily said, but not so easily proved. The first to enter the tyrant's palace! Liar! you shall confront him who was the first, for he is an officer in our company. Here, come forward,” he cried, beckoning to a person at the other end of the hall. A wild-looking young man, with long hair streaming about his face, and piercing black eyes, stepped forward at the call. Claude recognised him in a moment as the young leader on that bloody day who had been so near him. “If this man recognise you,” said the colonel, “you shall go free; if not, you die on the spot for a liar and an aristocrat. Hey, my brave boys! is not this Solomon's decision?” And he laughed triumphantly at the certainty which he presumed he had now established of convicting his prisoner in this summary way. “It is hardly fair,” said Claude; “but, to show you how sure I am, and how little I fear any harm from these my comrades in the great cause, citizen colonel, I accept the offer.” “Look at him, then,” said the colonel. Lazarre fixed his bright black eyes upon him, measured him with his glances from head to foot, and said, “No—I never saw him. He is an impostor.” “But I saw you,” said Claude, calmly; “and I will convince you you also saw me.” “If you did,” said the stranger, haughtily, “you would know my name. It was sounded that day by mouths enough.” “You were called Lazarre,” said Claude. “You mounted the great stairs waving a banner, on which was inscribed, `Down with the Veto!' You shot a Swiss at the entrance.” “Flying?” “No—in his box. Behind you were borne three heads on a pike; and when we learned the flight of the tyrant, you exclaimed, `N'importe, mes amis; nous y reviendrons!' In the kitchen you—that is, we— threw a fugitive into the flames.” “By Gracchus! did we not?” said Lazarre, extending his hand. “Not a hair of your head shall be touched.” “And it is hard, after being foremost in tearing down the tyrant's throne—in ridding the nation of her oppressors—to find myself counted among them,” said Claude, in a surly tone, and with a frown of anger at Colonel Dubois. “Ha! get back, then, citizen, in God's name,” said the colonel, as Lazarre again greeted him with a friendly welcome. “As for you—coquins! nigeauds! co chons!” cried the colonel, addressing the rest of the prisoners, “look your last on the light of day. The enemies of France must fall! Revenge (hiccough) revenge is the order of the day. You're rebels! (hiccough) you're aristocrats! (hiccough) and ye must die! Silence, I say,” cried he, as the voices of the prisoners burst forth, some in supplication, some in threats. “There is one chance for you; a woman— a girl, parbleu! — has escaped us, and is concealed somewhere, as I am informed, in or about this chateau. He or she among you who will tell me where she is hidden, shall receive his life as a reward; for the rest—Sergeant Gregoire, lead your prisoners into the court. Choose a file of twenty men, the least drunk among ye, and make short work of them, for we must be on our journey. Hark ye, wretches—I give you one minute—which of you will tell me where this young breeder of rebels and aristocrats is?” There were seven among the prisoners. Of them St. Marie and one servant alone knew Ida's place of concealment. The latter had heard the order which St. Marie had given, but he remained pale and motionless. Claude believed that all this brutal parade was but a mode of tempting those who knew the secret into a confession. “Allons, messieurs!” said Dubois; “you have ten seconds. By Brutus! I am in earnest.” “You cannot—you dare not—” cried St. Marie. “Ah! old coquin, that is your opinion!” “In the name of humanity—of France—” cried St. Marie. “Sergeant Gregoire,” said the colonel, “the time has expired. Forward, and do your duty.” The sergeant advanced. He had placed himself at the head of twenty men, who, with their charged bayonets, compelled the prisoners to proceed. Claude caught one agonized glance from St. Marie. At the Vol. II.—U door one man stopped and cried aloud for mercy. It was the old servant who alone possessed the secret. “Lache!” cried St. Marie. “Stop,” cried the man, “I will reveal—I will—I will—” and he fell upon his knees in the last paroxysm of terror. “Speak out, then, reptile,” thundered Dubois. “I will—I will—” gasped the trembling old man, nearly insensible with terror; “she—she—I cannot— I am choked!” “And may God's curse fall on him,” cried St. Marie, with a voice so deep and stern, that, for a moment, it awed even the half-drunken wretch himself who presided over this diabolical scene—“may God's curse light on him who, to save his miserable life, commits my sweet child to the grasp of these hellhounds—the curse of God—a dying man calls it down upon him and his for ever!” “I cannot help it,” gasped the man; “give me life, and I care not. She—she is hidden in—” All leaned forward with increasing interest to catch the words from his pale and quivering lips. St. Marie struggled to spring upon him. He was bound, and held by two strong men. But the speaker's voice was stopped by another hand. A bullet from the remaining pistol of Claude, which he had carefully concealed in his bosom, lodged in the temples of the unhappy wretch. He fell back dead without a groan. St. Marie gave a shout of triumph, and a wild yell of fury burst from the throng, who threw themselves upon Claude, with their muskets and sabres in hand, to cut him to pieces.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XXVIII. At the tumult which followed this bold act, Claude believed his last moment had come. He was seized by a dozen brawny hands, sabres flashed and clashed before his eyes, and he was borne to the floor, and had scarcely time to commit himself to the mercy of his Creator, ere he felt two bullets whiz past his head, and a sword pass through his body. The next instant would have terminated his existence had not Colonel Dubois himself interfered. His deep, coarse voice, in tones of thunder, demanded order, and his gigantic arm rescued his victim from immediate destruction, in order to succeed, if possible, in tearing the secret from him before his death. It was after much discord and struggling that the commander succeeded in forming his men once more in a kind of order, and he instantly proceeded to question Claude. Accounts of the beauty of the young girl who had escaped him had excited his curiosity and inflamed his imagination, and he resolved to secure her at any rate. The continual return of the men who had been sent in search of her without having accomplished their object, yet farther aroused his passion. “So, friend, you know the secret hiding-place, then?” said he, as Claude, whose wound was much slighter than he thought, stood bleeding, but unshrinking, before him. “I do.” “You will reveal it to me?” “No.” “You shall be richly rewarded if you do—you shall die like a dog if you refuse.” “I am ready.” “Is she your mistress?” “She is a woman, and I cannot betray her.” “We will see. Sergeant Gregoire, leave this bold youth with me. Conduct the rest of the prisoners into the court, and do your duty—instantly.” Stupified, incredulous, bewildered, the unhappy beings were marched out. The soldiers' tramping tread was heard as they drew up on the pavements under the window, and at each motion their muskets clanked with an ominous regularity. Dubois filled a large glass with wine till it overflowed. “You think, perhaps, I am not in earnest,” said he. Claude's heart turned to ice. He could not believe his eyes. “Will you save your life? I swear you shall be untouched if you will utter one word to put me on the clew.” “I am not a traitor. I cannot purchase my life at such a price,” replied Claude. At that instant was heard the discharge of musketry, and a deep groan, that made Claude thrill with horror in every fibre of his frame. Even Dubois turned pale. Claude's face also was bloodless, and a faintness came over him, such as no pen may describe—such as he thought would suspend his being without the aid of the executioner. “Let them cry `Vive le Roi' now!” said Dubois; “and as for you—you shall follow them in one minute if you do not reveal your secret; will you do so?” “I protest against this brutal barbarity,” said Claude. “I cannot believe, Monsieur le Colonel, that you will murder me for refusing the basest act of cowardice and treachery. I throw myself upon your generosity —your mercy” (and his voice quivered). “Do you mean to say,” cried Dubois, turning livid with rage, “that you still refuse to discover the retreat of this woman?” “I do,” said Claude. Sergeant Gregoire here marched in at the head of his silent company, who ranged themselves in a line before the table, and at his command reloaded their pieces. “Gregoire,” said Dubois, “lead ten more men into the court, and send this obstinate fool after his companions.” “Cold-blooded fiend!” said Claude. The ruffian made a furious gesture with his arm. “Forward—march,” said the sergeant, with military brevity. Claude advanced. He had done with life. This, then, was death. They passed from the hall—through the corridor—into the open air. The sky was above him. The afternoon sunshine fell calm and yellow in the court. The breeze touched his face. He heard the barking of a dog—the careless warble of a bird— a flock of pigeons swept down into the court, and, frightened by the soldiery, rose and mounted again into the balmy air. He beheld the waving branches of the trees. The silver clouds were lying in the heavens, and the broad green fields were stretched in the distance. He cast one look above—around—then the form of Ida arose to his imagination. One word could save him, but that word would consign her to a fate worse than death. “No,” said Claude; “when the hand of a profligate dashed a blow upon my forehead, I refused to peril my life because I thought the occasion unworthy of it. Here humanity—honour—courage, call upon me to throw it away. May God protect this now unfriended girl and receive my soul.” “Comrades!” said Claude, with a firm, bold voice. “Hold! he yields,” cried Dubois from the window. “I ask one favour!” “It shall be granted!” cried Dubois. “Let me give the word myself; and, when you fire, aim at the heart.” The sound of horses' hoofs was heard. They approached at a rapid rate. A horseman rode into the court. He was of gigantic stature. The crowd of U 2 ruffians recognised him, and hailed his approach with acclamations and cries of “Vive Danton!” “What is this—who is this?” cried he. “Sacre diable! I know this face. Ah! where is your colonel, my good fellows? You have been busy, I see; so much the better; but this—I have seen that face before, and I owe it a service. See, he is falling. Is he already dead?” In truth, loss of blood and the emotions of these scenes had been too much for Claude's strength. He had stood erect to receive the fire of the soldiers, and he had already bidden farewell to earth; but in the delay so much beyond the moment, when he expected to receive the fire of his murderers in his bosom, the excitement of the moment, which had sustained him till then, gave way—his brain swam—a coldness, a faintness, and then a darkness crept over him. He believed already the ghastly ordeal past. He sank down upon the stones, and saw and heard no more of what was going on around him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XXIX. It was several days after the preceding events, and at the first sign of daybreak on a cloudless morning towards the latter part of the autumn, that a wretched, half-broken carriage, with two spavined horses and a ragged postillion, drew up at a small auberge near the old chateau St. Marie. A rough but strong horse, saddled, was attached to a post at the door; and Claude, in the Jacobin costume of that period, at the sound of the wheels, appeared at the door and had some moments' consultation with the postillion. They both looked with many signs of impatience towards Paris, when the sound of another vehicle was heard with such lively tokens of satisfaction that it was easy to discover how much interest they had in its approach. They then retired within the house, of which the window-shutters and curtains were carefully closed. The second carriage also drew up at the little inn, and three figures stepped out. One was St. Marie, the other Carolan, the third the tall and gaunt figure of Danton —his rough and burly visage expanded with good-humour, and his deep voice every instant making itself heard in half-uttered exclamations of pleasure and self-satisfaction. “Ah! ca! voyons!” said he, patting Carolan; “go in—par Dieu!—ha! ha! Attendez, mon ami, attendez —you will see in the house--ah! ha! ha!” Of these three persons, the most strikingly changed in dress, appearance, and manner was Carolan. He was pale, emaciated, ragged, and stained with filth. His manner was subdued into a wretchedness and despair which strongly contrasted with his usual self-complacency and arrogance; and he looked with such a bewildered and terrified air upon his facetious conductor, and watched so eagerly for the person who should answer the tap on the door, that it was clear he had not yet been let into the secret of what he was to behold. Indeed, he had been now, for the first time, taken out of his miserable prison, where he had been many months confined, and where he had witnessed scenes enough to break the spirit of a bolder man; and he expected little more in the present morning than to be conducted to the guillotine, or to be massacred in some less open way. Half dead with terror and exhaustion, he was led hastily in through the opened door, and found himself in the presence of Claude, who, completely dressed for travelling, seized his hand and led him into a room, where Ida, in the plain dress of a maid-servant, which she had procured from Annette (and in which, by-the-way, she looked extremely pretty), threw herself into his arms with a flood of tears. “What is this? where are we? St. Marie! Wyndham!” “Stay not to inquire, my dearest father,” said Ida, clinging to his bosom with streaming eyes. “But—” “Be satisfied,” said Claude. “Dearest sir, all is right; we have no time to lose. This moment we take our flight out of France.” “Ah, Dieu! out of France? By what means? How have I escaped my dungeon? where? what friend? Danton drew off dozens for the guillotine—it is but by the chance of a lot that I was not beheaded yesterday.” “Come, come,” said the huge and good-humoured stranger, a cloud passing a moment over his broad, rough countenance, “nothing against Danton this morning, if you please. I am Danton! and it is to me, under that honest person yonder, that you owe your freedom. What! do you think me a monster, because you do not see the wisdom of the plans which a dire necessity makes me follow for poor oppressed France? Believe me, sir, although I am the reluctant cause of much unhappiness and bloodshed, it is for France and for mankind that I am so. But do not carry away with you, to the happy country where I learn you are going, the idea that I am insensible to kind emotions. No! I sympathize with the distress I am compelled to occasion, and often I relieve it. Be yourselves at once the witnesses and the proof of my mercy. To free Carolan and St. Marie I have been obliged to make great exertions, and to run even some danger; but I am not the man to be easily discouraged. Go—you are free. Your course to Nymeguen shall not be interrupted. I send with you an officer, with such a passport as will carry you past the frontier without a single stoppage. Go, friends, to a happy land—to a happier fate; leave France to woes unutterable, and me, perhaps, to the scaffold!” He passed out without other adieu, and the carriage which brought him was heard rattling away back to Paris. “What magic! what guardian angel!” muttered Carolan; “who has done all this?” Ida pointed to Claude, and strove to speak, but could not. “Allons, messieurs, en route,” said a strange voice, startling all from their mutual congratulations. It was the gen d'armes provided by Danton. “I am desired to see you safe to the frontier,” said the soldier; “we have no time to lose.” It need not be added that but little time was wasted in getting ready. The count and Ida, with Annette and St. Marie, entered the carriage. Claude mounted his horse. He was thoroughly armed, and it would have been ill with any one who had interrupted their path. The old horses accomplished the journey better than could have been expected from their appearance; and at length, all dangers past, they reached Rotterdam, and sought in a good hotel the repose of mind and body of which they all stood in need. History, which records the extraordinary manner in which a crowd of ladies belonging to the court of the unfortunate Marie Antoinette were rescued from the mob by one or two of the leaders of the memorable attack on the royal chateau on the tenth of August, and escorted in safety from the scene of action, has also left several authentic evidences of intervals of the kind-heartedness and bonhomie of Danton, and his readiness to sympathize with individual instances of distress, even at the time when he was calculating how many hundred thousand heads were to fall before France could be depopulated to the necessary point. We cannot think of entering too much into details respecting the few days passed by our party of fugitives at Rotterdam, to recover from the exhaustion consequent upon their visit to France, and to wait also the sailing of the vessel which was to bear them to London, for there it had been determined they should go. Count Carolan's broken health and St. Marie's age and feebleness nearly monopolized the society of Ida; and Claude, with a delicacy peculiar to his character, avoided pressing himself too much into their presence. After a separation so long and events so agitating, he preferred leaving them together; besides which, he had many arrangements to make, letters to write, and affairs to attend to, of which they little suspected the import. It was impossible, however, to avoid many moments of solitary meeting, which were full of enchantment to Claude, as they fully confirmed those tokens of tender confidence which had escaped from his charge while flying through the wood from the chateau St. Marie. Their mutual demeanour, without any formal avowal of their attachment, had insensibly assumed a character more and more indicative of the sentiments they entertained for each other —far different from what it had ever been before, and, perhaps, from what either intended. Long before the ship-captain who had agreed to take them to London was ready to sail, Claude had learned to regard Ida as his own, with a feeling of deep happiness which more than compensated for all that he had suffered; and she also, by no means a dull scholar, had learned to listen to his words—to lean on his arm—to gaze into his face, as the fondest wife receives the regards of the happiest husband. The rescue of St. Marie had been all but miraculous. When on the point of massacring him, it was discovered that he had a large sum of money in the hands of an English banker. It was the policy of certain among the rulers of that period to spare those who could purchase their lives with a sufficient ransom. St. Marie had been saved, and secretly sent to Paris, and thrust into the same prison which contained Carolan, until he should complete the transfer necessary to his release. He had shared the benefit of Claude's negotiations, but both he and Carolan were impoverished. Their whole fortune had been sacrificed. Carolan had strangely altered during his several months' experience of a prison and the few hours when he thought they were leading him to death. All his pomposity of manner had disappeared. He was simple, grateful, and perfectly natural. He did not even appear half so much an — (the word Claude had used himself in former times, but wondered that he should have done so) as he was generally considered; but, on the contrary, he discovered himself to be a man of mind, sense, and feeling, which valuable attributes had been miraculously restored by a wholesome period of adversity. How many are there who would be improved by the same means! There were moments when Claude even respected and liked him; and our manuscript goes on to assert, that the favourable opinion thus produced of his good taste and discrimination was by no means diminished when, one day, just as Claude and Ida were proposing to go out to walk— probably for the last time before the little vessel which was to bear them to London, and which was to start with the first fair wind, should sail—he came out with, “Wyndham, you are the very finest fellow that ever lived. Your conduct to me has been entirely noble. I have been reflecting on it a great deal, and, I am ashamed to add, mine to you has been unworthy of me. You have acted like a man, and I like a fool. I am sadly impoverished by the demand of Danton, but I hope I am not ruined. I have enough for us all to live upon, and—” Here Claude turned very red, and Ida equally pale; but, in a moment, as if they were exchanging cheeks as well as hearts, Ida turned crimson, and the blood ebbed from the face of Claude. “You have saved Ida's life and—” “I think the wind is freshening,” said Ida, rising, “and we shall sail to-night.” “But not,” said the count, drawing her towards him, and suffering her to hide her face in his bosom, “till I have consigned you, Ida, to a master abler to protect and worthier to possess you than I or any other human being.” “I cannot,” said Claude, “at present enter into any such contract.” “Cannot!” echoed Carolan, the colour now in turn spreading over his face. Ida only clung to him the more closely, with a faint exclamation, which was instantly suppressed. “I deem it proper,” said Carolan, a touch of his old manner crossing him for the first time since his imprisonment, “to say, that I have no authority for my remark but your own apparent desire; and that an imperative sense of duty will demand, that instantly—” “Suspend your displeasure for a while, my dear count,” said Claude. “There is another—a lady, who has a prior right over me.” Ida sprang back and gazed with astonishment. “Why, confound it, sir!” thundered the count, “are you already married?” “At London I will tell all,” said Claude, with a quiet smile. “You have kept me some time waiting; do not complain if, for a few hours—” “Complain!” said Carolan, with his chin again in the air. Ida looked at Claude; his eyes were not averted, and he even took her hand, and pressed it respectfully and tenderly to his lips. They were interrupted by the captain, a fine old English sailor, with a face the colour of a mahogany table. “Come, shipmates,” said he, “all ready! we're off in an hour, and, with this wind, we shall see the Tower in less than no time.” “That will be an extremely short passage!” said Claude, who seemed blessed with an uncommon flow of spirits, which no one had ever seen in him before; “but you cannot be too quick for us, my old heart of oak!” “Come aboard, then, sir, and we'll show you what the little Sally Darly can do. She'll make eleven knot before ten. Take care of that plank, miss. Hadn't you better let me hand the young lady, sir?” “No, captain,” said Claude; “if the Sally Darly is such an interesting creature, you must devote yourself to her, and I shall relieve you of the young lady, who has her good points too.” Ida lifted her eyes half tearfully, half laughingly to his, and, if wonder was mixed with their tenderness, he saw at once there was no doubt. As they crossed the plank over which it was necessary to pass to the Sally Darly from the wharf, Ida shrunk a moment from the narrow board; but Claude drew her arm in his, and, as he supported her on her way, it was quite surprising to see the effect of mere timidity upon her cheeks; for it was not proved that the single word which Claude murmured in her ear as he passed his arm around her waist and partly carried her on board, could have had any connexion with their heightened colour, nor with the downcast glance of quiet happiness which was scarcely shaded by her glittering lashes. The Sally Darly, unlike belles in general, more than equalled the praises of her admirer. She sped over the water with all the impatience felt by some of her passengers; and at last the sweet shores of old England—land of peace and virtue—that “emerald gem set in the silver sea”—rose on either side of them. The now nearer shores revealed their soft beauties to the eyes of the enchanted travellers, whose joy was only clouded by a reflection of the frightful wo which devoured the unhappy land they had left behind. The Sally Darly, faithful to her captain's promise, was soon anchored off the Tower, and the party was speedily landed and committed to the mercies of the custom-house officers, who were then, as they are now, very civil fellows to those who deserve it. While waiting for the examination of their luggage, St. Marie and Carolan held a long consultation in a distant corner of the room, which, by their gloomy Vol. II.—X faces, was probably concerning the total ruin of their fortunes. Ida and Claude sat together upon a bench, waiting, whether with impatience or not we shall not say, for the termination of this their second, but less serious captivity. While engaged in conversing, in a low voice, in a shadowy embrasure of the room, Ida's veil drawn close over her bonnet, so that no one except her companion could distinguish her features, a boy entered and handed to Claude a note. It was addressed to Mademoiselle Ida Carolan, and it was her mother's handwriting. She opened it with trembling eagerness. It ran thus: “My beloved Child, “Having just despatched a line to your father, I avail myself of a last moment to tell you I am in London, well and happy. I have heard all by the attentive care of Mr. Wyndham. I know that your father's and uncle's splendid fortunes are entirely sacrificed, but I know also that you are safe, and that makes me happy. Yes, my child, we are beggars—we have nothing; but we shall meet in an hour, and this thought makes all misfortunes supportable. “Adieu for an hour, etc., etc.” “My mother in London?” said Ida. “Oh, you have done this!” “I wrote her from Paris to meet us there.” “And ruined—and—and—well,” said Ida, the momentary shadow of her face passing away in the joyful news of her mother's recovered health and presence in London. “Yes, dearest Ida, she tells you the truth; your father's fortune, as well as your uncle's, is entirely gone. Can you be happy without the splendour to which you have been accustomed? Without palaces—and equipages—and serving-men? Can you be happy beneath a lowly roof—without society—without grandeur—leading a simple, a lonely life, even—despised by the unfeeling—pitied by the compassionate—neglected, and at length forgotten by all? Can you be happy thus, dear Ida?” He held out his hand; she laid her own in it with a blush that gave new charm to her beauty. “With you — in the loneliest spot — beneath the humblest roof—far away from grandeur and the grand —I ask no more. Oh, if you could know how often and often I have wished my father was poor—that he would lose all his fortune, that there might be no obstacle to our union. You think I shall regret my grandeur? Oh, no—never! It has made my unhappiness. It separated me from you.” “Where shall we go, then? What shall we do? You know I am but just out of prison for a paltry debt. How shall we get our living in England?” “Oh, a thousand ways. I will become a governess. I will teach languages, as you did. Little did you know how I admired your conduct—how I—I loved you—when I used to see you, so meanly dressed—so pale—so melancholy—so neglected—going through the streets to give your lessons. Your common clothes were a thousand times more beautiful to me than all the handsomest court uniforms; and when I used to be at the king's suppers, how much rather I should have been with you in your poor jail. Oh”—the tears filled her eyes—“never will you know what I suffered till I succeeded in making Lavalle relieve you!” “Well, then, you shall become a governess, and I will also teach languages. We will open a little school together—” “Oh, we shall be too—too happy!” “In the mean time, I have a mother—” “You a mother? you! How extremely strange! I thought—they told me—” “Yes, I have a mother. We are going to her house. Prepare yourself to be pained at the meanness, the poverty of my abode; a miserable contrast to your father's gorgeous palace at Berlin. Then my mother— I hope you will like her!” “Oh, I am sure I shall,” said Ida, but with a timid and hesitating air, and pale at the gloomy picture he had presented. They were now released by the custom-house officers, and passed into the street, free to go whithersoever they would. “But where shall we go?” said the count. “Have you thought of this, Mr. Wyndham?” “Oh yes,” said Ida, timidly. “I really cannot tell the way myself,” said Claude, “but yonder is a person who perhaps will assist us.” A stout, good-looking, and very neatly-dressed man, in a plain but handsome livery, approached as he spoke. “Welcome, my lord!” said he. “Welcome back to England!” Ida looked inclined to laugh, and Carolan stared in silent surprise. “Is he crazy?” asked Ida of Claude, in a whisper. “The carriage is in this direction,” said the man, respectfully. “The servants will take your lordship's things, if you'll please to say which they are.” Claude did so, and followed James. They found a large and elegant carriage waiting for them. Claude aided in Ida, and St. Marie, and the count, and then entered himself. Annette, all astonished, found herself on the box with a coachman so large and dignified looking, so curiously and elegantly dressed, that she knew not whether he was not a great English lord. “Grosvenor Square!” said James. “Drive fast!” And off they dashed, at a velocity which might have taxed the powers even of the “Sally Darly” to equal. They stopped before a magnificent mansion. A crowd of domestics were at the door and ranged along the hall. All was lofty—grand—magnificent. “Where are we going?” said the count. “Permit me—really—to observe, Mr. Wyndham, that—” “Where—where are we?” said Ida, as they entered a suite of splendid drawing-rooms. “At home! my sweet, sweet girl,” said a well-known voice; and she was folded in the arms of her mother, and then of Madame Wharton. “And my hero—my son!” said Madame Wharton, pale as death, and her face bathed in tears. Pale—paler than all the dangers through which he had passed could make him, Claude entered the last. It seemed as if he had paused to gather strength and firmness to meet the flood of joy which now over-whelmed him. “My mother! my beloved mother!” was all his quivering lips could utter; and they were folded in each other's arms, with emotions which we shall be easily excused for not attempting to depict. How all the discoveries were communicated to each other—how Ida and the count were made to comprehend—how Claude learned what he had still to learn —how the servants gazed at their new master—how comfortable and elegant every one of the worn and exhausted travellers found the apartments separately allotted to them—how all were refreshed by the bath, the toilet, and the most delightful restoratives—how Annette's head almost turned giddy with joy when she found in what way her disinterested affection for her young mistress was to be rewarded—how transformed they all were in a few hours, by aid of new costume, and the care of maids and valets—how—in short, it would be an endless, if not a hopeless task to describe the scenes which followed. Suffice it to say, that everything went just as it should; everything fell out as fortunately as if it had been a play, or a piece of enchantment, or one of the mere fictions which those good-for-nothing varlets the novel writers invent according to their own idle imagination. Some days entirely restored the whole party to health and spirits; for, when the mind is free from care and the heart at ease, the body is easily cured.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">X 2 CHAPTER XXVIII. There is much more to relate of the prominent characters in the past history, but we are already, we fear, trespassing beyond the limits generally allotted to such a story. The reader will, we trust, excuse omissions which the may easily supply with his own imagination. It was many weeks before Claude sufficiently recovered from the avocations and emotions consequent upon the new position in which he found himself, to think calmly upon the past or the future. Within that period he had become the husband of her whom he had loved so ardently, and for whom he had dared so many dangers. The novel prospects opened to him— the duties, acquaintances, responsibilities, pleasures, and plans, so far above all his wildest fancy could have pictured or his highest hopes desired—expanded his mind with almost a new existence. It required all his firmness of character to remain unchanged; but he did so; and, ere many months had passed away, he had subdued excesses of joy as he had before done excesses of grief, and learned to move with calmness and self-possession in his new sphere. A more contented husband, a happier wife, perhaps never assumed the graver responsibilities of matrimony. For each had that conscientious and clear perception of duty—that innate sense of moral right, which had sustained both in adversity, and did not desert them in prosperity. Amid the happiness by which they were surrounded, consisting of all that earth could bestow, they did not fail to prostrate themselves, as humbly as ever they had done at their darkest hour, before that Supreme Being before whom all the forms of life are as passing shadows, except what is founded in the power of self-government and the practice of virtue, at the sacrifice even of the world's applause—even of the happiness of the heart. Some time after their union, Claude walked through one of the back streets of London in order to seek and relieve a poor fugitive recently escaped out of France. He arrived at the door of the house indicated as the residence of the object of his search. He knocked. The man was not at home, and he was leaving the door, when a woman, apparently a beggar, passed him and entered the door. She had on a worn and tattered frock, entirely divested of ornament; an old bonnet scarcely fit for use. It was a cold winter day, but she was without cloak, shawl, and gloves, and seemed emaciated with sickness, grief, and hunger, and trembling with cold. As she entered she staggered against the wall, apparently intoxicated; so much so that Claude drew back, with that disgust which one feels at beholding a woman in so degraded a situation. “She's drunk, sir, poor thing,” said the bloated-faced woman who kept the wretched lodging-house; “but I never seed her so afore. She's generally a werry temperate person, though werry poor pay. I must turn her out to-day, as I can't afford to take people in my house for nothing—and drunken sluts like her too! Here, you—good woman! you might as well hear it now as later. You must clear out o' my house. Tramp—clear! Your room's better than your company!” Claude was about leaving the steps, when he was arrested by the voice of the unfortunate creature, and the deep anguish and pathos so far removed from intoxication. “For God's dear sake, do not turn me out to-day!” said she. “I shall die on the pavement.” “Die where you like, so long as you don't die in my house,” replied the woman. “Oh, what shall I do?” “People as can afford to get drunk—” “Drunk? Oh, I am not, believe me. I am only faint from fatigue and want of food.” She turned her face—Claude's eyes fell upon it. “Great God!” he cried, “do my eyes deceive me? No—it is impossible.” “Mr. Wyndham! Merciful Heaven! I thank you. Yes, it is I.” “Mrs. Denham!” “Yes—starving in the street—fainting with hunger. Oh, sir,” she added, a flood of shame crimsoning her pale face, “that you should ever see me in this situation!” Tears of bitter pain and self-reproach filled Claude's eyes, and had hitherto kept him silent. In the fulness of his bliss he had neglected to inquire of her. “Poor Denham!” he faltered. “Don't name him! Oh, Mr. Wyndham, that rash act—that selfish—that—what suffering it has caused me! My father—” “Your father?” “Dead!” “And your friends—your family?” “All that I could have appealed to are far away from London, and I would not be a burden to those already poor. I thought I could make a living, first by drawing, then by teaching music, then by sewing, and lately by going out to service. Yes, I have been a maid-servant rather than eat the bread of beggary or shame. But my helplessness—my feebleness—my misery—my ill health, disqualified me for all occupation. I have been ill, too, and alone; the privations I have suffered—the coarse unkindness of the people about me—the insults offered me, and the gross vice I have been obliged to witness—to be in contact with —oh, Charles, Charles, had you known what was to follow, would you have brought upon your poor wife all these horrors?” “And Ellen?” “She has a place at a shoemaker's in the city. She works fourteen hours a day, and scarcely gains her bread; they abuse and beat her—she—I—” And the unhappy being, turning ashy pale, staggered back, and would have fallen had not Claude caught her on his arm. He called instantly for a hackney-coach, and, in the mean time, the woman of the house administered to her wants with a world of protestations and apologies. She said that she had already pitied her from her heart—that she had already seen she was something better than common. She had told her husband she would not wonder if she had been even a carriage-lady in her time. Madam Denham revived as the coach drove up to the door, and Claude supported her in with the assistance of a maid, whom he requested to accompany them. He ordered the coachman to drive at once to Grosvenor Square. Ida received her unhappy guest with the sympathy which such hearts as hers always feel with misfortune; but when she learned who she was, and how far her husband was, although innocently, the cause of her calamity, she fully entered into all his feelings, and protested she should watch over and cherish her as a beloved sister. In the night the poor invalid grew worse; she was attacked with a violent and dangerous fever, in the course of which, at length, reason entirely deserted her. It was only by means of force that she could be kept in bed. Her paroxysms during this period were shocking to behold. She acted over again, in imagination, the terrible scene which she had suffered in Berlin. She still seemed to wait and wait for the beloved husband who was never to return alive. She fancied she heard the hours strike ten—eleven—twelve—one, and at length that she beheld borne in the dead body of him who a few hours before had been her support, her refuge, her pride, her happiness, her hope. Again she kissed his pale lips, felt his cold bosom, and thought her fingers stained with his blood. Then she fancied that she had passed away from that dark scene and fatal hour. She was wandering about London—shrinking from police-officers—praying mercy of the licentious and the intoxicated, and that they would not insult her —and at length she implored bread from the street-passengers. “Ah! give me bread—only bread! Work? I cannot. Look at these arms! Cruel! he's gone. Ah! madam, will you take pity on me? I am starving! A prison? For mercy's sake, no!” All the skill of the physician could not treat this state of excitement with much hope of recovery. Early the next morning, leaving Mrs. Denham to the tender care of Ida, Claude went in his carriage to the shop of the shoemaker, whose address he had learned, and where his little favourite Ellen had been bound as an apprentice. It was a mean, low, dark, filthy shop, in a damp, narrow, blind alley. A brutal-looking man with a red nose, and harsh, appalling features, was tending the shop, while a shrewish woman, with a face sour as vinegar, had been examining the work of the little girl, who, pale and silent, in ragged and dirty clothes, sat by the window binding a shoe. “It's wretchedly done. It isn't fit to be seen,” said the woman; “you little, lazy, good-for-nothing slut, take that!” And she gave her a blow upon the ears enough to make the child's brain reel again. “Ah! that's right; it's the only way to make anything of her.” “It's the best I could do,” said Ellen, in a voice so unhappy and resigned that it went to Claude's heart. “Silence, you vagabond. Do you bandy words with me too?” said the man. “What can I do for you, sir?” said he, turning to Claude with a smile fit for a customer. Ellen did not raise her eyes. “I have come to see this little girl,” said Claude. But the tones of his voice had no sooner reached Ellen's ears, than she uttered an exclamation of acute surprise and joy, and lifted her eyes. On recognising him as he extended his arms, she started up with a scream of exquisite delight. “Why, what on earth is in the child?” said the man, leaning over with a threatening countenance, and raising his hand to strike her. But his arm was arrested by Claude, and the brutal tyrant was thrust with some force against the wall on the opposite side of the room. “Zounds and fury, sir,” cried the man, rushing forward with clinched fists, “if you were the king, I'd learn you better manners than that!” “Stop, sir,” said Claude, calmly but firmly grasping him by the throat; “you are a brutal, infamous, drunken scoundrel; you must know that such treatment as I have witnessed towards this little girl subjects you to severe punishment; and, if you advance farther, I shall be obliged to teach you on the spot a lesson you deserve to learn.” “Oh! Mr. Wyndham—dear, dear Mr. Wyndham— save me! save me from these cruel people!” “Who are you, and what are your intentions?” demanded the man, his wrath and resistance entirely abated by the stern and cool attitude with which Claude had addressed him. “There is my card,” said Claude. “I have the power to make you rue what you have done; give me the articles of indenture of this little girl, and let me take her away, and I will let you go; otherwise I shall instantly take measures to have you punished.” “Your lordship's grace—is—the master—I did not know—the child can go where your grace's lordship likes—your worship.” “Yes—certainly—your honourable excellency will not wish to ruin two poor honest people,” said the woman. “Here are the articles,” said the man, taking from a drawer, with hands trembling partly with intemperance and partly with rage and fear, the papers demanded. “Come, my sweet Ellen,” said Claude. “And my shoe!” said the little girl, trembling and bewildered. “Let them finish it themselves, my dearest child,” said Claude, smiling; “you will have other work, I hope.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XXIX. One more scene—the last which closes our story— was reserved for Claude, as if Providence had wished to teach, with the full force of contrast, the lesson which we have feebly endeavoured to illustrate by giving this true history to the world. A few days afterward Claude received a visit from Lavalle. The joy which he felt on seeing him was checked by his sad air, his pale and thin face, and the melancholy betrayed in his appearance and actions. “What is the matter with my best of friends?” said Claude. “I am a fugitive from justice. I have killed a man. You have followed your principles, and I mine. You must know that Elkington, on leaving Berlin after Ida rejected him, had made use of expressions derogatory to her character. I determined to call him to account; but, knowing him to be a fatal shot, I practised with the pistol till I became as expert as he. I thought I should revenge your wrongs—Denham's— Ida's—and mankind's, by pursuing and killing such a scourge to society. I had been also unhappy in my own affairs. The young lady whom I had engaged to marry betrayed me; and I thought, in case of my falling, there was no one who could mourn my loss. I therefore followed Elkington, and demanded of him an apology for the slander he had circulated against Ida. Perhaps it was more with the hope of falling myself than of killing my antagonist, for I was really tired and disgusted with life.” “Against Ida! slander! ridiculous,” said Claude. “Nevertheless, he had done so; the words he uttered merited death; they were the blackest calumny a man could utter.” “And did you deem the poison from the foul lips of such a man worth your attention?” “Yes; he refused to explain, and I called him out. We fought at Ostend. At the first fire he fell, mortally wounded. I fled to London. He still survives, but has been also brought over here. Since the event his mind has undergone a great change. He has become conscious of his baseness, and bitterly repents of it. His terror of a future world has been so great that it has driven him mad.” “Can such a man as Elkington fear a future world?” said Claude. “Oh, yes, and more. I believe, from what I have heard, he is completely repentant. In his intervals of reason he has demanded to see both me and you. He says he cannot, he will not die till he has obtained our pardon. Of me, alas! he has nothing to ask; but I am wretched with the thought of what I have done. I did not know what it was to deprive a fellow-being of existence—to behold the suffering I have inflicted—the death I have caused. He deserved to die, but I am sorry I am his executioner. Will you see him?” “I had rather not.” “It is his desire to see us both before he dies.” “Where is he?” “I tremble to tell.” “Where? You frighten me!” “In a mad house! In Bedlam.” “Gracious Heavens!” “Deprived of his fortune, he was seized by creditors and stripped of everything. When he fought, he was without the means to live. Of this I knew nothing till subsequently. The physician says he will not, perhaps, last through the day. You must come instantly.” Vol. II.—Y “I had rather not; strange feelings of indignation arise at the mention of that man's name; he is the murderer of my friend—” “No matter; you will experience new emotions at the sight of him, but neither anger nor revenge will be among them.” “Indeed, I had rather not; it would look so like triumphing over a fallen enemy.” “No, it is to soothe, to oblige, to forgive a dying enemy. I go; it will give me much more pain.” “Come, then, I will go. I have no right to refuse.” They entered a carriage, and drove at once to the building where lay the fallen, the dying Elkington. He was lying in a small whitewashed room, entirely destitute of furniture except the bed he lay on. His arms and hands were confined in that kind of dress they call a straight waistcoat, and a strap around his waist prevented his leaving the bed, or rising farther than in a sitting posture. His face was so dreadfully altered that it was with difficulty they recognised him. His hair, beard, and whiskers were unshorn, and had grown very long and ragged, and his eyes seemed of an unnatural size and brightness. Claude and Lavalle both turned pale with horror as they gazed on this object: Claude with horror and compassion, Lavalle with bitter self-reproach. The poor wretch did not hear them come in. He was lying on his back, stretched out to his full length —his chin raised in the air—his head thrown back, and moving in sudden jerks, so as to describe a circle around the room with his eyes — from the floor — up the wall—over the ceiling—down to the floor again. This he repeated continually, with that monotony of motion peculiar to madness. Suddenly he exclaimed, in the most touching voice possible, “Oh, God! how well — how well I know this place!” Claude was thrilled to the soul with the pathos of that voice. A hidden quality of character appeared in it; a tenderness, a feeling, which he could not reconcile with the nature of the cold, malignant, bad man he had known and hated so. “Yes—yes,” he exclaimed, in the same grief-strick en, touching tones, “that I know full well!” He threw up his eyes again, and measured the ceiling and walls with them, his head flung back in an agony of anguish. “Well, well, we shall see—we shall see, in God's own good time! Oh! how I know this place—how well I know it!” “Why, Elkington, my friend,” said Claude, thrilling in every fibre of his frame, “how are you to-day?” He stopped suddenly, like one caught unexpectedly by observers when he was doing something he supposed in complete solitude, and he looked at the speaker fixedly, surprisedly, and sternly. “How do you do, Mr. Wyndham?” he said, almost in his natural voice. “I have come to see you. I hope you are better, and that you have everything comfortable.” He gave another broad and stern gaze, which suddenly changed into a silent laugh; then he closed one eye, and looked slyly with the other into the corner of the room, as if exchanging signs with some being there invisible to all but himself. Then he began once more the motion with his head—now laughing cunningly, as if chuckling over some secret—then pausing to measure his visiters from head to foot, with glances of such scorn and malice—of hate and ferocity—as made it evident that only his confinement kept them safe from his violence. These changes of countenance were appalling to behold. You could see though his face, as into a mirror, the workings of the disturbed sea beneath; the wild, disjointed clouds drifting gloomily through his mind, sometimes breaking into a gleam of sunshine, then gathering over in stormy masses black as night. “Ah! Mr. Wyndham,” he cried, suddenly, “we want no dances; no, we had them once; we proved them well—well—ah ha! ah ha! ah ha!” Unable to endure this frightful scene, Lavalle moved to go. Elkington suddenly stopped. “Don't go—don't go,” said he; “sit down—sit down —sit down on that bed—lie down on that bed.” “We will—we will,” said Lavalle, shocked and trembling to behold the work of his rash hands, “we will come and sit with you often, dear Elkington.” He laughed. “You have a pleasant room,” said Claude. He looked at him as if he would tear him into a thousand pieces. “Clean and cool,” said Lavalle, in a tremulous voice, hoping, by assuming an indifferent air, to calm the agitation of his perturbed, wandering mind. He fixed his glittering, wild, distended eyes on the speaker, as if he knew he was a hypocrite—as if he read his soul. Lavalle could not, without a painful effort, stand the unearthly glance. Then suddenly he smiled and said, “Yes—cool!—very!” With such another scornful glance—so full of hate —of malice—of sarcasm—that both the young men believed he knew he was mad, and hated them for pretending not to see the hellish wreck of his mind. Then he began to laugh, and mow, and wink at the invisible beings who seemed to hold unearthly communion with him in the corner. The doctor came in as they stood beside this frightful spectacle. “Will he live, doctor?” said Claude. “No; to-morrow, at farthest, will carry him off.” “Will he recover his reason?” “No, probably not. He will sink rapidly after this excitement leaves him.” “No rational communication with him?” asked Lavalle. “Never again this side the grave,” said the doctor. “Good-morning, gentlemen.” In the carriage Lavalle covered his face with his hands. He was of a livid whiteness. “This horrible sight will never, never leave my mind,” said he; “to think that this hand has hurled that wretched being into his present state. Oh! how much I wish I had followed your wiser counsel—your example.” “He struck me,” said Claude, “and I thanked God every moment I was there that I had turned from his blood and left his punishment to Heaven. Believe me, my friend, He who placed us in this mysterious world meant we should govern our rash passions which betray us into such errors, and that our hands should rather be lifted in humble supplication for mercy to Him than be plunged into the—” “Spare me, Wyndham, spare me! I would give all I am worth in life to wipe that rash, bad act from my conscience.” The next day brought news of Elkington's death, and nearly at the same hour Mrs. Denham breathed her last. Lavalle left England and stayed many years abroad. It is even said he once received a gross public insult from a young blood, for which he refused to seek redress by a duel. Lady Beverly also remained all her life abroad. She received from the generosity of Claude a sufficient amount to allow her to live as she had been accustomed to. The old Jew who had possessed himself of such a heavy mortgage on the Beverly estates by the necessities of Elkington, was some years afterward brought to punishment and transported. He confessed that, in order to retain the estate in Elkington's right, he had employed an assassin to pursue Claude, having discovered his claim before Elkington himself. The Digbys, on their return from Berlin, so far from being cured of their penchant for “déjoonies dong-song” and the “ho-tong,” came to be very stylish people in their way. Miss Mary appeared in society some years afterward as Madame la Comtesse Lippe, that gentleman having married her, and now flourished among the admiring and envying company of the Digbys as a French count ruined by the revolution. Thomson returned to England and acquired quite a reputation by killing a poor French officer in a duel, because he said, in very bad English, “Jean Bull was a bear!” He, however, fell off, in his latter years, into a mere gambler, his idle love of whist having taken a deeper hue. Notwithstanding his gallant feat with the aforesaid French officer, he was horsewhipped and had his nose tweaked by a little man at whose house he was once playing a friendly rubber of whist; and who, after having been beaten regularly all the evening, caught him at a trick which exposed the secret. Should we ever take up the story again, there are several other explanations which we shall feel ourselves bound to make to the reader; but we must not omit to state, that the very pretty Miss Kühl, from whose power Claude had been obliged to withdraw, lest his interesting and amiable manners should prove too much for her, appeared in London, in the course of a few months after his union with Ida, as the lady of an extremely handsome young Russian officer, named Count Stroggonoffennhoff, and made a very good appearance by the side of the young Countess Beverly. Indeed, Claude and Strogg—that is, her husband — became great friends; and from the care the young man took to present his beautiful bride to Claude, and to inform him who she was, &amp;c., it was evident that, although a tolerably well-informed man, he did not know everything that had happened in Europe during this eventful century. Should there be other points which we have failed to clear up—characters of whose fates we have said nothing—mysteries which we have not satisfactorily unravelled, or, in short, anything whatever, in the volumes which we now bring to a conclusion, which may appear in the least improbable, we can only assure the reader that, by informing us of the same, we will consult the MS. in the Bibliothèque du Roi, under the care of Mr. Spiker, the courteous and learned librarian; and we pledge ourselves that all such disputed matters shall be immediately and satisfactorily put right. THE END.</field>
