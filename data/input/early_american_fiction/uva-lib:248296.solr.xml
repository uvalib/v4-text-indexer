      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER I. The Concealed Ship. The opening scene of our story is laid in the Mediterranean Sea in the month of June, 1700. One clear, cloudless morning, towards the latter end of this month, the rising sun, himself yet unseen beneath the ocean, was just touching the skyey outline of the bold summits of the Corsican Sierras with a bright edge of gold. As each moment he rose higher and higher, the darkness fled from the hollows and coverts of the mountain-sides into the sea, revealing first the towers and turrets of a convent perched upon a pinnacle; then, lower down, a walled monastery with its hanging gardens; then a fortress with battlements and embrasures frowning above the waves; and still lower, on the very verge of the sea, the hut of the fisherman! As the bays and inlets caught the morning beams, the fisher's light craft with its long latteen yard across was seen idly anchored near his door, or sluggishly getting underweigh and moving under oars towards the open sea. In one of the inlets of the cliff-bound shore, into which the beams of the morning penetrated, lay moored close in with the towering rock, a large vessel of about four hundred tons. The little bay in which she was sheltered, was about two leagues to the northward of a considerable port on the east side of the Island of Corsica; half a league from her position was a convent surrounded by high and snow-white walls; and on the mountain side, almost above her, stood a monastery half in ruins, yet inhabited. Perched here and there upon a low, rocky projection stood a solitary fisherman's cot, and the jagged peaks of the Sierras, elevated in the distance, formed a bold back-ground to the scene. The vessel in question seemed to have taken up the most advantageous position within the inlet for security, not only from any sudden storm, but from the observation of any vessels which sailed past outside; for unless they fairly entered the narrow bay, and turned sharp to the left, they could not have discovered that it contained any thing besides the half a score of fishing boats which usually belonged in its waters. This vessel had run into this hiding place about midnight, standing in with a bold helm as if familiar with the passage, though it had no other light to guide her than the stars, which could scarcely penetrate the black shadows of the towering rocks that overhung the water in her progress. Yet she moved steadily, now putting her helm a little up to avoid a rock which could hardly be distinguished from the shadows in which it was enveloped, now keeping away to give a birth to a jutting spur; till at length she rounded a sharp precipice, against which her yards swept and dropped anchor behind it, where she lay as if locked in a basin without any outlet. The gun, therefore, had risen and gilded the waves as well as the mountain tops without hull or spar of the shaded vessel reflecting his beams. As the early rising monk from his convent walls glanced down and beheld the stranger his features expressed his surprise at the sight; and ho lingered long after the bell for matins had ceased tolling to watch her with a curious eye. The vine-dresser as he moved toward his upland vineyards stopped in mid-path to wonder why a large vessel should be hiding behind the rocks of his secluded bay; and the fisherman, as he weighed the anchor of his humble craft, gave the stranger a cautious glance, and pulled wide from her anchorage towards his fishing ground; for it was seldom that vessels ever entered the inlet; the port of the island being only two leagues distant, and in case of a storm afforded secure shelter, as well as being easily entered. The inlet on the contrary was narrow and would prove dangerous in a storm to any one that should seek its shelter unless perfectly acquainted with its navigation. But there had been no storm. The night preceding had been pleasant and the waters smooth; and yet in the morning a large four-masted Galleon is found anchored within the bowl-like bay of `El Gancho!' Leaving the curious monk, the wondering vine-dresser and the suspicious fisherman, to solve at their leisure the mystery of this unusual visit to their retirement, we will proceed to describe her appearance as the opening day revealed her shape and proportions. She was a large Spanish Galleon, a ship of very different construction from any of the present day. Her hull was a sort of butter-boat shape, curved towards the bows and stern like a new moon. The stern was very lofty and projecting, and seemed composed of two or three stories, each ornamented with heavy carved work profusely covered with gilding. The bows were also extravagantly high and rounded, and adorned with a group of statues, large as life, representing Ariadne coming out of the sea, mounted upon a golden dolphin and attended by a troop of nereids in golden locks and green robes. The bowsprit was short and almost perpendicular, looking like a fifth mast. Her top-gallant, forecastle and her poop, were full eighteen feet from the main deck, and a sort of draw-bridge led from one to the other fore and aft. She carried twenty four guns, sixteen of them on the main-deck, eight to a side, and the balance were arranged in batteries upon the lofty poop and bows, four forward and four aft. The gun carriages were of mahogany and carved with warlike visages. The ship had four masts; that abaft the mizen being set in the oaken taffrail and stepped in a large timber that jutted out like a davit from the main deck, on the end of which was carved a Neptune's head, with blue hair and a gilded beard. On this mast was carried a sail, now known by seamen as a `driver.' It could also carry a topsail-driver hoisted above the other. The remaining three masts were rigged pretty much like those of ships of the present day, only with more awkward yards and less beauty and symmetry in the hamper and canvass. Her fore-yard had been shot away, and the main-topmast was splintered; while shot sticking in the sides of the vessel showed that she had recently been in action. Her principal sails were now all furled; but her lighter canvass was only brailed up as if ready to be used. As the day broke upon this huge, carved and gilded `galleon' of the olden time, there was apparent on board no inconsiderable bustle and excitement. There stood upon her lofty poop a stout old officer, in a gorgeous Spanish naval uniform and a cocked hat, with a sword in his hand. He was surrounded by several officers, some of them mere youths, but all richly dressed in splendid uniforms. The main deck was crowded with the men of the vessel; and all countenances seemed to show mingled fear and expectation. As soon as the day dawned an officer had ascended the rigging from the deck and thrown himself lightly upon a shelf of the rock, and thence clambered to its summit which overlooked the sea. From time to time as the light increased, he called out from his post to the deck of the galleon beneath him, `Nada en vista!' The old officer would answer back at these reports of `nothing in sight,' and say earnestly in sonorous Spanish. `Keep a close out! Don't let them see you!' He would then pace up and down his deck half-a-dozen steps, stop short, look at his lieutenant, and exclaim with a sort of despair, `Maldilo! What shall we do? What is to be done?' Then without waiting for a reply he would pace the poop between a narrow line formed by his few officers, who were gathered round him as perplexed as himself. `If he discovers us here, we are lost,' answered his chief lieutenant, a handsome young Spanish noble; `unless,' he added, `we can make a battery of our ship and sink him if he ventures in, or die bravely at our guns!' `You speak like a brave man and a true Spaniard, Don Julio,' said the old grey-whiskered Capitan of the galleon, shaking his head. `Our only hope is in his not discovering us! The day is opening, and we shall soon learn if he is in sight!' `Nada vista!' called the officer from the rock, as the sun began to lay a thread of gold upon the skyey edges of the mountains. `Can you see the horizon all around?' shouted the Spanish captain. `All is clear seaward and to the south. To the north, four miles off, the promontory of La Nez juts out so far that I cannot discover what is beyond it. But there is no wind, and whatever is hid by it will lie there!' `So it will,' answered the Capitan rubbing his hands and looking at his lieutenant. `Now let us consult what is to be done, while the calm holds. But first let me question this pescador who piloted us in here so skilfully. Jose?' he called to a short, dark visaged man, in the ordinary costume of a Corsican fisherman. The man came aft and removing his cap waited to be addressed. `Is there any other outlet to this bay than that you brought me in by last night?' `No, senor!' `How far are we from the port of St. Ana?' The man fixing his large, expressive eyes on the officer, replied, `Two leagues, senor, to the south.' `Two leagues! Then why in the name of St. James didn't you let me know it last night, and I could have run for that port instead of putting into this punch bowl. We could have reached it in an hour more?' `True, senor capitan,' answered the pilot. `But when last night you took me from my boat as I was fishing, and said you were chased by a freebooter, and asked me if there was any shelter on the coast, I told your excellency of this; for I knew St. Ana was no safe-port; and I knew you might lie here in security, if you could reach it without being seen by your enemy.' `But I should have been safer in the Port. You should have told me it was so nigh at hand. I thought it was at least ten leagues. Under the guns of its fort we would have defied this `King of the Ocean,' as he arrogantly calls himself.' `This pirate would have more easily taken your ship, senor, from under the guns of the fort at St. Ana than from the basin. He has twice cut vessels out of that harbor in open day. It affords no shelter. He would have seen you lying in the port, and nothing would have kept him from capturing you. It is impossible he should find you in this concealment.' `Well, you have done your duty, pescador! I find no fault. You shall be rewarded with gold. Now, Don Julio, what shall be done?' `There is no question, senor, but that the pirate will continue to pursue us. He was but twelve miles astern at sun-down, and by that time we saw with the glass he had got up another foremast in place of that we shot away five hours before!' `There was no doubt that he was standing on again when night set in; and it is my opinion if Carlos, aloft on the rock, could look over the Nez headland, he would see the freebooters' brig working her way along somehow or another, calm as it is!' `This is my opinion, senor,' replied the lieutenant. `If he should appear in the offing we have only a chance of safety in his passing on, supposing we have run for St. Ana!' `That is my only hope. Here comes His Excellency Don Ferdinand on deck with his charming daughter, Senorita Ellena. We will have his opinion also.' As he spoke a noble looking Spaniard appeared on deck, and advanced towards the group. Upon his left arm leaned a lovely female about twenty years of age, whose lofty style of countenance and stately carriage of the person partook so much of that of the gentleman, that their near relationship was apparent to every eye. She was extremely beautiful. Her hair was shining black, and arranged with taste around her classic forehead in a band of interwoven braids, and was suffered to fall from thence in two or three careless tresses to her graceful shoulders. Her eyes were large, black and penetrating. The expression of her countenance was intelligent and full of feeling. The glance of her eye was joyous yet timid; modest yet mirthful. She was dressed in plain black velvet that closely fitted her perfect shape, and above her bosom shone a single diamond of wonderful lustre and beauty. A lace mantilla or reboso was fastened by a pearl to her hair, and depending from her head was gracefully sustained like a mantle upon one snowy arm. `Good morning your excellency! Felices dias, senorita Elena!' said the capitan, bowing; while the other officers, retiring a step or two, respectfully raised their chapeaus. `I am happy to see you already on deck after our night's run! And you, senora, do not look less lovely notwithstanding the perils we have been in.' `I have no need to cherish fears under the protection of such brave Spaniards as yourself, senor capitan and your officers,' answered the lady with a smile; then turning her eyes upon the bold shores that hung around, upon the cliffs and towering peaks, she silently surveyed the scene like one who felt its solemn grandeur. Her father also surveyed it for an instant with surprise and then spoke: `This is a wild and secret spot into which your pilot brought us last night, senor capitan. Do you know the region!' We are but two leagues from St. Ana.' `It is a pity we could not have reached that port.' `We should have been chased in and attacked under its very guns, the fisherman tells me, and I do not doubt it; as the fort is not very strongly armed or manned. We are safer here, your excellency; if we can lay perdu until the pirate passes along the coast to the south of us.' `What? Has he been seen this morning?' `No senor! Don Carlos is upon yonder rocky point in the air on watch!' `And what hopes have you that he will go by? This port will first attract him.' `No senor. It is frequented only by fishermen. He will never suppose we put in here with St. Ana directly before us.' `But if he should suspect?' `Then I must defend my ship as well as I can. We are repairing our damages here, and the leak has been found and stopped. We will be ready for him and do our best.' `Cannot the specie be landed at once? If we could disembark it and get it secreted in the vicinity or secured in the town, then the loss of the vessel would be a secondary matter. We must devise some means, senor capitan, of securing the vast amount of silver bullion and coin we have on board.' `It will require full twelve hours to land it, even if we could do so among these perpendicular rocks. In the meanwhile four or five hours will decide our fate. If this English pirate is in chase he will soon be in sight.' It is now sun-rise, and in less than an hour a wind will breeze up which will show him, if he is in the northern board. I will at once send a boat, your excellency, along the shore in the direction of the head-land to see if any thing can be seen to the sea in the north.' `This is a wise step.' `Senor capitan,' said the pilot, lifting his red cap,' from yonder wooded hill, across the bay, not half a mile distant, a clear view can be had of the open sea on the northern side. I will go with a boat's crew to that side of the bay and ascend the hill as I am acquainted with the pathway to its summit.' `Well said, pescador,' answered the capitan; and in a few moments a boat with the fisherman in the stern was pulling across the little bay in the direction of the eminence he had pointed out. The captain and his noble passenger, Don Ferdinand de Garcia, with the officers, in the meanwhile continued to converse upon their situation, while Senorita Elena was watching with admiration the arrowy course of the receding boat, as it shot over the glassy, black water, leaving a silvery, shivering line far astern. The galleon was indeed in a perilous condition, especially when is taken into consideration the immense value of her freight, of which her pursuers were full aware and which they would not lightly lose the chance of possessing. She was the Spanish ship `La Reine Isabel,' and bound from Mexico to Cadiz, though now very far out of her longitude and beyond her port. She had left Vera Cruz sixty days before under fair auspices, with a freight of one million of dollars in coin and bullion for the crown. A portion of the bullion consisted of ingots of pure gold. As passengers she had Don Ferdinand de Garcia, ex-Governor of New Spain, returning homeward with his daughter and half a million of dollars. The galleon, like all her species, was armed and manned like a ship of war. She had as a further precaution against the buccaneers that then infested the seas, sailed in company with three other armed galleons, and all four were under convoy of a heavy ship of the line. But in a gale off the western islands she had lost sight of her companions, being blown far off to the southward. Alone she made the rest of her way towards Cadiz, and came within sight of the mountains of Spain, with the wind off shore, when a large gun brig appeared to windward, hoisted the free flag, gave chase to her, and cut her off from her port. The galleon was a fast sailer, and finding she could not reach Cadiz without fighting with a brig of sixteen guns, endeavored to run for Gibraltar.— She would have succeeded in reaching it but for a terrific `norther,' which drove her far through the straits, and against the violence of which she could make no resistance. All she could do was to scud before it and suffer it to drive her into the Mediterranean. It continued three days; but as they lost sight of the pirate in the storm they felt willing to endure the tempest which had parted them. On the morning of the fourth day, the gale having abated, they prepared to make the best of their way back to their port, from which they were several hundred miles to the eastward, when to their consternation they discovered a league to windward the English pirate brig! It was no illusion. There he was with all his spars standing, his free flag flying, and his guns run out steering down towards the ill-fated galleon! The only alternative was flight or fight! It was ascertained with the glass that the enemy had, within eight, as many guns as the galleon, and all of larger calibre. The glass also showed the capitan precisely whom he had for his antagonist; for he could discern, besides the black flag at the peak, the private signal of the pirate flying at the main, on which he could make out a red hand grasping a red sabre, upon a white ground—the well-known flag of the English freebooter, Kidd, whose name had spread terror throughout every sea! This discovery created consternation; the idea of fighting was at once given up, and the galleon put her best foot foremost and made a run of it! The chase continued till the afternoon of the sixth day, the pirate having no less than seven times during this period come within reach of her guns, and each time beaten off and crippled by the well directed fire of the stern chasers of the galleon. All the while the galleon was running from her port and steering only in such directions as the wind would let her. All she desired was to keep the pirate aloof, trusting to Providence for ultimately escaping and reaching some Christian port. On the sixth day they had come within sight of Corsica, near its northern shore, and as the wind was fair the captain of the galleon resolved to make some Italian port. But towards afternoon the pirate, having repaired damages, overhauled him for the eighth time, and getting within range began to open his fire. At the first shot the fore-topmast of the galleon went by the board and she broached to. Her situation was for a few moments critical. The captain hurriedly sprung to the helm and brought the ship to her course, while thick and fast the halls from the brig rattled against her sides and roared above the heads of those upon the quarter deck. It was time for determined action, and the Spaniards showed their skill and courage in the critical emergency. Steadily and heavily they poured in their fire upon the brig, and after a few moments they had the satisfaction of seeing her foremost fall, cut in two by a shot ten feet from the deck! This crippled her so that she was unable to bring another broad-side to bear upon the galleon, which momently increased her distance from her, though still keeping up a sharp fire from her stern guns. The pirate unable to steer hove his vessel to, and set to work to clean his decks of the wreck of the mast. Taking advantage of her good fortune the galleon, without waiting to endeavor to destroy her crippled foe, made all sail to get as far out of her company as possible. By sun-down she had left her full four leagues astern, her hull being visible only from aloft; but it was plain that she had then set a new foremast. It was this discovery and the belief he would yet be pursued, that led the captain to take on board a fisherman to enquire of him for some secluded harbor, into which he might run, in the night, with the hope of thereby eluding the chase altogether, should the pirate continue the pursuit. The fishermen named the bay of El Gancho, and piloted the vessel in under cover of the night. Thus have we accounted for the appearance of the galleon in this secluded Bay. Some persons, especially seamen, might call in question Capitan Baptista's courage, wisdom and seamanship, in running into an inlet and hiding his ship in this way behind a precipice of rocks lying between the basin and the sea. But it was necessary he should make some port. The carpenter had reported, after the action with the pirate, that there was a leak which he could not discover, and which had no doubt been made by a shot striking her under the water line. He moreover wanted provisions and water; and for these he knew he would have to put in somewhere.— The fisherman he had taken on board had told him of this secluded inlet, and as a last hope he determined to give him orders to take his vessel into it, especially on learning from him the exceeding dangerous character of its entrance, which he was assured by the man no vessel would attempt without being familiar with its navigation. On these accounts Don Baptista concealed his galleon, not knowing how near he was to Santa Ana, nor having a chart of the Mediterranean on board, and trusting the pirate's passing the inlet without noticing its entrance, which the fisherman told him was not apparent from the distance a vessel would sail past on the outside. The boat he had despatched from the galleon soon reached the opposite shore, and the fisherman was seen ascending the side of the eminence he had indicated. In his hand he bore a flag which he was to wave if he saw any vessel to the north; in which case it was decided by Don Ferdinand and the captain that the gold bullion and coin, and then as much of the silver ingots as could be removed, should be transferred by the crew from the galleon to the shore, and conveyed to the monastery upon the summit of the rock for safe keeping. `Nada vista!' cried the lieutenant from his lookout. `Nothing in sight!' At the same instant, while his voice was yet echoing among the rocks, from the height across the basin, the fisherman was seen to wave his flag thrice! the signal that a sail was in the northern board.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER II. The Strange Sail. The signal made by the fisherman at once produced the strongest excitement on board the galleon. He waved the flag again three times, and then was seen rapidly to descend the mountain towards the boat. He had no sooner leaped into it, than it put off towards the ship; the rowers pulling in the most vigorous manner. `There is no doubt we are in for it Don Julio,' said Captain Baptista, looking at his first lieutenant. `The vessel seen by the pescador can be no other than that of the English corsair. But he can have no wind yet and must be lying still upon the water. In the meanwhile we must prepare for all emergencies.' `The bullion must be first removed,' said Don Ferdinand. `There is a landing of white sand at the foot of the precipice just beyond that group of olive trees growing in that crevice; and from the sand I discern a path leading doubtless to the monastery on the height. Let the sailors land it there.' `The place must first be examined, your excellency,' answered the captain. If it should not be a path and we land the silver, we shall only place it there for this corsair Kidd easier to take possession of. I have hopes, however, as this inlet cannot be seen from outside, that we shall lay here undisturbed. Then if he goes by he will probably steer for St. Ana and along the coast after us; while we can make the best of our way into Genoa, which is not two days sail from here. There we can wait till a ship of the line from Spain comes to convoy us back to our port.' `I will go myself in a boat and examine this landing,' said Don Ferdinand. `I am not only interested in saving the bullion, but in the safety of my daughter. I would know if in the last extremities there is a means of retreating from the ship and gaining the monastery.' `In the meanwhile, your excellency, `I will put the galleon in the best condition possible to give this freebooter a good reception, should he scent out our hiding place and venture in here.' `If he suspects we are here he will venture in, we may rest satisfied,' said Julio: `I am told he is as bold as he is successful, knows no fear and never counts odds!' `It is a pity the seas were not well rid of him,' said his excellency. `Do you know of any one who has ever seen him, senor capitan?' asked Dona Elena with a glow of interest. `Not I, nor do I wish to see him myself,' answered Capitan Baptista with a Castillian shrug of his shoulders. `I know a person, senorita, who knew him, having been taken prisoner by him,' said Julio, the lieutenant, fixing his handsome eyes admiringly upon the face of the beautiful Spanish maiden. `And did he escape from his hands?' she asked earnestly. `No, he was liberated. The corsair had captured his ship and taken from it all that was of value and thus released him, giving him a piece of gold stamped with a hand holding a sword, to show that he had once fallen into his hands, and that henceforth he should never suffer capture or injury by him or his captains!' `Yes, I am told he gives three pieces of stamped gold to those he has robbed,' said Capitan Baptista. The Holy Virgin forbid it should ever be my lot to have a present of one!' `How did your friend say this bold Corsair looked?' enquired Dona Elena. `I have heard he was young and noble in person, as also in birth.' `There is no question but he belongs to a good family in England,' said Julio. `He was at one period a commander in their navy; but being entrusted in the Indian seas with certain large treasures to transport from that country to England he proved treacherous to the trust and appropriated them. He then hoisted the free flag upon his ship and took the seas for his field of adventure. He has since then made every sea familiar with his terrible name, and although he has repeatedly lost his ships by wreck, fire and battle, he seems himself possessed of a charmed life and prosperous fortune. At times he has had as many as seven sail under his command, and other times he has been reduced to a small schooner.' `He is now in a brig,' observed the captain, `and I fear before night will be promoted to a ship! But we can do our best!' `Did your friend describe him!' asked Dona Elena again of the young lieutenant. `Your pardon, senora. He described him thus: a man about eight and thirty, under sized, with a compact, well knit frame, surmounted by a large yet finely shaped head, covered with black locks. These swept his broad, firm shoulders, and his raven beard swept his breast. He had a high forehead, commanding in its aspect, and brows large and projecting, and deeply shading eyes of the most determined fire and energy of expression. His nose was aquiline and his mouth finely chiselled, and indicative of great bravery; yet at times it could wear a smile of exceeding amenity. My friend further added that he had a small and graceful hand, of which he was exceedingly vain, and which was always heavily loaded with the most costly rings. In his costume he was rather rude than gallant, being attired in a plain gray velvet doublet, and a short cloak of blue Flanders cloth without lace. He wore usually a British marine hat, with the broad brim flapping down at the sides, but raised in front above his forehead by a silver button. His step was firm and active: his eye quick and penetrating, and always in a state of restless motion; and when he was talking he had a habit of continually drawing on and off his right glove, which he always wore to preserve the whiteness of his hands. The tones of his voice in ordinary conversation were even and manly and agreeable to the ear; but in the excitement of battle or in anger they were like the blast of a bugle!' `I thank you, Don Julio, for your description of this fearful corsair,' said Dona Elena, who had listened to the lieutenant with interest; and with an expression of admiration at what she heard than of fear. Is it true that he is so cruel as he has been represented?' she inquired. `I have no question of it, senora. He has doubtless slain or commanded to be slain, hundreds of unfortunate men. It is known that he has burned captured vessels with all their crews and passengers!' The cheek of the maiden blanched, and a shudder of horror passed over her frame. Her attention was now drawn to her father, who was about to proceed in a boat to the beach of white sand, a cable's length from the ship, to explore a path up to the monastery, for the purpose of securing a retreat. He had only delayed leaving the deck until the return on board of the boat which had conveyed the fisherman across the basin. This was now close along side, and all eyes were bent upon it as it rapidly advanced with the pescador standing up in the stern. The boat had hardly struck the side before the active young Corsican had climbed up the lofty sides of the galleon and stood upon her deck. `Well, senor pescador?' demanded Don Ferdinand de Garcia in an earnest tone. `The news! What saw you?' `A vessel, my lord, about a league and a half to the northward of the Nez head.' `What class was she?' demanded Capitan Baptista. `A brig she seemed to be, senor!' `Seemed? Do you not know a brig from any other vessel?' `She was standing stern on so both of her masts ranged in one in the way I saw her!' `Standing on! It is a dead calm!' `It is calm here, senor, but outside there is a fine four knot breeze. The wind blew my cap from my head as I stood upon the top of the hill.' This information was received in appalling silence. One of their hopes in which they trusted had vanished. `Was she visibly moving through the water?' demanded Capitan Baptista. `As well as I could discern, senor.' `And standing south?' asked Don Ferdinand. `Yes, your excellency.' `From what point is the wind?' inquired the captain, thoughtfully. `From the north-west. The vessel has it nearly aft!' `Did you see any other sail besides her?' `No, senor capitan. As soon as I had discovered her and made the signal, I doscended the hill to report to you.' `You were right, pescador. Your excellency, I think there can be little doubt that this is the pirate brig.' `It is our duty to provide for our own defence and security, whether it be or not, senor capitan. I will at once proceed in the boat to the foot of the path and see where it leads. Dona Elena, I would rather you would accompany me; as in case the galleon should be attacked here as she lies, I wish you to be in safety.' `I do not fear, father, but these brave officers will defend the galleon,' answered the maiden. `But their bravery cannot protect you from the shot. I would have you on shore in the security which yonder overhanging monastery would seem to afford. I can see some of the holy fathers looking down upon us from the battlement over its cloisters.' As Don Ferdinand assisted his daughter into the barge and followed himself, the officer posted upon the top of the cliff suddenly electrified every one by calling out in a loud voice—`A brig is coming into sight to the northward!' `You see, senor capitan,' said Don Ferdinand, we have no time to lose.' And he pushed off from the ship and was pulled rapidly ashore. `How far off is she?' shouted Capitan Baptista to his second lieutenant. `About half a league to the north of the promontory, and about two leagues distant from here!' `Is it the corsair?' `I think it is, senor! Can you send me up a spy-glass?' A young cadet, slinging a telescope across his shoulders, lightly sprung with it into the rigging, and in a few moments was standing upon the summit of the cliff. The officer took it from him, and while he levelled it at the distant vessel all eyes were watching him and every ear intent to hear his reply. Even Don Ferninand bade his boatmen to cease rowing until the response was given. `It is the pirate, senor!' he answered in a positive tone. `I can make out her signal aloft, the red arm grasping a sabre on a white ground. Her black flag is not flying or is hid by the spanker. But it is the same vessel that we have been flying from. She has got a very short fore-mast with a top-mast and topgallant-mast up above it! I can distinctly count her ports! She is standing south about a mile from the land, and carrying all sail!' `The saints carry her by without discovering us,' responded the Captain with a look of anxiety and trouble. `Now my brave crew we see what is before us if we happen to be found out. I am resolved to defend the ship to the last. I know there is not a Spaniard on board that will not second me! Do not shout! We must keep as still as we may be. I shall expect you to obey my orders without question. There is no prospect of saving any part of the bullion by sending it on shore. The time is too brief. I must use every minute to place the galleon in a state of defence. We must fight to the last, and when all is done, blow up the ship! She shall not become a prize to the freebooter!' The brave captain now ordered his officer upon the rock to lie close so as not to be discovered, and report every few moments the motions of the brig in the offing. In the meanwhile he prepared to place his vessel in the best condition of defence he possibly could, if the enemy should enter the basin and attack him. Don Ferdinand, on reaching the white beach at the foot of the precipitous cliff leaped on shore followed by Dona Elena. `I will go up the path with you, senor,' she said, as he prepared to ascend a broad crevice or cleft in the cliff which was worn with footsteps. Though steep the way was by no means difficult, as in every few yards steps had been cut into the rock by the monks. After a few minutes toil they reached a level green spot where they came to a spring gushing from a solid block of stone. By its side was chained an iron dipper. Here both drank freely of the cool water, which tasted delightfully after being so long accustomed to the flat and brackish water on shipboard. The breeze from the sea reached them here and refreshed them. There was yet a path still higher to ascend before they could reach the monastery. After glancing down into the sileut calm basin, where lay the galleon almost beneath them, so that every movement upon her decks was visible, they again commeneed their ascent, and at length stood upon a broad platform of rock directly under the walls of the monastery. Here they stopped to breathe and turned to look around them. Far deeper than before below lay their ship moored against the sheer precipice. On the rocky pinnacle above her masts they saw on a level with themselves the young officer who was stationed on the lookout, and from time to time could hear his report of the motions of the brig. The vessel they also could now see themselves. She was now nearly abreast of the basin and not more than a league distant. `She is going past sir,' said Elena, clasping her hands earnestly together as she watched the distant object of so much interest to all. `I trust she will pass us, daughter, but I fear the worst. Doubtless this coast, and all its sheltering places are well known to this bold corsair. I have no confidence in our security. Now that I have discovered a means of ascent, I shall return to the galleon, and on the first intimation that she changes her course towards the land, I shall have a hundred men at work transferring my own as well as the crown's gold to boats and conveyed up this height. In one hour's time it can be all in safety in this convent.' `The brig is surely standing on past, sir!' cried Dona Elena. `She seems standing towards St. Ana certainly I will delay a moment or two to watch her movements. While you are observing her I will rap at the gate and acquaint the holy men here with our condition.' While he spoke a postern opened within the greater gate of the seaward wall of the convent, and a monk of large stature, aged about forty, and attired in the costume of the Benedictine order, came forth and approached them. `Benedicite, brother! benedicite, sister!' he said, elevating his hands in the act of blessing them. `You are strangers and came from the ship below!' `We are Spaniards father, and we gladly perceive by your tongue that you are also of Spain. Our ship is a richly laden galleon from Mexico.— We have been driven past our port and through the straits by a storm, and at the same time chased by a pirate who prevented us regaining our port.— We steered eastward, hoping to reach Genoa, but as in an action with him yesterday we were somewhat disabled, we last night put in here hoping to elude him, and trusting he would pass us by supposing we had steered for St. Ana!' `This then accounts for the unusual appearance of this large ship in our bay, which few craft but fisher's visit. You are welcome brother to our convent. Has your pursuer past?' `He has just appeared in sight round yonder promontory, father. We left him disabled yesterday many leagues to the north and west of this, and at dark lost sight of him. But now we see he has repaired his injuries and is again in chase. He seems to be passing by without suspecting our presence here!' `He is steering for the port of St. Ana,' said the monk looking steadily at the brig. `It is possible he is ignorant of this inlet, as the fishermen tell me its entrance is not visible to vessels passing. This is your daughter, brother?' said the monk, gazing with a subdued yet admiring glance upon the noble person and beautiful countenance of the Castilian maiden. `It is father. She is the only child of the ancient house of De Garcia.' `De Garcia is a noble lineage. Do I then address the Count de Garcia, late Governor of New Spain?' `I am Ferdinand de Garcia, father. I fear if yonder freebooter discovers our hiding-place, I shall have to trespass upon your hospitality.' `You are welcome, son. Our monastery, though one wing of it is ruinous, is strong. Besides, this will be a sanctuary this sea-robber dare not invade, even if he destroy thy vessel!' `I fear me father he will have little respect for convent walls. He is an English heretic. But if you have within your monastery secret vaults where gold could be concealed even if the edifice were sacked, I should like to place in them two millions of bullion, should this pirate discover this inlet and seek us here.' `There are chambers beneath the foundations that no human eye or skill could detect,' said the monk with a sparkfing eye and in an earnest tone.— `They shall be at once opened and made ready for the reception of your treasures!' `Thanks, good father. I am more at ease that I know this. Now I will watch from here the motions of our enemy. You have a vast and sublime view from this eminence, father. What is the name of your religious house?' `The monastery of San Elisco. It has been richly endowed but now we are poor. Besides myself, who am the prior of the monastery, and four brothers of humble degree, there are none of the order occupying it. Its treasures have been loaned to different powers to prosecute wars against the infidel and never repaid. We are very poor! Rich men do not bequeath their wealth now as formerly to the church. A little of the gold that goes to building up human vanity, would render this monastery once more respectable and influential. Once it numbered two hundred and fifty brothers, and had a domain twelve leagues square with one thousand tenantry, and an income of seventy thousand ducats. Now it has no lands but the rock its foundation stands upon; but four brothers of the order who subsist on charity, and but two or three peasant-retainers.' `It is a great falling off, father,' answered Don Ferdinand, who seemed however to answer mechanically, as if he was thinking more about the brig than about the poverty of which the ambitious Benedictine complained.— The monk bit his lips, and then fixed his eyes stealthily upon the fair countenance of the maiden, who, with earnest eyes, her lips just parted and her person bent forward in eager watchfulness she kept her gaze fastened upon the slowly passing Corsair's ship. The anxiety on board the galleon each moment increased and the officer upon the rock had as much as he could manage to keep watch on the brig and at the same time answer the numerous shouts of Capitan Baptista; who but for his unwieldy weight would have gone himself up aloft and taken a position upon the summit of the rock to observe with his own eyes her movements. `There can only be one way by which our presence here can be known to him,' said Dona Elena, suddenly turning to address her father. As she did so she met the eye of the monk full with her own, and starting she blushed with confusion and surprise; for no woman could mistake the deep gaze of admiration which he was regarding her. `What way?' asked Don Ferdinand. `Through the fishermen who have left the inlet. I see four or five out at sea, and if the brig should question any of them we are betrayed!' This is true indeed! We should have prevented any of them quitting the inlet while we remained here. He is evidently steering for one now!' `They are honest men and would not be likely to betray your presence to pirates,' said the monk; who had with an effort recovered his self-possession, which for a moment he had lost on so unexpectedly being detected by the maiden gazing upon her. `The fisherman flies. Look! She fires!' exclaimed Dona Elena, turning pale; and a cloud of smoke was seen to roll from the brig's bows, and the next moment the dull report of a gun reached them. `The boat has come to!' repeated Don Ferdinand in the same breath. `The brig has hove to, senor capitan!' shouted a moment afterwards Don Carlos from his rock down to the deck of the galleon. The announcement created the utmost consternation, and a hundred eyes were turned up towards him. `She has hove to to speak a fishing boat!' I see it now under her stern!' shouted the officer. `Then the galleon is as good as blown up!' cried Capitan Baptista with vexation. `I have feared that. I ought to have kept every fishing craft close in the basin. Por San Diego! The game is up; and all we have got to do is to stand at bay the best way we can!'</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER III. The Fight. The brig had indeed hove to! From sailing steadily along at the rate of five knots and standing on direct for Santa Ana, and while those who were watching her with such intense interest, were about congratulating each other upon her being well past their place of concealment, she all at once came up into the wind, laid her main-topsail aback and became stationary. We will transfer the reader on board of her, not at this moment however when she heaves to, but about half an hour previous when first discovered by the fisherman. At this period she was standing towards the Nez Head under a crowd of sail, and showed herself to be a brig of about two hundred and eighty tons, rising very high out of the water, but without a poop-deck, being flush fore and aft. Her masts were low and stunted, and the fore-mast was but two-thirds its proper height, being composed of two short spars fitted together; so that in order that she might carry a foresail it had to be set close-reefed. Her upper sails and spars were of the usual proportions. She was painted black with a scarlet band running round her waist, and with red-lining to her ports, which were raised, displaying eight large guns to a side. Her yards were painted red and exceedingly square, giving her immense breadth of canvass. Her bulwarks were the height of a man's head, and her hammock nettings were stowed like those of a man of war. She was exceedingly broad in the beam, and built very much after the model of the Portuguese slavers of that day, though her aspect was far more warlike. She had a heavy appearance, with her stunted masts, high quarters and full bows, yet sailed with case and rapidity, rising and falling to the long ground swell with a graceful onward movement. Upon her quarter deck stood two persons besides the man at the helm.— They were watching in silence the sunlight kindling the summits of the mountains of the island, along which they were sailing. Amidships upon the deck or upon gun-carriages lay two or three men asleep, who by their dress were officers of the brig. Forward and between the guns were grouped a large number of dark looking men with visages marked by crime. Some of them were smoking, others conversing, others were calmly asleep. The wind moved the brig so steadily along that the services of no one on board were called for save those of the helmsman. The two persons upon the quarter-deck were very opposite in appearance and aspect. One of them was a young man of three or four and twenty, tall and well made with a clear blue eye, fair flowing hair, and a pleasant expression about his finely chiseled mouth, united with a look of singular decision and daring. He was smoking a cigar, and leaning over the high carved quarter-railing that like a balustrade surrounded the quarter-decks of vessels of that period. A light blue cap sat carelessly yet becomingly upon his head; and he wore a loose, embroidered jacket of navy-blue, with small clothes of black velvet adorned with gold buttons. His stockings were of black silk, and in his shoes glittered buckles set with diamonds.— His air was at once free and bold and such as become one who, if not the captain of the brig was at least on familiar terms with the individual who was so. This individual stood but a pace or two from him. He was a man of middle stature, firmly built and precisely answered to the description given of the Corsair Kidd, by the young Spanish officer to Dona Elena; with this difference, that he now wore a mustache instead of a sweeping beard; and was dressed richly in black velvet. He wore a magnificent sword by his side, the belt of which was set with precious stones. A single diamond of great beauty and size blazed in the hilt. His sombrero was beneath his arm, and he leaned upon his sheathed sword as he stood watching the land. His fine, large head, with its massive mane of black locks that covered his broad shoulders, appeared to the best effect as the sun fell upon his brow and lighted it up, giving at the same time darkness and depth far more intense to the dark eyes that darted forth their penetrating glances beneath his heavy brows. His appearance was singularly commanding, yet at the same time terrible. If he but glanced at the helmsman, the man started and shrunk from his observation, and when he looked forward the voices of his men sunk into a whisper. Suddenly he threw his eagle eye aloft! `Are you alert? What do you discover?' he called in a stern, deep-toned voice to a man at the mast-head, and speaking in English. `I see nothing in sight, sir!' answered the man; and as he answered he fixed his gaze more earnestly on the sea ahead of the vessel. `When we double this headland we shall be able to take a clear sweep of the coast with the eye,' said the pirate captain glancing from the young man who was standing near him towards the Nez Head. `The Galleon has at least six hours advantage of us, captain,' replied his lieutenant, and by this time is safely auchored in Port St. Ana.' `If she passed that port she is now not more than ten leagues ahead of us, for the most of the night there was no wind. With this breeze we shall soon get round this headland and then be able to see for a long distance from aloft. If she is not in sight there is no doubt she will have run into St. Ana.' `And in that case?' asked the young man drily. `I shall take her out!' `Is there no fortress there?' `Yes—but ill-manned, and with but half a dozen poor guns. I could silence it in five minutes, and for that matter take the town.' `The galleon will be enough for once, if you get possession of her, captain,' said he, smiling. `Yes. She has given me too long a chase for me to think of letting her off lightly. She must have at least a million of dollars on board in pure silver! This is one of the heavily armed ships that are always selected for the transportation of the treasures from the mines of Mexico to Spain.— What ho! aloft?' `I see nothing, sir, but a fishing boat just coming out from under the land!' answered the man. `We must fall in with her! Helmsman, keep your eye on the boat and steer so as to intercept it. We may learn something from him, my lord!' `Yes,' responded the young man, coolly blowing the blue smoke from his lips. They possibly may be able to give some information, if the galleon passed so near the island as to be seen from the shore!' `If she is not in sight when we round this headland, we shall find her in St. Ana. The wind has been such that it is impossible she can have run out of sight in the night, being full in view at sunset; and since then I know we have made a better rate of sailing than she has done, judging from the past progress of the chase!' `This has been a long chase, captain!' `Not so long as one I had three years ago in the southern ocean. I fell in with a homeward bound Indiaman off Madras and gave chase to her. I was then in a large ship heavily armed and well manued; the same as I told you I after wards lost in the Brazils. The Indiaman sailed well, and as the trades were blowing, we had a fair race for eleven days before I came within gun-shot. To keep this distance I could see her every three or four hours pitch a gun or two into the sea, or some heavy merchandise, till at length she was as light as a lugger in ballast.' 2 `Did you eventually capture her?' asked the young man in a careless tone, at the same time lighting a fresh cigar. `No, my lord. I brought her at last within range, when a white squall struck me and carried away my mizzen mast, which went over the side taking yards and sails. When it cleared away again the Indiaman was hull down ahead, having carried every stitch of canvass in the gale to run away from me. So I lost him, But this galleon I do not mean to lose in this way. Ho! my glass here?' he cried with animation. At the command an African, who, with his long arms and hideous visage, resembled an ourangoutang more than a man, spring up through the sky-light with it and placed it in his hand. When he had done so he stepped behind his master and folded his long apish hands upon his hairy breast with an air of the most solemn gravity. His costume was as extraordinary as his personal appearance. He wore a long scarlet cap, and scarlet breeches fringed with silver thread. His black body was naked from his waist upward. A gold collar band encircled his neck, on which was engraved the words— “Cinqua, the property of Kidd.” His wrists were loaded with brass and silver bracelets, not unlike those worn by the American Indians; and long gold rings depended from the lappets of his long ears. About each naked ancle were half a dozen brass rings highly polished; for most of Cinqua's leisure time was employed in keeping these and his other ornaments. He seemed to possess no other attribute of intellect than cunning. His monkey-looking face expressed a singular union of fear and malice. The corsair placed the spy-glass to his eye, and levelled it in the direction of the shore towards an eminence that rose beyond the promontory. After a moment he exclaimed—`There is meaning in that!' `In what?' asked the other with interest. `I saw what appeared to be a flag waving on yonder hill and sent for my glass. It shows me a man upon the bill who, as I was looking, waved the flag three times above his head and has now disappeared. This must be a signal either to us, or to others! Take the glass, my lord! Do you see any thing further?' `Nothing. It is strange?' `What news aloft?' called out the corsair eagerly. `Nothing in sight, sir!' `We are fast rounding the headland. In a few moments we shall see the tower of St. Ana about eight miles distant!' `I see it now, captain,' said the young man sweeping the range of view with his glass. `We have just this moment opened it round the head of the promontory!' `I see it with my naked eye. Now in a few minutes we shall be able to command the whole coast for miles beyond St. Ana, as well as that the promontory has been concealing from us. I will aloft with my glass and take a look into St. Ana! I discover from the deck the masts of two or three vessels in the port!' As he spoke the pirate captain threw himself into the rigging and was soon standing in the main-topgallant cross-trees surveying the coast with his glass. `I can look distinctly into St. Ana. There is no large vessels there. I discover only a few small Italian polaccas and fishing boats! I have swept the coast beyond and the sea on all sides but see nothing. I can discern the blue summits of Tuscany but not a vessel lies in the range of my eyes in any direction!' `Perhaps she has run across to the Italian coast,' answered the young man from the deck. `There has been no wind to enable her to do this! She would have been now visible if she had attempted it!' After a second close observation of the sea and the coast both above and below the port of St. Ana, the corsair descended to the deck. His face was dark and gloomy with disappointment. `What in your opinion has become of the galleon?' asked the young man. `That she is lying hid in St. Ana, perhaps behind the fort, with her masts housed to prevent their showing above the fort. It is clearly impossible she could have got out sight by morning, when she was visible at sundown, and since then we have had the same wind and the same chances she has had! I shall run strait for St. Ana and search the port! How? That fisherman is scudding from us landward?' `There is another farther out, sir,' said the helmsman. `I see him! Luff a little and get between him and the shore. These fellows are usually out all night, and doubtless have seen the galleon if she passed this way!' The brig's course was changed a little to cut off the fisherman from the shore, while the other boat was flying rapidly in towards the land, as if from a suspicion of the dangerous character of the strange vessel. While the brig was moving on along the land about two miles distant, Captain Kidd was constantly busy with his glass, ranging both the shore line and the horizon seaward. He came abreast of the inlet into which the galleon had gone, but without discovering the entrance, as the face of the cliff seemed entirely unbroken. The town of St. Ana, with its turrets and harbor, was now clearly visible, and having inspected it closely he said—`I am satisfied the galleon does not lie in there. The fort is so low upon the water that her battlement would not conceal a ship of her size even with her topmasts housed. It is my opinion she has run into some other harbor along the coast! What are you watching so closely, my lord?' `That fishing craft which run away at our approach. She this moment disappeared as if she had gone into the very side of the cliff!! `Then there is some opening there into which she has run,' cried the consair quickly. `But here we are nearly up with the fisherman and will soon learn.' `He has followed the example of his fellow,' said the young man, laughing, as the fisherman hoisted his sail and began to scud. `Throw a shot over him!' said the corsair to one of his officers in the waist. The man went forward, depressed and levelled one of the two guns and fired. The ball was seen to strike the water not a hundred yards beyond the fishing boat. `There comes down his sail as quickly as it went up,' said Kidd, sternly. In a few moments afterwards the brig had come up with the lugger, and he was ordered to come alonside; but clumsily working his craft through fright, the man fell to leeward, and Kidd ordered the brig to be hove to for him to reach her. In a few minutes, the lugger, which contained two men came alongside, and one of the fishermen was ordered on board the pirate. `Does your boat belong in St. Ana?' demanded Kidd. `Si, senor,' answered the man, taking off his blue woolen cap.' `When did you leave the port?' `At day break, senor.' `Was there a Spanish galleon lying there?' `No, senor.' The man's reply was prompt enough, and the corsair believed him; but there rose to the countenance of the fisherman afterwards, a peculiar involuntary expression which could not escape the penetrating eye of the pirate. `You have seen this galleon,' he said sternly. `No, senor,' answered the man, trembling. `You know of her! I read it in your eye. Deceive or trifle with me at your peril!' he said in a terrific voice, at the same time taking a pistol from the rack round the main-mast. `I will tell your worship all I know, if you will spare my life, and let me and my poor boat go free?' `I would not harm your miserable life, picaro. Speak! What is it you know?' `I told you truly I had not seen the galleon, senor. But a comrade of mine, whom I met out on the water this morning, told me that a large armed ship had put into the Gancho Basin last night, and was lying hid in the deep water behind the rocks!' `This is great news, by the holy rood!' cried Kidd, his fierce eye lighting up with a smile. `Now where is this Gancho basin, fellow?' `It lieth in there away, your worship,' said the man pointing towards the very spot where the young man had seen the fishing-craft so mysteriously disappear. `Do you mock me, fellow? I see nothing!' `The entrance cannot be seen from here, senor. It can only be discovered when close to it. Inside is a deep basin, half a mile across, where the largest ships can ride. The monastery you see on the height yonder, looks right down into the basin.' `And this ship you speak of lies therein?' `So I am told, senor.' `Do you know the passage?' `Si, senor! It is very crooked. The Galleon could not have gone in without a pilot!' `Then remain you and be my pilot! Your comrade shall go adrift with your lugger and come and get you in shore when I have done with you!' The poor man beut his head in silence, and then by the command of the pirate the brig being once more underweigh, stood by the helm and directed the steersman how to steer towards the rock. The brig instead of running free as before was now laid up to the wind and went dashing the spray before her in the direction of the invisible entrance. An air of triumph and revenge marked the dark visage of the corsair as he stood watching the cliff and from time to time endeavoring to make out with his glass the opening towards which his vessel was rapidly advancing. `Now is our success certain, Belfort! This can be no other than the chase!' he said, addressing the young man who was passing thoughtfully up and down the deck. `Yes.' `You are strangely dull, my lord! This is a time of triumph and mirth! The galleon is ours!' `I am not over and above cheerful this morning, captain,' said Belfort. `Methinks you are changed since last we sailed together! Being three years on shore has made a monk of you. Well—a cruise or two with me will make you as good as ever! Do you know, that falling in with you at Gibraltar, I regarded one of the best fortunes that could befal me! I have missed your courage and talents the last three years! You have done well to spurn an idle life on shore and take to the sea once more!' `I have no doubt I shall do better by and by,' he answered with a smile. At the same moment, Kidd turned away to look for the entrance; and as he did so the clear blue eyes of the young man rested for a brief space upon his face with an expression of calm superiority and defiance. He instantly banished it, however, for the careless look of indifference which he previously wore. It was very clear from this that there was only an outward good-understanding between the two; that while with one the feeling of companionship was cordial; with the other it was assumed! that the consair had an enemy in the man he trusted! This young man had been a midshipman on board the very ship of war, on the deck of which Kidd had first openly withdrawn allegiance to the king and raised the free flag. He was one of the young officers whom he had corrupted to his views by tales of chivalrous and romantic adventure upon the high seas; tempting them with the idea of capturing ships laden with the gold of Peru and Mexico, and making captive the beautiful daughters of the Indian emperors and princes, and establishing on some Island Paradise of the western world an empire of pleasure, beauty and love! To such tales did young Belfort listen; and, taken with the pictures of luxury and wealth of the artful leader, nearly all the young officers joined in annulling their allegiance to the British crown, and in hoisting the free flag of the seas. Such was the origin of the first piratical act of the young English officer, whose name, subsequently as the corsair Kidd, filled all lands with its sanguinary fame. At first he had pursued in some measure a course against which his followers felt no repugnance. He laid his ship before some small towns and placed them under contributions, but without using violence. But gradually as his lawlessness and love of wealth increased, he did not hesitate to burn, pillage and slay where he met with resistance. His force increased to several vessels, within two years, and over each of these was placed an officer who had served under him. These commanders met with various reverses. Some deserted their chief and cruised in distant seas on their own account, while others were taken and executed. To Belfort the corsair had become attached, and always kept him with him on board his own vessel as his next in command. This young man was noted for his courage and daring, and also for his humanity, which presented a singular contrast to the blood-thirsty spirit of his captain. At length he became weary and disgusted with the exercises of this wild career of war against mankind, and taking an opportunity he made known his intentions to Kidd to leave the sea forever and dwell in England. After some reluctance, Kidd acquiesced in his wishes, and they parted in London on the most friendly terms. Belfort remained in England under an assumed name, and in disguise visited his father who was a baronet and the son of an earl. To him he made a full confession of his past life and his purpose of becoming a man of honor; and this gentleman spent nearly two years in vain exertions to get his son's pardon of the king; though without letting his majesty know he was in England, but assuring him that he had left the service of Kidd.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER IV. The Pirate's Lieutenant. The baronet at length died without effecting his object, and soon afterwards the death of an elder brother made Belfort heir to the carldom. He learned that the estates were about to be confiscated and his title extinguished; when he resolved to make a bold attempt to see the king and cast himself upon his mercy. He succeeded in getting an interview with his majesty and after an hour's audience, he left the royal presence successful! The king had pardoned him, and authorised him to inherit his estates and title; but upon a condition which he was personally to fulfil! This condition he made known to no one. Till it was successfully accomplished his audience with the king was to be held secret. A day or two afterwards, he suddenly left England for Gibraltar. His first enquiries on landing there were, if the corsair Kidd was cruising, as was reported, in the neighborhood of the straits. He ascertained that this was the fact; and to his surprise the very next day he saw walking the streets of Gibraltar one of his men, whom he well knew. Pretending still to be one of them he learned from him that the corsair was lying not far up the coast, taking in water and provisions and making repairs. The man led him to a boat at the quay, in which he and several other pirates had come to the city; and with them Belfort returned to the vessel. He was received by Kidd with every demonstration of joy, and at once told if he would remain with him, he should have command of the first ship he should capture. `I mean to remain with you, captain, he said frankly; `I am tired of the land. I suppose you know I have inherited a title, but the king publicly declared my estates confiscated and my title extinguished?' `Yes. I saw the news in an English Gazette which I found on board a merchantman I captured. I then said that I well knew it was with the hopes of getting this title that you left me; and I added that you were ours again now you had lost it, if I ever fell in with you again! You see I was right!' `What are you now doing?' asked Belfort. `I am watching for Spanish galleons! I have captured three the last three months, but two of them had thrown overboard all their silver, for which I made coffins of the hulls, and sent them down scuttled beneath the sea with all on board!' `You must be rich!' `No. I handle a great deal of treasure, but there are so many rogues to share it that it goes but little ways. Besides it takes a large sum to buy diamonds!' `Are you still as fond of diamonds as ever?' `Yes, quite so! It is the only wealth becoming a true gentleman! Gold and silver are earth! See! Here is one I have had set in Paris lately. I gave two hundred thousand silver pesos for it! Here is a brooch containing a diamond sun encircled by seven stars! It cost me the whole freight of a Mexican galleon, and that was half a million. If I took a galleon every day it would be only a diamond a day more!' `Your wealth in diamonds must be enormous, captain!' `About five or six millions pounds sterling!' `And do you carry them all with you?' `Yes. In rings as you see, brooches, buckles, clasps, sword belts, &amp;c. I have most of them in a casket under my pillow!' `I should think you would fear your men!' `They do not value diamonds! They would rather have the baser visible wealth of coins. I can keep my wealth without fear of being robbed of it while I let the dogs roll in silver dollars. Here is a stone I took from the finger of a Mexican lady,' he said, withdrawing his glove and exhibiting his shapely fair hand covered with jewels! `It sparkles with a crimson light and is very singular and valuable!' `Well, I am glad to see you so prosperous, captain!' said Belfort. `And you shall share equally with me. I need a friend and companion. I have never been able to make up your loss to me. Your appearance on board has made a new man of me!' `Where do you cruise next?' `I am expecting a fleet of galleons from Mexico, and hope to cut one of them off. They will be near port in a few days. I shall sail tomorrow and be on the lookout for them!' `I accompany you,' said Belfort with animation, but `on one condition!' `Name it,' said the pirate. `That whether successful or not in capturing one of these silver freighted galleons, you will visit the coast of England!' `There are too many of the king's cruisers in the channel, and some of them would be likely to make a trap for me. No, my good lord Belfort! I have resolved if I do not fall in with any ship here to sail westward for the West Indies and cruise in those waters, and so run down to New York and Boston. There is always plenty of specie on board the King's vessels in those seas! The young noble reflected a few moments and then said cheerfully, `Be it so, captain. I will go with you,' answered the young man, impressively. `I swear here never to part from you so long as you have a deck beneath your feet!' Kidd grasped his hand warmly, and the compact was sealed by him over a flask of wine which was drank in goblets of chased gold. The next day the pirate vessel got underweigh, and the following day fell in with the galleon, cut her off from her port and gave chase. This was now the eighth day since this persevering chase had commenced. The brig now kept her way rapidly and steadily towards the cliff, and when within a third of a mile, just as Kidd began to suspect his new pilot intended to wreck him upon the iron rocks, the opening was visible like a narrow cleft in the precipice. Each instant it enlarged, and in a little while they saw widen before them a passage broad enough for three or four ships to enter. Beyond reposed a dark, still basin shut in by the sides of the descending mountains. The corsair had leaped into the rigging on first discovering the passage, and stood there watching the opening of the basin with a keen and triumphant glance. In the meanwhile, the movements of the pirate-vessel had been closely watched by all those so deeply interested in the safety of the Galleon. Don Ferdinand, on seeing her tack after speaking the fisherman and stand directly for the inlet, had hastened to the water-side, while Carlos from his rock at the same time communicated the startling intelligense to the deck of the ship. As Don Ferdinand reached it he found every thing in a state of determined defence. `It is madness fo attempt to fight him off, Capitan Baptista,' cried the ex-Governor. `He will surely board you sword in hand. With your permission I will land as much of the bullion as can be set on shore. The head of the monastery tells me he has secret vaults where it will be safe, should the pirates even go so far as to take possession of that edifice.' `I can spare my men till the corsair enters the basin, when I shall want them,' answered Captain Baptista, with decision.' `I must defend my vessel at all odds!' The crew were immediately employed in discharging the boxes, kegs and ox-hide sacks of gold and silver into the boats alongside; and as each was loaded it pulled for the foot of the pathway leading to the monastery. Here the men landed with the treasures, and began, heavily loaded, to totter up the ascent. At the summit they were received by the padre, and passing by Dona Elena who was watching the pirate's approach, were conducted by him to the chapel of the convent, where they deposited the bullion upon the paved floor of the chancel. As the corsair's brig was full four miles distant when he tacked, Don Ferdinand, by great exertions, had succeeded in removing to the shore not only all his own boxes of treasure, but a million of dollars belonging to the crown. About half a million yet remained to be placed in the boats, when the upper sails of the brig were seen glancing above the rocky arms of the outer entrance to the basin, and within half a mile of them. She was standing in boldly with her coursers only drawn up, carrying every other sail. She evidently had a pilot, as she followed the intricacies of the channel with accuracy and boldness. On seeing her the Spanish capitan gave orders for his men to leave the money and fly to their guns while the drum beat to quarters. Don Ferdinand who was on board, although he would gladly have been by his daughter's side, whom he beheld looking down from the rock on which the monastery stood, still was too brave a man to leave the ship at such a crisis. He therefore stationed himself by the captain to give his advice and aid in emergency; not a little relieved to reflect that his child would be in safety during the approaching combat. The corsair came steadily in until she had passed the wall of rocks over which her upper sails had been seen, when she appeared full in view of the galleon from truck to deck within long musket shot distance. `Call on them to surrender, captain, before we attack; it will save bloodshed,' said Belfort, as they came in sight of her close under the cliff. `They are snugly hid away there, by the holy rood!' said the corsair with a grim smile as his eye took in her position. `Fisherman, you have earned your weight in gold! You shall be rewarded! Ha! They are prepared for our reception! Do you see, Belfort! every man is at his gun and matchlocks are alight. The tops and rocks above are crowded with musketeers! and see! on yonder crag is perched an artillery piece! This is not looking like wishing to surrender!' `Still demand it!' `Well, I will do so to gratify you, Belfort.' The pirate as he spoke sprung upon a gun and placed the trumpet to his mouth. His vessel had now fairly entered the basin and lay becalmed on its glassy waters about two hundred fathom abreast of the Spanish ship, all of her men at the guns. `Ho! the galleon!' `Ahoy!' answered Capitan Baptista. `Surrender, or I will sink you in five minutes!' The corsair waited an instant for a reply. The Spanish capitan waved his sword to his decks, and instantly the very rocks reeled with the roar of his guns as he discharged his broadside. Kidd sprung to the deck of his vessel amid the crashing of spars, with a visage like that of an enraged lion, and in a voice of thunder called upon his men to pour in their fire in return! For a few moments the heavens were filled with the roar of cannon. The cliff and mountain-sides echoing and re-echoing the heavy artillery, redoubled the sounds of the battle. The vast clouds of sulphurous smoke, without wind to bear it away, settled heavily upon the surface of the water, and concealed the hulls of the combating vessels from the sight of Dona Elena and those who looked down from the monastery. The voice of the corsair reached their ears above the thunder of broadsides and the crash of musketry. Carlos upon the rock was busily working his six-ponnder, and sending destruction at every discharge upon the decks of the brig. `This game will soon sink us!' cried Kidd, as grim with powder he approached Belfort, who stood upon the quarter-deck trying to look through the smoke at the enemy. `The rudder is shot away, and shot has entered under the water-line. We must board! There goes the main-topmast by the board! Ho, boats and boarders!' he cried in a loud voice. `Leave your guns and crowd the boats! We must carry her cutlass in hand!' Amid the terrific fire kept up by the galleon, four boats were filled with men and put off for the enemy amid the dense smoke. In the leading boat was the corsair; and in the next Belfort sword in hand. `What means this sudden silence on board the pirate?' asked Don Ferdinand, turning towards the Capitan Baptista. `They have ceased firing!' `Then I have sunk them or silenced them. But this smoke makes every thing as invisible as the darkest midnight! 'Tis strange! Do they think they have done us damage enough?' `Had we not better stop firing to see what this means?' `Yes!' and he gave orders accordingly. But he had scarcely done so when the dash of oars was heard close at hand, and, one after another, four boats filled with pirates shot out of the smoke and struck the sides of the galleon. Before the Spaniards could seize their weapons to repel them, they had clambered on board and attacked them forward and aft. After a short and ineffectual resistance the crew of the galleon were driven overboard into the water. Captain Baptista and Don Ferdinand defended the quarter deck with great bravery; but were both slain, although Belfort made every effort to save them from the savage vengeance of the pirates. Julio was the last slain as he attempted to defend the entrance of the cabin against Kidd, the corsair shooting him through the head with a pistol. In less than five minutes after boarding the galleon the pirates had her in their possession. The smoke gradually lifted and floated off from the vessel, when the pirate-brig was seen in the position in which she had been left and nearly in a sinking condition, with her masts shot away and her hull completely riddled with shot. Kidd instantly ordered a boat to go on board, into which he sprung and pulled for her. He boarded her and descending into the cabin in a few moments returned with a casket of jewels. The brig was settling fast. On her deck were strewn the dead and maimed, while others less severely wounded, piteously begged to be taken from her. The pirate had no ear of pity. He gave stern orders to pull back to the galleon, taking his slave Cinqua with him. As he reached it his brig gave a surge forward and heeling over, plunged heavily beneath the surface into the depths of the dark basin, leaving ringing in the ears of the pirate, the wailing shriek with which their wounded comrades filled the air as they were engulphed in the closing waters. `So that this ship is sound let her rest in peace,' said the corsair, as the topmast spar of his vessel disappeared from his sight. `Now we must see to securing our prize and providing for our own safety!' He had scarcely spoken when the report of a cannon was followed by a six pound shot, splintering the deck. He recollected the gun which had done him so much mischief in the action, and looking up beheld Carlos and three or four men loading it for another fire. There was a new enemy and from an unexpected quarter! Unless he could be dislodged the ship could not be held, for the gun, about two hundred feet above her, had the complete command of her decks. Kidd stood a moment irresolute! He then cried,—`A thousand pesos to the man that captures that gun!' Twenty of the pirates sprung into the rigging to reach the rock from the yards. The gun was discharged as eight of them were upon the fore-yard together, and the yard came down, shot from its slings, hurling the pirates to the deck. Others, more successful, reached the rock and began to ascend it, sabre in hand. Carlos and his men were without weapons. The pirates reached the summit and grappled with them. Two of the combatants, losing their footing, fell headlong to the deck mangled corpses. Two more were plunged down the face of the rock. Each of the remaining Spaniards clenched a pirate and sprung with him into the sea. Carlos remained alone, standing proudly upon his gun. He had singly hurled three of his assailants over the precipice. A sharp report came from the deck of the galleon and the blood spurted from his brow. He fell over dead upon his gun, clinging to it and clasping it in his dying embrace! The corsair having satisfied himself that the galleon was sound in her hull, and not materially injured in her spars, and having discovered a large amount of specie on board, he resolved to repair her with all speed and put to sea. To this end he at once proceeded to give orders. His first command was to tow her out of the inlet to the entrance where she could be under the influence of the breeze. Here he anchored her about a hundred fathom from the shore and prepared to fit her for sea. She was safely moored in her new ground about half an hour after he had taken possession of her; and by night he expected to be able to put to sea. The engagement and its result had been witnessed by Dona Elena from her position in front of the monastery; and it was with feelings of the deepest anguish she reflected, that while she stood in safety her father was in the midst of the scene of carnage and death upon which she gazed. The roar of the cannon appalled her soul, and she breathed prayer on prayer for his safety. The monks also knelt around her and prayed for the success of the Spaniard against the heretical buccaneer. When she saw that the galleon was at length in the hands of the pirates, and that her crew were driven overboard, she could not be restrained by the entreaties of the monks, but rushed towards the shore. When she reached the landing several of the crew of the galleon had landed; but of none of them could she obtain any intelligence of him. `We left him fighting hand to hand with the pirate chief,' said one. `And, craven, why did ye fly and leave him in danger?' `We fled for our lives, lady! The pirates had possession of the deck.— They surprised us!! At length a wounded man with difficulty attained the shore. `What news of my father?' she cried. `He is dead, lady. I saw him struck down—both he and Capitan Baptista!' The bereaved daughter uttered a piercing cry and fell insensible upon the beach. The Spanish sailors bore her in their arms up to the monastery gate along the path by which they had formerly conveyed the gold and silver, and placed her in charge of the prior. His eyes sparkled when he was told that the wealthy Spaniard who owned half the treasure which had been carried into the monastery had perished; but he opened not his lips. Sending one of his order for the wife of a vine-dresser, whose cot was near the wall of the monastery, he gave her into her charge with direction to use suitable means to restore her to consciousness. In the meanwhile the preparations for fitting the captured galleon for sea went rapidly forward; and by sunset of this eventful day she was in condition to sail. Her new master, as he stood on the quarter deck, surveyed her with a practiced eye and a look of stern satisfaction. `I have gained by the change, Belfort,' he said, complacently. `This vessel is newer than mine and will sail, as I have experienced, quite as well. She will also aid me in capturing others of her species. I could run into a fleet of these heavy bullion-freighted Spaniards now without suspicion. I think I shall carry the Spanish flag, and set my own only on emergencies!' Belfort said something indistinctly in reply, and then the corsair gave orders to weigh the anchor, every thing being ready. `Where now shall we sail?' asked Belfort. `Into the Atlantic.' `Dare you put in at Gibraltar?' `I am bold enough; but I would rather not,' he answered, laughing. `I have I find near a million of dollars on board, taking into account those jewels found in that female wardrobe below!' `I wonder what female was on board,' said Belfort with interest. `She was evidently of rank!' `No doubt. If I had taken a single prisoner I might have learned all.— But my men's blood was up and no soul was spared except those who swam to land Doubtless the lady was previously taken ashore!' `Perhaps so. I should regret it if she had perished!' `She certainly was not seen by any one when we boarded. If she had sprung overboard she must have been seen!' `Not in the thick smoke and confusion,' answered Belfort, sadly. `Well, she is in heaven then and I have her jewels,' answered the corsair with an unfeeling laugh. The eyes of the young man flashed, and he muttered to himself as he turned away from him, `Thy time will come ere long!'</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER V. The Prior. The sailing of the galleon, now become a corsair's ship, was watched from the monastery with no little interest by at least one person This was the prior, padre Eustaquio. He was standing in the eastern window of the corridor which overlooked the sea-board. At the first intimation that the pirates were getting underweigh a cloud of anxiety and mistrust that enveloped his features disappeared, and a cold exulting smile lighted up his proud austere countenance, like moon-beams breaking through wintry clouds. Something of Father Eustaquio's character has already been hinted at. He belonged to that class of ambitious ecclesiastics, at that day more numerous and powerful than at present, who would see the church rich in this world's goods as well as in spiritual. He mourned over the degeneracy and heretical tendency of the age, which withheld from the coffers of the mother church, the rich donations, which, in former ages princes and nobles, the great and the small, used piously to pour into them. Now, few were the bequests to the church. Her priories, convents and religious establishments were falling into ruin, while many of those which remained were shorn of their domains. Few monasteries could maintain a full brotherhood of well-kept monks without parting piece-meal with the estates which gave them dignity and power. San Eliseo, the priory of father Eustaquio, was at one time one of the most powerful houses of the order of Benedictine monks. But it had gradually fallen until now it existed only nominally; father Eustaquio and four poor brothers of the order alone dwelling in it and saving it from total ruin and desecration. The prior did not cease daily to lament the poverty of his priory, and in his sermons which he from time to time preached from city to city, he did not fail to denounce with anathema those false sons of the church who died without making her bequests; but his efforts to build up San Eliseo were but illy-rewarded; for he returned to his priory seldom with a heavier saca than he went forth with. Father Eustaquio belonged also to one of the oldest families of Corsica, originally from Spain, and his pride of descent was not a little involved in his desire to preside over a religious establishment of wealth and influence. San Eliseo, it is true, afforded him a quiet abode and leisure for books, to which he was greatly attached, and in the study of which his time passed without interruption and in comparative quiet. Perhaps, but for the arrival of the galleon, his peace would never have been disturbed by any re-awakening of ecclesiastical ambition. The movements of the galleon, after she had hauled out of the inlet and anchored, up to the time of her departing at the close of the day, had been nervously watched by the prior. There was evidently, from his excited and restless manner some deep subject upon his thoughts. At length when he saw the galleon fling broad her canvass to the evening breeze and slowly and majestically stand off from the land, his dark gray eye lighted up with pleasure and satisfaction. He watched her as she steered northwardly doubling the promontory of La Nez and then tack to pass round the northern end of the island. He did not leave the window until the shades of night gathering over the sea rendered her finally invisible. `Heaven be thanked!' ejaculated the prior, as he turned from the window when he could no longer see her—`Heaven be thanked! She has gone and the saints keep her away henceforward!' `Amen!' fervently said a deep voice close at hand. The prior looked round with a frown and saw in the gloom of the chapel one of the monks standing by him. `What are you doing here, brother?' he demanded, sternly. `I came to remind your reverence that the vesper bell is still tolling.' `Ah, I had forgotten my duty. You did well to remind me. I was here watching the pirate's departure. You heard me pray, Anselmo, that she might never return?' `Yes, your reverence, and I again respond `Amen!' `Anselmo. There are some of the crew of the galleon saved! How many reached the shore?' `Seventeen common sailors.' `You gave them food and have provided lodging for them?' `Yes, your reverence.' `Tomorrow morning the lugger from Santa Ana, which I despatched the fisherman Piedro for, will be here to take them to Genoa, which is the nighest port where they will be likely to find a Spanish vessel. Have you assembled them in the chapel to return thanks for their escape from this pirate?' `They are there with the brethren, awaiting your presence!' `And this maiden?' inquired the prior in a lower tone and with a slight degree of confusion. `Does she still sleep?' `Mancha, the vine-dresser's wife, says she has not waked since noon!' `It is favorable. The medicine I administered after she revived from her swoon was a soothing narcotic. She is comfortably lodged?' `As well as she can be, your reverence, in such a place,' answered the monk. `I would gladly admit her into the monastery; but the rules of our order strictly forbid that a woman should cross its threshold!' `Yes, your reverence. I remember in Spain the queen desired to visit our monastery of San Pablo, and did so in spite of the remonstrances of the prior. But after she had left it, the door by which she had entered was walled up, and the pavement wherever her foot had trod was taken up and relaid!' `Anselmo!' `Your reverence!' `I can trust you?' `I am the servant of your reverence,' answered Anselmo, who was a short, fat, oily monk, with a cheerful aspect and an habitual look of awe towards his superior. `Not now! By and by! The vesper hour is passed and I must to the chancel!' The ensuing morning a small lugger, called by the Corsicans a `Lozana,' of about forty tons, latteen rigged, entered the inlet of El Gancho, and dropped anchor near the foot of the path leading up to the monastery. Already grouped upon the white beach were the Spanish sailors. The monks and father Eustaquio stood among them. `Now, my children, fare thee well,' said the prior, lifting up his hands.— `Kneel around me while I give thee my benediction!' The seamen knelt in a half circle around; the brethren of the order also kneeled behind their superior, and then in a firm, loud voice, the prior gave them his blessing. When they had risen to their feet he said— `Come hither each of you and kiss my hand, children. I have provided at my expense a safe and commodious vessel for you to depart in for Genoa, where you will doubtless find some ship of your own country. I wish you a prosperous voyage. With regard to the specie which has been entrusted to the convent,' added father Eustaquio, avoiding the eyes of the men, `I would enjoin upon you religious silence; lest hearing of its being here, some lawless freebooter may visit the island and carry it off by force before I can send word to his most Catholic Majesty that it is here, which I shall do the earliest convenience. Now depart, my children, with my blessing!' The seamen then, each in turn, reverently kissed the hand of the prior, and embarked for the Lozana in a small boat, which travelled thrice between it and the shore before it took them all on board. The little vessel then hoisted her triangular sails, and favored by a fair though a light wind moved out from the shore, and soon afterwards entered upon the open sea, steering her course towards the Tuscany coast. The monks re-ascended to their monastery; but the prior lingered on the terrace of rocks by the gate to watch the receding lugger with perhaps no less interest in her departure than he had felt in that of the galleon. He did not turn from the rock until he saw her like a spec upon the horizon. When he did so his face wore a peculiar expression of satisfaction. `They have gone too! The pirates first departed, as I believe, ignorant of the treasure conveyed here; and now the only witnesses of it have departed also! What guilty ambitious views are taking such strong hold upon my soul? What dark and daring thoughts have seized my senses? I fear to examine myself! I fear to know what I feel! I tremble to ask myself what I mean? This is a strange event that has occurred! A million and a half of gold and silver in bullion and coin in the vaults of the convent and those who deposited it here have perished! A portion, I was told by Don Ferdinand belonged to the crown, but a half a million in the boxes and hide-sacks, marked “F DE G.” were his own. Yes, he brought his own wealth on shore first! then as much of the king's as he could before the corsair came upon them! He is now dead! the king's captain is dead! the men who deposited it here are dead or departed! Shall I look upon this as an act of Providence for the good of the monastery! Shall not God rob kings for his church?' The ambitious prior walked up and down the terrace in deep thought! He had evidently yet formed no plan. That he had been assaulted by the temptation and given ear to it, to appropriate, if possible, the treasures in his vaults to enriching his monastery was evident! The temptation had taken hold upon him with the firm grasp of avarice. Yet how should he do this thing in safety! How could he appropriate the King of Spain's treasures! Their fate would sooner or later be known! Some of the seamen would reach Spain, and would necessarily mention it in describing the loss of the galleon. This difficulty seemed insurmountable. `No. I cannot take the king's money! That I must deliver up! It is clear that it will be claimed. Therefore to stand well with his majesty I will not delay sending him word. I will do it promptly by despatching a lugger! My promptness and zeal will doubtless be rewarded by the king. I shall at least gain something! This step shall be taken without delay!' The prior again renewed his thoughtful walk up and down the terrace.— A subject of deep and powerful interest was evidently agitating his mind. His brow contracted and grew dark. His lips were compressed with energy, or moving with muttered expressions. `The father has perished! She alone lives! She is in my power! The secret of his treasure may be kept! Ah! I have it! Heaven, I thank thee for the thought! It is mine! The treasure is the church's! Happy thought! At one stroke—at a single glance of the mind I have done it!' The shade cleared up from his brow! His head was elevated! His eye beamed with a smile of success, and his step became buoyant and firm!— An air of decision sat upon his features and took the place of his previous anxiety and agitation. He looked like a man who has determined upon an evil step and has boldness to pursue it. He lingered an instant to scrutinize the horizon in the direction which the lugger had taken, and then, instead of entering the gate of the monastery as he was first about to do, he passed rapidly around the walls to the south side of the vast pile, and approached a hamlet composed of half a dozen of vine-dressers and goat-herds huts, which were built on a sort of street under the walls. He directed his steps towards one of these abodes, shaded by a fig-tree, and sheltered by an angle of the southern tower It was a neat peasant's cottage with a thatched roof and a rude portico before the low entrance. As the prior approached the humble habitation his step faltered, and a few paces off he stopped to get perfect command of the expression of his countenance; then with a dignified religious air that became his noble figure, he entered the open door of the cot. `Benedicite, sister!' he said as a poor woman came from an inner apartment on hearing his step. `Good morning, your reverence,' she humbly answered, dropping on one knee and crossing herself. `You have come to see how the poor lady does.' `Yes, Mancha,' answered the prior gravely. `She is a daughter of the church in affliction and needs our care.' She is better, your reverence, this morning. Last night, after she had waked up and remembered all that had happened she wept for three hours mourning her father and then fell asleep. She seems more easy this morning and has eaten something. Will your reverence walk in and see her.— She is dressed, for I told her you would no doubt call to talk with her.' Father Eustaquio followed her into a low ceiled chamber, where seated in a cane chair, with her face leaning upon her hand sat the lovely orphan, her face pale with silent grief. On the entrance of the monk she lifted her large tearful eyes towards his face, and a slight color chased the pallor from her cheek. `You are kind, reverend father to visit me!' she said with a grace of manner of which that affliction could not rob her. `I am just able to realise the full extent of my misfortune! I fear to enquire—but has my father's body been found?' `It has not, sister. Several of the bodies have been heaved upon the beach, and will be interred to day with the services of the church. Search shall be made for that of Senor de Garcia!' `Thanks, your reverence,' she answered with grateful warmth. `I trust you are better, senora?' `I am less overcome than at first, I should feel more resigned to know that my father had Christian sepulture. It is fearful to think of his lying unburied beneath the sea!' `Every means shall be taken to recover his body, lady. In the meanwhile I would look to your comfort. You are aware that the rules of our order do not permit females to enter within the walls of our establishments.— Mancha! you may retire,' he said, turning to the woman. `Now that we are alone, senora, I will invite you to share the hospitalities of the monastery until you can obtain passage for Spain. The hut is not suitable for the accommodation of a person of your rank, and also it is unsafe for you to remain here; for there are ladrones upon the shore as well as upon the sea. There is one wing which has not been used for some time, and is not now by the order, which I will prepare for you. There you can remain secluded until a vessel arrives from Spain to remove the specie belonging to the crown. You shall be surrounded with every comfort and have a woman to wait upon you.' Dona Elena thanked the prior who seemed so kindly interested in her welfare and said, `I have no alternative but to intrude upon your hospitality, reverend father, until I can leave in a vessel for Spain. I possess as you know wealth. I pray you to hire for me from the adjoining port a vessel to transport me and my father's treasure to the nearest port of Spain!' `There is no vessel, lady, lying in that port which could safely make the voyage with your specie. I will, tomorrow, despatch one to inform the king of the treasure here in my possession, and also of your presence here. Doubtless before many days—a month at farthest—some vessel will be despatched hither to receive you and the bullion!' `Till then I will be your guest,' said Dona Elena. The Prior then took his leave. Towards evening of the same day the Castillian maiden, escorted by the prior and followed by Mancha, who was to be her attendant, entered the wing appropriated to her accommodation, until she should be able to leave the island. Here Dona Elena found every comfort suitable to her sex and condition, though without any luxuries. Books were at her command, and she had the privilege of walking upon the terrace over the corridor, which commanded a wide horizon. Here she would turn her gaze towards Spain, and pray for some friendly vessel to visit the island. In the meanwhile, the prior had despatched a small lugger to the nearest Spanish port, with a let ter, to be forwarded by a courier to the king. It was as follows: Dated at San Elisco, (Corsica) June 28, 1700. “Most-Noble and Powerful Catholic Prince, Emperor and Lord! It is my painful duty to communicate to your Highness, the loss, by capture, in our bay of El Gancho on the morning of the 25th instant, of Your Majesty's Galleon `La Reina Isabel.' This ship was driven into the Mediterranean by an adverse gale and afterwards prevented by a corsair from regaining her port, being chased until she run for shelter, three nights ago into our secluded bay. Here she was attacked and defended with great courage, so that she sunk the corsair's vessel, who boarded the Galleon in boats, and after a hard fight succeeded in capturing her. Among the slain were the captain with all his officers, and El Escelentissimo Senor Don Ferdinand de Garcia, who with his daughter were passengers. Previous to the attack, Don Ferdinand removed for safe keeping to our priory, one million of specie belonging to your majesty, which I hold in trust at your majesty's command. He left on board the galleon half a million which there was not time to remove, which fell into the hands of the corsair Kidd, who has possessed himself of the captured vessel and, after repairing her, sailed from the island in her, doubtless bent on further deeds of rapine. I further inform your highness that Don Ferdinand landed half a million in specie, belonging to himself, which I have also in the priory vaults. His daughter, who was fortunately landed before the attack is now here under our protection, and will take measures for the transportation to Spain of herself and of her father's wealth. Your most Sacred Majesty's very humble servant, who kisses the royal feet and hands yf your majesty. Eustaquio, Prior.” We now return to the galleon for the present, and follow new adventures. The fourth day after leaving the island she encountered a heavy tempest, which compelled her, after battling with it a night and a day to put into the Infidel port of Algiers for shelter. It so happened that at this time there existed between England and the Dey a good understanding, and the English ships, by paying a yearly tribute, were suffered to trade with the country without obstruction. The Dey had a high respect for the English nation, not only on account of their strength and valor, but for the riches their commerce poured into his lap. This state of feeling was well known to the corsair, who had made himself familiar with all the peculiarities appertaining to every part of the globe. Finding himself compelled by the storm to run into Algiers, he run up the English flag at the peak, resolved to assume the character of an English ship. He came boldly to anchor under the guns of the castle of the Dey, where he rode out the gale; and the next morning the storm having subsided, he went on shore to pay a visit to his his highness. The Dey received him in great state and with gorgeous displays of his magnificence and power. His Highness was seated upon a throne of ivory, at the upper extremity of a lofty Hall surrounded by mirrors. It was the great audience chamber. The floor was covered with Persian mats representing battle scenes; the most costly canopy of gold with hangings of tapestry surrounded the throne; the ceiling was adorned with exquisite paintings of flowers in gold and blue, and was supported by columns of beautiful verde antico. On the right of the throne a step lower than the seat oceupied by the Dey, was a burnished chair in which was seated the Sultan Mother; and on his left upon a pile of gorgeous carpets reclining upon a cushion covered with the soft gold feathers of the olange was the beautiful daughter of the Dey, the Princess Xerifa! Around her knelt a group of female slaves, and behind the throne stood a score of tall Moors, in green urbans and holding naked scimetars in their hands. On either side of the passage to the throne were lines of soldiers drawn up, and outside of the hall, in the paved court, were squadrons of gorgeous cavalry superbly armed and costumed. Through the midst of this imposing array of military power and regal magnificence, the corsair and Belfort passed to be presented to the Dey.— Both were richly attired and were in character with the scene of splendor. Knowing the customs of the country, Kidd knelt and kissed the ground at the feet of the Dey, and then rising bowed his head low to the Sultan Mother, while with his eyes as well as his person he did homage to the beautiful Princess. Belfort went through the same ceremony with equal self-possession; and as his glance noted the wonderful beauty of the Princess, he could scarcely suffer himself to withdraw it. `You are welcome noble captain of England,' said his Highness, graciously speaking in Spanish. `We hail your presence here in our port as a further seal of the good feeling which exists between our court and that of your king. But we in a special manner welcome you here; for we shall need your service and that of your ship!' `My ship and myself are both at the service of your Highness,' answered the corsair readily. `You shall not serve me without recompense, Sir Englishman! After you have been refreshed by the collation which awaits you, I will open to you the business for which I desire yeur service!' Thus speaking the Dey rose from his throne, and commanding them to follow him, retired into an inner apartment, where a sumptuous feast was spread for their entertainment.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER VI. The Prince of the Desert. The banquet given by the Dey Mahommed Ali, to the supposed English captain, was a scene magnificence. The colored light streaming through the painted windows; the sounds of invisible music, floating through the lofty hall; the gorgeous colours of the dresses of the guests; the hues of the carpets that covered the marble floor; the glowing tints of tapestry; the slender columns supporting the roof, wreathed with silver veins bearing flowers of pearls and rubies, all seemed like a creation of enchantment. The table was covered with dishes of gold, siver and crystal, and the air was perfumed with the sweetest fragrance from vases of burning incense. The Ethiopean slaves in crimson turbans, green jackets trimmed with gold, snow-white Turkish trowsers and scarlet slippers, were moving over the yielding carpets without noise, waiting upon the guests. In gilded cages hung above the pointed Morisco windows, were innumerable singing birds whose warbling mingled with the unseen music floated through the room. Cushions of gorgeous crimson satin or velvet, embroidered with flowers or stars of gold and silver, were placed for each person; and beside their dishes were napkins of the whitest Abysinian wool, embroidered with silver and fringed with richly coloured threads. As the feast commenced, a slave placed before each guest a vase of rose-water in which to lave his fingers, for no forks or knives were used at this repast. The Dey was seated at the head of the board, with the corsair upon his right hand and the embassador of the Bashaw of Tunis on his left. Next to the corsair sat Belfort. The other guests to the number of thirty, consisted of the officers of the Dey's court and army. No females were present; the ladies having retired to their own apartments on leaving the hall of audience. The Dey having elevated his hands and cried aloud, `Alla is great,' the slaves proceeded to serve the banquet. There were exquisite dishes made of flour, honey and oil; kaimac, a delicious preperation of cream thickened with almondes; moalibe, a transparent jelly eaten with powdered sugar and rose-water; and keboabs, without which no Moslem meal is perfect. There were also spiced dishes of meats rolled in vine leaves; and dolmas a preparation of plums and cream made into cakes and eaten with honey and spices. There were also the more substantial dishes of dried beef, fowls, lamb and soups of exquisite flavors, with numerous other oriental dishes, not omitting the pilauf, coloured scarlet with tomato juice and flavored with nightingales. Then came grapes and figs, pomegranates and golden melons. The meal proceeded in grave silence as became the dignity of Eastern manners. Fragrant coffee and cool sherbets 3 followed the more substantial repast, and while these were being drunk, pipes were brought in studded with diamonds and adorned with chains of silver, and presented to each guest, with vases of rose water to bathe their hands. While they were smoking a troop of beautiful daneing girls entered and began to perform before them the graceful and voluptuous dances of the East. `Taib! taib! good! good!' cried the Dey, as two of the most beautiful of the dancers ended a very difficult and elegant shawl-dance. `By the beard of the prophet you shall be rewarded!' and he cast towards them a chain of pearls, which broke at their feet scattering the jewels over the crimson carpet. `What think you of the dances of our court, sir Englishman?' `They excel those of all lands I have ever visited, most noble Effendi,' answered the Corsair. `Those two slaves are a present from my brother the Pacha of Tunis. Tuleiman,' he cried addressing the Tunisian Embassador; `I am well pleased with thy gift. I would have thee tell his excellency, the Pacha thy master, I am content with his present. Mashallah! they please me!' And the Dey, who was a noble looking man, with a magnificent brown beard, stroked his beard and looked contented. `Almad my master,' answered the embassador gravely stroking his own black beard in his turn, `shall be told what my ears have heard. He will be content!' And having spoken, he majestically bowed his turbaned head to the earth before the Dey and then resumed his silver tubed pipe. `Chok chai! you have spoken well!' answered the Dey. `What sayest thou, Frangist,' he said turning to the crosair; `would thy king accept from me these young Zibales?' `My king would not refuse a gift from your Highness. But in his court each courtier dances for himself!' `Mash-allah! that is wonderful!' ejaculated the Dey. He then smoked a few minutes is silence, and giving a signal with a gentle wave of his hand, the guests all rose and began to retire. `Follow me, Frangist Effendi,' said the Dey addressing the corsair and turning towards a door which his slaves had thrown open on one side of the banquet hall. `Follow me and alse the young Aga thy friend with thee. I have business to talk of with thee before my Divan!' The pirate followed the Dey into a saloon less in size than the banquet hall, but adorned with greater elegance and splendor. On three sides were ranged daii covered with pink silk, sprinkled with silver stars. The fourth side was open to the air and looking into a beautiful court or garden in which was a fountain. The white buildings of the city and the slender minerets of the mosques were seen above the rich foliage, and beyond was visible the blue sea, with the fortresses at the entrance of the harbor, and the corsair's galleon riding at anchor with the English colors flying at her main. Curtains and tapestry adorned three side of the saloon, on which were represented combats of horsemen upon the desert and battles between the Algerine caiques and the ships of Frangistan or Christendom. Mohammed Ali seated himself upon the central and most elevated dais beneath a canopy. By his direction the two strangers were seated near him upon gorgeous carpets placed for the purpose. On the left sat the stately Tunisian embassador, and on the right were the three officers of the Deywho constituted his Divan or cabinet. The pipes of these several personages having then replenished and vases of rose water, with goblets of iced sherbet placed on little silver trays before each one by slaves who then retired.— The Dey then opened the business he had with the crosair, preparatory to entering upon which he had thus magnificently entertained him. `Know, noble captain Effendi of Frangistan that I have a fair daughter the light of my eyes, the flower of my heart! She is called Xerifa, or the lotus-blossom; and as thou hast seen her unveiled with thine eyes, I need not speak of her beauty to thee. The Pacha of Tunis, my friend, having heard of the beauty of Xerifa has sent to me to ask her hand in marriage. Ne-bilirim? what should I say to his request? He is my friend. He is powerful and rich. We have been at war and are now at peace. He wishes by these nuptials to seal our friendship.' Here the Dey was silent and began to smoke his chibouque with some energy. `What reply gave your Highness to this request of the Pacha?' asked the corsair. `What shall I say to my lord's question? Mashallah! I bade my daughter prepare to accompany the embassador to Tunis and be the bride of the mighty Almad Pacha of Tunis. El bilirim! what could I say more!' `And the lovely Xerifa gave her consent?' asked the corsair. `We ask not the full blown flower if we shall pluck it! I asked her not. She obeys when I command!' `When does she accompany the embassador?' asked the corsair, who had already in imagination captured the Tunisian bark. `That is what I would speak of,' said the Dey with more decision in his manner. `Three weeks ago the embassador reached my court in a fair ship for the purpose of conveying back my daughter to Tunis. Unfortunately the vessel took fire five nights ago and burned to the water's edge. I have no suitable vessel in my port, all my captains being at sea prosecuting my war against the Emperor of Morocco. Your ship has arrived in port therefore at a time when you can serve me with profit to myself, as well as strengthening the friendly interests that exist between me and your royal master of the Island, whose friendship I feel proud to cultivate; he having paid me always the yearly tribute I enjoined upon him, of one armed ship and one hundred packages of cloth.' Having thus spoken, the Dey struck two of his fingers sharply into his palm making a ringing sound, when his chibouque-bearer entered, and kneeling before him, received from his hand his costly pipe of rose-wood wreathed with silver and tipped with amber. At the same time his cafeghee appeared bearing upon a silver waiter minute cups of porcelain filled with fragrant mocha. These were handed to each one present, after first presenting an elegant fillagree stand upon which to hold the cup. `Noble and Mighty Effendi,' said the corsair, after the slaves had retired, `if I can serve you I and my ship at your command!' `Taib! good! You shall have for taking my daughter and her bridal treasure to Tunis—the voyage is short—a thousand golden sequins and the two dancing slaves, the Pacha has sent me. You have seen them with your own eyes!' Are you content?' `I am content, Effendi,' answered the corsair, concealing his satisfaction under a countenance of great composure. Belfort raised his eyes and rested them upon the face of the pirate with an expression of dissatisfaction and dlspleasure. `Bring hither the Zibales and let the Frangist behold them again and take them away with him!' he said, calling a slave. In a few moments the two dancers entered, not in their former gossamer costume, but veiled. `Unveil!' commanded the Dey as they stood before him. They obeyed. Thep were girls of not more than seventeen years of age, with `gorgeous Georgian figures,' superb and voluptuous, with eyes large and expressive, deep-souled and flashing, and with dark hair flowing to their feet. The corsair, though little given to passion for the sex, could not view them without admiration. Belfort surveyed them with compassion, for he knew and deeply felt how degraded was the destiny to which they were doomed, whether as the dancers of the seraglio or the slaves of the pirate. `What would you do with these poor almes* * Dancing Girls. ?' asked Belfort aside. `Let them remain, and if you are wise, refuse to give your ship to this use. I have your promise that if I sailed with you, you would seek the West Indies or the American coast. Let us at once seil thither!' `The promise of Kidd is sacred,' said the pirate haughtily though not unkindly. `I will take this Princess to Tunis, and then my lord Belfort, I will sail with you whither you will! A thousand sequins in gold is not money to be thrown away! I accept these slaves for his Highness to dispose of at Gibraltar to some of the young Hidalgos!' added the corsair with a smile. `Harems I am told are becoming quite the mode among the Castillian nobles. These beautiful Zibales will bring me a thousand pesos. I look at these things, you see, with a merchant's eye, my good lord!' Belfort made no remark; and as the Dey seemed to regard mistrustfully the conversation in language which he did not understand, Belfort said, `Your Highness, is this Pacha of Tunis young and of good person that your daughter, the princess, will not repent her submission to your commands?' `Bashasta! he has forty-five years over his head and hath a sear across his cheek. He never need look into a mirror! Praise be to Allah, she is as good as she is fair, Frangist,' answered the Dey, sipping his fragrant coffee.' Are the Frangi woman lovely, Effendi!' `They are very fair and are intelligent companions!' `Companions? Alhemdulillah! Allah be praised! We have not such sensible women in Algiers! Your women too walk in the public places with their faces bare and speak with other men than their husbands, and eat at the same table with them! Ajaib chai! It is a wonder!' `Haif! haif! Shame, sname!' repeated the Dey's ministers looking scandalised. `On my soul be it! I would have the head of a woman that would appear in the streets of my city with her face naked!' said the Dey with great positiveness. It was settled before the Divan broke up that the Princess Xerifa should the next day embark on board the galleon for Tunis in company with the embassador who had come for her and with two atteudants, besides a very large amount of jewels and gold as her bridal treasures. The corsair and his lieutenant then departed for their ship, the Dey placing upon the hand of Belfort a superb diamond in token of his friendship, and throwing around the neck of the pirate a necklace of rubies. You look upon me with ill-looks, Belfort,' said Kidd, after they had pulled a few moments silently towards their vessel. `I love you and can put up with some moodiness and wayward conduct; but by the mass! if I have offended you I would like you to tell me of it.' `I have no control over yon, I well know,' answered Belfort. `But I wish to express my disapprobation of this affair you are about entering upon! It is not your intention that the princess shall aver see Tunis. Your love of gold is excited by her treasures and you covet their possession!' `Well?' repeated the corsair as if he waited for him to proceed. `I will not join in any treachery which brings ruin upon this lovely princess!' This was spoken firmly. The massive brow of the corsair darkened as a mountain precipice darkens under the shadow of a passing cloud. He drew his embroidered glove on and off several times in rapid succession, bit his lip and let the fire flash and sparkle in his dark angry eyes. But the storm passed. His face become composed and a smile took the place of the frown. `You are young and chivalrous, Belfort. Your three years on shore have changed you. I see you are less yourself every day. But I have a sincere regard for you. You have more than once saved my life in former days and often gave me good council. I would gladly oblige you by refusing to take the princess. But my word is pledged to the Dey. I could not refuse. If he suspected I was other than I assume to be—if he discovered my true character, these enormous, gaping sixty pounders, under the muzzles of which I am anchored, would blow us into the air. The Dey allows no corsairing but what is done by his own ships!' `But you pledged yourself to me when I came on board of your brig at Gibraltar, that if I proceeded with you in chase of the Galleon you would then cruise in the West Indies!' `So I did. But we were forced in here by a storm. The trip to Tunis will occupy but a week, and then I am at your service. I cannot get off from my engagement with the Bashaw without arousing his suspicions and displeasure, He may detain me and try to compel me, which might lead to a discovery; as I am here completely in his power!' `Will you promise not to harm the princess?' The pirate was silent a moment, and then replied frankly, and with a smile,—`I give you my promise. But why do you particularly desire me to keep steadily on towards the West Indies? The whole sea is ours! If we gain wealth here why not remain awhile?' `I have a desire to visit Jamaica. We were there once you emember. I have friends there!' `Ah, some inamorata you would see again! Well I will indulge you. In this affair of the princess I must be indulged also.' He spoke with a determination of tone that showed Belfort he could not safely urge the matter further; and in a few moments afterwards they reached the galleon. The day drew to a close, and the low-breathing sea breezes of a fair summer's evening were stirring the tops of the palms and just rippling the waters of the bay. In an apartment opening into the gardens of the harem of the Dey's palace sat the gentle Xerifa. Tears stood in her deep eyes and sighs at intervals stole from her bosom. There was a luxurious beauty in the hour and the scene around her, but her pulse throbbed not to its influence. Before her, like an emerald lake, waved the surface of a deep grove, and gardens descended terrace below terrace to the sea. Birds gorgeously winged, with breasts of gold and purple, sported in the branches of the trees, and from fountains of the purest marble shot upward silvery jets brightly into the sunlight, to fall back in a continual shower upon water-loving blossoms that crept over the basin. The fragrant breath of a thousand flowers filled the odorous air, and around her, suspended in prisons of exquisite workmanship, were bul-buls and Arabian nightingales, whose ceaseless songs made the groves and saloons ring with melody. But the betrothed princess was insensible to all this enchantment. Her open palm was laid upon her fair brow in sad thought. Upon a cushion not far from her, knelt one of the Georgian almes, whom the Dey had presented to the corsair, and which the latter on leaving him had desired should remain in attendance on the princess. Her hands were crossed upon her bosom, and her eyes were full of gentle sympathy. `I grieve to see you so sad, Effenda—my beautiful mistress,' said the slave in a voice that was music. `You have cast aside your jeweled taslec, and your costly mirror is neglected. Your bracelets are unclasped and fallen at your feet, and you have crushed the flowers I gathered for you without knowing that you received them. Can I do any thing, lady, to soothe your grief? I am thine—my heart is thine! Shall I sing or shall I tell thee a story of love!' The princess raised her dark tearful eyes, and fixed them on her for a moment with a half-uneonscious look; then surveying her face with interest, she said,—`Come hither, fair Georgian! Your words are gentle, and they have touched a chord in my soul. What is thy name?' `Ilda!' `You have not been my attendant before. Where is thy sister?' `She sleeps. She is fatigued. She is also sad, for she would serve you, and fears her Frangist lord!' `And do you not fear him, Ilda?' `No Effenda,' answered the beautiful slave with sparkling eyes. `I fear nothing. If danger comes it is but a moment's flight to paradise!' `Wonld you take your life, Georgian?' `If I was unhappy!' answered the alme flrmly. `I can never be unhappy, for I feel that I can in an instant be happy! So I let nothing trouble me, Effenda!' `But death is fearful!' `It is not so tearful as fear!' `I am unhappy, Ilda, yet I would not die!' `You are not a slave, Effenda. Slaves may die when they will! Why is my noble mistress unhappy?' asked the Georgian with interest. `Can I trust you, Ilda?' `Nay, if a princess, who is commanded to marry a husband she has not seen, is unhappy on the eve of her bridal, the secret is not difficult to guess,' said she, archly. `You are a daughter of the Eblis for divining,' said the princess with a smile. `I will confide in you, Ilda,' said Xerifa in a low tone, after looking cautiously around. `I will be true my noble lady!' answered the beautiful Georgian, looking up from her cushion with attentive and faithful eyes. `Know then, Ilda, that my heart is another's. The noble and youthful Prince of the Desert, Haroun-Almad has won my heart. I have met him but thrice. The first time was last spring, when I was journeying in the caravan from this city to Haroum. We were attacked by a party of mounted Saharicks, and our escort cut to pieces. The robbers penetrated to the centre of the caravan, and the horse upon which I was mounted was seized by their chief, and I was borne like the wind a captive toward the mountains. It was some minutes in the melee before my father knew that I was absent, when he gathered as many of his dispersed soldiers together as he could and pursued. My captor and his party had nearly reached the mountains, when a party of richly attired horsemen, led by a youth of noble presence, crossing the plain, challenged the robbers to stand. A severe battle took place, the Saharicks were defeated, and I was rescued by the victorious young chief in person. When he learned what had occurred, and that I was the daughter of the Dey, he at once escorted me back, and meeting with my father surrendered me to him without ransom!' `He was indeed a noble youth,' said the Georgian, who very properly looked upon this generosity as a peculiar evidence of Oriental magnanimity. `From that time I never ceased to think of him for a day; nor did he of me, as he afterwards told me.' `Then you saw him afterwards!' exclaimed Ilda. `Yes,' answered the princess, blushing. `A month afterwards, he visited the court and solicited my band in marriage!' `Oh that was so charming and good in him!' `But my father would not consent, because the prince ruled over only desert tribes, and had no large sea-port cities and navies. He called him a Bedouin Robber, and bade him leave his court. He, however, found an opportunity to see me, for somehow or other he knew that he was not indifferent to me; and he tried to urge me to fly to the desert with him and be his bride. I believe I should have conseuted, had not our interview been discovered, and he himself taken and bound by a party of the Turkooman palace guard; we having been betrayed by the slave that we trusted.' `A scimetar should have taken off her head,' said the Georgian with flashing eyes. `He was a eunuch. The prince slew him upon the spot for his treachery. That night a party of the prince's horsemen entered the city, attacked the prison and rescued him.' `And did you see him a third time?' `Only the night before this hateful Tunisian ambassador's arrival! It was in this very garden! He was disguised as an Ethiopian slave! He then told me that he would come for me on the eve of the Reza, when my father would be at the mosque with all the retinue of the palace. He would come with two fleet horses for himself and me, and a thousand of his warriors would ride into the city with him and surround the palace till I had mounted, when they would escort me in safety to the desert!' `How full of romance!' exclaimed the Georgian; `and the Eve of Reza is three days from this, and tomorrow you must be given up to the Tunisian embassador for his master. And old and ill-visaged he is, my princess! Alas! that the Prince of the Desert were not here tonight!' `Alas, indeed,' sighed Xerifa. `I have tried to find a way of conveying news to him of my situation, but there is not one in the palace I can trust.' And tears filled her eyes. The slave looked very thoughtful a moment. `It is too late now,' she said, shaking her head sadly. At this moment both were startled by the appearance of a person coming from behind a covert of a pomegranate tree that grew so near as to reach its scarlet fruit into the saloon.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER VII. The Captive. This person was a young man of fair skin and blue eyes, and wore the costume peculiar to the white slaves, captured from christian vessels which the Dey at that time held in bondage. It was a close-fitted scarlet cap, and a coarse green jacket with blue cotton trowsers. A chain extended between his left ancle and wrist with sufficient play to enable him to perform labor. This person had been captured in a French ship, though his native land was the British Colony of Massachusetts. He had been in bondage for more than a year and being taken in a vessel of France had been treated as one of that country; for the Dey then held no Englishman in bondage. The young American was employed as a gardner in the palace garden, and from his patient and faithful performance of his task had been recently promoted to be a sort of overseer of the other slaves in the garden. The arrival of the English ship, as he supposed it to be, inspired him with the idea of escape; and he tried ineffectually to make known his bondage to Belfort or the corsair, but he could not attract their attention; and he had too often witnessed the free use of the Dey's scimeter on the necks of his fellows to risk discovery of his wishes by too much boldness. After the departure of the officers to their vessel, he watched it with eager eyes; and as he pursued his work in the garden in sight of it, he busied his thoughts upon some plan of escape. But the walls were high, and guards were stationed on the outside, and instant death he felt would be his portion if his attempt proved unsuccessful. At length as he was pruning a pomegranite tree near the saloon in which the princess was wont to sit at twilight, a eunuch entered, and, according to custom called in a loud voice upon all the slaves to retire from the garden into the Sultan's grounds as the princess was about to make her appearance. The tree he was pruning concealed him from the eunuch as he passed; but he was about to follow him and obey, when an idea suddenly flashed upon his mind, that, as the eunuch had not seen him he might remain where he was concealed until night and then take advantage of the darkness to pass through the saloon when the princess should retire from it and so along the private galleries of the harem, to a terrace from which he knew he could let himself down into an ohscure street that ran beneath the wall. He therefore crouched closer under the dark foliage of the pomegranate-tree, while the eunnch having driven forth the other prisoners, locked the gates and repassed him with the keys without suspecting his presence. The young American was well aware that discovery would be the signal for his instant execution; but liberty was sweet enough to risk life to gain it; and although he did not know but that each moment he might be missed and searched for, he still resolved to keep hid, though as the princess had not yet come in, he might still have called to the eunuch and been let forth in safety. In a few moments the princess Xerifa attended by the beautiful alme Ilda entered the saloon of the Golden-cages, as it was called, and then passed into the gardens to walk. He saw that her countenance was sad; and his heart sympathised with sorrows of which he knew not the cause; for she had always been kind towards him and often sent him, by a slave, iced sherbet when she saw him working in the heat of the day. After she had walked a few minutes in the gardens she retired to the dais of the open saloon where we have seen her seated relating her story of love to the listening Georgian. The young American was so situated in his covert that he did not fail to hear every word that she uttered, for the language of the Moors had become familiar to his ear. He became deeply interested in her fate, and wished in his heart that it was in his power to aid her. If he had been free and could have mounted a fleet horse he would not have hesitated to have spurred to the desert with the intelligence she wished could reach the youthful prince. He wished more than ever that he was free, in order that he might save her. But he was a slave in chains, and each moment in peril of his head. `At any rate I can assure the princess of my sympathy and desire to serve her, and perhaps she may aid in my escape!' he said to himself. `If I can show myself without creating alarm, I will tell her I will serve her all in my power!' With this determination he waited for a favorable moment and, after first rustling the leaves of the pomegranate and then throwing a blossom upon the floor of the soloon, he emerged himself from his concealment full in sight, and not seven feet distant from them. The princess was about to fly, when throwing himself upon his kness where he stood, he made an impressive and eloquent gesture to detain her. `Stay noble princess!' he cried earnestly, `do not give the alarm! I am your friend! I have heard the story of your love and would serve you! Trust in me and I swear by your Allah I will not betray you!' Xerifa heard and arrested her flight, at the same time instinctively placing her hand upon the mouth of the Georgian, who was about to cry out for assistance. The princess had at once recognized the young gardener, and his words awakened she knew not what hopes in her bosom. `Fly, rash Frangist! what do you here? would you perish by the sabres of the eunuchs?' `I regard not life, lady, if I may aid you in your distresses. I have listened to your story and feel for you. But I am a slave. These chains render me incapable of serving you. Assist me in gaining my liberty, and the first fruits of that liberty I will consecrate to you and your cause!' `Hda,' said the princess in a low, earnest tone, and with a glowing cheek; `secure the door well, that no one may enter. Speak softly, christian! I have heard thee. I have a regard for thee. I believe thou art kind and generous and brave! Why hast thou lingered here? you will perish!' `I remained hid when the eunuch entered, in the hope of regaining my liberty by leaving the gardens in the darkness of the night, and so escape to the English ship. It was while thus concealed I overheard unwittingly your story. I at once resolved to make known my presence to you, noble princess, and offer my services in return for my liberty!' The princess listened with attention. The ingenuous face of the young man, bore testimony of his sincerity. She was silent and thoughtful. `Trust him, sweet mistress,' said the Georgian. `I know he will not deceive you.' `But how can we aid thy escape, noble christian youth?' she asked. `By leaving the outer doors of the harem open.' `And how will your freedom aid me or free me from the fate which awaits me on the morrow? How can you rescue me from the bonds of the Dey of Tunis? It is too late for you with the fleetest horse, to reach the desert which is a hundred leagues to the Southward, to call the Prince to my rescue.' `True lady, but there is a way to save you from the destiny that you dread, which has occurred to me. Englishmen are gallant and humane. If I could see this English captain, and make known to him your story, he would not hesitate to land you between this and Tunis, where you coul reach your lover! Nay, once free I could find a trusty messenger—a faith ful Moor whose life I saved, who would at once take horse and gallop to the desert without drawing rein, and inform the Prince at what point on the coast he would receive you from the English ship.' `I have no faith in this English captain,' said the Georgian. `If the younger Frangist were the captain, then could the princess trust him.' `I can but try, your Highness,' answered the young man. `I will trust you,' replied the princess. `I will aid you in your escape. `You will then do all you can to serve me?' `I will give my life, even, to your cause,' he answered firmly. `Remain in your concealment until after dark. Ilda will then bring you a disguise which will enable you to pass, if seen in your way out, as one of the soldiers of the palace. You will find the door of the Eastern corridor unfastened. Allah be with you, generous Frangist, and grant you success!' added the princess taking leave of him. About an hour after dark the Georgian stealthily entered the saloon, and placing a large hundle on the ground near the pomegranate, tree hastily retired without a word. The young American habited himself in the costume which was that of a Turkooman soldier! with a file contained in the package, he freed himself from his chains and then softly crossed the saloon to the door which he found ajar. After carefully looking around, and seeing and hearing no one, he passed into the corridor of the harem—a part of the palace in which to have been discovered would have been death even to one of the soldiers. At the extremity of this passage in which burned a solitary silver lamp, fed with aromatic oil, was a sort of rotunda called the Court of Mirrors. It was of an octagonal shape with a star of mirrors imbedded in each pannel, and the whole lighted from an invisible source; but from the myriad reflections of this single light, the place was as light as if the morning sun shone into it. This was the anti-room of the harem, and the common drawing room of the wives of the Dey. It was necessary to cross this lighted rotunda to gain the passage which led toward the outer wall of the palace. As this place was in the very heart of the harem the young prisoner's situation was one of eminent peril; and each step would increase it until he had passed the whole range of the apartments of the seraglio. Taking courage he crossed rapidly this lighted space, and sought the door leading to the passage on the opposite side. But as the doors were all alike and very numerous, in his confusion he did not take the right one, but entered instead of the gallery, a chamber softly lighted by silver urns of burning aroma. To his surprise he found that he was in one of the luxurious sleeping apartments of the seraglio. Upon couches of silk, reclined three or four lovely Circassian slaves. A glance showed him that they were in deep sleep. They hand soft olive complexions and very long black eye-lashes, with dark long hair flowing over their snowy arms and ivory shoulders. Their dresses were rich in material, yet simple as became the costume for night. Around the apartment were strewn robes of the most magnificent description beyond all that can be imagined. Jewels lay about the apartment in profusion. The raven tresses of one were powdered with gold dust, among which were negligently strewn inumerable small diamonds, as if carelessly scattered upon her flowing locks. She wore a jacket of the richest azure velvet and trowsers of the finest muslin. Her costume was that of the day-time, and from her appearance and attitude she seemed to have fallen asleep reading a Persian tale, which lay upon the carpet against one of her jewel-be-spangled feet. Filled with apprehensions for his safety, the young prisoner hastily retreated and approached another door which was ajar. He hesitated. But to linger was to undergo a greater risk than to advance. He threw it softly open and entered a broad paved passage. In it upon the pavement, wrapped in their green kaftanji, lay reposing several sentinels, their sabres by their side, while beyond he saw the gates which led from the Dey's gardens into the harem. He cautiously retreated from this dangerous passage without having disturbed the black guardians of the harem, and with his heart in his mouth paused on the ouside, after noiselessly turning the key upon them, to deliberate what to do. He had never been in the harem before, but he had heard it described by the slaves, and he had even once seen and carefully studied a plan of the palace and seraglio which he had once seen in the hall of audience. He therefore knew the direction of the passage into which he had intruded. He now surveyed the remaining doors and well considered their situation in reference to the other parts of the palace, and at length concluded to advance to one which he believed must lead in the direction he desired to go; for as there were many doors, one to each of the eight sides of the rotunda, and all precisely alike, it was no easy matter to judge correctly between them. The door he next ventured to open led into the corridor from which came a cool wind, by which he was assured he was right. He closed it after him and traversed the corridor until he came to a large quadrangle or court-yard surrounded by towers and high walls. On one side were green-houses filled with plants and on the opposite side was an immense number of cages containing birds; this being the aviary of the palace. At the end of the court he came to a heavy, gloomy gateway which led into the Dey's stables. Upon the ground beneath the arch lay several slaves fast asleep. He passed on without disturbing them, at each step in danger of his life, and leaving the gates on his left hand, he entered a side passage, vaulted and paved with rough marble. At the farther end he came to a gilded iron gate which he found unlocked with the massive key in the wards; and he knew by this that the princess had been before him to open his way according to her promise. The gate led upon a terrace which by steps descended into a lower garden ornrmented by parterres of flowers, the walls of which were covered with vines. He was now out of the palace. The stars shone down upon him, and the sea breezes fanned his brow. Before him was the harbor and the sea, but too indistinct to enable him distinguish objects. He had still danger to encoueter; for a wall was to be passed before he could gain the exterior of the seraglio grounds. He rapidly descended the marble flight leading from the terrace into the parterres, and then followed a walk to its extremity where was a summer house in the shape of a miniature kiosk. He entered this with caution. A black eunuch was sleeping upon the carpets within, and under his head was a sabre. He saw that it was necessary to step over him, to reach a little wicket in the back side, which would let him out of the range of the seraglio grounds, and which the princess had promised to have unlocked. The ennuch was the keeper of this private postern. The young American paused a moment. There was no time for long deliberation. The slave would no doubt be waked by the opening of the door, when discovery would lead to arrest. He bent over the Ethiopean and suddenly seized his sabre from beneath his head and placed a hand upon his throat. `Speak and you are the next instant slain!' he said to him; `come with me!' The slave rose to his feet and suffered the soldier as he supposed him to be, to lead him forth from the gate. The young man then locked it on the outside and taking the key into his possession, he bound and left the eunuch on the ground, and the next moment was flying down the steep street which led from the rear of the Dey's palace towards the waterside. He reached it in safety, for at that hour none were abroad. The galleon lay at anchor not a quarter of a mile from the quay. Avoiding the guard stationed on this spot, he followed the shore a little distance, until he found a fisher's bazal and jumping into it he shot out from the land towards the ship, and favored by the darkness reached the galleon unseen from the shore. Belfort was leaning over the quarter smoking a cigar, he having taken the watch, and thinking upon some plan to prevent mischief happening to the princess without bringing suspicion upon himself and his purposes, when he discovered a small boat containing a single person close under the counter of the vessel. Knowing a few words of the Algerine tongue, he challenged it, when he was answered in English, greatly to his surprise, `I am an English Subject escaped from bondage among the Infidels. I pray you receive me on board!' `As gladly as you will be to get on board,' answered Belfort in a cheerful, prompt tone. `Pull along side.' The young American the next moment stood upon the galleon's deck, and was received by Belfort with a warm grasp of the hand. `Welcome from captivity! I thought the Dey held no Englishman in bondage.' `I am a colonist under the crown, belonging to Boston; and being wrecked at sea was taken off the wreck by a French ship which was captured by an Algerine corsair; and ever since I have been in bondage with these Infidels!' `How have you succeeded in making your escape?' `By the aid of the lovely princess Xerifa!' `The same who is to take passage in the ship to-morrow for Tunis?' `The same. I was a gardener in the Dey's palace, and to-night, overhearing her lament that she was destined to become the bride of the Dey of Tunis, when her heart was another's, I offered, if she would aid me in escaping from the palace, to endeavor to enlist you, as Englishmen, in her fate, and to prevail upon you to prevent this proposed union which is so hateful to her and to befriend her in that which her heart desires.' `You have already deeply interested me in her fate! I noted her sadness when I was at the palace. Who is her heart's choice?' `The brave Haroun Almad, the Prince of the Desert. He is a ruler over thirty tribes, and can bring into the field thirty thousand horsemen. He is young, handsome and brave, and is devoted to her. He has openly asked her hand in marriage of the Dey; but he haughtily refused his consent. The prince has had one or two secret interviews with the princess, and at the last which took place on the evening before the arrival of the Tunisian Embassador, it was planned that on the eve of the solemn Fast of Reza, which is four days hence, when the Dey and all his court would be assembled in the mosque, he would enter the city at the head of his horse and carry her off. She now mourns her sad destiny, in being given to the Dey of Tunis before this time comes, and without the means of sending news of her fate to her lover!' `Then if this be true, by Saint Paul! she shall not be taken to Tunis in this ship,' said Belfort warmly. `We will delay our departure till news can reach this prince!' `Nay, good Belfort,' said the corsair coming up, for his quick ear had detected the sound of the boat alongside, and he had unseen come on deck, and heard all that passed; `nay, delay would endanger us, if by chance any English ship of war comes into port. I have heard of this Prince of the Desert, Haroun Almad. His territories lie a hundred leagues to the south of this, and approach within twenty of the sea-shore as we progress toward Tunis. Let the princess and her treasure come on board; this is my determination! then let a messenger be despatched to the prince to come down to the coast, near the deserted Port of Trabac, where I will land the princess and deliver her into his arms. From thence, good my lord, I will proceed whither you will.' This was spoken cheerfully and with a frankness of demeanor that deceived his lieutenant. `Can we find a messenger?' asked Belfort, doubtfully. `There is on shore, captain, a moor, Ali Hammel, honest and faithful to his trusts, whose life I once saved. I will return on shore and seek him out, and give him such directions as you may suggest,' `You may be arrested again,' said Belfort. `The dwelling of Ali is near the sea-shore, and secluded.' `Then go,' said the corsair. `If you are retaken I will demand your release tomorrow of the Dey.' After some further conversation, Owen Loring, as the young man gave his name, left the galleon, as he had come on board, without suspecting her true character. He bore with him orders to Ali Hammel to take horse at once for the Desert, and instruct the Prince Haroun to meet the ship, containing the princess at the Port of Trabac with such retinue as he saw fit. `You have my thanks, captain,' said Belfort. `I have judged you wrongfully in suspecting your motives in taking the princess as passenger. I confess to you my repugnance to lawless deeds of blood. I have not forgotten the pitiful end of the son of the Great Mogul, whom you took passenger and murdered to possess his treasure!' `Do you suppose I could murder the princess for her treasure?' asked the corsair with a smile. `Oh no, my lord, I am getting of your merciful humor. If you sail much longer with me I shall have to carry a chaplain!' `You are pleased to be ironical. I repeat that I am willing to cruise with you if you will cruise in the West Indies (if so you refuse to cruise nearer England) provided you let mercy reign while I am with you. You can increase your diamonds without first dipping them in human blood!' The pirate looked a moment dark and angry, and seemed as if he would have replied in a terrible tone; but he smiled grimly, and only remarked, `You seem to have rejoined me, Belfort, to convert me! I can't see what other motive you have in view! Well; do not try my patience and love for you too far!' In less than an hour the American returned in safety, reporting that he had despatched Ali to the Prince Almed on a fleet steed of the Desert.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER VIII. The Embarkation. The morning following these events was ushered in by the roar of the cannon upon the battery of the Dey's castle, in honor of the day of the bridal embarkation of the princess. The salutes were returned by the corsair's gaffeon; and under clouds of smoke that overhung the harbor, and amid the ceaseless discharges of artillery, the Dey left the mole in a gilded caique, pulled by twenty four slaves dressed in green and gold. Beneath a canopy of crimson satin reclined the Dey, and near sat the princess, with her slaves kneeling at her feet. She heeded nothing around her. Her countenance was sad and eloquently full of the deep sorrow which weighed upon her heart. She felt that her doom was sealed forever; and that there was no refuge for her but in death! The two lonely Georgians were her attendants. Ilda's face expressed all the sympathy of her faithful heart for her noble mistress. The Dey sat upon his cushioned dais in the stern of the caique, smoking his chebouque in calm and dignified repose, wholly indifferent to his daughter's sorrow. He had spoken and she must obey. Upon the deck of the galleon, which was adorned with flags, stood the corsair, magnificently attired as an English officer of rank. His chapeau, his bosom, his fingers, blazed with diamonds and precious stones, so that the Dey, on beholding him, turned to his vizier, who was in the boat with him, and striking his majestic beard, exclaimed—`Ajaib! wonderful!' `Mashallah! there is but one Allah! responded the vizier, gravely; and they saw in each other's eyes an avaricious desire to appropriate the jewels of the Frangistan captain to their own use. But the Dey knew too well the power of England to detain a ship which he supposed to belong to her; though there is but little doubt that he would have invented some pretext for getting the captain in his power, did he sail under a less powerful flag. They were received on board of the corsair with marked ceremony; a sort of swinging bridge, covered with rich carpets, being let down into the caique for the princess to walk upon. Belfort stood on the right of the corsair, also dressed in a rich suit of velvet, embroidered with gold; and receiving the princess, while the corsair received the Dey, he led her to a carpet spread for her on deck under a handsome canopy. Here she seated herself with her slaves on either hand. She was not now so indifferent and lost in her sad thoughts as when in the caique, but her large dark eyes were in motion as if earnestly searching for some one. The Georgian was also very eagerly surveying the people on the decks. But they could neither of them discover the person that they hoped to see—the young American whom they had assisted to escape! The princess knew he had succeeded in leaving the Palace, and the Dey had sent messengers every way to search for him, swearing by Allah he would take off his head if he were taken. The princess finding him gone had held on to the slender thread of hope his departure offered to her grasp; and now wistfully sought him on board. Not beholding him, she closely scrutinized the face of the corsair to see if there was in it any feeling of desire to serve her; but it was cold and stern. The face of the lieutenant seemed to her to express sympathy as she met his eye, but she feared lest she should be deceived and dared not hope. In the meanwhile, the bridal treasures of the princess were being brought on board from the loaded cacique. The corsair in person superintended the shipping of these valuable parcels, while the Dey, by his side, ostentatiously enumerated their names and value, as if desirous of giving the Infidel Giaour a large idea of his wealth and magnificence. `That box contains an aroma vase of sapphire porcelain studded with diamonds. It is worth four thousand piastres! It was a present to me from the Sultan.' `It seems heavy!' answered the corsair. `Bosh—'tis nothing. Here comes a vase of solid gold set with a hundred and one rubies, each the size of an antelope's eye!' `What may be the worth of it?' `Five thousand piastres! Bosh—but 'tis nothing.' `What is this bale your highness?' `Carpets from Persian looms. There are seven, and each one cost a thousand golden piastres.' `You are generous to your daughter, your Highness,' said the corsair with sparkling eyes. `Bosh—'tis nothing,' answered the Dey with contempt. Here comes on board something for Frangist eyes to look at!' `It is a large and heavy package, your Highness. What may it contain?' `Shawls from the East! There are a round dozen of them, and each is worth fifteen hundred piastres!' `You are munificent, noble Dey.' `Bir chey yok! 'tis a trifle! She is my daughter!' `Here seem to be boxes containing jewels.' `They are most rare and beautiful! There are tiaras, and chains for the neck, and bracelets, and single gems of value. I would not sell them, Frangist, for less than fifty thousand piastres! In those square boxes are golden moidores and sequins to the amount of eighty thousand Spanish pesos!' The eyes of the corsair betrayed his pleasure. Next followed bales and packages, containing napkins of muslin, fine as gossamer, and exquisitely embroidered and fringed with silk and silver; gilded vases to hold rose-water; gold and silver bird-cages containing singing birds; and other articles too numerous to detail. `Inshallah! that's an end!' exclaimed the Dey, as the last parcel was laid upon the deck. `Now, noble captain of Frangist, you will give me under your hand and seal a receipt for these packages!' `That I will do, your Highness.' `Besides these, I give my daughter one hundred slaves, which I shall despatch to Tunis tomorrow by land under proper escort. When you return to England tell your King how the Dey of Algiers endows his daughter!' `I will not fail to do so, most noble Dey!' answered the corsair. `I now entrust to thee, Frangist, my daughter and her bridal portion!— The embassador of Tunis will bear her company with a small retinue; his other attendants, whom you could not admit on board, will go with the caravan. Now Allah be with thee and cause thee safely to convoy my daughter to the Dey of Tunis. When she is safely delivered into his hand, the embassador will pay the thousand sequins, according to my royal pledge given thee. Art thou content, Frangist?' `It is enough. I am content.' The ceremony of leave taking having passed in due form, the Dey left the galleon and entered his gilded caique, under the fire of a salute. The sails of the ship were then loosed, her anchor weighed, and with her topsails sheeted home, she yielded her bows to the light morning breeze, and was in a few minutes moving slowly out from under the batteries of the castle. When the Dey reached the land she was full a mile distant, with her top-gallantsails and royals set, and standing majestically out of the harbor. He ascended the terrace of his pa'ace to watch her, and in two hours she was scarcely visible on the horizon in the direction of Tunis. The princess remained on deck watching the towers and minarets of her native city receding in the distance; and when at length they were lost to her gaze, she turned away and wept; not so much at her departure from Algiers, but at the reflection that each moment was now bringing her nearer Tunis, which was but four days sail. All at once an exclamation of joyful surprise escaped the Georgian's lips. The Princess looked up and heard her repeat,—`The young Frangist gardener!' She followed the direction of her gaze, and beheld approaching her the prisoner she had assisted to escape. His face wore a smile of satisfaction. He approached her and said, `Noble princess Xerifa, to you I owe my liberty! I have made use of it to serve you!' `And yet I am embarked and on my way to Tunis! Thou hast not served me, Frangist!' she said in a tone of reproach. `Having escaped, noble princess, I reached this ship in safety. My first act was to make known your story to the captain! He listened with interest and promised to aid you. He advised me to send a messenger to the Prince of the Desert to meet the ship at the old port of Trabac, a day's sail this side of Tunis, where he said he would put in and deliver you up to him. I immediately returned on shore and sought out a faithful man, whom I at once despatched to the Prince Haroun Almad, with intelligence of your situation. He will reach the prince by tomorrow morning; and in three days, by the time this ship gets up with Trabac, he will be there to receive you!' The Princess Xerifa listened with surprise and incredulity. She hardly dared believe so much good news! Smiles and joy, nevertheless, took the place of despondency, and her fine eyes kindled with hope. Ilda looked as if she would have danced with joy. She threw herself at the feet of the princess and kissed them, and expressed her joy in the most enthusiostic language. In the meanwhile, a scene was passing in the cabin in which the princess was deeply interested. Belfort had seen from the expression of the corsair's eyes when the treasure came on board, that he determined to appropriate it. This suspicion was confirmed by the manner in which he disposed of it. Instead of placing it in the part of the ship which was most appropriate for it, he had it conveyed into the cabin and stowed in a place where he kept his own private treasures. Having thus disposed of it, Kidd locked the place and placed the ponderous key in his belt. Belfort seeing this resolved to make known to him his suspicions. `I may offend you, captain,' he said firmly; `but I suspect you intend foul play towards the princess!' `You won't offend me,' answered Kidd, smiling with a reckless air; `hut there is not another man who would long keep his head on his shoulders, who would take the liberties with me you see fit to do!' `Then I will take the liberty to ask, do you mean to fulfil pour promise to me, to convey this lady safely to Tunis?' `Perhaps she prefers landing this side of Tunis!' answered the corsair with a smile. `True! I have sent the prisoner whom she assisted in escaping, to make known to her what has been agreed upon. He is here.' `Well, sir, what says the princess?' demanded the corsair of the young American. `That she has not words to express her gratitude to you for your proposition to land her!' `Then she would not be taken to Tunis?' `No, captain! She looks forward only to landing at Trabac!' `Well and good! You may retire! Now, my lord, what say you? Shall I take the lady to Tunis, or land her at Trabac? Shall I fulfil my promise to you or not?' `No, In landing her where she may meet the Prince, or if he does not come in time, may be sent to him, you will equally meet my wishes!' `Do I indeed!' he repeated ironically. `I am happy to know I have succeeded in pleasing my moral and fastidious lieutenant.' `You will then leave her at Trabac?' `Yes.' `And all her treasures?' `That is another thing!' `You will not despoil her of her bridal portion!' said Belfort, with indignation flashing from his eyes. `If this Desert Prince takes her he must take her portionless. `You pledged your word to me to take her and her treasures in safety to Tunis!' Belfort now saw a dilemma of which the wily corsair would not fail to take advantage. `I suspected you had an eye to her treasure!' `I will not take it without her consent!' `Will you swear to this!' `Cheerfully! Let her be questioned Call the American to interpret between us.' The young American accompanied them into the presence of the princess, who still remained on deck beneath her canopy. `Ask her,' said the corsair, `whether she prefers going to Tunis with her treasures, or landing at Trabac without them. She is at liberty to make choice of either!' The American started at this question. He already had his suspicions of the character of the vessel awakened by some things he had seen seen and heard on board, and this question seemed to him to confirm them. Nevertheless he put the inquiry to the princess. `If the Frangist captain desires to keep my treasures let him, if he will safely place me in the hand of Prince Haroun,' she said earnestly, yet not without a look of surprise cast at the corsair. `You hear that,' Belfort,' said Kidd, as the American interpreted her answer. `Now you see I am not a robber so bad as you thought. It is a fair bargain. She considers this Prince Haroun, if fairly weighed, of equal value with her gold and jewels. I give her the prince for her treasures. It is a fair exchange, my lord Honesty!' Belfort bit his lip and was about to reply; when he thought it best to be silent and for the present let it pass with a smile. On the morning of the fourth day after leaving Algiers, the corsair arrived in sight of the ruined fortress of the ancient Port of Trabac. The galleon was sailing along within half a league of the shore and steering directly for the haven. The shores were broken into hills covered with verdure, between which could be caught glimpses of the vast plains which lose themselves in the Great Desert. By this time, Owen Loring pretty well understood the character of the vessel in which he had embarked, and in his own mind resolved if possible to leave her when the princess did; for he felt he should prefer the desert to the deck of a pirate. But Belfort, who had seen much of him, discovering his fears and divining his intentions, said to him privately:— `You are desirous of quitting this vessel at Trabac. It is my wish you should remain on board. I am your friend and can serve you. I may need 4 your assistance yet here. Remain! Appear to the corsair to be engaged in his interests, and to fancy particularly the idea of sailing under his flag. In the meanwhile remain true to me. All are not friends of the corsair who sail with him. There is a plot on foot for his destruction! I know that you are brave and of honest princlples. I have confided in you because from what I have seen in you I know I can trust you. Let the princess depart, and let the captain retain her treasures. The hour of his judgment is not far off!' The young American, reassured by these words, resolved to abide the issue, and stand by the lieutenant who had placed this confidence in him. As the galleon neared the harbor, both Belfort and Kidd, each with a spy-glass, closely reconnoitred the shore and the heights beyond; but they could see nothing moving save a few goats browsing upon the hill-side, and a troop of wild-asses feeding among the herbage of a rocky ravine. The princess looked no less earnestly in search of some signs of the presence of the prince. The ship kept on her course in the harbor, and came to anchor about a cable's length from the snow-which beach and close by the ruins of the old Moorish fortress of Trabac. `If this princely lover does not make his appearance,' said the corsair, after surveying the shore with glass, `I know of no other way than to send her to him!' `This would only expose her to death; for we have no escort to afford her,' answered Belfort. `Let us wait a day or two. Perhaps he may be here before tomorrow! The American assures me of the faithfulness of the messenger despatched to him. I will go aloft, from whence I can see over these low hills, and command a view of the plains southward!' Slinging his spy-glass beneath his arm, Belfort aseended the rigging and soon reached the main-topgallant-crosstrees. From this position he had a wide view of the shore, and his sight could penetrate inland for many miles. `What do you see?' called out the corsair from the deck, observing him long and earnestly, and with an eager manner level his glass towards the south-west. `I discern a cloud of dust just raised upon the verge of the horizon! It may, however, be caused by a wind.' `Oh that it were the dust of Haroun's troop!' exclaimed Xerifa, when the American had interpreted this in reply to her eager questions. `Fear not, princess! Although he is not now here, you will without doubt see him soon!' `The cloud increases and plainly advances,' said Belfort with animation; `and I think I can see a dark body moving beneath it!' `It must be Haroun!' cried Xerifa, when she understood this. `Such is the appearance of the horseman of the desert, when seen afar off riding with the wind!' At eventide, the day after the departure of the messenger from Algiers, the Prince Haroun Almad was seated upon a gorgeous carpet before the door of his tent, surrounded by his chiefs and warriors holding a council. He was informing them of his intention to take to wife the Princess Xerita the Dey of Algiers' daughter, and that the next morning he should proceed at the head of a thousand horse towards Algiers. This intelligence was received by them with open manifestations of joy, and all pledged themselves to stand by him with their lives. The prince then rose up and thanked them with a grace of manner and courtesy of words that singularly became him. He was not more than twenty-five, with a noble and symmetrical person, fine dark eyes and handsome Arabian features, with an expression of pride and independence upon his lip and brow. He was dressed in a casque of shining steel, inlaid with gold, and shaded by a snowy plume; he wore a green camesk of silk over a shirt of mail, full Turkish trowsers, with high scarlet boots of gilded morocco. and golden spurs. His belt glittered with diamonds, and in it was stuck a pair of gold mounted pistols with remarkably long barrels, and suspended from it by chains of silver swung a flashing Greek yatagan. He had hardly ceased speaking his thanks to his people, when one of the mounted videttes, which, for leagues, were kept always posted around the camp of the prince at certain intervals, came riding in with the intelligence that a single horseman was galloping towards the camp from the north. `Advance and meet him, and know who he is, and what is his object in approaching us!' said the prince. Three young men instantly sprung upon their horses together, and flew over the plain at a speed that would have mocked the flight of a falcon.— They were soon seen to meet him and then to let fall the points of their lances and turn back escorting him to the camp. `Who comes?' demanded the prince as they came near. `A messenger from the princess Xerifa,' answered one of the young men. `Welcome, stranger! What news dost thou bear?' Ali, though spent with his hundred leagues of hard riding, during which he had changed horses no less than twelve times, in a few words related the story. The Prince listened with surprise and a cloud of fierce anger gathered upon his brow. `Now, by the soul of the Prophet! this dey of Tunis shall be punished for his presumption! To horse and let us ride for Trabac. It is three days journey, but we must leave the ostrich behind in our rapid march!' At the rising of the moon that night, Prince Haroun started at the head of three thousand horse, and shaped his course across the desert in the direction of the sea.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER IX. The Prince. `There is no mistaking the origin of that cloud upon the plain now,' said Belfort. `I can see distinctly beneath it a body of horse and can detect even the glancing of armor in the sun-light. Now they widen their columns and show a very large troop of horse. They are galloping onward at the top of their speed and each moment their number seems enlarging. It seems an army of mounted cavalry with more than a hundred camels!' I see banners waving, and hark! I hear the notes of a bugle!' `I hear it,' answered the corsair. `Ah, now I see the head of the column between the hill and the fort. They are not a mile distant! There is no question but that it is this Prince of the Desert!' The Princess needed no interpreter now to assure her that her lover was near. She watched with eager eyes and a glance of hope upon her cheek, the advancing troop. It soon entered into the defile between the hills and came thundering down with flaunting banners and resounding clarions, towards the sea-shore. Squadron after squadron filed swiftly through the pass and drew up on the beach; till the whole body of horse drew rein in a line six deep, fronting the galleon and not a quarter of a mile distant. It was a noble and spirited spectacle to witness, and was gazed upon in silent admiration from the ship. `He must be a noble fellow, and worthy of the princess, to command such a fine body of horse,' said Kidd. `I fear he will object to your keeping her treasure,' said Belfort who was now again on deck. `He may object. I shall tell him he must be content with the Princess. He is a splendid fellow! See him dashing towards the beech to hail us. Hark! What is that he says?' he demanded of the American. `He desires to know if the princess Xerifa is on board the ship.' `Tell him that she is, and that I will send her to him. There is no question now but that this is the true lover!' `None, whatever, if we read aright the happy expression of the face of the princess,' answered Belfort. A boat was now let down and ordered along side; a carpet thrown over the stern and the princess and her slaves (whom Belfort had succeeded in prevailing on the corsair to suffer to accompany her) with the Tunisian embassador were placed in it. Kidd accompanied by Belfort then got in and took thir seats, and the boat pulled directly for the spot where the prince awaited to receive them, magnificently attired and mounted upon a charger that shone with scales of gold. By his side, led by two Ethiopian slaves was a snow white palfrey for her to ride. The prince alighted and running forward embraced Xerifa by kissing her on both cheeks, and then leaning from her to whom she owed her deliverence from the hands of the Dey of Tunis, he turned towards the corsair and expressed his thanks and gratitude with manly warmth and energy; and taking from his own neck a chain of gold set with diamonds he threw it over that of the corsair. To Belfort, for the princess did not neglect him, he also expressed his thanks and forced upon his acceptance his sword studded with diamonds. To the young American of whose important services he was informed by the grateful Xerifa he presented a dagger of great value that literally blazed with jewels. `These presents,' he said, `are but poor expressions of my gratitude for the possession of a jewel of priceless value in this fair princess whom you have brought me. I shall always think of the Frangist with affection and friendship!' Desirous of getting off with his treasure before the princess informed him of its detention (for he knew that the prince might forcibly detain him a prisoner if he saw fit, till it was restored to the princess) Kidd made a brief reply and gave orders to put off from the shore. As the boat pushed off the Tunisian Embassador threw himself into the water to reach it with a look of great anxiety and terror. He had hardly done so when at a signal from the prince to whom the princess was explaining who he was, several of his party spurred into the water and seized him. `What means this?' cried Kidd in surprise. `The princess has told who he is,' answered the American, `and the prince says he shall die. It is this that caused him to run towards the boat.' `Let us turn back and demand his life, and that he be sent in safety to Tunis!' cried Beltort. `No. Let the prince do with him as he chooses. It will be some satisfaction to him to have this little vengeance allowed him. He will feel bethumored after it.' Belfort did not reply; for his attention with that of the corsair was at once taken up by a scene on the land. The embassador, on being taken from the water, was led by his captors to the prince, who seemed to address him with great anger. He was stripped of his shawl and turban, two men forced him upon his knees, while a third at a signal from the prince advanced with a drawn yataghan. The circling weapon flashed in the sun above his head and the next instant descended upon the neck of the victim, and the head of the Tunisian Embassador bounded twenty feet distant and rolled into the waves. `That prince is a man after my own heart,' said Kidd with a smile. `I am well pleased that I have done him the service I have, in giving him his bride.' `He would have been better pleased had you not first robbed her!' `I will settle that matter with him, some day when we happen to meet in the desert.' They had hardly got on board, when they clearly saw that there was some new cause of agitation on shore. The prince was riding up and down the shore talking in a loud tone and pointing towards the galleon with fierce and animated gestures. `Listen, American! What is all this?' cried Kidd. `I can only distinguish the words `pirate'—`robber'—`treasure!” answered the young man with some hesitation. `You can, eh! Well! the prince may bark as much as he lists. I can laugh at him here!' `They are manœuvring strangely!' said Belfort. `See! the camels are advancing to the front, and yonder gallops a hundred horse into the fort! The prince is giving orders with great earnestness.' `We are beyond their reach. They have no boats and can only buzz,' said the corsair scornfully laughing. `I am not so confident they will not harm us! There is a falconet* * A small piece of artillery of two or three pound calibre often used in desert warfare at that period. slung on the back of every one of those camels! And see they have found cannot in the fort and are lifting them into the embrasures! They will yet do us mischief if we lie here!' `The moorish dogs! Is this their prince's gratitude?' cried the corsair roused like a tiger at these demonstrations. `But for you Belfort, I would have drowned the princess and so had her wealth without claimants. These howling hounds will yet do damage to my spars if they have powder and ball to fire those pieces! All hands to get underweigh! Up with the an chor! Lively, lively! Loose the top-sails and jib, some of ye! Spring to it! There is just wind enough for steerage way. How far will those falconets throw a ball, Belfort?, There was no need of a verbal reply. He had hardly spoken before a regular cannonading was opened upon the galleon within cable's length, or eight hundred feet off the beach, from the falconets slung upon the backs of the camels which were ranged in a line at a point nearest the ship. The balls passed through the sails, cut the cordage and shivered the bulwarks, passing through them wounding and killing the men. Orders were immediately given by Kidd to the men who were weighing the anchor to cut the cable and man the guns. The Arabs in the fort, in the meanwhile, succeeded in elevating a heavy gun to the embrasures, and bringing it to bear upon the galleon, loaded it and filled it with stones instead of ball. Seeing this, the corsair ordered an eighteen pounder to be levelled at this party and discharged; but the shot,as the ship was swinging round,fell to far too the left. The Arabs at the same time discharged their piece and a shower of stones rattled upon the deck and sides of the galleon, doing an immense deal of mischief to the spars and rigging and wounding no less than eleven men. The gun, however, burst at the breech in the discharge, and the pirates had the satisfaction of seeing half a score of the enemy turning somerset in the air without head or limbs. The galleon as she swung round to the wind, fired one after another her starboard guns among the dense body of horse; but most of the shot flew high above their heads. The falconets in the mean time kept up an incessant fire, and as they discharged their blunderbusses and pistols also,they were in the midst of a tempest of leaden hail for ten minutes. During this time Kidd paced the deck like an enraged lion. To attempt to retaliate by landing with his boats, he knew would have been madness, for he would assuredly have been overwhelmed and cut to pieces! Flight was his only alternative, and to this he was but little accustomed. The fire of the small arms first fell short, and but now and then a shot from a falconet would reach her; for at the last they drove their camels into the water up to their backs to get within range. When, at length, Kidd found himself out of reach of the falconets, he ordered the galleon to be hove to; and then he prepared to open his broadside upon the enemy, for he had not yet been able to bring it to bear. But, as if anticipating this, the Prince on finding his shot no longer reached the ship, commanded his horse to retire in a body. The corsair, therefore, before his men could man the guns, saw them to his infinite chagrin, moving rapidly from the beach, and retreating at full speed through the defiles between the hills. He, however, discharged his pieces, though without any visible effect. In five minutes, the reer of the column had got far beyond reach of his shot, with the additional advantage, which it had had from the first of its retreating, of having the fort in a range between them and the ship. From aloft, the retiring body of horse could for a long while be seen covering the plain and advancing southward with glittering scimetars and streaming flags, with the far off sound of the warlike bugle swelling along the breeze. `Well, let them go,' said the corsair. I have the treasure and he has the princess! He is a brave chief and has done well, though to my damage.— We have lost twelve men fairly killed and nineteen wounded. This is a large number out of a crew of but ninety-four! It will take full two days to repair damages; and for this purpose we must anchor here!' `And when we put to sea again, shall I be gratified in my wish?' asked Belfort. `Name it, Belfort.' `To visit the Gibraltar and perhaps the West Indies!' `Well, I promised you! I will keep it!' `You will go after no more princesses?' `No, by mine honor! You may command my movements if you wish it for the next three months. I am in good humor; for I have been more successful than I have been for a year past. The galleon did not yield me as much gold in her capture as I anticipated. The jewels of the Princess make it up to me!' By the following day the galleon had repaired all damages, and set sail towards the west. On the eighth day afterwards she came in sight of the Pillars of Hercules, and the same evening at sunset lay becalmed within two leagues of Gibraltar. The port and shipping were all in sight, and among the latter several vessels of war. `What are you watching so earnestly with the glass, my lord?' said the corsair as he observed Belfort looking long and closely into port. `Merely seeing what ships are in port,' he answered coloring and slightly hesitating. He felt that he was betraying himself, and putting down the glass, he turned away before Kidd noticed his confusion. `There are too many vessels in harbor for me to venture in,' said Kidd, a few moments afterwards. `They have no doubt missed their galleon, and some war vessel will come running down on board of us the first breeze.— Besides, I have no business in Gibraltar. To tell you the truth, Belfort, I am getting tired of the sea. I am now rich—rich as I desire to be. I have a fancy to purchase me some vast domain in the colonies, and under an assumed name there dwell, and marry, and build up a noble name for my posterity. I am tired of a buccaneer's life. America is young and ambitious. She will one day cast off her allegiance, and I will be a leader in it. If you still fancy to roam the sea in quest of adventure, I will, on reaching the Americas,resign to you my command!' `I have no desire to follow the dangerous career of a corsair, I have told you. I but resumed it, from misanthropy and attachment to you. My heart as you see is not in it!' `That I plainly perceive. You are overrunning with the milk of humanity. You have almost made me loth to shed a man's blood; yet I have not been backward at this in my day. This idea of settling in the colonies has long taken my fancy; and I meant to carry it out when I got wealth enough. There is an island of great extent on the south of New England, possessing a genial climate which I desire to obtain. Now I will sail with you to the West Indies, according to my promise, and after falling in with some English merchantman, I will capture her, sink the galleon, and so run into New York in the new vessel, representing myself as an India merchant of great wealth. If I go in in the galleon I shall be suspected, as the news of her capture at Corsica will spread over the world. At all events I must get rid of the galleon and take another vessel!' `Will you promise, for my sake, to touch at Jamaica first?' `Yes, though it is a great risk. There is an English squadron usually cruising about there, and I should be sorry to be captured just as I am making plans for leading an honest life. But I will do it, as I promised you! Moreover, I have fifty thousand dollars in kegs on the Kingston head, in the sand, which I wish to recover! But the wind is springing up! and there is a Spanish vessel of war getting underweigh! Let us take the first fannings of the breeze to leave the rock behind! It is well there is no English man-of-war in port, or we should have been boarded by her boats long ago!' The galleon caught the breeze and setting her sails to it, stood westward into the Atlantic Ocean. The next morning the rock of Gibraltar was just visible like the faint outline of a cloud peering above the horizon. Thirty four days after leaving the straits the galleon came in sight of the mountains of Jamaica, having fallen in with no vessel during the passage. Gradually as it approached the island the blue highlands assumed a green tint, and forests and fields were delineated by the eye, and as the distance each moment lessened, villas and hamlets became distinguishable to the unassisted vision. The port of Kingston was in sight three leagues more southwardly, and with a glass the shipping could be seen at anchor in the harbor. `I am willing to run down the coast within a league of the town, and then come to at dark to give you an opportunity to go on shore, while I unearth my kegs of dollars hid there three years ago,' said Kidd. `I shall recommend to you every caution. I will be busy with my boats, bringing the money while you are at the city. You see I am placing every confidence in you; for, my good lord, I have conceived, I hardly know in what way, a suspicion of your good faith. You have not seemed the man you once were since you have been with me this second time. By the rood; you should have remained on shore and not brought to me such a dull visage! Something is on your mind, and you do not often smile. I have suspected, to tell you frankly, that you were planning a mutiny and wished to take possession of the ship and put me out of the way. But I have sounded the men and find you are not a favorite with any of them. There is not a man of them but has doubts whether you are a true man among us! Nevertheless I think I know you, and that you would not deceive me. I let you go on shore to see your old friends as you desire, while I get my money on board! I would go with you, but I am too well known in the streets of Kingston, if anything should detain me till daylight!' `What reason have I given you to suspect me?' asked Belfort, calmly. `What is it you fear from me?' `Nothing, now! I do not fear you will betray my presence here to any English man-of-war, for you are as much implicated as myself. I have only had suspicions of your desire to supplant me in my command!' `This has been farthest from my thoughts,' answered Belfort. The ship was hove to, the boat was brought alongside, and Belfort got into it. Kidd also sprung in after him, intending to land with six men at tke point a mile this side of the entrance to the post, to dig for his kegs, while Belfort proceeded on foot across the promontory to the town. It was already dark when the boat set out from the ship; and as it landed at the place designated by the corsair, the moon had risen and poured a flood of light upon the scene of ocean, rocks, castle and distant town, with the dark blue mountains in the distance. `Ho! whither do you go, American?' cried the corsair, as Owen Loring started off to follow Belfort on his expedition. `Remain here!' `I should prefer he would accompany me,' said Belfort. `I prefer he should remain! I should never lay eyes on him again, and I find him too useful as a clerk to let him go. Stay here, young man, and take fair account of the kegs as they are unearthed!' Belfort looked closely at the face of the corsair, as well as he could see its expression by the moonlight, to ascertain if this step was occasioned by suspicion. But he could discover nothing to lead him to believe so; though well knowing the pirate captain had good grounds for suspecting both of them of treachery. After a moment's hesitation, Belfort proceeded on his way alone, after first glancing at the young man, and conveying to him a look of encouragement. Belfort soon disappeared over the hill, for he well knew the path and the pirates proceeded to dig for their treasure midway between two rocks, beneath a cocoa tree growing upon the edge of the beach and bank. The place pointed out by the pirate was thoroughly dug without success. Several other points were searched with equally fruitless results, when he finally commanded the men to cease their labors, being satisfied that some of his former officers had been before him! This conviction by no means increased his good humor, and without waiting for Belfort he resolved to return on board. As he entered the boat a paper upon the bottom of it caught his eye. He took it up and discovered that it was an envelope, addressed simply to `Mr. Belfort.' A heavy seal was attached to it, but broken. He opened it and by the moonlight read as follows: “Admiralty, London. May 2d, 1700. Sir,—By command of His Majesty, I enclose you a despatch to the captains or commanders of any vessels of war lying in the port of Gibraltar, Spain, or Kingston in Jamaica, or wherever these despatches may find them, to put themselves under your directions, for the purpose expressed in their instructions, viz: the capture of the freebooter, William Kidd, and bringing him (if possible) to trial, in this our England. Trusting that you will be successful in taking him, through the aid of His Majesty's vessels of war, and that you will prove yourself worthy in all respects of the confidence His Majesty has graciously seen fit to repose in you, I am, &amp;c. &amp;c. Signed, Abington. When Kidd had finished reading this, he sprung to his feet as if he had been bitten by a serpent. He examined the envelope for more writing, and then looked round for any other papers that might have been dropped by Belfort. `Ah, ha!' he muttered through his shut teeth. `So I have it! This is his purpose, hey? the arch-traitor! For this he left England and sought me at Gibraltar! For this he has joined me again, sailed with me, and urged me to cruise about England, and then when I refused, to sail hither! This is his treacherons friendship! I have not suspected him without cause! He has stuck to me till he could bring me into the snare I must be seized and carried to England forsooth! This is the wish of His Majesty. He would be sure that it is myself and no counterfeit. He would give the world assurance that I am fairly caught, and hung at Tyburn! Well, well! good master Belfort! I have discovered this treason in good time. I would wait for thee and cause thee to swing for this at my fore-yard, did I not fear being pounced upon by a British cruiser. There is no question now why you should go ashore at Kingston! It is doubtless to send a frigate after me! Bueno! they must have a long chase if they would catch me! Ho! men on board! a-board! We have had a traitor among us! Pull for the ship! In less than an hour we shall have a British frigate or two coming round the point walking after us with my lord Belfort on her deck! By the mass! I would I had discovered this conspiracy while he was in my power!' The boat shot across the moonlit waves at a rapid rate, and in half an hour Kidd stood once more upon his quarter-deck. In a few words he briefly informed his officers and men what he had discovered, and the probability, as British vessels of war were always lying in Kingston, of being at once pursued. The crew growling forth deep imprecations against Belfort, aided in making sail, for Kidd had ordered everything to be set that she could carry. `Did you know ought of this treachery?' demanded Kidd of the young American, after the ship was under full sail standing northward. `No, captain,' answered the young man firmly. `It is well you are innocent! But it is not likely he would have a confidant! Yet you were much in conversation, and my slave Cinqua told me he heard you say you would escape the first opportunity.' `It is natural I should wish to revisit my home after two years captivity,' answered the young colonist. `I have a mother and sisters, and also one dearer to whom I was betrothed!' `Well! if we are successful in escaping the pursuit, you may yet see them soon! I am going to run for New England, and in some obscure bay ground the galleon, and thence reach Boston with my treasures!' Kidd now swept his night-glass along the shore, southward, in the direction of the port, and seeing nothing that looked like a sail in pursuit, he began thoughtfully to pace his quarter-deck, meditating upon the surprising treason of Belfort, and upon his own future prospects.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Admiralty, London. May 2d, 1700. Sir,—By command of His Majesty, I enclose you a despatch to the captains or commanders of any vessels of war lying in the port of Gibraltar, Spain, or Kingston in Jamaica, or wherever these despatches may find them, to put themselves under your directions, for the purpose expressed in their instructions, viz: the capture of the freebooter, William Kidd, and bringing him (if possible) to trial, in this our England. Trusting that you will be successful in taking him, through the aid of His Majesty's vessels of war, and that you will prove yourself worthy in all respects of the confidence His Majesty has graciously seen fit to repose in you, I am, &amp;c. &amp;c. Signed, Abington.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER X. The Last of the Galleon. Belfort reached the town in less than half an hour after quitting the party of pirates. Familiar with the place he proceeded at once to the residence of the British Consul, and was ushered into his presence. Without saying a word to him he handed him a letter, addressed, `To any of His Majesty's Consuls abroad.' The consul opened it and read as follows: Sir;—You are hereby desired to furnish such information respecting British vessels in your waters, as the bearer, Mr. Belfort, may have occasion to require on the secret service in which he is engaged, and also to further his purposes, which he will make known to you, with every aid at your command. Signed, Abington, Admiralty Office.” `Mr. Belfort, you may command me! How can I serve you?' answered the consul. `Is there any British vessel of force in port?' `There is the Serapis 74, and the frigate Queen Anne; besides two sloops of twenty guns, and the brig Nettle of sixteen!' `The frigate and brig will be both required—one for shoal water,' he answered. `The service I desire them for I will briefly make known! I am one of the young officers, who, with William Kidd, declared ourselves free from any allegiance to the crown, and madly hoisted the free flag! As I am of a noble family, and am heir to the title of Earl of —, and as I, three years ago, left Kidd voluntarily, and have since lived a life of retirement, the King has graciously condescended to pardon my offences past, on condition I would enter into a plan to betray the pirate chief, with whom I had formerly sailed. This I promised His Majesty, at a personal interview with which he honored me, that I would do if in my power. His Majesty was pleased, after hearing my plan, to recommend me to the Admiralty, from whom I have received letters to command the aid of any ships that should be in those seas where I might find Kidd. Armed with these letters I left England, and after some some search found Kidd near Gibraltar. Under pretence of wishing to unite my fortunes with his again, I joined his ship, into which he gladly received me After some difficulty I have succeeded in bringing him and his vessel into the vicinity of a British station. I could have arrested him before or slain him, but it is His Majesty desire he and his vessel should be captured, and himself taken to England for execution. With great art and not a little danger of leading him to suspect my motives, I have induced him to come into these waters. His vessel is now lying to, within a league of the port to the northward. I have left him not an hour since. He and a party of his men are on shore, not half a league from this place, digging up some treasure he left there three years ago. He expects me to return and go on board with him by midnight! I now want a party of troops to surprise him there, while a vessel gets underweigh to take his vessel!' The consul listened with unfeigned surprise at this relation. `You deserve all praise, sir, and have shown yourself worthy of His Majesty's confidence. The detachment you require shall at once be sent. How many men has he with him?' `Six.' `I will send a company. Designate the place!' `That part of the beach north of the Head, where a single cocoa grows by itself. The money they dig for is beneath the tree!' `I know the spot!' The consul immediately despatched a servant with a note to the barracks, and in a few moments the Colonel waited upon him, to whom he communicated the duty required. `I will command in this matter myself,' answered the officer, leaving the apartment. `Now I will accompany you on board the frigate,' said the consul. `My barge is manned and in waiting. On reaching the `Queen Anne,' Belfort was introduced to the captain, Sir Charles Percy, to whom he presented a letter from the Admiralty. Sir Charles read it with surprise, and surveyed the bearer with curiosity. The consul then briefly made known to him the narrative of events which had been communicated to him by Belfort. The English captain was no sooner made acquainted with the fact, that the notorious buccaneer Kidd, the `King of the Sea,' was lying within four miles of him, than he was all animation. He seized his trumpet, and, to the astonishment of officers and men, gave orders to get underweigh. The consul, at the same time, was desired to pass in his boat to the brig Nettle, and communicate orders to weigh and follow the frigate. But with all this despatch on the part of the vessels of war, the corsair had regained the galleon, and defeated not only the ambition of the colonel and his party to secure him; but, before the frigate got clear of the harbor, he was stretching away, under all his canvass, to the north, with his yards squared. As the dawn began to break, the corsair eagerly inspected the southern horizon with his glass, and, as the light increased, he saw gradually delineated against the sky, the tall hamper of a large ship of war, and near her a taunt, rakish looking brig. Both were under press of sail and standing after the galleon being now about eight miles distant. As the sun rose, Kidd went aloft, and with his spy-glass distinctly made them out to be a a large English frigate and a brig of war. He felt now satisfied that Belfort had brought his treachery to a consummation. Descending to the deck, he gave orders to set all the light sails and studden-sails on both sides. This additional canvass he saw forced the galleon through the water at great speed. But the frigate, which he watched closely, he saw did not fall astern, but came dashing on with `a bone in her teeth,' at the rate of nine knots; for the breeze was now blowing fresh. The corsair paced his deck with a dark and angry brow. The treachery of his lieutenant aroused all the fierce resentment of his unbridled nature. He saw that he was so successfully betrayed by him, that he could escape only by flight. The idea of fighting with a frigate and brig he felt was madness. His only alternative was to trust to the fast sailing of his galleon with the hope of escaping in the night or in a storm. Having set every thing drawing that the ship would carry he went below, and locking his cabin door on the inside, he began to open his treasures. Countless and priceless in value were the jewels which he took from his casket and placed compactly together in small packages, which he enclosed in a belt. Having loaded this with as many as it could contain, he bound it securely about his person, underneath his inner vest. He then counted his gold coin into heaps and filled canvass bags with it, which he packed in a heavy oaken chest. He then avariciously surveyed the treasure an instant, locked the chest, and placed the key in his belt. `If I am taken, the sea shall have thee before the hand of man can grasp thee!' he said, addressing the gold. `If I am likely to be taken, the galleon and all it contains shall sink beneath the waves! My hoards shall make no man rich! For these treasures I have scoured the seas and mingled human blood with the briny foam. For these I have defied human laws and made my name a by-word for crime! For these I have sold my soul to hell and shaken hands with the Fiend! No man shall profit by what has been my ruin! If I perish, all I have taken in exchange for human blood shall perish with me!' `Sir, the brig gains on us,' said his mate, calling from the companionway. `Yes,' he muttered, `I see how it is! My doom is sealed! Belfort has been commissioned by Destiny to betray me to death! I did not fear before him in my heart without cause! If I had obeyed the instinct which prompted me to fear and suspect him, and thrown him into the sea, I should not now be flying from my enemies. I shall be taken! I see that. My fate is woven and the last thread is broken! I feel the weight of this idea upon my soul. I have no spirit to meet and defy my foes! I feel like a coward who would fly before them so that he could escape with life! Avarice and love of life have taken hold of my being. I desire only to escape with my jewels! The vast trrasure of the princess I must leave too!' At this momoment the deep boom of artillery started him! `The frigate is firing, sir,' said the mate, `but as she is four miles off the shot has fallen short.' Kidd sprung to the deck and looked to windward. The frigate had gained upon him in the hour he had been below among his gold, and was now but a little more than a league distant to windward. The brig was a little nearer and both pressing after him and crowding all their canvass. `Cast overboard the four forward guns starboard and larboard!' shouted Kidd in a voice of thunder. `We have twenty-two of them and can spare a few!' In ten minutes the guns with their carriages had been hoisted over the bulwarks and plunged into the sea. `That lightens her by the head a little,' he said, after watching for a moment or two the effect. `We must make her do better still! Bear a hand and send the guns amidships, two on each side, after the others! There she flies forward!' he cried with an elated tone, as he saw the increased speed with which she moved through the water! He watched the vessels astern with intense interest, and was soon satisfied that the galleon was widening the distance that separated them. After half an hour's time he was convinced that she was running away from both. This idea filled him with the hope that he should yet succeed in making his escape. He saw with satisfaction a dark cloud gathering over the sea to the south-east, and knew that a storm would be upon them by night, when they would be compelled to take in sail and look more to themselves than to him. As he foresaw, towards the close of the day, a gale of wind burst upon them. The frigate got it first and took in all her light sails. The brig, standing on, carried away her fore-topgallant sail. In a few moments afterwards it fell upon the galleon; but the corsair, who was as good a seaman as he was a hold buccaneer, had prepared his vessel for it, and it broke over them without doing injury, and bore the galleon forward upon its wings with appalling velocity. The frigate was soon lost to the eye of the pirate, and, triumpling in this division in his favor, he let his ship drive. The storm lasted for several days, during which he had flown like the wind many hundred miles through several degrees of latitude. Twice during this interval he had seen a vessel far astern, scudding, but in the obscurity of the tempest, could not tell whether she was the frigate or a stranger, in his wake. On the weather clearing off, Kidd found himself in the latitude of Bermuda, and within four days sail of New York bay. Thither he now determined to run, satisfied that he had effectually eluded the pursuit of the frigate. On the morning of the fifth day he came in sight of Block Island, on the eastern end of Long Island; and after running eastward a few leagues, he came to anchor near Gardner's island on the north side, having first satisfied himself that no British or Dutch vessels of war were cruising in the vicinity. As soon as he dropped anchor, which was about three in the afternoon, on the eleventh day after leaving Jamaica, he pulled ashore and landing upon the beach, openly waited on the proprietor, informed him who he was, and that he had a large amount of treasure he wished to bury and to leave with him to protect, but for the security of it he would make him answer with his life. Reluctantly the proprietor of this beautiful island of the sound, received his treasures as he landed them, and gave him, at his demand, a receipt for them.* * This receipt is now extant and is as follows: `No. 1.One bag of dust gold. 2.One bag of coined gold. And one in silver. 3.One bag dust gold. 4.One bag of silver rings, and sundry precious stones. 5.One bag of unpolished stones. 6.One piece of crystal, cornelian rings, two agates, 2 amethysts. 7.One bag silver buttons and lamps. 8.One bag of broken silver. 9.One bag of gold bars. 10.One do. 11.One bag of dust gold. 12.One bag of silver bars.' Before, however, the buccaneer could land that more valuable portion of his treasures, of which he had robbed the princess Xerifa, two vessels appeared in sight, at which he took the alarm, and hastening on board the galleon, made all sail up the sound. The vessels proved afterwards to be merchant ships, and more likely to fly from him than that he should fly from them. But suspecting that they were the frigate and brig, and his fears too much aroused to wait to ascertain, he at once crowded sail to escape. The next evening he passed down through Hurl Gate, and in two hours afterwards, after satisfying himself that there were no vessels of war in New Amsterdam, as New York was then called, he boldly dropped anchor between the battery and Governor's Island. He immediately went on shore and waited on the Governor, Lord Bellamont, to whom, speaking in broken English, he represented himself as a Spanish captain, who had been driven from his course by storms, and put into New York bay for provisions and water; of which the corsair was indeed in great want. While his lordship was courteously conversing with him, and promising to send on board such provisions as he required, a rumor came that a frigate was in sight, coming up the harbor. Without ceremony Kidd sprung to his feet and hastened to the quay, where his boat lay; and immediately leaping into it, he pulled on board his ship. The frigate was not three miles off, standing up the harbor with English colors flying. A glance at her told the corsair that it was the frigate that had put out after him from Kingston. Before he got on board he shouted aloud his orders to loosen the sails and cut the cable. He sprung upon deck and inspiring his men to exertion, the galleon in four minutes was wearing round to the wind, and soon was moving before it. `What shall be done?' asked his chief officer. `The wind is south and we cannot escape to sea. We must run before it up North River. The frigate cannot follow as far as I dare lead! At the last I can sink the galleon or run her ashore! There is no alternative! This fellow tracks us like a sleuth hound. The brig I hope has gone to the bottom! `No! there she comes in a league astern!' said the man, at this moment discovering her. `Then the devil has favored them. When he gets against me in this game I may as well give up beaten! We must run her up the river as high as we can, and then ground her and burn her, getting on shore as much treasure as possible!' The officers of the frigate, on entering the harbor and discovering with their glasses the galleon riding at anchor, could scarcely believe the evidence of their senses. Not having seen her since the storm, they suspected she had gone down, though they stood on with a faint hope that she might have rode out the long tempest, and reached the destination which Belfort had previously learned from Kidd he intended to make. `Now, my lord,' said Sir Charles Percy to Belfort; `we have earthed the fox, and will soon have him! See! he has discovered us and is running for it!' `He takes the river up!' cried Belfort. There is no escape for him now! His fate is sealed!' `And you will then have fairly earned your Earldom and estates, my friend,' said Sir Charles. `We are within range I think. Let us send a shot and measure our distance! This is the luckiest thing in the world, falling in with the chase here!' The frigate finding her shot reach, kept up a quick and well-directed fire upon the galleon, which she returned from her stern guns with considerable effect. The frigate, however, soon finding that she lost distance by firing, ceased and crowded sail. The brig, in the meanwhile, having discovered the enemy, pressed ahead and joined in the chase. The galleon kept on about two miles ahead, still standing up the river and sailing at about six knots with the wind nearly aft. Night fell upon them at least ten leagues up the river, and yet neither the frigate nor brig had come within pointblank range. At intervals they would fire a shot, which would be returned by the corsair. In this manner they entered, about ten o'clock at night, among the dark wild mountains of the Highlands. The shadows of the overhanging precipices made the night blacker, and rendered the pilot unable to distinguish the land from the water. Suddenly, while running beneath the towering crag of Dunderbergh, the corsair felt a shock through his vessel, which told him that she had struck upon a rock. He had just come to the determination that if he would escape, he must run his vessel ashore. She had hardly struck when some of the men from below rushed on deck crying that the ship was going down! He heard torrents of water rushing into the hold, as they spoke, in confirmation of their words. `Belfort has conquered!' he said in a deep tone. `We are sinking men!' he cried out, `but the shore is at hand! Let every man save himself!' His order was instantly obeyed. The pirates seizing their bags of gold and silver, and jumped into the water to swim ashore.' `I can save nothing but what is in my belt; but,' he said with a sort of bitter satisfaction,' what I leave no man shall possess after me! Is the ship clear?' he called in a voice of thunder. There was no reply from any one on board. Every man had left the fast-sinking galleon. As he called she surged heavily and fell broadly onher side, and seemed to stick fast! `This will not do! If the deep waters here will not receive her and my treasures fire shall befriend me!' As he spoke he struck a light and throwing combustible materials into the cabin he ignited them. He was compelled to rush to the deck,so sudden was the spreading of the fierce element he had called to his aid. The flames shot out of the cabin windows, and poured upward through the sky-light, while dark volumes of smoke rolled from the companion-way! `Farewell, good ship!' he cried as he prepared to leap into the water.— `It will be long before I tread a deck again!' The frigate had held on in the pursuit until the night had veiled the chase from her sight, and still she kept steadily on her way, occasionally firing, and burning blue lights at intervals to reveal the pirate to their view. But Kidd did not fire after dark, lest the flash should show them where he was; and it had been his intention to double upon them in the darkness, and passing them so escape out to sea. But the blue lights which the frigate sent up, which cast the glare of noon for a moment upon every place within a league, showed him that this course was out of the question. He therefore determined to run his vessel on shore, when she struck, as has been narrated. Sir Charles and Belfort were walking the deck together, and speaking of the vast amount of treasure which Kidd had in possession on board the chase, when all at once they saw a bright flame shoot up into the air, and flash along the waters. `By St. George! the fellow has set his ship on fire!' cried Sir Charles. `She is evidently ashore from her position,' cried Belfort. `See how the flames dart upward and outward! The cliff overhanging them is all illuminated! She is close in with the land!' `They have stranded her and set her on fire! Crowd on all sail, Mr. Berry,' he cried to the first lieutenant. `We must reach her in time to extinguish the flames and preserve his booty!' The frigate, however, with all her canvass, was unable to reach her in time. The flames swept along the decks, curled up the masts, and every rope became a line of fire. The heat discharged gun after gun, the echoes of which reverberated like thunder among the dark mountains around.— Suddenly the bright flames were enveloped in a dense volume of blackest smoke, and the next instant, amid the deafening roar of the explosion of the magazine, the air was filled with myriads of flaming fragments, which circling in wide arcs fell like shooting meteors into the river,and were extinguished in sudden night. `There is the end of the Pirate's ship at least!' said Sir Charles, turning to Belfort. `No doubt of his treasure too!' `Yes. There is no doubt that it has gone down with it!' answered the English captain in an accent of chagrin and vexation. There remains but little now to be told. Landing the next morning at the place where the hull of the galleon had sunk, Belfort learned from the Dutch inhabitants, that Kidd and his men had taken to the forests and said they should pursue their way to Boston through the wilderness. Thither Sir Charles sailed without delay, and Belfort had the satisfaction, nine days afterwards, of arresting Kidd in person at a low inn in Ann street, where he passed as an English captain, who had lost his ship in the Sound. The resentful and bitter denunciations of the pirate upon the head of Belfort, may be more readily conceived than we can repeat them. The corsair, bound in chains, was taken in the frigate to England, tried, executed, and hung in chains, in Execution Dock, the 12th of May, 1701. Belfort received the thanks of the crown, and as the Earl of —, afterwards married the beautiful Spanish maiden, Dona Elena, after having rescued her and her treasures from the hands of the cruel and avaricious prior, father Eustaquio, who had, subsequently, imprisoned her, and took possession of her wealth. Belfort, by means of one of the crew of the galleon, whom he met with in London, had heard of her being there, and also of the half a million which Don Ferdinand, her father, had placed in the priest's hands! How he chartered an armed vessel and sailed to Corsica; and how he discovered Dona Elena shut up in one of the deepest dungeons of the monastery; and how her gratitude to him, and his interest in her, on both sides became love; and how he punished father Eustaquio, by casting him into the same prison, from which he had released her, with many more interesting incidents and adventures which grew out of his expedition to Corsica, we must forbear relating as we should be happy to do, if the limits of our pages would permit. We, therefore, having brought our corsair to the end of his career, take leave of the kind reader, with many thanks for his patience in giving us his good company to the end of our story. THE END.</field>
