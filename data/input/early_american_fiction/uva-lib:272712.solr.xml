      <field name="fulltext">VOL. II. 2 CHAPTER I. `It is not that I dread the death; `For thou hast seen me, by thy side, `All redly through the battle ride.' `Captain Oadley,' said Washington, to my brother, as we entered his quarters, about an hour after our arrest; there was something exceedingly solemn in his tone; `how happens it, sir, that I see you with your side arms?' Archibald stood proudly, yet reverentially, before him, pale as death—his brown hair saturated with sweat, and frozen upon his white forehead; his large, deep blue eyes fainting not, nor fading, in the awful presence. He replied. `I refused to give up my sword to any body but the commander-in-chief.' Washington raised his head; a slight movement of his nether lip, seemed to betray an inward agitation, as slight; but he merely stretched out his hand in silence; and Archibald obeyed it, by unbelting his sword, with a resolute hand, and laying it, respectfully, upon the table. Washington then turned, and made a motion to a fine spirited looking officer (Colonel Reid,) which he obeyed, by leaving the room. A deep silence, of some minutes, followed; during which, the commander's steady look was never taken from the sword, except to glance, for a moment, at my brother, who stood, rather haughtily, I thought, after he had given it up; and then at me. `You are brothers, I believe?' continued Washington. `Yes, Sir,' said Archibald. `You knew that duelling was prohibited in the army?' `Yes, Sir.' There was another silence of some moments, in which I could see the lip of Washington writhe again, and his broad forehead darken with thought; yet it was but just visible, like the emotion of one, that, great as he is, cannot, when his bones and blood are jarred, cannot forbear showing it, in the calm of his eye, or the hue of his lip. `Am I to believe that the death was accidental?' `No, Sir—I slew him, deliberately,' said Archibald. `What!' answered the general, raising his arm in wrath, and then letting it fall upon the table, before him, as if his great nature had rebuked him; and then he continued in a deep, tranquilized tone, to speak, as follows: `I have been assured, that the affair was an accident —that several gentlemen, had assembled for fencing— that, by some accident, Col. Clinton was slain. Yet, it was intimated to me, that there had been a growing hostility between you for some time. It was for that reason, that I have ordered your arrest. It is no light matter, young man, to have put in jeopardy, the lives of eight men—eight officers. But my duty is a plain one. The law shall be enforced. Is it not enough, that we have the enemy upon us, from without; but we must be murdering each other in cold blood! He was evidently very much disturbed; either, at the thought of putting seven young men on trial for their lives, before a court-martial; or at the death of Clinton, who had long been a member of his family. `I did hope,' continued Washington, with a temperate fervency of manner, that brought tears into Archibald's eyes; `that this would prove, what it has been represented to me—a hasty, accidental affair; and that a young man of such promise, would not have been the first, to set that discipline at naught, which he has been so long conspicuous in the support of.' `May I be permitted,' said Archibald, faltering a little in his voice, less, it was evident, from any terrour of punishment, than the fear of having offended his commander, `to —' Washington signified to him to proceed—and he continued, standing before him, with his arms folded, and his slight frame shaking with emotion, till he had told the tale as it was; and till the face of Washington altered— first to compassion, then to sorrow, then to admiration. I do not mean to say, that he told the cause of the quarrel; but the whole of the quarrel, which ended so fatally, he did tell, modestly, but manfully, till Washington himself changed colour—and then, turning slowly to us both, said: `I shall enquire into this. In the mean time, you will remain under arrest—but not in confinement.' We bowed, for the motion of his hand was not to be misunderstood, or resisted; and withdrew—just as Colonel Reid was returning. He stopped, as we passed him—wiped a tear from his eyes, and gave his hand to Archibald; `poor Clinton,' said he. `Poor Clinton,' said Archibald, from his heart; and we passed on. The whole encampment was in an uproar; soldiers and officers were crowding about us, at every step, —some with menacing—others with compassionate looks, for Clinton was an universal favourite with the southern men, and universally execrated by the northern ones; nay, so far had things gone at times, that a mischievous spirit might have made a drawn battle of it, more than once, by a little meddling. `Dear brother,' said I, seeing him stop, and put his hands to his head, as if in extreme pain, after we had passed the crowd, `you look wretchedly—are you wounded?' `I feel so,' said he—`put your hand here'—I gave it to him, and he laid it on his temples—they beat furiously—but, as he moved his neck under the pressure, I observed that his bosom was full of blood. I was terrified at the quantity—it was coagulated, and I could have taken it out by handfulls. I hurried him to the tent, and found that, at every movement of his head, it gushed out again, like a little spout; but the surgeon who examined it, put me out of all apprehension immediately, as to the wound. `That is nothing,' he said, with emphasis; `but — God bless me, what a fever he is in!' He was in a fever—and, for two weeks, I never left his bed side; but at last, I had the happiness to see him on the saddle again—paler, a little, than usual— weaker, but not sadder, for that were impossible. `There is your sword,' said an officer, entering one day after dinner, and handing a sabre to Archibald; `the commander bids you use it, hereafter, not against your friends, nor his friends, but the enemies of your country.' Archibald bowed, and, the moment that the officer had left the room, threw the weapon from him, saying: `Brother! I have half a mind never to buckle it on again.' `Why?' said I, in surprise. `I am weary of the trade of blood—it wears me to death.' `Archibald!' said I, `hear me; we have gone too far now, to retreat—we have sinned, and have been dishonoured. Let us first atone for our transgressions— recover our name—and then! there is my hand—go where you will, when you will, I will follow you.' `How atone for them?' said he, `how recover our name? By spilling more blood! fighting more battles! killing more human creatures! Brother, I am not very sure—not so sure, as I have been, that this war is a righteous one.' `For shame Archibald,' I cried, `for shame! would you have your children slaves!' `God can make them free,' he replied—`and they were better and happier, as slaves—than if their freedom—that princeless heritage, were bought with blood.' `But God will not, cannot be hoped to work miracles for us—we must labour?' `God hath said—thou shalt not kill; we dare to say thou shalt kill? God hath bowed the heavens, and come down to us, and taught us that we are one great brotherhood—yet man, presumptuous man— hath dared to set his majesty at nought, trample on his law, and make the nations of the earth murderers. No! I must think of this. What I do, shall be done, not rashly, not unadvisedly—but temperately. There's much blood upon my hands—too much, it may be, for me ever to sleep quietly again—but all of it, all! that I have hitherto shed—nay, not even my own—is so loathsome and sickening, so terrible and blinding, as that of poor Clinton; yet—yet!—as I am a living man—brother, were it to do over again, I would do precisely what I have done, though I went to hell for it—.' I shuddered from head to foot—`brother,' said I— `what devil possesses you! You have been, at intervals, since that affair, frightfully blasphemous—yet you used to be somewhat solemn of thought, at times, and humble—and would pray, now and then; but since Clinton's death—.' `I cannot pray—I cannot,' he said, turning abruptly away from me, `I dare not.' `But, whatever be your resolution,' said I, `you will not think of abandoning the army, while it is in danger.' `What danger?' `Sir William Howe has taken the field—left New York; put all his troops in motion, and we are hourly expecting an attack. Lord Sterling has just been sent out. La Fayette—and, if the enemy does not attack us, we shall have the finest opportunity in the world, for distinguishing ourselves; for, his line of march, encumbered as it is with baggage for an army of eighty or a hundred thousand men, we are told, reaches nearly twelve miles along the road.' His eye flashed fire. `The sooner the better,' he cried, `I only want to hear the stirrups ringing again, the trumpets blowing, and I shall be happy, happy! alas poor Clinton!—to die may be very terrible— to die so suddenly, is so—but to survive—Oh! that is to suffer. Every thing that I touch feels of blood.— Every thing that I see, or smell—looks and smells of blood, detestable hot blood—foaming and smoking from the ground—Ha! was that lightning!' `No,' said I, `hark!—it is one of the cannon at the north—ah! that's the report.' `By heaven,' he exclaimed, putting his hand before his eyes, `I have become the veriest coward that breathes. Strange delusions are upon me. I thought just then, that I was upon the Delaware again—that I saw a horse, drowning, in the black water—the body of Clinton, entangled in the trapping. I was just on the point of leaping in, when the thunder broke about my heart; and the blue lightning flashed like a serpent of fire, hissing, through the water—are you sure that it was a cannon?' `Certainly,' I replied—`I'll lead to you the very gun in five minutes.' `And this! (striking the snow with his foot,) this is the solid earth? You would persuade me of that, I suppose; why, John, I can feel it heave under my tread like the ocean—no! like graves about to give up their dead—and, when I strike my foot upon it thus,—hark! do you not hear a moaning? a jarring too, as if you leaned against a great organ, while it was in full play?' `You distress me, exceedingly, dear Archibald,' said I, `rouse yourself. These humours will be the death of you, yet.' `The sooner the better, brother.' `That is impious,' I replied. `You are young— full of high thought, and—.' `Weltering in human blood—go on—.' `And fitted,' said I, `for much blessing to mankind.' `Rouse yourself—tear away the grave clothes that are about you, and come forth!' `Come forth! come forth! speak to Clinton, brother. Bid him come forth; bid him come forth from the holes of the rock, the charnel house; and I, by heaven! I will take his place joyfully—you weep! Brother it is unmanly to weep. Unmanly of you—yet I, I, would give the world to weep, but I cannot; there is nothing but molten lead, at my heart, no tears, none; they are all dried up; the fountain is full of dust and reptiles.' `A fierce and wayward spirit, brother,' said I, deeply affected by his manner. `A wayward spirit, brother—not a fierce one;—a melancholy spirit, weary of slaughter, bowed down— not by calamity, not by peril, not by sickness, but by doubt and sorrow. That sky—look up, brother—so blue and beautiful, sweeping darkly above us, with a swiftness of motion—so uninterrupted and eternal— that we mistake it for an immoveable vault—so swift! that we mistake motion for solidity! Brother I never look up to that sky, when the stars are in it, but, there comes, rushing over me, a flood of brightness and disorder—I hear the neighing of horses, the clashing of armed men; the breaking of water about me, and under me—and all the earth in commotion—wind and fire—while that serene and beautiful dome above, thickly beleagued with God's bright Cherubim, rolls forever above us, undisturbed, unmoved, in its sweet and awful repose. `At this moment brother, dark as it is—I can see a troop of horsemen, racing like a disorderly rabble, over the white snow; and wheeling and galloping in the moonlight—I can see their faces, count them, one by one; distinguish all their horses; see the dark eyes of Arthur, streaming with fire—hear my own voice in the wind—all this, with my ears stopped, and my eyes shut, as plainly as I saw it, and heard it all, the night before that inroad of murderers, upon our house; the night before!—no, the very night—brother!— O brother—could we but have met them!—and now—ah! a storm.' `No, dear Archibald—no, it is is only the noise of distant cannon—surely you can see as well as I!' `No, I fear not—I am blind and dizzy, shattered, I fear—let me lean upon your arm—dark shadows are about me, unpleasant faces— they jar my blood,— and—Ha! there! that splash of the water! O, it was precisely the same that sounded on my ears, when the mare leaped out of the boat.' `It was not water, brother—it was the broad striped flag there, flapping in the wind.' `We were just under it—it was the red and blue flag, striped and stained—and that was the first day of its floating.' `Where,' said he—`it is very dark—there was a beautiful starlight, when I came out.' I stopped. There was something in his manner, more than in his words, that frightened me; for lie leaned upon me, with his whole weight, like a sick man. `I see no stars,' said he—`let us go back, I know not where I am. The ground is unsteady, and I expect it to fall in, at every step. And while I hear a continual hum of voices, rattling of armour—a flapping, like many eagles above me—yet I can hardly persuade myself that we are not upon the Delaware again: it is a strange phantasy; but I can hear the quick sound of the rifles along the bank—and almost distinguish the horses that dash, hither and thither, as they did, on the night of our first embarkation—and there too is the same cold, troubled moonlight, away at the north east, gushing over the barrier of black clouds, like a white torrent, bursting in the wind—and now!—by heaven! brother, you are weaker than I—how you tremble?—does it snow?—I can feel it driving in my face—or rain?—or—what! are you weeping—Stop! speak to me—am I awake! or not?—Are we going on; —speak!—are we upon the water?—or the land?— going, or coming from Trenton—?' VOL. II. 3 I was utterly overcome—unable to articulate a word. And it was only when I had led him back to our quarters, and sent for our good physician, that I was able to step without reeling. The doctor looked alarmed—but attributed the sudden blindness of Archibald, to a quick rush of blood into the brain, after sitting in a recumbent posture for a long time; yet, with all our care, it was some days before we were able to repeat the experiment of leading him into the open air. But when we did—he took a new and firmer aspect. And when Arthur returned, (for he had been absent several days, on a visit to Mary) he was able to mount his horse, and accompany us in our little scouting parties. At last, however, the signal was given. Our tents were struck. Our log huts demolished—and our whole army put in motion. At the first sign of preparation, the noble fellow started up, as from a trance,—leaped into the saddle, and dashed away to the head of his men, with all that high, heroick expression of earnestness, which used to characterise him. `Now John,' said he, plucking out his sword— `now! for something better than complaint!' Yet, though we were constantly under arms, marching and countermarching, it was not until the nineteenth of June, that we were able to make any calculation from the capricious movement of Sir William Howe. At first, we thought that he would cross the Delaware, and pour into our entrenchment, man and horse, without giving us time to breathe; but, we soon found that he had left all his boats, and bridges, and heavy baggage at Brunswick, and come, after a rapid march, unparalleled indeed for him—all at once, to a—full stop. Washington, himself, we could perceive, was confoundedly puzzled; but, neither alarmed nor intimidated by these contradictory operations of his antagonist; and finally, when that antagonist had, after having thrown up a chain of redoubts, extending from Somerset to Brunswick---suddenly abandoned them, as soon as they were completed---retreating to Brunswick---and thence to Amboy, without striking a blow---except at the churches, court houses, and other buildings upon the road---which he left, reddening and smoking with devastation, our perplexity was increased to a distressing degree. We were willing to fight, anxious to fight---but few men could have borne, as we did, the uninterrupted tension of their faculties, for such a length of time, as we did---bodily and mental, during the period of indecision. All felt it, but no man more than Archibald;---his sinews were strung to snapping, again and again during the day. Again and again, would the drum roll `at dead of night'---and we would hear the trumpet ringing over our faces, as we lay, each man by his own horse---while the trooper that blew it, galloped along the darkly mustering battalions— we would leap into our saddles---form, and await the signal of battle, in the expectation that the enemy were upon us---a few vollies would roll over the clouded sky ---a distant drum or two, rattle for a moment--a solitary cannon peal like an earthequake, along the trembling ground—and we would be ordered to our repose again. To Archibald, more than to any of us, this trial was terrible!—naturally impatient, he was—(chiefly, I believe, that the uproar might drown certain recollections of Clinton)—unspeakably so, about this time. And, at last, when General Greene had been advanced, to fall upon the enemy's rear,—and Wayne and Morgan, upon their flanks; with Washington, and the whole main body to support them—Archibald could be restrained no longer;—and, just at day light, when Morgan's infantry attacked the Hessian pickets, and drove them in, he rode suddenly down upon them, at the head of his troop, without waiting for orders—heedless, it would seem, of every thing but employment; for, such was the disorderly nature of his attack, that, but for Morgan, who, for a moment, mistook him for an enemy, and suddenly called in his men, to receive him, he would probably have been sacrificed for his impetuosity. I heard Morgan speak of it, afterward. `Damn the young mad-cap,' said he, in his broad, fearless way— `I had brought my men off, and was just ready to give him a volley, that would have left half his troop upon the field—when he came round upon the enemy in such a style, that it took my breath away—broke in upon them—cutting and slashing, like so many devils—and would have been shut up, but for a company of my boys that poured in a round or two upon some infantry, who were rallying to support the picket.' Morgan, literally, rained fire upon the enemy that day;—and so hot and fierce was the tempest, that they crossed the bridge (at Brunswick) and threw themselves into redoubts on the eastern side of the river; and then, without waiting our approach, abandoned them, and hurried, with unspeakable precipitation, along the Amboy road. What possessed Sir William Howe to cut so many flourishes, before a handful of men, and afterward to retreat so precipitately, without coming to action—has always been a question with military men. The uncharitable have attributed it to every thing but a want of courage; but I—I am not uncharitable to a brave man—nor unkind to the memory of an honorable one. My notion is that he overrated our strength—and what wonder? our own countryman did so, at least five hundred per cent!—that he had been electrified by some recent operations of Washington, when, he was literally alone, standing up, amid the war of darkness and ice that thundered upon America—deserted, doubted, and alone. This had taught Sir William a wonderful degree of wisdom and circumspection. Our army now moved to Quibbletown; and Howe passed over a part of his troops, and his heavy baggage to Staten Island, evidently with the hope of perplexing us still more. But Washington was too many for him; he drew in his light parties, and kept possession of the high grounds, determining not to avoid a battle, if it were offered—on such terms as would do—nor to invite one, unless at some manifest advantage of position, that should counterbalance the difference in number. Yet, nothing effectual could be done. Lord Sterling, it was true, had a scuffle with the enemy, for two or three hours, in which he manifested infinitely more courage than generalship—more rashness, I should say. His lordship was a brave man—but—(and a bitterer thing could not be said of a soldier, though we have chosen to take it as a compliment, in the late war)—he did not know when he was beaten—nay, nor when he was in mortal peril:—Some changes in the northern army had taken place about this time; the long pending dispute, between General Gates and Schuyler, was brought to a precipitate and foolish termination by the block-heads in Congress, who turned, first one, and then the other out of command, neck and heels, without trial or examination. And Howe finally passed over to Staten Island, leaving us in possession of the Jerseys again—with nothing to do, but to listen to frightful stories of Burgoyne, who, it was believed, had already begun to pour in his legions upon us, like an inundation, from the north. I remember my own feelings; and love to recall the bright eye and clouded aspect of Archibald at this time, who was, really—I believe it in my soul—the only man within our entrenchments, whose heart did not stop sometimes,—when the tale of Burgoyne and his army of veterans, his world of artillery—his own reputation—and the hordes of Indian marksmen that followed his camp—came to our ears. But we were becalmed. We had no power to get up, and stir our limbs. The enemy stood aloof from us; and we had the mortification to lie, like chained giants, ironed ancle and wrist, upon our beds; and hear clap, after clap, from the North and East—the capture of Prescott—the retreat of St. Clair—the affair of General Herkimer, and Staten Island—the valiant conduct of Arnold—and, finally, one report, that shook us to the dust, and jarred the whole country, the battle of Bennington, where farmer Stark, served VOL. II. 3* the enemy, hour after hour, with bayonet and ball; and brought them down, at last, a thousand men of war prisoners and dead, to the sturdy yeomanry of the north. I remembered the noise in our camp, when the news came, as if it were but yesterday. There was a great outcry and tumult. Archibald leaped upon his feet, struck his hands together, with a loud shout;—and then, the tears gushed out of his eyes—and he shook from head to foot, with shame and vexation. One only thing found we to relieve us.* * A young fiery Pole, had got a footing in our army—and (it was the count Pulaski,) Washington had permitted him to form a body of light horse,—from that hour Archibald and he were inseparable. Pulaski was decidedly the best horseman, and the most daring, beyond all comparison, that I ever saw; and, after awhile, he seemed to attach himself to Archibald, with a feeling more like the passion of brotherhood, than that of common friendship. Every day, I could perceive the advantage of it. Every day, were we taught some evolution that was knew—or corrected in some mistaken practice of our own;—indeed, at last, the Count was pleased to say, I heard him as he sheathed his sword, after manœuvering us for a whole afternoon—that he would put his legion now, man for man, against any upon this earth. Archibald's mare stood upright, at the sound—but not of her own accord, I imagine, for her flanks were reeking, dismally, when she passed me, a moment afterward. Again we were put upon the march. For nearly a month, by continual and contradictory evolutions of Sir William's army, and the fleet of Lord Howe—we were kept in a state of perpetual anxiety and doubt, not knowing whether the enemy meant to strike at the north or south; one was as probable as the other; and we, unluckily, had no army of observation, but our main body, which we dared not move, a day's march from the centre, between what we believed to be the points of attack, meditated by the enemy; lest, the moment that we had turned to the right, he should dash to the left; or, if we turned to the left, for the choice was always in his power, as it generally is, with the assailant, he should face suddenly about, and play the devil with our right. Yet, for a whole month, from the 23d of July, to the 22d of August, this state of suspense and trial continued—altogether more painful and discouraging, I am sure, not only to the army, but to Washington himself, than any time of the sam duration during the war. But, at length, we were done with feints and manœuvres—and were put, seriously, upon the march for Philadelphia; for intelligence that could be depended upon, had arrived. The enemy were in the Chesapeake.— We were about eleven thousand strong, then; and, at last, on the 10th of September, we took possession of a commanding ground on the east side of the Brandywine—our main body at Chadsford, with General Maxwell, occupying a hill on the opposite side, on which he entrenched himself, tolerably, the same night. `Now,' said Pulaski—riding up to Archibald, and saluting him with a motion of his keen weapon, that looked very like a play of fire work, for a moment, `now! my brave friend, we shall have an opportunity to try your metal—horse and blade.' `And temper?' said Archibald—whistling the sword, in a circle of light (that one of the men swore was to be seen there, after he rode off,) about his head. La Fayette was riding slowly by, at the moment, and smiling, with that expression of calm benignity which made him the favourite of the whole army, reined up, and exchanged a few words in French, (which I did not well understand, then,) with Pulaski, whose eye flashed fire, as he exclaimed, in downwright English. `Aye! by the virgin, as brave a heart as ever beat! He only wants age,' (glancing at Archibald.) We were soon after abreast of each other. `A battle, is at hand now,' said I, `brother what are your feelings?' `Calm, unutterably calm.' `Do you ever think of home now? You have done speaking of it.' `You,' he smiled, `you have a round about way asking a question. But I understand you; yes, I do think of home, my only home, night and day.' `I am glad of it,' said I, cheerfully. `We seemed by a common consent to have abandoned all conversation, and even all allusion to it.' `You do not understand me,' he said, `I do not speak of our mother—God be merciful to her! nor of Mrs. Arnauld, Mr. Arnauld, Mary Austin, Clara, your Clara; what! a blush, a thrill! well brother, if we pass through this trial, a way must be found to make her acquainted with this; I thought that you had forgotten her.' `No,' said I, resolutely, `no! if we ever meet again, it must be by accident. I will have no interference.' `Nor I,' he replied, `and henceforth, when you mean to ask me, if I have forgotten Lucia Arnauld, do not put your question in the shape of `Do you ever think of home now?' Be frank with me, and I will with you. Artifice defeats itself. I hurt you; but it is well that I should. You will be the better for it.— Deal plainly with me, like a soldier, like a man, John, and I will conceal no thought of my heart from you. Would you have me believe that you are a wily, love sick fellow, toiling to win another into some talk of her that you love, without the manhood to speak boldly about her? For shame brother! You love her; and you pay her a poor compliment, if you deal thus with her. No, speak out, speak boldly, however she may have treated you; and, whatever happen, she will be proud of you, and that is better than her love.'</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER II. `Ah, few shall part, where many meet; `Their blood shall be their winding sheet, `And every turf, beneath theirfeet `Shall be a soldier's sepulchre.' The battle of Brandywine was fought on the eleventh, of September 1777; and lasted all the day long. It was a bloody affair to us; and had well nigh been fatal to Greene and Sullivan. We had been in the saddle about four hours, under the intrepid Pulaski, who, with his own hand, examined our points, pistols and furniture, as if assured that the struggle would be a deadly, and long continued one. The day—by heaven! it was one of the most beautiful that ever broke over the earth.* * For a whole hour before, the sky was all in commotion. From the north to the ease, a soft troubled gleaming here and there with incessant flashes, appeared a vast shadowy, broken and disordered moveas if the Heavens were in travail; and all the elements of creation were separating into shape and loveliness, and some new planets were about to roll out, with a rush of brightness and verdure, from the disquieted east. We were about half a mile from the main body, ranged along a green slope, facing the west; our horses, in number about four hundred, standing as patiently as so many marble creatures—until, just as the eastern sky began to redden and undulate; and cloud after cloud, to roll up, and heave, like a great curtain, upon the wind; and the whole heaven seemed discharging all its beauty and brightness upon one spot—I happened to turn about and saw the tall Pole, bareheaded, tilting his horse, like some warlike presence—come up out of the solid earth, to worship upon the very summit of the hil! behind us; it might be, for the noble carriage of the man—the martial bearing of the soldier, would permit either interpretation; it might be, in the awful employment of devotion—or—in the more earthward one, of martial observation. But, suddenly, he reined up his charger, shook the heavy dew from his horseman's cap—replaced it, and leaped, headlong, down the hill, just as a bright flash passed away on the horizon, followed by a loud report; and, the next moment, a part of our ranks were covered with dust and turf, thrown up by a cannon-ball that struck within a hundred yards of the place that he had just left. Our horses pricked up their ears at the sound; and, all at once, as if a hundred trumpets were playing in the wind, came the noise of the enemy in his advance. Pulaski unsheathed his sword—called out a select body, and set off at a full gallop to a more distant elevation, where we saw the enemy advancing in two columns; one, under Knyphausen, which moved in tremendous steadiness, like a dark, solid mass, in a direction toward Maxwell; the other, under Cornwallis, which seemed to threaten the right flank of our main body. Intelligence was immediately sent to Washington, and reinforcements called in, from the horse that we had left. We kept our position, awaiting, for a whole hour, the sound of conflict: at last, a heavy volley rattled along the sky—a few moments passed, and then another followed, like a storm of iron upon drum-heads. The whole air rung with it; another, and another followed, and then, gradually increasing in loudness, and loudness, came peal after peal upon us, till it resembled one continual clap of thunder, rolling about under an illuminated vapour. Archibald could not sit still—and his mare seemed possessed with a devil; in her effort to rush toward the quarter, where the white, fiery, transparent smoke evolved, and eddied, like that of a furnace, in a high wind—with one uninterrupted reverberation, she struggled and snorted, and plunged, till the clear bright blood ran out of her nostrils, and frothed and foamed about her lips: there was rebellion in her very eyes. But Pulaski, with all his impetuosity, was a general; and knew his duty too well, to hazard any movement, till he should be able to see with certainty, the operation of the enemy in the vapour below. Meanwhile, several little parties that we had sent out, came in, one after the other, in full gallop, with the intelligence, that Knyphausen had broken down upon Maxwell in magnificent style—been beaten back, again and again; but, that he had finally prevailed, and that Maxwell had retreated across the river. A thin vapour now rose from the green earth below us, and completely covered the enemy from our view. It was no longer possible to follow him, except by the sound of his tread, which we could feel in the solid earth, jarring ourselves and our horses; and now and then, a quick glimmering in the mist, as some standard was raised above it—some weapon flourished, or some musket shot through it—like a rocket. About an hour after, a horseman dashed through the smoke, on the very verge of the horizon—and after scouring the fields for a whole mile, within view, communicated with two or three others, who set off in different directions—one to us, with orders to hurry down to the ford, where the commander-in-chief was determined to fall upon Knyphausen with all his power, before Cornwallis could come to his aid. It was a noble but hazardous game. And Pulaski, whose war-horse, literally thundered and lightened along the broken and stony precipice, by which we descended, kept his eyes warily to the right, as if not quite certain, that the order would not be countermanded. We soon fell in with Greene, who was posting, all on fire, to give Knyphausen battle; and, the next moment, saw Sullivan in full march, over a distant hill, (upon which, the morning sun broke out just then, as if leaving the heavens for a while,) to turn the enemy's flank. This arrangement would have been fatal to Knyphausen; but, unluckily there was a stop put to it, almost in the very moment, when we were ready to fall upon him, man and horse, by the alarming intelligenee, that Cornwallis had moved off to another quarter. There was a moment of irresolution—doubt. It was the death of us. Greene was recalled; and Sullivan commanded to halt. Hardly had this happened, and our horses were covered with sweat and froth—fretting like chained tigers upon the bit; our men, covered with dust, and blinded with the wind, and sun—for it was extremely hot and sultry—when a heavy cannonade was heard on our right flank; and Greene, whose division we had been attached to, was put in motion for the support of Sullivan, whom we had left some hours before. The truth now broke upon us like a thunder clap. The enemy had passed, concentrated, (as we supposed,) and fallen upon our right. Lord! I never shall forget Greene's countenance, when the news came; he was in the road side, upon a very steep bank—but he wheeled where he was—dashed down the bank—his face white as the bleached marble—and calling to us, to gallop forward for encouragement, without throwing ourselves into the enemy's power, put his division forward, with such a tremendous impulse, that they marched four miles in forty minutes: we held on our way, in a cloud of dust, and met Sullivan, all in disorder, nearly a mile from the field, retreating, step by step, at the head of his men, and shouting himself hoarse—covered with blood and sweat; and striving, in vain, to bring them to a stand—while Cornwallis was pouring in upon them, an incessant volley. Pulaski dashed out to the right, over the broken fences; and there stood awhile, upright in his stirrups, reconnoitering—while the enemy who appeared by the smoke and dust that rolled before them, in the wind, to be much nearer than they really were, redoubled their efforts: but, at last, he saw a favourable opportunity. The column wheeled—the wind swept athwart their van, revealing them, like a batallion of spirits, breathing fire and smoke: he gave the signal—Archibald repeated it—Arthur—and myself. In three minutes, we were ready for the word; and, when Pulaski, shouting in a voice that thrilled through and through us, struck spurs to his charger—it was half a minute—so fierce and terrible was his charge, before we were able to come up with him. What could he mean! gracious heaven! my hand, convulsively, like that of a drowning man, reined up for a moment—when I saw that we were galloping straight forward, into a field of bayonets —yet he was the first man! and who would not have followed him! We did follow him, and with such a hurricane of fire and steel, that, when we wheeled, our whole path lay broad and open before us, with a wall of fire upon the right hand and the left but not a bayonet nor a blade in front, except what were under the hoofs of our horses. My blood rushes now, like a flash of fire, through my forehead, when I recal the devastation that we had made—almost to the very heart of the enemy's column. But Pulaski—he, who afterward rode into their entrenchments, on horseback, sword in hand, was accustomed to it; and, having broken over them once—aware of his peril, if he should give them time to awake from their consternation, he wheeled in a blaze of fire, with the intention of returning, through a wall of death, more perilous than that which shut in the children of Israel, upon the red sea—but no! the walls had rolled in upon us, and we were left no choice, but to continue as we had began. The undaunted Pole rioted in the excess of his joy; I remember how he passed me, again and again, recking with blood—riding, absolutely, upon the very bayonets of the enemy; and, at last, as they pressed upon him—and horseman after horseman, fell from our saddles—when we were all faint and feeble, and even Archibald was fighting on foot, over his beautiful mare, with Arthur battling over his head, we heard the joyful cry of succour! succour! and felt the enemy give way—heave, this way VOL. II. 4 and that, and finally concentrate, beyond us: `Once more!' cried Pulaski, `once more!' and away he went again, breaking in upon them, as they were forming; and trampling down whole platoons, in the charge, before a man could plant his bayonet, or bring his piece to an aim: and, the next moment, we were scouring over the ground, where I could yet see Archibald and Arthur battling it, with four or five of the enemy's horse; but our aspect, as we came thundering round upon them, proved sufficient. They took to their heels, and we brought them both off, unwounded—unhurt. It was getting dark now, but the hour was that of sunset; when, in this climate, the sky is like a mass of coloured vapour floating over a bath. Greene was forming in our rear, with that fearful calmness, which boded a terrible time, always, to him that ventured upon it. The ground was favourable to him; and the half hour that the enemy lost by our charge, a mere handful, into his solid column, was of inconcievable benefit to Greene; for his men were literally out of breath, and ready to drop down, at the first onset. But, that half hour gave them an opportunity to see their commander's face, and hear his voice; and, from that moment, they would have stood their ground, though the heavens had rained fire upon them I have been in many a battle—many a one, that made my hair stiffen afterward in my sleep, when I dreamt of it—but never in one, where the carnage was so dreadful—the rush of blood and fire so incessant, as that which followed the arrival of Greene: we were unable to strike a blow. The enemy imagining us, no doubt, to he much more formidable than we were, had hedged in all his exposed points, by a rank of men, kneeling with planted bayonets; and, though we rode upon them, again and again, discharging our pistols in their faces—yet not one of them shut his eyes, or fired a shot—but, where he knelt, he died; and his place was immediately filled by another, as resolute, so that we could not, the thing was impossible, repeat the blow that we had given. But one thing happened, within my own sight and hearing, that nearly brought me to the ground, in terrour and helplessness. Two horsemen had set upon me; and, while I was doing my best to return their visit. I saw that they were only a part of a squadron, whom we had not seen before, or who had but just been brought into action; and that several were upon Archibald, who, while I was looking upon him, recled in the saddle, and took a blow, I thought, that cleft his head —for his bear-skin cap flew, and his horse broke from the encounter, and dashed off to the right; I followed, and soon came in contact with Weedon's Virginia brigade, which soon relieved me from all apprehensions on my own account; for the enemy fell before them, rank after rank, like flax in the blaze; they were supported by a body of the Pennsylvania militia, near the head of whom, I saw La Fayette; the reins all loose— wounded in the arm—his red scarf shot away, and streaming in the wind—yet showing the same unaltered front; and leading the raw militia up to the very eyes of the enemy, while a sheet of fire scorched their faces. I continued my course, and soon discovered a horseman staggering in the darkness—whom, I knew, from the shape and bearing, to be Archibald, long and long before I could get to him. It was he—and he was faint, very faint, from the loss of blood—I—I spoke to him, and was reaching out my hand to catch the rein of his unmanageable horse, when the animal stumbled—rolled over—snorted, so as to cover me with a shower of blood, and died. Archibald fell with her; and for some minutes, I stood over him, utterly unable to hear if he answered me, or not; such was the terrible noise from the place of contention—so deafening—so blinding; and such, the low, deep, inarticulate sobbing of my poor brother: at last, however, O, how unspeakably dear was the first sound of his voice! at last he spoke. `Arthur?—John?' `Yes, brother,' said I. We were sitting upon a wet bank—and it was quite dark. `Brother, is it you? I would give the world for a drop of cool water.' I left him, and ran about for a long time, before I was able to find any—and, after all, was only able to bring him a small quantity in my leather cap—that I dare say, had been trampled into, and bled into, by dying horses and men that day. `God bless you!' he cried—drinking it every drop, before he returned the cap—and, without stopping to breathe. `Ha! the cannon still! will they fight forever? Let us go back.' `What! are you able to go back?' `Able!' he cried—leaping upon his feet—`able! aye, and will—though a whole regiment of horse had been shot under me. I—I—' He staggered, and fell athwart the trodden turf; and lay for some minutes, without speaking; so long indeed, that the firing had ceased—and we heard the two armies moving away. Heard, I say—but I mean that we felt them; for, inconceivable as it may seem, to those who have had no experience, it is true, that the tread of a battalion, heavily armed, may be felt many miles by a person lying upon level ground in a serene day. The Indians know this, and profit by it. But the battle was now over; and we were at last discovered by a party of our own troop, who, ignorant of their loss, were scouring the open country, to protect the wounded, and cut off the stragglers. We then crossed the river, and moved up toward Sweeds ford; while Sir William Howe, who seemed to be satisfied, whenever he had fought us, without being beaten, and was never prepared to follow up any advantage, halted three days upon the field of battle, to contemplate the havock that had been made; while our cause was never in greater danger. We had lost nearly twelve hundred men, and ten brass field pieces. Arehibald had been sorely bruised, and fatigued beyond all example, in the strife; but, in no other way was he materially injured. Again we were upon the river—Archibald and I, sitting together; and he, poor fellow, lamenting the loss of his mare, as if she had been his wife: by this. I mean, not, that he whistled and sang—but, that he wept —aye, wept, for the loss of the noble beast, and believed, I am sure, to his dying day, that she died of a broken heart. `Would that I had let her have her own way!' he said. While we were ruminating on the event and I was; watching his full eyes, and almost mocking at his grief—we heard a loud cry, and a plunge; we turned, and saw Du Coudray, whom we instantly knew, by his beautiful uniform, in the middle of the current, upon the back of his furious horse: unluckily, in the animal's terrour, he had entangled his feet in the reins, so as to keep his mouth and nose under. The gallant Frenchman lost not his presence of mind, for a moment, but threw himself from the saddle—while the fiery horse was beating the dark water all into foam about him, and attemped to gain the shore. In vain, in vain —he fainted—struck, as we always thought it probable, by the hoofs of his horse; he gasped a moment— made two or three desperate plunges—sobbed—the water rushed into his throat, and he gradually sunk, till nothing but his beautiful hair was seen floating upon the wave, and the motion of his hands, blindly toiling under the water for a moment longer. Many an arm was near him—many a voice—he heard them—tried to reach them; put his hands out of the water for a little distance—the fingers wide apart, and went down then forever! Poor fellow! Archibald was near to him—but not the nearest—and, when he went down, he uttered a loud cry, threw himself half out of water, and sunk. Archibald plunged after him—but it was too late—Du Coudray had been swept away. Again were we on the point of battle. It was the 17th of Sept. We were on the Lancaster road—near the Warren tavern. Archibald was just able to sit his VOL. II. 4* horse, and felt particularly solicitous to do his duty again; for Washington had been pleased to speak to him, face to face, for his good conduct; and he was now to battle under Washington's eyes. Our van was already engaged; and Pulaski, all on fire, for another dash at the enemy, was beginning to shew the usual symptoms of onset, when, all at once, the windows of heaven were opened; and the rain poured down in such torrents that both armies drew off—ours with every cartridge that they had, spoilt,—theirs, to march on to Philadelphia, of which they took possession immediately. And here an affair took place, in which Arthur was personally concerned. He had been detailed, with about twenty of our troop, to the aid of Captain Lee's dragoons, for the purpose of destroying some flour. Colonel Hamilton was with us. We had succeeded in our purpose—and were about returning; when our videttes, that we had left out, came down upon us, at full speed, with the enemy at their heels. I was near Hamilton, who immediately ordered us into a flat bottomed boat, leaping his own horse in at the same time. I obeyed; and, as we put off, under several successive vollies from the enemy, poured into us like hail from the bank and bridge above us—I saw Lee and Arthur. They faced suddenly with one other dragoon in the rear—upon the advancing column, and dashed athwart the bridge, in their very faces, under a general discharge. Over they went—with the fire streaming from the heels of their horses---and all eyes upon them---I, for one, holding my breath---and expecting to see their bodies fall off, at the first turn of the horses. But no---not a bullet struck them. It seemed miraculous---yet so it was. And when I had hold of Arthur's hand, a few moments afterward, and saw his unaltered countenance, and handsome eyes bright with his deliverance---I could scarcely believe my own senses---nay---scarcely refrain from tears. `The enemy are in Philadelphia,' said I. `No, not yet'—he replied; `but on their way there. What mean you?'. `I mean,' said I, `that—that—are you entirely at ease about Mary?' `Perfectly,' said he, smiling. `Do you know where she is?' `In Philadelphia—is she not?' He shook his head. `No,' said he—`no, I thank you. She is in better quarters.' `By heaven—Arthur—it is'nt possible; that young man with you—can it be, that he.' A young, handsome fellow, had lately joined Arthur; and, for a moment, I was childish enough to think— what I am ashamed to utter. He understood me— coloured, and frowned. `No,' he exclaimed—`no! I do not ask you what you thought. I should not like to hear it. But Mary is safe—at Mr. Arnauld's. Ha!—you are strangely disturbed. Mark me, they are all well, very well—all except Clara, and Lucia. They have heard of Clinton's death.'</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER III. `Through tangled juniper, beds of weeds; `Through many a fen, where the serpent feeds, And man ne'er trod before. `And near him the she wolf stirred the brake, `And the copper-snake breathed in his ear.' In hurrying rapidly over the events of this period, which related to the operations of the army, I have omitted to mention an incident, which, at the time, made little impression upon us, (Archibald and myself I mean), but which, from the consequences that afterward grew out of it, became exceedingly important. I have alluded already to the jealousies and heart burning, between the eastern and southern troops; and, it is a fact, not now to be denied, that the New Englanders, with a few exceptions, were the most substantial men for the service. There was scarcely a foreigner in their ranks; all were natural born Americans. But the levies of our southern brethren were sadly adulterated with such rabble, as could be bought cheapest. There were some noble exceptions, of course—Smallwood's regiment, and Morgan's were full blooded southerners; their arteries running with fire and chivalry. About the time when these discontents first broke out, Archibald came accidentally in contact with a yankee named Copely, Chester Copely—a strange, cold blooded fellow, with resolute features, light grey eyes, and a remarkably muscular, sinewy frame; of the middle size—with a little twist in his neck, to the left, that cost him many a pleasant gibe. He was a man of few words—bitter and sarcastick—and no companion. There was something mysterious, too, in his manner toward Archibald; for, contrary to his known habits, he seemedto court the acquaintance of my haughty brother. And in time—such was the nature of his temper—the cold, silent dominion that he exercised over all about him—that Archibald himself, a creature, whose very tread was rebellion to all that looked like an assumption of authority over him—became so infatuated with this man, that he would put up with any thing from him. I never liked him—nor did Arthur; yet it would have been impossible to give a reason for it—except that there was a sullen, implacable steadiness; a sort of passionless insensibility in all that he said and did, which bore hard upon us, I confess; with an expression of superiority. Nothing seemed to move him. He would say the bitterest things, and the pleasantest, with precisely the same tone. Why he had sought Archibald's acquaintance, was a matter of inquiry with all our division. He was known and shunned; and, when they appeared together, there was a general expression of surprise. I suspected some design in it, yet, what could it be? Archibald was not popular—nor rich—nor powerful. This thing had continued about two months, until Arthur and I had forgotten to speak of it, even to each other; and the troop, who were passionately devoted to Archibald, had become, in a measure, reconciled to the cold evenness of temper---so unlike what it had been—that characterised him, and grew upon him, day by day, after his acquaintance with the Yankee. I have seen Copely, when I thought him handsome; no, not handsome—something better, higher, nobler.— There was a remarkable expression of manhood and strength in his manner of sitting, standing, or even in folding his arms. His forehead was very high, but sunburnt, and hard. So knitted were his joints; so compact his frame, so firm his tread, and so confident and cool were all his movements, that there was not a man in the army whom I would not sooner have encountered, than Chester Copely. I have never seen a hero—for Washington was of a race above heroes; but my notion has always been, that Copely was intended for one. But let me give you some example of his conduct and conversation. They will enable you to judge better of his true character, than any general description. After we had first seen him, and noted him for the cold, strange indifference of his look, on all occasions— in battle and out—it was remarked that he would be absent, for a week or ten days at a time, in the neighbouring country, without any notice being taken of it; nay, it would almost seem, without asking leave; for, when nobody else was permitted to move beyond our entrenchments, the yankee captain used to come and go, as freely as if our camp had been a publick market place. At last, a rumour came among us, that he was in the confidence of Washington, to a degree passing all belief; and that he was consulted, whenever any affair of moment, was in agitation—alone, and apart from all the favorites of Washington. How true this was, I cannot take upon myself to say; for he never spoke or hinted of any such power or confidence; and, when others hinted at it, pretty broadly too, at times, he paid precisely the same kind of attention to it, that he did to every thing else; neither affecting concealment, nor frankness—but wearing always the same—not haughty, it was not haughty, but proud, insensible regal front, as if the things that troubled other men, were beneath his attention, except in the mechanical routine of his duty, and there he was unrivalled. His discipline was stern, implacable, unrelenting, less from any feeling of ambition, or because he coveted the name of a disciplinarian—but merely, as if—he scorned to be outdone, even in what he regarded as beneath him. That he was on a footing, different from that of any other young man, in the army, with Washington, I can testify to, from my own knowledge. I was eye witness once, of a scene, where Washington stood before him, with a troubled countenance—and an agitated frame—and seemed, for a whole minute, unconscious of my presence: while Copely eyed me, with his cold bright balls, all the while, as if he had been expecting me. It was just about this time, that he formed an acquaintance with Archibald; and, there were hours, when, as they passed me in the dark, or at night, treading in time, upon the snow before our tents, I should have believed that they were brothers—and I a stranger. More than once, have I heard a suppressed sob; from, I dare not say, that it was from Copely, for his unalterable nature never showed a symptom of feeling equal to that, in the day time—no tear, no smile, no laugh. Happen what would, he was the same, to all outward appearance; collected and distant, not from affectation, or melancholy, or reserve, or sorrow, but, perhaps I am wrong, but such was my thought at the time, from a natural feeling of superiority misplaced. He was deeply read, and had travelled; but this was not to be discovered by a common man. He disdained to parley with a common man; not because he despised, or pitied him; or was proud of his own character; but from a natural incapacity to herd with him. It was thought that he never slept during the night; for, pass his tent, when we would, he was always sitting at his table, if in camp—like one employed on forbidden matters, about which he was careless, because there was none but himself, to understand them. At last, a report reached us, after one of his longest absences, at a time when we were just about breaking up, in the hope of a battle from Sir William Howe, that he was to be married—and that too, immediately, to one of the most extraordinary women in the country. How the report came, where it originated, we know not. But there was a cloud upon his face, at his return; and his conferences with Archibald were more frequent than ever. I remonstrated; and mentioned something of my suspicion, and thought, concerning him. Archibald smiled; but his lips were agitated; I saw that. Arthur observed too, that he always went armed, beyond what seemed required by his situation; that the door of his tent was always secured, and that he never admitted any person, till he had first made a bustle within. These were trifles, but they all served to quicken our observation and wonder. We learnt too, that he was the subject of especial animosity to several southern officers; and, one day, it was just after the report of his intended marriage had reached us, we made an attempt to rally him about it. He had been riding out with Archibald; and, when they returned, whether it was that their faces had become flushed with the exercise, or that something had happened to disturb them, I knew not—but I thought that I had seldom seen two heads more unlike each other, and, at the same time, so full of character. Copely too, had equipped himself in a new uniform, that laced athwart his broad chest, so as to exhibit all its manly proportions; and the contrast between his marked and athletick frame— and the delicate expressiveness of Archibald's, would have been worthy of a painter. Copley was a little the taller—but, in every movement, there was the strength of a lion—but that of a lion sleeping; while every movement of my brother was that, in the quietest time of a young catamount, her sinews always crouching—while her joints are all loose and supple. But, before I relate what I am about to, you will bear this in mind; that Copely talked to all men, on all occasions, in the same manner; saying, with a face like cast iron, the severest things in the world, without appearing to intend it. And yet, there was no affectation of dry humour, or simplicity, or gravity in him. All was natural, and uniform, like the expression of a strong brain, and solid heart; and, when we were, sometimes, all struck aback at the abrupt plainness of his manner; he would look round upon us, as if he pitied our amazement, and knew that what he had done—was nothing—in comparison with what he could do. He had a strange faculty too, of facing upon you, and throwing all your thought into disorder, by some short remark, that you could not forget—to your dying day; were anxious to resent—but could not.— Add to all this, that, without appearing to intend it, he always appeared to take his stand exactly upon that line, which separates impunity from accountability. Time and again, have I seen dark eyes flashing, swollen lips writhing, and brave hearts, throbbing under what he had said—while it would have been impossible to quarrel with him for it. He was hated, hated, with a deadliness and steadiness, by the Virginia interest, surpassing all that I have ever seen. Yet my brother adhered to him—and held aloof even from his beloved Virginians, to consult with him. And now, I will attempt to give you an idea of his manner, from a conversation that he held with us on that very evening, after he appeared, for the first time, in a new uniform, which had probably given rise to the report that he was to be married. It was a few weeks before the battle of Brandywine. Arthur, Copely, a Captain Henshaw, (one of the most quiet creatures, that ever breathed, but the devil in battle) and myself, were forming a party in the new quarters of Archibald, which, by the united effort of the troop, after his recovery, had been made very comfortable. Copely sat facing me, the red fire light flashing in his face,—his elbows square, and toes turned in, exactly as if he were on horseback. We had been admiring the cut of his uniform. `Well Copely,' said Henshaw, in his pleasant, deliberate way, `so you are to be married?' `God forbid!'—was the reply. `Why so?'—said Arthur. Copely made no answer, except by shrugging his shoulders. `Do you deny it?' said Archibald—I thought, with a slight agitation about the mouth. `Yes,' said Copely. `What!' retorted Archibald, leaning toward him. `Do I not know, that you are courting—and preparing for it—and, that the day is fixed?' VOL. II. 5 `True,' answered the impenetrable man. `Then, why deny it?' said I. `I do not deny that. I only deny that I shall be married—and I recommend the same conduct to every other man.—I would never own it, till the benediction had been pronounced, unless I were sure that there was not another man in the world.' `You are very bitter?' said Archibald. `No; I may be very honest. But you look (addressing himself to me,) as if you had something at your heart.' `Delight, and astonishment,' said I. `Pho, you dont mean any such thing—you may feel surprise and pleasure—but few things would delight or astonish such a man as you.' `But why marry,' said Arthur, `with such an opinion of women.' `Why spill my blood, at sixpence a day? Because, I must be occupied in one way or another.' `But why rail at marriage?' said Henshaw, laughing—`where there is such a charming example before you—Colonel R—, he has married three wives.' `Yes—and that is not all.' `What else has he done?' `Survived them. I reverence him—I never let him pass me, without taking off my hat—rain or shine. I gaze upon him, as I would upon the Duke of Marlborough, or Turenne, or Eugene. The veteran!' `Copely,' said Archibald, changing his whole manner. `Do you know why I have called you together this evening?' `No.' `There is a conspiracy against you.' `I know it,' said Copely. `They are determined to provoke you; and put you out of the way, if they can.' `I know it.' `You had better keep out of the way awhile'—said Archibald, with some emotion—`will you?' `No.' `But what will you do?' `Exactly what I have always done.' `But they will insult you.' `I expect it.' `Challenge you.' `Undoubtedly.' `Cut your throat.' `I don't believe it.' `Shoot you.' `Probably.' `And yet, dear Copely,' said Archibald, drawing his chair up to him, and leaning upon his shoulder, while Copely's stern features—no not stern—his steady features were red with the fire light—`of what avail will it be? what can you do? You do not expect, alone, to fight up the New England character—do you?' `Yes.' `You are mad—there are thirty of them, and not more than six or eight of your side, whose principles will permit them to fight a duel.' `I am mad.' `But what will you do—if the whole thirty challenge you one after the other?' `Fight the whole thirty—when I have nothing better to do.' `But why not keep out of their way?' `Because they have threatened me.' `And so, you throw yourself into their way.' `No—not a step. I behave just exactly, as if I had never heard of the matter.' The above will give you some idea of the man. I will now relate an affair or two, which will give you a better one. Just before the battle of Brandywine—nay, before the encampment broke up at Morristown, Archibald and I, were tilting at a ring, in a large circular enclosure, which we called the riding school. Copely was there; but he seemed to take no interest in the sport, until a Virginian—he, of whom I have already spoken, Major Ellis—as the tall, martial, blackeyed fellow, that was with Clinton at the time of his death, after a hard game, had borne off the ring, repeatedly, in better style than Archibald, who, before his illness, had no match in the troop. Archibald was vexed not a little, by the airs of the conqueror; and, as he backed his horse just in front of me, and caught my eyes, he struck his blade into one of the wooden posts, with a force that astonished me; saying, at the same time, that he could bear to be beaten by anybody better than that man. The Major scowled—and my brother, in a pet, swore that he was ashamed of himself and his troop. I saw the cloud gathering. But Copely, turning to Archibald, asked him what he would give him to beat the victor? `Give you!' said Archibald—`a pair of pistols such as haven't their match in the army.' `Dismount a moment,' said Copely, in reply, with his head on one side. Archibald could not believe him to be in earnest; and none of us had ever seen him in heat, as he used to call it, when a good swordsman went handsomely through his divisions. `Mind the stirrup!' said Archibald—as Copely reined up the horse, and grasped the mane with his left hand, preparing to mount, as if on parade—`if you touch the stirrup, you'll never touch the saddle.' Copely made no reply; but was in the seat, and running full speed at the ring, which he took off, and replaced at every successive evolution, till the whole circus rang with huzzaz. When, he dismounted, and returned to the same position, which he had occupied before, and there stood, with his arms folded, precisely as if he had no concern in what was going forward. Archibald could hardly forbear embracing him on the spot; but the Major was overflowing with wrath and blackness. `We shall have a quarrel out of this;' said Archibald, turning a little pale, `I perceive it.' `Yes,' said Copely, just as if he had been asked to take a pinch of snuff—`it is very probable.' And so it happened; for the major began abusing first, all mankind—then, all horseman—then, all strangers—then, all captains—and finally, all Yankees.— Finding that nobody was disposed to answer him; and, when he had fairly run out of breath, after working himself into a passion, that I expected every moment— for he grew black in the face—would end in an apoplexy—he stood still, fumbling about the hilt of his hanger. There was a dead silence. Copely stood, with his arms folded, looking him in the face, as if he had been some object, rather of curiosity than fear. `Did you know, sir,' said he, in his natural cold tone; `that I am a Yankee.' `Did I—yes, and be damned to you,' said the other, riding fiercely up to him; `and what then?—take it as you like.' `Thank you,' he replied, `I admire your courtesy.' For the world, I would not have undergone the look that Copely gave him. There was neither contempt, nor scorn, nor pity, nor defiance, nor compassion in it; but it was a compound, that—would have made me feel like a fool, for years afterward, had I thought of it, as having been levelled at me. `Stop sir,' continued Copely, seeing the other about to wheel off, as if to hide his perturbation—`I have a word to say to you,'—this was in the same tone—the same attitude—and he was unarmed. `You have said what I hope you will be sorry for. At present, I have no more to say to you. But, once for all, I would have you understand that this language is never to be repeated in my presence. I shall be happy to see you here to-morrow, at the same hour, with the same company.' `With all my heart!' said the other, `now or then, it is all the same to me.' `Nay—you appear to misunderstand me. You are in a passion. I cannot permit myself to retort now. VOL. II. 5* I give you till to-morrow to think of your conduct. Remember—I do not challenge you: I do not come here to-morrow, to fight you. But, I shall meet you here.' The major looked down upon him for a moment, as if he would have ridden over him, in the scorn and detestation of his heart. But nothing moved Copely— nothing, though Archibald appeared exceedingly disturbed, and had been several times on the point of interfering. `What do you intend to do?' said Archibald, after a silence of nearly half an hour, as we were returning. `You shall know to-morrow. I never bark;' was the reply. The next day, he went with us, unarmed, contrary to all our remonstrances. `Pho,' said he, coldly, `if I arm, there will be bloodshed. I am not prepared for that.' We found the major there, surrounded by four or five as handsome fellows as I ever saw, looking black as death, however, while they held aloof from the exercise. They saw that Copeley was unarmed; and their lips curled, as they called the attention of Major Ellis to the circumstance; and he muttered something, which was too true—but it made my heart giddy, for a moment, with passion—and Archibald's hand search for the hilt of his cimetar. The exercises were gone through with in a sort of sullen, discontented silence; and Copely stood all the while, precisely in the same spot—in the same attitude—with the same countenance—natural—and careless. `Gentlemen,' said he, turning his eyes, leisurely, round the enclosure; `I see some new faces; but are all here now, that were here yesterday?' `Aye! aye! sir!' was the reply, from twenty voices, at the same moment; while the major, leaning his warlike person over the broad white mane of his charger, which swept abroad at every movement of the neck, like breakers flying in the wind, seemed delighted with the prospect; a little more, I thought, than was natural, for his feet rattled in the stirrups. `Well, Major Ellis,' said Copely, in the same unaltered, unalterable tone; `have you nothing to say to me, for the intemperate language that you held to me yesterday?' `To you! God! is it come to this! I thought that you had something to say to me.' `I have,' was the reply; `but I would first know if you have well considered it. You have nothing to say then?' `Nothing,' said the other, haughtily. `I am sorry for it. It compels me to use harsh language to you. You are a blockhead—an overgrown blockhead. You are an overbearing man, with, I believe, very little courage at the heart. You are a disgrace to Virginia; and, had I any virginia blood in my veins, I would cut your throat for the dishonour that you have done it, by your brutal misbehaviour. I have done.' I looked at the major; he was trying to draw his sabre—and, every moment, I expected to see him fall from his unruly horse, as he bent over for the purpose; while Archibald, with a keen eye, and spurs ready to strike into his charger, sat, with his blade glimmering in his hand, as if anticipating the result. But Copely—I was more and more amazed at the expression of his countenance—at every movement. I verily believe, that he would have stood with his arms folded, though Ellis had charged upon him, and the iron hoofs and glittering sword were above his eyes. But before the major could extricate his sword, which had became entangled in his trappings, one of his companions had interfered, and obtained a suspension of the judgment, that his heart had evidently pronounced. `You will hear from me,' said he, yielding to his friend, and passing out. `If you please,' said Copely. `And me! and me! and me!' said the others. `If you please;' he replied to each. We returned to our quarters; and were hardly housed, when a stranger brought a note to Copely. He read it—and reaching it to Archibald, whose hand shook now, though it did not shake when he received Clinton's for himself—he asked him what he thought of it? `Sit down, young man,' said Copely, to the stranger. The stranger bridled, like a blood horse fretting on the bit—and made no other answer than a reluctant, haughty inclination of the head. He was true Virginia! I could have hugged him for it; I hated the Yankees. `I have nothing to say.' said Archibald, returning it; `it is a matter for your own determination.' The stranger bowed, and said that the friend of Captain Copely would communicate with him, and return an answer, when it was agreeable. `Very courteous—very—said Copely. But stop young man. Tell the major that I will meet him.' `Please to write it, Sir.' `No, Sir.' `And when —?' `When?—ah, well considered. I should like to spill some blood for my country first. To day is friday. Oadley, what think you of next week? I have a good deal of writing on hand.' `As you please,' said Archibald. `No, no—next week, I am to be married. I must fight one battle first. I should like to rehearse. The major and I can fight afterward, though I should happen to be disabled. But I might not do for the enemy, after he and I had met.—Tell the major, that I will meet him, and all his friends, one after the other.—Let's see—to day is friday; any time that he pleases, after we have had one brush with the enemy; and I have had a—a—after I have had my likeness taken. I should be sorry to leave no resemblance behind me. Is he married?' `Sir, I am in no disposition to trifle,' said the stranger. `Nor I, God knows. My question is enough to prove that. If he be not, tell him that I give him the same time that I shall take, to bequeath his lineaments; we might make it a very pretty family piece.' `And what am I to say, Sir? Yes, or no?—when, and where, and how?' `Peremptory enough! But the where and how, I leave to him. The when, I must be permitted to determine. I wish that I could fix the day; but I cannot. These cursed matters of marrying, and fighting, must be gone through with, first. I am under an engagement; a foolish one I grant; but I never break my word. After that, tell the major to call in, any time when he is going by, and I shall be happy to entertain him, or any of his friends.' `And this is your answer?' said the stranger. `Yes, Sir.' `You will not be surprised, I hope, if the major should accost you with a horsewhip to-morrow?' `Not in the least,' he replied. The stranger left us—and we burst out into one loud peal of laughter. There was something so irresistibly comick in the indifference of Copely, which, whether felt or feigned, every one of us envied.' But the major did not attempt to horsewhip him, probably from the fear of our commander; and Copely continued to go among them, just as usual, till the afternoon previous to his marriage, when I saw him embrace Archibald, in whose eyes, when I met him, were the traces of tears; hot tears, such as are wrung from high hearts, by a pressure that scorches, while it exhausts them. But that very night, Copely returned again—or rather, the next morning; for, about two o'clock, I heard his voice, and saw Archibald throw on his watch cloak, and rejoin him;---they walked away together, and appeared, whenever they approached, by the sound of their voices, and the movement of Archibald's shadow upon the wall, to be in earnest conversation. At last, they separated; and, when Archibald had thrown himself upon the bench, with a dim lamp shining upon his face, I saw it working for several minutes like a convulsion. `What has happened?' said I. `He was to have been married to night, was he not? What brought him back?' `Death,' said he, in a low voice. `Death!---heavenly father---was she dead?' `No, no, would that she were. But do not ask me. He is not married. Good night!' `Good night!' I saw Copely in the morning---and fancied---perhaps it was only fancy, that he was paler and sterner than I had ever seen him; but perhaps he had grown paler by watching, as he had, week after week.' And so the time passed away, his intimacy remaining about the same, till the battle of Brandywine, in which he fought, it is said, with the cool intrepidity of a veteran, spurring into the hottest fire, with a senseless disregard to danger, utterly unlike the distempered eagerness of young men that are brave—and resembling, what one might look for in a creature, that felt himself to be immortal, invulnerable, and exceedingly potent. But, the battle over, and a moment of repose allowed to it, the pledge of blood was to be redeemed. It was night—I had just heard the report of a pistol; and on looking out, saw a crowd of soldiers rushing into Copely's tent. A part of them soon returned bearing, what appeared by their movements, as they staggered along over the uneven ground, to be a dead body. I ran out in a paroxysm of terrour. It was a dead body—the body of Major Ellis. Copely had shot him through the brain. I entered his tent, and saw him, in his shirt sleeves, bandaging his left arm, which hung, as if broken, over the chair—with his own hand. He never took off his eyes from the arm, but continued the operation—though the sweat stood upon his forehead (and heart too, I dare say) in loose drops, when I entered. Archibald followed me. `What have you done?' said he. `Shot the Major,' he answered, without lifting his eyes. `And what has he done?' `Shot me,' was the reply. `How happened it?' `How! he accepted my invitation—called, as he was going by—and I—having the vapours—I suppose, for I have been very low spirited of late; and would have done any thing, for pastime—I consented to exchange a few shot. The man was exceedingly importunate— and I thought it a pity to trouble him to call again; so I took one of his pistols, as I sat—he on one side of that table, I on the other, just as I am now, for I had begun to turn in—and my coat being too tight for me, had thrown it off.' `Poor fellow!' said Archibald. `Yes—poor fellow!' echoed Copely, in the same tone. `It was a great pity that he called—I told him so.' I left the room in horrour—went to my bed, and soon fell into a troubled, disorderly dreaming, that shook and wasted me like a long illness. Let me attempt some description of it—some only; for it would be impossible, by any power of language, to give a faithful one. I was asleep. At dead of midnight, I heard a trumpet, as I thought, sounding to battle. I arose, pained and dizzy,—unwilling to go out—and desirous to skulk, if I could, into the holes of the rocks. Then I thought that it began to rain fire upon me; and the earth shook, and battalions of men, armed all over in shining mail, spattered with blood, came, parading, column after column, from the earth—nation after nation—each of loftier, and yet loftier stature still, -warlike—and terrible, like the buried Apostles of liberty: and then, all at once, there was a tremendous explosion, and I felt myself sinking in a swamp—the loose earth quivering like jelly, at every tread, and cold serpents and bloated toads all slipping about me, so thickly, that, set my naked foot, wherever I would, something that had life in it—some fat icy reptile would stir under the pressure—and then I was entangled in the thorny creeping tendrils of many a plant that encumbered my path; dead bodies lay in my way; I was pinioned hand and foot, and serpents fed upon my blood, and vultures flapped over me. And then, out of the east, there blazed, all at once, a light, like a million of rockets, that blinded me. And then, I felt a hand—the hand of a murderer about my throat—God!—that could be no dream, it was too distinct! Even in my sleep, I felt it, and started broad awake. My heart stopped—stopped, as if struck with death! a hand was upon my head!— feeling about my hair; as if to get a good hold. I shuddered—gasped—`Archibald!' said I, `dear Archibald! (Archibald had been suspected of walking in his sleep, since the death of Clinton.') The blood rushed back to my heart—I put out my hands. They encountered a human creature. `Archibald!' I repeated, with all my force. No answer. `What art thou?' I cried, starting up, and putting out my hands toward a hideous shape, that sat on the table near me, with its long legs swinging carelessly under it, and creaking like the joints of a gibbeted man. I heard something rattle on the floor. It was a large knife. The lamp gleaned upon the blade, as the creature stooped to pick it up. I was desperate now. I threw myself upon it, in silence; and, after a struggle, in which I, who could have torn a wild beast, limb from limb, had well nigh been mastered—I said to it. `What the devil are you?' `Nick Sampson,' he replied. `Nick Sampson! what business have you here! How is Ellen?' `Dying. You have broken her heart. I came to kill you—but I could not. You were sleeping. That saved you.' Judge of my feelings. They were unutterable. It was a long time before I was able to speak, while the shapeless wretch sat before me, like a coiled reptile, his, small bright eyes glittering under his heavy eyebrows, as if he were hardly satisfied with his own clemency. At last, however, a new feeling took possession of me. My horrour and affright had gone; and my eyes were already running along the bright blade of the knife, and glancing at the door, with thoughts, that even now I shudder at. He certainly understood me, for he addressed me abruptly, thus. `You had better not.' The sound of his voice scared the demon away. A rush of humanity and gratitude came back to me, flooding my heart, with a gentle warmth, like new milk—the weapon fell from my hand. `How came you here, Sampson?' said I. `By dodging the sentinels.' `What! to night! they are doubled, and very vigilant.' `Vigilant!' I found one asleep. And the other I passed in his own shadow. `And how is Ellen?' `Ellen,' his eye snapping fire---`Ellen! washing her heart away with her own tears!' `God bless her!' `What, Oadley, what! do you really pity poor Ellen ---really? or (menacing me) are you---damn it, you cannot be such a villian---are you mocking me, or not?' `No,' said I, amazed at his look and manner. `No!' `But where is she? how is her health?' `I've told you, the sap of her heart is running to waste; she has cried herself blind.'</field>
      <field name="fulltext">VOL. II. 6 CHAPTER IV. `I've loved to hear the war horn's cry; `And panted at the drum's deep roll; `And held my breath, when, flaming high, `I've seen our starry banners fly, `As, challenging the haughty sky, `They stirred the battle in my soul.' Nicholas left me, as he came, abruptly, and in the darkness; and I was awakened the next morning by the sound of Jasper's voice at my door. `We have taken a devil!' he cried; `please to turn out. He swears to your acquaintance. Halloo, there!' I leaped off the chest where I slept, and found poor Nicholas in the hands of two of our troop, who were menacing him with their sabres, at every flourish of which, he ducked—less in fear, than surprise, I thought. His countenance was so expressive, so ludicrously expressive, that I was fain to laugh. `Run him up,' cried Jasper—`run him up, directly; the Lieutenant does'nt know him.' `I know that,' said the other—`and I've a mind to do it.' `What has the poor creature done?' said I. `Knocked up the finest stallion in the troop,' said Jasper. `How, pray?' `By running him out, fairly out o' wind.' `Be kind enough to tell me, so that I can understand you,' said I. `Well, Sir,' said Jasper, his red, honest face shining as if basted in blood gravy—`I was out near the north battery, just one hour before day light. Simpson, Hodgers, and two or three more of our fellows, were sleeping at the guard house—our horses saddled and bridled, just by. Suddenly, I heard a shot—`Halloa!' I cried—for the round dozen that Corporal Capen had, for sleeping on his post t'other night, had made our men more wakeful—`Halloa,' said I, running out, `who goes there?' Nobody answered me; but I saw a black shadow running, like a rabbit, along the ground; and then, a shower of bullets was sent after him— damn it, don't laugh, beast; I'll stop your grinning. So, I jumped a-straddle, leaped the ditch, and rode after him; Bill backed the stallion, and run him till he slipped his wind, while that devil there kept leaping the ditch, for half an hour, with one of us after him, first one side and then the other. Shall we hang him?' I laughed at the impudence of the fellow, for daring to play such pranks in my presence—and sent him off. `Where were you going?' said I, to young Nick, as soon as we were left alone. `Home.' `Suppose you enlist.' `I will,' he answered, `as soon as I have seen Nell, and said good bye'—(striking his hands together, with a report that made me start—it was like a pistol.) `Surely,' said I, looking at him—and wondering at the expression of his face. It was lighted up, and he stood taller, by many inches than I had ever seen him! `Surely, you are not afflicted with ambition?' `Ambition?—what the devil's that?' `It is that,' said I, my chest heaving as I spoke— `it is that which dilates the heart, distends all the arteries, lightens and animates, and—' `Ha! ha! ha! No I've nothing of that. I have no desire to wear a beautiful jacket, or ride a handsome horse—would as soon taste blood in the ranks; nay, sooner, for there I should wade in it, as to drive my horse through it, fetlock deep. No but'—here was another outbreaking of brightness from his whole face, —`I am an American, a worthless, abandoned one, a wicked fellow, and willing to die, if it please God,— a better man than I have lived.—I love the trumpet. My heart bustles strangely when I hear it splitting away in the wind. The drum sets all my blood bubbling. And the new standard—lord! I could look at it, forever! the cannon too, and the smoke and — O, I would die, willingly, if I might be where such things are to be seen continually.' I looked at the creature in astonishment. `Surely,' said I, inwardly, and shuddering at the deep sanguinary hue of his lips, that quivered as he spoke—`surely, the appetite for blood is natural to us all—He!—Oh, men have understood it well; he cannot withstand the prompting of a wayward spirit—the fierce instinct— though it cometh not to him, with the bright beckoning of a woman mailed, as it does to me—nor with a countenance of dominion. There is no command for him, no hope, nothing but derision and mockery; yet, for the pleasure of dabbling in human blood, and watching the red issue of broken hearts—he is willing to put body and soul in jeopardy.' `Why—what the devil have you there?' cried Archibald, coming up. I told him, as well as I could, all that I knew of the matter; and in return, asked him how Copely was. `Bad enough,' he replied—his left arm shattered— under arrest. And—poor Chester!' `Chester,' said I. `Who is he?' `Chester Copely,' was the reply. `I thought his name was Charles.' `So did I, till this morning, when I saw it written at length. He always writes C. Copely, and that is the reason, I suppose, for I never asked, that we have always supposed his name to be Charles.' `There seems to be a great bustle in camp,' said I. `Does the affair make such a noise?' `O, no—but we are on the eve of something, I know not what—ah!' A horseman here came up, saluted Archibald, and informed him that the Commander in Chief was on horseback, at the west battery (a little redoubt, hastily thrown up) waiting for him. His horse was brought out; and he set forward, a minute or two ahead of me. When I arrived on the ground, I saw him, bare headed, fronting the commander, whose countenance was remarkably stern; but it gradually changed, and just as I passed, I heard him say. `There is your Commission Sir. I am glad to find that you had no hand in this affair. It must be put a stop to. You are brevetted for the present.' From that moment, Archibald was a Major. `I am afraid,' said he, faltering—and I stopped my horse, immediately, that I might not lose a word—`that—that I am not altogether blameless. Yet—I was not present.' `Enough,' said Washington. `Keep in your saddle from ten this morning. We shall have work for yo before night.' Archibald joined me, with a countenance particularly thoughtful and solemn. `What is the matter?' said I. `I am a Major,' he replied. `And does that make you sorrowful?' `Yes—I do not deserve it. Many a better man will be under my command—many a better man; and I am but a boy.' `But you can deserve it.' `Yes! that is true—and I will, or die. I will not be in the way of any man that deserves it better.' `Are we to do any thing?' `Yes—did you see the general's face?' `See it!' said I—`yes, and shook all over, as I did see it. How preternaturally dark it was.' `Very,' he replied, `very. It bodes another Trenton visitation, I am apt to think. But hush—Let us be wary.' Washington passed us again now, at a slow, warlike movement, his tall martial person habited in a uniform, which I will try to describe:—the waiscoat was buff, plain buff, without an atom of gold about it, very long, VOL. II. 6* and opening at the bottom, with flaps; the coat, what we call a French blue, rather worn and dusty, exceedingly tight in the arms and open always;—breeches buff, and boots in the clumsy fashion of the day, reaching to the knees—but without any expression: the whole costume wearing the look of what is meant for service, rather than parade. As he passed us, he uncovered to our general salution, with a dignity and plainness that I never saw equalled. But do what he would—he was always George Washington—full of beautiful simplicity and power. In two hours more, we were in motion, under himself in person, and advanced to Skippack creek, where we encamped. It was about sixteen miles from Germantown, where the main body of the enemy lay; Cornwallis having followed Howe to Philadelphia.— Lord Howe had gone round from the Chesapeake, to cooperate with his brother, in reducing the forts upon Mud Island, and Red Bank, in and upon the Delaware. Washington was constantly in the saddle—and the whole army in a state of fiery excitement, from the news that came in every day, respecting the operations at the north against Burgoyne, who was already in a most critical situation. By the way, I forgot to mention in the proper place, that we sustained a severe loss a few nights before this movement, by General Wayne's suffering himself to be surprised, and then, most unluckily, parading his men in front of their fires, so that every shot told—we lost nearly three hundred of our best troops, bayonetted on the spot. On the third of October, we were handsomely reinforced, and Washington led us against the enemy at Germantown, rationally supposing that the contemplated operations upon fort Mifflin, and Red Bank, would leave the enemy's main body considerably weakened at Germantown. The enemy were pitched about the centre of the town. His left on the Schuylkill; covered by the chasseurs; the right handsomely protected, stretching far out to the west—with a battalion in front, occupying chesnut hill. Our plan was too complicated—the ground was broken up by enclosures; a heavy fog covered the whole ground, which was exceedingly uneven—and we could not see a pistol-shot from our horses heads. And, from the time we entered the field, leaning about in a most disorderly manner, until we heard Pulaski raging like a devil all about us, leaping heages and ditches, and calling out the day is our own! the day is our own!— I had not seen, or heard any thing of Archibald or Arthur. But in five minutes more, they had both passed me, erect on their saddles, and shouting to us, that the horse of the enemy, (a squadron under Cornwallis, just arrived for Philadelphia,) were riding Greene down.— At the time, we knew little of what was going forward. Again and again, were we utterly lost, in the heavy fog, mistaking our own party for the enemy, and being mistaken in our turn. A tremendous firing was kept up, it appeared, at every corner of the heavens— a part of both armies had fallen into each others hands; and, but for the abominable delay at a stone house (into which Col. Margrave, threw himself in the heat of the battle, checking our main body, and holding out till all the enemy were upon us,) we should have given a good account of the day's work, I believe. But, be that as it will, we were in time to cover the retreat of our army—exchange some cuts with Cornwallis' horse; and hold him in check, till Steven's artillery opened upon them, with a destruction like that which fell upon Sodom and Gommorah—breaking through whole ranks at every discharge, and blowing platoon after platoon into the air—man and horse. The Marylanders under Conway, (forming a part of Sullivan's division) fought like so many armed knights. Archibald got a cut over the left temple, which soon healed; but neither Pulaski, nor Arthur, nor myself, was wounded, though I had my bear skin cap, riddled like a honeycomb; and my horse was bayonetted in three places; and Arthur had stirrup and bridle shot away. Yet, I saw Pulaski cleave one fellow to the chine, at the moment it appeared to me, that a pistol was fired into his very face and eyes. I looked a moment though I was hotly engaged with two good swordsmen, in the expectation of seeing him fall; but, in a twinkling, he was out of sight, his blade rattling like hail, about the bayonets that hedged him in, as he passed in a circle of incessant fire, giving point and edge, at the same moment. He had a horse killed under him; but immediately brought down his antagonist from the saddle, mounted his horse, and rejoined his men. And here, I cannot forget to mention, that, a long time after the battle, Archibald and I rode over the ground again, step by step, each pointing out to the other, the spot where every vicissitude and accident had occurred to himself. I remember too, as if it were but yesterday, his pointing out the window at the left wing of Chew's house, which a spirited young officer, under the very eye of Washington, attempted to set fire to; and the very tree, under which he died a few moments after the attempt. The window is yet shattered and blackened with the attempt, and the walls are indented and bruised, all about, with the idle cannonading of our light artillery; and a friend of mine lately informed me of a remarkable fact, which has escaped the notice of all of our historians; and which, had it been known at the time, might have changed the issue of the day. When Washington ordered up the field pieces, and they had began to play upon the house, (which is built of a very solid, heavy stone) he went a little in advance, to reconnoitre; and, owing to the fog and smoke, was deceived into a belief, that one of the back buildings, connected with the house, had been changed since he had seen it, (for he had been perfectly acquainted with the house and family,) and deliberately fortified. The building, even yet, has a formidable appearance, and I can readily conceive, that a military man might hesitate a good while, before he would attempt to storm it, while seen through a mist. By this appearance Washington was prevented from attempting to carry it in the rear, by which he would undoubtedly, have succeeded, for there were all its weak points, there was it most accessible, and there, least capable of defence. But to return. After this battle, we returned to Skippack and encamped; lying, literally upon our arms, until the news of Burgoyne's surrender came upon us like a clap of thunder. I was not ten feet from Washington, when the officer, covered with dust and froth, handed him a letter—exclaiming, at the same time—`Burgoyne and his whole army have surrendered!' The news went, like a peal of electricity through the camp. `Hourra! Hourra! Hourra!' exclaimed the men running together in all directions. `Hourra! Hourra! Hourra!' shouted the officers, utterly forgetful of Washington's presence. But I—I could neither speak nor breathe, nor take off my eyes from his face. He read the whole letter through—turned it over in his hand—looked at the date—asked a question or two, as if taught by experience, that good news were not lightly to be depended upon.—But when it was all confirmed— all!—I thought, for a moment, that he would have fallen from his horse. A mighty paleness overspread his whole face—like moonlight over Roman sculpture. His great heart laboured—his lip worked— his chest heaved; he turned up his clear eyes to God—gave his hand to the messenger; who looked as if he could have fallen upon his face, and lain there for Washington to drive his white charger over; and then dismounted, and withdrew, alone—all, all alone to his tent. I am sure that it was to go down upon his knees —yes! I am sure of it; and every man that saw his troubled port—the august, patient tread of the hero, as he bowed his great forehead again, uncovered as it was, and walked away, felt as I did, that Washington had gone to prayer. It was a whole hour before a living man approached him. Who would have dared? who! to obtrude upon George Washington, while in conversation with Jehovah? I will not stop to relate what I was not an eye witness of—the operations upon the Delaware.—You will find the story well told in every history, upon which you can lay your hand: but keep upon the track that I have chosen. One thing I had forgotten. Young Sampson had remained with us; and it was said by a Virginian, though I did not see him, fought like `a ring-tailed panther,' in the battle. All that I know is, that he was taken prisoner, as he said, once or twice, that night; and esaped as often, with the blood of his captor, and his spoils into the bargain. To my knowledge, he had three handsome watches, and some gold, when he returned to the camp; and was smeared and soaked in human blood: nay, his very hair was stiffened with it; and for a week afterwards, the snow where his head lay, would be soiled with crimson, though I made him wash it twenty times at least. Yet, I doubt, if any of it was unfairly shed; unfairly, I mean, after the usages of war. His face was blacked and scorched with gunpowder, and he was nearly blind for a time; and his eye-lashes, were singed off. But he was not otherwise injured than by a bruise in the side, as he said, from a regiment of horse running over him. `With gun carriages at their heels, I dare say,' added Copely, who heard him account for it. Copely was now able to attend to duty again, and went about it with the same unaltered front—a little paler, and perhaps a little calmer than usual—with his arm in a sling. Our condition, at this time, was deplorable beyond all belief. Several thousand of our troops had not a blanket to wrap themselves in, though the winter had now set in, with unparalleled severity: a large portion were without breeches, shoes or stockings. We had exhausted all our money, and credit—and were, for a time, hardly less ragged than our men. On the fourth of December, Sir William Howe advanced upon us, in power, as if determined to exasperate us, naked and suffering as we were, to a rash engagement, that we might go into winter quarters with a tolerable feeling of security. But, after manœuvering several days in beautiful style, performing some of his evolutions within reach of our cannon, he, quietly, like the king of France, with twenty thousand men, marched up the hill, and then, marched down again. Our whole army were struck with astonishment; and Washington, not less than his troops. What could have led to such an unequivocal avowal of Sir William's respect, it would be difficult to say; but, we ought not to forget, that we were altogether his inferiours in every respect at the time; and, that every man in our army, felt the retreat of Sir William, as if we had obtained a victory over him. On the eleventh, we began a movement in search of winter quarters; and, finally pitched upon Valley Forge, a place about sixteen miles from Philadelphia. We arrived there on the sixteenth; and here let me pause. Here began our severest sufferings. Men may talk of their Romans, and their Greeks: of armies, that have perished in their own blood; cities in their smoke; martyrs and apostles to liberty, chanting their own death song. I have been in battle many times, by night and by day: I have been willing to spend my whole life in it; I have been wrapped in smoke and blaze; stunned, for hours together, with the noise of cannon; and blinded, for whole days, with the flash of musketry: yet, so help me God, I could spend a long life, in one uninterrupted battle, with less suffering, than I — (and my care was nothing to that of some others,) than I spent that winter at Valley Forge. Our poor fellows were barefooted, as I have told you; naked and starving. As I am a living man, in the presence of my Maker, I declare to you, that I have seen the dark, swollen, discoloured and lacerated feet of a whole company, frozen to the ground, in their own blood, when we halted for ten minutes. I remember it well; it is no exaggeration. There were not ten men among them, who had either stockings or shoes; and when they put their bruised soles to the earth, the blood gushed out as from a trodden spunge, so swollen and bloated were they. But why dwell upon it!—why? Because, since the creation of this world, there never was an army that endured so much, so patiently. Greeks and Romans! blisters on the American tongue, that shall dare to name them in comparison with our poor fellows! every foot fall was martyrdom; and when the winds blew, and the storm beat—and the fine snow drifted over them, as they lay, shivering and naked, upon their pallets; their stout hearts were never heard to complain. No! they lived, while they could; and, when they could live no longer—they died in silence. I have seen many a stout fellow; but one, I particularly remember, frozen hand and feet, chafing his purple limbs, for whole hours together, without uttering one word of sorrow or complaint. We made a town of log-huts, at the suggestion of our commander; kept constantly in motion; and were all inoculated with the small-pox: and this, in the very face of our enemy! For whole days, we were without a mouthful of bread; though our foraging parties, were all sent abroad, in every direction, to sieze and appropriate clothing and food: yet, were we without either, owing to the mismanagement of Congress—always interfering, whenever it was possible to make mischief. You would not wonder at my indignation, if you had seen a thousandth part of the suffering that I did, for the want of articles, that were actually lying about the country, purchased and paid for, and rotting in the woods. I—but, no, I cannot trust myself to do more than relate two or three simple facts. When we were eight thousand strong, we were obliged to report three thousand unfit for duty, on account of their nakedness; and this number was continually augmenting, till the greater part of the army were obliged to sit up, all night long, before the fire, smothered and blinded with smoke, instead of sleeping quietly, for they had no clothes to cover them. When we were prisoners too; but no—that ought to be a prohibited theme to a man of my passion. Great Britain dealt with us like a destroyer; but we must try to forget it. Thank God! and I do thank God for it, I was never their prisoner. But I have seen them that were—and Archibald, I remember, after his escape. He never recovered from it. `They have poisoned me,' he cried, `I have seen powdered glass in the wretched food that they gave me, on board the Jersey prison-ship. It was a slaughter-house; and the water grew black about her, as if with the plague, choaked up with human bodies.' This was all that he said. But he never forgot or forgave it; and, to my knowledge, exacted a fearful retribution for it. He was squalid and filthy, I have been told, beyond all expression, when he returned; but there was blood encrusted upon his face. One of his keepers had given up the ghost for his insult and cruelty; and Archibald burst his chains at the same moment. Follow me; a few steps will bring us to the opening of a new campaign. France had joined us. Gates, I believe, was at the bottom of a conspiracy to supplant Washington. Pulaski was appointed to a legion of horse, with the rank of major-general. Archibald's brevet was confirmed; Arthur was promoted to a captainship; Copely to a lieutenant colonelship in the infantry, and I—I remained a captain. We had now been nearly two years in actual warfare. Neither Archibald nor I, had seen our mother for fifteen months, though we frequently heard from her; and he, I suspected at the time, more frequently than ever. But at last, on the arrival of Sir Henry Clinton to supersede Howe—and the evacuation of Philadelphia; we heard that Mr. Arnauld had removed to that city. My heart throbbed mightily, when I heard of it. I longed to fall in their way, (her way, I ought to say,) by accident: and yet, there was the sunny-haired Ellenour; how should I meet her? I trembled at the thought. VOL. II. 7 Washington called a council of war, and proposed giving Clinton battle in his retreat; but, unluckily was overruled. So that—allow me to say, that there was a battle fought, called the battle of Monmouth, in which, I received a wound, that cost me my leg afterward;—and that Arthur particularly distinguished himself in it. This is all that I know of the affair. Archibald used to contract his forehead, when I spoke of it, saying, that `it was a hard fought, desperate, and unnecessary battle.' He had began to study the scene of war at the time: I had made considerable progress in it. `It would never have been fought.' said he, `had not Washington forgot himself, in his exasperation with Lee. And Lee—by heaven, he is an injured man! rash and haughty as he is. He was brave and skillful; and the court-martial, with Lord Sterling the president, were all a pack of blunderheads, or something worse, for suspending him.'</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER V. `Grim visaged War has smoothed his iron front.' Nearly three years had now passed in war and trial. It was time to repose awhile. The French fleet had arrived. The war upon the ocean began to break out in bright spots, like volcanoes, here and there. Sir William Howe had moved off to the south; and was battling in Georgia. We had little to do; except to plan small enterprizes for our out-posts to execute. Our mother had rebuilt a house upon the ruins of our old mansion, under the superintendance of an old servant; and Arthur had begun to think seriously of making himself happy, while it was possible for him to be so. `Where now brother?' said I, seeing him on a new sorrel charger, caparisoned in beautiful style, and Copely on a large white horse with a black mane and tail, at his side, `where now?' `To Philadelphia,' he replied. I felt oddly about the head, but I couldn't speak. `Will you join us? there is a furlough,' (handing me one.) `Bless my soul! brother! hey! what! woa!' I staggered against his horse. `Yes,' said I, `yes! happen what will—yes!' `To horse! to horse!' said Copely, dashing out, impatiently, to the right; to which I replied, in five minutes from the time of notice, by galloping along side of him, on my noble racer. `Upon my word, cousin!' cried Arthur, (his handsome eyes breaking out into light.) `You have not been so much yourself since, whoa!—since we manœuvered in the snow, on the night of—of—' `No more,' said Archibald, clapping spurs to his horse, `we shall expect you.' `Aye! aye!' was the reply; and we instantly set forward at a brisk trot. For some miles, not a word was spoken: for my part, I could not speak; my heart was too full; and as for Archibald, there was a look of deadly faintness, every now and then, in his face, which took away from me all power of questioning him. But Copely rode onward, with the same countenance; his left arm, yet stiff from the shattering that Ellis had given it; and his head turned, with that peculiar cast, on one shoulder, which, unless I had known that it proceeded from a sabre cut, I should have called affectation—something of the arrogant and lordly, worn because it fitted the turn of his chest and fashion of his face: and it did fit both; no man ever lived, on whom the patrician sat better than on Chester Copely. He looked not only as if born to dominion, but, as if dominion had been familiar with him from his boyhood; not the dominion of a Persian satrap, peevish and effeminate; nor that of a lazy bashaw; nor that of an English aristocrat, spiteful and jealous of all encroachment, yet wanting the manhood to resent or resist it: No! but it was that of one who would look a giant in the face, without winking, and tell him, in a slow voice, `Beware! the boy is already born, that shall break your sceptre!' Nay, that boy was born; allow me to digress for a moment. I think I can see him now, with his high forehead partitioned all over with swelling veins, half as large as your little finger, a little bald; just as he sat and looked but a few years ago, long after the revolution; when I saw him in conversation with Aaron Burr, the Cæ sar of America—the most astonishing and dangerous man of his age; a man that infused his own rebellious and fiery spirit into every thing, material or immaterial, with which he came in contact; a man, who went about working treason, tampering with the bravest and stoutest hearts of all our country—in the light of heaven, with an audacity unlike any thing, ever seen before in the history of disaffection; setting our laws at defiance—mocking at our strength—doing that, which, now he has failed in it, has been called madness; yet, for which, all the talent, and learning, and power of the country, were unable to punish him! a man, that poured his spirit of revolt, like a flood of fire, into every heart that he came near—disturbing the oldest and most cautious of our veterans; one, that seemed to put himself, life and name, into the power of every human creature that he approached; yet, with all this seeming, was he never in the power of mortal man, (as Wilkinson and Eaton can show;) a man, that suffered the legal wisdom of the whole country to array itself against him—without trembling—and then, just put out enough of his own strength, and no more, (wasting no jot or title of his power,) to defeat and shame them. O, it was miraculous! and, since the time of the Roman, there has never beena man upon this earth so like Julius Cæsar, as was Aaron Burr. Why did he not succeed? is the question with me; not, as it is with the deeper politicians of the age; why did he attempt it. The plan is deeper than is known—his resources greater. Aaron Burr was never the man to hazard all for nothing: a step more, and Mexico had been his; and then, who would have staid the conqueror? Where could you have entrenched yourselves? In no other place, and by no other means, than by encompassing yourselves round about, with a wall of fire. You musthave had swords passing forever about you—and artillery roaring night and day. Aye, one blow! and we, who now laugh the threat to scorn, would have seen the president of these United States, the congress, and all others in authority, driven into the Potomac. But enough. Let us thank God, that a soldier, and a despot was blasted when he was; and not believe as we are apt to, that we are inaccessable. Yes, I can see Chester Copely now—at this moment, as plainly as if he were before me; his bald head leaning upon his VOL. II. 7* hands—his grey eyes rivetted upon the tempter—who sat, pouring his deep, deep eloquence into his heart, so naturally, with such an air of beautiful simplicity, that, when it was over, Copely said to him, `You are a traitor, Aaron Burr; and I do not wonder that all, who listen to you, are traitors.' Perhaps—(will you pardon me for a moment?) I would give you some notion of the artful, terrible insinuation of Aaron Burr. We had been speaking of the danger to be apprehended from the continual enlargement of our territory. I knew Burr's aim. Copely knew it. Both of us would have slain the man who should have dared to propose a dismemberment, directly; yet, before Aaron Burr had done, we were ready—or at least I was—to draw my sword for him. Gracious heaven! what attitude and dominion are given to eloquence! He first remarked that we were already too large;—and, after some argument, we assented to it. `Where are the thirteen states now?' said Burr— `Look at the map. Look at their territory. They are a spot only in our empire. A few years, and they will be crushed. Of themselves in their integrity, they are invincible. But lengthen the sceptre, and you weaken it,—at the same time that you render it more unmanageable. It is not only weaker, but more difficult to be wielded.' `True,' said I—and Copely nodded an assent. `Well then,' said Burr—`when shall we stop? where shall we stop? Are we not already too large?—where is the profit of these new states? There is none. It costs more to govern them, than we obtain from them, even in peace. How shall we protect them in war? Are they not too large?' We assented; for, how could we help it? `Would it not be better then,' said he—(remember that I am giving you only the sum of his process— the detail, I am unequal to)—`if it might be amicably done, to retrench our dominion; to separate—contract our strength, and draw in our resources to the limits of our ancient empire—the thirteen confederate states?' `Certainly,' said I—`if it could be done amicably.' `And give them the power of constituting a government for themselves? them that have joined us, I mean?' said Copely, moving his head thoughtfully. `Yes,' said Burr. `Yes. If we withdraw—we must leave them to build a government for themselves. Let that be what it may, we should always be too formidable for them.' `Suppose then, that they should wish to separate,' he continued, after a slight pause, as if collecting all the dark subtilty of his mind, for that special occasion —`would you oppose them?' We were silent for some moments. `I think not,' said Copely. `But suppose, that we wished it—no matter for what reason,' said Burr—`and that they opposed it, which side would you take?' `That of manhood and reason,' said Copely—`cut them off, as I would a withered or rotten member, if the health of the heart were endangered.' `And who shall determine for us?' said Burr—in a deep, thoughtful voice. `Congress,' said Copely. Burr shook his head, with a mockery and scorn, that no mortal man could have withstood. `Congress!' said he. `They have not the power. It is the people.' `Men!' He rose from his seat. `Men! You love your country. So do I. You have fought her battles. So have I. You would die for her. So would I. You would risk life and limb; nay, reputation for her. You admit that our country is too large; that it would be wise to retrench it. You say that you would assist in doing so, if the excess were to desire it? or if our own original states should deserve it. This is enough. The salvation of your country is in your own keeping; we must pass a two edged sword round about her— we must lop off, without mercy, the diseased and exhausting members? They wish it; we wish it. All the wise and good know it. Then why wait for the steady movement and legislation of—' `Aaron Burr!' said Copely, rising, and facing the Arch-traitor, with the air of one that could take away his breath at a word. `I wonder at your power. I shudder at your disposition. You are a traitor, Burr; and he that listens to you, will be—must be, a traitor; nay, is, if he do not silence you. To night, you are under the protection of my roof. To-morrow—mark me—to-morrow, we are enemies. Good night!' He left the room—and I followed him, as he said these words, leaving Burr, like the enmeshed Lion, snared in his strong hold—with his dark eyes sternly rivetted upon the door, through which Copely had passed; his right hand thrust up to the elbow, into his bosom; the left, clenched, and resting, motionless, upon the table. I shook as I saw him. Was he baffled? or were we? It were hard to tell. He was the least moved of the three. Copely had known him twenty years before, intimately, I believe; but, now, he cut him away, with one blow, from his heart, as if he had been something deadly and hateful; vegetation, sprouting in its heat—verdant, with the verdure of a stagnant pool—bright, with the brightness, only of corruption. But let me return—to the revolution. `Are you much acquainted in the city,' said Copely to Archibald—as they rode on, toward Philadelphia. `No—I was never there but once,' was the reply. `Ah!' exclaimed Copely, contracting his forehead. `But your brother—he has been there more than once.' There was something in his manner, that I never liked; but his way of saying this, was inexpressibly provoking to me. `Yes, Sir,' said I, riding up to him, and putting my hand upon his horse's mane—looking him steadily in the face, all the time—`Yes Sir! his brother has been there, more than once.' `Twice, I believe,' said the imperetrable being. `Oh, you colour,' said Archibald, smiling—`what is the meaning of this?' `He can answer you best,' said Copely, reining up, to let me pass him. `I leave it to him.' I was exceedingly nettled at this manner of proceeding; it was too haughty, cold and forbidding. `Sir,' said I. `Nonsense, brother,' cried Archibald, leaping between us. `I will have no quarrelling, where I am. You are enemies to each other, from ignorance. I would have taken some pains, before, to reconcile you; but I knew that it would be a troublesome affair; and, as you could not often meet, I have put it off. You know me, Chester; and you too, brother. Each had cause enough, if he could read the others heart, to cut his throat. But, both are mistaken in the origin of the feud. Shake hands like men. Let us jog on quietly to the city; and, I hold myself pledged, when I return, to make you love each other, more heartily than either of you now love me. What say you? are you the men to forbear for three or four days?' Copely stopped short, in the middle of the road; looked at my brother; and then, at me, for several moments—as if—though his countenance changed not —and my heart, upon my word, felt, as if it had been drifting about in a cold rain, for a week, drenched and soaked through—chilled. At last, he deliberately drew off his glove. `Oadley,' said he, giving me his hand. `I have wronged you. There is my hand; I believe you brother. It is his fault, that we have not been friends before; had he defended you, ever before, as he has, now, I should have been a different man toward you?' I took his hand, wondering what he meant, yet—(I cannot deny it), gratified, to the very heart, with the proud, frank courage of the man. `I do not ask you,' said I, `what are the circumstances to which you allude, now—' `I observe it,' said he. Archibald smiled, and stooped over his horse's neck to conceal it. `But,' continued Copely. `I must tell you what they are. Ride on Major, ride on; we will overtake you, in a few minutes.' Archibald threw up, in a fine martial style, and cantered ahead. `You were once rather intimate with a woman.'— My heart was in my throat. `For, a woman she was, even at the age of childhood —a passionate, enthusiastick creature, a—in short, you knew Ellen Sampson.' I had expected another name; and felt, with a bitter disappointment, a deadly sickness at the heart. `You look very pale,' said he—in the same tone of voice. `Do you know what has become of her?' `No,' I replied. `For a year, I have not heard.' `Should you desire to know?' I bowed. `And of her brother—father?' `Yes,' I replied, wondering at the minuteness—and emphasis of his enquiry. `He is—the brother, I mean—a wanderer;—his sister is dying of a broken heart; the father is ready to dip his hands in your blood, wherever he can meet you—and—' `Heaven and earth!—' I cried, in unaffected astonishment, `what have I done, to merit this!' `What done!—Look at me Oadley, stately and cold as you are—honest, as you appear to be—have you not broken the heart of one proud girl—wantonly, and like a child—visited another—I do not ask you how, nor where—with.' There was a pause—(of deep emotion, I should have said—but for the nature of the man.) In another it would have been emotion. In him it was not. `Ellen Sampson is my half cousin. You are startled. I doomed you to death, before I had seen you;— I came to your tent. I would have slain you; but a similarity of manner led me to make the attempt upon Archibald—I attacked him with a sword.' `Gracious God!' I cried—looking at the man, in amazement. `Yes,' he continued. `I had never seen either of you, I had heard only the name. I rode to your quarters. I belonged to Gates' army, and left it early when Morgan arrived, in consequence of a quarrel with Arnold; and it was then, that I heard of Ellen's shame.' `Her shame!—what mean you? As I live, Copely, there is some mistake in this.' `Silence!' said he, `hear me out. I left the Northern army—came here—sought out your brother—led him abroad, one clear star light evening—insulted him—fought, and was disabled; nay, should have been slain, had not an accidental interference given me time to discover that I was mistaken in him; and, at the same time, to show him that the lady, of whom I had been speaking, was not, as he had misunderstood me to mean, Miss Arnauld.' `Miss Arnauld?' said I faintly. `No—Miss Lucia Arnauld'—he replied. `This led to an explanation; we agreed not to mention the affair; and your brother extorted a promise from me not to assail you, till I had given him notice. While I was yet on the point of bringing the matter to an issue;— for it was enough to drive any man mad, who doated on a woman, as I did on cousin Nell, to see her wasting away, like a struck flower—I—I—(his voice did falter now—by heaven it did!)—I saw Nick, a desperate creature, though one of the best hearted monsters, in all this world, running about the camp. I was a good deal alarmed; but, owing to an ugly affair (raising his left arm, and compressing his lips, as if with extreme pain) that had happened a few nights before I saw him, I was prevented from pursuing the matter—do you know your brother?' `I do not understand you,' said I. `Is'nt he,' (laying his fore finger upon his forehead) `a little—a very little touched here?—don't smile. I think so. I have asked him; but he denies it. I'll tell you why I think so.' `Why,' said I—pained by his strange levity, not of manner, but of thought, inexpressibly pained—`why.' `In confidence then, I will—You do not know him well. He is mad, very mad. He loves Lucia Arnauld; rein up, will you—would you ride over him? She loves him to death and distraction. Yet—he set my heart in such a blaze, that,' (he breathed very hard for a while, and then continued) `I was fool enough to hunt her up, and attempt—accursed driveller, that I was!—to win a way into her proud spirit.—I failed. She loves Archibald—and him only; and he, O, that men will trample on what would give lustre and fragrance to a death bed!—he shuts up his eyes, and turns his back upon her—Hey!—prick up—let us join. You know all.' As he said this, he dashed along side of Archibald, and left me to my meditations. My knee was quite painful—and I felt unwilling to trot, until the pain had subsided. `This then,' said I, `is the secret; this accounts for the mortal anxiety, that I have always felt in that man's society. He was the messenger of evil to me; and my soul cowered in his presence, instinctively.' I looked at him. He sat his horse, just as he did every thing else, like a creature of great strength, slumbering in his own security. All that he did was of the same character; if his hand fell upon yours— though by accident, you felt that, it wanted but the will in him, to give it a momentum, that would have crushed your's, bone and joint, so, when he spoke;— he opened his mouth, and his heart ran out, like a current dammed up,—and ready, at his bidding, to waste and thunder, like the spring tide, and swollen rivers of our country, loaded with ice, and foam, and blackened with wreck and ruin. I looked at Archibald—and wondered at the great manhood of his countenance. It wore yet all the fiery intrepidity, but none of the sullenness or melancholy of his youth. It was now the face of wisdom and deep thought, sorrowful, dim, and lofty. His very port too, diminutive as was his stature, had an indescribable stateliness and majesty in it. It was difficult to believe, when he was walking, or riding, that he was only five feet six inches in height. Yet he was no more—though tall men have stood like boys before him. Nay, he was not yet twenty two; and there was that in his eyes, (for calamity and thought are severe chasteners), which a man of thirty, deeply tried in the wisdom of the world, and wrenched again and again, in its concussions, should not have been ashamed of. In short, he was a lordly looking fellow—fuller of genius than Copely; but not so full of dominion. I looked upon them, followed them, listened to them, with pleasure: wondering, all the day long, at the patience and greatness of Archibald—his forbearance, when assailed—first in life, and then in love. This accounted for their testimony; his distress, agony, unutterable agony, when Copely returned unmarried. I remember it all now; it rushed in upon me, like a volume of pictured light—a vapour full of population, loveliness, and variety. Nay, why not speak of myself? I was no longer the same man. I was more thoughtful, devout; and I do believe, a better man now, than when I joined the army. Arthur had made me so. `We must throw off here, awhile,' said Copely, turning, and calling to me, just as the evening wind began to blow in our faces; while they turned aside from the main road, and I followed. `Are you for an adventure, brother,' said Archibald —turning about in the saddle, and leaning, with one hand upon the crupper—till I had come up with him. `With all my heart?' I replied. `What is it.' `Hush! hush! walk your horses'—said Copely, in a whisper. `See to your arms. Follow me.' VOL. II. 8 We did follow him, in a dead silence, for more than an hour, through a wilderness of beauty and damp greenness. `Now! now,'—he said, coming out, suddenly, upon a circular, green, turf flat,—while the stars broke down upon us, all at once, as it appeared to me, emerging I suppose, from the darkness of the wood. `Now! tread softly.' `There was an air of seriousness in his manner—and yet, a dash of pleasantry. But Archibald looked troubled; he did not understand it, I saw; and, when Copely fired off a pistol, suddenly, as we sat—he started, as if it had gone through his head. In two minutes however, a fowling piece (as I judged, from the whistling sound), was fired at a great distance, on some hill; and a horn or conch shell began to wind, very pleasantly, upon the wind. `Forward!' cried Copely, dashing over the green, at full speed, with Archibald at his heels, `forward.' We soon came to a beautiful farm house, built of stone, substantial and large, with every room in it lighted. `Another wedding!' said I, carelessly, but with more meaning than I was ready to avow. Archibald dropped the reins, and tried to speak---I saw that he did---for he caught Copely's arm; and, after awhile, repeated it---as if---poor fellow---he knew not what he said. Copely threw himself from the saddle, fastened his horse to part of a Virginia fence, projecting over a ruinous stone wall, overgrown with coloured shrubbery; and, motioning to us to follow his example, led us round the dwelling, to a place where we could see, through a fall of thick white curtains, and a half closed window shutter, the motion and bustle of several persons; women and children, as it appeared, by their shadow. `Stop Copely,' said Archibald, grasping his arm— `what are you about? who are there? Have you any surprise for us?' `Yes,' he replied. `What is it!' said Archibald. `Follow me, and you shall see.' He tapped at the door, which instantly opened, and, at the first step, a young woman threw herself into his arms, sobbing and clinging to him, like a delirious creature. `O, Chester! Chester!' she cried. I staggered at the sound. A sudden giddiness and darkness rushed upon me; and Archibald, who stood like a statue for a moment, caught my hands, in silence. Just then, the fire flashed broadly out; and I saw the yellow tresses of one that I knew—bound up now, like coiled gold, in a more womanly fashion—and a white forehead, transparent as the broad magnolia leaf, resting against the bosom of Copely. I felt relieved— unaccountably relieved at the sight; for I knew not what strange fancy had possessed me for a moment; or, rather, I am ashamed to tell. At that moment, another female passed me, as coming from the open air. `O, no!' she articulated faintly— `he is not there.' `Mary, dear Mary,' I cried,—embracing the sweet innocent. She was beautiful—with that patient, lovely, humble loveliness, which awes the stern man. `Archibald,' she cried, breaking away from me. `O, Archibald, we have not met since—since'—she could not utter another word—she was choking. `No, dear Mary,' he answered, pressing her wet forehead, with his lips, `but let us forget that—look up, cousin, look up! upon my word, you are an altered woman—and if he—poor Arthur!' She caught Archibald's hand to her lips, looking all the time into his face, with streaming eyes—as if dying to ask some question, but dreading to hear the answer. Archibald anticipated her—while he stood, as in a trance, before the bashful woman, so full of love, and love's inquietude, that every limb was eloquent with expression. `Dear Mary, I cannot speak to you yet. You have taken my breath away,' said he—`I should not have known you. Nay, do not blush; let me retain your hand; am I not your cousin? O, I understand you. Yes—he is well—very well—and—ah, how deadly pale you are! hark! (in a whisper)—he will be here, to-morrow.' The poor girl was overpowered—and would have fallen, in the sweet tumult that followed, had not Archibald caught her, and gently led her to a seat, where she and he sat, wondering at each other, in speechless admiration. I stood in the shadow all the while—the door was open; and, when Mary left me, I stepped back into the entry, unwilling to intrude upon them, and unable to think steadily for myself. Mary sat looking him in the eyes, directly facing me—her gentle lips just moving, now and then, as if her heart were stirred, and they stirred with it—the bright tears running down her cheeks, drop after drop; her mild eyes wide open, and overflowing with lustre. `You tell me Archibald, that I am altered—but you! Oh, your own mother would not know you. You were always a proud boy; but, you look prouder than ever. I cannot talk, I am too happy to talk—I—my heart is too full. I had a thousand things to say to you—to ask you—but, dear Archibald—I cannot remember any thing but that you are here—alive—and strong— and that I have not seen you for many a year—and—' Just then, the beautiful apparition that had fallen upon the neck of Copely, in the deep, awful, hushed expression of devout tenderness, lifted her head, and dwelt, with her eyes shut, and head turned aside, as if in prayer, upon the bosom, against which her young cheek leant; again and again, had I seen her pale orbs opening for a moment—upon his—that lightened over them; and then, a convulsive, involuntary pressure would follow; and she would sink down again, as if--- altogether too happy for expression---and too weak to conceal her happiness. I felt a pang—I cannot deny it. It was humiliating to be so utterly overlooked; and, for a moment, I forgot that Mary Austin had seen me, many times since she had seen Archibald, who had been her school fellow from the cradle, till about a year or two before the inroad of the Hessians;—and that Ellen Sampson—the spiritualized Ellen Sampson—was the cousin of him, upon whose manly bosom she was leaning. But I could forbear no longer. I stepped forward, into the light, and met her eyes—just as she was raising them, once more, with a renewed thoughtfulness—and a deepening hue; for they seemed at first, so strangly pale were they, to have discharged their colour and brightness with their tears. She saw me. A swift paleness, like a blast, covered her face instantly. Her eyes shut, and she fainted dead away, in his arms. Copely looked at me—not fiercely—not in sorrow—but like a judge, holding the power of life and death, in his hands. I moved not, I stirred not—till I saw her lips parting; and then, I took her hand gently, and hung over her, as she lay with her head in the lap of an elderly woman,---whom I had never seen. Copely did not reprove me; but a strong hand caught at my arm---yet, I heeded it not— nay, though I knew the voice that muttered in my ear to be that of the brother that had stolen upon me, sleeping; and knew not but he might hold his hand uplifted, at the moment—yet I never turned my head; nay, though I felt the disordered glancing of an old man, whom I had seen before, but heeded not—while he hobbled toward me, with his parched lips moving with a malediction—I heeded them not. And, when she opened her eyes, and attempted to raise herself, I observed that she did not appear terrified, as with the apparition of something hateful—Oh! no! but every moment, as her collectedness returned, the early flashing of her spirit returned with it—and she almost—the dear capricious creature—almost smiled, as she carried my hand, at last, passionately to her lips. Copely had held one of her's, till that moment; but, then, he dropped it—why, I could not imagine,—was he not her cousin? had he not loved another? Yet—by heaven, the man shook from head to foot, as I could see, by his shadow upon the wall, or—`Oh! it must be,' VOL. II. 8* I thought; `it is only the flickering of the fire light— the shadow may quiver—but Chester Copely cannot.' I was mistaken. He came to me—took my hand—and her's; looked at us for a moment, as if subduing some swell at his heart, by main force; and then, spoke, as follows. `Do I understand you both?' `No,' said Ellen. `No,' said Mary—both at the same moment. `No!' cried Archibald. `No!' said Nicholas. `No, no, no!' said the old man, tottering to his seat. It was like the continued echo of many uninhabited, desolate places. `Hush, hush!' cried Ellen—starting upon her feet; throwing back her banner of hair, that had fallen all about her, in disorder—and recovering, instantaneously, all her ancient frolicksomeness of expression. `You are all mistaken—all! all! You, Chester, in particular—so, don't scowl. But take a hint, while you may. Don't leave a maiden, `all forlorn,' offended, and alone—where she may meet with as handsome a fellow as that,' (pointing to me.) I was thunderstruck at her vivacity. `You had well nigh lost me. Ask him all about it. He may tell you. Yet—it was not his fault—no, (more seriously, and with an emphasis that thrilled to my very heart)—I—I might have loved him—nay, why should I not tell the truth? I did love him better then, than I could have loved you. Your cold—why how black you all look. I am not mad; no, upon my honour, I am not. You were too cold, and haughty, and repulsive; and, when you left me—it was—O, Chester, not as a man should leave a young sensible heart, that he would hold in his, forever, and ever. But, you do not know what you owe to that young man. Perhaps—but no, he may tell you. If he will not, I will.' `One word, Nell,' said Copely, in the same tone— while she laid her pretty hand upon his heart, and shook her head, maliciously, as if to say—speak as you will, look as you will, this cannot be mistaken again. `Do you love him?' She coloured, dropped her hand, described a circle in the sanded floor, with her toe; and then, while I stood breathless before her, answered—`yes'—looking him up in the face, at the same time, with a beautiful confusion, that—hang me, if I could persuade myself that I was at the bottom of— `O, Ellen!' said Copely, embracing her, `that is enough. I understand you. God forever bless you, my girl!—now I understand you—your tears—paleness. Enough, Nell—enough.' She laughed, snapped her fingers---and then cried--- her red lips parting with suppressed laughter, and her eyes running over at the same time. `Now prisoner, look up. It's now my turn; nay, no flinching.' Copely almost smiled; but raised his eyes only, without speaking. `Do you? Mr. Oadley keep an eye on your brother —Nick, a glass of cold water—there! all ready— aim! Chester Copely do you—lord! if you won't look me in the face, I won't speak at all. Do you love Lucia Arnauld?' At that name, Archibald moved back a step---drew a breath, that appeared to shatter his chest;---his nostrils dilated, and he half raised his hands as if to cover his face; and then dashed them away, as if indignant at his own want of self command. `Love her!' said Copely---`Yes, better than any thing beneath that firmament.' `Oh!' said Ellen, half terrified at the earnest, lofty expression of his voice. `Except,' locking her hands in his, and smiling. O! I never saw such a smile upon the lips of man; nay, nor of woman; nay, nor upon the unsullied innocent lips of the newly born---it was all truth and purity. `And will you forgive me for the trick?' `The devil! was it you, you Ellen!' said Copely, a little angry. `I half suspected it before; but, then, as I thought that you had forgotten me, I gave up the notion. Yes, I do forgive you. But, you put me into a desperate affair. I believed the letter---and went, on the night appointed, to be married. Does she know it?' `No. From that hour to this, she has regarded you, as far less presumptuous than you appeared. The only thing that worries her, is, that you wrote to her, instead of asking her, for her answer. It would have saved you a long ride.'</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER VI. `I can fix nothing further of my thought, `Save that I longed for thee, and sought for thee, `In all these agonies;—and woke, and found thee.' `Brother,' said I, as I entered our lodging room, the night after our arrival at Philadelphia, and found him rising from his devotions, `what is the meaning of this? what disturbs you?' It was some minutes before he was able to reply; and, when he did, it was in a manner unusually solemn. `There are many things, my brother, to weigh down the pride of my heart. I am ashamed of many things; afraid of many, that I have been proud of, too long, and set too frequently at naught. The blood of Clinton is upon me. It is in vain to deny it. I am wretched. I never shall be otherwise. Though I were to wash my heart away in my own tears, the blood would be there yet, mingled with the minutest atom. It is in vain to reason. Even Copely, the stern, unyielding, dispassionate and inscrutable Copely---he has never slept soundly, since he slew a man. Why this is, it would be hard to tell. We have slain many a brave fellow in the field; many better men than Clinton; or the major. Yet, for all that they, or their troubled spirits may do, we are happy. This is one thing; another is---that I, and you too, brother, have not been, to a desolate and bereaved parent---a widowed mother, what we should have been. It is in vain to deny it, John. We have left our mother, in the house of a stranger, at the mercy of a stranger. This, I cannot believe, is required of us. Heaven never will demand a sacrifice so unnatural. I have thought much of it. One of us must go to her, and dwell with her. You, from the patience of your temper—and being lame, you are the one. However, let us think more of it. I am willing to take my chance. It is too much for her poor heart, to be left, husbandless, childless, houseless—in her old age.' `Not houseless—brother, another dwelling has been erected.' `Upon the embers of the old! Think you that our mother can even sleep in it?—As well might she slumber in the churchyard, where death and dishonor, had gone their rounds; and all that she most loved lay interred.' `Brother,' said I—`let us never speak of this.— We have understood each other well enough hitherto.— That scene must never be thought of.' `True—let us forget it. That has led to this alienation. Gracious God!—father and son—husband and children!—turning upon her, the broken hearted woman, when she is most in need of consolation—oh, my brother.' We embraced—and I determined, from that moment, to return to my dear mother, and be dutiful to her, whatever became of my country. `And Copely,' said I hesitating—`I—.' `I understand you,' replied Archibald, with a look of deep distress. `The thing is all explained; a bitter and terrible misunderstanding it has been. He loved Lucia, because I loved her; because she was like himself, and chiefly because Ellen appeared to have forgotten him, and attached herself, heart and soul, to you. And she—the rash, thoughtless girl, glorying in her own disinterestedness and magnanimity—went, bound with flowers, to martyrdom, in the hope of promoting his happiness. It would be idle to detail the series of wild, extravagant inventions, by which she brought Copely to declare himself to—to—(he coughed, with great emphasis—and I knew well what it was for—he could not pronounce her name, and was willing to make me believe that a sudden fit of coughing was the reason—but no, the impediment was in his heart,) `to Miss Arnauld.' `Not Miss Arnauld,' said I, smiling. `Well, then,' he replied, a little impatiently, and colouring, `Miss Lucia.' `Not Miss Lucia,' said I. `Damn it, brother!—why will you make me swear? Lucia then, Lucia Arnauld!—will that do?' `Why—a—yes,' I replied, imitating the frigid manner of Copely. `This declaration was by a letter—and, just after his own nature, abrupt, frank, and peremptory. The answer came—giving him reason enough, I confess, for I saw it, to believe that he would be a bridegroom. It was a childish affair; but with all its childness, has been wonderfully well arranged; and we have reason to believe that—that—Lucia—ahem!—does not know, to this hour, aught of Copely's design in visiting her, in his new uniform, at the time that he did! I could smile at his disappointment and mortification, were he not such a noble creature; and, did I not know that he sought her, less for his own sake, than for her's, and mine.' `For your's!—how?' `Yes, for mine. I knew her excellence. I knew that she was capable of making such a man as Chester Copely happy, beyond all other men—proud and happy. Our tempers were alike, his and mine, I mean— unostentatious, deeply, inwardly devout and affectionate, but seeking concealment rather than display. If she could love me, therefore, she might love him. Beside, he was the greater man, the stouter heart, the steadier —. And, if he could love Ellen Sampson, despite of all her waywardness and caprice, for her high, heroick nature, ardent temper, enthusiasm, and sensibility, how much more would he love a creature, that, with all these great qualities, had none of her girlish, quick frivolity—I do not speak of her caprice. Both are capricious; but both, I do believe, now, less from a natural inconstancy of temper, than from pride and pique—willing to sacrifice themselves, and impatient for it too, that they may rend and tear a heart, that, to their thought, has been too insensible of its approximation to theirs—ah!' `Dress! dress! there's not a moment to lose!' said Copely, striking the door open, with his arm, and standing before us, with an expression that I never saw in his face before. `Go with me! they are carrying all before them.' `Who? what do you mean?' said we, both at once. `Lucia and Clara—and—Arthur arrived last night; and I set off directly. The house was, as that romping Ellen says, getting too hot to hold us all.' `Can I believe my ears,' said I. `Has Chester Copely caught the versatility, and —' `I know what you would say,' recovering himself; `Yes, I have caught it! I have no disposition to deny it. There is a strange affinity between us, growing out of contradictory materials.' `What a result might be expected,' said Archibald, half smiling, `from a chymical combination of two such hearts. But, soberly, dear Chester, what are you driving at?' `Soberly then—dress yourselves in your handsomeest. I will call for you, within an hour.' `Within an hour!' said Archibald; `wait ten minutes, and I will go with you.' `And you! can you equip yourself as quickly,' said he, to me. `Yes,' said Archibald, even for the battle—ten minutes are enough for John, devotions and all.' `I dare say so,' said Copely, gravely. `So with Frederick of Prussia: he made his men pray, by beat of drum. At the first tap, they knelt; at the second, prayed; at the third, rose. And if any man presumed to be devout, one second beyond the time; or, if he did not keep time in his devotion, he was lashed to the halberds.' In a very few minutes, we were on our way. He led us to a large mansion—blazing with lights. My heart beat deliriously, and I could hardly hold myself up, as we approached it. `I am very faint,' said Archibald; `is this Mr. Arnauld's?' `No!' said Copely, `this is Mr. Patten's.' We were soon upon the landing. `Stop!' said Copely; `remember where you are. All eyes are upon you. You go under my introduction. Trust to me; and remember that you will meet some women who could shake the stoutest heart in our camp; some men—some officers of the enemy, out on parole; and not a few, who know a good deal of our history. Heads up!' Ere I could get my breath, I found myself, standing in the middle of a large room, with Archibald, leaning on my arm, and every seat occupied; the walls studded with eyes and lips; and all about me, a mortal silence. I thought that I should fall to the earth, particularly when I heard a voice that I knew, even in a whisper. A dark mist went over my eyes, and I was fain to catch at Copely's arm. `For shame!' said he, in a low voice; `shall we deserve their upbraiding? Remember that you are an American officer.' We threw out our chests on the spot; and trod outward like princes. Lucia Arnauld was the first person that I saw! She gave me her hand, instantly, without the least appearance of embarrassment, though I scarcely dared to lift my eyes to her face; and was afraid, at every rustle near me, that the apparition of another would start up. The silence was insupportable—cruel. How could human beings so sport with the sensibilities of a soldier? Where was their humanity? `Talk,' said Lucia, in a whisper, taking my arm, `say something—any thing, and let us walk.' I did so, and our example was soon followed. I heard a step—I lifted my eyes. It was she! She was VOL. II. 9 pale as death; but her beauty was awful. Her movement was full of self possession:—and—yes, it was sorrow! that sorrow, which none might presume to comfort. We continued our walking, with an occasional broken, incoherent question, until I had sufficiently recovered to look about me. I was not a little struck, at the arrangement that we had fallen into, whether by design or accident. There stood Archibald, leaning upon the mantel piece, fronting the capricious, wild Ellen, about whom, a score of fellows had gathered, their eyes dancing an accompaniment to her voice. There was a dazzling air about her—a blinding atmosphere; the transparent changeableness of her complexion; the vivid brightness of her singularly faint eyes; her glittering hair—and, altogether she was, to my view, something spiritual. Archibald appeared very absent; and she, I could perceive, was malicious enough to observe it. In another part of the room, went Copely and Clara, in deep conversation; was she listening to him? I believed not, for, as she passed along, at the further extremity of the room, he relinquished her arm, for a moment, to join Ellen, beckoning Archibald to go up to Clara; but Clara did not seem to perceive the absence of one, nor the approach of the other; and I—while I was looking at her, and wondering if the tall, queenly creature, whose very step was full of dominion, could possibly be the same that had once leaned, overpowered, upon my shoulder, and sobbed there, as if she were dying. She stood, as in a revery; but, raising her eyes a moment, they encountered mine, and she turned them away, with a quickness that went, like electricity, through my heart. Yes! she was thinking of me; and she started, when she lifted up her eyes, and saw mine fixed upon her, as if my apparition had stood suddenly before her. And then, for I could not take my eyes from her, she blushed all over; why? with shame and vexation, that she had betrayed herself—so like a child—by musing, absence; and, quickness when caught. She awoke, therefore, all at once, and entered into conversation, headlong, as if—poor Clara! to retrieve what she had lost. `That man!' said Copely—coming up to us. `Do you know him?' `There was no embarrassment in his manner; and, when he bowed to Lucia, it was with an expression of deep reverence, and, I hardly knew what else to call it—it was not pity, nor compassion, but something of sorrow and sympathy. Her lips trembled, and she gave him her hand; but, would have withdrawn it, I am sure, had she seen Archibald's face at the moment.' `No,' said, Lucia—`I do not know him, and have no desire to know him. Do you, Ellen?' (addressing the sprightly creature, who came forward, half on tip toe, at that moment, while Copely fell back, to enjoy the luxury of contemplation; and I saw his fine eyes roving over her round beautiful waist, delicate feet, and voluptuous bosom, with the feeling of a husband, sanctified, and delighted.) `Whom?' said Ellen, tapping her gently on the arm, `that elegant fellow?' `Yes, that elegant fellow,' said Copely, dwelling on her words, with some emphasis. `He is a scoundrel; and—' `Hush, Hotspur,' said Ellen, quickly—`Hush! I see powder burning in your eyes; and forty thousand small swords in the blaze. Don't quarrel; there, there, stand back, I will send him about his business directly?' Copely smiled; bit his lip, at the beautiful tyrant, and stepped back. The stranger was, certainly, one of the most elegant men that I ever saw. In his manner, voice, step, action, every thing, there was an air of high fashion, that I had never seen before; and a dash of pleasant profligate ease, that had been new to me, till I saw Mr. Arnauld. I listened to him a moment, until I found him engaged in a playful repartee with Ellen, who manifested an astonishing readiness. But still, her's was not the manner to check his impudent, graceful familiarity; but, that of Lucia was. Hide it as he would, he dared no further encroachment upon that quarter. Ellen saw it, and urged him to repeat his invitation. He had just offered his hand to Lucia for a walk; but she put it back, with a manner that left him no hope—and yet, left him nothing to complain of. `O, no,' he replied, to Ellen, `no—the law of gallantry, as well as modesty, will prevent a renewal of the solicitation.' `Modesty,' said Ellen, smiling, `whose modesty?' He put his hand, gently—it was a beautiful hand— upon his own heart, and bowed. The eye of Lucia said—`puppy,' as plainly as ever eye spoke in this world. `Upon my word, Mr. Bosworth (the name of the stranger) you have disordered some of the definitions in my mind, exceedingly, by that gesture; I had always taken modesty to be—' `Not exactly synonymous with—ahem!' laying his hand again on his heart. `Not exactly,' she replied, pleasantly. `O,' he continued, with a careless swinging of the arm, `I was always reckoned remarkable for my timidity and bashfulness—quite a wonder—from a boy.' `You are so, yet, Mr. Bosworth,' was the reply. `I dare say so—my own mother used to say that I was the most retiring and bashful of her boys.' `You were an only son,' I presume. `Upon my word, Miss Sampson I, I—would stake my reputation on—' `On what?' said she, pressing him, with a little bitterness. `On any thing that you please'—said the libertine, endeavouring to get released from a strife, which was becoming altogether too keen for his play. `I dare say so,' said Ellen, promptly—`and be glad to lose the stake.' He coloured, and would have replied, sharply, I believe, had he not caught the look of Copely, at that moment, and turned dark in the face. The eyes of all the company followed his. Copely advanced, leisurely, up to him; and, touching his arm, walked toward the door; poor Ellen looking as if she would fall to the earth. There they stopped, a moment; the look of Copely was menacing. He pointed to the door. The other hesitated. Copely waited a moment, stamped with his foot; and, I believe, would have seized him by the collar, if the other had not dodged it, and passed through the door. Copely then returned, liesurely, to the same spot; and, all the company crowded about us—asking, with eager eyes and pale lips, `Who is he? what is he?' `The servant of an English lord,' said Copely. There was a general exclamation of astonishment and disbelief. `It is true,' said he—`and there goes another; see what company (raising his voice) we are brought into, by our unthinking hospitality. I saw that fellow once, in Quebec. I was sure of it. He robbed his master soon after; and, the moment that I met his eyes fairly, he betrayed the symptoms of guilt. Then, mistaking my forbearance for doubt, or timidity, he began to deny it, and to resist; and, when we had arrived at the door, he recovered his self possession, all at once, and attempted to face it out. But, he is gone. Our hospitality is dishonoured, our daughters—' `Alas! poor Henrietta! poor Henrietta! What will become of her!' exclaimed a dozen voices, at the same moment, while a beautiful girl, whom I had seen upon the arm of Bosworth an hour before, fainted away. `Who is she?' said I, to Lucia. `Infatuated girl!' she uttered, in a low voice. `She never loved him; but, the wretch told such magnificent VOL. II. 9* lies about his family, rents, and equipage, that her brain was turned. `Yes,' said Ellen, colouring with shame, at the self inflicted lesson of her own heart—but endeavouring to carry it off, `it was the carriage and four that conquered her. And now that the carriage and four have gone—Lord! this accounts for what he said—that he drove a coach and four. I dare say that he told the truth, after all—he walked so like a coachman.' A general laugh followed this observation—and she continued, conscious that Copely's eyes were upon her, `I would send her a tin carriage and four, to trundle about in her dressing room; that would be a consolation—I—' Copely's eyes were upon her; and her's filled instantly. Her head fell, abashed, at her own upbraiding; and, her voice died away; and, as soon as she could, she crept up to him, where he stood, with a serious face, meditating, as it seemed, upon what had passed. `It was very childish,' said she, slipping her hand into his, so that nobody could see it, except Lucia and I—`I—I—forgive me Chester.' I saw him press her hand—and turn toward her, with his heart in his face. But he said nothing—yet he looked, plainer than any language could speak—`Say what you will; do what you will; rally servants, or lacerate the broken hearted, I cannot be angry with you.' `You are very absent,' said Lucia, to me with a mournful smile. `Am I?' `Have you spoken to Clara?' `To—to Clara?' said I—not knowing what was to become of me. `You have not, I believe,' said she—`will you?' I lifted my eyes to her's; they were beautifully bright, her's I mean: yet there was a solemn darkness in their centre, as if—as if death had extinguished a jewel there. I was silent a moment, and then said— `You have not seen Archibald' (I felt a convulsive contraction of her arm—) `will you see him?' `Yes!' she answered, firmly—`yes, if you will recollect yourself, and meet Clara. She has not forgtten you.' `But when?' said I. `Leave that to me,' she replied. `We will withdraw early. You'll go with me; I will take care that Archibald—your brother—shall attend her. I want to see you. And my father and mother desire to see him. But, do not mistake me. I am prouder than ever. What I do, now, is the extent that I shall ever do. Let Archibald and Lucia be friends. They can never be any thing more. Tell him this. If he have the strength, the forbearance, to be content with that, we will renew our acquaintance. But if he have any doubt, any hope, beyond that—let us never meet again. I am firm.' `I will speak to him this moment,' said I, strangely affected at her solemnity, and distressed at her agitation. I announced the commission. He heard me through— the sweat started out upon his forehead—`noble, excellent girl,' he said—`I will; lead me to her.' I brought him up. `I accept your conditions, Lucia,' said he—and she gave him her hand. When they touched—I felt my blood thrill. They were like too dead creatures, suddenly galvanised. `Let us go; I have much to say to you,' said Lucia— `Colonel Copely, give your arm to sister—Mr. Oadley, you'll attend to cousin Ellen.' The order of march thus arranged, we descended to the carriages; but there, a new difficulty arose; and, finally, I knew not how it was, I found myself sitting on the same seat with Clara, her hand in mine—her head upon my shoulder. I held my lips to her forehead —I bathed her whole face with my tears—and was endeavouring, for we were alone in the carriage, to raise her pale face, so that the lanterns would show me her features. She was motionless—she had fainted. I burst open the door—leaped to the ground—took her into my arms, and was hurrying into the first house, when I saw a man at a distance, whom I knew to be a watchman. He ran to me, and, after a few moments, she recovered; but, when I proposed entering the carriage, she resisted, faintly, but positively. `No,' said she, `let us walk. It is a beautiful night, and I have much to say to you. Let us walk.' I assented, and we continued our ramble for half an hour, in one of the most delicious nights that ever breathed upon the forehead of man. There was a firmament, full of blue eyes, all over us. I could not have uttered a word, had it been to obtain my own salvation. We had come at length, to a little low railing, and were walking, steadily and silently, by it, when the temptation to sit gave me courage, and I led her to it. We sat down, but still I was unable to speak. She was agitated to her finger's ends. And I—I was running over all my thought and dreaming again. The proud creature was again within my power. `I—Clara!' said I, faintly; `speak to me; you have not forgotten me; what troubles you?' Her bosom heaved audibly; and her breath was like one suffocating. She arose—she stood up; and when, just as I had done at our last meeting, I put my arm round her waist, and beheld her bright eyes waning in her tears—she did not rebuke me. My heart felt—O, I cannot describe it—giddy and faint with rapture. `Clara, dear Clara,' said I, more tenderly, holding her soft hands to my forehead. `I knew not,' said she, at last, recovering some degree of composure, `what my true nature was. I never shall know, I fear. Two hours ago, no mortal breathing could have made me believe, that, after many years, it would be possible for me to stand by a man, with his arm encircling me, who had so blighted and trodden on me;—I—I—' Her tears fell, like rain, upon my hands. I arose, and pressed her, convulsively to my bosom. `Nay Clara,' said I, `let there be no reproach or recrimination between us, now. Our meeting is but for a few hours. We may never meet again.' (I felt her dear arms contract, and her bosom heaving against mine.) `Else, might I say—why was I trodden on—why was I blighted, heart and soul?' `O, Mr. Oadley—we have been much to blame. Both have been too proud for our own happiness. I thought that I was able to live and die, proudly, as I have lived; but I cannot. I doubted you. You could have quieted me. A word, a look would have done it.' `We have been mightily abused; my own, my inexpressibly dear girl. It was pride—I grant it. I weep for it. I should have told you, as I can now, that, I never wronged you—never, at least, till after our separation.' `Ah!' said she, raising her head. `Then all that I have heard is true. Hear me. I love you, more than life. I have wept myself nearly blind since our parting. I have became convinced of your innocence, and exceedingly penitent.' `Of my innocence! is it possible!' said I, `then why not tell me so.' `What! would you marry a woman that should pursue you to the camp, with entreaty? No, I would sooner have died a thousand deaths. But I honoured you—almost worshipped you; and I trembled at the same time. I felt that I had wronged you; but how had you borne it? carelessly—carelessly, Oadley; leaving me to die, a broken hearted woman. O— I cannot speak any more. But hear me, no matter what has happened. I can forgive it all—forget it all —except that—give me your hand Oadley. Do you love me yet?' `Upon my soul, Clara, ten thousand times more than ever!' I exclaimed. `Well then—one more question. I put it to your truth and honour. Are you worthy of me?' `No—I am not—not altogether worthy of you.'— Her arms dropped; `but, nothing has happened, since we met last, that I am ashamed to tell you. I have been weak, love; vain, very vain, but not criminal. There is my hand. I dare to offer it to you. Dare you receive it?' She took it; and then, were we indeed, with our eyes lifted to heaven, and all streaming with the flow of the heart—then, were we, indeed, a betrothed pair, wedded before God and all his angels, in the warm, beautiful air. `Now then,' said Clara, receiving my kiss, like a bride, her nuptial ben ediction, `now then, I am prepared to die. Let us go. But O, my friend, let us be more patient and forbearing hereafter. Think of what we have suffered—done—endured.' We finished our walk in silence, with a holy, deep, passionate tranquillity; such, I do believe, as the married feel, when all their apprehension and sorrow are hushed; and no mortal arm can pluck them asunder; and the murmur of their first embrace; the passionate heaving of their youthful hearts, hath subsided for the first time, like a blue summer sea, in the moonlight. We found Archibald parting with Lucia, as we entered; a general expression of cordiality in all eyes, even in hers; and I was welcomed, with a tinge of shame, and a little pride; but that was soon over, and I turned to depart. `Farewell!' said Archibald, `heaven bless you all! Lucia, farewell!' `You will see me again, before you leave us,' said she. `If I might,' he replied, taking her hand reverentially, and gazing on her dark, wet lashes, as if he would have given the world, only to touch them with his own; `if I might come and go, Lucia, when and where I pleased, I would spend every leisure hour with you.' `Will you walk with us to-morrow evening?' `With all my heart,' he replied; `to-morrow evening? at what hour?' `Dine with us, and we will all go!' said Mrs. Arnauld; `let us go en-bon-point.' `Embonpoint,' said Mr. Arnauld, peevishly, while Lucia coloured and smiled. `Yes' said Archibald; `we will dine with you, to-morrow.' `Good night.' `Good night! good night! heaven bless you, Lucia!' said he, passing out, and resting his fine eyes on her. She burst into tears, and turned away her face. I saw that all admired him; and that her heart was too full for a word. Was it shame and penitence, for having so lightly estimated his proud spirit?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER VII. `Caro!—a me caro! questa è una `parola che mi fa venire unsudore di `morte —. Non so che dire.' Our dinner was abundant and stylish; every thing to provoke the appetite, and enough to allay it; yet, for such things would happen in olden time, where they that loved truly were assembled—scarcely a plate was soiled. We could not eat; and, it was with some difficulty, when Mr. Arnauld, with that air of high fashion so eminently his own, filled his glass, and commanded us to follow his example, that we were able, either to manage the decanter or the wine. Our very faces shook. `Come, come,' said he, turning to his yet beautiful wife, `none o' that; but let us partake fully of the joy that is about us. We have been foolish, very foolish— ready! Let our prayer be, (rising from his seat,) that, out of this folly and transgression, wisdom and caution may grow; and, out of our sinfulness, sorrow and penitence.' `Amen!' responded all hearts, devoutly and fervently. `Let us be gone,' said Lucia, taking Archibald's arm, and moving to the door; `we shall return about candle light, mother.' Her mother smiled, shook hands with Archibald, and lifted her gentle eyes upward, as a mother would over her own child. I know not what his emotions were; but mine were delicious. I—I felt as if all the time, that had passed in displeasure, were forgotten; and that, now, in a single moment, our hearts had been brought into that warm, intimate, thrilling, and soft contact, once so dear to both. I forgot all the bitterness and darkness of my lot; and, if I could, I would have turned and fallen upon her neck, and wept—the mother of Clara! my mother! Clara's arm was upon mine. I felt her hand tremble; but was inexpressibly delighted at the change of manner which I now perceived, in the deportment of the two sisters toward each other. It was cordial, affectionate and very tender. Once before, there was something of high reproof—something ungentle, in the manner of Clara; and, in that of Lucia, the air of a princess, conscious of her supremacy; for, in beauty and power, she was abundantly superiour to Clara. This had pained me—distressed me, even in my sleep. It looked unamiable in both. In Clara, it had an air, that I could not endure to think of, that of pity, nearly allied to—contempt? No, but such a feeling as that, with which we regard a child; while the dark, melancholy eyes of Lucia—the swan like movement of her neck; her beautiful person, not so tall as Clara's, but modelled with a most voluptuous symmetry, were all radiant, with the expression of defiance and conscious superiority. This was over; and it made me so happy to see that they loved each other more, as I would wish, that I could not forbear, when Clara demanded the cause of my silence—laying my hand upon hers, with all my heart, and looking at Lucia. She understood me, and a faint hectick passed over her pale forehead. `I was wrong,' said she. `I judged the dear girl too hastily. I never saw a woman like her. She has her faults; but they are dazzling ones. For a time, I treated her as a capricious child. I was unspeakably deceived. Lucia Arnauld never was a child. Her faults have always been those of a woman. You do not know her. Your brother does not. Yet, I do believe, that he knows her better than any other mortal, not excepting myself. She astonishes me, whenever we measure thoughts together for a moment. The stature VOL. II. 10 of her is always above mine, by a whole head. I know not why it is; but, I do not feel, of late, as if I were the elder sister. You smile —' `I do, for my feelings toward Archibald are of the same nature. But pray —' said I. `No, I foresee your question,' she said, quietly, interrupting me. `Never urge me on that point. She loves him, I verily believe. Nay, it is probable that she would not scruple to tell him so; for, she is, as I have already told you, unlike any other woman that I ever saw or heard of; but, let him not hope. I can say no more. Ah! they are speaking of some matter that disturbs her. I knew by her stopping. Let us walk slower.' I held back, and observed that there was a troubled stateliness in her tread; and that Archibald occasionally made a full stop, for a moment, and almost faced her in his earnestness. We continued our walk for some time, talking upon indifferent subjects, and watching their movement, with uncommon anxiety. At last, she made some proposition, in a low voice, to which, he did not immediately reply: she repeated it. He shook his head: but after a few minutes, he stood fronting her, with both his hands clasped, and, as we were approaching them, I heard him say, very distinctly. `The thought never occurred to me; but I am of your opinion. I will forward it, with all my heart and soul: Brother —!' I was stepping forward, but Lucia said—`No, not yet. I will lead you to a place, where we can all sit down together, and deliberate upon the matter, like a congress.' So we continued our walk. `You have been very ill, Clara—have you not?' Her voice trembled, as she replied. `Yes, rather ill—rather—but—I am well again.' I understood her, and when I endeavoured to look under her broad bonnet, I could only see enough to convince me that she had felt my question. `And you—you walk a little lame! and —' `Yes!' I replied, `I had nearly lost my leg, (I felt her arm shiver in mine)—I shall probably never recover its use, entirely. It pains me a good deal, now and then—particularly on horseback.' `Then, why go on horseback?' `As an officer, I must.' `True—but, have you not done enough for your country.' `Clara!—' `Forgive me. I am wrong and selfish I fear; but your brother said something of your intention, or his, to return to your farm, and protect your mother.' `O, dear Clara!' said I, carried away by feeling, `that reminds me of my duty to her. I did not know till yesterday, how much I owed to your gentleness and assiduity for my poor mother.' I could not go on— my tears choked me. `I— God bless you for it. Yes, I do believe, that, after this campaign, I shall return, at least for a time, to comfort the declining years of my mother; and, if—Clara—if—' The poor girl could hardly stand—for what reason I know not. Perhaps there was something in the tone of my voice—something, the purport of which, I knew not; for my heart failed me; and, after the silence of a minute, I asked her some indifferent question. But no—it was no moment to trifle. We were upon the banks of the Schuylkill. The blue water ran smoothly below, just tinged with the red sunset. It was the quietest, blessedest hour of all my life. A high railing ran, rough and irregular, along the bank, just even with our breast. I turned, and leaned over it, retaining her arm all the while, and dwelling patiently, upon the water. The air was damp. Neither of us spoke. Archibald and Lucia—Copely and Elenour were out of sight. Our hearts were full, very full; and, before we knew it, the water below sparkled with rain drops; yet the sky was cloudless. We wept, without knowing it— wept in the mere capriciousness of rapture. My cheek lay upon her hand, as I leant forward, and affected to rest upon my own arm. I felt the blood rushing through it; and, before I knew my own purpose, I had pressed my wet lips to it. She turned away her face, and I saw her bosom heave strangely, for a moment, and felt her frame shake, as in the blast of winter. `Clara,' said I, at last—regaining a little composure; `by what has already happened, we have been taught wisdom. Yet—yet—it might happen again. We are very proud.' `Very,' she said, faintly. `I am going away Clara. Another campaign is before me. When we last met—let me not distress you; we were happy as we now are; a single hour changed the current of our blood—made all dark about us; bereaved our hearts. Might it not be so again?' `It might?' `And is there no way of providing against such a calamity?' `I know of none,' she replied. `But I do,' said I, `Clara, (I wondered at my own composure, but I was desperate.) You have been satisfied of my innocence, in the case of your sister.' `Yes—in the case of my sister.' `You are emphatick Clara. Have you any other doubt? Is there any other whom you —speak Clara—now, is the time.' `No, John; allow me to call you so.' As she said this, she turned and faced me, with an expression, that I shall never forget: so full of truth, and tenderness, and sincerity. `No, John, I do not doubt you. Once I did—and it almost broke my heart; nay, perhaps, had I not been undeceived by another, less proud than yourself, it would have broken it. I—' `It was not my pride, Clara, but my honour that prevented the disclosure. Yes, indeed it was. You smile—well, let there be some pride in it. The truth, is, that I would never humble that man in your eyes, whom I hoped to see your husband. No—Clara—I loved you too sincerely, too devoutly, for that. I could have died for you—would have died for you; but I could not, and would not, even to save your own life, which was a thousand times more precious to me than mine own, have done ought that would have made you less willing to make me your Lord. As your lover, I might have put my forehead in the dust. As your husband, I would not. But how did you know it? from whom?' `From Lucia herself. She told me how you had used her, and — ah! what ails you?' `I am very faint.' `John! I tremble for you. Your passions are exceedingly violent; and, I—I am of a jealous nature. Yet—look at me—I—I am not jealous.' She was pale as death—poor girl. `But my head aches. What is this mystery? Why are you so disturbed?' `Dear Clara!' said I, firmly, as soon as I could get my breath; `I cannot deceive you; but at the risk of losing you forever; nay, nay, Clara—remember the last meeting—do listen to me! There are some things that I cannot tell you. I love you. Let that satisfy you. I will be true to you, to the last breath, the last pulse. Let that comfort you. I have never forgotten you but once, even for a moment—and then, I forbore to darken your image in my heart: no Clara! without first veiling that, I could not sin. And no mortal hand shall veil it! Mine cannot. Mine have failed at the thought. Enough of self-exculpation. You believe me. Look at me. Have you that confidence in me? ask your own heart—take your own time, to answer the question—that, happen what will, you will sooner believe me, if I lay my hand upon your arm, as I do now, and say to you in this voice: Clara! I am innocent! than, in the assembled world—than, in your own senses! If you cannot answer me in the affirmative— O Clara, let us part! whatever it cost us, we shall have escaped the bitterness of that death, which will happen, if I am doubted again. I am proud—so are you; quick and resentful under suspicion; implacable VOL. II. 10* where I am not necessary to another's happiness. So are you. Think of it. If we part again, it must be forever—forever, Clara. I am growing old; and, as a rational man, I must determine soon, never to marry at all, or, to marry immediately. I cannot live in air. These are my words. Can you, dear Clara, happen what will, believe my simple word? If I say that I am innocent, believe it, let who will swear that I am not. Believe too, that if I do wrong, I shall be the first to tell you of it, and wet your hands with the weeping of a broken heart: and, in short, never believe that I have wronged you, in thought, or word, or deed —unless I have told you so, with my own lips? Let me not hurry you. Take your own time. It is all important to your happiness.' `I ask no time,' said she, solemnly, placing both her hands in mine; `you have all my confidence. I shall never believe aught against you, unless from the evidence of your own lips, or, my own senses; nor then, until I have given you an opportunity for explanation. But —' `Do that, Clara,' said I, clasping her to my bosom; `do that! and your confidence will never be abused; but what were you about to say? You smile.' `But,' said she, smiling, `my mother, who is a woman you know, of some experience, has been giving me a little excellent advice respecting you.' `How to manage me, I suppose?' `Precisely. In the first place, she says, that you are of a jealous disposition.' `I am.' `You are!—well, I confess that your frankness is pleasant enough. But do you not feel, that jealousy may become a very uncomfortable companion—a—' `Clara. My jealousy is peculiar. I should never doubt you—never watch you—never speak of aught that could distress you—no never! and though—permit me to say what cannot happen—I had become convinced that you loved me no longer; nay, that you loved anther, (do not weep, Clara,) I should never speak unkindly to you—never! I should only kiss you, and say farewell to you.' `And perhaps—' `Yes, Clara, I understand that blush—the emotion that shakes you—abandon you, and yours—my own babes, though it broke my heart—without uttering a word.' Poor Clara coloured to the temples, at this; but, affecting to smile, though the tears ran down to her lips, all the while—she shook her finger at me. `You ought to have Ellen; she would manage you. She would bring you back, dead or alive.' `Dead, she might—but, if I were not sure of my own strength, I would hang myself up at the first lamp post—or, I—' `For heaven's sake, dear Oadley, do not talk so. I quake to hear you. Let us change the subject. What think you mother says? She would have me keep you a little jealous, always; and Ellen vows, that she has made up her mind to keep Copely, forever, in hot water.' `Beware of that, Clara. It is no light matter to trifle with the devotion of a proud heart. Men, who know their own value, are jealous of it, to a degree, surpassing all that women ever believe, in their first feeling of power. They are slaves, to you, to be sure, so long as they are persuaded that your tyranical weakness grows out of your abundant love for them; and, while they believe that, they will forgive you almost any thing. But wo to the woman that is once suspected by her husband, of practising upon his affection. No Clara; I have no fear for you; but I pray you—do not permit Ellen even to talk of such a thing, in the way of conversation. It may, after awhile; become too familiar to her thought; she may be reconciled to an experiment. Alas for her, if she ever should. The spell once broken, that encompasses a heart like Chester Copely's, it is gone for ever. It is a panoply of christal. You cannot shatter it, at all—without shivering it to dust. It may bear many a heavy blow; but, no longer than while it is whole. Weaken it, and it is shattered forever and ever. I—I—pray, why are you smiling. Tell me, dear Clara, will you not'. `Certainly—I am smiling at your fine language. D oes it seem unnatural?' `Very; I have never heard you guilty of any thing that resembled it.' `I—' (The publisher, after all, is obliged to admit the truth of the remark just made; and apologize to the reader, and to the author, for a very unpleasant omission here, of a whole page, which a friend, to whom he applied, has attempted to supply. The truth is, that, one of the half sheets, by some accident, was lost by a compositor: and the publisher has done the best, in his power, toward remedying the loss, by making up about the same quantity, to fill the chasm in the form.) `Well then,' said I, stopping again, just opposite the moon, which was overtopping a clump of trees at the left, and pouring her tranquil, pale light into Clara's eyes; `I know your firmness, steadiness, and independence of thought. I am about to leave you. Away from you now, I shall be inconceivably weak and wretched, imagining ten thousand evils. Dare you, dear, Clara---dare you give me a title, to think of you without trembling?' She was silent for a moment—awfully silent. `I know not what I should reply,' said she, at last. `This proposition is sudden and unexpected; or, rather, it should seem so; and, perhaps, it is not wise nor delicate for me to understand it so readily. But, I cannot pretend to misunderstand you. Let me deal plainly then. I have expected it. It startled me, nevertheless; but your manner, about an hour ago, prepared me for it. I have thought much of you. And it has always been my notion that important matters are not to be hastily determined. We should be always prepared for the question of death or marriage. You smile—I am sorry to see it. I was never more serious, in my life. What I mean to say, is this—that, sudden as your question is, it has not found me unprepared. There is my hand! I leave it to you. My father and mother have permitted me to choose for myself. They love and respect you; and always have, without ever understanding the motive of your silence or departure. Take it; give yourself the title, of which you speak, whenever you please. I shall not tremble—for my husband—while he does not tremble for his wife.' I could not speak for five minutes—wife! husband! pronounced by the dearest lips in the world, too— Ah! it made a fool of me, and my heart—I grew giddy with my own blood. `But,' she continued—`you are going into battle. Is it wise, think you, to be hasty? would it trouble you less, the thought of leaving a bride, or a widow than a mistress behind you?' `No—it would not trouble me less, dear Clara; but it would, with all the trouble and alarm that it sent through my heart, send with them, ten thousand pleasant and sustaining consolations. God bless you! God forever bless you!—I shall hold you to your word— and—' `Here they are, yet! upon my word,' cried Ellenour, running down the hill, and clapping her hands, with Copely walking leisurely after her, his hat off, and his hair drenched with wet. `Where is Archibald?' said I—affecting carelessness. `And Lucia?' said Clara—colouring. `Where is Archibald—and Lucia.' Well, did you ever hear the like, Chester?' cried Ellenour. `In Delaware, by this time, I dare say. I never saw people walk like them, in all my life—except—why, bless me, are you walking against time?' `They are over the hill yonder,' said Copely—`and I have come to look you up. Go with me, and we will return, by a favourite path of Miss Arnauld's.' Saying this, he took the little hand of Ellen, who shook her fingers at the touch, as if they tingled to the marrow,—`a pestilent rough hold, you have, Chester —that's the way you handle your arms? I suppose?' `Precisely'—he replied—`arms and hands alike— why not?' `Well, I'd thank you to be a little more tender of mine—they are all black and blue.' `Want of practice, Nell,' said Copely—taking her hand again, pulling her arm through his, and walking over the hill, with Ellen expostulating, all the way, as fast as her tongue could run, and scolding him for his military stride. `The devil, himself, cannot keep the step with you,' said she. `So I perceive,' said Copely, in the same tone. `Saucebox'—she replied, breaking away, and skipping over the wet grass—`I—' Her foot slipped, and she fell upon her hands and knees—awkwardly enough, I confess. I would have run to her assistance, but Clara held me back—bidding me watch Copely. He started at first; and, then, as if coming to his senses, walked leisurely up to her, where she stood, blushing and pouting, her pretty hands all soiled and stained with the turf. `Monster! your handkerchief.' `With all my heart,' said he—taking it out, and wriping her hands with it, just as if they had not been the prettiest hands in the world. `What! sulky Nell? I'll tell you what it is—you'll break your neck, some o' these days, by your romping. Remember—you are to be the wife of a man—that—' `That never jumped a rope in his life. I dare say; Pray Chester, did you ever go to a fire?' `Never,' he replied—`I have heard the bells ring, now and then.' `But could never get there till the day after?' `Never. I always started the day before—if I meant to be in season for a fire; or, to help a creature like you, whisking about in the dew and twilight, like a shadow cut adrift from its body. Come, come—let us be friends.' `No—no I won't!' said the spoilt girl, skipping over a rail, two foot and a half high, at the least inch, and sitting down by the side of Lucia, who started upon her feet, as she did so. `Pray,' said Archibald rising, with a countenance that struck me—`shall I propose it, now?' `Yes,' she replied. `My dear brother,' said Archibald, turning to me— `and you Clara; I pray you to hear me, for a moment, patiently; and you Copely; and you Ellen.' `In three days more, we shall leave you. Our troops are ordered to the south. Heaven only knows, when we may meet again—if ever.' Ellen's head dropped; and, while her redundant hair blew all about, in the faint summer wind—she stood swinging her bonnet in her right hand, and leaning—more fondly than I had ever seen her, upon the arm of Copely, who stood, as if wondering what all this preparation tended to. `We have known each other long—long enough, it appears, to be willing to commit our happiness to the keeping of one another. What more do we want. The chances of battle are terrible—precarious—and trying; those of love, yet more so—of three women—nay, of four, that I know—Lucia, let me not wound you—what I say, grows out of the occasion.' Lucia stood aloof, resting against a large overshadowing tree, and leaning upon her hand, just so that her dark wet eyes, gleaming through their lashes, could be seen, under the pale sweep of her forehead. `Of these four, Clara is the only one, whose heart has not erred for a moment—a single moment. I know four men;—of these four, I am the only one—no, I am mistaken, Arthur and I have never wavered. Mary faltered; Clara stood still, and bled to death; Ellen— Ellen covered her face, with her hands, and leaned upon Copely's shoulder. `Ellen,' continued my brother—`even the dear, passionate, enthusiastick Ellen, forgot her religion; and Lucia---' Her arms dropped lifeless at her side; and, when he offered his hand to her, she had scarcely life enough to take it; yet, she could not stand upright. `Even Lucia forgot, and forswore the chosen one of her heart;—forgive me, Lucia. Copely turned to her, and drank and drugged himself, in his madness, at another's eyes. Jonathan Oadley too, for a moment, ceased to be my brother, ceased to be a man. I know it all, John—all! do not alarm yourself; and Clara knew it; and Copely knew it; long before you told it. Look at that timid girl,' (pointing at Ellen)---`she had the courage to tell it---all her shame---all your forgetfulness.' Copely kissed her forehead; and I saw her shoulders heave, in the moonlight, as if she were subbing. `Now hear me; Copely take her hand; John take her's. My recommendation to you is, that you marry before you part again.' I had expected this; and, when he finished, I turned my eyes to Clara, who blushed, vivid as fire, when she met them, and smiled at the coincidence. But Ellen— she could neither look up, nor speak; and Copely himself, appeared thunderstruck for a moment—yet, he was the first to reply. `With all my heart, Nell!' `Don't call me, Nell,' said the blushing girl, looking him up in the face. `Well then, Ellen, love—what say you? But, why need I speak? You have not forbidden it. The thought is new to me, I confess. But, why not make certain of this creature, while I can. Somebody may snap her up, before I have turned the corner, else—' `Are you ready, Oadley?' I looked to Archibald, wondering what he would say: he was holding Lucia's hand. `He speaks to you, brother,' said Archibald, `what say you?' `Why,' said I, `it would be folly to mince matters any longer. The women know that we are soldiers, and that, as soldiers wives, they must expect short notice for pitching tents, or striking them;—we say, yes.' `Well then, yes, it is!' said Copely; `and now that we have resolved—the sooner the better. I hate a long grace. But Archibald, halloo!—where now?— stealing off?' Archibald halted, as if on parole; faced about, with an air of ill disguised suffering—and Copely continued, taking Lucia's hand, who left it passively at his disposal—and placing it in his. He trembled; and her full eyes quivered in their sockets. Archibald bowed his face upon her hand; held it a moment; and, when he raised it, I saw that his nostrils were swimming in blood. `Would you!' said Lucia, faintly—very faintly; the words just reached my hearing, like the last murmur of sweet lips dying; `would you, dear Archibald?' He wiped away the blood from his lips; the flesh of his forehead shivered in the moonlight; and he stood, with his sublime eyes upturned to the sky, as if a deadly commotion were going on within his heart; his face altered, visibly, till it was like the face of a dead man. Again he bowed his face upon her hand, but was unable to speak. `Enough!' cried Lucia, in a voice of unutterable tenderness; `enough!—O God, I thank thee!' She caught away her hands, and sunk upon her knees on the wet turf—covering her face with her shawl, and weeping aloud. Archibald attempted to raise her— but it was too late. The flower of the grass had fallen. She was lifeless. Her heart had broken it seemed, in the rush of her blood. VOL. II. 11 We were inconceivably terrified; and he, poor fellow—he raved over her, like a distracted creature, as she lay, with her head in Clara's lap. But, at last, heaven be blessed! she opened her beautiful eyes, with such an expression of thankfulness, that we wept together at meeting them. `Let us go,' said she, `let us go—it is very late— I am happy now, Clara—perfectly happy. The load is lifted—I am very faint—I—Archibald, let me lean upon your arm.' He approached, ghastly as a drowned creature, and, I heard her repeat in the ear of Clara—`now I shall die contented—I—I am so happy.' `Well then,' said Copely, wiping off the first tears that he had ever shed in his life, I am sure—`I suppose that we are to take all that for a consent.' `Certainly,' said Ellen, laughing through her tears. `Would you have a girl spell her answer? That is plain English—joining hand—writing it—in reality.' `Don't you tremble, minx, at the thought of standing up, with a regiment of women, to be married to a regiment of men—I—' `Dear Lucia, I am so happy,' cried Ellen, taking her hand—`so we shall all be'—her voice fell—the hand dropped, as she saw Lucia's face. It was not the face of a bride. `Never,' said Lucia— Archibald reeled away at the sound; but, instantly recovered himself, and walked apart with us. `Will you not join us'—said she, kindly, extending her hand at the same time—`I—' `Stop Lucia,' he said, in an altered voice—so unlike his own, five minutes before, that my blood thrilled, as if a stranger had suddenly spoken among us. `Stop! the three raps that we heard last night upon our table were not idle.' (It was a strange circumstance, to which he alluded, that hapened the night before—I had forgotten it; while he and I were sitting together, at our table—in a dead silence—there were three loud, distinct raps upon the centre of the table, as if a strong hand hads truck it, smartly, with the flat palm. Archibald, I remember, turned pale; and, when I arose to examine into the cause, mocked at me—saying that he had heard it before—aye, the very night before the death of our father. He continued. `There is a death near to us. Do not tremble, woman. It is not your turn. But I have not forgotten Clinton.' Lucia uttered a faint cry, and covered her face with her hands. `Perfidious girl!' he cried—`are you never weary of torturing hearts that would die for you! O, shame on your unprincipled, bloody nature. Eyes after eyes are quenched forever!—hearts that were—O, God!— Lucia I cannot, even now, maddening as I am, under this accumulated outrage, I cannot speak unkindly to you—forgive me—O, forgive me!' He caught her hands, and held them to his heart, while she turned away her face, and stood like one about to drop into her own grave. `I have never touched that chord before—never will again. You loved him Lucia, and—would that I were in his place.' She recovered. I was amazed at the awful beauty of her countenance; her bonnet had fallen back, and her white forehead glittered, in the pride of its loveliness and purity. `Come hither, all of you,' she said; `how little you know me. You spoke of Clinton. Look at me—pronounce it again. Do I turn pale—do I tremble? Archibald. I am sorry for his death, very sorry; more sorry that he died so suddenly; and yet, more sorry, infinitely more, that he died by your hand. But I have heard it all—all! I do not blame you very much. I forgive you. There is my hand. Would that you could see my heart! You would find a reason there, that would startle you—to explain my refusal. Is it love for Clinton—mistaken man! He lived long enough to tread out the last spark of affection in this heart. No! Archibald, no! But what it is, I cannot now tell you. Suffice it to know—and I pray you all to remember it—whatever become of me—that is a reason worthy of Archibald, worthy of me. Bear with me, patiently. The secret shall not be kept forever. A little while, and you may all know it.' Our tears fell like rain, upon the grass—the sound of her voice was that of an Eolian harp, wailing to the low death wind.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER VIII. `Blood he had seen, could see—unmoved—but then— `Twas shed in COMBAT or was shed by men. `Lo! they wrestled with angels from the going down of the sun, `even unto the rising of the same.' `Well! of all the capers that ever I heard of, in my life, this is the drollest,' said Miss Arnauld, when she heard of our resolution. `Just what I told 'em! just what I told 'em!' said Ellen, shaking her hands, as if she would shake them off, at the same time. `Its a burning shame, said I; an outrage on all regular-bred novels—what! for two couple, face to face, in a bright evening—to—paugh! it makes me feel sea sick—to ask each other, pop the question, in downright English—all in each other's hearing.' `Shocking, was'nt it?' said Nick, peeping through his fingers. `I am not at all pleased with it,' said Mrs. A—. Mr. Arnauld shook his head. `I am,' said he. `It is precipitate. But, I see no reason why, in such times, people should not be precipitate—nor, when every hour is precious, why our children should undergo a formal courtship.' `Nor I,' said Ellen, meekly—in a faint, timid voice —crossing her hands in her lap, and holding up her head, like a little lady. `Just what I told them—la, said I—' `Hush! hush! don't expose yourself,' said Copely, leaning over her chair, with his cast iron face. VOL. II. 11* `Ah!' You there—Lord!—think of the—ahem— and he is sure to appear.' `You can never be alone, then,' said Copely. `Never without him, of late,' she replied, nodding. `Come, come children, no more of this,' said Arnauld, his fine eyes lighting up as he spoke. `This is no matter for trifling, no time for raillery. I do not oppose your intention. I do not upbraid you for your suddenness. You have known each other long enough, to render it unnecessary for you to deliberate much upon what, if you have not been altogether children, you must have become prepared for. You have known each other too intimately, I might add, for common artifices of the world to have any weight with you. I have been meditating much on the matter. When do you leave us?' `On Wednesday—early.' `So soon,' said Mrs. Arnauld, putting her beautiful hands upon my shoulders, `so soon, my implacable son-in-law! I would know more of you, if I could, while your ancient kind manner is upon you.' `On Wednesday?' said Mr Arnauld, musing. `Let me see. Do you wish it private?' `Assuredly!' said Copely; and I—`assuredly!' `I commend you for your discretion,' he replied. `But there needs some preparation; not much, it is true—but some. Mr. Sampson must be here; feeble and disordered as he is. Don't weep, Ellen—we must speak plainly. Your father shall be here; and the good old Dr. Hastings, who would not sleep quietly in his grave, if one of my children should be married without his participation; we must give him another Christmas dinner this year, and leave it to him to find out the occasion. There is Mrs. Oadley too, your mother, sir, who must be here. Parents can have no representatives, in a duty so awful and tender as this. And perhaps—you have a friend near us, I am told, whom it has been (a deadly paleness shot over his face as he proceeded) my misfortune; no, my wickedness to offend. Shall we send for him? It may be the hour of reconciliation.' `Yes,' said I, impatiently, `for him and—' `Brother!' said Archibald, interrupting me—while Ellen glanced her blue eyes at him, with an expression of intense alarm. `Yes, Mr. Arnauld, Arthur Rodman shall be here; and, I do not doubt that—' (I could see by his face, that he was thinking of Mary.) I would have anticipated him, for I did not then know his whole reason; but his forehead darkened— and he turned away his face; adding, carelessly—`I will see Arthur, and—see what can be done.' `Will you take the chaise, Mr. Oadley,' continued Arnauld, addressing me, `and bring up your mother. Make what arrangements you please about her return. But my motion is, that we had better occupy one house, during your absence. I shall leave the city immediately; and go back to the farm.' My heart was too full to speak a word; and Clara, as I went by her, and gave her my hand—contributed, not a little, to augment that fullness, for she said, with a look that I shall never forget: `Our mother, dear John, must not be left alone; she shall have one child to watch over her and comfort her, whatever happen.' `God bless you, Clara! God bless you!' said I, hurrying to the window, where I heard Mr. Arnauld give orders immediately, for the chaise; and saw dispositions making to fetch Mr. Sampson. `What!' said Copely, striking me on the shoulder —`ruminating? or reconnoitering?' I could not look round; but I took his hand, as I would that of my own brother—and held it, in silence. `Would that we might have a third bridal,' said he? `O, would heaven, that we might!' said a voice near me—the voice of Mrs. Arnauld—faint with emotion. `Amen!' echoed another at the window. It was that of the father. I turned, lest Archibald should have heard it; but he was occupied with Lucia, upon a distant sofa. We were all silent for a minute or two, watching their countenances. I felt a soft hand upon mine—`might it not be? they were made for each other?' `True, true, dear Madam,' said Copely; his under lip quivering as he spoke; `and, for that reason, I have no hope. Let us not mention it. They are creatures of their own mould. Their stature is not of this earth. But yesterday, or the day before, Archibald would have died, ere he had permitted the thought of such an event to enter his heart. To day, he would die, and so would she, I am sure, rather than hear the sound of it aloud. `It is inconceivable' said Mrs. Arnauld, almost sobbing; `so passionate—so devoted—so melancholy as they are. O, if it might be; but, no, I dare not wish it. Heaven's will be done! I—' `The chaise is ready, Sir,' said the servant, popping his head in at the door, and disappearing. I bowed, awkwardly enough, I dare say, to all the good people at once, and endeavoured to give an air of pleasantry to my farewell, even of a few hours, a day or two at most; but I could not—for, when my eyes met those of Clara, I stopped: the bow was arrested— I was fain to take her dear hand, in mine, and lead her to the door; where, without any body seeing it, I had just time to put my mouth to her white forehead, and spring into the chaise. My mother—O, how altered she was. The absent, wandering, mournful darkness of her eyes had gone. There was a lowly, obedient manner of resignation now, in every movement; a quiet, unrepining, patient spirit, that it did my heart good to see. We were many hours together—many of the happiest that I ever spent in my life. Her womanly beauty was not, even yet, utterly defaced; but there was a gravity, and steadiness, or simplicity now, in all that she said and did, altogether more worthy of her age than I had ever seen. While I looked upon her dark, full eyes, coal black lashes, and eyebrows black too, as the raven —her forehead just flushing, when she spoke, under the thin grey hair, that mingled with the jetty black of her plain parted tresses; there was a chastened, subdued dignity in her face, that awed me. I never had respected her so tenderly. Misfortune had laid her hand heavily upon my dear mother: her youthful vanity— her almost innocent pride of beauty, had been smitten to the dust. The wind of desolation, had gone over her dark tresses, and they were withered and blasted. A shadow had fallen upon her majesty; the snow upon her hair—and her very eyes, were the eyes no longer of a spoiled beauty, nor a delirious woman; but of the widowed and desolate one—broken of heart and contrite in spirit. We talked much and calmly of the past. She made no complaint; but her voice was tremulous, when she spoke of her desolation, and the kindness of Clara and Lucia. They had been daughters to her—and Mr. Arnauld, heaven bless him for it! had personally superintended the erection of the buildings where we now were. She spoke of Arthur, and Mary—the `poor dead Mary.' I was amazed! thunderstruck! Could it be possible that she had never heard of her being alive? Yes, it was possible! and I found it necessary to prepare her for the intelligence, very gradually. Yet, nevertheless, when it fell upon her, her eyes were fixed, as with sudden death; and she put her hands to her ears, as if the shriek of a woman were yet ringing there, and gasped for breath. At last, however, the tears gushed out, and she fell upon my bosom and sobbed, and prayed, as if her heart were bursting with gratitude. `O, my son!' she cried, `we have abused the patience of our Maker—turned our faces away from him, when he entreated as—forgetful of all that remained upon the earth. His ways, my boy, may be ways of darkness; but, assuredly, (laying her hands upon her heart, with all her strength,) assuredly, they are ways of wisdom and peace. He is the husband of the widow, and the father of the fatherless! Do not forget him. Pray to him—pray to him, forever, my child. For he hath compassion upon the sorrowing and abused.' Her sobs were hysterical now, and she was obliged to rouse herself, and leave me for a while. I understood all her feeling—all her thought; and my heart stood still, at the sound of her voice. The reproof cut me to the heart. It was—O, I cannot deny it—it was true. We had not loved our mother as we ought. We had seen some innocent vanities in her, for she was certainly the finest looking woman of her age in the country, except Mrs. Arnauld; and, heaven pardon us for it! we had overlooked her affectionate heart, steady principle, and undeviating rectitude. At last, we were on our way—having left the house, under the care of our aged and experienced overseer, who had long been a tenant of my father's; and a companion of our family, till the irruption of the enemy, when his house had been levelled even before our own; and he, with a numerous family, had been driven out into the cold world. He was a good man, and an honest one. But why delay the story? We arrived on Tuesday about noon, and found all the parties ready, except Arthur, who was hourly expected; but, I observed that, whenever I spoke of him, the eyes of Archibald, were upon me, with a strong expression, until I could no longer support it; and asked him the reason. `Say nothing of Arthur,' said he, `wait till he appears. Keep your eye upon Mr. Arnauld.' His voice was cheerful; but, it was a cheerfulness that distressed me more than all his sorrowing. It was the look of desperate, calm effort and determination. Lucia too, while she seemed utterly absorbed in the bustle of preparation, was fearfully pale, and languid; and, ever and anon, there was a slight shadow, and a sort of heaving, that went over her face; the very flesh of which, seemed to shiver at times, when no eye but mine was upon her; and, to all the world, she appeared to have no thought, but of the business in hand. Yet, she breathed with difficulty—and every breath was a sigh; and, often and often, would her eyes fill; and she would turn away her face, or drop it, as if to bite off her thread—when I could see, that she had hardly the power left to raise it again. My mother embraced her; and we were, if it were possible, for human beings to be so, on this earth, really happy. The lamps were lighted. The two brides were ready—the good parson about to stand up; sudden and fitful interruptions—forced remarks—and a painful, solemn silence succeeding to each, had rung the preparation for every heart, when Archibald entered, and announced the approach of Arthur, with a lady. `A lady!' said several voices, at once. `A lady!' said Mr. Arnauld.; `I am sorry for that. We have carefully avoided inviting any body; and—' `Arthur will help to make a third couple,' said Archibald, smiling. `Ah! well, that may do very well. They will keep each other in countenance. I am glad of it. But what agitates you so—and you, Ellen?—tears! bless me! one would think that our two girls were about to be buried alive.' `Pray,' said Ellen, stepping up to Archibald—`is she prepared? I have some apprehensions for her.' `Yes, Arthur has provided for that,' said my brother, in a low voice. The door opened, and Arthur Rodman entered, with a veiled woman leaning upon his arm—trembling from excessive emotion, and literally clinging to him; his forehead was uncovered; and, when he entered, upon my word, I do believe, that there was a general exclamation of surprise and pleasure. Arthur had grown very handsome; and his usually calm features were al in a blaze now, with expression. Mr. Arnauld advanced, and offered him his hand, which Arthur accepted, at the same time that Mrs. Arnauld exclaimed. `Dear Mr. Rodman, look at the lady! look!' She had nearly fallen at the approach of Arnauld; but, then she suddenly recollected herself, and threw back her veil; Arnauld reeled to the wall, and stood staring at her, as if she had been an apparition, with his eyes set, and mouth open. The sweat was upon his lip, and his look was that of unutterable horrour and dismay. But the blood came back to his heart—rushing over his face, and blinding him; and he fell into a chair, where he sat, for some minutes, in the terrible silence that followed, breathing like a half drowned man. At length, he arose, and came forward; at first, with a faltering step; but, as he came nearer, and Ellen had fallen with her eyes shut, into the arms of my mother—his tread grew firmer. He took his wife's hand. `I do not ask,' said he, in a sepulchral voice; `by what miracle this has been brought about. Enough for me to believe, that it is. I am—a—greatly bewildered here, (putting his hand to his forehead.) but— look at me, Mary—(attempting to take her hand; but she shuddered at the touch, insensible as she was.) `Mary,' said Arthur, `stand up, and face him. Stand up, my beloved, and faint not. Why should the innocent and beautiful, quail before such men!—Arnauld!' `Nay, Rodman, let us not renew our hatred. What has been done, cannot be undone. I am a penitent. I leaned upon a spear. It wounded me. The wound ranklesyet. Mary Austin, can you—will you forgive me? me!—Frederick Crawford.' She burst into tears at the sound of that name, and was speechless; she could not answer. `Say that you forgive me,' said Arnauld, hurriedly, `O, say it. I am growing old, Mary—and my deathbed will be less painful, if the woman, that I have most injured, will forgive me. Say that you forgive me! or, if you cannot speak, sweet innocent, signify it, by putting your hand into mine.' `May I—can I?' said Mary, just moving her lips, and looking up into Arthur's face; `may I?' `May you! love—yes, give him your hand, and wish him well, here and hereafter.' `Well then,' said Mary, timidly putting her hand into his; `I do forgive you, Mr. Craw— Mr. Arnauld. I do, and may heaven forgive you, as truly! I do not reproach you. You were not all to blame—not all—I—I—cannot say any more. Dear Arthur—I—I —the thought is hateful to me.' `There! there!' said Arnauld, rising in all his manhood, at once, and standing before his injured wife. `There is a pattern for woman! That is the blessed creature, of whom I told you; the truest and kindest; the most affectionate, yet timid and trusting heart, that ever beat—except yours, my wife, (pressing his own wife to his bosom,) and now—peace—peace! to mine own.' `Mary Austin—Arthur Rodman—are you ready?' Mary bowed her head meekly, as the clergyman arose, and opened the book. `And you Mr. Oadley? (Archibald stepped back;) and you, my daughter? (Lucia stood more erect.) Are you also ready?' I took Clara's hand, and we advanced to the appointed place `And you colonel? and you Ellen?' `Not quite, said the incorrigible girl, `these plaguy gloves,' tearing her hand through one of them, with a petulant vivacity, that could not conceal her emotion. `You tremble,' said Copely tenderly. `Pho, pho—no such thing! there, deuce take the glove! I'll be married without mittens.' `Don't be frightened,' said Copely, soothingly, and really distressed at her vivacity, for her lips trembled incessantly, and her eyes ran over, whenever she shut them. VOL. II. 12 `Frightened! who's frightened? you must have been dining out, man. Hush? the deed is doing. The incantation—Lord, how cold I feel!' `Hush, yourself, you pestilent little baggage.' But she would not let him proceed. The clergyman had just come to the word obey; and Mary had just pronounced it, with a deep, sweet emphasis. Ellen pointed at her. `Do you believe,' said she, loud enough to be heard by all of us; `do you believe that I am going to tell that lie?—obey!—I obey?— whom!—you! no. I shan't promise any such thing.' `I'll make you,' said Copely. `How?' `Choke you.' `How?' `With kisses.' `Faugh!' `Come,' said Mr. Arnauld, `come, colonel, it is your turn, now.' Copely stepped forward, and would have taken her beautiful hand; but her distress was getting too evident to be concealed. `Lord, what a fumbler!' she cried, shaking from head to foot, and pale as death. `There's a dreadful ringing in my ears,' said Copely, softly, as the clergyman moved to his place. `There will be, if you don't hold your tongue,' said Ellen, raising her hand. `How bright your eyes are, Nell!' `I'll tell you what it is, Chester Copely,' said she, looking him up in the face, while her colour came and went, like flashes of fire over alabaster, for a moment; `you will break my heart, if you are not more serious.' His countenance fell, instantly; his eyelids quivered; and he held her hand to his lips. But not a word did they hear—not a word, I am sure; for, when the clergyman paused for the response, she looked up, as if starting from a trance, in the prettiest confusion imaginable. `Love, honour and obey,' said the parson. `Love—honour—and, (glancing maliciously at Copely)—`ahem—O—O—' `Love, honour and obey,' repeated the clergyman, seriously and emphatically. She hitched forward her pretty shoulder pettishly; and Copely began to prepare his lips for the threat, by wiping them with his cuff. `Obey! obey! obey!' cried the mad girl, rising on tip-toe, and laughing faintly, as if her very heart were breaking. The ceremony was over; and Copely was about to offer the salutation of love, when the clergyman put in his claim. `Stop, Sir,' said Copely, gravely; `that woman is my wife, now. I will have no man—and no minister, the last of all men, profaning her lips, now!' We all stood thunderstruck. `I have trifled hitherto,' said Copely, walking two paces forward, `for there was no other way to win her. But, henceforth, she is mine—mine, forever and ever—in peril and in death! Shame on the man, shame on him! who, under the sacredness of his office, is the first to teach to the young bride, a familiarity with the lips of a man—not her husband. No, Sir—I honour your office. I love my Maker: and I can worship, as profoundly as any man, at his altars—where the wind is blowing through my hair, and the stars shining down upon me. But, I have so little reverence for the infirmities of a priest; so little compassion for his weaknesses; so much of a deadly hostility to his temptation, that I would strangle you Sir—you—upon the spot, sooner than you should touch the forehead of my wife.' You are amazed—all are terrified—all! even Archibald, who knows me best; even Ellen, my own, my wedded one. You do not know me. You could not. Look at this scar: for ten years it has been bleeding inwardly —yet, I never told it. I have deeper ones, that bleed yet. Come hither, Ellen—nearer, love. This wedding of ours, shall leave an impression upon your young heart, that no time shall efface. Hear me. I loved you once. You scorned me—mocked at me; and then, after I had won my way, by opennesss and manhood, into your heart, you forgot me, and shut the gate upon me, the moment that my back was turned. I loved you mightily. I swore to be revenged. Yet, hear me through. You know not the man whom you have made a lord over you. Archibald stand back! Arthur Rodman, I will have no interference! Mr. Arnauld, your eyes cannot intimidate me. Hear me through. To win that girl—young man!—if you do not wish to see blood spilt upon the spot, stand back! and, when I have done, strike. Your sister shall judge me. For nine years, I have battled against her dominion. For three, I have done violence to my whole nature—counterfeiting all passions—feigning festivity, when my heart was breaking—shutting myself up, from all mankind, when my very spirit yearned for communion— why?' `To BE REVENGED!' I pursued another. I gave into a deception, that I hated. From the first to the last, I loved you Ellen, with all my heart and soul; and, till I saw your magnanimous nature, in the affair between Lucia Arnauld and myself, I never relented, nor wavered—my whole aim was to bring you to my feet, and then—break your heart, and leave you.' We shuddered. The creature was awful. `But'—his voice changed—trembled. The tears gushed into his eyes—and he folded her hands to his heart, while she stood leaning against Mr. Arnauld, like one struck suddenly mad. `But, that was impossible. My stern heart wept. I began to love you devoutly, and with a kinder spirit. With that spirit, I love you now, Ellen. Henceforth, I have done with all trifling. It is unworthy of me; with vengeance, for your heart, love, is not a fit companion for one, where that devil is closetted. Look up dear! look up, and bless me! Here is your last trial. I have counterfeited a character, that is not my own. But, I have not counterfeited a better one than my own. Your happiness is secure—my love unalterable. And this, (kissing her forehead,) this be the pledge, that, henceforth, happen what will, you will never hear or see aught of this temper again.' The poor girl shook her head, and attempted to stand up; but her strength had gone. It was a minute or two, before she could speak; and, when she did, it was only to say: `You frightened me sadly, Chester—I thought of Blue Beard—the wolf, in Little Red Riding Hood, all the while that you stood there.' `Poor simpleton,' said Copely, `will nothing make you serious?' `Yes.' `What, I pray?' `Why, now, that we are married, if you will only be very agreeable and frivolous for a while.' `The mere spirit of contradiction then?' `Why—y—a—a—o—beside, to tell you the truth, it sits so awkwardly upon you, that I feel ashamed of it.' `O, Ellen!' said Copely, `you are incorrigible, I am afraid. But, let me entreat you, once for all, dear, not to dishonour your noble heart, and excellent understanding, so frequently—and—' `Upon my word,' said Ellen, colouring, `are you serious?' `Very—very serious.' `And you do believe then, in soberness, that I am neither a fool, nor—nor—a creature of no feeling?' `Yes.' `Then, why have you treated me so, continually, as if I were. Copely—my husband! You have said, that we do not know you. I believe it. But, you do not know me—no, not me. Come to me, as a man; treat me as a woman; neither flatter, nor coax, nor teaze me—and—lord! there's no knowing what a spartan I shall become! What are you laughing at? I can't open my lips, but your gravity vanishes, like a spectre, so that I am fain to talk foolishly and flippantly, VOL. II. 12* lest I shall look silly. Come, this appears to be a general reckoning day. I have a secret to tell you. Treat me like a woman of sense, and I will try to deserve it.' `Ellen! upon my soul, that remark of your's—that little, short remark, carries more comfort to my heart— more security than all that I have ever heard you say in your life. O, hang it, you cannot be serious.' `But,' said the clergyman, `there is another couple.' `True,' said Copely, `I beg ten thousand pardons. I had quite forgotten. Ellen, let us step aside, and give others a chance.' I glanced at her face; it was a bright crimson. `Not another step!' said she, `there! they are ready.' `What! you do not surely mean to look on, and watch how they undergo the ceremony?' said Copely, moving off. `Indeed I do,' said she. `Perverse and—' `Barbarian!' she replied, gently, yielding to him, as he drew her to the window seat. This was the last that I saw. My heart was giddy. I felt a painful rush of blood through the channelling of my temples; and, though I was told afterward, that I went through the ceremony with exceeding steadiness, yet I knew nothing of it, till I felt my lips throbbing against Clara's. She was full of dignity and seriousness; exceedingly pale, but firm, and collected; devout, and prepared. The clergyman paid me a remarkable compliment, I remember, when he was through. `You have thought more of this ceremony, and of its great obligation,' said he, `than all the people that I ever married. May heaven bless you!' `Ah! a horseman!' cried Mr. Arnauld, `what is the meaning of this?' We all crowded to the window, and saw Archibald dismount. We had not missed him—and Lucia, where was she?' The next moment, he entered—his hair all in disorder—his forehead covered with sweat—his deep blue eyes strangely disordered in their lustre. He bowed hastily, and said something, in the way of apology for leaving us—something, that none of us could understand, or recollect, after he had gone; glanced rapidly round the room, as if in search of somebody— `Lucia,' said he, `where is she?' `Here I am,' said Lucia, stepping forward, from the corner, where, hidden by the heavy curtains, she had set for one hour, concealed from our observation. Her step was singularly firm: her carriage haughty. `Will you favour me with the conversation which you promised?' said Archibald, advancing toward her, and offering her his hand. `Assuredly,' she replied; `but are you ready? is all prepared?—all!' `All,' said Archibald. `Follow me, for a moment, then,' said she. `Mother, I shall not be gone long.' Her hand was upon the door, as she said this; and her mother, struck by the preternatural steadiness of her manner, advanced a step or two, as if to address her. `No, my dear mother,' said the haughty girl, her sweet lips parting with a mournful smile, no, it is impossible—we must be alone.' A bright colour flashed over the eyes of Mr. Arnauld; and he exchanged a glance of disquieted, earnest pleasure with his wife, as the door shut upon them. They had been gone about ten minutes, though it appeared much longer, for we were breathless in our expectation; trying, in vain, to start some subject for talking; but not one of us had our thought or senses sufficiently at our command, to understand any thing whatever. At last, all at once, we heard a sharp cry, as if a dagger had been driven, through and through, a human heart: a cry that froze our blood—it thrilled through every apartment of the house. We sprang from our seats—the women screamed, and we burst open the door, through which Archibald and Lucia had passed. The great doors, that opened into the hall, from the portico, were wide open; the lamps blazing; and, at the foot of the steps, there stood a horse, saddled and bridled, with the gate open behind him. While I was wondering at the signs of preparation below, something—to me, it appeared like a spectre, starting out of the solid wall—came, staggering out of the darkness, athwart the hall. It was Archibald. The room behind him, the walls beyond, were all black as midnight. The light of the lamps could not penetrate so far. It was all the work of a moment. As he approached me, aiming blindly toward the portico, I pronounced his name, with a sensation of unutterable alarm; but he heard me not. His hair stood upright. There was blood upon his lips—and sweat upon his forehead, as he went by me, with his eyes wide open, without seeing me. I know not what followed, for a minute or two—I was like one suddenly deprived of all motion and life. The whole family rushed into the room opposite; a loud and general shriek followed—and, the next moment, while I was groping my way to their aid, hardly conscious of what I was doing, I encountered Mr. Arnauld, staggering under the body of a woman; (it was Lucia;) the mother and all the family following, like distracted creatures. Archibald passed on—in the general consternation; descended the steps; leaped into the saddle; and was gone, ere any other voice, than, that of wail and lamentation was heard. I had only time to see, as Copely turned fiercely round, and ordered his horse, that blood was upon Lucia's hands, and a print upon her forehead as of bloody lips—when— When—O, righteous heaven! she opened her eyes, locked her white hands, grasped for breath, and then fainted away again. Her distracted father bore her away—followed by my mother and hers, and my wife; while I, God only knows what had been my thought—I cannot recall them, but they were very terrible, so terrible, that, when I saw Copely bare headed in the saddle—with his holsters over his arm—I could have cheered him onward, to the massacre of my only brother. The whole house was in an uproar, the servants running hither and thither, and we, utterly unable to control them. A trampling of hoofs followed—and a horse, with the reins loose, and saddle turned, came thundering into the court, the fire flashing from the pavement, like a rocket, at every blow of his irons. `Whose horse!' said I—`not Copely's—is it?' `No Sir,' said a servant—`it is not the Colonel's; I gave him the parson's, as he stood ready tackled.' `Merciful heaven,' said the good man. `I tremble for the consequences! But, let us be prepared.' `Joy! joy! joy!' rang a dozen voices, all at once, from the top of the stairs. We crowded to the place; and fell upon our knees. The blessed Lucia was herself again—unwounded, unhurt; the blood upon her face, and hands—she knew not whence it came. She was rational—and told us that we had seen Archibald, she believed, for the last time. A new horrour took possession of us. The composure of her tone was too unnatural, too calm, for aught but settled despair. Was it his blood—then— his? that we had seen? and by whom shed? `Ah! Copely! are you hurt?' `No!' he replied—shaking the dust from him, but where is Rodman? what is the meaning of this? why, is he not in the saddle? Ha! Rodman—mount! mount! and away. Take your pistols, and if you get as near him as I did—mind your reins before you fire. Bring him in, dead or alive. The murderer! I should have brought him down, but for that cursed horse.' `Man,' said I—`laying my hand upon his shoulder. I am Archibald Oadley's brother. What have you done?' `Risked committing murder; risked breaking my neck; risked covering myself with the blood of a brave man, the dearest friend on earth—that I might bring a murderer to justice—poor Lucia!'— `What have you done, Copely?' said I, collecting all my breath, and all my strength, to hurl him from the steps, if he answered me, as I expected. `Did you overtake Archibald.' `Almost, and called to him, again and again; but, he rode on, gallopping as if the avenger of blood were at his heels; and my horse became unmanageable—and I, hoarse from shouting—and—' `At last, I lost my patience—`stop! Archibald Oadley,' I cried, `stop! or, by the God of my fathers, I will bring you down with a pistol bullet! I was near enough, almost, to grapple with him once, but he saw nor heard me.' `I levelled—' `And fired?' said I—raising my arm— `And fired!' said the cold hearted man, without moving a limb, or retreating one inch from the blow. `Did he fall?' said I, delaying it. `Not immediately,' he replied—`but—ha, what is the meaning of this? Are you all mad?' `Answer me,' I replied, `before I strike you dead at my feet—' `You! Oadley! you strike me dead! I pity you. But, you are his brother. He is safe. I saw him, holding on his way—long after I fired. He many thank my horse for it, though, and the holsters over my arm; for, the moment that I fired, he reared, stumbled and threw me, head over heels, into the dirt.' `Do you know,' said I, almost choking, with the thought of Archibald's escape; and Copely's too—I may say, for, had he wrought Archibald's doom, I should have slain him, I am sure. `Do you know that Lucia is safe? uninjured—unwounded?' `Merciful heaven! Oadley—what! but—Do you dare to trifle with me? Speak! speak! is she not wounded? speak!' `No—no,' I repeated—`rash man, she is not—but God only knows if my brother be not.' Our distress was inconceivable, for a time—but Arthur returned, at last, with the intelligence that Archibald had been seen, in the company of a strange man, riding toward the wood—in the same attitude— still at full speed, but sitting upright, sustaining himself in the saddle as no mortal man could, if he were wounded. This gave us comfort; but, our wedding night was one of sorrow. All the darkness through, we were walking about, husbands and wives, like creatures that have been shipwrecked, and wait for the light of morning, to know where they are. And, when the day light came, it was bluish, frightful and cold; so that, as I was preparing to mount my horse, and go in pursuit of my poor brother, dreading now, the disorder of his intellect, rather than any bodily calamity—I felt weighed to the earth with apprehension; and I was hardly in the saddle, when one of the servants cried out, from an upper window, that over looked the high road, that a man on horseback was riding toward the house. A minute more, and he was visible to me. He was a young countryman; and, the moment that he entered the yard, he gave me a dirty paper, which appeared to be the tattered leaf of a book. Upon it, was scrawled, in the hand writing of Archibald, these words. `Be happy. Do not alarm yourself about me; tell our mother that I shall go to the army; and not return till—till—the war is over. Farewell—farewell. Heaven bless you all—Archibald. P. S. I am very well this morning. Farewell!' `How did he look?' said I, to the man. `Look! Sir? don't know, sir—kind o' smiled—and I a'most cried to see him.' Poor Archibald!—he never smiled again.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER IX. `The tender blue of her large loving eye, `Grew frozen, with its gaze on vacancy.' Just as we were rising from our dinner, on Tuesday, a letter was put into Copely's hand, saying that we should not be wanted for a week; that our furloughs were all extended for ten days; and beseeching us not to lose the occasion, by hurrying away from all that was dear to us—perhaps forever. It was not in the hand writing of Archibald; but there was an authority within, signed by Washington himself, upon which, was an endorsement—that we knew. That was by Archibald. `Love to all the family,' it said. `Be with us any time before ten days. Pulaski's legion are off; and we are ordered for the south.' Judge of our emotion—we had set, mournfully, all the day long beside each other, like people, who can count the moments of their happiness. Our hearts were full, and our eyes reeled in their lustre, as we arose, and struck hands, and embraced all around. Let us hurry over these ten days. They were the happiest of my whole life; days of deep feeling, quiet love; and confidence, so holy and pure; tenderness, so still and hushed, that, when I recur to the memory of them now, in my forlornness and abandonment, my heart feels warm again; and, if I shut my, eyes, I can feel the wet lips of Clara upon my forehead, trembling there; and, my arm encircling her—O, Clara! peace to thy shadow, love. Thou art very dear to me. At last, the morning came; not the tenth morning— but the eighth; for, happy as we were, husbands as we were, we had not forgotten the duty of a soldier; and our horses were already pawing the green turf under the open windows; and snorting, gallantly, to the wind. Imagine that you see us; three stout men and true, nay, four; two, of a very lofty stature; and two. Arnold and Copely, not tall, but moving with an air of irresistible authority; old Mr. Sampson recovering a little, and leaning on his crutches at the open door, that looked into the yard, his white hair blowing about his keen eyes and red face—like a thin vapour about a bed of coals; my dear mother and Mrs. Arnauld; and three brides, with Nick, full of heart and glee, teasing, first one, and then, the other—all huddled together, half sobbing, and half smiling, the lofty Clara, in the middle of them, like a queen among her maidens, looking out upon her husband, as he prepared to vault into the saddle, the roguish eyes of Ellen beautifully dashed with a timidity, that keeps them continually upon the earth, while her parted lips appear constantly opening for a sally, that she can find no voice to utter; Mary, the soft, gentle, patient Mary, with her quiet eyes roving continually after the form of Rodman, while the colour flashes over her transparent forehead, every time that she meets his. It was a picture full of beauty and meaning. `But where is Lucia?' said I—`I promised to see her this morning.' `She is waiting for you,' said her mother—`really I forgot it.' So, I hurried off, and found the dear girl, sitting at the window, with a large shawl wrapped round her. `You will see Archibald,' said she, `give him that lock of hair. He will prize it. You need have no fear that he will not. I know his heart. He knows mine, now. Watch over him, my brother; you are my brother now, I feel it. Take the blessing of your sister —her last, it may be, dear John.' VOL. II. 13 `A sister!'—O, I could have fallen on my knees, and wept in her lap; the name of a sister was so sweet to me; so new and pleasant. `Comfort your brother. You know not, you never can know, what a blow has fallen upon him. Tell him, however, that I shall do as I promised; love him, forever; respect him, forever—weep, forever and ever, that we may not be nearer to one another than we now are.' `But why not?' dear Lucia, `why not?' I cried, catching her hand—heaven and earth! how her face altered. `Because,' said she—`I love Archibald—love him, O, man! with what truth and sublimity—yes, the sublimity of devotion! for that reason we can never meet.' I looked at her. Her eyes were strangely bright; but, her voice, broken as it was, had meaning in it— and reason. Was she disordered? I knew not. I only knew that she was unintelligible. We parted; embraced—parted—with our tears upon each others cheeks; Clara too—dear, dear Clara! thy tears are there yet. We parted. Enough. We were soon in camp. `Brother!' said Archibald, throwing himself into my arms, with a sob that shook his whole frame, almost to dislocation—`Brother!' I understood him, but too well. I looked at him; and pressed him to my bosom. Poor Archibald. It was too late. I had seen many fearful changes in my day—many! many in his countenance, that had terrified me; but, none that resembled this that I now saw. He was wan as if he had risen from the bed of death, his temples sunken, his lips blue; and his eyes beautifully bright and thoughtful. `Your hair is very wet, brother'—said I, as he leaned against my face. `I believe so,' he answered, mildly—`of late it has been so, night and day.' `But'—(looking me wistfully in the face)—`you are happy—all are happy, all!' `Not all,' said I—putting the lock of hair into his hand. `What is this, brother?' said he, opening it with a hand that appeared to move of its own will. `Hair! whose hair. Brother! in what spirit was it given? not in mockery I hope—I trust—I believe.' `No—no, Archibald; but after she recovered.' `No matter for that, pass over that. I know all about her recovery. I thought her dead.' I repeated her message. `God forever bless her for it!' he said, the tears starting out under his compressed eye lids. `O, brother —let me lean on you. I am very laint. There is not such a woman upon this earth—so lofty—so—' `Then why abandon her, Archibald?' `Why? look at me.' I did, and was terrified: his eyes shot fire; and were blood shot, with the convulsion that my words had called up. `I—I'—(his voice grew fainter—gentler—he put his hands upon his heart.) `Brother—I love her; she is a noble creature. Let that testimony comfort her. She has done most nobly. I venerate her; love her— the hand of death is upon me.' I would have rebuked him, for what he said; but I could not. I had not the heart to contradict him. It was too true. The hand of death was upon him. `Ah, Copely!'—(He entered abruptly.) `Archibald,' said the untractable man, as he put out his hands to him—`do not curse me—do not—I cannot bear it.' `Say no more, my excellent friend,' said Archibald. `I understand you. You are a good shot—see here,' (raising the flap of his coat, and showing where the ball had gone through.) `You would certainly have brought me from the saddle, had you been upon your own horse. Not another word about it. I know it all —and forgive you; nay, do not even blame you—except for missing your mark.' `Your voice is very much altered,' said Copely— `and you are wasted, wonderfully, since we parted, I— but no, I will not ask. There is my hand—if I can do any thing for you, say so. If not—there is only one way—hear it. Where is Pulaski?' `Gone south—' `And we are to follow, are we not?' `We, of the horse, are detailed; and, perhaps—you can exchange, as you are so fond of fighting.' `I beg your pardon Oadley. I am not fond of fighting; no man likes it, less; but, just now, I begin have some qualms.' `Vapours,' said Archibald, with a sickly smile— `you are newly married.' `And,' said Copely—`I do not much care to expose that little witch to widowhood—nor to a troop of bayonets'— `What mean you? your wife does not go withyou?' `No, not in person—but in spirit, I believe—poor little puppet! She has become quite rational of late, and I should be sorry to part with her.' `Hourra! for the major!' cried Jasper, galloping up to us—`hourra for the legion.! we are off, at daylight.' `I am glad of it,' said Archibald, fervently; and we immediately separated, each to arrange his arms, shake hands with a few brave fellows, and receiving their congratulations. `We must put you in the front rank,' said La Fayette —`you three bridegrooms would carry all before you. It was a rash affair, I think; but, you will fight the better for it—if that be possible.' We were soon upon the march, in a cloud of dust; and never rested or halted, a single hour beyond what our cattle required, until we encountered Pulaski himself; and were paraded in front of General Lincoln's tent, before Savannah, in Georgia. The Count D'Estaings had just arrived, with a formidable fleet; and the British, on the station, had fled, like birds before the fowler; leaving three of their ships in his power. His army, about three thousand strong, were just arranging themselves at Beaulieu; and, on the fifteenth of September, we were brought up, at full gallop by the unconquerable Pole. Lincoln was behind; and endeavoring, with all his power, to effect a junction preparatory to an attack upon General Prevost, the enemy's Commander in Savannah. Till the twenty-third, we were in a state of continual preparation; Pulaski dashing, hither and thither, night and day, with his men; and exercising them, forever, in the broadsword; and Archibald, with the same death struck countenance, mingling impatiently in all the storm of preparation, as if to drown the suffering within him. Still, the moment of the town's reduction appeared distant, very distant—yet, without an hour's intermission, for several days and nights, there was one uninterrupted roll of thunder, from the cannon of the enemy and ourselves—nearly two hundred pieces in all. And often, while Archibald and I were treading the rounds, in the deep midnight, we would be covered all at once, with sand; or, made to reel with the wind of an exploding bumb or passing cannot ball; till, at last, it was really wonderful how unaffectedly careless we became. The whole sky was in a blaze, at times; and, many an hour, have I seen the smoke from the enemy's south western battery, rushing all white, upon the wind, like that of ten thousand furnaces, with a perpetual gushing of brilliant flame through it; and heard the tremendous noise of the cannon below; and the heavy, dull, earthquake sound, of a bomb, high in the blue air, lumbering through the sky—and passing, star after star, like a rebellious planet—struck from its orbit. `We are to storm the works,' cried Archibald, rushing into my arms, one morning. `And Pulaski swears that he will ride into them, on horseback, if we will follow him.' `Follow him!' said I, `that will I—but when?' VOL. II. 13* `Tomorrow—immediately,' he replied. The French admiral is afraid of his ships—the hurricane season is at hand—the British swarming from their station in the West-Indies. In short, we are to carry the works to-morrow—sword in hand. Ha!—you turn pale, brother—this comes of getting married!' `It does,' said I—`it does. But I shall do my duty. Poor Clara!'—— `Forgive me, brother,' said he, grasping my hand. `I would fain find some consolation for my own barrenness. How young I am! a mere boy; yet, how long, how painfully long and weary hath been my life! O, brother, brother! I have outlived all hope—all— even the wish to live. The stern, dull, heavy wretchedness of life, that weighs and bears upon us, like a cearment of lead—I—I—no, brother, I cannot talk about it. All that I know, all that I can know, is—that, while I do live, I will try to do rightly, but I care not how soon—no, no!—I may be wanted no more on earth. This very night brother—sinful as I am---I could lie down to sleep quietly, and happy, if I knew that I should never wake again. Shame on these tears. I am ashamed of them; yet, I cannot help them. I must weep—for my heart is young, brother, very young, and it is awful for a young heart like mine—to be so loaded down—to the very earth. I—yea—weep with me; unmanly as it is, I cannot help it. I meant to live, and I hoped to die, without one murmur of complaint. But I cannot. It is not in human nature, to shut our eyes upon all the beautiful things of this world —with that deadly indifference to them all, which I feel, without a mortal terrour and sickness, that will have way, in tears. I do not wish to live; I do not fear to die. Young as I am, I am weary of life. The sun is hateful to me. The happiness of others, of them that I must love, hath ceased to make my heart warm; and why should I live? I tremble at these symptoms; the more, because the time has been, when it was my comfort, and my religion, to believe that, if I could see others happy, others, that I loved, I could not but be happy myself. I was mistaken. I have a colder heart; a worse one; a more selfish disposition than I ever believed; the happiness and suffering of others have no longer any influence upon me. I am angry and peevish with their sorrow; and wrath with their childish happiness. I cannot dwell upon it.—Alas, brother —I rejoice that the battle is near. I hope that it will be my last---my very last—yet—God's will be done!' Never shall I forget the tone, in which those words were pronounced; never, the look of patient, unrepining fortitude, with which they were accompanied. It was the eighth of October, about eleven at night—and such a night! so hushed and brilliant with the innumerable swarming of fire flies: an awful stillness all about the camp, partly of preparation, (for we had resolved to storm the works by daylight,) and partly of terrour; for we had already been broken in upon by two or three spirited sorties. There was a something in the air too, as we lay along upon the fresh grass; and felt it moving through our hair, that made us feel mournfully. Archibald's pale forehead was upturned to the starlight, and his wet eyes shining, as I never saw them shine before; my bosom torn upon, for the heat had been intolerable, and I would fain have slept, till the trumpet called us to the assault. A strange drowsiness was upon me—within me—as if soft lips were whispering about my naked heart. `Brother,' said Archibald, after a long silence, putting his hand upon mine, and leaning his elbow on the turf. `I am ashamed of myself. Even now, alone as we are, with none to see me, I cannot bear the upbraiding of my own heart. I have been wonderfully weak. Thank you for that pressure. It reassures me. I look about me again, with new feeling. There! that cannon, the first that we have heard for an hour; even that has a pleasant sound to me.' The ball passed directly over our heads. `We had better move further down the bank,' said he, changing his position; `another ball, from the same elevation, make strike lower.' I followed him, with a mournful, strange, yet pleasant feeling about me; one that I would not have given up, for much that the world calls happiness. His thought was in the right train. The sublimity of the hour—the growing darkness: for the heavy fog began to roll in, like the ocean, before a sea breeze—and the wind rose— `It is very awful,' said he, in a low, thoughtful voice, `to sit up at an hour like this, and contemplate the great heaven, all of such solid blue, passing away over our heads, so tranquilly! so beautifully! and to have our hearts jarred, in their worship, by the roll of cannon, or the sudden bursting of a bomb.' A second ball struck the works a little at our right, dismounted a piece of large ordnance, shattered the carriage into fifty pieces, and tore several human creatures, limb from limb. A loud shrieking followed, for full a minute. Gracious God! how fearful it is! `brother,' said Archibald, `when the blood is cool—the air so still, and the stars so patiently looking down upon us, to hear the blood rattling at our feet; and know that the very sound which has passed over our heads, harmlessly, has carried an immortal creature, maimed and broken into the presence of his God.' `Let us remove further off,' said I, `we can be of no use. I see by the lights there, that they are bearing three or four bodies off.' Another shot passed over us; and, instantly the lights were extinguished—a crash followed—a loud, terrifick outcry rang, through and through, our heads; and we saw the whole cavalcade tumbled together— the living, the dead, and the wounded. `The same gun,' said Archibald, `a little more, or a little less powder, has done all this terrible work. They that came, with unthankful hearts, to bear away their dead comrades, have fallen with them! Awful— the bearers and the body—the living and the dead, have fallen before us! Hush! they are in motion.' He was right. Our army had already put itself forward; and we could hear the tread of their feet, like the noise of a great ocean breaking, wave after wave, afar off, upon an interminable solid beach. In the mean time, it had grown very dark; and, through the deep fog that blew in our faces and assembled about us, the shadows of men appeared of unearthly stature. `Here they are!' cried a voice that we knew; and, the next moment, down leaped a pair of giants, as they appeared, and ran to us. `Archibald—dear Archibald!' cried Arthur, `now for it! to horse! to horse! Pulaski's calling for you.' `Away! away!' cried Copely, embracing him; `away! my brave fellow, and if we never meet again, why God, forever, bless the survivors.' `Amen!' we responded, `amen! amen!' `And the dead too,' said Archibald. `God be merciful to them too.' `Amen! amen! amen!' echoed several voices; where, we had not time to enquire, for, Archibald's horse stood stamping the platform at a little distance. `Brother!' said he, taking leave of me, last, `farewell! I shall do my duty—do you, yours.' I saw no more of him; but Arthur was conspicuous to the last. We moved on, in the darkness, through a sunken, deep hollow, which permitted us to approach very near to the enemy's lines, without being perceived. It was near day light, and uncommonly cold for the season; probably owing to the heavy fog, and the exhalation from an extensive morass, on the very verge of which, we were marching. We had depended much on surprising the enemy, and had good reason to believe that the quarter, upon which we moved, was the weakest; but, in both calculations, we were mistaken, for a deserter had betrayed our design; and a tremendous cannonade opened upon us, the very moment that the head of our column showed itself. The sky shook over our heads; and the horses stumbled at every step, as if the earth itself were unsteadied by the roar. But the column kept on, under Sullivan and D'Estaing, turning neither to the right nor left, and broke through their entrenchments, in a cloud of smoke and fire; at the point of the bayonet— charging their artillerymen at their pieces, and bayonetting them, in all directions, without firing a shot. `Hourra!' cried the Americans, `hourra! the day is our own!' Up went two or three flags, in a blaze of light; dripping with blood, and tore with the thunder of battle. But the day was not our own! The enemy rallied on the left, and came down upon our brave fellows, like a hurricane. The flags shook—and hundreds of human creatures that battled under them, French and Americans, and English, leaped, headlong, into the ditch. `Now for it! my boys! now for it!' shouted Pulaski. `Hourra for Pulaski! hourra! hourra!' answered his legion, and followed him, one after the other, into the entrenchments during the pause of terrour that followed the cry, like a battalion of devils. Pulaski was the first man. How he got in, heaven only knows; but I tried three times, before I could follow him; and, for five minutes, it appears to me, that he and not more than a dozen men of his troop were sustaining the whole battle within the line. At length, in came the whole troop, man and horse—Pulaski's sword flashing before them, like a pillar of fire. He was too conspicuous; his great white horse was a target, and the bullets fell upon him like a storm of hail. I saw him, when he fell. He was standing up in the stirrups, and I saw a tall fellow reeling before him; when, all at once, his great white stallion snorted, as if his heart had broke, leaped, all clear, of a hundred bayonets, at once! and Pulaski fell back in the saddle, still holding on by his knees, while the saddle-cloth trailed in blood, and his charger broke forward, trampling down every thing that opposed him, till he came to an empty enclosure, where we were endeavouring to rally about him. There his horse staggered; sat upon his haunches, (like the animal that you may have seen in the picture of St. Paul's Conversion, when God pours down a beam of glory upon him,) quaking —planted, and ready to drop dead—the blood gushing out of his nostrils—and—I saw no more. We were all in a heap together, I was bayonetted, I know not in how many places—and all that I do know, is, that I cried out, to a man for quarter, in the desperation of my heart, as my sword broke at the hilt, and my horse stumbled into a platoon of bayonets; but the wretch heeded not my cry. I was unwilling to die so. I thought of Clara; it was my last thought—and, the next moment, I felt the blood rushing out of his throat into my bosom. `When I came to my senses, there was a cold mass of coagulated deformity, shapeless and horrible, pressing against my face. I shuddered, and tried to release myself; but, I could not. My hands were stiffened about it. God of heaven! it was a human face!— O—my heart discharged all its blood, at the thought! I shut my eyes, and groaned aloud, in loathing and terrour—but I could not release my fingers from the throat, they were so cramped and rigid with convulsion. No! though a broken sword was in my side, and my clothes were stiff with my own gore. I could not. They were rigid as iron. At last, however, just when I was shutting my eyes, I did hope, for the last time, some blessed human creature, tore away my hands from the detestable shape, and dragged me away, over the shattered limbs, dead bodies, and struggling horses, as if to throw me into a ditch. I groaned; for I could do no more: and he stopped—deliberately took up a gun, with a bayonet, near me, and put it to my heart. I felt the point— I felt it! the inhuman devil! He was cooly searching for my heart! I came, instantly, to my senses. I grasped the bayonet with my hands; and held it, despite of all his struggles, till in our tumbling and turning, it came off. I was desperate. The noise of strife had gone by—the fog was clearing off. The sun shone about me; and I saw, far and near, the enemy riding about, and collecting the dead and wounded. I expected to die, and was willing to die; but, my heart rose terribly at the thought of being murdered in cold blood. The wretch left me, for a moment, evidently for the purpose of finding some safer weapon; and I, determined not to be sacrificed, collected all my strength, griped the bayonet, and lay waiting for him. He came—and, standing about three feet from me, made a deliberate cut at my face, with a sabre. I was able to parry it—and, could I have reached him, would have let out his heart's blood, before human help could have aided him—but, he was too far from me; and, exasperated to madness, by his cold blooded, merciless depravity, I hurled the bayonet at him. Thank God, it struck him in the face, and he fell! Yet, when he fell, and I saw the point where it had passed through his neck, and heard his horrible yelling, I was fain to stop my ears, and cover my eyes, or I should have gone distracted. After this, I can remember little more than, that I was in the hospital of the enemy, and treated with great care and attention—made a friend of an able surgeon, who was thunderstruck at the situation of my wounded leg:—inflamed now, to an excessive degree— and, in short, that I was obliged to lose my leg. In the mean time, however, I had the happiness to hear that Archibald had escaped miraculously, after exposing himself with unprecedented hardihood. For a moment I had seen him—it was after we had entered the entrenchments, engaged, on foot, with an officer of the enemy. I felt no fear for him, then, for I saw that they fought with swords. Arthur had received two or three sabre gashes; and Copely had one of his fingers shot away. But the whole army, particularly the French, were loud in his praise. Every man of his command, had been driven into the ditch—and, with the exception of ten, or a dozen, all were killed or wounded. A speedy arrangement was made for our exchange —and, the moment that my friend, the humane and benevolent Waters, the British surgeon, under whose care it was my good fortune to fall, would permit it, I was put on the way for my home. It was a long time, and I was cruelly wasted and disfigured, when Archibald and I met. Yet, he was unaltered—the same deadly paleness; the same settled, calm, awful insensibility. `Return,' said he, `be a comfort to our mother— bless your wife—and bear my love and reverence—do you mark me? my reverence, to Lucia. Tell her not to forget me. We shall meet again, here, or hereafter. Copely, and Arthur, and I must remain. Copely, to atone for his early misconduct: Arthur, in expiation of his vow—for he promised never to marry, till America was free, and broke it—shame on him! and I— merely because I cannot live, in a quiet, peaceable element.' Our parting was sorrowful; and—so we all thought I am sure, a final one. My situation was exceedingly critical; and I was helpless, beyond all that you can imagine, from having seen some evidence of my strength, after it had begun to decline. Time was, my children, when no mortal man could have stood before me. I am no boaster. Arthur Rodman was a tall stout fellow, and passed for a strong man; yet I could pull Arthur Rodman to the earth with one hand. Yet, after the loss of my leg, and the wasting of the fever that followed it, I was scarcely able to lift a spoon to my mouth; and, but for Clara—heaven bless the dear woman! but for her I had never lived through it, I am sure. My children, you can never know her value. From the time that you can recollect her, she was feeble and dim. You should have seen her, about the bed of her husband; sick and dying. You should have VOL. II. 15 hope.—I look back upon my past life, with a strange, melancholy wonder---much that I have done, appears to have been done by some other Archibald Oadley; and not by me. So young; so tender hearted, as I was---a boy, but the other day, and now dying, with grey hairs in my head, (it is a fact, brother)---of old age---premature old age, and a shattered frame; substance and being, body and spirit shaken to the dust. For one thing only, do I reproach myself— nay, for two—two, above all others---the blood of Clinton, is one---my stubbornness to Lucia, is another. But for them, I could sleep quietly; and, mayhap, die very quietly---but they haunt me, with a continually encreasing darkness and threatening.—I cannot sleep now, at all. I walk all the day long, to and fro, in the camp, when we are encamped; and ride, all the day long, when not encamped---but, without knowing or caring, where I am, or what I have done. I walk in my sleep, too---that distresses me. I know not what may happen---the sentinels are trusty, and I am ashamed to communicate the truth. You would not believe me, I suppose, should I tell you, what is very true--- that, after the battle, yesterday, I fell asleep upon my horse, while my men were returning from the pursuit; and might very easily have been taken prisoner. At times, there is a lethargy, pleasanter than sleep---a drowsiness, like that of sorrow and love---as if I were sleeping upon the bosom of some dear one, that besets me---and my heart overflows and—but no, —shame on these emotions. I have written to Lucia. Bid her bear up---bid her be comforted. We shall soon meet again---again! where our hearts may beat renewedly, forever and ever; purified and blessed.' `Purified!' echoed the sweet martyr, faintly dropping her arm, over the bed; and falling upon her face —`purified!—I—' a long and continued shuddering followed, in which the bed, itself, vibrated, and the whole room trembled. `But the other,' said Clara, wiping her eyes and reaching me Copely's letter. It was very brief, and to the following effect; but, just as I opened it, in came the two brides; one, flushed with a beautiful confusion, the other laughing and crying, all in a breath; and rallying Mary, with a significance that I dared not understand; till the sweet girl burst into tears—partly of shame, partly of sorrow; and Ellen threw herself upon her neck, crying, `hush! hush, love—forgive me. I was cruel—childish—indelicate and—hush—all in good time. We shall be a houseful, nevertheless, (in a low voice) by the time that he comes.' She did not mean that I should hear this; but it touched Clara, who coloured, and withdrew her hand from the pillow, against which I was leaning, to give a reproof to Ellen, that nobody should understand but the women folks. Copely's note. `Rodman would have written you; but, he has just finished a letter to his wife; and he cannot manage the pen for another line. The broad sword has cramped his hand. He deputises me to give his love to you all; and to say to you, Oadley—and to our's and your's—heaven have mercy on all of them, and particularly, on mine and reform her—if it be not too late.' `He be hanged!' cried Ellen, pettishly. `Prepare yourself—be a man. Your brother encountered and slew two officers, with his own hand, yesterday —and took, with Jasper, of whom more by and by, and five more of the troop, twelve of the enemy prisoners; and then went to sleep in the saddle. Be a man, I say, again. Your brother cannot live long. His hours are numbered. `Gracious God!' cried Ellen, `if Chester Copely be trifling now, I shall hate him forever.' `O, I hope that he is!' said Mary, in a voice like a lone instrument, breathing to the wind. `His hours are numbered. A consultation has been held, since my last, for we are unwilling to lose him— but, there is no hope. Am I abrupt? I fear so. But —you are a man—your brother is a man. He has no wife—no children—no beloved one—no, I am wrong, he has an angel to leave behind him.' `Not long,' said Clara, kissing her sister's forehead —`no, no, not long, I am sure.' `Would that you could see him! (said the letter.) He never looked so well in his life. His temples are transparent. Every movement of his heart is visible in his eyes.' We all turned to Lucia, at these words; it was a description of her appearance. `Poor fellow! he has just left me, treading firmly the road that leads to the chambers of death. Why delay it? why conceal it? It fell upon me, like a thunderclap. It might fall upon you so. We have done our best to prepare you; at least, I have, for, while there was any hope, he kept his situation a secret. But my course has been different. I have told you the worst. You must not blame me, however, that my last letter was not alarming. When that was written, I began to have hope—I have none, now.' `The last! O! we are illy prepared yet,' said Clara. `Would that it had arrived before this. Such blows are terrible—I—' `Jasper is dead—dead, poor fellow. I saw him fall; but Archibald has just given me a particular account of the transaction, with an air of pleasantry, that made me scold him. `I saw him,' said he, when the bullet struck his heart; he was at full speed. Yet he kept on, for a whole minute, and went completely through two divisions of the broadsword, as I am a living man, before he fell: the saddle turned, and the horse broke away from under him—the saddle-cloth shot to ribbons, and dripping with blood. I found the poor fellow, cut all to pieces; his helmet shaved away; his uniform shot to tatters—and the blood gushing out at his shoulders. He died desperately. `But I expected it,' said Archibald, `for, in his jocular way, I heard him, the morning before the attack, while newly arranging a part of the troop, in consequence of sickness and continual battle, I heard him order all the ladies in the front rank.' `The ladies!' said Ellen—`what the deuse does the fellow mean?' `The mares,' I replied. `Jasper always called them the ladies of the troop—most of them were blooded.' `But why put them in the front rank?' `For many reasons.' I said, smiling at the question, so innocently asked, and wishing, from my soul, that I had not read the passage aloud; for Copely was full of such jokes, `the fire and quickness of females, are proverbial; the competition that would be produced; the gallantry that it would provoke—the—' `Read on,' said Ellen, impatiently—dropping her eyes; `read on; what does the creature say next?' `Nothing—except that I am to stand—here, read it yourself—godfather to—' `I won't!' she cried, jumping up, in a pet, and running out of the room. `Why, what possesses the poor woman?' said Mary, her sweet, innocent lips parting so quietly. Clara smiled; and handed her the letter—which sent her out of the room, just as fast. `Pray, what is the meaning of all this nonsense?' said Lucia, with that calm, beautiful propriety, which grew upon her every hour, till her death. `I cannot pretend to misunderstand it. The feelings of the man —the father! are natura: and why? Sister Clara, I am ashamed of you; yes dear, of you. Young as I am, I have that within me, that cannot play tricks, even where they are looked for. I do not like Copely's levity. The thought should solemnize him; the peril of his wife—so delicate and frail, as her tenement is, that should make him speak seriously. But perhaps he would give it, the least insupportable air that he could; and affect a pleasantry, while his heart is breaking, to amuse others. Nay, sister—am I not right? What is there to redden at? What to be ashamed of? I know not what a mother's feelings are, it is true. I know not what it is, to feel the stirring of life within me; a life that is to make me altogether my husband's, here and hereafter: but I do know this, that I should neither VOL. II. 15* toil at concealment, nor deplay, in such a situation, where it was not a reproach. Still less would I affect such tremours; or, if they were not affected, would I indulge them before my husband, or before any body that had eyes.' `Lucia!' said Clara, blushing all over; `you astonish me. I shall be offended, if this conversation continue.' `Shame on you, then—shame on you! the woman, in your situation, whose nerves will not permit such a conversation; whose temper will not permit it, had better die barren. I am serious. This is no sudden thought. I know what I say. I have meditated upon it. I love delicacy, I trust that, whatever be my faults, I have not that of indelicacy at my door; but I detest prudery and affectation. You are already a mother, Clara—and must think and act like one. Your own health, and that of your babe demand it.' `By heavens, Lucia, you are a noble creature,' said I, kissing her; `I am glad of this conversation. It will be the better for poor Clara. Hitherto, the theme has been a forbidden one between us two; yes,—between the father and mother! at a moment so critical too, when she is most in want of all sympathy and encouragement. No Clara; give me your hand—there, thank you! I love you unspeakably, as you know. I love modesty. I revere this delicate timidity; this bashful sensibility; but, it has gone too far—to an extent, dear, unworthy of one so thoughtful and firm as you. Your sweet sister has said wisely. These agitations and tremours may have a worse tendency than we dream of. Let us learn to think of the event without stammering; to be prepared for it. One kiss! there— there! Now go to Lucia, and let me see you kiss her.' Clara did, while the tears danced in her full eyelids, and thanked her. Our arms entwined altogether, in one dear, thrilling embrace; and the tears of the two sisters fell upon my face, like a warm, summer shower, in a pleasant wind —just at the shutting in of day light. Woman!—the companion of our bed side—from our cradle to our grave!—our ministering angel!—our nurse!—our consolation, in all sorrow and trial —from the first beating of life within us—to the last, the very last, upon the bed of death—thou art the sweet fountain, and nourishment of all our holiest being—and of all our most immortal nature and quality!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XI. “And coming events cast their shadows before “———He awakened a sound, “Like the stirring that comes from the tenanted ground “When revelry wanders there. In my last, I spoke of the letter, which Lucia had received from Archibald. On looking over my papers, I have found it. More than once, have I seen it blistered with tears —it is hardly legible at this moment; and, were not the sentiments so deeply written on my heart, I should not be able to decypher it, I am sure, in its present tattered and defaced condition, as it lies before me, while I transcribe it—with emotions, my children, that shake every fibre of my constitution — that—but read for yourselves—remember the situation of the parties, youthful; lovely; strong; and bowed down with a mysterious sorrow. If you feel aught of what I have felt, five hundred times, in reading it, your young hearts will collapse with a terrifick suddenness, again and again, as the apparition of the two broken hearted lovers, with pale lips and beautiful eyes, and loose hair, rises before your thought—read it!—read it!— and say if you wonder at the unsteadiness of my hand, in transcribing its wild, incoherent, disordered language. (Archibald to Lucia.) `Between thee and me, Lucia Arnauld, let there be peace. The way of our life, thou strange and wonderful woman, has been a way of deep feeling, passion and darkness. Let it be so no more. Lucia! we have lost much. We might have been happy; blessed, and blessing. We might have been, but for the untimely blight of our warm hearted affection, happy and dear to each other—o, how dear! forever and ever. Lucia! there are times, when I could throw myself down upon the green earth—underneath which, I shall soon lie tranquilly, I hope, and weep myself to death. It is when I see the apparition of her that I have loved, as I last saw her; before a bad man had stepped, in a wayward moment, into the sacred place of my devotion—and carelessly defaced the blessedest image of light and beauty, that man ever kneeled to—her dark hair wet and glittering with the dew—her awful eyes, shadowed with the tender and absolute blackness of the deepest passion. She loved then—she loved me, Archibald Oadley. Then why stood I upright in her presence? Why—when all the world knelt to her— to thee, Lucia?—did I uncover my brow, only; and look upon thee, undazzled, unterrified!—why, when they, that listened to thee—while thy heart warbled at thy lips, like a young bird, buried in apple blossoms— the sound gushing out, as if she were delirious and faint, with the perfume and beauty about her—why, when they looked lovingly upon thee, and were prodigal of sweet things, why did I, I alone, Lucia, stand apart from thee—with my hand over my eyes—silent as death?—Why, when thy feet glittered in the dance; and to all that looked upon thee, half blinded by thy beauty, it seemed that the musick, which they heard, came from movement of thy limbs—why stood I apart, and mute, while they were loud and lavish of their rapture?—O, Lucia—ask thy own heart. I was a proud and imperious boy. I loved thee. I loved thee too much—for the life of my own heart; too much, to breath thy name lightly; too much, when I heard thy voice, or thy tread, while my heart hid itself with terrour and joy—not to move away from the world, where I could shut my eyes; (not on thy beauty—that could not be)—where I could stop my ears—(not to thy voice—for that were impossible—blind and deaf, I should have heard thee and seen thee, forever and ever, after that night). Then why did I? ask thy own heart Lucia. Did I not love thee? Didst thou not know it? Hath not my voice failed me; and the tears filled my eyes, all of a sudden, when thou hast entered where I have been; nay, at the sound of thy tread—has not thy own mother seen my nostrils gush out with blood. Did I not love thee?—Then why, though I were mute, and blinded, and sought the solitary place, where I used to go in worship to thy creator—thine Lucia—for, till I thought of him as thy creator, I never loved him— to meditate upon thy melancholy beauty, and swift way wardness, and power and brightness, why was I not forgiven?—Had I loved thee less, O, woman! could I not have poured out incense to thee, with as wasteful a hand as another? Did I want the power? the ability?—no.—Thou hast seen me, when ministering to women who were not dear to me, among the readiest, to do what I despise myself now, for having done; waste the truth and simplicity of my nature, in the mere wantonness of a boyish imagination; hiding my disapprobation of their folly, shrouding every unlovely feature of their person or mind; and aggravating, by every artifice in my power, every beautiful one. If I could do this so readily; and, that I did do it readily, I appeal to thy own memory, Lucia, to say, could I not, let thy heart answer, in its wisdom and simplicity, could I not have ministered to thee as readily? unless withheld by some better and higher feeling. I could talk to others; compliment others; maintain the play of conversation, with many a sprightly lip at the same moment; dance with others; sing with others —to whom I was indifferent, and who were truly indifferent to me. Then why could I not, with thee? was I careless of thy love? knew I not how priceless a thing it was?—O, Lucia—how bitterly we have been deceived. Our haughtiness hath been our death. But for the breathless sweet tenderness that I felt for thee, I could have spoken freely, many a time, when, to all that stood about me, I appeared sullen and discontented. I was not so—I was too happy to talk, too proud to tell, even to thee—that my faculties stood fettered before thee; but my mind bowed down, and my tall spirit dwindled in thy rebuke. Lucia—Lucia! —when I appeared to others, nay, to thyself, dear, to love thee least—I was dying with my love of thee. I was indeed. * * * * * * When Clinton—may I speak of him? When Clinton came to your father's Lucia (my hand is getting steadier.)—I thought that he had never seen you before. Why did you not tell me of it?—why?—There was the death blow to our confidence. I saw you colour; I saw you address him as a stranger—and yet, I saw you, secretly, receive him as one that you had known before. I saw him, but I was too proud to ask the reason; too proud even to mention it, in any way, to any body upon this earth, that I had seen you meet, as I had. To his last hour, he knew it not—John knows it not, to this; your mother, father, Clara— nobody, no living creature, Lucia, ever knew of it, or ever shall, till you see fit to tell them. `Now hear me. For many hours, I watched every movement of your lips and eyes, till I was very sick with expectation. I hoped that you would come to me, Lucia, and tell me that you loved him. I hoped this; for that were better than to see you disingenuous. But you did not; no, you did not. You doubted my strength. O, Lucia, how little you knew it! I would have laid down my life to promote your happiness, in any way. If I could not be your husband—for a mere lover, I could not be; I hated the fondness and caprice and childishness of that relationship; but a husband! O, young as I was, Lucia, I felt my veins thrill with a pure, and religious, and sublime emotion, when I thought of my duty to you, as my wife. I wept and prayed too, love, while I thought of it; but, as I was saying, if I could not be your husband, I would content myself with being your friend; the best and truest friend upon the earth. Why did you not tell me that you had seen Clinton before? that he loved you, and that you loved him? How much of soreness, sorrow and bitterness might have been spared to us!— Well, well—It is now too late to weep over the desolation that followed that concealment. I was prepared dear, for any thing, for every pore, but caprice, in Lucia Arnauld. I could have borne to lose her; to be lost! but not to have her fall in my respect; or, to fall myself, in her's. I watched the growing intimacy; not with a jealous feeling, not in anger—O no! but with a heart that bled at every face, with terrour and consternation. I tried to tear your image away from my—its place, but could not. I determined to tear away heart and all with it, if there were no other way. I have succeeded. My heart is dead—dead! but, within it, there is yet a moving of vitality, like a spark buried in ashes. The flowers are withered and trampled on, but the earth is impregnate with their odour. And even at this moment Lucia, while I put my cold hand upon it, I feel thy image there, like a little babe, stirring under the pressure. O heaven, have mercy upon me! `Well, Well—at last, the spell was broken. I shuddered and wept at thy infatuation; but, nobody knew it. I wasted away, with the thought of blood; walked in my sleep; and rode furiously through the battle, in search of quiet—everlasting quiet, Lucia— but nobody knew it. At last—you were to have been happy. God knows how I prayed for you—how heartily I would have bled to death for you; but, no, you would not trust me. I was shut out, utterly, from your dear heart—utterly!—well, I bore that. I made no complaint. I was weary of life, faint; very faint at the heart; but, I told nobody of it—till — Lucia—Lucia! the letters turn to blood while a write— the table shakes—the summons will be repeated---there there! there!— VOL. II. 16 or woman, man:—farewell, Lucia—farewell! I shall never meet thee, again—never. I feel that I shall not. If I should be able—I—but farewell, do not expect another letter. May we not?—hast thou the courage, love? thou art very feeble—and I can feel that we are wasting, together—might it not be that we could depart together? —Let us pray for it. * * * * * * Yes—I would have married thee, nevertheless! ARCHIBALD. Such was the letter that Lucia gave to me, on the very day that it was received! I wondered at her. There was a meaning in it, that I dreaded to fathom---nor had I an opportunity, for nearly three weeks; during which time, James was born. Yes, James, you were the first fruit of our union---our pride and beauty:--- and Ellen had a little girl; a very feeble, sickly thing, who, heaven bless the sweet creature, I saw afterward dying in your brother's arms. As soon after these events had happened, and the tumult, of a father's and a husband's heart, had been permitted to subside, as it could be, I opened the subject anew to Lucia. She was holding my boy in her arms; her red lips looking, as if they had been moistened with the kisses of her own babe. `Lucia,' said I; `have you answered Archibald's letter?' I had no idea that she had. I asked the question only by way of introducing the subject, for I have observed that women are less scrupulous about entrusting their sacredest and fearfullest thought and confession, to men, than to women; even if these women be their mothers, sisters, or daughters; and that, when they do this, they choose neither father, brother nor child, nor husband nor lover. And they are safer in it. Men feel a pride in such confidence; a pride too, in protecting and advising, their helplessness. There cannot be any collision of interest or passion—nor envy, nor uncharitableness VOL. II. 15 hope.—I look back upon my past life, with a strange, melancholy wonder---much that I have done, appears to have been done by some other Archibald Oadley; and not by me. So young; so tender hearted, as I was---a boy, but the other day, and now dying, with grey hairs in my head, (it is a fact, brother)---of old age---premature old age, and a shattered frame; substance and being, body and spirit shaken to the dust. For one thing only, do I reproach myself— nay, for two—two, above all others---the blood of Clinton, is one---my stubbornness to Lucia, is another. But for them, I could sleep quietly; and, mayhap, die very quietly---but they haunt me, with a continually encreasing darkness and threatening.—I cannot sleep now, at all. I walk all the day long, to and fro, in the camp, when we are encamped; and ride, all the day long, when not encamped---but, without knowing or caring, where I am, or what I have done. I walk in my sleep, too---that distresses me. I know not what may happen---the sentinels are trusty, and I am ashamed to communicate the truth. You would not believe me, I suppose, should I tell you, what is very true--- that, after the battle, yesterday, I fell asleep upon my horse, while my men were returning from the pursuit; and might very easily have been taken prisoner. At times, there is a lethargy, pleasanter than sleep---a drowsiness, like that of sorrow and love---as if I were sleeping upon the bosom of some dear one, that besets me---and my heart overflows and—but no, —shame on these emotions. I have written to Lucia. Bid her bear up---bid her be comforted. We shall soon meet again---again! where our hearts may beat renewedly, forever and ever; purified and blessed.' `Purified!' echoed the sweet martyr, faintly dropping her arm, over the bed; and falling upon her face —`purified!—I—' a long and continued shuddering followed, in which the bed, itself, vibrated, and the whole room trembled. `But the other,' said Clara, wiping her eyes and reaching me Copely's letter. It was very brief, and to the following effect; but, just as I opened it, in came the two brides; one, flushed with a beautiful confusion, the other laughing and crying, all in a breath; and rallying Mary, with a significance that I dared not understand; till the sweet girl burst into tears—partly of shame, partly of sorrow; and Ellen threw herself upon her neck, crying, `hush! hush, love—forgive me. I was cruel—childish—indelicate and—hush—all in good time. We shall be a houseful, nevertheless, (in a low voice) by the time that he comes.' She did not mean that I should hear this; but it touched Clara, who coloured, and withdrew her hand from the pillow, against which I was leaning, to give a reproof to Ellen, that nobody should understand but the women folks. Copely's note. `Rodman would have written you; but, he has just finished a letter to his wife; and he cannot manage the pen for another line. The broad sword has cramped his hand. He deputises me to give his love to you all; and to say to you, Oadley—and to our's and your's—heaven have mercy on all of them, and particularly, on mine and reform her—if it be not too late.' `He be hanged!' cried Ellen, pettishly. `Prepare yourself—be a man. Your brother encountered and slew two officers, with his own hand, yesterday —and took, with Jasper, of whom more by and by, and five more of the troop, twelve of the enemy prisoners; and then went to sleep in the saddle. Be a man, I say, again. Your brother cannot live long. His hours are numbered. `Gracious God!' cried Ellen, `if Chester Copely be trifling now, I shall hate him forever.' `O, I hope that he is!' said Mary, in a voice like a lone instrument, breathing to the wind. `His hours are numbered. A consultation has been held, since my last, for we are unwilling to lose him— but, there is no hope. Am I abrupt? I fear so. But —you are a man—your brother is a man. He has no wife—no children—no beloved one—no, I am wrong, he has an angel to leave behind him.' `Not long,' said Clara, kissing her sister's forehead —`no, no, not long, I am sure.' `Would that you could see him! (said the letter.) He never looked so well in his life. His temples are transparent. Every movement of his heart is visible in his eyes.' We all turned to Lucia, at these words; it was a description of her appearance. `Poor fellow! he has just left me, treading firmly the road that leads to the chambers of death. Why delay it? why conceal it? It fell upon me, like a thunderclap. It might fall upon you so. We have done our best to prepare you; at least, I have, for, while there was any hope, he kept his situation a secret. But my course has been different. I have told you the worst. You must not blame me, however, that my last letter was not alarming. When that was written, I began to have hope—I have none, now.' `The last! O! we are illy prepared yet,' said Clara. `Would that it had arrived before this. Such blows are terrible—I—' `Jasper is dead—dead, poor fellow. I saw him fall; but Archibald has just given me a particular account of the transaction, with an air of pleasantry, that made me scold him. `I saw him,' said he, when the bullet struck his heart; he was at full speed. Yet he kept on, for a whole minute, and went completely through two divisions of the broadsword, as I am a living man, before he fell: the saddle turned, and the horse broke away from under him—the saddle-cloth shot to ribbons, and dripping with blood. I found the poor fellow, cut all to pieces; his helmet shaved away; his uniform shot to tatters—and the blood gushing out at his shoulders. He died desperately. `But I expected it,' said Archibald, `for, in his jocular way, I heard him, the morning before the attack, while newly arranging a part of the troop, in consequence of sickness and continual battle, I heard him order all the ladies in the front rank.' `The ladies!' said Ellen—`what the deuse does the fellow mean?' `The mares,' I replied. `Jasper always called them the ladies of the troop—most of them were blooded.' `But why put them in the front rank?' `For many reasons.' I said, smiling at the question, so innocently asked, and wishing, from my soul, that I had not read the passage aloud; for Copely was full of such jokes, `the fire and quickness of females, are proverbial; the competition that would be produced; the gallantry that it would provoke—the—' `Read on,' said Ellen, impatiently—dropping her eyes; `read on; what does the creature say next?' `Nothing—except that I am to stand—here, read it yourself—godfather to—' `I won't!' she cried, jumping up, in a pet, and running out of the room. `Why, what possesses the poor woman?' said Mary, her sweet, innocent lips parting so quietly. Clara smiled; and handed her the letter—which sent her out of the room, just as fast. `Pray, what is the meaning of all this nonsense?' said Lucia, with that calm, beautiful propriety, which grew upon her every hour, till her death. `I cannot pretend to misunderstand it. The feelings of the man —the father! are natura: and why? Sister Clara, I am ashamed of you; yes dear, of you. Young as I am, I have that within me, that cannot play tricks, even where they are looked for. I do not like Copely's levity. The thought should solemnize him; the peril of his wife—so delicate and frail, as her tenement is, that should make him speak seriously. But perhaps he would give it, the least insupportable air that he could; and affect a pleasantry, while his heart is breaking, to amuse others. Nay, sister—am I not right? What is there to redden at? What to be ashamed of? I know not what a mother's feelings are, it is true. I know not what it is, to feel the stirring of life within me; a life that is to make me altogether my husband's, here and hereafter: but I do know this, that I should neither VOL. II. 15* toil at concealment, nor deplay, in such a situation, where it was not a reproach. Still less would I affect such tremours; or, if they were not affected, would I indulge them before my husband, or before any body that had eyes.' `Lucia!' said Clara, blushing all over; `you astonish me. I shall be offended, if this conversation continue.' `Shame on you, then—shame on you! the woman, in your situation, whose nerves will not permit such a conversation; whose temper will not permit it, had better die barren. I am serious. This is no sudden thought. I know what I say. I have meditated upon it. I love delicacy, I trust that, whatever be my faults, I have not that of indelicacy at my door; but I detest prudery and affectation. You are already a mother, Clara—and must think and act like one. Your own health, and that of your babe demand it.' `By heavens, Lucia, you are a noble creature,' said I, kissing her; `I am glad of this conversation. It will be the better for poor Clara. Hitherto, the theme has been a forbidden one between us two; yes,—between the father and mother! at a moment so critical too, when she is most in want of all sympathy and encouragement. No Clara; give me your hand—there, thank you! I love you unspeakably, as you know. I love modesty. I revere this delicate timidity; this bashful sensibility; but, it has gone too far—to an extent, dear, unworthy of one so thoughtful and firm as you. Your sweet sister has said wisely. These agitations and tremours may have a worse tendency than we dream of. Let us learn to think of the event without stammering; to be prepared for it. One kiss! there— there! Now go to Lucia, and let me see you kiss her.' Clara did, while the tears danced in her full eyelids, and thanked her. Our arms entwined altogether, in one dear, thrilling embrace; and the tears of the two sisters fell upon my face, like a warm, summer shower, in a pleasant wind —just at the shutting in of day light. Woman!—the companion of our bed side—from our cradle to our grave!—our ministering angel!—our nurse!—our consolation, in all sorrow and trial —from the first beating of life within us—to the last, the very last, upon the bed of death—thou art the sweet fountain, and nourishment of all our holiest being—and of all our most immortal nature and quality!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XI. “And coming events cast their shadows before “———He awakened a sound, “Like the stirring that comes from the tenanted ground “When revelry wanders there. In my last, I spoke of the letter, which Lucia had received from Archibald. On looking over my papers, I have found it. More than once, have I seen it blistered with tears —it is hardly legible at this moment; and, were not the sentiments so deeply written on my heart, I should not be able to decypher it, I am sure, in its present tattered and defaced condition, as it lies before me, while I transcribe it—with emotions, my children, that shake every fibre of my constitution — that—but read for yourselves—remember the situation of the parties, youthful; lovely; strong; and bowed down with a mysterious sorrow. If you feel aught of what I have felt, five hundred times, in reading it, your young hearts will collapse with a terrifick suddenness, again and again, as the apparition of the two broken hearted lovers, with pale lips and beautiful eyes, and loose hair, rises before your thought—read it!—read it!— and say if you wonder at the unsteadiness of my hand, in transcribing its wild, incoherent, disordered language. (Archibald to Lucia.) `Between thee and me, Lucia Arnauld, let there be peace. The way of our life, thou strange and wonderful woman, has been a way of deep feeling, passion and darkness. Let it be so no more. Lucia! we have lost much. We might have been happy; blessed, and blessing. We might have been, but for the untimely blight of our warm hearted affection, happy and dear to each other—o, how dear! forever and ever. Lucia! there are times, when I could throw myself down upon the green earth—underneath which, I shall soon lie tranquilly, I hope, and weep myself to death. It is when I see the apparition of her that I have loved, as I last saw her; before a bad man had stepped, in a wayward moment, into the sacred place of my devotion—and carelessly defaced the blessedest image of light and beauty, that man ever kneeled to—her dark hair wet and glittering with the dew—her awful eyes, shadowed with the tender and absolute blackness of the deepest passion.

My hours are numbered. This is the third time. Is it a delusion? Ask my brother? He sat by me one night at the same hour, and heard them—when I not only heard them, but saw the hand that gave them —saw it! as plain as I now see this paper— Enough. I would not have slain him; no, by heaven, I would not, but for that last word that he uttered. That was the death word. I drove my sword up to the hilt, into his heart. He deserved it; true, or not true, it matters not. He knew how I loved thee; worshipped thee; and, though it had been true to the uttermost extent, he deserved death—death! aye, death here and hereafter—death and damnation, for blaspheming thy purity —O, Lucia—I did not believe him for a moment —no, not for a moment—and my soul shuddered at the altar, when I remembered that I had sent Clinton before God, with a lie in his mouth. `But—but—Lucia—it is getting very dark. I feel, as I felt, when we parted last, and the foam stood on my lips, as I stood over thee, and saw thy locked hands and speechless mouth ready to crumble into dust before me. Sublime and incomprehensible woman. It was too late, too late! Death had already breathed upon my heart; and it was passing away in vapour and shadow. But for that—though I had gone mad upon the spot—mad and dark—forever and ever—while the benediction was pronounced—yea! though I had known, that the moment I had touched thy forehead with the seal of a husband—thou wouldst have been a widow—and I, a corpse—yet, I would have married thee, nevertheless!—Let that comfort thee.— Proud as I am; stout hearted, and unforgiving, as I am; romantick and fastidious as I am; I would have been thy bridegroom, Lucia, notwithstanding all that had passed, had the tale of death and shame, been told me, but a little earlier! Now, it is too late; we shall die asunder—loving, O! as never man loved woman VOL. II. 16 or woman, man:—farewell, Lucia—farewell! I shall never meet thee, again—never. I feel that I shall not.

I asked the question only by way of introducing the subject, for I have observed that women are less scrupulous about entrusting their sacredest and fearfullest thought and confession, to men, than to women; even if these women be their mothers, sisters, or daughters; and that, when they do this, they choose neither father, brother nor child, nor husband nor lover. And they are safer in it. Men feel a pride in such confidence; a pride too, in protecting and advising, their helplessness. There cannot be any collision of interest or passion—nor envy, nor uncharitableness between them. My remark, therefore, was intended to lead her into just such a disclosure, as would give most ease to her own heart. I asked no questions. I meant to ask none. But to what I said, she replied: `I have already written to him.' `You have!' said I, astonished at her self-possession, `and has it gone?' `Yes; nearly three weeks since.' I waited for a moment, fashioning to myself some mode of inquiry, to prolong the conversation; while it should neither distress her, nor myself; for I began to love Lucia, the dear patient sufferer, with a quiet, deep reverence, that never diminished, to the last moment of her life. `Take your babe, a moment,' said she, `and I will show you the answer. You would like to see it; and I kept the copy for you—and you alone. I would not have Clara see it—John—' She stopped, and put her white hand upon my child's head. `I shall not live long; not many months, I am sure; as you wish for a blessing on that child, let the secret die with you.' `Sister—nay—do not go, yet.' `O, it makes my heart warm,' she replied, locking her hands, and pressing them fervently upon it, `to hear that word from the lips of a man. Brother! sister! O, there is comfort, strength, and honour in the countenance of a brother!' `Dear Lucia; I cannot give the pledge that you desire. I cannot become the guardian of a secret, that Clara may not participate in.' `Do I hear aright, brother?' `Yes. You do not know her; either commit it to both, or—' `Weak man,' said Lucia; `I pity you. what! can there be no secret from a wife—none!—none of sorrow or shame?' `None!' I echoed, firmly—`none, certainly, of sorrow or shame.' `I will not stop to argue with you, John; there are things, which must be left to trouble the heart of the man alone; things, that should never be told, but with a design to make the woman happier or wiser. Why should she sorrow in anticipation of what may be uncertain? Why, be made to weep at evils, which, to her gentleness and inexperience, may be disheartening? while, to the man of fortitude and steadiness, they are but temporary embarrassments? No, my brother—no! none but a weak husband will say: I will have no secret from my wife. None but a weak husband will trouble his wife with all that troubles him.' `Lucia, hear me. Of all my pleasure, my wife hath a full share; of all her sorrow, I would share all that I may. But how may this be, if either believe that the other has some untold malady of the spirit, or of the heart; feeding, like a serpent, upon the vitals, day and night; for which there is to be no remedy, not even that of tears; no, sympathy, because it is untold. No! I will hereafter have no secret, that I may not, under any circumstances impart to my wife. All that I say is this: Leave it to my discretion. Bind me by no promise. Let me do as I may believe it best, whatever may happen.' `You are right, brother,' said Lucia, in reply, `altogether right. That is the spirit of a man. I will trust to it. I will bring you the letter. It will tell, not a fearful tale; for I am still (covering her face with her hands, under pretence of excluding the sun,) too much of a woman to tell it all: it will tell enough, to show you that, while I live, it is no tale for the ear of my sister.' `There!' said she, returning soon after, with a face unusually pale; `there! take it, while I have collectedness and courage enough, to give it to you, with my own hands: and read it. Nay, not yet; give me your boy, your little Archibald,' (for so, we had first agreed to call him, till Archibald requested him to be called James, for what reason, I know not,) `and read it while I am away.' She came to me, then; and, putting both her hands into mine, said, with a low, sweet, tremulous voice, whose accents I hear yet, whenever I have been more than usually devout and abstracted in my religious duty; as if to reward me. `Remember my situation—tempted—tried—scorned—proud—young—helpless, and have compassion on me.' The tears gushed out of her eyes, all at once, as she uttered these words; and she had nearly fainted; but, at last, with James nestling at her bosom, she succeeded in raising herself, and tottering out of the room—the little brat squalling all the while, as if he were bound up with pins and needles. —yet his cry was musical—to me, I mean. He did not cry like any other child, that ever I heard. I opened the letter. It was hardly legible; written, evidently, in the hurry of her feeling, without attention to what the world are pleased to call pretty letter-writing. It follows. `You are deeply to blame, Archibald. You have stirred up a spirit within me, that will never sleep again. The darkness is scattered. I see clearly now, more clearly than ever, the dim and perilous road, over which I have trodden. You are very incoherent. I shall, probably, be more so. You speak of my appearance, when you saw me last. When do you mean? Where was it? I do not understand you. Yet, making all possible allowance for the aggravating power, which we all have, and you, in an especial manner, of picturing whatever is past and gone—irretrieveably gone, as supremely beautiful and dear—I find something, that has given me a clue to your meaning, where you speak of the last time that you saw me. Yes, I understand you—Archibald: I cannot deceive you. On that very night, I first saw Clinton. It was he, that I had been walking with. My heart was heavy, sorrowful at your coldness—pining under mortification, and sore with the jeering of my companions. He took VOL. II. 16* advantage of it. He spoke kindly of you—very kindly —defended you—argued as you do, that you felt more than other men, because you professed to feel so little. Where we feel, we are hushed, terrified, silent, and under a perpetual anxiety to please; our manner is constrained, abrupt, fitful and capricious. Thus, he reasoned with me. I began to like him; not for his own sake, but for yours. When we returned, I found you there; the same haughty, cold, and absent manner; and I was piqued at it. A few minutes after, I was rallied about Clinton; and threatened with your wrath. I affected to scorn the latter; and, had you not appeared with your heart in your eyes, while we were talking, which you will probably remember, from the confusion that it caused among us, for we were afraid that you had overheard us—I know not what I might have said of you. Your manner was new to me —it carried me away. I could have fallen upon your bosom and wept, before the whole world, Archibald; as I live, I could, with simple joy, at the change. I never shall forget your looks; your hand trembled; your hair was wet, and waving over your temples; your deep blue eye, were strangely dark and mellowed; and your voice went to my heart. I do not remember your words; I did not hear them; but the sound, I have heard, again and again, since, in my sleep. I found that I had never known you. I had believed you too ambitious to love heartily; and I was impatient of being loved, with aught less than absolute and unqualified devotion. You were diminutive in your person; it mattered little to me then, that your soul was the soul of a giant. — You were neither handsome nor showy; though the aged, I had seen, stand still before you; and the wise holding their breath; yet, such was the foolish weakness of my heart, that, when I was surrounded with taller and handsomer, and more fashionable men, I was afraid to acknowledge any preference for you, even to myself. I loved you; but I was ashamed of it: not ashamed of you—no, I was very proud of you. But I could not abide to have it known among my companions, that I had made such a choice. They could not know you; and I have been mortified to tears, more than once, at their jibes, the simpletons! and their raillery, when, had you but entered the room, you would have put them and all their idols to shame, with a single word Archibald, this is the truth. Do you remember that night, when I sat upon the railing under the pear-tree, and you stood hear me; and I turned away my face, and you asked me, why I refused to answer you? Yes—you cannot have forgotten it. The truth is this: I had not the courage to tell the truth; and I could not tell a falsehood. I was very happy. The expression of your face was noble; and I was contemplating it, as you stood looking at the soft low moon, at our left. I had forgotten Clinton; all the world but you; when, some devil forced the observation upon me, that you were very short, and he very tall; nay—for there you stood before me, that you were so very short (you have grown since,) as not to overtop me much, when you were standing and I sitting. It was this, that made me turn away my face, and weep; for I did weep, Archibald. I had been, more than once, on the point of mentioning the walk, that I had taken with Clinton, in the simplicity of a young heart, honest and ingenuous; but a new, strange feeling of shame and discretion prevented me, after I had thought of your stature. I excused the concealment to myself—so unlike me, as it was; by saying, that it was not worth the trouble; or that, if it were, it would only make you uneasy: the two reasons, exactly, which, had I known your temper then, as I do now, would have made me tell you. This kept Clinton in my mind. Yet I did not like him— showy and brilliant, and fascinating, as he was allowed to be—there was a freedom in his manners, which I never liked. Yet it was a novelty; and, as he was a general favourite, I could not well bear to throw him utterly off, at once, while I was the subject of universal envy. At last, I was provoked at your security. You gave yourself no trouble about Clinton. You never asked his name—never met him, and, I have since found, never saw him; though he was with me every day. Do you remember that evening after our pleasure party upon the Delaware? as you stood upon the bank, and a stranger came up to me, in the dim light of the hour, and took my hand, and bade me good night, with the air of an old acquaintance? You were silent for a moment or two, after he had gone; and stepped back, as you saw him take my hand, in a manner that I thought tame. `Lucia,' said you, gravely, when you returned, `he is very intimate with you.' `Yes,' I replied, willing to tease you a little. `Who is he?' said you. `O, one of the finest fellows in the world!' I exclaimed, affecting a great deal more enthusiasm, than I felt; for, as I have told you before, I did not like him —`a universal favourite.' `Indeed!' said you—and were silent, until we parted at the door. There, you lingered a moment. There you spoke to me. I never shall forget either your look or your words. You may have forgotten both. I dare say that you have, but I never shall. The lamp shone upon your face; it was pale as death; and I thought that I could see the traces of weeping about your eyes. My emotions were—what? sorrowful?— Oh no, pleasant beyond all expression. It did my heart good to find you so deeply interested in me, so cruelly disturbed. It began to correspond with my notions of love, and dominion I was a foolish girl then, a coquette by nature.' Said you—O, Archibald! I think that I can see you now, and hear your low, mournful, deep voice counselling me over again—said you. `Lucia—good night? Good night, love. Forgive me, for my silence; I have been troubled. I tremble for you—I tremble for myself. You are too kind hearted. You form your opinions too hastily. I pray heaven that you may never have reason to reproach yourself for it—nor to — to — to —, (your voice grew indistinct,—`good night! good night! dear Lucia!' After this, I said no more; and thought no more of Clinton. My disposition had altered; and I began to look upon you, as my future husband. Yet your solitary, thoughtful habit; your youth; and, above all, that haughty exteriour of yours which repelled all kindness that came not from the known hand of two or three, alarmed me. It was at this time, while I truly loved you; but began to doubt whether you loved me, or was capable of loving any woman, or any thing on this earth, except your books; and, while the remembrance of your former tenderness had begun to be, like that of a dream to me; for my very nature appeared to be changed, that Clinton reappeared. His manner was frank and noble. He dealt fairly with me for awhile; but I did not so with him— when I did, it was too late. Archibald—I am no wanton. I was never made for a harem or seraglio. God never meant me to be the mistress of any man. I was made for a wife, and a mother. Believe me—O, believe me, Archibald! if you would not have my poor heart expire with shame and mortification. At last, I found that our intercourse, hitherto so innocent, had begun to assume a mysteriousness, that was full of excitement and terrour. We conversed by signals; we corresponded, before your eyes; and, in the presence of the whole family, with books and cards. Yet, all this while, though my heart smote me, at times, I was not, nor did I mean to be unfaithful to you, if you would claim me. But you did not; you smiled, and your smile was full of bitterness. Clinton persuaded me that it was contempt. He pretended to love me; to counsel me; and, I had already gone too far—much too far— not to be growing giddy with the peril of my course. At last—O, Archibald—I could weep myself blind at the thought—but, it has been told once, and I can only allude to it. I was not fully aware of my danger till—I found that, should he forget himself, I had no hope left. He was in my room; how should that be explained?—again, he was there—and again—for I dared not provoke him—yet I was not altogether unworthy, no, not then—nor—no, Archibald—not till —faint with excess of terrour, and passion, from some slight of yours, I awoke from a troubled dream about you, and found myself in the arms of a man—I shrieked —I—' `No matter—you have known it all. But you do not know, that he—he alone, prevented me from destroying myself. What could I do. I did not love him? But, could I ever look you, whom I did love, in the face again? —never! never—I was a guilty creature, but not guilty, oh no, not guilty to the consummation of my shame—I—I—how I am able to write it at all, is a matter of wonder to me. I am astonished at my own calmness. But, bear with me for a moment, that you may know the whole truth. `I loved you—more than ever; because I felt that I was unworthy of you; that I had injured you. Clinton was penitent, I am sure—terribly penitent; for he offered me, immediately, all the atonement in his power, upon his knees. I took one night to think of it; only one, and resolved to marry him.—Aye, though it was like lashing myself to something detestable, after this event. Yes, and I should have married him, but for his own perverse, foolish, and precipitate nature. He triumphed too easily. I might be humbled, surprised, shamed; but I could not be trampled on. I awoke, as from a trance. I compared you togther. I wondered at my infatuation, wept and prayed. From that hour, my resolution was formed; happen what would —I would not marry him—nor you---nor anybody—die, if there were no other means of concealing my shame— and—' `But heaven hath seen fit to spare me the guilt of murder—the guilt of self murder—the blood of innocence, my own blood. You slew him. I forgive you for it. I forgave you then. Though I—I would have protected him, at the peril of my life; for, hateful as he was to me, on some accounts for his ruffian passion, yet, on others, he was very dear to me—as the only husband that I should ever wed. After this, it was owing to yourself, to your own continued importunity, that I told the secret. I could not kill you—I did not scorn you. I could not bear that you should believe my refusal of you, to be owing to my horrour of `Clinton's murderer,' as you were pleased to call yourself; nor to my love of Clinton. Nay, there may have been another feeling, not so praise worthy, as the desire of dealing with truth, to influence me. I knew that I had done that, which few women upon this earth, since its creation, could have done, or would; and, I was willing that you should know it. I knew that your blood would thrill, your eyes flash fire; that you might go mad at the recital, but I knew also---for your nature is known to me, better than to any other living creature, I am sure, that you would, if you survived the shock, feel a passion for me, altogether more sublime and elevating, than that of love. It would be wonder and admiration. I have lived to find that true. I can now die contented. You have been willing to espouse me. Archibald---I thank God that I have lived to hear the proposal; to see it in black and white. I never should have believed it, else. But I thank God, yet more devoutly that he has given me the strength to resist the temptation; and to say---as I do say—no, Archibald, no---did I love thee less, it might be. But I will bear children to no man, who cannot lay his hands upon their forehead, and pray to God that they may resemble their mother!— LUCIA. Farewell!—I do pray that we may depart together—Farewell!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XII. `What are these mighty phantoms which I see `Floating around me? `Haughty, and high, and beautiful, and full `Of seeming strength.' Cain. Not long after this conversation; within two or three days, I believe; for, I remember well, that the pleasant eyes of Ellen were near me; and I was comparing them with the mysterious loveliness of Lucia's, who had just been weeping, as I held her hands, and blessed hers, with all my soul, for her noble and generous confidence, wondering as I did, that she should look so beautiful, even yet; so pure—and hallowed---that I dared not breathe, even to her, another word upon the tale of sorrow—there came several letters, chiefly dated anteriour to the packet, of which I have already spoken, and one which was dated since. That was from Copely. It related a terrible disaster to our cavalry; and ran thus— `We have had the devil to pay. Archibald is taken prisoner. Arthur narrowly escaped; with two or three sabre cuts, not worth mentioning. Sir Henry Clinton is carrying all before him; and poor Sullivan, never was mortal man so put to it! notwithstanding his generalship, he is tied up, hand and foot, by Cornwallis and Clinton. We were sent out, with a few hundred regulars, and a few rascally militia, to keep open a route at Monk's corner, for Lincoln to retreat by when he could do no better. But Tarleton, would that Arthur or Archibald could meet him, face to face, for a few minutes: my notion is that he would never get through his six divisions again. I say nothing for myself, for this twist in my neck has become confoundedly troublesome of late; and I am nothing to be compared with Archibald, as a swordsman. By the way ---Archibald looks altogether better than when we wrote last, and we begin to have hope; but he has none; or, if he have any, he will not own it; he only smiles, patiently, when we speak of what may be, like one that feels the principles of vitality going out, one after the other, in his heart.' `But, to the scuffle. General Clinton thought fit, day before yesterday, to pack off about fifteen hundred men to bring us in, dead or alive. Tarleton's legion was with them—a legion of devils, to be sure; for he rides over horse and foot, with them at his heels. But, we shall remember him, and, if it be God's will, there may be a change of wind one day or other.' `The first intelligence that we had of his approach, was the sight of three of our videttes, at full speed; two of whom were cut down in our sight, and the third, followed into camp; we had no time to do our duty. We were literally ridden down. The bullets rattled about our harness, like hail, for a moment; and then, before we could make a movement, or gain ground enough for a charge, half of our men were unhorsed and rolling in the dirt; Arthur among the rest; but he gave a pretty account, I am told, of three or four of the fellows about him. They rode down, all at once, upon him; and— there they are yet. Our troop broke; and, by the trumpet, were ordered to the woods, whence most of them escaped under Colonel Washington. But Archibald, after having rallied a few, was attracted by the cries of women, to one of the dwellings; he stove in the door of the house; and rode, through and through it, with about a dozen men; and there, in the heat and smoke, on horseback and on foot, with the pistols ringing in at his ears; the enemy without firing in the windows; and the wretched women, within, shrieking VOL. II. 17 in the arms of their ravishers, the gallant, glorious Archibald set fire to the house; slew, with his own hand one of the ruffians; and, amid a general hourra and explosion, rescued three lovely creatures, in the moment of their extremest peril. But the rescue was only from the flame and smoke; the roof fell in, ere the brave fellows had cleared the garden wall; and, three or four of their horses, that were actually within the house, came thundering through the sides of it, their manes all on fire, and furniture ringing; and the enemy, who gave way for a moment, and held up their hands, at the terrible beauty of the spectacle, immediately contracted about him and his few followers, reduced to five or six now, on foot; and about as many more on horseback, and took them prisoners. He fought to the last moment; and fell, at length, exhausted with blood, and stifled with heat. But we have heard not ten minutes ago, that he is in no danger. It is for that reason that I write you. I was unwilling to begin a letter, until I knew his fate. He is the talk of the whole army; nay, of the two armies. They say that his beautiful hair was burnt off; his clothes burnt to a coal; and that one of the women whom he saved, is a creature of singular beauty and—but hush, we shall be dreaming treason, before we know it. It is too late now, I am sure, for beauty to dream of sharing in the dominion of death. Yet bear up; let him die! let me die! let us all die! it is nothing—nothing, so that we have done worthily. Let us learn to look death in the face. It is cowardly to shut our eyes. Arthur, as I told you, had a narrow escape. He had a dear friend slaughtered under his very eyes; but Arthur avenged him; and poor Bernie—(Major Bernie was his name—) was literally swimming in the blood of his murderers, before Arthur would permit himself to think of safety; but then, a horse happened to dash by him, a noble beast, he is before the tent now— Arthur sprang into the saddle, under a shower of balls from the infantry, and before a dozen horsemen; but he escaped, and joined us within an hour. `I had a strange dream last night. I hope that it is true. Give the enclosed to Ellen; and, if it be not true, bid her to pray for me, that it may be, if not now —that is, if it be too late, now—that it may be true, at some future day. I dreamt that I was a father; that my babe was a boy—a giant, with the palest blue eyes in the world; and a lip—the young rascal! so like his mother's—that, when the rough hand of Arthur past over my mouth, to awaken me, for another battle—I kissed it again and again, under the notion that it was Emwa's. What shall be his name—Archibald, I say.' And how comes on your little ones? If I remember rightly, John, you were in the hope of some young horsemen, born, I suppose, saddled and bridled—I—I— curse it, I cannot trifle. That girl has spoilt me. I must stop—it may be—it may—O, God, have compassion upon me, and avert the owen; it may be, that, while I am jesting about my boy, I have neither boy— nor girl—nor wife—Oadley, farewell—I cannot write another line, my heart is too full.—Write! in mercy, write! COPELY. Santee, April 16, 1780. The letter to Ellen; and one, which we received the same day for Mary, contained an account of another affair with the cavalry, in which Copely had been wounded, and about forty of our men cut to pieces, or taken prisoners, by the impetuous Tarleton. Lincoln too was vehemently pressed. And, ere we could recover from these apprehensions, there came, successively, to us the account of Lincoln's surrender; the humiliating terms imposed upon him; and the destruction of a part of the Virginia line, by Tarleton, who behaved in a manner, for which there is no doubt that he has been haunted by devils ever since—no man ever deserved it better. It was a scene of merciless, cold blooded, taunting butchery. The men of his troop literally practised their cuts upon our unarmed, bare headed and kneeling militia, after they had surrendered—thrusting them through the face, and hacking, piece after piece, from their arms and legs. All this looked so like having overrun the country, that Sir Henry Clinton, after a few more depredations of a like nature, determined to return to New York. Mistaken man!—the elements of death were concocting in silence. Disasters made us stronger. We fell, only to rise, like Antœus, with renewed power. It was success that ruined us—enervated us—calamity only made us the more terrible. The tories of the south had been overrated; the republicans much underrated. They were impatient for a trial of strength. A general dissatisfaction began to prevail under the administering loyalty of Cornwallis. The countenances of men looked stern; their hands were clenched; and these symptoms of a troubled spirit were punished and denounced, as downright rebellion. Gates had been ordered to the south. The sun broke out!—But Gates was defeated, shamefully defeated; and a series of calamities and disheartening events followed, in such rapid succession, at the south, that I began to think seriously of mounting my horse again, and, feeble as I was—leaving all that I loved, helpless and alone behind me, to strike one more blow at the enemy, though I died for it. Then came the treachery of Arnold; the execution of Andre; the trial of General Gates; the operation of Greene at the south—offering a changeable map, of encouragement and terrour, to the eyes of our stout hearted countrymen. Still we had no news from Archibald; nay, we knew not whether he was living or dead. But Washington was in negociation for an exchange of prisoners; and our cavalry, at the south, had begun to retaliate upon Tarleton. At last, there was a dreary interval of some months during which, we heard no direct intelligence, whatever, from Arthur, Copely, or Archibald. Our apprehension became terrible. We were sick at the heart; and heaven only knows, what might have happened to us, had not a line in Arthur's hand, come to us at last, as we sat together, on a cold, wintry evening, the first of March, 1781. Let that evening never be forgotten in our blood or name—never! Let it be a jubilee! My heart bounds now, at the thought of our rapid and tumultious transition, from despondency to joy. We have set it apart, for tears, and prayer, and thanksgiving. My boy was about a year old; as heavy and fine a little fellow as ever cuddled in the bosom of a mother. We were weary and cold. Poor Clara sat near me, upon a low stool—leaning her elbow upon my knee, and rocking the cradle, where Copely's little daughter, and poor James lay, cheek to check, breathing like matted honeysuckles. Ellenour, whose whole character had changed, of late, to a deeper melancholy and apprehensiveness, was gazing, all the while, upon her babe; her sweet eyes running over with involuntary tears; and Lucia, the blessed sufferer, was reading aloud to us, from the Bible: her voice, always full of pathos and tenderness: her modulation, always full of delicate and expressive sensibility: her tones and emphasis, always those of passion, simplicity and eloquence, as the subject demanded either the one or the other—were now so sweet and thrilling, that we sat and listened to her, with our lips apart, as to musick coming out of the grass. `What a source of perpetual consolation it is,' said Mrs. Arnauld, laying her hand reverently upon the blessed book. `Yes,' said her husband, in a low voice; `weak and erring as we are; full of infirmities; liable to transgression and sorrow, from the cradle to the grave; yet, is there in that book, what he, who has once tasted of it—though broken-hearted and abandoned of all the world, will never forget; but will turn to, like the unweaned child to the bosom, whence it hath drawn its nourishment, and draw it again, while tears and sobs are choaking him. Lucia! dear Lucia—what troubles you?' VOL. II. 17* A faint smile played over her pallid features; and I saw that the picture, which her father had drawn, of a child nestling in the bosom of a mother, drawing warmth and life from the sweet fountain of the pure in heart; and the two sleeping babes before her—were— it was not envy; yet, there was a sorrowful sweetness in the dark of her eyes, which, told me, but too plainly, what was the cause of that trouble which her father spoke of. `Dear Lucia,' said my mother, leaning over her lap, and looking her in the face; `read on. There, we may find consolation; they, that have leaned upon a spear may be healed there; they, that are broken and bruised, may find wine and oil there; the flower of the grass that perisheth; the beauty, that the sun and the wind have scattered, may revive again, if—nay, dear, why do you weep? our sorrow is not past bearing.' Mr. Arnauld arose, and walked up to his daughter, and stood by her side, and pressed her white, transparent forehead to his bosom. `Lucia!' he said, in a voice almost inarticulate with emotion; `why will you break my heart! Am I to stand, forever, before my wasting child, and see her fading away—dying, hour by hour, of some mysterious malady, which I—I—Lucia—I— Take comfort, my child—take comfort. It is good for us to be afflicted. We know nothing evil yet, with certainty. I do not attempt to flatter you. I cannot; there is little ground for hope. I say it to all of you, my children; and, while I invite you all to join with me, and, laying your hands together, upon that book, to put up your petitions for their safety, to Him that watcheth over the widow and the orphan; while I do this; nay, while I say to you, in the sincerity of my heart—a broken heart, my dear ones, broken by your sorrow, and crushed by the weight of ancient transgression— let us be prepared for the worst—the worst! yet, do I entreat you to remember, that God is good; that all his ways are best and wisest; that—arise my children, and let us kneel together! and once more pray for them that are away, in the battle, or in the place of death.' We did kneel. We knelt together; and we prayed together, till the sound of sobbing and distress grew fainter and fainter; and were just rising, with the tears of penitence and submission upon our cheek, when a tap was heard at the door. Some little disorder followed; for the best are more than half ashamed, to be caught at their devotion; and it was some moments before the door was opened—and a stranger, treading and looking like a soldier, entered, cap in hand, holding a letter to Mr. Arnauld. `Sit down, my friend,' said Mr. Arnauld to him, as a faint cry broke from every lip in the room, except mine; but the stranger remained standing. Mr. Arnauld took the letter; while the dark eye of the veteran, (for, though he was a middle aged man, and evidently of the ranks, there was the air and authority of age upon him,) went, slowly, from face to face of the little group about him, without any change of expression, till it lighted upon Lucia; when his lip trembled—and he put his hand into his bosom, and then hesitated, and sat down, as if undecided whether to speak or not. `My children,' said Mr. Arnauld, in a pleasant tone; `the hand writing is one that I know; nay— nay—be patient—compose yourselves. Are you prepared? It is the writing of—' A murmur dropped from all their lips—except Lucia's: she sat like a marble woman—like something, over which life and death—emotion and change had lost their power. `Of Arthur Rodman.' `O, my husband! my husband!' said Mary, who had not opened her mouth before—and then fell back into her chair, almost powerless. The stranger passed the back of his large hand athwart his eyes; and shook the March rain out of the bear-skin cap, that he held in his hand, and compressed his lip, with a loud hem—as if that rain had blinded him, and then sat down. Mr. Arnauld read the letter; his agitation growing at every line, more and more evident, till, at last, the letter fell from his hands, while the tears were running out of his shut eyes, as if his very heart were overflowing with pleasure and thankfulness. Mary moved timidly toward the letter, looking up to him, with her lips apart, as if fearing a reproof. `Nay—nay, dear,' said Mr. Arnauld, catching her hands, `nay—I cannot bear, that you should be the first to know what has happened.' He then took up the letter, and began to read; while we sat, hand in hand, holding by each other, and feeling every pleasant word, at the same moment, like a thrill of electricity. (The Letter.) `I am well—very well. We have retaliated upon the enemy, and I shall get leave, if I can, to visit you—' Mary's head fell upon the bosom of my mother. —`We have had a severe battle, and beaten Tarleton like men. The particulars, I have no time to relate. The bearer, my friend—' The stranger shifted his position, and appeared uneasy—crossed his legs, and played with the collar of his coat. —`To whom you will prove, I believe, that you know how to appreciate the favour, has saved my life. He will tell you all about it—' `No he wont,' said the stranger, muttering impatiently, while Mary arose, and tottered to him. `I—I—' said she, `I do not ask your name— but, (giving to him, her two hands, while his strong features and dark eyes, were illuminated with surprise and delight,) you have saved the life of my husband. God will reward you for it! I will—I— Will you accept of this—this, to remember me by,' (offering him a locket, that she wore.) The stranger started back, and stood haughtily before her. `No, ma'm—no! I'll accept of nothing. I did my duty—I— Yes— I will— I— Give me a little lock o' your hair. I— my children shall have it; and when your children want their blood, they shall have that.' My mother clipped off a lock, and put it into his hands. The soldier, with a look of embarrassment, that sat amazingly well upon his sunburnt countenance, while Mr. Arnauld smiled, was about packing it away in some old continental money—ragged and dirty; when a sudden thought seemed to strike him; he laid down his cap, stood over it, swung his arms to and fro, for a moment, and then broke out, into the following strange, broken, but feeling ejaculation. `No—no—'twon't do—'twon't do—mustn't find it there— Say — what may come o' this? Faith, I'll give it to him! No, I wont. Will he like it? will he? What! haven't I paid dear enough for it? by —p'shaw—what o' that! he'd save my life, too. No, I won't have it—can't keep it—take it back. I shall lose it, if I'm taken, or killed in battle; and then—stop—I'll hide it here, (ripping open his sword-belt, as if utterly unconscious that there was another soul within hearing,) there! there! now let any man touch me—or the major—or the cap'un —or the cap'un's wife—or—ah, pretty creatures! (stooping to the cradle,) ah, God bless them! so like my little biddies—chuck! chuck!—which is your'n? If I may be so bold. I— lord! that's he—I'd know my cap'un's boy, among a thousand—chuck! chuck! bobby! chuck!' Who could forbear laughing? The honest fellow's eyes were running over; and he had kissed Ellen's little daughter, twenty times, before we had leisure to remark the reddening confusion of the mother; or the sweet embarrassment of Ellen, who had twice put out her hand, to pluck him away from the cradle; and then withdrew it, quietly, trembling and colouring from head to foot. `Hey, Rodman, hey! my fine fellow! Faith! as like as two peas. Eyes!—nose—hair—ho, Rodman! chuck! The whole troop 'ould know you. The very picture of the captain! Gorry! what a fellow for a saddle!' This was too much; we all laughed together, to see the little girl sitting upon his arm, as he caught her out of the cradle, and began tossing her about; while her sweet eyes were just beginning to fill, and her face to pucker, in the blaze of the fire-light, and the natural fretfulness of children, when waked out of a sound sleep. Yet she did not cry; perhaps, because she was too much terrified; or, perhaps, the incressant motion of his arms prevented her. But at last, Mr. Arnauld was fain to interfere; just, it was evident, as she was beginning to clear her pipes for a squall; and the mother sat laughing, for the first time, for many a week, as if she would kill herself, at the confusion of Mary. `My good friend,' said Mr. Arnauld, looking as seriously as he could—and placing the little creature in the arms of Ellen, where, after turning its eyes for a moment, at the stranger, like a mouse that has escaped from a cat—and quivering all over—with its little mouth wide open—its pretty head fell on one side, and it was sobbing itself asleep immediately. `My good friend—I—' And there he stopped, as if unwilling to mortify the honest fellow, by a disclosure of so untimely a truth— `have you supped?—' `No Sir—that I haven't; not a mouthful has entered my jaws, since yesterday mornin.' A table was instantly spread; and Mr. Arnauld continued reading the letter. `His name is Hanson. The particulars of the letter he will detail to you. Archibald has struck a blow that—' `Archibald,' said all of us, together. `Hush! hush!' said Mr. Arnauld, seeing that we were about to overwhelm Hanson with questions—`let him finish his meal; and then you shall worry him to your heart's content.' `By your leave,' said Hanson—falling at once upon a loaf, as it passed him on the waiter. `Let me draw my rations in my own way.' `Certainly, certainly,' said Mrs. Arnauld, assisting to arrange the table—while Mr. Arnauld continued to read, as follows. `Archibald has struck a blow, that the enemy will never forget, to his dying day. The affair of Monk's corner, with twenty other scrapes, of the same kind, is fairly balanced by this of the Cowpens. Tarleton himself narrowly escaped; Washington was so close to him, at one time, that they exchanged several cuts, with what effect, we do not yet know. My last, I hope, apprised you of Archibald's situation. I would have you prepare yourself for a severe shock. You will scarcely know him.' Copely cannot write, till his hand is better; he orders me to say, all that mortal man should say to such a `pestilent little creature, (his very words) as'— `Me! I dare say,' cried his wife,—`but I forgive him—bless the creature—is he well?' `Read on, pray read on, my dear Sir,' said Mary, faintly—`what else?' `I shall write further, before Hanson departs, unless—' `Unless what?' said Lucia, seeing her father hesitate, and struggle, as if to suppress some violent tumult of joy—while he folded the paper—`father! father —is that all?' Mr. Arnauld shook his head—and turned to Hanson, who sat, so as to keep his eye upon the door, at which he kept continually glancing, whenever it opened, as if he expected somebody else to appear; we saw it, and smiled, for the table was already loaded with fare; and we attributed his anxiety to the natural longing of a famished man—he said to him. `Did you receive any other letter?' `No,' said Hanson, significantly—`no, sir—no other letter.' Mr. Arnauld breathed more audibly; his whole countenance changed to a natural, steady tranquillity— nearly religious. I say nearly, for, even in the most pious ministering of Arnauld, upon his knees, there was a want of natural lowliness; a want of that beautiful truth, which early habit in religious indulgence will produce upon the manner of men; and which, open a better habit, when the countenance is written all over with the mysterious and deep language of passion, and passionate thought, aye, and worldly experience, can never entirely predominate, however deeply the heart may be affected. There was a long and breathless silence of some minutes; during which, there was much pleasant weeping, and pious, inward aspiration, interrupted only by the hearty smack of Hanson's lips—now and then, as he plucked away the exhausted tankard from his mouth, with a strong hand; or the rattling of his knife and fork; which, at any other time, in its vivacity, would have diverted us not a little. Many of the flourishes were there of a swordsman, I saw; and, before he threw it down, and drew a long breath—pushed back his chair, and wiped his mouth, I should have known that he was a great hand at a sabre. `Well,' said Mr. Arnauld—looking at Hanson, who, though crowded to the throat with the hearty cheer— could not forbear following every movement of the girl, that cleared away the table, with a piteous look; now and then, shifting his position; sucking his lips; and, passing his broad hand down his waiscoat; and sitting more upright; as if he thought, that, by a little jolting and good management, he should be able to stow away some odd pounds more, nevertheless. It was in vain to ask any questions for some time; his movements were too unsteady; his sorrowful, half uttered ejaculations were so numerous; as dish after dish went away, till, at last, by his continual hitching, he found himself along side of the table again, just as the girl was taking away the large tankard of cider. `Stop,' said Hanson—`I can't bear that, my pretty dear—one swallow more!' The poor girl was in the middle of the apartment; but, seeing him start out of his chair, and wipe his lips with his cuff; and not rightly understanding his motive; and, perhaps too, ashamed at his manner all the while that she had been clearing away the table; and thinking that his broken ejaculation had more reference to herself, (a natural thought for a young, blooming, country girl,) than to the supper; she stood still, with such an aspect of terrour and submission, shame and embarrassment, that, when Hanson came near enough to her, and then, instead of kissing her, as she certainly expected; and for which she had prepared herself, to see him catch at the tankard, utterly unconscious of her proximity to it; and then her mortification —it was altogether too much for our composure. We could bear it no longer. Here was an excuse, such as we wanted; and the suppressed laughter of all the evening, now broke out, all at once! peal after peal! till Mr. Arnauld was fain to put a stop to it, by main force. `I am really ashamed of you,' said he, seeing us all ready to break out again, just as Hanson drew away the tankard from his lips—looked into it, with a sorrowful eye; turned it bottom upward; counted the drops that fell—shaking his head all the while; and then returned it to the poor girl; whom, I verily believe, he had not seen till then, for the colour ran instantly all over his face, and he made an awkward military bow and scrape, which somewhat appeased poor Kitty. `What was this affair of the Cowpens?' said Mr. Arnauld, `were you there?' `Were I there?—Yes. I'll tell him—capital cider that—capital!' VOL. II. 18 `Another tankard,' said Arnauld, nodding to Kitty, as she went out. `D'ye see,' continued Hanson—sitting erect in his chair, and following the girl with his eyes; `d'ye see, we'd got into a hobble; trenched up—Cornwallis was arter us, on one side; Leslie on t'other; and Tarleton, fiend take him! he was gallopin all over the country: So Morgan backed out, and we'd got to the Cowpens. `Hanson!' said the major to me. I was always a favourite with the major, after we escaped from the enemy.' `Major who?' said Arnauld. `Why, Major Oadley,' said Hanson, `to be sure.' `What! is he a major? I thought that he was only a captain.' `You mean his brother, Capt'un Jonathan: I mean Major—Major Archibald. Pray ma'm, (seeing Lucia turn pale.) maybe you're his wife, that he used to talk about in his fever—his—ah— very well! I say nothen; but Archibald Oadley is the boy, what might make any woman turn pale—he—he— hey?—I —' `You spoke of his escape—how was it?' `Well—(the yankees, and Hanson was a yankee, had the practice of prefacing almost every remark, and every question, and every answer, then, as now, with a well, or a why)—`after he got well, they let him go out on parol; and, one night some of 'em run off; and, he might a' gone—but he would'nt—out 'pon honour, he said—so he would'nt—never mind 'em— they braced him up—served him all the same as the rest—now look out, said he—I'm clear o' my word, now—keep me, if you can—so, not a week after, we escaped—see here—(showing his wrist—) `I had a bay onet through, there—and here, and here---the balls whistled like hail; they sent hundreds arter us, through the bushes—but we got clear—guns!' `When was this, Hanson?' `Well—about—let me see—August's one—September's two—October—say six months.' `Six months! and why did he not write?' said I. `Why, he did write, I saw him write a dozen letters to you; and, you (bowing archly to Lucia)—you, for he cried like a child, when—I beg pardon—capital cider! guns!—what cider!' `Never mind,' said Mr. Arnauld, smiling—`so, now for the battle.' `Well—said the Major, says he—speaking to me —`Hanson, damn my blood—' `Does he swear?' said Lucia,— `Why—no; only with his eyes—don't say that he said, damn my blood, ma'am; but, he looked— looked it, ma'am, as plain as—as—as two and two makes four. Guns! how he flourished his sword about —best broadsword in the army—says he, Hanson, we must score off some o' their cuts? what say you? If Tarleton should fall in our way, remember who used to starve us, while we were prisoners; and, curse us, and beat us; and, leave us rotting in filth and nastiness, with bread full of pounded glass, and maggotty meat, that made the water hiss, when it touched it. Guns! give it ten yards o' start, and I'd bet on it agin a three year old cat. You could'nt keep it still, could'nt catch it. So, we were all on horse back; had jest come in, and Morgan was just encampin on our left. All at once—hourra! we heard a number of scatterin shot; and, seed two or three of our videttes scampering, like devils, up the hill, and along the bank of the river—then, two or three volleys. `Tarleton! Tarleton!' cried the major. `Tarleton! Tarleton!' bawled the troop—In less than five minutes, Colonel Washington, Lieutenant Colonel Copely, and Captain Rodman came to their places, crying.—Remember the prison ship! remember Monk's corner! Remember the tories!—when Tarleton broke down upon our rear—and we were stunned with the artillery. I say nothin Sir, nothin of what I saw, except that, in the thick o' the battle, when you could see the faces of our troop, through the smoke, by the sparkles of their own swords—I heard Colonel Copely laughin; and, saw him, as he cut down a tall fellow close by me, rein up, and burst out into a loud laugh, at one of the blundering rascals, who had just exchanged a cut with him, and then rid off, frightened out of his wits. Captain Rodman too, did famously; but the major!—well—Guns! how he rattled away at 'em!—hey—no quarter—none!—It soon became a race—whoop! Morgan's riflemen peppered 'em, fore and aft, well—the horse tumbled together, in heaps; while Colonel Howard, the Maryland boy, with some of the raw Virginians, blazed away before 'em, so that the horses were frightened with the noise. We killed about a hundred on 'em; took five hundred prisoners; and some dragoon horses; about a hundred, was jest what we wanted. So, you see, they got a sound drubbin.' `And how long was this? how long ago?' said Mr. Arnauld. `Why—there was a matter of—' Another tap was heard at the door. `I pray, you ladies,' said Hanson, jumping up, with a change of deportment, that startled us---`I pray you ----be prepared for a serious trial'—to which Mr. Arnauld nodded. The door opened. `Rodman! Rodman! Arthur! Arthur!' shouted all of us, at the same moment, while, after a little interval, another faint voice followed—`O, Arthur! Arthur--- my husband!' `Mary! love!' said the princely fellow, putting us all aside with his arms, and rushing to his wife, and taking her out from the midst of us, like a giant---and standing over her, like one tranced; while she clung about his neck and sobbed aloud. There was not a dry eye in the room; not one!---- Hanson himself snuffled; and unbuttoned his jacket; while Arthur, hearing nobody, seeing nobody but Mary, stood over her, holding her cold face to his bosom; and, watching the bright tears that trickled over her lips. What could we do? we were a family of love; all our sorrow, and all the sources of it, were known alike to all---all, I should say, save one---the sorrow of Lucia was her own; untold—unguessed at, but by me. We would have left the newly met; the desolate; the widowed and widow—to weep, if it might he, with joy, unprofaned by our presence---but, no, we had no time for it. Arthur was standing erect, his majestick person abundantly heightened by his close uniform and martial carriage; his browned features radiant with intelligence; and his soldier-like head, and manner, as he stood upright, before his delicate, timid, and innocent Mary, who looked so lovingly so imploringly up to him, absolutely awed us. I was half afraid to speak to him. How he had changed!---`How know we,' said the eyes of one to another---`how know we, that he is the same Arthur Rodman, whom we knew? nay, he is not the same; he is an altered man; sterner, and taller; even his beautiful hair is withered and blighted; his voice too, that is not the voice of his boyhood.' `Heaven bless you all,' said he, recollecting for the first time, that his trooper's harness was yet upon him; his tall ruffian cap that darkened half the room; and, that he was drenched with the cold, uncomfortable rain of the season. So, throwing aside his sword belt, sword and cap; he seated himself, just as he used to, before our great fire, and rubbed his knees, with that expression of comfort, which we see in them that have travelled long in the wind, his face flushed, his heart full, and every eye glistening upon him, and every tongue unable to articulate one of a thousand questions, that it had meditated. `Supper!' said Mrs. Arnauld, `supper again?' `Yes,' said Hanson, `if you would save trouble, you will let it stand all night long—there may be other guests,' (significantly.) `Oh,' replied Mr. Arnauld, taking out the letter again, and reading a line or two, which he had omitted; `no—he says nothing of the others—can it be?' VOL. II. 18* Hanson nodded, and Lucia turned deadly pale, as we heard the trampling of hoofs by the window—and the ring of a broadsword, upon the flagged pavement in the yard—as if somebody leaped down from a horse. `Archibald;' cried she, starting from her chair. `O no! no—it is my husband! mine!' shrieked Ellen, rushing forward, with her girl in her arms, just as Copely entered. Here was another blow for us. What were we to think! Our hearts and eyes reeled at his entrance; might there not be another, yet another! our lips were all apart, as Copely caught his wife and babe at the same moment. `Nell! by Jupiter,' he cried, laughing; `why, what is the simpleton crying at? Whose brat is that? mine! mine! hourra! hourra!' Saying this, he caught the little girl in his arms, and began capering about the room, like a mad creature—laughing and kising it by turns, for several minutes, while Ellen ran after him, endeavouring to catch at the child, and half choked by her own sobs: and Hanson clapped his hands, and tumbled over tables and chairs in his rapture—imitating, unconsciously, as if he had an invisible babe in his own arms, every movement of Copely, as he ran, hither and thither, tossing the child about. Another step, a— I know not what she saw; but Lucia tottered through the door—rushed out into the rain and darkness; and, a few minutes after, we heard her fall, and a faint groan reached us. Her father ran out: and, while we stood awaiting her return, and wondering at her sudden delirium—the two husbands unable to move, from their clinging wives, Archibald came in, faint, and pale—following Mrs. Arnauld, with the lifeless body of Lucia in his arms, just I had seen them years before. I was appalled. Archibald looked like a ghost—so pale—so ghastly pale, and thin; but withal, strangely beautiful; as if, while his body thinned and waned— the spirit of him, became more visible—as if, the nearer it was to death, the body became but the more and more intensely animate with his spirit. It was, as if his heart and soul were transparent before me. Lucia's insensibility continued so long, that we were all thrown into a stillness and consternation, so terririble, as to prevent our recognition of each other. `She is dead,' said Archibald, with a patient lifting of his deep blue eyes; `she is dead, brother—' I took his hand. It was cold as death; and when I looked upon his face, the wan forehead—hollow temples, ridged all over with his large blue veins—his fresh lips, alternately white as ashes, and then, of a deep blood colour, as the rapid emotion of his heart came and went, hither and thither, over his face—I felt as if I were suffocating. `Yes—yes,' he replied, in a low voice, bending down, over the broken hearted mother, upon whose lap the beautiful, dead face of his beloved lay, like that of one suddenly struck down in prayer. `O Lucia!—' Her eye-lids quivered, at the sound of his voice: a sweet smile broke, like that of a sleeping infant, about her gentle lips, hitherto so haughty; and their motion was audible, as if they articulated his name. All eyes were upon her: all, I should say, but those of Hanson, who, unable to support the terrible conflict longer, had withdrawn, leaving us, like mourners, standing about the blessed sufferer, as she lay lifeless— helpless, and worn out. `Lucia! o' Lucia!' said Archibald, holding her hand, to his heart, with convulsive eagerness; and stooping over her, as if to catch the first murmur of her mouth. She drew a long breath, half opened her eyes, while the tears ran slowly down through her redundant hair, upon which her face lay, half buried—and pronounced his name. A slight shivering followed; and, in a few minutes, amid the dead stillness of all about, she arose, and sat up, and put her two hands into his—saying. `Archibald, I can now die in peace—I have only waited for you.' `And I, Lucia,' he replied, kissing her forehead— while the tears gushed out again at the pressure, and her red lips thrilled and trembled with pleasure. `I have come to you for no other purpose, than to—' `To close my eyes, Archibald? Heaven bless you! heaven bless you for it! O, mother, do not break my heart upon the spot. Why will you sob and weep, so distractedly? Is not this, what I have always told you? always? Have I not said; father—mother—sister—brother— there is no hope! God hath heard my prayer: His hand hath stayed me. I do not desire to live. I do not deserve it. He hath upheld me, till now, that I might see Archibald—dear Archibald, once more. O, Archibald! how I have wept for you!' `And I,' said he, in a solemn, sweet voice—like one summoned by something invisible—dreading it not, and ready to depart, whenever it shall please heaven. `I, dear Lucia, have wept and prayed, many a night through, for you. Let us be firm—the little time that is left to us—I—' `What! is there no hope—none for you, Archibald?' said the dying girl, kissing his hands with uplifted eyes—and watching the changes of his face. `None, dear—none. The malady is incurable. I—' `Hush,' said Mr. Arnauld, `have done with this, my children. It is impious, vain, and ungrateful. You know not what death is, coming upon you in stillness, slowly—and perpetually.' `Do I not!' said Archibald, calmly—putting his hand through his brown beautiful hair, and wringing out the moisture, as if it had been the heavy March rain. `Do I not? It is not rain, Sir,—it is the sweat of death—a night sweat, that hath been upon me, for more than a year. I—' `Hush—in mercy, hush!' cried Clara.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XIII. `Of Death—? Although I know not what it is, `Yet it seems horrible. I have looked out `In the vast desolate night in, search of him— `I watched for what I thought his coming; for, `With fear, rose longing in my heart, to know `What 'twas which shook us all—' `Do you really believe, sister,' said Clara, `really and truly, that there is no hope?' She was leaning over the chair of Lucia, about a week after the last conversation, while I sat, ruminating upon the awful events of the past. Archibald passed the window, just as she was going to reply, on horseback. His motion was very feeble and wayward. `How unlike himself!' said Lucia—locking her hands; `when he rode by that window before, he was younger, by many years, in reality; he appeared, ha, how much younger! But sorrow will have way—and where hath she wrought so unsparingly, as upon the countenance of Archibald? Sister, I will answer you. Do not believe the physician—do not. He may be an honest man—a skilful one; but, I know better than he, what that malady is, whose approach is felt by the sufferer; and known to be death. I know, Clara, that there is no help for me. I would have you prepared for it. I die of a broken heart. I do not complain. I cannot. Many weeks—many weeks may pass away, before you are called upon to scatter the white flowers over my grave—white flowers!—no!—let none be scattered there. I—see him!—see him!—two years ago, he would have reined an unbroken colt, as easy as I could direct the motion of that child's arm, (kissing the little fat arm of James, while she spoke)—yet now, the unmanageable creature bears him whither he will —and how. Poor Archibald!—thy proud heart deserved a better fate. Oh!—brother!—brother!' I saw the movement of the animal, but it was too late; and I was unable to move hand or foot, in my terrour, till I saw Archibald, by a sudden effort, which amazed me, rise in the stirrups, and throw himself off, as the furious horse, ran snorting and plunging toward that identical tree, where Archibald had been well nigh dashed to pieces, years before. A servant passed the window, at full speed—another! —and another—with Arthur and Copely:—and we were left, in the terrible suspense, that followed, for several minutes, till we saw Archibald returning on foot, supported between Copely and a servant. He smiled, as he passed her window, and stopped—signifying, with a motion of his hand, that he had something to say. Clara threw up the window. `Do not be alarmed,' said he; `it was a childish notion. I was willing to try my horse, once more, before I parted with him; and he threw me—it is a good lesson to me.' `Are you hurt? dear Archibald?' `Not in the least,' he replied, wiping the sweat from his forehead—`not in the least!—I am, to be sure, a little mortified—but—I have been on horseback, for the last time.' `Shut the window, Clara,' said I—feeling the tears upon my cheek—`it is very cold and bleak, abroad.' `It is, indeed,' said Copely, dashing his hand over his eyes. `Indeed it is—indeed it is,' said Arthur, and Clara, at the same moment. At this time, I was able to move, with tolerable comfort, about the house—and, after sitting where I was for about half an hour, musing upon the beautiful face that lay before me, her large waxen eye lids, fringed with shadow and silkiness; black as midnight —her dark, lively eyes gleaming under them, like some mysterious splendour, about to break upon us, and blind us:—her round, and wonderfully beautiful arm, lying under her cheek:—her magnificent hair, all loose upon the pillow:—and her young bosom just undulating under the pressure of her other hand, as if a hushed infant were there—whom it were death to stir—or waken. She was insensible—or, asleep I thought—but, all the while, tear after tear gathered and dripped, like oozing lustre, from her wet lashes— and her red lips, now and then, vibrated, as if her slumber were very, very happy. After sitting and wondering at her power and loveliness, for half an hour, I should think, without uttering a word, or scarcely breathing aloud, I heard Archibald's voice in the next room, and the sound of lamentation. I went out. `I have been on horseback for the last time, my dear mother,' said he, `and why should I tremble to say so? I know what I say.' `O my son! my son!' answered my mother, looking up in his face, while she leaned upon him, with her old arms about his neck—`do not break my heart, all at once—do not leave, me again.' `Leave you, mother! never! never!' he answered, parting her grey hair with his mouth, and kissing her forehead. `My mother shall close my eyes—my last breath, if it please God, shall be breathed out upon that bosom, where my first tears were shed.' `I'll tell you what it is, Mr. Oadley,' said Mr. Arnauld, disengaging my mother's arms, from his neck, `this is unmanly. There is hope—while there is life, there is hope.' `Yes—while there is life, there is hope'—echoed somebody, afar off. Archibald shook his head. `O, bless you, bless you!'—cried my mother— `bless you for that! Mr. Arnauld.' He continued. `It is your duty to do all that lies in your power for your restoration—is it not?' Archibald bowed. `And to support the spirits of your desolate and aged mother, instead of weighing them down?' `Assuredly,' said Archibald, with serious eyes. `Then let her hear no more of this. Heaven hath not told us at what day, nor hour, the angel of death shall summon us; and, while it is our duty to be prepared for his coming, at all hours, it is not our duty to wear our lives away in apprehension, or—' `Apprehension!' said Archibald mildly. `I have no apprehension of death—none. But, do with me as you please—I will obey you, while I have breath: for my mother's sake, I will live, if God will let me; and do some good before I die—but, I would have you all prepared—you, brother—you, Lucia—(looking about with troubled eyes)—no, she is not here—and you, mother. Where is Lucia?' `Would you see her?' said Mr. Arnauld---`go with me, my son. But, I do pray you, have done with these melancholy anticipations. Let us hear no more of them.' Archibald's countenance changed. `Go with me to Lucia,' said he---`all of you---but first, Hanson, that sword is your's---the horse---that I give to Copely--- furniture and all—I—' `Brother!' I exclaimed, `you behave strangely. I never knew you so regardless of our feeling.' `My dear John,' he said, taking my hand, `I am doing but my duty---no more, believe me. There is no affectation in all this. No, as I hope to see my Maker! But you will have me wear another face. Be it so. I shall obey you. Let us go to Lucia.' We all went together into the room; and found the two children sprawling upon the floor---Ellenour intertwining some wild flowers with the black hair of Lucia ---poor Mary looking, as if she had never known happiness till then; and Clara romping with the baby; and Lucia, herself, full of faint, spiritual self possession. Archibald paused; and lifted his hands in admiration, as he approached her. `By heaven!' he exclaimed, smiling, `I have never seen you so like what you were, that night, when your tresses were loaded with peach blossoms and — ah! —forgive me---I did not mean to distress you. You are a stout hearted girl, Lucia. Give me your hand.' Lucia gave it to him, with a look of doubtful astonishment. `Do not be agitated,' said Archibald---`our friends complain of us. They do not understand our feeling. It is not too much to say, Lucia, that they cannot--- will not. Have you the heart—but, I need not ask it— I know that you have —to—to—' `To what!' said Lucia, firmly—`come nearer, Archibald. There is a wildness in your eyes, that would have terrified me once. What do you meditate?' He said something, in a low whisper—at which a convulsive, tumultuous, bright emotion passed over her whole face. A murmur or two escaped her: she kissed him, mouth to mouth—and the tears sprang sparkling to her open eyes — and then, livid and purple flashes shot over her forehead, as he continued, rising from her embrace, and saying, in a cheerful tone— `We will be sad no longer, love. What say you? —shall we make glad the hearts that are about us?—and, if we must die, die smiling?' `With all my heart,' she replied. `I hate this cold philosophy, that would make the coming of death so dreary, and desolate, and awful. Let us be prepared; but, let us lose no more time in sorrowing.' Again they embraced; and we, arguing blissful things from the rapture that illuminated their faces, as they stood fronting each other, giving out and absorbing light and beauty from their eyes, and lips, and voices, like spiritualites conversing in some unknown way—we were happy beyond expression. From that hour, there was a visible change in their countenances, and deportment. I cannot say that their tread was stronger, in general, or their voices fuller VOL. II. 19 of tenderness and strength—but, at times, they walked as in the morning of their days; and Lucia, for the first time, during many years, sang to us, night after night, till the period approached for the departure of Copely and Arthur—when we all grew melancholy again—all but Archibald and Lucia, I mean. Over them, there seemed to be no influence in mortal change or circumstance. Several eminent physicians had been sent for, and their testimony was truly encouraging. `Keep their spirits up,' said they; `it is a malady of the heart, only —and they may yet be raised—even yet.' `God bless you, for it!' we all said together. `God forever bless you, for the judgment! May you hear one like to it, if ever, in sorrow and apprehension, your spirits are bowed to the dust, for some infinitely dear one, for whom you would lay down your lives!' `I shall not go with them,' said Archibald, to their questioning. `I have done my duty—I want repose. Whatever come of this, I am sick of blood-shed; and, it is time that I should begin to prepare for some change —it matters little what. I am sick of battle and strife. I want peace. Copely and Rodman have not wasted so much I—and they have more to incite them—they are married—happy—and—but so am I—happy— O, merciful heaven! happy beyond all expression—beyond all hope!—Lucia—little did I ever dream of this, love, when I thought of our earlier affection—in the solitude, the awful solitude of the camp:—when, every sound that broke upon the ear, was the tramp of a horseman, driven in by the enemy; the enemy, themselves, thundering over our entrenchments—or the trumpet breaking upon us. Would that we had met before, that—ah, brother, I envy you!—Copely, I envy you. You have that to live after you, in your sweet babes, which is worth all the pleasure of life. This boy!—(he took James up in his arms, and pronounced a benediction upon him.) `I would rather have been the father of that boy, than the founder of a kingdom— the deliverer of nations—the conqueror of all the earth. This is sovereignty—this it is, to be like a god—giving life and loveliness to creatures, that are compounded of all that you most love. If their children live, let them, I pray you, be wedded. Do not betroth them; do not restrain them, I pray you, do not; let it be remembered; and if—if I should die before them—' (I was delighted at his look; there was hope in it— and the if was a new qualification. It sounded as if he, himself, began to feel it possible to live.) `Let my property be theirs—to be equally divided.' There wanted but one week now, to a separation, that was anticipated, like death, by our poor wives. Ellen, with all her natural vivacity, was inconceivably distressed and agitated, as the time approached; and Mary turned pale, at the very mention of it, and bowed her head, like one sick at heart—sick with unutterable love and terrour, and longing. `I am determined, dear Nell,' said Copely, chucking her under the chin, one pleasant morning, just as he was about to spring into the saddle; and she stood, half pouting, half crying, to watch his departure—for an hour's ride; `to put you upon bread and water; little Luce, (the name of his babe was Lucia,) will learn nothing of your motherly, sweet qualities, except that of crying. What am I to do? Nay, Ellen—nay, my dear Ellen, do I distress you?' `Indeed you do, Chester,' she replied, putting her hands upon his shoulder, and lifting her eyes to his, while they streamed with tears; `I cannot bear this levity now. I begin to feel serious; it touches me like unkindness. I cannot bear it. I am a mother—the wife of a man—who—Chester—we have been childish; let us be so no longer. I can bear to lose you, if it must be so; to part from you again—to— no matter what — for Lucia—O she is the stay of all our womanly hearts. She has taught me many a lesson of utility. If our country must have you, I can bear it, as well as another; but do not think, O do not, Chester, that, because I laugh more; or, rather, because I have laughed more, for I have done laughing now, that I feel less. No—many a woman will laugh, to keep herself from crying. Many a time, Chester—many a time, have I rattled away, like a mad girl, before I felt the obligation of a wife and a mother; merely that I might not fall a sobbing in the deep rebuke of your seriousness. Where was your manhood? Where your steadiness? I have spoilt you; and you have left me to be taught wisdom by others? You have become a trifler—indeed you have—and I am getting a solemnity—I—' `Bless thy little heart! child!' said Chester, catching her up on his arms, and running into the house with her, and placing her upon the table, before us all. `There! stay there! by all the stars above us, Ellen Copely—wife—mother—woman—I had rather listen to thy sweet lips moving, seriously, with this plaintive musick, than to all the parsons, chaplains, and priests under heaven. Say on, dearest, say on!' Arthur ran up in the same spirit, as if to give her a hand, while we stood together, laughing at her embarrassment, and the oddity of the transformation. `Hands off! Rodman—hands off!' said Copely; `no man shall dethrone that woman, till I have done homage to her.' `O, Chester—Chester!' cried Ellen, bursting into tears, and falling upon his neck; `I cannot bear this.' `By heaven!' cried her husband, inconceivably shocked, for the first time, at her manner; `there is something that I cannot understand in this, Ellen—my own, my beloved Ellen—forgive me—how have I wounded you?' She shook her head, and blushed. `By my gaiety? Ellen— Yes, yes— ah, how little you know my heart; how liable are we to counterfeit too strongly. Ellen, I have feigned so long, and so steadily, that the feigning has become as a nature to me. I laugh now, without knowing it. When I first laughed, it made my heart ache. Do not believe that I am weaker, frailer, or less considerate, than when we married. No—I feel—thou excellent and high minded woman! a veneration for thee now—now! so beyond what I have ever felt before—that my soul stands more erect and haughty than ever. I will never trifle again.' Saying this, he kissed her affectionately—shook hands with her, vaulted into the saddle; and she left us, immediately, for her own apartment, where she shut herself up, till his return. She was strangely altered—her volatility had all gone, since the birth of her child; yet, she was not sad, nor melancholy. She was only more serious and womanly; more worthy of herself, and of her husband; while he, it was evident, had been counterfeiting a spirit, that was not natural to him, merely that she might not be intimidated, or disheartened by the approaching separation. But our hope grew stronger and brighter every hour. Archibald and Lucia were constantly together, and walking, whenever the weather would permit, for several hours at a time. Their tones were cheerful—their manner affectionate; and, we found them ever ready to enter into our thousand little plans of reform. The past was spoken of, without any dangerous emotion; the future, calmly—and there was a look of unaffected piety and submission, in the countenances of both, that comforted us exceedingly. I was now able to walk about the farm, and superintend it; while Mr. Arnauld, for the first time, since his early wound, had recovered his health, and was pursuing his plan of reformation, and benevolence, with a steadiness that delighted me. Clara was in better health, than she had ever been in her life: from a pale, sick girl, she had become a noble looking, dignified woman. Our boy was hearty as a young bear, and handsome as the dreams of painted children. There was every thing to give us hope, even in the affairs of our country; but still, for it is ever thus—there was a shadow yet, to go over the green, pleasant places of the future. The war might last, heaven only knew, how long; and Arthur and Copely were on the eve of bidding their dear ones adieu, once more—for a period, perhaps as long as before—perhaps longer—perhaps forever. What wonder that we were sad? What wonder, VOL. II 19* if their wives were forgetful of their blessings, in the terrour of this anticipation? As the hour came near, they wept, night and day, and would not be comforted. But to counterbalance this, there was a mysterious intelligence growing up, every day, between my brother and Lucia. Her hand trembled, when he took it. The blood rushed to her temples—and her look was not that of one, who believes that a chamber is preparing for her, beneath the green earth. Oh no—it was rather that of the young heart, newly awakened, from a long, dark, troubled dream; half doubtful, nevertheless, if there may not be reality in it. I watched them perpetually. My heart yearned toward them; and, while I saw a gradual and sure improvement in Lucia's health, I fancied that I could perceive a like one, in that of Archibald. Was I mistaken? follow me, my children—and the sequel will tell you. `I am thinking,' said Clara—leaning affectionately upon my shoulder, below her, with my new wooden limb over a chair; while Archibald and Lucia passed the window, locked arm in arm—their faces bright with intelligence—`I am thinking, that they are less obstinately resolved on death, than they used to be.' There was an archness in her manner, that made me smile. `Yes,' I replied—`a substantial improvement has been made by the timely admonition of your father. But for that, one or both of them might be in the grave —soon.' `But what possesses them, not to marry?' said my wife. `Have you any particular reason for asking that question, dear?' said I—observing that she coloured a little, as she did ask it. She hesitated. `Clara,' said I, gravely. `Hear me, love. Your sister has put into my keeping a secret that materially concerns her. I am not bound to keep it;—not bound I say, by any promise. I may tell you whenever I think it wise. I do not think it so, now—will that satisfy you?' `Certainly,' she replied—putting her hand upon my forehead. That is acting like a man; that is treating me like a friend. I knew that there was a secret—I have known it for a long while; nay, it is not certain that I do not know what it is; but I love to be dealt plainly with. Do you know this letter?—' (taking a letter out of her bosom.) `No,' I said— `Nor the writing?' `No—yet stay—I have somewhere seen it before— is it—it cannot surely be.' `It is Clinton's.' `And how came you by it?' `I made him give it to me,' was the reply. `Made him!—how?' I met him—coming out of Lucia's chamber. I charged him desperately; and would have wakened my father. On one condition only, did I release him; that was on his promise to leave the house immediately, without meeting her again.' `O, Clara—and did she know it?' `No—it would have broken her heart. I never alluded to it, never troubled, or watched her—I knew her too well, to doubt that some horrible villany had been practised upon her; but I knew also, whatever it was, that, if it were discovered by me, it would break her heart. I have kept the secret. She does not know that I know aught of it. I love her more than ever; wonder at her more than ever. She has not her equal among women. It is that which keeps her bruised heart unhealed; but for that, she had been well, long and long ago. Read it. There it is.' I took the letter. It ran as follows. `O, spare her—spare her, Clara, whatever become of me She is not to blame. I alone have done it. Poor Lucia—my heart bleeds for her. I am a villain. I obey—I banish myself forever. Keep the thing a secret —and—I will obey.—No, no, it was not her fault. No woman, not even Clara herself could have escaped the snare—could—' (Clara's brow contracted with haughty contempt)— `could have escaped me. She was utterly in my power, without knowing it—' CLINTON. `My excellent Clara,' I cried, embracing her. `How little have I known you! What can we do for her? Is there any thing? any thing upon this earth?' `I believe, that there is,' she replied. `They love each other. They have been open and plain in their communication. Archibald knows all;—all!—Perhaps—I speak it cautiously, perhaps we may bring about a reconciliation, that will restore her, the haughty and romantick, noble minded girl, to her own good opinion; and give to Archibald, that inconceivably lofty and wayward spirit, something to love all his life long.' `To promote that plan,' said I—giving her my hand —`which, I confess, I already begin to believe is possible I will spend my life blood.' `Pho—pho—that is too extravagant. It is so like him. However, (smiling) there will be no need of spending your life blood. A little delicacy, and patience will do it, if any thing will.' Thus was this noble minded woman, your mother, my children, perpetually unfolding some new attribute of uncommon loveliness or power, which had been, all my life long, unknown, undreamt of, by me. To her last hour, it was ever the same; the same patient endearing tenderness; the same dispassionate, calm judgment; the same beautiful transparency of heart; the same unpretending piety, and lowliness, yet firmness. O, my children, you know not your loss, nor mine—in the death of that woman! She was made for dominion over proud hearts; not for despotism, no, but for that sweet, quiet supremacy, which the soul delights to acknowledge—like the sway of a mother over her babe;— a parent over her helpless sweet child. But let me not think of her—it makes my heart swell, like a fountain, newly broken up in the desert; and I feel the tears gushing out, over the barrenness about it, with a power and prodigality that sadden me. Would that there were a garden and turf yet, for them to water and refresh! would that I might sleep now, as I did once, with the untiring watchfulness of Clara, leaning over me, like a hovering seraph, to study every emotion of my face, and interpret it to her children! You would want no other admonition. But I must be done with this theme: there is a bitterness in it, too like the foretaste of death. Come to me, Clara! come to me! I care not how soon. Let thy beckoning hand appear to me, this night—this night, dear Clara, and I will joyfully lay down my grey head, upon the wet turf, and give up the ghost, at thy bidding. But let me return. The hour of parting had arrived. It was terrible. The horses, stood saddled and caparisoned at the door; their heavy manes flashing in the wind and sun, like torn and wet banners, as they struck their iron hoofs into the green turf, and snorted to the blue skies, impatient for the sway of their riders. It is dreadful to stand by, and see, heart after heart, torn away—bleeding and desolate, at a time like this— the father from the mother—the husband from the wife —the parent from the child—yet it must be! `O, may God forever bless you, both,' said my mother, pushing back her lawn cap, and raising her wrinkled hands to the sky, while the wind blew her grey hair all over her face. `We are parting, I do fear, for the last time—the last—may God have you in his holy keeping!' `Dear Copely—dear, dear Rodman,' said Mrs. Arnauld, rushing into their arms, `I feel as if I were parting with two of my own children. The mother that bore you, boys, cannot love you better. We shall meet again—again—many times, I believe—but farewell.' `Farewell!---farewell!' said the two young soldiers, —while the entry was thronged with servants. `Remember your God,' young men, said Mr. Arnauld, impressively. `Now is the time of peril. Never unsheathe your sword, but with a belief, that you are doing his will. Farewell!' `And you, pray—will you not say, God speed, to us?' said Copely, giving a hand to my wife, and another to me, while I could scarcely support myself. `Aye, Rodman!—aye Copely—God speed you both!' said Clara, lifting her proud person to the stature of a queen. `Remember your country, first—your wife, next—and your child last. Whatever happen, we will be its parents—friends and advisers.' Their noble hearts were full—full, to bursting—and, when I fell upon their necks, and wished them—not with tears, but with a pressure, that a giant might have felt, through his armour—God speed!—they felt a confirmation of all that Clara had pronounced. `Lucia—dear Lucia,' said both of them, taking her hands, `heaven bless and restore you. Archibald, come hither—your hand.' He obyed, and gave them his hand. `Living or dead,' said Copely, with a solemnity, that shook me awfully—`living or dead, Archibald Oadley and Lucia Arnauld, God meant that you should be man and wife. Do not thwart his will.' Lucia coloured, and faltered out some inarticulate words; but, Archibald was firm and unyielding, and his forehead was serene—very. Rodman then renewed the benediction, and whispered something in her ear, glancing at his boy, whose face was near—which made her blush to the very eyes; and look, just as she used to, in the pride of her beauty. `Archibald, farewell—farewell!'—said they, both together. `My friends, I'—said Archibald, with a steady countenance, stepping out to meet them—`I—God knows if we shall ever meet again—I believe (emphatically repeating it) I believe that we shall not. Many perils beset us. I regard this as a death bed separation. No —I understand you—she is a woman of stout heart— these things do not pain her—why?—If true, they are better to be known—if false, they cannot injure us. So, let me adjure you, to be merciful. We have shed much blood—I am not at ease under it.' `Nor I,' said Copely, compressing his lips, but I would rather have an ocean of blood rolling over me, than that—that Oadley, which spun out of the brain of a scoundrel, whom I shot—I—(his voice grew deep and terrible, as it had been anciently; and his wife shut her eyes, while he spoke)—I am not easy about that—why, I know not. There is something wrong in this warfare—custom, perhaps—opinion reconciles me to it. But—' `Think seriously—prayerfully of it, my friend,' said Archibald—`and now, farewell—farewell!—one embrace, Copely; one, Rodman—and, remember that we have bled together. If you survive me, to my friends, be a friend. To your's—and your little ones — and all that love you, or are dependant upon you—if I survive you—(smiling, with a melancholy smile)—I will be all that you are.' Rodman and Copely then embraced their wives—in one long, long embrace, again—and, without turning a glance toward the rest of us—except the children, whom both kissed and blessed—leaving their manly tears upon their sweet faces—set off, at full speed, from the house. It was a bitter cold morning for the season.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XIV. “O, night and darkness, ye are wondrous strong! “Yet lovely in your strength, as is the light “Of a dark eye in woman!” —a noise among the leaves, like “twangling pearls.” It was now the middle of May; a warm sultry day, and a hot sun had gone over it, leaving a cool, shadowy greenness upon all the wood, near which we sat, about four o'clock in the afternoon, upon the shorn turf, that extended, in a pleasant slope, from the front of our dwelling, a little aslant, to a blue, beautifully blue pond and fountain, half buried in deep green transparent foliage, through which the water glittered, like a gush and sprinkle of quick-silver—while we sat there, with all that we loved upon this earth, save Copely and Rodman, about us—our children were rolling and creeping about the sward—their little fat, naked feet, ruddy with the touch of the grass—all hearts happy —all eyes, full of love and thankfulness. `That beautiful mist! Archibald,' said Lucia, lovingly, with her arm carried athwart his face, while he sat near her, with his hand resting on her soulder— `and that hollow!—how cool and pleasant it looks!' `While the sun rains fire,' answered Archibald, `upon the green topped trees behind.' `Rains fire!' said my mother, smiling—and then, with a slow, serious motion, relapsing into her occupation of knitting. `Archibald is given to such extravagancies of late,' continued Clara, touching my hand at the same time, that I might observe the vivid beauty of his deep eyes, while they dwelt upon those of Lucia, which were turned, full of devotion, and mysterious, sweet meaning, toward the wood. It was beautiful! Far away to our right, the green turf faded off to a rich, sweltering brown—and gradually subsided into a flat, yellowish soil, where a brook had once run, and left millions and millions of water worn pebbles:—over the dried bed, there still stooped a mass of the brightest green rushes;—here and there, the wild flag, spreading its broad, smooth leaf—and a rich body of sedge, with many wild, blue flowers— showing that there was a hidden moisture, yet, at the root. Still further off, there were a few pale green birches, with their silvery bark, stooping different ways, and shooting up, into the blue air, their white, slender shafts, like pillars of light; in another spot, a mass of herbage, half trodden down; a few scattered rock heaps—a lonely tree, leafed to the root; a broken stone wall; a disordered and ricketty fence; while far beyond, overgrown with ruffled foliage, and rasberry bushes, and wild cherry tree—and thorn (a very unc mmon shrub in America) ran a regular and established stone wall, at least half a century old—of the substantial New England fashion, with a line of poles all along the top—set in cross sticks—answering the various purposes of protecting the enclosure, defining the limits, and clearing the land. At the extreme left, there was a purple gleam on the dim horizon—with many little, faint spots about it—denoting that the Delaware might be seen; if we had patience to look for it. About us was a group of great venerable oaks, with two English elms. The fashion of the latter, was strangely beautiful, and picturesque: and one of the oaks had been struck with lightning some years before; half of it had been torn down, from the top to the very root; and, out of this, had gushed up innumerable branches of willow—and birch. They were now about the height of a man— VOL. II. 20 while the two parts of the torn giant, still gave out their hardy vegetation—shewing that vitality was not altogether extinct. The colour was rather of a brown and withered hue: but, over our heads, the other sister trees had intertwined their branches, with the effect of a woven, Gothic canopy—a firmament of leaves: some little art had been added to the natural inclination of the branches, when we were children: and now, there was a sheltering, chequered lattice-work above, exceedingly green and vivid—and transparent with a late shower—through which, where the sun shone, we could see every movement of every cloud in heaven, by a correspondent shadow upon the grass at our feet, as if the leaves were vitrified. And the tinting too, had became beautifully varied, as the thickness was greater or less, over us—while the multiplied shadow and light about us, were eternally shifting, with a capriciousness, that we could not have accounted for, had we been forbidden to look up, and see the interlacing branches, separate for a moment—as the matted leaves ruffled in the wind, just long enough for the light to break in—or, for us to catch a glimpse of the blue heaven over us—the fiery sun-set behind—the distant shining water—the far smoke, hovering, like in cense, in the solitude—or, the red glittering windows, at the right and left, into which the sun looked, as he went down; ruddy and beautiful—beyond the tall trees—scattering his lustre, with a greater and greater prodigality, every moment—like one, ashamed of his accumulated riches, and willing to make all the world lament his departure. `You look melancholy, dear Archibald,' said Ellenour, affectionately, putting her little girl into his lap. `There! take Lucia to your heart—and—Lord! how he blushes—little Lucia, I mean.' `Melancholy!' said Mrs. Arnauld—`ah, yes—' `I feel so,' said Archibald. `What! melancholy! Archibald?' said Lucia, her eyes full of inexpressible meaning—`melancholy, at an hour like this!' `Yes—far more so, than, in the depth and dreariness of winter, while the bleak wind pours through our dwelling, and the sky snows, day and night, upon us—but, it is a pleasant melancholy—' `You are strangely poetical of late,' said I. `I do not remember that you ever indulged yourself in such language, when you were young.' `I felt less, then, brother—inconcieveably less—the endearment of that hour, had no influence upon me; the passionate endearment of—' (he faltered.) `But why melancholy, at such an hour as this?' `The natural waywardness of the human heart,' said Mr. Arnauld. `When the sun shines, it will run into the shadow; and, when the firmament is over cast, it wishes for sunshine; men affect distinction— and, for want of that, are content with peculiarity. Power is not less conspicuous, where all is light, by its darkness, than, where all is dark, by its lightness. It is a cloud, by day; a pillar of fire, by night. You love to be apart from other men—do you not?' Archibald smiled, and shook his head. `An admirable illustration,' said he, `of that ambition—the disease of noble minds, which, in its dotage, degenerates into a love of notoriety.' `Ah!' cried Ellen, her round, sweet voice, ringing like the roundelay of some pipe, in our ear—so cheerful—so varied in all its smooth, delicate modulations, `I remember something of the sort—I have been at balls, where my heart felt heavier, than at funerals.' `Whenever there is an overacted seriousness,' said Clara, in her sensible, mild way, `it provokes us to oppose it:—and, therefore, where we are witnesses to any unmeaning, or unreasonable merriment—' `In the company of puritans, I should feel a prodigious fancy for a game of romps, I am sure,' said Ellen, interrupting her—`and, many a time, have I run away from a noisy, blinding assembly of romps, at a ball room, just to cry by myself.' `It is no less true, than strange,' said Archibald, looking Lucia in the face; `that, wherever we see any opinion, manner, or habit, pushed to extremity, we are apt, by way of shaming or rebuking it, more effectually, to run directly into the contrary extreme. Moderation, begets moderation—extravagance, extravagance—violence, violence.' `But why are you sad?—why melancholy?' repeated Mrs. Arnauld. There was a terrible, brief movement, in his thoughtful eyes, ere he replied; and, when he did reply, it was with the air of one that feels much, very much, but would not have it known—one that would convey deep counsel in a light way—fluid gold in a wooden cup—mystery and power—in the language of common conversation—from what motive?—that it might be chosen, or not; followed, or not; taken, or rejected, without the cold formality of advice, or preparation. `I am melancholy, my dear madam, whenever I see the sky of that colour; because, it reminds me of the day, that I first did battle on. I am melancholy, whenever I feel the warm summer air blowing in my face, and stirring the thin hair upon my forehead; for, it reminds me that—(putting his hand upon Lucia) — that—in the morning of my day, she would sometimes, at an hour like this, stir it with her breath. I—pardon me Lucia—I am melancholy, madam, because I have feelings here---here—that nobody will understand; because, I am not believed; because— In short, tears have fallen upon my forehead; and, I am unhappy, when the rain---(wiping some drops from his face, at the moment, as they fell through the washed leaves)---reminds me of them— mother, I would rather die with blood upon my hands, than the tears of a broken hearted woman.' `What book is that?' said Mrs. Arnauld, abruptly, in the pause that followed, as if anxious to turn our thought into another channel. `The Vicar of Wakefield,' said Mary, putting her white hand upon it. `By whom?' `By one Goldsmith,' said I---`Oliver, I believe.' `The poet?' said Archibald. `He wrote some verses once, called—I forget the name.' `The Traveller; or, The Deserted Village?' said Lucia. `Yes,' said Mrs. Arnauld---`and what think you of it, Mary?' `You know, my dear madam, that I am not well qualified to judge; but I think it very beautiful, and very natural---the book, I mean---I have never read the poem.' `I am glad to hear you say so,' said Mr. Arnauld--- `it is the best novel that ever was written.' `Novel, pa,' said Lucia, `what is a novel?' `Any tale, my child, like the parables of our Saviour ---the fables of men---any invention, of prose or verse ---though we call the latter a poem. This work is, of the class to which it belongs---the most perfect novel, that ever was written. It is worth all his other writings---all his poems---all his essays---his Citizen of the World, into the bargain.' `Do you include dramas, father?' said Lucia, turning about, so that the rich shadow of the setting sun shone on her, like the lustre of a dimmed furnace, making a picture so beautiful and eloquent, that her father locked his hands, and called upon us, by a motion of his eyes, to look at it, before it vanished. `No, my child,' said he, `dramas are a species of novel writing---so indeed are all compositions, where imaginary creatures, invested with all the attributes of humanity, agitated by the passions of our nature, are put to the task of entertaining or terrifying us.' `I have thought,' said Archibald, `that novel writing has been shamefully mistaken.' `And abused, and degraded,' said Mr. Arnauld, impressively. `We have the highest authority for novel writing. To write a good novel, a man should be a poet, a dramatist, a painter, a tragick and comick writer, a philosopher, a preacher, and an orator. He should be able to pourtray intellectual and invisible things, as vividly, as the substantial landscapes and VOL. II. 20* countenances of the earth. Men of talents have abandoned novel writing to women and children; and they, after beginning their career with a novel, disdain to continue, but soar, as they imagine, higher, by dabbling in poetry or the drama. No! my notion is, that it requires greater talent to write a great novel, than to write an epick poem, a tragedy or a comedy—many a sermon, and many an oration.' `And then the influence of novel writing—there is Richardson—and—' `The influence, of which you speak, is greater than that of all other literature. People read novels, who never go to play or to church. People read novels, who never read plays, sermons, history, philosophy, nor indeed any thing else: And people read novels secretly, in all weathers, from morning till night—who do nothing else. How material then is it, that their power should be understood; their eliment purified; the conduits, by which we receive this intoxicating aliment, under the superintendence of people, that know the consequence of drugging the human heart, to delirium, with poison and death, in the shape of exhilaration.' `Ah—that shadow! look Archibald—look!' said Ellen.' It was the shadow of many birds, passing swiftly at the time; and the water below us—nay, the very turf appeared to move, for a moment, under our eyes. A shot rang just behind the trees, where we sat, and the next moment, down came two or three wild birds, fluttering through the blue air, almost at our feet. They were followed by a troop of boys, who ran off with them, pursued by him that had shot at the birds. `Oo nat les buissons, et 'es autres prennent les oiseaux,' said Mrs. Arnauld, smiling, while Mr. Arnauld, throwing a pleasant eye at his wife, observed. `You have really a wonderful memory, my dear; nay, I don't wonder that you laugh; that formed the motto to the ring, that I gave you, after I came from Italy. You have applied it adroitly enough.' `No—I beg your pardon: that was Italian—a—uno —what was it, Lucia?' `Indeed, my dear mother, I do not recollect it; what was the sentiment?' `The sentiment! O, it was a hit at me, for my coquetry; he had been beating the bush.' `There is an Italian proverb,' said Lucia—`perhaps that is it. Uno leva la lepre; e, un altro la piglia.' `Oui ma chere,' said the mother, bridling, with an innocent affectation, that half displeased Arnauld; while Clara dropped her head, and began pulling flowers for her boy. `Wee m'a chare,' said my mother, to herself, but just loud enough to be heard; `wee—march—air—beautiful!— wee march hair—beautiful!' I began to pull flowers too. `See! see!' cried the delighted Ellen. I turned my face, and saw the two children, each with both hands full of flowers—crushed in the pressure; the little girl stopped, and, holding up her hand, to take what the boy was offering her, let her own drop; all about them, the earth was like trodden velvet. `The dog and the shadow!' said Clara, smiling; `how natural and innocent is such avidity. See the dear creatures!' `I remember once,' said Archibald, `seeing a beautiful picture, which represented a mother and her babe. The story was this: that child's handful of flowers, held so differently from our manner of holding them— reminds me of it. The child had crept to the brink of a precipice, before the mother had missed it: when she turned her face, she discovered her babe upon the very verge. God touched her heart—she tore away the covering from her bosom; and the little nestling turned, saw the place of beauty, and remained immoveable, till she had crept near enough to catch him, and faint.' The painter ought to have seen these children. I am no painter; but, beautiful as that picture was, it troubled me. The child sat upon the verge of the precipice—leaning back, at the sight of his mother, and, offering a handful of the plucked flowers. This was wrong. I felt it then; but, then I did not know, as I now do, why it was wrong. That child held the flowers, just as a grown person would, by the stems; but these children do not. No children, so young, would ever. Why? Because they catch at that part which attracts their eye: the light of a candle—the coloured leaf, or the blossom. It is the flower, that they seize and tear up. Of course, the flowers should be seen only, crushed and broken, in the hand; and, at the sides, or through their fat fingers, where they parted. Another fault.— `I remember that picture,' said Clara; `I have seen it—but proceed.' `Another fault,' continued he, `is this: the child is sitting upon the precipice. That was wrong. When the child had gone so far, as to sit upon it, and let its little feet hang over, the danger was already past; the extreme danger I mean. The peril is not half so great to the child, while it is looking over the precipice, as, at the moment, when it is beginning to sit down, as children always do sit—by turning backward to the object, and rolling over. Nay, a man that could stand forever there, could not sit down. Now, my notion is, that the child should not be sitting, but creeping; nay. I would have it so, that the spectator should start, and hold his breath, and put out his hands to save it, if he came suddenly into the room, where the picture was.' `Ah!' said Ellen, smiling; `and wouldn't you have the cry of the mother painted too? so that he should hear that?' `You know,' said Archibald, tapping her hand, as it lay upon the grass near him, while she kept pulling back her little girl, like a truant robin, at every moment or two, and then letting her creep away: `you know that, if we see a man falling, our horrour is inconceivably greater, if his head be downward; or, if he be likely to fall upon his head. So in a picture. If we see a real child, about to fall upon its feet, we should feel much less of that desperate convulsion of the heart, which would happen to us, if we saw the picture of one, falling on its head. I would suppose then, that the child has crept to the precipice, step after step, in gathering, flower after flower: I would suppose that one hand was resting, with all the weight of its blessed little body, upon the loosened turf, which, I would paint so that it should appear falling and detaching itself, under the pressure; nay, I would represent the loose earth yielding below: I would show that other pieces had fallen—clod after clod—from the overhanging flowery, unsupported brink—and this I would show, by the roots, and withered grass, and fibres straining and clinging together yet, and hanging down; nay, I would have some earth dropping, if it might be; and the calm deep water below—broken like a mirrour, by the falling gravel or dirt. You shudder! I am glad of it: the picture would make your blood run cold. I would have the mother appear just at this moment—not standing upright, but almost upon her hands and knees, almost creeping, through the near hedge, beneath which he had crept; her bosom should be swelling, on a line nearly level with the child's eye. I would have her nearness and expression so great, that you would exclaim, on seeing her—wait one moment—only one moment! and her hand will be upon his! and then, we should all know, from the motion of her body—the paleness of her lip—that she would drop dead upon the spot —yet clinging to her boy—nevertheless. Ah! see that hand! there I would have the crushed flowers dropping loosely from his little hand, just as it is from that child's now, while it is outstretched to you.' Just then, the wind began to rise, pleasantly stirring the branches over our green seat; and sprinkling us with a few water drops. `Let us go in,' said Mrs. Arnauld; `the sky is overcast, and there is a particular blackness at the west.' `O, no, no! mother,' said Lucia; `let us remain. It is the breath of God. I feel it, like returning life in all my dilated heart---I—' `There will be no rain, I believe,' said Mr. Arnauld interrupting her, and looking upward, while his hat blew off and rolled away, to the delight of the little children, as it passed them---`but the wind is rising as I never saw it before: and the clouds are gathering athwart the sky---gracious God!—' A thunder clap broke over us, at that moment, with a rush of lightning so voluminous, and so tremendously bright—like ten thousand rockets, that, for a moment I believed that we were all struck blind.—When I came fully to the possession of myself, I saw the further elm tree blazing in the wind—fifty yards higher than its top; and all our little family lying about— under a shower of rain, which, as it struck the low roof of one of the outer buildings, just below us—broke over it, like a cascade of fire. I never saw such a tremendous rush of water from the skies. The dried brook was like a mill race, before I had sense enough to hobble round among our sweet scattered family, all of whom, blessed be God! were unharmed, though the lightning had broken about us, and above us, like a volley of musquetry. We were soon in the house; but, only in time, to see the passing of a whirlwind, that, the old men of the country will turn pale now, at the mention of. Lord! how it thundered!—It came onward, like a vast black column, with a blood coloured brightness resolving in its centre, and the point advanced.—In a moment, we saw the sky all black with the branches of trees—torn fences; shattered frame houses; and every species of rubbish, which clattered and shivered and broke, with one incessant revolution for a minute, over our head. A fearful concussion in the heavens—a crash—followed—and all was silent. It was some minutes before we dared to look into each others faces, amid the silent and awful darkness that followed; fearing, I know not what; to me, it was like the last day; and when Clara put her babe into my arms; and, dropped, kneeling, at my feet; it was with the look of a mother, who sees the heavens passing away, and the stars dropping, one after the other, into the ocean. The rain fell upon us—and the wind blew through and through our apartment. We lifted up our eyes. The windows were stove in; three, out of four chimneys, were blown down; a part of the roof swept off; and the very earth, where we lately sat, was torn up, as by the hoofs of innumerable horses.—Yet—O, yet—not a living soul had been harmed, and when Mr. Arnauld called over our names, in the darkness, with a convulsive emotion—servants and all—not one of the whole family failed to answer `here am I.'—no, not one. Righteous heaven!—how wonderful and mysterious are the sources of our consolation. At another hour, the least of these many calamities had made us repine; but now, in the shipwreck of our dwelling; the destruction, probably, of all our hope for the season, there was not one heart among us, that did not beat loudly in thanksgiving. Nay, in four hours from the time of the devastation—a devastation, which has never been forgotten in that part of the country—we were reassembled in one of the large, neglected apartments of the mansion—happier by far, than we had been the night before, with a strong roof over our heads, and a clear summer sky shining in at the windows. `Let a man go with me,' said Archibald, with a depth and sincerity, that I shall never forget—`out into the wilderness, on such a night as this—sit with me, as we sat together this afternoon, before the hurricane broke down upon us; and feel the soft air whispering about his heart; or hear the thunder breaking at his feet; and see the great trees bending and parting, in the wind and blackness of God's power— I care not who he is, or what he is—where born—or how educated—I defy him to stand upright!—I defy him not to fall down, with his forehead in the dust, and acknowledge the presence of a God.' `Yet, Archibald,' said I—`you stood upright'— `Did I?'— `Yes,' I repeated—`and Lucia too, stood upright, while her hair blew about like the torn flush foliage of yon honeysuckle.' `I did not know it,' said Lucia—`but I remember that Archibald did; and I clung to him—for he saw something.' `Saw something! what did you see?' said my mother—who had a terrible notion of portents and prodigies; and battles in the heaven; for, when she was young, (she was a native of Connecticut) she had been awakened out of her sleep, by a sudden red light in the sky; the heavens were all on fire—probably by some passing meteor; and when others told her that armies were seen that night, and chariots and horsemen—with the noise of artillery; and, that the smoke rolled down upon the earth, like a heavy fog; she listened to it so long—that, at last, she began to confound what others said, with what she had seen; and before her death, did religiously believe, that she had heard drums and trumpets on that night—and seen a battle above the stars.—`What did you see, Archibald?' said she, pressing close to him. `God and his angels out upon the wind! the sky smoking under his chariot wheels! while they rained fire upon us'—said Archibald. `Heavens! Archibald!' said Lucia, stepping up to him, and putting her hand upon his forehead—`what ails you! you were not looking up, when I saw you— your eyes were upon the ground—what did you see?' `Clinton! I saw Clinton there.' She fell upon his neck. `George Clinton! his white bosom naked; the hilt of my sword pressing into it; the blood—blood!— as plain as when he lived, trickling, drop by drop— O, God!--down over his side; his hands thrust into his own hair, with the suddenness of instant and violent death.—O, Lucia, Lucia!—no wonder that I heard the chariot wheels of God; the trumpeting of archangels. The sweat started out of me, from head to foot; and, the turf, it appeard to me, as I bore thee over it—wherever I set my foot, gushed out with fire, and, smoke and, I walked over broken sword blades, human faces, and the manes of dead horses.' `You are mightily disordered, my dear Archibald,' said Lucia, affectionately pushing aside the wild brown hair, that shadowed his white brow—`I have never heard you talk so strangely; how wild you look!— Did the lightning strike you?' `Strike me---feel here---here, Lucia. It is dust--- dust and ashes. Strike me!---it rushed through and through me---I---O, I am very faint---very.' He grew deadly pale, and his head sunk upon her shoulder, as he finished. As for us, we were altogether unable to reason or think steadily, for a moment. There was a preternatural vividness in our recollection of the last few hours; and a dim, shadowy---impenetrable indistinctness, of those, of all our lives before. For myself, I am willing to declare, that I could not have answered the simplest question, till after I had slept that night; and that all the feelings of my heart seemed crushed and stupified, except the love of my boy and wife. Even my mother was forgotten, in the terrour and darkness of our disorder. Was it the effect of the lightning? I know not; but, I know this---that the clap was ringing in my ears, for a week after, with a noise that kept me from sleeping or thinking; and that the discharge of lightning, was incessant---and blinding---painfully so, even to my shut and bandaged eyes—long afterward. But Archibald was soon more calm;---and toward morning, after we had sent out, as far as we could, to inquire into the situation of our neighbours, which was deplorable indeed, where they lived in frame houses; and to offer them an asylum, such as we had left, in ours---we all withdrew to our rooms; but not to sleep. Neither Clara nor I, could sleep; and I felt her tears VOL. II. 21 trickling, all the night long, down my neck, as her dear head lay upon my arm, while our little boy nestled at her bosom, and slept so quietly, that---O! it was a comfort to feel him stir sometimes, to assure us that he was a living child, and that his sleep was not the sleep of death. There was a strange brightness in the west, all the night long; and, through our windows, which were almost the only ones in the house, which had not been broken in, sashes and all, by the hurricane, there was a constant glimmering upon the wall, that troubled me more than I was willing to confess. The night appeared immeasurably long—I thought that the morning would never arrive: nay, I began to have strange fancies; and to doubt if—in truth, the sky might not have been torn away by the tempest. `Would that the day would break!' said Clara, in a low whisper, as if to see if I were asleep. `It is breaking, dear,' said I—`look there.' `Do I tire your arm,' said she, gently raising her head. `No indeed, dear, I moved it, unconscious of the weight upon it, to point to the east, where that luminous, incessant surging of light appears—like a sea breaking over its barriers.' `That is no day break, my husband,' said she, holding her breath, and drawing near to me. `It has been a terrible night—a very long one—I---pray look at your watch. It appears to me, many hours beyond the time of day light.' I affected to laugh; but I cannot deny that my heart quaked, with an awful feeling, as I pulled out my watch. You cannot readily understand me, my children. It is impossible that you should. You have never passed such a night. I hope that you never may. But you will believe that my terrour was not of a light nature, when I tell you that—I have seen some terrible things, at night—my father's dwelling in flames; thronging with banditti and murderers:—that I have done battle in the night, with twenty cannon splitting in my ears; and the ground covered with dead and dying men: yet, never—never! in all my life, have I endured a sensation of such intolerable weight, and coldness, and horrour, as when I plucked out my watch, and held it up to the light. As I am a living man, children, had the last day been at hand, in reality—and, I had seen the skies rushing away, in silence; and I had been suddenly forgiven, I could not have felt a more terrible convulsion of joy, than when I saw the watch hand pointing at three o'clock—instead of six or seven—and heard it, as I put it to my ear, clicking with life. My hand shook; and, I was not aware of my condition, till Clara exclaimed— `As I live, John, you are crying!—what disturbs you so mightily?' I could not reply. I was ashamed to own the true cause—but I embraced her, as I would, had we been plucked out of the water: We only, from the population of a world, at the deluge—or, been sent away, rejoicing, at the last day. Our silence continued, until the breathing of our dear boy called our attention to him. `How untroubled the sleep of that child,' said she. `Thus will it be forever, that the wise and powerful are disquieted, in exact proportion to their wisdom and power.' `It was a tremendous visitation!' said Clara, fervently pressing her lips to my cheek. `Did you see how Archibald bore it?' `That did I! He stood up like a creature of the elements, unawed and undisturbed. I was amazed at his calmness.' `And I—I was terrified.' `Terrified!—why?' `It was unnatural. Husband, there is something in his manner of late, that will not let me sleep. Do you not observe it?' `I observe that he is exceedingly devout—that he is forever with Lucia—and that the sweet wisdom of her beautiful mouth is beginning to work its way into his heart.' `I am not satisfied with it,' said she. `While they are most deeply engaged in conversation, there are fits of musing that come over him, as if he were holding communion with some invisible being—and, then he walks in his sleep.' `Yes—at times, I know that he does. But that is on account of Clinton. He has never slept quietly since. He never will. The night sweat is upon him —and, I have heard him sob, in his dreaming, as if some strong hand were pressing his great heart to suffocation. But I have observed a change in Lucia, that delights me. She is altogether better, happier, and less abstracted in her look. She talks no more of dying.' `Nor Archibald,' said Clara, in a tone that startled me. `He talks no longer of it. They are strange people.' `They are, indeed,' said I. `I know not what they contemplate; but a complaint like theirs, I think, may always be brought on, by deep thought; and unsparing, uninterrupted, long continued trouble and sorrow, are often attended with a melancholy, intemperate enthusiasm, which terrifies by its sublimity, while it awes by the serenity, and sweetness, and tenderness of its approach. Nor am I satisfied. What should be done?' `I have thought—' said Clara, hesitatingly. `You know Lucia's pride—having prepared so steadily for death—honestly, I am sure—she would not consent to live—she would be ashamed to live, now, lest all her declarations should be considered as a piece of cunning. We have a delicate part to act. But, my opinion is clear. I would have them marry.' `Marry!' said I; surprised, indeed, at the suddenness of the proposition. `Would it be possible?' `Yes. I will answer for Lucia. Better health, better spirits have given her better views of happiness. But, the proposition must come frankly, without any appearance of stratagem, or intrigue, from Archibald. It may save both of their lives.' `You astonish me,' I replied. `I have never thought of this. I have suffered myself to believe that both would live: nay, that both were fond of each other; for, their growing tenderness and veneration have been evident to me—but so long a time has passed —so many years, that—' `It matters not,' said Clara. `I believe that it is not too late—will you promote it?' `With all my heart,' said I; `but how?' `There is only one way. Archibald would have married her, notwithstanding all that had happened, the extent of which, it is probable—nay, it is certain, that he knows, though I do not—long ago; but a certain high, noble principle of honour, arising from a belief that he should soon leave her a widow, prevented him from making the offer. He believes that he will die yet—and, before many months. It is a childish notion—the consequence of disappointed affliction— weakness of heart—and protracted decay.' `You are right, dear Clara—I have no doubt that Archibald might live many years: nay, go into battle again, with reputation and strength—if—he could be persuaded to forget the thought of death—to overlook his own reiterated prediction. The fact is, that people, who have been a long time preparing for another world—like them that are about to set out on a long journey—are impatient for their departure, after they have made up their minds, and exhausted our sympathy, and found us, in a measure, reconciled to the separation. They are sorry to go—but dare not acknowledge it—willing to remain, but ashamed to say so.' `My notion is—ah, the little wretch!—how he bites!' Master Jemmy had just discovered that the fountain of her beauty was near to him—and he was puffing away at it---hands and feet, like a fine fellow—when I arose, and looked upon him, leaning over the mother VOL. II. 21* and child, with a feeling such as a father and husband only, can experience. It was time to get up. The blue east was breaking into an ocean of tumultuous loveliness, the light; here and there, issuing through the clouds, like dammed-up waters forcing their way into the world. It was cold, all very cold, but preternaturally beautiful and flashing. `Good morrow, love!' said I—kissing her chaste forehead, as I was about to leave the room—after standing over her for some minutes, while her fringed lids, half shut over the dear babe that lay, cuddled all up in a heap, under her snow white arm—and her red lip were full of maternal endearment—`Good morrow!'— `Good morrow,' she murmured inaudibly—pressing the boy more closely to her heart, and half opening her sweet eyes—for a moment; and then, while her voice died away in a faint breathing, like a low summer wind among hawthorn flowers—dropping her head down upon his ruddy forehead.—I could have fallen upon the bed and wept with delight, at the picture before me—a mother and her babe! so young, so beautiful—so innocent;—her white bosom heaving with love; and her gentle arm intertwined about my offspring, as if it were her own heart that had crept out into the air for a moment, and lay under her soft hand.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XV. `Who made me brotherless? `His eyes are open;—then he is not dead! `Death is like sleep; and sleep shuts down our lids; `His lips too, are apart; why, then, he breathes! `And yet I feel it not.—His heart!—his heart.' Cain. `The earth swims round me!—what is this?—'tis wet;— `And yet there are no dews—'Tis blood!—' Ibid. My heart fails me. I never shall be able to carry you through the whole war, as I intended to do, when I began. It is out of the question. My own return to the army; the desolation that fell upon us; the darkness—the—no, I cannot.—I will content myself then, with relating one or two more incidents, which happened soon after the conversation that I related in my last, as calmly as I can—enjoining you, first, that you religiously observe my instructions at the beginning; and keep each package separate. Let them be marked as letters, one, two, three, &amp;c.—just as I have sent them. I have good reason for what I have done. They are usually about five sheets, each, being a quantity which I have calculated would be about sufficient for an evening. Intelligence from the south—no—I will have done with the war. The story of my brother, and the extraordinary woman, to whom he attached himself, has taken such possession of me, that I can see nothing, hear nothing, think of nothing, but him and her. The war, and the men of the revolution; my own sufferings, and those of my family; the army—my country; all are forgotten, or remembered, as a matter subordinate to the sorrow, of Archibald and Lucia. It is in vain that I would try to keep my attention any longer upon the object that I set out with—the war. I cannot. I can only remember Archibald, as he stood before me at his marriage, so spiritualized with beauty and expression. But have patience with me. It is a disorderly story at best; but it must be told in my own way. Not long after the storm, we were surprised by the sudden appearance of young Nick. `Halloo, Nell,' said he, capering into the room, like a wild beast, learning to dance upon a heated earthen floor—`halloo!—dad has gone!' `Gone! where?' said Ellenour— He stopped—a dark, turbid expression hurried over his forehead—and his eyes filled.—`There! there!' pointing downward. Ellen turned pale.—`Father—poor father—is he dead?' `Dead! dead!' repeated the dwarf—kissing her— `but, don't cry Nell; don't cry—he was sensible at the last, and willing to die—and—bless your heart, Nell—don't take on so—He died, poor old father, in his christian senses.' I was inconceivably shocked at his manner; it was so unnatural and violent, and contradictory; yet, there were tears in the creature's eyes; and, his ugly knees knocked together, when he saw Ellen drop into a chair. `Sister, look you. I have no great reason to blubber about the old man. You know that all my life long, I have been kicked and cuffed about by the whole family—I----' She lifted her face, covered with tears—`except by you, dear Nell,' he said, feelingly, `buffetted, and shamed, and spit upon; and why? ask that kind gentleman there—and that—and that—and any woman here; is it that I have wronged 'em? no—is it that I am devilish? who made me so? where is there a temper so sweet and forgiving, that no outrage, no mockery— none!—though continued, year after year, will turn it to bitterness; where—where—(I thought that he was choaking)—I had hoped—not to be loved—but pitied—whose blood would not be turned to fire? Look at me. I am ugly. I confess it—I am sorry for it. My limbs are jointed and knotted, like the twisted oak—my features are savage and threatening---my nostrils like the race horse---raw, and red---and broad. It is a sign of vigour. Could you see no beauty in them? Pardon me, forgive me; nay, love me, Ellen; for, I love you better than father did. Do not curse me, that I rejoiced at his death. He was a benevolent man to all the world but me; kind, to all but me; compassionate, and forbearing, to all but his own offspring, the first of his own loins, and why?—because, unhappily---God had seen fit to shape me, not according to his own image. See there?—there is a woman whom I saved from death---death!—no from what was ten thousand times worse than death; yet, she shudders at my voice. I shot a man in the saddle, to whose waist she was buckled; covered myself with human blood to save her; battled, in smoke and flame, for her and hears; brought about a reconciliation between her and her lover, who thought her dead---- yet she turns pale at my red fiery eyes; and the other loathes, and curses me, for a brute—who would not be tired of well doing?' I was amazed! I went up to him and scrutinized him; and Mary wept aloud upon his hands, when he offer ed them to her; while Ellen nearly repeated to me, in the same voice, what she had said years before—when my eyes were upon him, in the very same room, and almost in the very same spot. `You are mistaken!' Here Archibald entered, and prayed me to go with him on a walk. His manner was very serious, and somewhat melancholy; while his voice was rather more cheerful than usual. `And whither would you go?' said I. `Some miles,' he replied. `Well done! my brother; I am glad of this!' said Clara. `This will do—there is heart for all of us, in a walk of miles.' `And why not ride?' said I. `For several reasons,' he replied, with increasing solemnity; `our horses could not go, where I want to go. And—' `No matter for the rest,' said I, sportively; `but, as well as a wooden leg will permit, I am your companion, if you believe that I can go, where a four footed beast cannot. Are you ready?' `Yes.' `When shall we expect you back?' said Mrs. Arnauld, while Lucia opened her lips, meekly, as awaiting the answer. `Not for some days!' said he. `Not for some days! what is the meaning of this?' I asked. `I cannot well explain all my reasons here,' he said, glancing at the family; `but, go with me, and you shall know them all before sunset.' The thought flashed over me all at once, that he had heard some intimation of our design respecting Lucia; and I prepared to follow him with uncommon alacrity. We departed immediately, and had walked two hours, with a great shepherd's dog at our heels, without having spoken a dozen words—when he stopped suddenly, under a large spreading walnut-tree, in the centre of a wide enclosure. `Do you recollect this place, brother?' said he, pointing to the right, with his arm extended. I paused a moment. There was something familiar to my recollection, in the appearance of the spot; but I had never approached it, in this direction before; and I knew not where we were. `No,' said I. `It was there that I spilt the blood of a human being, for the first time,' he replied, in a low tone. I shuddered at the sound of his voice. `No—that is further to the right; a full mile from here?' said I. `You are mistaken. Here, I shot a man; here, where I now stand—long and long, before you had any idea of my familiarity with death: here, I saw the brains oozing out of his temples; saw him writhe and pluck up the grass with his red hands, and foam at the mouth, while his nostrils swam in blood. Do you see that green hillock there?' `Yes.' `There he lies buried. I dug his grave with my own hands. I buried him. It was at the full of the moon—very cold—very; yet the sweat stood like rain upon my forehead, when it was over.' I looked at him in astonishment—was he disordered? He was very calm. But madmen have been often calm. `You are mistaken,' I replied, again; `when the man fell, I did not know that you shot him. I was just in sight.' `You mean the trooper, brother. It was not the first blood that I had spilt.' `I do not understand you,' said I. `Let us be gone.' `Can you lift that flat rock there?' `Yes.' `Heave it then: let me see you.' I attempted it; and, after a violent exertion, abandoned it as impracticable. `I am weaker than you, John,' said Archibald, mournfully; `yet, on the night that I did this, I heaved that rock from its place, and leaned it against the tree, just where you see the bark scarred and bruised there —and—come, let us try it together.' `For what purpose?' said I, getting impatient at such solemn trifling. `You shall see,' he replied, stooping and placing his hands under it. `Lift with me, brother, and you will see. Now! now!—heave!' We turned up the rock, and the first things that I saw, were a pair of rusty pistols, and a piece of white cloth, mildewed—partially decayed, and spotted all over with what looked, even then, of a crimson hue. I staggered to the tree; and Archibald stooped, as if to touch it; but he could not. His arm shook, and he withdrew his hand, and looked about, in every direction, for a moment—then folded his arms, and the following dialogue passed between us. `Did you never wonder at my desolate aspect, when a boy?' `Never—after that summer, when you came home one morning delirious, without hat or shoes.' `Do you remember when that was?' `Yes—pretty well. You were eighteen just afterward. Lucia Arnauld had just began to be shy of you.' `Right. Do you remember the sudden disappearance of young Hardy?' I started. A strange, terrible light broke in upon me. I gasped for breath. I was unable to reply. `There sleeps Hardy,' he continued, pointing to his grave; `there lie his pistols: that one—I remember it well, (setting his foot upon one, from the muzzle of which a broken and bent rammer projected some inches,) that is the one that killed him.' `And whose was the hand?' `Mine!' said Archibald. `Your's! your's Archibald! Oh, merciful heaven! Your's! Archibald Oadley a murderer!' `Yes—a murderer.' I wept aloud. I would have denied the avowal— called the man accursed, forever, who had dared to whisper such a charge against him; yet there were the proof—the proof! who could resist it! Besides, Hardy had disappeared the night before his intended departure for the army—and—yes, it was too plain! Archibald had murdered the poor fellow; while we believed that he had joined the army, and fallen in some of our early battles. This accounted for Archibald's sudden change of temper; his melancholy; his awful steadiness in battle. Yes! I wept aloud. `Unhappy man!' said I—shuddering from head to foot, as I looked him in the face—while his large eyes shot fire upon me: `let us be gone. I—even I, your own brother, do not feel safe with you. Replace the accursed stone—bury the instruments of death; and let us depart.' `With all my heart,' said he, replacing the stone, with a kick. `There! it is done. Men have said that it is not possible to hide blood. See! we have found it easier to hide than to reveal it. There! the deed is hidden. Now hear me. I slew Hardy. His blood is upon my hands; yet it should be upon his own head. You have never asked me how it was.' `I could not—I dared not. I had not the heart to ask you.' `Yet hear me. He fell a sacrifice to his own folly and madness. I was thunderstruck at my own guilt. He was dead before I knew it; nay, before I meant it. We were shooting at a mark—we quarrelled—and he struck me. I had heard of duels; but I knew nothing of how they were to be conducted. It was late in the afternoon. He was a soldier; about to join the army; and his air of superiority had chafed me a long while. I fell upon him and beat him—for I would never take a blow, as you can witness, from mortal man. He challenged me, as we lay bleeding upon that little swell there; no, not that—he is buried there; but further to the left—I scorned him for the thing. I did not believe that he was in earnest. But he called me a coward—a coward!—I knew not what the word meant. My reading had never brought me acquainted with it; yet his manner of uttering the word convinced me that it was something, for which I ought never to forgive him. I would have fallen upon him again;—but he presented his pistol. I advanced—he threatened. I took up mine, just in time to hear Lucia Arnauld's name—pronounced—(strange, that two men have died blaspheming that woman!) and a bullet whistled VOL. II. 22 through my hair. I returned the shot—for we were very near—and the smoke and flash of his pistol nearly blinded me—and I was still nearer, when I fired.' `He fell. I cannot tell you what else happened—I was stupified—blind—and suffocated with horrour. It appeared to me that many days and nights passed, before I left the spot. I saw him roll upon the green sward. I saw the grass glitter, as it arose from the pressure of his head; and shake itself, as if the dew of blood upon it, were hateful and scorching as fire. I buried him—how, I know not—but I did bury him, in the awful solitude of midnight—ten thousand sweet stars looking down upon me; and the blue windows above, all crowded with faces that wept upon me. I buried the pistols there, and the handkerchief—and went home. From that hour to this, I have never looked into this enclosure. Even at noon day—even now—in your company, I feel that it is haunted; and can almost see Hardy, at my feet—do not step back— why do you?—he is not there.' `Your looks, brother; I am terrified at your looks. Let us go.' `Aye, let us go. I have seen it for the last time. I can describe it now, when the angel of the Lord shall read over my sentence hereafter—but I have wrestled with angels, all my life long.' There was something inconceivably terrifick in the deep calm of his look, as he said this. `I pity you —from my soul I do, brother;' said I. `You are not the guilty creature, that I feared—I wonder now, that I ever doubted you.' `Infatuated man! Is my guilt the less, that I slew a human creature here, in a passion, than if I had crept upon him, cooly, and slain him—deliberately?—Let us go.' `Whither?' `Follow me.' `But whither?' `To another place.' (I shuddered.) `More blood?' said I. `Yes.' `I will not go another step.' `Then stay. But no—come, come—it is none secretly shed. I have no untold blood, now, upon my soul.' `But why not tell of it?' said I. `Why not relate the truth?' `Why!—in a place, where a death by accident, from one so young as I, would have turned every heart in the country against me, as a monster. No---I saw that no stir was made about it---and I determined not to tell. Why should I? He was to go away the next day; and his careless, forgetful temper accounted for his disappearance. He came suddenly among us; and on foot. Why should he not go in the same manner? Nay, when I knew that he had run away from his father, to join the army, I felt safe. It stopped all enquiry: the times were troubled; and all strange and bloody affairs were attributed to the British or tories.' `At first,' he resumed, after a long and distressing pause—`at first, it was my intention to relate the affair, honestly, just as it had happened---but, my confidence in the charity of men, diminished every hour--- and my terrour of their evil judgment, which haunted me day and night, with a continually augmenting force, grew, at last, into an unsupportable weight. I should have gone mad, I verily believe, in the dark trouble that was upon me, had not I seen other hands, other lips, innocent as mine had been; even your's, John, died in human blood. I arose then, and shook off the hot fetters that bound me---they fell from me, like an iron rain, while my spirit burnt out, in the battle, like a furnace---and—' I could hear no more. He continued talking, and I stood and listened to him, with an indescribable awe: but I heard him not; nor did I understand him. He stood loftily before me, dilating, in the sunshine, to an unearthly stature, and his voice was like that of one who has come up from the place of death. It was very terrible and continued—incessant; and smote upon my heart, like a cold rain: but I remember nothing of what he said—till we had arrived at another spot; where he stood, and stretched out his arms with a solemnity that kept me breathless. `Here!' he cried—`here it was, that my foot was first set in the stirrup, for battle! Here! under the cold moonlight, while the very snow darkened under our swift shadows, did we ride together, for the first time! our articulate pulses, throbbing fiercely with the first stirring of battle! Here—even here, while the dwelling of our father was fired—and the red flame rushing upward, with the shriek of women, and the shouting of death—here rode we, in the moonlight, carelessly reining our horses, in the brief, boyish tumult of parade! O, how little we knew of the serious business of war? how little of what was going forward, at the same moment, within a few miles of us!' O my children!—I have seen man fearfully agitated. I have heard him laugh, like a devil, in the smoke and flame of battle. I have seen men slaughtered and dying, with their hearts crushed out—the wild beast looking from his dark retreat, through the red mist, that rose in the starlight, from the place of slaughter. I have seen—O, many a terrible sight!—but nothing in all my life, so preternatural and overpowering, as the look of Archibald's eyes; while he stood, with his pale hands outstretched toward the green, distant earth, moving them, as if there were shadows visible to him, and to him, alone, and obedient to his motion—the shadows, it may be, of man and horse—foot and horsemen—that had died, under his eyes, since they last rode together within this very enclosure. I could not have borne it longer. It was like a great spell upon me —pinioning me down—hand and foot—lungs and heart for I felt the pressure within me, and without me, like a suit of insupportable armour, weighing me down; while my arteries ran with cold lead. `Where shall we go, brother?' said he—after another deep silence—`it is getting dark—can you walk so far as the farm?' `Yes.' He took my arm, affectionately, and we proceeded, in a silence so pleasant, yet so uncommon, that I wept, as we wandered, together, over the well known place, of our childhood, until we approached the scene of all our suffering. But there, we—we— No, I will not, attempt to describe our emotion. It was the first time that we had been, together, at the farm, since it arose, with the same features, from the ashes and blackness of the old mansion. For a moment, it was like an apparition before us. For a moment, so complete was the resemblance of the present buildings, in all their substantial, disordered shaping and relationship, that a delusion took hold of us—and we forgot that it was a counterfeit. We had then—after a shock, that jarred every nerve in our bodies, leisure to remark the exceeding closeness of the imitation. All was there, that we had ever seen, even to the trees, which had been consumed—and we fell upon each other's neck, and wept aloud—wondering, for a time, by what preternatural agency, all this had been done for our bruised hearts, in silence. But, we soon knew the secret. The amiable old man, who managed the farm, and superintended the buildings, had transplanted trees from the forest, to the places, where there had been others blasted and burnt with fire. Heaven bless him for it! I shall never sleep, quietly, in any grave, that is not dug beneath that old tree, at the left of my window. There! it is!— there!—withered and sapless, like myself; but venerable, even in its decay. Every wind that blows over it; every rain that beats upon it; drenches its old heart; or blows away a part of its strength. How like the going down of a strong man, to the chambers of death! The winds go by me, and my grey hair is upon them— the rains beat into my bosom; and my heart turns cold and stony with their buffeting. We slept together that night. I was strangely miserable; and yet, I could not avoid talking, all night long, upon the prohibited theme. `Brother,' said I—`what think you, at this time, of your own situation?—Do you despair of recovery?' VOL. II 22* `I despair of nothing,' said he. `It is not in my nature to despair. But I have done speaking of myself. I have promised, inwardly, to trouble no man, while I live, with sorrow, or complaint, or repining. Come what will, I am now prepared for it; what little good I can do, I will do; that, when God shall beckon to my spirit, it may depart in peace.' `There are comfort and consolation in the very tones of your voice, Archibald,' said I—`I—pray tell me, if I be not trespassing upon your patience. How do you stand affected toward Lucia?' `Brother!' he replied—somewhat startled at my abruptness, I could perceive.—`Brother—I—I hardly know. She is evidently much better; I never saw her so beautiful; and, if there be tenderness or truth in woman, a broken hearted woman, I am persuaded that—no brother, I am wrong—I ought not to breathe her name, except in my prayers.' `But what think you of her?' `Think of her!' said he, rising in his bed—and sitting up, in the troubled star light, just so that I could see the shape of his head thrown back, and his locked hands elevated;—`think of Lucia Arnauld!—this! that she is one of the most extraordinary women, that ever lived; that, could we have been together, forever, and understood the temper of each other as we do now, she would have made me—God only knows what! but I could die for her—even now.' `Even now—Archibald,' said I, significantly. `What do you mean by that?' said he dropping his hands.—`Your voice changes—what mean you?' `It matters not,' said I—recollecting myself—`I agree with you, in your opinion of her. What think you of her health?' `I hardly know,' he replied calmly—`they say that she will be well again; but, they say the same of me; poor ideots!—Yet, I do believe that she is better. Would that I could prolong her dear life, with my hearts blood! I would stand over a cauldron, and let it run, hot and smoking into it, if that would cure her.' `Less may cure her.' `Less! what?' `Your love.' `My love! she has it.' `Your hand—marry her, Archibald, marry her— ah!—' A deep silence followed; the bed shook, and I leaped out of mine, and ran to his. He was lifeless— covered with dampness; and his hands were clenched like locked iron. It was with difficulty, that I was able to release him, from the hold that he had caught; but, I did, at last, and bore him to the window, which was open. He revived; but, I was afraid to speak again, till— I felt the wind blowing upon his hot forehead, as he leaned against my cheek. He was in my arms, like a sick child; and, his hands hung, powerless, over the back of my chair. I moved them, and put my hand to his temples; they were burning hot, and the sweat stood on them, like a summer rain. `Do you believe?' said he, faintly—`I see brother that this question is not inconsiderately put to me. You have thought of it before—others have thought of it— well, well—do you believe that Lucia would be happier, for a single moment,—were she my wife?' `I do—' `But if she knew that she must be a widow soon?' `It matters not,' said I—`not at all—though she be your widow, before the benediction has done sounding in your ears; it will make her happy. She has some doubt now; she cannot but have some, of—of your respect for her; I mean sincerely. It preys upon her. Marry her—and—I know all brother—all!—do not shake so—do not, I pray you—would you die in my arms? You are terribly still, Archibald, terribly!—what ails you?—speak! brother, speak!—why do you not speak.' A low groan broke from his heart; he arose, and stood up. `I will marry her,' said he. `God forever bless you, Archibald!' `And when?' `Immediately—immediately; let no time be lost.' This was the substance of our conversation that night. By day break we were on our way to the ground, where he broke down, to the rescue of Clinton. He stood, looking upon it with a working lip, and eyes full, to overflowing; but he spoke not—no, not a word—until we had left it for half an hour. `We are getting old, brother,' said he—`very old. I feel like one that has worn out his appointment of three score years and ten, outstayed the sojourn permitted to man. Men talk about years and months and days. I measure time by vicissitude—trial—sorrow, blood. Look at me; but a few summers have gone over me. I am what the world calls a young man; but, to my notion, I am older than the patriarchs. I have out lived all the pleasant emotions of the heart, all remembrance of my childhood; the beauty of heaven— the clear water, the green branching tree, the sporting bird—the—the bright lip of woman, and her love— have turned to ashes, in my sight—I. Let us journey a little further.—We are near our first battle ground.' `No, it is about five miles from this place.' About sunset, we came to the place. It was all overgrown with sedge and rushes—very rank and vivid. `The soil is hot and fruitful,' said he, bitterly—`fat with human blood. This growth of vegetation is new here. I can remember when it was all barren about this spot. These rushes (breaking a handful and bruising them)—should yield blood, at the bidding of a hand like mine—awful—is it not brother? to see the material of man, his hot heart, his valourous blood, his strong sinews shooting out, with beneficent greenness, like this.—Look!—this handful of rushes, and these beautiful wild flowers—may be but the herbage and blossom of some young heart.' `Let us go! in God's name, let us go.' We departed—and arrived at night, worn out and exhausted with the walk, at Mr. Arnauld's —as we approached the house, he took my hand—`not a word of what we have spoken,' said he—`until I have tried her heart.' `Right,' I replied, returning the pressure—while my blood ran pleasantly home, at the sight of his red lips, smiling sorrowfully to be sure, but smiling, nevertheless, as he departed, in pursuit of Lucia. Just as I was getting into bed, he came to me—and embraced me. `It is as you believe,' said he—`she has owned it. What a noble creature! she has consented—heaven bless her!—and, now all that I have to say is—let not an hour be lost. I have my reasons. No matter what they are. It ought to satisfy you, to know that I have them—will you press the arrangements.' `Will I?—O, with more pleasure than I would my own marriage, were Clara and I, unwed, at this blessed hour.' `Well, well—to-morrow then, let the preparation be begun. I am sure of all the family—and sure of her —except Clara—she is full of deep propriety.' `I will answer for Clara,' said I. `True, for her consent,' he replied, `but not perhaps, for so precipitate a consummation —when will she return?' `To-morrow, with her father,' said I. She is a kind creature,' said he, never to leave you, till you have left her. Good night.' `Good night!' It was now Wednesday; and, before two days had gone over our heads, all the necessary preparations had been made; and the time of the nuptials settled for the coming Sunday night. Ah, how happy we were! All our faces were, literally, wet with joy—we could not pass each other, any of the family, though it were a hundred times in a day, without a shake of the hand, a smile of congratulation, or a blessing. Sunday came. It was a beautiful day. Archibald was very cheerful, or rather equable and serene; it was not so much cheerfulness, as the serious countenance of a good man, about to prove his religion. The morning was spent in the presence of our clergyman, the same that had married Mary, Ellen and Clara, in religious devotion. The dinner was late; and, to our happiness, there came a bundle of letters, containing the most grateful intelligence from Copely and Rodman: of their health—comfort, and the prospect of peace. The pious man remembered it in his prayer; and, after a bumper to Washington, and `absent friends,' of currant wine, that made our hearts leap, with recollection; (for the last time, that we had tasted that vintage, was at our marriage before,) we adjourned to the large parlour. A walk was proposed; and we sauntered about, Archibald and Lucia dropping behind, (for an unpleasant illness had fallen upon him, suddenly, twice within a few days; and he was not able to walk far, though he never looked fuller of life and power,) and conversing with a tender solemnity, which, though we heard nothing of the words, came to us in the sound of their voices, with the effect of prayer. After a pleasant ramble, we returned, and entered, altogether, into conversation, with a freedom that astonished me. The windows were all open; the light, in our room, was pale and beautifully dim; the wind was blowing about, scented with the blossoming wilderness at the portico, where innumerable plants and flowers were flourishing, and sweating perfume and lustre. `How sweet and holy!' said Lucia, uplifting her dimmed eyes, to Archibald, who stood leaning over her, as she sat, and holding by the open casement above. `Pray, sit down, brother,' said I; you will stand in need of all your self-possession.' `I shall, indeed,' he said, in a manner, that I remember well, had a slight effect upon my feeling then; but it was soon forgotten. `You are serious, Lucia,' said he, affectionately, putting his hand upon her shoulder. `Should I not be, at such an hour, with such a man,' she replied, putting her's upon it. `I never saw the marriage of another, but with a feeling strangely unlike that of women in general. It is not that I am more timid, or less sanguine, or steadier; but, somehow or other, there is a deep—deep solemnity in the ceremony that awes me.' `Yes, Lucia—know each other, as we may; there may be, untold, and terrible things within us; thoughts that cannot be uttered; a hidden temper, that no man dare avow. You smile—love. I do not speak of myself; and then, there are trials and sorrows, unknown to any other than the married heart; obligation, to be encountered, that he, who dares not think of, must be an ideot; and that he, who thinks of, without trembling, must be a— a — I hardly know what to call him. He should never be a father. Sudden blows too, may fall upon us. They that have loved us—they may be smitten sorely, while we have no power to help or comfort them. We may be weary of the world—widowed and desolate. A fearful survivorship may happen. You weep Lucia—weep on, dear. It is our duty to be prepared for all that may happen. I am so. I regard our existence here, but as a continual favour—continually repeated; a protracted miracle; for sorrow and disappointment, and illness have taught me, that there is no wisdom—in looking for one hour of certain happiness.' `For shame, Archibald,' said Ellen; `would you make us all hide our faces? come, come, no billing and cooing—yet— Gracious heaven! what—crying! crying together! absolutely crying together! Why—Lord help you! you are not married yet!' `Hush, hush, saucebox,' said Archibald; `we are only rehearsing.' Ellen tugged at his arm, and finally led him away from Lucia, to where the clock stood. `See!' she exclaimed, `fifteen—sixteen—sixteen minutes and a half, left to you, yet—to repent and be saved.' The minister looked serious. Archibald stopped before the clock, and stood, looking at it, in silence. `Yes,' said he—`yes! What a remarkable coincidence!' `What are you muttering about? Some incantation I suppose,' said the implacable Ellen; `to stop the hands; Lucia Arnauld!—Lucia Arnauld! he is in treaty with evil spirits already.' Lucia arose with a pleasant step, and came near to him. He turned. `You are very pale, Archibald,' said she. `I am,' he replied, fixing his eyes upon the clock. `Yes—very—pray sit down—pray do.' `No, dear Lucia—no. It must not be. Let me take your arm. There is a faintness here—it will soon be over—a mistiness. Sir! Mr. Arnauld—my friend— let the ceremony begin. This suspense is insupportable.' `Not till six,' said Mr. Arnauld gravely, `that is the hour.' `Immediately. I pray you,' said Archibald, very earnestly; `immediately—I pray you—it might be too late.' Lucia moved nearer to him, and pressed his hands, while she turned her dark eyes wistfully in his face; but, though there was a mortal paleness on his forehead, yet his blue eyes were pre-eminently expressive, tender and beautiful. Where I stood, which was about five or six feet from him, I was astonished at a phenomenon that was visible to me. A thin vapour rose, continually, from his hair, like the mist from wet ground at night; and his forehead glittered with the dew of his heart. Yet it was not unpleasantly warm. I was on the point of speaking; but, at that moment, the clergyman stepped forward—placed her hand in Archibald's, with a benevolent smile—while a look of noble compassion was bent upon Archibald, as he did so, expressive of uncommon respect and love. And who would not have felt the same? His remarkable expression—full of wisdom and corrected passion; the tamed haughtiness of his red lips; the deep, passionate blue of his eyes, tempered, in their brilliancy, by some hidden and mysterious feeling, as if he were in the expectation of something, that we were all unprepared for. Such, at least was his appearance. It may be that I have fancied this, since; but, my belief is, that, at that time, while I stood before him, the same opinion arose within me. The ceremony went on; and, such was the solemnity and low tenderness of the clergyman's voice; the profound devotion apparent in the countenance of Archibald: the beautiful conlusion, and quick tumult of pale and red, upon the face of Lucia—rushing like sun-set shadows over summer foliage—as rapid and varied, that most of us were affected, even to tears. The benediction was pronounced. Archibald turned —bent forward, and put his lips to the mouth of his bride—trembled from head to foot—attempted to rise— but he could not—again and again—but his head fell on her shoulder. `God of heaven!' cried Mr. Arnauld, thunderstruck at his mortal paleness, and the strange helplessness that came over him; `I never saw a human being, so agitated in all my life: why, even Lucia is firmer. Lean on me, Archibald.' `No, father,' said Lucia; `no! I am his wife now. He shall lean on no living creature, while I am able to support him—my husband!' `Lucia, my wife!' he uttered, faintly, pulling her forehead down to his lips, while she stood over him, pressing his damp temples to her heart. `I— ah! one kiss love! one—one—be prepared Lucia—I— ah!'— He stood suddenly erect upon his feet; the light flashed over his face. It was the face of a dead man. He fell upon the floor: a loud shriek followed. Where were we?—Where! We ran to him—we raised him up. It was too late! Almighty God! it was too late! HIS WIFE WAS A WIDOW! THE END.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ERRATA. The author might, if he would permit himself to implicate a friend, allege a sufficient excuse for the greater part of the following errours. Yet in justice to himself, he cannot help saying, that nearly ninety-nine out of one hundred are not his, [the author's,] and are chiefly attributable to the difficulty that he experienced in obtaining proofs, before the forms were worked off, under the eye of his friend; and to the extreme badness of the manuscript. N. B. Points are omitted, throughout the work; and superfluous points are to be found in every page; but I aim only at correcting absurdities, that might mislead the inexperienced.
