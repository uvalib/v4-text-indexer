      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER I There are few portions of our country more beautiful, and none more rich with historic recollections, than the valley of the Mohawk, Yet few, probably, of the throngs, who, steam-impelled, pass daily through this beautiful region, yielding to its many scenes of enchantment the tribute of admiration, pause to reflect upon the fearful and momentous deeds of which it has been the scene, and which are destined in after ages to render every inch of its soil classic ground. But not of thee, beautiful river, peacefully gliding through the broad and verdant champaign, laving with thy silvery waters, the lips of the bending flowers upon thy margin, or with gentle wrath foaming, glistening and leaping amid the cataracts of Astorogan; nor yet of you, oh towering mountains, still forest-clad; not of you, as ye now exist, the scenes and the occasions of innocent enjoyment, is the historic muse about to speak. But of man, staining your soil with blood, freighting your gales with groans, and startling your frightened echoes with war's discordant notes; and yet of man, too, thank Heaven, in holier and gentler mood, and less at war with the beauty and harmony of creation. It was in the twilight of a calm July evening, just seventy years ago, that two young men, lightly clad, and each bearing a rifle, might have been seen loitering upon the bank of the Mohawk, at a point near to what is now a large and populous town. Although at first sight the casual observer would have taken them for sportsmen in pursuit of game, a little closen investigation would have convinced him that such was not the case, but that their arms were carried only as part of an habitual system of precaution in those troublous times, when no man knew at what moment he might stumble upon a deadly foe. Charles Dudley and Enoch Waldon were citizens of one neighborhood, and had been acquaintances from their boyhood. They were not, however, and never had been, friends. There was no approach to congeniality in their dispositions, the first being frank and generous, while the other was characterized by qualities in every respect the reverse of those noble traits. They had now met by accident, and stopped to exchange such few words of constrained civility as people are wont to utter, who, while they entertain for each other a secret dislike, are still willing to avoid an open quarrel. But the deportment of Waldon was marked with a sort of obsequiousness to his companion, which might have indicated to one less suspicious than Dudley, some sinister design. “Stirring times are these,” he said, glancing at his weapon, after a moment's pause in conversation. “It becomes one to look well to his flint and flask.” A* “It does, indeed,” replied Dudley. “I hope there have been no new massacres committed.” “I do n't know exactly about the massacres,” said Waldon, emphasising the word. “Indians have their way of fighting and we have ours. But there certainly was a night attack made at Shell's Bush night before last, and houses burnt, lives lost, and prisoners taken, as usual.” “This is fearful intelligence, Mr. Waldon, and, what is worse, we know not at what hour the bolt may fall upon us. You will, of course, join the Life Guard which we are organizing?” “I intend to join quite a different service, I assure you,” said Waldon, “and one in which a little more honor and profit can be gained than in guarding a few old women and their spinning wheels. Col. St. Leger is now on his approach to Fort Stanwix, and under his banner I shall enlist without delay. Nay, hear me,” he said, as the withering scorn which had gathered on the face of his companion indicated a scathing rebuke, “St. Leger will reduce Fort Stanwix in three days. With the aid of the loyalists in this country, the rebellion in this section is sure to be immediately quelled, with little or no bloodshed. Intelligence from the south and east is equally favorable to the royal cause. If, therefore, you desire to serve your country effectually, Dudley, be persuaded to go with me. The most brilliant inducements are held out, and for you, in particular, influential and brave, a commission would be certain—I may say, ineded, that I am authorized to offer it, by those who have the full confidence of St. Leger.” “Enough has been said,” replied Dudley, with dignity; “let us part while our blood is cool. Go,—join St. Leger to devastate your native land, or join, if you prefer, the savage brigands and their more savage allies, whose atrocities you palliate. When we meet again, it will be as enemies.” Thus saying, he turned to depart. “Hold!” exclaimed the other, snatching his rifle, as if he would enforce attention, “we are enemies now!” Stung by resentment, and maddened by the thought that his plans had been prematurely and uselessly disclosed, his eye now gleamed with undisguised rage. That still another element entered into his wrath became evident by his words. “We are enemies now,” he repeated, “and I have a warning to bestow. You have had thoughts of Miss Welles. She is mine, affianced and plighted by her father, who, with me, is about to join the royal standard. See to it that my rights are regarded. Any invasion of them in that quarter will be visited by punishment summary and condign.” He tapped his weapon significantly as he concluded. Dudley's eyes flashed with anger. “Do you dare to threaten me?” he said, laying hold of his companion's rifle with a firm grasp. “Me, who know you, Enoch Waldon, to be as cowardly as perfidious? If you are affianced to Ellen Welles, it is because her pure heart has never detected your baseness. But words between us are useless. I leave however, no armed foe in my rear.” So saying, he wrested the weapon of the other suddenly from his grasp, discharged its contents into the air, and flinging it upon the ground, disappeared in the forest. Mortified and infuriated, Waldon gave utterance to some impotent imprecations, and then, having recovered and re-loaded his gun, rapidly departed in an opposite direction.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER II. We are apt when dwelling in the sunshine of peace, to look upon the season of war as one of unmitigated horror. We forget that man is powerless effectually to mar the fair face of nature, or intercept the smiles of Heaven. We forget that the fields still are verdant, the streams still sparkling, the sun-lit canopy by day, and the starry firmament at night, still beautiful and sublime, amidst all the puny tempests of human strife. The mind, too, buoyant and elastic with hope, and containing within itself the secret springs of joy, bids defiance at times, to every peril, and often seems least desponding, when dangers and trials are the most numerous and severe. The twilight had gradually disappeared, and the moon, riding high in the heavens, was illuminating the landscape, as Dudley pursued his homeward way. Hill, dale and stream, bathed in a flood of silvery light, lay spread around him far as the eye could reach, and for a while engrossed his undivided attention. But sadder themes soon pressed upon his mind. The massacre at Shell's Bush, of which Waldon had so unfeelingly spoken, was one of similar deeds to those which had been already perpetrated in the valley of the Mohawk. They were the work of savages, aided and instigated by some of the lowest and vilest of the white inhabitants, who, having declared in favor of the royal cause, made it a cover for the perpetration of every enormity which either private revenge or the most sordid cupidity could dictate. Although these atrocities usually occurred and were most to be dreaded in the darker nights, they were by no means confined to such seasons, the full light of the moon, and the broad glare of day, affording no protection to the peaceable inhabitants when the war spirit of their savage foes was fully aroused. On again viewing the sky, Dudley beheld a belt of dense clouds skirting the western horizon, from which, detached fragments were occasionally ascending zenith-ward, threatening ere long to obscure the whole firmament; and he shuddered as he thought that perhaps some fearful tragedy might be enacted upon that very night. Nor were these apprehensions his only source of disquiet. Other griefs of a private and more selfish nature also engaged his attention. The claim made by Waldon on the affections of Miss Welles, although little worthy of credit, was not without its effect upon his mind. It had revealed to him the state of his own feelings, of which he had before scarcely been conscious, and at the same time had conjured up phantoms of obstacles to his hopes, which, with all a lover's variableness of feeling, at one moment seemed shadowy, and at the next, insuperable. Ellen Welles was a lady well calculated to inspire affection in such a heart as Dudley's. The ordinary charms of youth and beauty were enhanced in her person, by a natural grace of manner, and an unalloyed sweetness of temper. If a judgment, just and discriminating, was necessary to prevent such a character from degenerating into insipidity, that gift also was Ellen's. Her father was a military man, and had held a Captain's commission under Sir William Johnson in the war of 1756. He had purchased at the close of that contest, a large estate in Tryon county, which the advancing settlement of the country had rendered highly valuable, and at the period now spoken of was what, in more modern parlance, would be termed a large landed proprietor. It was no matter of surprise to Dudley that Captain Welles should have again offered his services to the crown; but he wondered much what provisions he had made for the security of Ellen, who was an only child, and who had long before been deprived of her other parent. But had he been so disposed, he might have solved his curiosity by a direct appeal to the object of it; for Ellen Welles at that moment stood before him. She was accompanied by a single domestic, who bore a few articles of value in his hands; and her deportment gave token of alarm and agitation. Her answers to his busy inquiries were exactly what he had expected to hear. Her father was absent from home; there were rumors of expected attacks from the Indians, and she was hastening to place herself under the protection of a neighboring family; for although Captain Welles was well known to be loyal in his sentiments, his house was too secluded, and presented too many temptations to the plunderers, to be a safe abode for an unprotected female. That Dudley at once became her escort, that he strove in every way to soothe her alarm, although far from considering it unfounded, and that he promised such protection as he could give, were quite matters of course. On arriving at the house which Ellen had selected for refuge, its inmates were found to be in a state of alarm nearly equal to her own. The intelligence of the expected attack had spread like wild-fire through the little community, where the merciless character of these onsloughts was well understood. The owner of the house, Mr. Lee, who was a well-known patriot, was, together with his sons, busily engaged in making such hasty preparations for defense, as time allowed. Doors and windows were barricaded, ammunition prepared, and weapons put in order with all that bustling activity which such an emergency might well be supposed to create. The panic in the vicinity had become general, and several other of the immediate neighbors, whose houses were considered less defensible than Lee's, were soon seen flocking to his little fort, with their arms and ammunition and such of their more valuable effects as they could conveniently transport. Lee's reputation as a bold and resolute man, contributed not a little to produce this result, although it might be considered a very questionable prudence which sought shelter under a roof rendered, by the very reputation of its owner, so prominent an object of hostility. The work of defense now went more rapidly forward. A breastwork of logs was soon thrown up in front of the house, and another opposite the postern door; and upon the roof of the building, blankets, saturated with water, were spread as a protection from that most formidable engine of Indian warfare—the fire-brand. Dudley having become convinced of the reality of the danger, hastened to summon to Lee's, such other of the neighbors as did not choose rather to seek the shelter of the forest, being conscious that their chief hope of safety must consist in thus consolidating their strength. He had no immediate relatives in the vicinity to awaken his solicitude, and was able to act the more efficiently for the whole. With many injunctions to regard his personal safety, and one from a voice which he fondly fancied to be Ellen's, he departed on his mission. He found the neighborhood everywhere alarmed. Some were secreting their effects, preparatory to flight; some were barricading their premises, determined to die, if necessary, on their hearth-stones; and others, in small bands, were fleeing to the forests, bearing their children in their arms, and upholding the tottering steps of the sick and the aged. The scene was one to draw tears from the stoutest heart, but the necessity for speedy action, left little room for contemplation. Dudley had a word of encouragement and hope for all, and although numbers gladly accepted his proposal, and hastened to accompany him, the majority preferred to trust to the hiding-places of the wilderness. He was more successful, however, in gaining refugees than recruits. Women and children would add but little to the effective force of the garrison, and he was, therefore, not a little delighted at the accession to his numbers of four or five members of the half-organized band, bearing the imposing title of the Life Guard. These were all young men, well-armed, and, by the presence and peril of those most near and dear to them, furnished them with the loftiest incentives to action.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER III. The little company were soon assembled, and set out together for their temporary fortress. The strictest silence was enjoined, it being impossible to tell how near the enemy might be, or where his advanced scouts would be met. The precaution did not prove superfluous, for they were yet a third of a mile distant from Lee's, when they received convincing proof of their langer. The silence was suddenly broken by a trenendous war-whoop; shouts and shots echoed through he air, and soon the kindling light of a deserted farmhouse, revealed the exulting foe, flitting like fiends around the tenement from which they expected soon to see their victims issue. Appalled at this dreadful spectacle, the little party paused and remained for a while breathless spectators of the scene. The relative positions of the fugitives, the foe, and the fort, (for such we must designate the residence of Lee,) were about as the extremities of an equal-sided triangle to each other. The latter could not be gained without emerging from the woods, and crossing a considerable space of cleared land, which was an undertaking too hazardous to be contemplated. Resuming their route, therefore, with the greatest precaution, they obtained the nearest position to Lee's that the cover of the forest would permit, hoping thence to pass unperceived across the intervening space, which had now become diminished to about thirty rods. But at this moment, the enemy, after an impotent howl of rage at finding the burning house unoccupied, took up their march. With frantic gesticulations, some bearing lighted fire-brands, and others brandishing their knives, they bent their course, as had been apprehended, directly toward the fort. But, perceiving some signs of defense, they made a detour around the premises, in a course which threatened to bring them almost directly to the concealed party. To remain in the most perfect silence was deemed safer than any attempt to retreat before the quick eye and ear of the savages. The available portion of Dudley's force, consisting of seven armed men, obeying the whispered orders of their leader, stood with presented arms, ready, in case of discovery, to discharge a sudden volley upon the enemy, and then, by virtue of the panic which such an assault would create, either to cut B their way through the foe to the fort, or make a rapid retreat, as circumstances would dictate. Dudley, by general consent, had been invested with the entire command. As the savages drew nearer, they were perceived to be about sixty in number—including perhaps ten or twelve whites, who, having adopted the dress and habits of their confederates, may justly be considered as entitled also to their appellation. With glistening knives, with glaring brands, with exulting shouts, they came nearer and nearer, until their advance was scarcely a dozen yards distant from the hidden encampment. Here, they suddenly paused and seemed to hold a consultation. It was a moment of fearful suspense. Trembling children cowered closer to their terrified parents, and with large blue eyes upraised, faithfully obeyed the often repeated signs of silence. The pause was but momentary; but at the instant of renewing their march, one of the concealed company unfortunately gave utterance to a slight ejaculation of delight, which, catching the quick ear of the Indian leader, produced a second halt. Pointing to the woods, and assuming a listening attitude for a moment, he thus communicated to his followers the nature of his suspicions. A scout was immediately detached to examine the suspected cover; but waatchful eyes and active hands awaited his approach. He directed his course at once to the encampment, but with such rapid and incautious steps, that, before perceiving the ambush, he was at the side of Dudley, who had advanced a step to meet him. The expressive “huh!” rose faintly to his lips as the firm grasp of the youth encircled his throat, while the silent knife completed the task, and the dying Indian was upheld, lest his fall should be heard. The savages, after the delay of a minute or two, hearing no alarm, slowly resumed their course, not doubting that their emissary would soon overtake them. They pursued their circuitous way about the house of Lee, evidently calculating their safest plan of attack. Nothing can be more cowardly than this mode of Indian warfare, in which the assailants scarcely consider themselves as victorious, unless they succeed without losing a single warrior. As they approached the opposite side of the circle, the time had evidently arrived when, if at all, the fugitives were to emerge from their concealment, and make a rush for the fort. To remain longer in the forest, which the Indian scouts would soon be traversing in every direction, would be imminently perilous, and with many a word of encouragement, Dudley put his little company in motion. Rapidly advancing, they had safely crossed nearly half the intervening space, when a sudden commotion in the ranks of the foe, showed that they were perceived. A shout and a rush, with such speed as Indians only can accomplish, followed the discovery. The fugitives, it will be remembered, were now about fifteen rods from the house, and the savages twice that distance, in nearly the opposite direction. The race was exciting, but not long doubtful. The enemy were still obliged to avoid too close a proximity to the house, and Dudley, halting with his little band of infantry, held them in check until the women and children were out of danger, and then, still facing the foe, with presented arms, they retreated into the fort. No shot was fired.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER IV. A piercing shrick, which met the ear of Dudley, upon his entrance, announced some new calamity. A little boy, scarce two years old, had been lost in the confusion of the flight, and his mother, borne along by her impetuous companions, had been unable to make her vociferations understood until they reached the fort. Upbraiding herself, upbraiding her friends, and vainly struggling to escape from their grasp and fly back to the rescue, the frantic parent rent every heart with her cries. The moonlight still remaining unobscured, the infant, on examination, was distinctly seen, about twelve rods distant, seated quietly upon the grass, and playing with the flowers, unconscious of danger. The discovery was made none too soon. An Indian, prone upon the ground, now lying motionless, like a log, and now approaching the child with a slow and cat-like gait, was at the same instant discovered, while the whole band at a safe distance were silently watching his hazardous attempt. A dozen rifles were at once leveled at the miscreant, when Dudley interposed: “For shame!” he said, “will you let one worthless dog draw your whole fire, and ensure the capture of the child, while we are re-loading? The game is Lee's by discovery. Rogers will stand ready to fire next, if necessary; and if both fail, leave the scoundrel to me.” Uncle Lee, as he was familiarly called, smiled as he raised his unerring gun, and its quick report was accompanied by a yell that seemed to proclaim the success of the shot. The Indian started from his recumbent position, and then fell heavily backward. “If he were a Christian now, we might suppose him dead,” exclaimed Rogers, who had watched the effect of Lee's shot with a look of chagrin, “but I have my doubts. Captain,” he said, addressing Dudley, and raising his gun beseechingly, “that fall was a little too theatrical.” “Do n't you go to shooting dead men, Mr. Rogers,” exclaimed Lee, “I tell you I have killed him.” Dudley, whose suspicions from the first had been the same as those of Rogers, made a signal to the latter to fire, which he had no sooner done than the dead man rose to his feet, with a screech that could not be misunderstood, then sinking gradually to his knee, he fell shivering to the ground, with indubitable signs of death. Rogers smiled grimly as he retorted upon his companion: “'T is n't much to kill an Indian, Mr. Lee; it 's the bringing him to life again that shows the skill.” If any doubt had been entertained of the fatality of the last fire, the yell of wrath which arose from the Indians, and the volley which was discharged at the helpless infant, would have effectually dispelled them. But the distance which the cowardly assailants were compelled to keep, and the minuteness of the mark, fortunately rendered their fire innocuous. It was evident, however, that the child in so exposed a situation, could not long escape. “It is a shame,” said Dudley, “that a helpless babe should perish, and twelve strong men look idly on. I myself will save him.” B* Thus saying, he threw down his gun, that nothing might retard his speed, and prepared to rush out. But the firm grasp of Lee was on his shoulder. “It is certain death,” said the old man; “you will be a mark for thirty rifles.” “And if it were thirty thousand, I would go,” retorted Dudley, inpetuously, and tearing himself away. But at this moment, a singular apparition entered the room, which, whether or not it was anything more than a huge tin Dutch oven, surmounted by an inverted pail of the same material, was certainly nothing less. It required a little investigation to perceive signs of a human being under this extraordinary coat of mail, but in a moment more, a voice proceeding from under the kettle, proclaimed a well-known slave of Lee's by the name of Nando. Merely announcing his object, the faithful negro darted out of the house, and, presenting his shielded side to the enemy, ran hastily toward the child. There was one moment of fearful suspense; a yell, a volley, and a responsive shout of derision from the slave. At the next, Nando bent over the wondering child, thrust him hastily within his capacious shield, and, rushing rapidly back, reached the house in safety. The cordial greetings, the welcoming grasp, the wet eyes, and the warm out-pourings of a mother's gratitude that here encountered him, astonished and bewildered the heroic African; while the marred and battered utensil, told eloquently the tale of his danger and his daring.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER V. The event most desirable for the savages, and for which they had probably been waiting, now unfortunately occurred. The heavy drifting clouds which had long blackened the western horizon, began now to obscure the whole sky, and a thick darkness soon settled upon the landscape. To fire the building, and to compel its evacuation, and thus to capture and massacre the whole party, whilst its defenders had no advantage of shelter, and were impeded by the care of their women and children, was the chivalrous feat which the besiegers now contemplated. The danger could not be concealed, and hope consisted only in meeting it courageously. In a momentary interview which Dudley obtained at this period with Miss Welles, the latter communicated to him the dreadful suspicion that one of the leaders of the enemy was Enoch Waldon, whom she believed that she had recognized both by his figure and gait. Although horrified at the supposition, there was also a gleam of pleasure in the announcement; for whether Waldon was so deeply guilty or not, the fact that he could be obnoxious to such a suspicion, precluded the idea of her entertaining for him partial feeling. Animated by an increased hope, Dudley begged Ellen to consider herself under his especial protection, and, with an earnest and eloquent look, he added, not to believe herself in danger while he continued to live. There was nothing in the words, but there must have been something in the manner of the speaker to call the quick blood into the cheek of Ellen. Hurridly thanking him, she turned away, and Dudley, with a comparatively light heart, hastened to prepare for further defense. Placing two or three men at the several windows, so as to command, to some extent, every side of the house, he directed them to keep up a random fire, in hopes that the besiegers would be intimidated from a near approach. For a while, this plan seemed to succeed, and no sound of the foe being detected, the belief was entertained, that they were effectually repulsed. But the more wary were not disposed to such ready hope. The silence was too deep and ominous. Alarmed by the very quietude without, Dudley, after ordering increased vigilance on every side, announced his determination to ascend to the house-top, and called upon three or four of his most resolute companions to follow him. A small “sky-light” afforded means for effecting this object, and with extreme silence and caution, Dudley ascended only until his head had fully emerged into the open air. Pausing to reconnoitre the adjacent fields, his eye was immediately arrested by what, at first, seemed a few fire-flies flitting about the roof. With a sudden and fearful suspicion, he remained motionless, and made a close scrutiny. Feeling cautiously about him, he ascertained that the wetted blankets had been removed, and the conviction that the roof was already in possession of the savages, forced itself upon his mind. His position was nearly at one-extremity of the building, which was long and narrow, with a single chimney at the opposite end. Peering earnestly through the thick darkness, he at length discovered part of the outline of several figures in a stooping attitude. The sound of breath, as in the act of blowing at embers, also reached his ear from several quarters, and convinced him that the Indians were at that moment engaged in setting fire to the building. His prudence for the moment almost yielded to the quick feeling of rage which prompted him to rush headlong upon so diabolical a foe; but restraining his wrath, he immediately drew back and communicated to his astonished companions the nature of his discovery. His resolution was immediately taken. The sky-light, which was gained only by moveable steps, would admit of only three persons standing within it; and having stationed that number of his little garrison at the foot of the steps with reserve guns, he called upon Lee and Rogers to follow him, and once more ascended, with the same perfect silence as before. Rising until their shoulders were above the roof, the three remained standing, motionless, with presented arms. It was, doubtless, a hazardous experiment for the besieged party to wait for the kindled light of their own roof to reveal the persons of their foes; but the importance of striking a signal blow, and one that might deter the enemy from making any further attack overcame every other consideration. The dampened state of the shingles rendered the process of ignition slow; but at length, a faint bue flame made its appearance in the vicinity of the chimney, where a number of small faggots had been carefully inserted. Flickering with the wind, now sinking, now rising, the unsteady blaze was guarded from the air by both hands of a kneeling Indian, whose fiendish features, as he bent over the light, could be distinctly traced. Brighter and brighter rose the blaze, and soon began to reveal the other objects in its vicinity, while the place occupied by Dudley and his companions remained in impenetrable obscurity. Brighter and higher still, until the alarmed inmates beneath, saw the fire gleaming downward through the chinks of the unceiled roof. But the time for action had arrived. Other faint lights had sprung up, and the savages, to the number of five, were distinctly visible, when Dudley having exchanged signals with his men, in order to select their several victims, quietly gave the command to fire. The report of the guns, and the death screech of the Indians, was a mingled and simultaneous sound. They each rolled rapidly down the roof and fell heavily to earth. But although Dudley and his comrades instantly handed down their guns and received others from below, only one of the enemy remained visible when they were again prepared to fire. Running rapidly along the apex of the building, he had already gained hold of the rope, which, thrown lasso-like over the chimney, had been the means of his ascent, and was about to swing himself off, when he received the contents of Dudley's gun. Still convulsively clutching the rope he was seen by the now growing light to totter for a moment on the extreme end of the building, when Lee, more in pity than in wrath, gave him another ball. “It would have been a hard fall for a living man,” he said, as the noise of the body striking the ground reached his ear, “but a stack of feather beds would n't have been any mercy to him now.” “Do n't be too sure,” replied Rogers, banteringly; “your dead men have a remarkable faculty of coming to life again, and I think I see the red devil now, scampering across the field with the rope in his hand!” “And a piece of the chimney, I suppose!” retorted Lee, who understood his comrade's propensity to joke too well to take offense. But the triumph which produced this temporary elation of spirits in these brave men, was far from being complete. The fire had gained a headway that demanded instant attention, and whoever ventured within its light would doubtless be a prominent mark for the outlaying foe. No time, however, was to be lost, and two brave fellows of the Life Guard already stood prepared at the foot of the stairs for the perilous enterprise. Bearing blankets, saturated with water as before, they rushed hastily to the flames. The expected volley was discharged, and unhappily, as the groans of the young men testified, not without effect. One, but slightly injured, fled hastily back, while the other, convinced of the mortal nature of his wounds, nobly resolved that his life should prove no idle forfeit. Stanching the life-blood with one hand, he dragged himself feebly from blaze to blaze, until the last flickering light was extinguished; and then, with the remnant of his failing strength, crept slowly back to his companions. Drawn hastily, but gently within, the youth was deposited upon a couch, and hasty preparations were made to examine and relieve his wounds. But observing the changing expression of his face, and obeying his significant gestures to desist, his comrades crowded with tearful eyes around his bed. “My sister?” faintly ejaculated the dying man, as he slowly turned his face toward the door. A low wail was heard without—the door opened—and the fainting maiden was supported to his bed-side. A placid smile, like sun-light, stole over the features of the youth; his lips moved, and the trembling girl bent lower and lower to hear. The whispered words with which the parting soul went upwards, were soft as sound could be, yet distinctly articulated, they fell upon every ear, “we shall meet again!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER VI. The effect on the besieged party of the melancholy occurrence which has just been narrated, was dispiriting in the extreme. They could not but feel that the lot of their comrade might soon be their own, and perhaps with circumstances of aggravated suffering. But Dudley was not without the strongest hopes that the severe repulse which the enemy had now met with would induce them entirely to withdraw, the more especially as they were not supposed to know the fatal result of their late discharge of fire-arms. The war-whoop with which they had accompanied that assault, gradually died away, and the most perfect silence again prevailed without. Dudley continued to order occasional shots from the window, but they elicited no response. The utmost vigilance was used, and every possible preventive measure employed, not omitting so serviceable an agent against a scaling foe as boiling water, a department of defense under the special superintendence of Nando. But these precautions proved superfluous, and the night passed without further alarm. Baffled and mortified, the savages had retired, bearing with them the bodies of six of their fallen warriors; a loss, which seemed to them of almost irreparable magnitude. Thus the gallant defense of Fort Lee the less, as it was subsequently termed, proved not only the security of its inmates, with one lamentable exception, but, for the time at least, of the whole surrounding settlement. Mutual congratulations on their escape, and thanks-givings for so signal a protection of Providence, were among the earliest employments of the little party on the ensuing morning. But the panic which had spread through the neighborhood did not really subside. Some indeed, returned immediately to their homes, relying in part upon their private means of defense, but chiefly confident from their knowledge of Indian character that the enemy would not soon renew an enterprise which had proved so disastrous. A more vigilent police was organized, and a portion of the citizens nightly acted as sentinels at the prominent posts of observation. To Ellen Welles, the events which have been recorded had been doubly terrifying for a cause, which has as yet, been scarcely apparent. Waldon had in reality been a rejected claimant for her hand. His pretensions had been favored by her father, who, wrapped in his selfish and personal schemes, was as far from appreciating the worth of his daughter, as he was from penetrating the villainous character of her suitor. To his charge, during his temporary absence from home, Captain Welles had especially confided his household, enjoining Ellen, in case of danger, to appeal at once to his protection. And more recently still, Waldon had been the bearer of a message to Ellen from her father, informing her that he was engaged in raising a company of volunteers, with which he should immediately proceed to join St. Leger under the walls of Fort Stanwix. He fourther informed her that he had made suitable provision for her safety during the perilous times that were like to ensue, and directed her to accept of Waldon's escort to the place where he was then sojourning. Dreading his designs in relation to her detested suitor, yet fearing to disobey a parent, who, though harsh, was her only protector, she hesitated in most painful incertitude as to her proper course of action. But when B the messenger proceeded to hint that he was empowered to enforce the commands of his principal, her terror knew no bounds. If she had before doubted, she was now decided, and she resolved to brave every other peril sooner than to trust herself in the power of her suitor. But she did not make known her resolutions, and he, supposing her only to hesitate, specified an hour on the next day when he would call for her decision, and withdrew. It was on that evening that her flight to Lee's had occurred. But Waldon had not been a participant in the affair of the preceding night, and Ellen's suspicions on that point had doubtless been caused, in part by her dread of falling into his hands. To express her gratitude to Dudley with becoming warmth, and yet with maidenly reserve, was no difficult task for an intelligent girl; but it was tremblingly, painfully, and by slow degrees alone, that she was able to disclose, in answer to his earnest and respectful inquiries, the other particulars of her unfortunate position. Beautiful did the timid girl appear as she related her griefs, and Dudley longed for nothing so much as to throw himself at her feet and offer her a lifelong protection. But with quick discernment he appreciated the unfitness of the occasion for any declaration of his feelings. It should be, he thought, proudly, under other circumstances, when he was better entitled to ask, and she more free to refuse, that he would seek the hand and heart of one so peerless and so pure. At present, it became his duty rather to make provision for her safety, and on this subject he hastened to speak. He knew that small volunteer companies, in response to the earnest appeal of Col. Gansevoort, were daily flocking to the relief of Fort Stanwix, and had learned, on inquiry, that one of these, en route for that military post, was hourly expected in the neighborhood. He at once proposed to her to take advantage of such an escort to fly to the Fort, where she would find numbers of her own sex, who had sought the same refuge, and whence, if she should so desire, she could at any moment be transferred to her father in the British camp. She could beattended, he said, by her maid, and he, if she would permit, would accompany her and fulfil an intention that he had long entertained, of seeking service in the American Army. The same evening found the whole party, including Rogers, who had enlisted as a private, safely within the walls of the Fort.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER VII. It was but a few days subsequent to these events that Col. Gansevoort found his slightly garrisoned fort surrounded by a force of seventeen hundred men. His repeated calls for re-inforcements from the regular army, had met with nothing but promises, and unless some effectual aid should arrive, there was every reason to believe that in a few weeks, at farthest, he would be compelled to capitulate. Col. St. Leger, Sir John Johnson and Brant, the renowned Indian Chief, were among his besiegers; names, which were of themselves calculated to inspire terror among his undisciplined troops. They did not, however, deter the gallant Gen. Herkimer from making a noble effort for the relief of the garrison. By earnest appeals to the patriotism of his fellow-citizens, he succeeded in raising an army of eight hundred men, among whom were many of the first citizens of Tryon county. With these, he hastened forward by rapid marches, and pausing a few miles from the Fort, despatched couriers to notify the commandant of his approach. The discharge of artillery from the works was to announce the arrival of the messengers, and be the signal for his advance. At the same time, Col. Gansevoort, by a sortie from the Fort, was expected to assist in making good their entrance. Such was the sagacious scheme of Herkimer. But the arrival of the embassy at the Fort was delayed several hours longer than was anticipated by an accident, and his officers and men became impatient of delay, and demanded to be led forward. Herkimer declined to advance until the signal was heard; but galled by the importunities and taunts of his officers, who did not hesitate to denounce him as a coward, he gave the order to march. The ambuscade, the surprise and the bloody battle in the forests of Oriskany, are among the most memorable events of history. Although the result of the engagement was one in which it is difficult to decide the question of victory, yet the main object of the expedition was defeated. No portion of Herkimer's forces reached the garrison, and Col. Gansevoort remained in a more hopeless condition than before. He had fulfilled all that was required on his part. The sortie of Col. Willett, who gained and held possession of Sir John Johnson's camp long enough to transfer seven wagon loads of spoil, each thrice told, to the Fort, was a brilliant exploit, for which Congress voted him the nation's thanks and a sword. Capt. Welles had effected his object of joining the loyalists at Fort Stanwix, and there he learned from Waldon of the flight of Ellen. He immediately applied to his commanding officer for permission to despatch a flag to Col. Gansevoort, requesting safe conduct for his daughter to the British camp, which was granted. Had it not been for Waldon, she would not have hesitated a moment to yield obedience to the parental authority, but her dread of her suitor had become so great as to be quite insuperable. She returned a respectful answer, in which she dwelt at length upon her recent perils and her present safety, adding that she felt unable to bear any new excitement or alarm, and begging to be allowed to remain in quiet in her present abode. “If,” she ingeniously concluded, “your forces are repulsed, I shall certainly be safer here than in a traveling camp; but if, as you so confidently predict, you will be in possession of the fort within three days, you will then also be in possession of your affectionate daughter Ellen.” Dudley had found no small favor in the eyes of Col. Gansevoort. He bore a conspicuous part in the famous attack of Col. Willett on the British camp. He received a Lieutenant's commission, with the promise of speedy promotion, while his comrade, Rogers, had been raised to the rank of Sergeant. But in the mean time the prospects of the garrison grew daily more gloomy; and Col. Willett and Dudley undertook the task of making their escape from the Fort, and making a final desperate effert to rally the militia of Tryon county. They succeeded in reaching Fort Dayton, where, to their joy they learned that Gen. Arnold and Larned had already been despatched by Gen. Schuyler with the Massachusetts brigade and the first New York regiment to the relief of the Fort. Willett hastened to meet Arnold at Albany and expedite his movements, but although the latter soon arrived at Fort Dayton, countless delays occurred in getting his forces together, B* and the danger grew daily more imminent. But Dudley had not been idle during the absence of Willett. Having learned of a secret meeting of the emissaries of Sir John Johnson in the neighborhood, who were inciting the disaffected to take up arms in the royal cause, he quietly surrounded the place of meeting with a small force, and in the midst of an eloquent harangue of one of the leaders, entered the room and made the whole assembly prisoners—of these, several were immediately tried as spies and sentenced to death. This circumstance afforded the means for that memorable ruse of Gen. Arnold, of which the reader needs scarcely to be reminded. Among the condemned was a half-witted fellow named Han Yost Schuyler, for whom, at the foot of the gallows, an aged and widowed mother pleaded with all that eloquence which affection only can inspire. Arnold spared his life on condition that he would hasten to the British camp, where he was well known as a loyalist, and spread the tidings of his approach with a large force. A brother of the prisoner consented to be his hostage, and to suffer death in his stead if the other failed of fulfilling his contract. Han Yost proved faithful, and with the aid of a few friendly Indians, who assisted in his plot, met with perfect success. The body of Indians under Brant at once took the alarm, and as no inducements of St. Leger could stay them, he was compelled to raise the siege and retreat with his whole force. Dudley and Col. Willett hastened to rejoin their friends at Fort Stanwix. Here Dudley learned that Ellen had been beguilded by a counterfeit letter, purporting to have come from himself, as a prisoner, wounded and dying in the British camp, and had left the Fort under charge of an emissary of Waldon. This afflicting news was rendered still more alarming by the intelligence that Capt. Welles was mortally wounded in the battle of Oriskany. He also learned that Rogers, his faithful friend and ally in the affair at Lee's, had deserted to the enemy. To pursue the retreating army, to keep in the neighborhood of Ellen, and watch the chances which fortune might throw in his way for her rescue, was his immediate resolve. In the Fort he found two Indians who were willing to accompany him. They were brave and sagacious fellows, and as his hope of success depended less upon force than skill, the small number of his confederates was scarcely to be regretted.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER VIII. When Ellen arrived in the British camp, her delight at finding the story of Dudley's captivity and wounds untrue, scarcely left room for indignation at the fraud. Her father's extreme illness immediately engrossed her attention, until the day before the retreat of the army, when it terminated in his death. On the occurrence of this melancholy event, Ellen applied to Sir John Johnson for permission to return to the Fort. But the artful Waldon had anticipated this movement. Capt. Welles had been prevailed upon in his last hours to constitute Waldon the guardian of his child, an I had enjoined upon him to see her removed to some more loyal district. Sir John did not hesitate to say that he hoped within a few weeks, to see the guardian's power transformed into that marital authority which the late Capt. Welles had been so anxious should be established. Convinced that all effort in this quarter was useless, she next resolved to appeal to the generosity of Waldon. But she little knew the nature of the man into whose hands she had fallen. He exulted in the power which he possessed over the person and property of his ward. Circumstances required their immediate departure for Oswego, at which place he hoped for leisure and means to effect a change in her views. The arguments which she undervalued in a lover, would be more potent from the lips of a husband, in which light he begged Miss Welles to accustom herself to look upon him in future. Astounded and maddened by these threats, Ellen continued sitting in the tent which had been allotted to her use, long after Waldon's departure. When she revived she perceived that she had another companion, in whom she recognized the familiar and welcome countenance of Rogers. Enjoining the strictest secresy, the sergeant informed Ellen that he knew her danger, and that his only business in the British camp was to attempt her rescue. Rogers had joined the army as a loyalist, and not being known as a deserter, no suspicion had attached to him. He cared very little for the temporary odium of a deserter at home while he retained the confidence of Dudley, who he believed would rightly conjecture his designs.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER IX. The retreating army returned as they came, by way of Oneida Lake, and he who had watched the large flotilla on the evening of the second day after the raising of the siege, might also have seen a single boat following in the distance. It need hardly be said that it was Dudley who thus daringly followed the flying host. He was confident that Rogers was in the British camp only as his friend and ally; and he indulged the faint hope of now attracting his attention, and by some means establishing a communication with him. When the enemy encamped at night on the borders of the Lake, he retained a position in which he would be visible only to the close observer. He knew well that any attempt personally to enter the British lines, without the password, would result in his detection and an ignominious death. Dudley listened long and earnestly until he thought he heard the distant fall of oars. A few minutes convinced him that he was not mistaken. Nothing could be seen, and as the darkness would prove an equal obstacle to his own position being discovered, he resolved upon the hazardous experiment of displaying a light. The quick and emphatic dash of oars which succeeded, met with a response in his fast beating heart. A momentary silence, and the low, cautious interchange of the words Dudley and Rogers, established the certainty of the anxious hopes of each. In a moment more the boats were side by side. A few minutes sufficed to put Dudley in possession of all the important facts in relation to Ellen's situation. It is well known to the historical reader that the allied army, in their hasty departure from the walls of Fort Stanwix, left behind them, not only their artillery and many of their tents, but a large portion of their stores and camp equipage. It was an easy matter for Dudley to procure apparel from these sources, both of the civilized and savage soldier, which might serve as disguise for himself and companions, nor had he neglected so obvious an aid to his enterprise. To transform the Indians by a change of dress, from the republican Oneidas into the royal Mohawks, was no difficult operation, and Dudley, with equal celerity, was converted into a private of Sir John Johnson's regiment of American loyalists. All things being in readiness, the boats slowly and silently approached the shore, taking a direction that would bring them to land a few rods below the camp. As they drew nigh, the sentinels could be distinctly seen and the countersign was carefully impressed upon the mind of each of the party. It required no repetition to the Indians, for the word was “Brant.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER X. Reclining, not sleeping, in her guarded tent, the unfortunate Ellen passed the slow watches of the night in an agony of apprehension. She had heard nothing of Dudley since the day of his departure for Fort Dayton, and fears for his safety formed an item in her distress. She had not even been able to communicate with Rogers since the retreat commenced, although the faithful sergeant had contrived to be allotted to the same boat which conveyed her, and with two Indians and one of his fellow privates, constituted its full company. The vessel which had been selected for Ellen was of a fanciful construction, and had received from Waldon the name of the “gondola.” Waldon, fearful, perhaps, of his captive's reproaches, and knowing the impossibility of her escape, contented himself with occupying the boat next preceding in the line. The stir and bustle without, at length announced to Ellen the approach of day, and the note of preparation for departure fell with dismal forebodings upon her ear. She was immediately in readiness, and although there were yet no signs of light, she pulled aside the canvas door of her tent and looked out. She knew that she was closely guarded, but she was not prepared for the uncivil command which at once forbade her egress. A second speaker, in a voice still more gruff, approached the door, and uttering some well dissembled words of reproof, contrived to slip a paper into her hands and immediately withdrew. By the faint light of a taper, Ellen perused the following words: “Make every possible delay in leaving your tent and embarking. Minutes are worth millions. Be watchful and discreet.” Uttering a hearty ejaculation of thanksgiving for the indefinite hope thus held out to her, she instantly burned the paper, and hastily divesting herself of part of her apparel, retired to bed. By feigning a sleep sound and difficult to dispel, when summoned to arise, by tardiness in dress and many ingenious resources, she succeeded in faithfully obeying the directions of her visitor. The part to be performed by Dudley's party on obtaining entrance into the camp was of the most difficult nature. They were not only to man the boat which was designed for Ellen in their assumed character, but it was necessary in some way to get rid of three of its former crew. Lastly, and almost equally important, was the necessity of delaying its departure, so that it might be in the rear of the whole line. Simultaneous with the first movements in the camp, they proceeded to take possession of the boat; and Rogers, having instructed his disguised companions how to simulate as nearly as possible the deportment of its former occupants, stepped upon the shore to await their approach. Many of the boats were already filled, but Waldon, who had charge of that division of the flotilla, had not yet arrived. As the two Indians who formed part of the gondola's crew approached, Rogers hastened to meet them, and said: “The light is breaking on the hills and the deer are already abroad. There will be gold for him who brings game for the pale faced maiden. Go quickly, and meet us an hour hence by yonder bluff.” The Indians were ready armed, either for war or the chase, and needed no second bidding to so agreeable a task. For his fellow soldier, who soon arrived, the sergeant was prepared with an equally ingenious device. “You complained yesterday,” he said, “of illness and fatigue. Mr. Waldon has sent us another oarsman, and you are to go in either of the large batteaux.” The fellow, unsuspecting, gladly turned away aud joined a crowd who were filling up one of the largest sized boats. It was not until many of the foremost boats had started, that Waldon arrived, accompanied by the trembling Ellen. “I think I will take a seat in your boat this morning, Mr. Rogers,” he said. “Our fair ally here exhibits unusual alarm, and may need my personal attention.” “The gondola draws much water,” was the sergeant's reply, “and rows heavily; but if you choose te take my oar, I can go in one of the batteaux.” “By no means,” said Waldon, laughing, “the day promises to be too warm for that; but keep as near in position as possible, and if anything goes wrong I shall be in easy hailing distance. Hasten now, or we shall be the very last to embark.” He handed Ellen to the boat and was about to depart, but suddenly pointing to one of the Oneidas, he said— “How's this, sir? Have you changed your crew, or who is this broad shouldered savage? A light! quick, bring a light—we have strange visitors here.” Rogers stood with one foot in the boat and one upon the bank, and Waldon, standing upon the shore in a stooping position, was looking into the vessel. Dealing a staggering blow upon the head of Waldon, the sergeant sprang into the boat, and seizing an oar, whispered, “Pull now for your lives.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XI. The movement had been so instantaneous, the noise was so slight, and the blow upon Waldon so stunning, that nearly a minute elapsed before any intelligible alarm was given. Shouts were then heard from the shore, with the dash of oars, and all the signs of quick pursuit. Shots were fired, but the arrowy flight of the boat had already carried it too far into the obscurity that yet rested upon the waters, to admit of a distinct aim. The increasing light soon showed the fugitives that they were pursued by a batteaux containing twelve men, all of whom were Indians but one, who it is scarcely necessary to say, was Waldon. The distance that now separated the vessels was about a quarter of a mile. Their motion was alarmingly accelerated, and the interval between the parties was rapidly diminishing; but the broad shoulders which had once proved so disastrous, were now of essential service. Perceiving the exigency, Wongah, the elder Indian, requested Dudley to surrender his oar to him, and taking the forward pair he bent to his task, like Samson beneath the gates of Gaza. All looked on in amazement, and expected momentarily to see the giant's strength give out; but mile after mile was overcome without the least abatement of D speed. A glad smile of hope and encouragement lit up every countenance, for the distance between the vessels had already more than doubled, notwithstanding the utmost efforts of the enemy. In vain did Dudley implore Wongah to spare his strength, lest it might fail altogether. The quiet smile, the calm, equable breathing, the uniform ponderous motion, told him that there was as little to fear from fatigue in the huge and compact mass of muscles before him, as if it had been some mighty machine of levers, wheels and springs. When Dudley had relinquished his oar to the Indian, his change of position brought him for the first time near to Ellen; but the excitement of the race, and the vigilant oversight now required of him, still prevented him from disclosing himself. Ellen knew nothing of the process by which her rescue was to be attempted, and when she found herself once more seated in the dreaded boat, she gave herself up for lost. The temporary sense of relief now experienced by all, afforded an opportunity to make himself known. The light had fully dawned, and as he seized an opportune moment, and turned with a smile of triumph and affection to Ellen, a speechless surprise, and joy that knew no utterance, pervaded her breast. But a sudden ejaculation from the younger Indian, who was looking westward with an earnest gaze, now attracted attention. Turning, he spoke a few words in his native tongue to his companion, and the latter immediately suspended his labors and gazed intently in the same direction. “What do the Oneidas see, Mr. Rogers?” inquired Dudley, with ill-disguised alarm. Rogers listened a moment to their guttural dialogue, and rising to his feet, looked earnestly across the waters, then turning to the lieutenant, he said in a low voice: “I see nothing myself, but the Lynx says there are two armed canoes turning yonder point, and coming down with the speed of wind.” “Is Wongah frightened?” said Dudley, turning to the Indian, who was yet leaning on his oars; “does he think they can evertake us?” “Wongah does not fear,” was the characteristic reply; “but the hawk is swifter than the heron.” This figurative allusion to the fleetness of the birch canoe, was not misunderstood, and every eye was now strained to catch a glimpse of the new object of alarm. The Indian, meanwhile, had resumed his labors with all his former force, and without the least change of countenance. The canoes were too much in the shade of the shore to be perceptible to unpracticed eyes, but the movement of the batteaux soon furnished additional proof of their approach. She turned suddenly about and hastening to meet her allies, was also soon lost to view in the shadows. The canoes, dancing like corks upon the water, were soon seen to emerge from the obscurity, and seemed like distant sea-birds pluming their wings for flight. They each contained seven men, of whom, as before, all save one were Indians. It was useless to disguise the alarm inspired by this new aspect of affairs; for, although the pursuers were nearly a mile behind, it was apparent to all that their present speed would soon bring them up with the gondola. The latter boat was already taxed to her full capacity, but no human strength could impart to such a vessel the impetus which two pairs of well-plied oars give to a feathery canoe. A hasty consultation was held, at which Rogers and the Lynx proposed running for the shore, and trying to make good their retreat through the forests. Wongah opposed this as fatal, but offered no substitute. He gave his opinion with stoical calmness when called upon, without at all suspending his labors. Dudley spoke last. “It is idle,” he said, “to think of escape through twenty miles of wilderness, with such a pack of blood-hounds on our track. But there is a small island which cannot be many miles distant. Let us gain that, and once under cover we can at least keep the fiends at bay until dark, when some means of relief may possibly be found.” To this proposition, the Indians responded together, with their sententious exclamation, “good.” “So it is good,” said Rogers, energetically, recovering, despite the danger, a portion of his natural humor. “If the red devils can land under our four rifles, they shall be welcome to the scalp of Joe Rogers. Pull away Mr. Lynx, and three cheers for the skipper.” Endeavoring thus to arouse his own failing spirits, those of his companions, the noble hearted sergeant resumed his labors at the oar. The refuge referred to by Dudley, was a small wooded islet, scarcely forty rods in length, which had attracted his attention on the preceding day. It became visible on rounding a small promontory, but still at the distance of several miles. The pursuers seemed immediately to comprehend the design of the fugitives, and the question became at once which party should first reach the island. There was no way to increas; the gondola's speed, and all that remained was patiently to watch the chances. Although the canoes were soon within rifle shot, neither party seemed disposed to resort to fire-arms. Waldon felt too sure of success to risk the life of Ellen unnecessarily, and Dudley's company were all actively employed in the management of their boat. For a third of an hour the most perfect silence was preserved in the gondola, while every nerve of the oarsmen seemed strained to its utmost tension. The eyes of Ellen wandered incessantly from boat to boat, and forward to the island, measuring the rapidly diminishing intervals between each, and resting occasionally upon Dudley's countenance, as if they would read there a solution of her dreadful doubts. At the distance of half a mile from the island, the forward canoe was running nearly abreast of the fugitives, about forty rods distant, and making for the northern extremity of the land. There seemed no longer any hope; but at this critical moment a cracking noise was heard, and one of the oar blades of the parallel boat was seen floating astern. The speed of the canoe was sensibly diminished; Wongah's ponderous blows fell with redoubled rapidity upon the water; the gondola shot ahead, and in three minutes touched the shore.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XII. Dudley's first movement was to place Ellen in a place of safety, and then to find secure shelter for himself and companions, whence they could repel the advance of the enemy. All this was but the work of an instant. The crippled vessel had continued to advance with no slight velocity, for she had still two effective oars; but her consort had taken the land, and for a while had threatened to make at least a simultaneous landing with the gondola. But when her crew had perceived this to be impracticable, they hastened to retire beyond rifle shot, divining with ready sagacity the D* designs of the other party. They were, however, too late to avoid the effect of one leaden messenger from the weapon of the active sergeant; a sharp yell and a sudden commotion in the boat proclaimed its success. Three more shots were instantly fired, but with no observable result. It was far, however, from being the design of the enemy to abandon the pursuit. They felt rather like the sportsman, who, having cornered his game, deliberates only upon the easiest means of dispatching it. At a safe distance the vessels came together in conference, which resulted in one of them making a detour about the island, and taking up a position opposite to the other extremity. This movement made it necessary for Dudley to divide his small force; yet so minute was the territory to be defended, that the two divisions of the garrison were not beyond each other's call. It was now fully expected that the besiegers would attempt a simultaneous landing on the opposite sides—a course which ordinary courage would certainly have prompted; but they evidently designed some less dangerous expedient. To and fro, like sharks waiting for their prey, through the long and tedious hours of the day, the canoes glided leisurely about, maintaining a close watch upon every part of the coast. It was then, doubtless, for the night that the attack was designed, and it was with sad forebodings that the island prisoners watched the sun beginning to decline from the meridian. But they had not been idle. The moment they became convinced that there was no immediate danger, a consultation was again held to devise means of relief; for, as the enemy was discernable from any part of the coast, and the defenders could be easily summoned to the point of attack, they were no longer confined to any one position. But deliberation seemed of no avail. The calm and unclouded sky fore-told a still and star-light night, and one that would render a secret embarkation and flight nearly impossible; and although the same causes would make the landing somewhat hazardous, there could be no longer any doubt that they had determined upon taking the risk. There seemed, indeed, nothing to be done, except to await the invasion and sell their lives as dearly as possible. Although compelled to contemplate this fearful issue of all his efforts, Dudley still strove to encourage Ellen with hopes that he himself could no longer entertain. But new events claimed attention. The younger Indian had long been missing from the council, and on search being made, he was found seated beside a pile of bark, which had been freshly stripped from the birch trees around him, while a quantity of sea weed such as is used by the Indians for thread or cord, was also collected at his side. It was with no small alarm that Dudley and Rogers viewed these preparations, giving indications that their allies were about to desert them. The southern shore was but about two-thirds of a mile distant, and a very small canoe might possibly be constructed before night, capable of transporting one or two persons across, before they could be overtaken from the more remote starting points of the enemy. Dudley hastened to interrogate the Indian as to his designs. “The Lynx is not a rat,” was the calm reply, “to be beaten to death in a trap.” “The Lynx is a coward to desert his friends,” rejoined Dudley, angrily. “What does Wongah say?” “Wongah will stay,” was the quick reply. The Lieutenant grasped the hand of the Indian with emotion, and by that gesture, and by a grateful look alone, expressed his thanks. Scorning to expostulate with the other, he was about to turn contemptuously away, when the low, soft voice of the youth was heard. Dudley turned to listen, but the words were addressed to Wongah, and being in the Oneida tongue, were too rapidly uttered to admit of his comprehending the meaning. He saw, however, that a smile of merriment was on the face of the young Indian, and that his whole countenance was lit up with a look of ingenuousness and fidelity that could not be mistaken. Wongah slowly repeated the substance of the words to Dudley in broken English, and the latter, with extended hands rushed to his young ally, and having begged pardon for his late unworthy suspicions, sat down to assist him at his task. Wongah also lent his aid, and the work went rapidly forward. The Lynx, like many of his race, had a spice of humor in his composition, that no danger could wholly suppress.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XIII. To construct a canoe of any considerable burthen or capacity in so short a time, and under so many disadvantages, was of course impossible. To make a frail machine for the purpose of strategy yet capable of attaining some temporary speed, although a far easier undertaking, still required no small amount of labor. The sun went down before the task was completed, although all hands mere employed upon it, not excepting those of the gentle Ellen. If falling tears could have cemented the bark, the work would have been soon done. The project which engrossed such general attention will be best described by the history of its progress. When the boat was completed, even to its rude but effective oars, the ingenuity of the Indians was yet to be more fully displayed. Effigies of every individual of the company, excepting the Lynx, were immediately formed, and with a fidelity both astonishing and ludicrous. The hats and upper garments of the men, and the bonnet and shawl of Ellen were of course made use of, while the absent bodies were supplied by sticks and branches of trees, artfully arranged. The slight and erect form of Dudley, the graceful bust of Ellen, the short and robust sergeant, and the broad shouldered Wongah, with his scant mantle, were all there, and with a celerity of construction that seemed the work of magic. In this boat, with these imaginary companions the Lynx was to start for the southern shore, with a view to entice the enemy to a distance from the island. If he were successful in this artifice, the remainder of the party were at once to embark in the gondola, and hoped to obtain a sufficient start before the ruse was discovered, to effect their escape. The Indian, when he gained the shore, if he succeeded in doing so, would make the best of his way through the wilderness to the fort. Where the general hazard was so imminent, it was useless, perhaps, to calculate degrees of danger; yet none could refrain from feeling as if an extraordinary peril was devolved upon the generous savage. The chance of his being overtaken before he could reach the shore, was so great, that it seemed as if he was devoting himself to immediate death for his associates. He manifested, however, not the least fear, and made all his preparations with a coolness that displayed the utmost presence of mind. “The Mohawks will chase shadows,” he said, with a low laugh; “their braves will shoot at blankets.” Rogers with well meant, but needless assiduity, cautioned him as to his trail in the forest, if he was so fortunate as to reach it, reminding him that a detachment of the enemy might follow him there. The Indian looked scornfully as he replied: “Let them track the swallows; the Lynx leaves no trail.” The night proved, as had been anticipated, still and starlight; and when the last ray of twilight had disappeared, the boat with its phantom crew was silently launched, ready for departure on the very first movement of the foe. The gondola, in the mean time, had been transported across the island to the northeastern shore, and was also in readiness. They had not long to wait. Recumbent on the beach, his eyes brought nearly on a level with the horizon, the Lynx himself was the first to detect the motionof the enemy. Lingering for a few minutes, that he might make it more certain of being discovered, he jumped into his boat, and pulled quickly for the shore. The flight of the prisoners being anticipated, he was, of course, almost instantly perceived. A long, shrill yell announced the discovery from one boat to the other, and the race immediately commenced. But although trembling and anxious for the fate of their companion, the remainder of the party had but little time to watch the chase. The moment that the changed position of the enemy seemed to render it safe, they also embarked, and at first taking a northerly direction until they had obtained a considerable offing, they changed their course and pulied rapidly down the Lake. The race was for life, and the exertion was proportionate. Not a word was spoken. All felt conscious that in a very short time the ruse would be discovered. The distance to the eastern extremity of the Lake was about eight miles, and from that point to the fort, about fifteen. Although this latter course could be chiefly accomplished by means of the inlet, the navigation of that stream was difficult, and would give a vast advantage to the pursuers. A route through the forest was therefore resolved upon, from some point near the head of the Lake, if they should succeed in safely reaching that point. About ten minutes had elapsed in silence, when a loud and prolonged yell of many voices was heard from the direction of the enemy. The oarsmen paused to listen, and a momentary shudder pervaded every breast, as the probable fate of their companion was contemplated. `'T is the scalp haloo of the Mohawks,” said Rogers, solemnly; “our friend is dead.” All turned to Wongah for his opinion; but the Indian, with one finger raised to enjoin silence, still remained listening. At that moment, the well-known war-cry of the Oneidas rang in one long, shrill note across the silent waters, waking the slumbering echoes with the sound. “The Lynx is safe!” said the old man, as he again bent energetically to his task. A single shot was all the additional noise that was heard, and they now knew that the foe was in swift pursuit of themselves. The succeeding hour, fleet-winged as it may have been to some, was a long age of suspense to the fugitives. Keeping close to the land, they held their course with unabated speed, until at length the converging shores announced that they were near their intended place of debarkation. But hope seemed only to tantalize and mock them; for at this moment, a fiendish shout from the enemy announced that they were again discovered. The stout heart of Dudley, the merry sergeant, and even the stoical Wongah, seemed now to despair, while the terrified and exhausted Ellen fell senseless in the boat. They did, indeed, hasten toward the land, but it was with no well-defined hope of either defense or escape. Bloodhounds might possibly have been eluded, but to elude the pursuit of a dozen Mohawks through such a wilderness, was impossible. While Dudley and Rogers lifted the lifeless form of Ellen from the vessel, another wild yell reached their ears, and the enemy were distinctly seen making for the shore at a point about sixty rods below. Still bearing their beautiful burden, the young men hastened up the bank and rushed wildly and aimlessly through the woods. But an unseen hand was guiding their steps. The rattling of a bayonet and the quick sharp call of a sentinel announced, what the next moment's glance confirmed, that they were within the limits of a military encampment. Stunned by the sudden reaction of his feelings, Dudley scarcely found words to announce his name and rank; having done which, he demanded to be conducted forth-with to the commander's tent. He knew that he was in an American camp, but was scarcely prepared for so great a delight as finding himself in the immediate presence of Col. Willett, who was on his return from a pursuit of St. Leger. It was yet early in the night, and the officers had not retired to rest. Having hastily given information of the approach of his pursuers, orders were instantly given for extinguishing the light of the camp and calling in the sentinels. Three detachments of fifty men each were detailed to take up positions, with short intervals between, stretching transversely from the shore. The utmost silence was preserved, and Waldon and the Mohawks rushed heedlessly into the trap. Their first notice of danger was the command to fire, and simultaneous with the sound, eight of the band, including their vindictive and treacherous leader, lay stretched upon the ground. The remainder with one or two exceptions, were taken prisoners. On Dudley the more agreeable task had devolved of restoring Ellen to animation, and of witnessing the first overpowering sense of delight which the knowledge of their strange fortunes created. How amply his own perils and privations were repaid by the fruition of that affection which only woman's heart can bestow, need scarcely be said. On the ensuing day, Col. Willett returned with his detachment to the fort, where the Lynx had already safely arrived. He related with much minuteness the cautious approach of his pursuers to his deserted vessel upon the shore, and their successful capture of its non-combatant crew, concluding by asserting with grave irony that the “Mohawks were great warriors.” Himself and the aged Wongah, like most of the Oneidas, ever continued faithful to the republican cause, and lived to receive many proofs of the gratitude of Dudley and Ellen. The tide of war during the remaining period of the revolution, rolled chiefly in a direction remote from the county of Tryon, but neither Dudley or Rogers were sufficiently enamoured of martial glory to follow its retiring banners. Yet in those minor, but sanguinary struggles, which long convulsed the beautiful valley of the Mohawk, they were its most valient defenders, and received the rich mead of their country's approbation, and the still richer reward of an approving conscience.</field>
