      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER I. Our story opens in the harbor and town of Newport in the “Old Colony Days.” At the period in which we shall lay the scenes of our romance, this town was second in New England only to Boston in wealth and commercial importance. Its trade was far more extensive than it is at the present day, and was mainly carried on with the West Indies and Spain, with its dependencies, in vessels of all classes from the shallop of twenty tons to the imposing merchant-ship. Its merchants were enterprising and intelligent, and rivalled those of Boston in the opulence of their style of living and show of state. They dressed in velvet on holidays and Sundays, and in their counting-rooms wore ruffles of lace and powdered curls. Although Newport did not then exhibit as many beautiful villas about it as it now does, it nevertheless contained substantial mansions which were the abodes of refinement and intelligence. Its harbor was then as beautiful as now, with perhaps more woodland crossing its shores and darkening its surrounding uplands. The small island opposite the town was then overgrown with a noble grove with one or two humble tenements visible near its eastern and southern shore, the dwellings of fishermen or boatmen; and on several points on the main-land, where now the hills appear open and bleak, grew thick copses of dark pine and larch. But the town itself was as compact and nearly as large as it is now; and its wharves as numerous; and wearing an aspect of commercial thrift they have scarcely exhibited since. The times into which we are about to carry back the reader, were full of excitement touching the revenue laws which Great Britain's fatal obstinancy persevered in fastening upon the commerce of her colonies. In vain did the colonists by protestations, by petitions, by remonstrances, and finally by non-importation, urge the removal of this obnoxious usurpation of the power of the mother country. In vain did the Massachusetts men assembled in council, declare, “We know no Commissioners of His Majesty's customs, nor of any revenue His Majesty has a right to establish in North America.” The ministry exerted their power to compel the colonists to submission, and sent over armed vessels to protect the commissioners of her customs in the exercise of their authority. Upon this the merchants of the colonies resolved to import goods in defiance of the laws of revenue and trade; and smuggling became in the eyes of every patriotic American a virtue! In Boston, vessels, when arrived, were taken possession of by parties of citizens, and their cargoes discharged in the very face of the intimidated officers; and hundreds of men stood around to protect the workers while engaged in landing the cargo. Everywhere the spirit of indignant resistance, (which for years afterwards, in 1776, broke out into open rebellion and revolution) was aroused, and the most determined opposition to the unjust revenue imposed by the crown, was resolved upon by all men, from the highest to the lowest. The merchants of Newport had shown a very prominent determination to set at defiance these laws of the British ministry, and the most eminent of them who were engaged in the foreign and West India trade secretly held a meeting at the house of one of their number, at which they passed resolutions, declaring “that the laws of revenue imposed by the crown, being unjust and tyrannical, should be resisted by every free man.” The day after the passage of this spirited resolution, the citizens of Newport were not a little surprised at the sight of a British ship-of-war coming up the bay and dropping anchor within a mile of the town. That the meeting and decision of the merchants had not brought her there so promptly, was very clear; and all men saw in her presence there a determination on the part of he crown to protect its commissioners in the exercise of their duties. Nevertheless the officers of the sloop-of war, when they came on shore, were treated with hospitality and courtesy by the authorities of the town. It was towards the close of the afternoon of the day on which the British ship-of-war arrived, that two individuals were seen standing upon a low eminence south of the town, from which the armed sloop was in full sight. One of these persons, was a man full fifty years of age, but with the hardy frame, and sun-burned visage of an old seaman, though his dress was of the land, consisting of a well-worn blue coat, with broad skirts, a flapped brown vest, and knee-breeches fastened with paste buckles. His hat was, however, a seaman's glazed chapeau. He wore at his side, hanging from a leathern belt, a straight sword with a rusty iron handle. His head was grizzled, and also his whiskers, which were immensely large covering half his cheeks and chin. In height he was far from being a tall man, but his shoulders were broad and square, and he was built like a man of great strength. He carried beneath his arm a small spy glass, and when he was not pacing up and down the green mossy rock on which the signal-staff stood, he was looking down the bay with his glass at his eye. The other person was a female. She was coarsely dressed in a faded chintz frock that had once been very gay, and wore a man's hat with a broad brim; about her shoulders was drawn a scarf that had doubtless once graced the form of some one of the fair daughters of the wealthy colonists, but which had now lost all its richness, save the costliness of its texture. She had on a pair of worked Indian moccasins, and in her ears and about her neck were ornaments of gold beads. She was about eight-and-thirty years of age, with a bold and still handsome profile, and a dark Egyptian skin. Her eyes were large and lustrous and seemed to burn with their own fire. By her, upon the ground, lay a stout staff, crooked at the end, with a serpent's head carved upon it. She was seated upon a large stone a few feet from the flag-staff, her elbows resting upon her knees and her chin supported in the hollow formed by her two hands. She kept her eyes fixedly, and with a stern compression of the mouth upon the sloop-of-war, which was at anchor directly opposite the height. In her whole appearance there was something wild and unusual. The man who paced to and fro, occasionally glanced at her, as if familiar with her presence, but she paid no attention to him or anything but the British ship. She had approached him from the town about a quarter of an hour before, as he was looking through his glass down the bay, and without saying a word had seated herself upon a rock and fixed her immovable gaze upon the ship. At length she began to mutter in an under tone, when the man with the spy-glass, after watching her with something like superstitious awe in his looks, said, “Well, Margaret, what is the matter? Don't you like the cut o' the sloop's jib, hey?” “Don't disturb me,” answered the female, impatiently. “Don't disturb me, I say. I am putting every soul on 'em under the evil spell. They will do no mischief after I have looked at 'em and prayed at 'em till the sun goes down.” “It is two bells yet to sun-down, Maggy,” said the man. “You'll get tired cursing 'em.” “I love my country too well to get tired serving it, mate Finch. Many's the night I've watched under the stars and prayed for the colony and cursed the crown! Don't disturb me now. I must put this ship under the spell. Soon as I heard that the British ministry had sent us a ship, I prepared my herbs and medicaments, my silver dust and holy water, my fire and incense, and made up a curse for her; and now I have come here to put it on her and hers; on her hull and on her spars, on her rigging and on her sails, on her captain and her crew, on her keel and on her deck, and on all without and within. So let me alone that I may curse her ere the blessed sun goes down.” And she shook her head fiercely and impatiently, and settled herself more firmly to her work, bending her eyes, that were as bright as the eyes of a serpent, on the vessel before her. The man stood regarding her for a few seconds, with a smile of pity mixed with fear, and then murmuring, “poor Mag,” raised his spy-glass to his eye and levelled it at some object down the bay which seemed suddenly to have caught his eye. “By the king and parliament, it is a craft of some sort coming in. Now if it should be the old gentleman's brig, there'll be a squall here in Newport afore twenty-four hours goes over it.” “A squall,” repeated the woman, turning her head at his words and as if forgetful of her other purpose, proceeded violently, “you may say a squall, but I say a tempest. Not in Newport, tomorrow, but ere long throughout the length and breadth of the land. God is with us, mate. God is against them, mate! A tempest, I say, menaces the British throne. Ah, send your armed ships!” she cried, rising up and stretching her hands towards the sloop and shaking her fingers, while an expression of withering scorn and contempt mould ed the features of a face that had once been beautiful. “Send your cannon and your troopers, proud king of the Isles, but we will laugh you to scorn.— We will mock your power and despise your arms. God is with us and against thee. What dost thou see? Nay, I have eyes that need no aid. It is a schooner and an enemy's schooner!” she said, catching with her bright glance the distant sail. “Nay, dame, thou canst not tell at this distance with the naked eye what I can hardly make out with a glass.” “Who made that glass?” “It was made in Paris.” “It was made by some man?” “Yes, of course.” “God's works are better than man's. God made my eyes. I tell you, believe me when I speak, I deceive no one. I say the craft is an armed schooner and a foe.” “I don't see how you make it out; but I see now she is a schooner and not a brig! I sometimes have thought, Maggy, that you deal with the old one.” “As if Sathana had power to make me see what my own eyes could not see! as if he was greater than all. But I see with my understanding. I can comprehend with my senses, which are greater than the eye or the ear, that are only the servants of the senses. I know that the schooner is an enemy—that she carries George's flag at her mast head.” “Well, if turns out to be so, I shall be afraid of you, Maggy. If you know so much how is it you don't know what has become of your boy?” “My boy! my Harry!” she almost shrieked, while her face became deadly pale, and she clasped her hands firmly across her heart as if compressing it with all her strength. “Why do you speak of him? oh, why do you name him whom I shall never see more? It is this that hath crazed my poor brain. It is my boy—my darling, handsome, noble boy. Oh talk not of him. Let me not think of him, save when I am on the sea side, and the waves roll and the winds roar, and the rocks echo, and I can shout and let my madness keep time with the madness around me! But not here! not in this still summer day, with the sum shining and the birds singing and all so peaceful—oh, speak not of him. I shall go mad.” “I am sorry, Margaret,” said the man, looking fearful, and his face expressing the deepest commisseration.— “It was a thoughtless question. I ought to ha' know'd better, coz I knew how it was when he was mentioned.” “Hist! Silence! Hush!” she gasped with a deep painful suspiration between each word, while she rapidly walked round and round in a circle, her hands clasping her heart. Suddenly she stood still and smiled with terrible vindictiveness, while she shook her finger at the British ship: “Oh, murderers of my boy! Oh, ye have yet to give him up to the bar of God. Ye tore him from me! ye wrested him from my arms! ye robbed me of my noble one. But it shall not prosper with you. The curse is upon you, proud ships of Britain. For my boy's sake, ill shall befal you. My prayers have armed the winds and sharpened the lightnings of heaven against ye.” “Be calm, mother,” said the man, gently. “Well, I will be calm. I will say no more. But you should not have asked me about my boy. It makes me mad. But let me prophesy to you, mate Finch. The day is not far distant when the glory of England shall be humbled before the power of this colony, and for al this oppression we shall be avenged seven-fold. Let their ships with their bloody flag come and anchor before our towns; the day will come when they will leave their anchors and fly like cowards before the might and majesty of a free people.” “I hope you speak the truth, Margaret, but I fear it will be worse afore its better,” said the man. “I do really believe you are right, and that is an armed schooner up the bay,” he added, with his glass once more at his eye.— “Well, I shall really begin to think you are what folks say you be.” He looked round as he spoke, but she had disappeared around a projecting rock, and gone in the direction of a hut near the water.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER II. The man stood for some time closely watching the distant sail after the departure of the female, and having one eye shut and the other at the lens of the telescope, he did not observe the approach of two persons, the sound of their footsteps being broken by the thick moss with which the rock was covered. One of them was an elderly gentleman, the other an extremely beautiful young girl of seventeen, who was hanging upon his arm. They were approaching by the path which led from the town, which was but a short walk from the height, being indeed so nigh that one could distinguish and recognise persons walking in the streets. The gentleman was about forty-seven years of age, tall and commanding in his person, and with that indescribable air of high-bred courtesy which marks the man by fortune and condition. His dress also evinced, but less strongly, his position in society, for money can purchase the garb but not the mind of a true gentleman. He wore a very elegant coat of purple velvet, with silver lace at the cuffs, a white waistcoat with silver buttons, and small clothes of drab cassimere, while at his knees and in his polished shoes sparkled jet buckles. His neatly plaited ruffle that amply filled his bosom, his snow-white stockings and spotless cravat, evinced a man of neat and precise habits, though all well-bred persons of that day studied more precision in dress than those of modern times. His hair was powdered and a queue wound with black silk hung down over his collar. He wore a chapeau, laced and sparkling with the diamond button that looped up its front. He wore no sword, but carried in his grasp a stout bamboo stick ornamented with a gold top. The expression of his face, which was very noble in the outline, was that of mingled firmness and benevolence, combined with worldly sagacity. He was in conversation with the maiden, and a smile of affection, which played upon his face whenever he spoke, showed that she was dearer and nearer to him than a mere acquaintance. This the character of her face gave clear evidence of; for she had the same clear, hazel eye and intelligent looking brow that characterized his countenance, and there was a likeness to his smile in hers. Those features of resemblance were, however, refined and spiritualized in her, for she was surpassingly lovely. Her complexion was unusually brilliant, a beauty for which the ladies of Newport are at this day remarkable, and her fine eyes were animated with intelligence, and cheerfulness shone like sunny all over her light bright, joyous face. Her figure, as she slightly leaned with unstudied grace upon her father's arm, for such was the near relation in which he stood to her, displayed the most exquisite symmetry just developing into the blooming tournure of womanly proportion. They had been walking on slowly, enjoying and remarking upon the beauty of the harbor and bay under the pleasant evening sun, and occasionally stopping to enjoy some new and interesting aspect under which the scenery, familiar as it was to them, presented itself; for never does the same scene offer the same appearance twice to the eye of the tasteful observer. It is even modified by the state of the atmosphere, of the heavens, of the wind, and even the feelings of the spectator. No landscape looks the same in the afternoon and in the morning; nor if there be water and a breeze, in a wind and in a still day. A cloud passing over the sun will change its character for the moment, and clouds hanging upon the horizon often serve for the time, instead of a range of mountains, to terminate a level prospect. The glory and beauty of nature is forever varying, and the eye of taste never wearies in gazing on he most familiar scenes. Thus it was, that although Barbara Frankland had been conversant with the landscape around her from very childhood, and had walked to the signal hill a thousand times alone, for she dwelt not far distant, she every few moments would stop to draw her father's attention to some new and beautiful feature of the scene around her. The British sloop-of-war which had anchored in the harbor in the morning, was also an object of deep interest to them both, and came in for its share of attention; but when Mr. Frankland, on gaining the top of the acclivity, saw the mate with the glass at his eye and beheld the said down the bay, he quickened his pace, dropping his daughter's arm, saying: “There is something coming in! I must see what master Finch has made of it.” The man was so busily occupied in trying to make out the stranger, that the new comer was close by his side and had laid his hand lightly on his arm before he discovered his presence. “Oh, your sarvant, sir, I begs pardon! and good day, miss!” he said, bowing sailor-fashion, with great respect to the merchant, for such he was, and with a more than usual degree of nautical grace to the maiden, who had stopped a few feet off and was engaged in looking admiringly about her from the commanding eminence which she had reached. She smiled and nodded pleasantly at his salutation, while her father said eagerly, “What do you discover, master Finch? What, is she coming up? Is it the brig?” “No, sir,” responded the mate, as he touched his hat and handed to him the spy-glass. “She is an armed schooner I think, sir, by her rakish and taunt looks and the squareness of her top-sail. But look for yourself, sir.” “Yes, I think you are right. She is very plainly a schooner, but what can she be? Are we to have more war-vessels up here, forsooth?” added the merchant with a slight flash of angry surprise upon his cheek. “Do you see her, Bab?” he said, addressing his daughter, whose attention was drawn to the vessel by their words. “Take the spy-glass. It is an armed vessel, Finch says.” “And mad Margaret says that it is an English cruiser, miss,” said Finch, “and I believe she is right, for she told me it was a vessel-of-war before I made that out with the glass! She has better eyes than most folks, or she sees like a witch.” “When did you see Margaret?” asked the young girl with some animation, upon hearing the name of the woman mentioned. “Not ten minutes agone, miss. I was here keeping watch, as his honor bade me do, to give him the first notice when this brig hove in sight, when Mag comes and anchors herself on that stone there, and amuses herself with cursing the sloop-of-war there.” “Poor woman!” said the merchant, “she has good cause for wishing evil to the British ships.” “Where is she, good master Finch?” asked Barbara Frankland. “Well, that would be as difficult as to tell which way the wind would blow next Friday week. But I think she steered for her house under the hill there by the cove.” “Well, father, I believe I will walk down and see Margaret, while you and master Finch are watching the approaching vessel.” “Don't be long, child,” answered the merchant, “and here, give this piece. She may stand in need of more comtorts than she has.” “Thanks, father, I will place the money in her hands and say you sent it,” answered the maiden, taking from him a Spanish coin of considerable value. “And she will send good winds and fair after your ships, sir,” said the mate, with the looks of one who believed she could do as he said, “I would rather have Maggy's good will than her ill-favor.” “Art thou so simple-minded, master Finch, as to believe she hath power over the winds?” asked the merchant with a look of grave reproof. “Certainly, he does, dear father,” said the young girl, laughing. “All sailors believe in the supernatural. I dare say master Finch has full faith in aunt Margaret's spells.” “And some young ladies, too, I suspect,” answered Finch, “for I've seen you go to her hut more than once, miss.” “I go to see if she is in want of nothing to render her solitary life comfortable,” responded Barbara, though she blushed as if there was more in the old seaman's words than she cared to confess to him, and as if conscious of her embarrassed air, she turned away, saying gaily as she hastened along the path the other had taken, “But perhaps I am now going there to get my fortune told, who knows, master Finch?” “It's more likely than not,” he answered as she disappeared. “The truth is, your honor,” he added, addressing her father, “the truth is there is more superstition in a pretty lass like Miss Barbara, begging your honor's pardon, than in the oldest salt as ever sarved in a man-of-war. They believe if mad Maggy turns up a tea-cup, she can tell them what consort they'll cruise alongside of all their life. Now, I wouldn't be afeared to guess that Miss Barbara, from the look of her eye, has something more to say to Maggy than to ask her if she is comfortable. There's some witch business, be sure, your honor.” “Well no harm can come of it, Finch. The poor woman can do no one either injury or good.” “I a'nt so sure of that, your honor Things ha' been said about her as looks strange to be said o' any honest Christian body, not but Maggy is honest and Christian enough, for she prays like a parson, and never takes pay for it, and loves the sailor, too. I never minded much what folks said about her, but when I see what she did a bit ago, here, I was a little put aback, and thought she knew even more nor folks said she did.” “Why, what did she do, Finch?” asked the merchant, who had turned his glass from the approaching vessel and was now levelling it steadily and with earnest curiosity at the sloop-of-war anchored in the stream. “Why, she said positive, that the schooner was a war-schooner afore I could make it out to be so with the spy-glass, which shows confounded long seeing for nat'ral eyes, and then she talked so strange about its standing to reason that eyes as God made is better than telescopes as man makes; just as if she could see for all the world as far as a spyglass! And I believe on my soul she can, your honor! I never was afraid of her till then! And if this craft turns out to be an old country cruiser, I shall set her down for a witch. What is it your honor sees in the sloop?” “I was merely looking at her. She is a fine vessel, methinks.” “One of the crack sloops in the King's navy, your honor. It is the same one that was chased by two Dutch frigates and a corvette last year, and out-sailing the frigates, turned upon and captured the corvette in sight of 'em. She sails well and fights well.” “I would rather she had sailed slower and been taken by the Dutchman than be here at anchor, master Finch. I fear she will give us trouble.” “She looks quiet enough now, your honor. What do you suppose she is in here for? To press men, I dare say.” “She will no doubt press any men that come in her way; but this is not her business. She has come to see that we Newport merchants obey the new revenue laws and enter all our cargoes at the king's custom house.” “That is, she means to see that the broad arrow is put on everything that is landed, is that it, your honor?” “Yes. But the king has no right to enforce duties on wines and molasses, nor indeed to enforce any revenue such as he has resolved to impose on us, and we intend to resist the authority of his unjust laws.” “In the face of the sloop there, your honor! no, no,” said the old man shaking his head. “There is too much round iron and powder in her.” “We fear neither her iron nor her powder, master Finch. I shall land my cargo of wines and molasses as soon as the brig arrives, in defiance of the revenue. I shall not pay a thousand pounds into the king's treasury for the privilege of landing my own property; and he who attemps to rob me of my goods in the shape of duties is a robber, and shall be treated as such.” “But, your honor, you will not resist the king's new custom house officers, if they come on board?” “I don't mean they shall come on board. I expect my brig, “the Free-Trader,” in with this wind, and to give me timely notice of her approach, I have, as you know, set you on the watch here, so that when she comes within signal distance, I can telegraph her to stand out again until night and then run in, when I will board her before she comes to anchor, and have her up at my wharf and her freight out of her before daybreak.” “It will be a dangerous business for us, your honor. If the sloop wasn't here, it might be done, for the custom-house men are but few, but it will be risky business now; and here comes this schooner, too, to make it more so.” “I have made up my mind what I will do, and nothing will alter my determination,” said the American merchant firmly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER III. The Colonial merchant, whom we have introduced to the reader in the foregoing chapter, was the leading rich man of the town of Newport. He had been in earlier years a crown-officer and secretary to the king's governor; but subsequently he engaged in commerce, and at the period of our story he was one of the most opulent of the New England merchants, and exercised a wide influence, both on account of his intelligence and wealth, over the minds of those who came in contact with him. In the oppressive measures of the mother country towards her colonies, he had long since beheld the germs of a serious quarrel between them: for he well knew the haughty pride of England would never yield its power, and that the firm spirit of resistance to oppression on the part of his colonial countrymen would never bend itself to tyranny. He had written to British ministers, warning them of the danger they were in of exciting rebellion in the colonies, and calmly remonstrating with them; but in vain. The British ministers laughed at the idea of a colony, without an army and without a single armed vessel, daring to defy or resist the laws of so formidable a power as Great Britain; and, as if desirous of testing the experiment, they pushed the colonies to the utmost limits of forbearance. Then it was that the spirit of the American people was roused as the spirit of one man! The leading men in the chief towns corresponded with each other, and consulted upon the perilous condition in which stood the liberties of the colonies. Then it was that Samuel Adams went out from Boston, and visited the most influential persons in the Bay Colony and the adjacent ones, and felt the pulses of men's hearts. In his tour he came to Newport and was a guest of Paul Frankland, who suggested the formation of secret societies of resistance to the oppression of the Crown. These societies, the first of which was held in the library of the rich merchant's mansion, under the name of “The Sons of Liberty,” in a few weeks were established all through New England; and their influence was dally extending, and their numbers becoming more formidable, at the time the chapters of this romance are opened. Paul Frankland was a widower with an only daughter, Barbara, or “The Heiress,” as she was universally designated on account of the immense wealth of her father. He loved her with the most devoted affection; and, although he indulged her in every wish of her heart, she was naturally so good and generous, and was blended with such wisdom and discretion that she was unspoiled either by his lovish fondness or the flattery of those who were around her. She loved to be the instrument of happiness to the needy, and her purse was always open to the poor; so that it was well and truly said of her, “that while Barbara Frankland lived there would be no more poor in Newport. The meeting of the merchants, which has already been alluded to as having taken place the evening preceding the appearance of the English war-ship in the harbor, had been called together by Paul Frankland at his own house; for he had three vessels at sea which were daily expected in, each of which was laden with cargo that was dutiable under the new revenue law; and as men talked much about what he would be likely to do, he therefore resolved to assemble the merchants at his own house, that some rule of action for all might be laid down. At this meeting the resolution was passed which we have already quoted, and he was the first to subscribe his name to it. “Now, gentlemen,” he said smiling, as the last merchant of the company signed the paper, “now we are committed!” “And you will be likely to have your resolution first tested, Mr. Frankland,” said one of the gentlemen, “as you are hourly expecting a ship in!” “Yes, and I shall not flinch from my duty, either to myself or my country. If we submit to this, gentleman, the crown will next tax our windows and chimney flues, as is done in England, and, 'fore God! our wives and children. Our only safety against farther tyranny is firm resistance to the present. If we submit to the yoke to-day, to-morrow they will harness us into the van and make us draw. If they can't bit us, they can't ride us. We must, therefore, resist the bit!” “Suppose that one of your vessels should arrive to-morrow, sir,” remarked one of the merchants, who soon expected in a schooner laden with wine from Madeira, “would you have her hauled up to your whart and discharged, even if the commissioners were on board?” “I should take care not to let them on board; but if they got there, I would treat them civilly so long as they re mained quiet; but if they attempted to stop the unloading, I should feel it my duty to take their swords away and put them on shore!” “And we should have a king's ship here in a week after,” said one of the gentlemen. “The rest of our conduct we have nothing to do with,” answered the fearless merchant. “It is my duty to have my cargo loaded free of duty, and I shall see it done, though the whole English fleet anchored the next day in Newport harbor!” Little did Mr. Frankland anticipate that ere sixteen hours had passed a twenty gun ship would actually drop anchor opposite the town; and when he saw her and understood from the officers that landed, that her business there was to protect the revence officers, he did not abate in his resolution to land his own cargoes free of duty if it could be done. But the other merchants, on seeing the sloop-of-war, began to feel somewhat intimidated; and to question the propriety of resisting, in the face of so formidable a force. Two of the most influential among them, who had been of the company at his house on the previous evening, even waited upon him and recommended that in case any one of his vessels should arrive while the vessel of war was in port, he should suffer his goods to be stored by the commissioners, rather than create a serious quarrel with the crown officers. “If you store them and let them-remain until you can write to England, protesting against the duties,” said one of the gentlemen, “it may prevent bloodshed.” “It will do no good to write and protest. If I store them I shall have to pay the duties, ere I can take them out,” answered Mr. Frankland, firmly. “No, gentlemen, we must be resolved and uncompromising. I expect that this wind will bring in “The Free-Trader,” for she has been a week due, and be assured that on her arrival, I will test the authority of the crown to plunder duties upon her cargo! I have already sent Master Finch, who used to sail in my employ, to the signal-station to keep a look-out for her all day. If he sees her, he is to let me know and I shall signalize her to stand off till night, and to run in under cover of the darkness as far as Indian Rock, when I shall board her and bring her in to the wharf.” “You are very bold, sir! I hope the best; but I fear you will lose your brig and forfeit your liberty,” said the timid townsman. “Be it so,” responded the merchant, in a resolute tone; “I am willing that my case should establish the precedent for all that follows. I am ready, If I have a vessel arrive first, to test in my own person and goods whether an American citizen is to be imprisoned for resisting an unjust law. If the country demands a mortgage, I am prepared to sacrifice myself! I repeat, sir, I will not give one cent to the crown for revenue under the existing law!” The courageous and patriotic merchant then attired himself to appear a a dinner-party given by the King's Commissioner to the captain and officers of the sloop-of-war; for as yet the merchants and the crown officers had not yet come into hostile collision; and the usual courtesies of citizens passed between them. Indeed, the Chief Commissioner was, like Mr. Frankland, a native of Newport, and had received the appointment from the crown for his strong attachment to the ministry, an attachment which, about this time, began to be designated by the term toryism. Between Mr. Pitt Riverton, the head-commissioner, and Mr. Frankland there had existed, even up to this time, the most friendly intercourse, as well, also, with the other officers of the customs, who were appointed from citizens of Newport. The merchant had openly declared to Mr. Riverton, on hearing that he had been commissioned to collect the obnoxious revenue, that he should resist his authority. As this was spoken with a smile, the crown-officer paid little regard to it, though he well knew how unpopular the law as well as his office was to the commercial community. Nevertheless, hearing the next day a good deal of bitterness of language touching the new law, he had thought it best to strengthen his authority; and for this purpose had despatched a messenger to New London for the sloop-of-war, which, a few days afterwards, had so unexpectedly appeared in the harbor. The meeting held in Mr. Frankland's library was kept secret from the commissioners; and willing to conciliate the principal merchants, he had invited them to a dinner which he gave the officers of the ship. Mr. Frankland attended, and had an opportunity of coming into friendly (externally so) intercourse with persons whom he looked upon as his country's oppressors. But his hostility did not fasten itself upon the mere agents of the crown, but upon the ministry itself; and in his heart he felt that he could not blame the officers of the armed ship, though he did the commissioners for the part they were taking in the execution of the evil laws. The subject of the revenue was carefully kept under in the conversation at the table, each party willing to keep quiet upon a theme on which it was well known existed a grave difference of opinion. But the length to which the merchants of the town had gone in having held a secret meeting, and in passing resolutions of non-submission, were not suspected either by Mr. Riverton or the captain of the sloop. The dinner passed off well, though not without a certain degree of restraint; and soon after returning from the commissioner's mansion, Mr. Frankland hastened to his own house to learn if there was any intelligence from the signal-station. Then he was told by his daughter, whom he had left to keep watch from her window upon the hill occupied by the mate, that no flag had yet been hoisted by him. “We will walk up there, Bab,” he said; “the afternoon invites to exercise, and perhaps we may discover some vessels either coming in or going out.” “I never refuse a walk, father, especially on the signal-hill,” she answered; “and, besides, I was wishing to walk that way, for, I—I have—” Here the maiden blushed, and laughed, and added—“ It is no matter. I will walk with you, dear father.” And in a few moments she was ready, with hat and shawl, and accompanied him towards the hill. The residence of Mr. Frankland was one of the most imposing in the town; and, situated on the south side of it, was an extensive garden which reached nearly to the foot of the eminence; while in front of the house, between it and the town, was a wide lawn and flower-garden very elegantly kept. They passed out of the house by a door which led upon a gallery, from which a flight of stairs descended into the garden walks. Crossing it by a shady avenue, they left it by a gate at the farther end, which conducted them to the open hill-side. Here a path wound its way up the declivity to the flag-staff, and by it they soon reached the eminence. The armed schooner now continued rapidly to make her way up the bay, before a fair wind, and, as she got nigher, she hoisted her colors. “English, by the lord Harry!” cried the mate, as he saw the dark-red ensign blow broadly out upon the breeze. “The woman is a witch!” “If she was able to see that the schooner was a vessel of war, Master Finch, it was easy to guess her flag,” said the merchant; “for we have none but English armed cruisers in our waters in these days.” “That is true, your honor; but I believe Maggy is more of a witch than a Christian woman.” “She has no knowledge of witchcraft, that poor woman, be assured, good mate Finch. She is only an unfortunate, broken-hearted thing, her mind shattered by the impressment of her son. But let me have the glass. There is another sail in the offing! It is a mere white speck on the horizon!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER IV. Leaving the merchant and the mate to make out the new sail which has just hove in sight in the southern board, we will follow Barbara Frankland to the habitation of Mad Margaret, as the female whom we have introduced into the preceding chapters was usually designated. The maiden, after leaving the summit of the hill, which was not more than forty rods over, descended on the west side by a rude pathway formed by the removal of loose stones and fragments of the ledge. Part of the way led over the face of the smooth stone, and in some places was so steep that she had to assist her descent by holding on to the low fern bushes, which grew by the sides. The cot in which Margaret lived, was situated under the ledge, close to the water-side, and at the extremity of the path by which she had come down to it from the hill-top. It was a small, one-story tenement, with a door and window in one end, the other sides being closely boarded up. It was blackenedwith age and the weather, and at a distance could scarcely be distinguished from the rocks which overhung it. A rude stone chimney was built up on the outside of the hut, and as Barbara approached, a small wreath of smoke was curling upward into the heavens. A single pine tree which had taken root in a crevice of the ledge, grew so as to lean far over the cottage and lend it the only shadow it got from the noon-tide sun. There was a wreck of an old boat lying on the beach by the door, and though it was worthless, seemed to be preserved with great care; for a rough shed built of strips, hides and drift-wood had been erected over it, and it was carefully propped up by stones and billets of wood placed beneath the bow and stern. As Barbara passed it, she glanced at it and looked as if she understood the motive which led to its preservation, for she said, “Her poor boy! How her heart is bound up in everything which once was his!” She now reached the door, and paused to listen with something like fear ere she knocked. From where she stood she could see the sloop-of-war, which was anchored directly opposite the cottage, and also on her right the town close at hand and in full view; but the signal-staff and her own home were hidden from her by the shoulder and brow of the hill. She had raised her hand to tap upon the door, when the voice of Margaret from within arrested her: “Don't stop to knock at my door, sweet maiden. I knew it was you coming. I know that light step in a hundred. Come in, come in! for your presence is a blessing to any roof you pass under.” Barbara opened the door of the hut and entered. Margaret was upon her knees before the fire, blowing it up into a flame. As the red glare of the live coals enkindled by her breath was reflected from her swarthy, wild features, Barbara involuntarily drew back a step, for there was something in her appearance then that confirmed the universal belief in her supernatural character. “You are welcome, Miss Barbara,” she said, rising to her feet, and extending her hand to the beautiful girl, who looked embarrassed and as if awe-stricken. “I am always glad to see you on my hearth-stone! God's blessing always goes before and follows after the good and pure. What will ye that I should do for you?” This was said in a rough and masculine manner, but there was a deep vein of kindness beneath the outward seeming. And as she spoke, she placed an old chair with a bottom of smooth ox-hide for her. “Sit ye, Miss Barbara, sit ye. Ye must be tired coming over the rocks, for it is not often that the feet of gentles like you, walk so rough a road.” “I walk in rougher paths than that, Margaret,” answered Barbara. “You forget what a famous walker I am.” “True! true! I have met you in many a wild place by the bay shore gathering shells. But that was for your pleasure. You have not come here now for pleasure. You have business with me.” “Business, Margaret!” repeated Barbara with a blush that overspread her cheeks with the quickness of lightning. “What business can I have with you? Here is a Spanish coin my father sent you, and I have come to see if you are in want of any thing.” “Thanks to your father, maiden, for this,” answered Margaret, taking the silver piece; “the blessing of the Bible will be upon him and his, for he remembereth the poor. But thou hast not come alone to give me this, nor to see how the world and I fare together, sweet maiden,” said Margaret, fixing her dark eye impressively upon her face. “Do I not visit you as often as once a month, Margaret? Why should you attribute other matters now to my visit than a desire to know of your welfare?” “Because there are causes for it, sweet lady,” answered the woman in a decided and almost severe tone. “Why will you try to deceive me? I can read thy thoughts in thy face. There is something on thy mind that thou wouldst consult with me upon.” Barbara became deadly pale, and gazed upon the singular woman with fear and surprise. “Can she divine my thoughts?” she asked herself, amazed; for she had indeed sought her hut to consult her, but after reaching the hut, she had laughed at herself, and resolved not speak to her upon the subject which weighed upon her thoughts. But when she saw that she had discovered through that keenness of observation which often characterises madness, that there was a secret at her heart, she resolved that she would not go away without laying it before her. Nevertheless, she did not like at once to confess her power and influence over her, inasmuch as hitherto she had never regarded her in the superstitious light in which she had been held by a large portion of the community, even by intelligent persons of good family and estate. She therefore said, making an effort to laugh off her surprise at having her purpose so readily divined by the extraordinary woman. “You know, Margaret, I am not one of your believers. I give you more credit than most others for good sense, and being like other people.” “Yet at this moment you believe in me. You had faith in me, or you would not have come hither. Speak freely and openly, madam. I love thee and honor thee, and if in my power, I will serve thee. What is it on thy mind that troubles thee, and makes thy eye restless, and thy cheek as changing as the autumn sky. I read a secret in thy bosom as soon as I saw thy face in the door.” “Then I will tell thee, Margaret, though I did intend to return and not mention it,” answered Barbara, who spoke with an air of confidence and sincerity that showed she felt that she might find council and wisdom in the words even of Mad Margaret. Before speaking, she let her eyes wander round the hut, as if to collect her thoughts for the revelation she had to make, and in their tour they rested on a pair of oars wrapped in old faded crape above the mantelpiece, a jacket and straw hat also marked with a bow of crape hung over the window, and two or three other mementoes of Margaret's lost boy, sacredly preserved by the poor crazed mother. “I have had a dream, Margaret, that has troubled me,” at length said the maiden. “Dreams are from Heaven, maiden; speak without fear.” “I should not have regarded it had it been but once that I dreamed, but I have had three nights in succession the same dream.” “Then it will become true,” answered Margaret. “Three is a perfect number. Did I not say that thou hudst something at heart, which led thee to come to me to-day? What is thy dream? Perhaps I can unweave its truths for thee. Was it an evil or a happy dream?” “I hardly know. It was both good and evil. But I am very foolish to tell it, or to have let it fix itself so in my thoughts. But having told Edith, my maid, she advised me to come and consult you, for she has great faith in you, Margaret, and she related three or four instances in which you had explained dreams which had proved as you said they would. You know I am not superstitious and am too good a Christian, I trust, to believe in any supernatural power you may be supposed to possess, still, I have a sort of confidence that you may be able to divine the meaning of my dream.” “All dreams have not interpretations. Some dreams are mere broken shadows that pass over the mind, of the events of the day, or events wished for. But true dreams all have a meaning to those who study it; maiden. Let me hear thy dream.” “I fancied that I was a bird, and was very happily singing in my native woods, when a hawk pursued me and I flew in terror. It seemed to me that the woods suddenly turned into my father's garden, and that as I tried to conceal myself in the thick foliage of the tree that grew under my window, the hawk pressed me so closely, and with his fierce cries so terrified me, that I dashed through the glass into the room.— My room then suddenly became a cage, and I found myself a prisoner to a very handsome youth, who held the cage by its ring, and talked to me encourageingly, as if he had himself rescued me from the hawk. While he was gazing on me, my father came in and asked him to sell the bird, as he wished to purchase it for his daughter; for so strongly did my dream shift its characters about. The young man, whose features I cannot distinctly recall, and who was dressed in very humble apparel, like a seaman, I think, answered that he would not sell me at any price, as he had obtained me at the risk of his life. Upon this my father said, `If thou wilt give me the bird, thou shalt have my daughter; for if I have not that bird in thy cage, my daughter will die of grief for it.' The young man then said, `How can she wish for what she can never have seen?' `Then, said my father, she hath dreamed of such a bird from her childhood. But I will go and bid her come to thee.' My father then left the room, and in my struggles to tell him that I was his daughter in the cage, I awoke. Three times I have dreamed the same dream without the least variation. Now, Margaret, if you can unravel it for me, you will do me a great kindness; for, to tell you truly, it troubles me not a little; though I am silly to suffer it to do so, and am, no doubt, very foolish to tell it to you; for I have no faith in dreams. But I promised Edith I would tell it to you.” “I have listened to every word of it, maiden,” answered Margaret, with a thoughtful brow. “I think I can tell you what your dream signifies. But first let me ask you if you have dreamed from your childhood of a little bird, as your father said!” “No, never, that I know of. It was only in my dream that my father said so.” “Do you remember the color of the eyes of the hawk?” “Yes, indeed, I do! for they seemed human as they looked upon me. They were a bright grey.” “And do you remember the color of the eyes of the young man?” “Hazel, and full of expression. He was very handsome, indeed, though he seemed poor or of humble origin.” Do you recollect even seeing her in your waking moments?” “Never. The face was new to me! and I have such an indistinct recollection of the features, though the impression they left is pleasing, I should hardly recognise him were he living. But it can't be that I should dream of the face of one who is really alive, but never sean by me!” “It would be more wonderful, maiden, to dream of a face of one who never had existed,” answered Margaret. “It is a very remarkable dream. But it has its meaning. But will you believe what I interpret?” “If it is not wrong to listen to you?” “It is not wrong. I am no witch nor dealer with evil spirits, lady. He who hath taken from me human reason, hath given me the power of a keen understanding. What I have lost in the overturn of my senses, hath been made up to me in spiritual strength. Once I could not see so sharply and so far as I do now; yet I was happier; for it is not good to know too much of hidden knowledge while in the frail body.— Yet what I know shall be thine!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER V. Barbara Frankland listened with awe and fear, to the singular words of the extraordinary person, whose presence she had sought, half in fear, half faithless, touching her reputation for revealing dreams. “If I thought you were gifted with powers beyond our human nature, Mar garet, I should fear to hear what you have to say,” she said, gravely. “Then, why have you sought me, lady? But fear not, I will give thee the meaning of thy dream, as my wisdom teaches it to me. It is a good dream to thee, maiden, if thou art humble, and despisest not lowness of condition in any one; but thy pride of wealth and station may make it an evil one to thee.” “I trust I have no pride, Margaret.” “The least, lady, that one in thy place ever had. Thine is the pride of beauty, and of conscious goodness, rather than of rank, so I do not fear but the dream will be a good one for thee.” “I hope it will,” answered Barbara, who began to feel deeply interested in the disclosure she was about to hear made, and to feel something of a superstitious reverence for her upon her spirit. “The hawk which pursued you,” began Margaret, without consulting either tea-cup or cards, or going through any of the mystic ceremonies that the professed witches of that day were accustomed to use. She did not even look at the lines in the palm of the maiden's hand. But she took the hand, soft and tremulous in her grasp, and fixing her large, dark eyes upon her fair, youthful brow, said, impressively, “the hawk that pursued you, and from which you fled in terror, was human. It was represented to you in your dream under the form of a hawk, for such is the character of one whom you must fear, and who will pursue you. You will, under the sanctity of your father's house, find shelter from this enemy, but only by becoming captive to another.” “How?” asked the maiden, whose eye beamed with the deepest interest, though her heart trembled between hope and fear. “That is not for me to reveal. You will escape one pursuer to fall into the power of another who did not seek you, but whose you become as a bird in a cage is imprisoned. It will depend upon the impression the young man made upon you in your dream, whether this captivity be happy or miserable.” “He made a most favorable impression. Indeed, I never saw a more noble countenance, and his voice as he spoke to me, was full of music. If I had not been a bird, I thought I could have listened to it forever.” “Then your captivity will be a happy one, and your dream a good dream.” “But my father, and his wish to purchase me?” “That must remain unexplained.” “And the young man's answer, that he had risked his life for me, and for no price would he let me go—will you explain this?” “It will come to pass, and let this be enough for you to know, maiden. Your dream will all become real. It warns and encourages you. It bids you be on your guard, and it encourages you to feel assured that when danger is most imminent, that when even the sanctuary of your father's home will not protect you, then will aid come to you from a source you little hoped for. This is all that I have to say, save that, if you become not too proud, the dream is for good and not for evil. But if you are proud in the hour of your fate, darkness and sorrow will come upon you as a tempest in the midnight.” “I tremble at your words, Margaret; your manner, too, causes me to fear you.” “I speak only the thoughts that pass through my mind, lady. Were they full of evil and woe to thee, I should utter them, but fear them not. They are for thy good; as I have said to thee, if thou art humble and grateful, and presume not upon thy wealth and station in the hour of thy trial.” “What trial do you speak of so sol elmnly, Margaret? In spite of myself, your language makes a deep impression upon my mind. And yet I know you can tell me nothing that is in the future. I feel that I have been very weak to come to you, and that you are mocking my folly by answering me according to it. “Fair maid, I have spoken truly, and in fear of judgment for my words in the day when every idle word will be adjudged. All thou hast to do, is to believe thy dream, and be on thy guard, and to remember that in the hour of thy greatest trial, thou wilt have succor, though it will be secured by thy own captivity.” “Then I see danger is before me in all, for it is not good to be a captive. “That will depend on him to whom thou art a captive, and upon thyself.” “My mind is not relieved by my visit to you, Margaret,” said the maiden, rising. “In giving too much thought and weight to a mere dream, because it was repeated thrice, and in coming to thee about it, I have made myself superstitious, and if I am in no otherwise a captive, I am become a slave to thy words. I shall be constantly in bondage of fear to your interpretation, whether I believe it or reject it, for you have spoken so seriously, that I cannot throw off the serious impression you have fixed upon my mind, that your words are true. But how is it that you have set aside cards, and casting my nativity, and examining the lines in my hand, Margaret? If you had used these, common signs of fortune-telling, I should have had less faith in what you have revealed.” “I use these toys,” answered Margaret, with an expression of contempt on her dark features, “because the common mind asks for such visible marks to pin its faith on, but with thee, there is no need to resort to such follies, fit only to take the vulgar eye. But do not be troubled at my explanation of your dream, for thy fate and happiness will be in thine own hands. Hark, what firing is that we hear?” she cried, as the report of a cannon not far distant shook the hut in which they stood. “It is an English schooner-of-war just arrived,” said Barbara, who threw open the door and looked out, while in rapid succession nine guns were fired, falling on the ear like the continued reverberations of peals of thunder. “Yes, and may they all sink in the depths of the sea! My curse and the curse of the orphan and the oppressed light on them all!” cried Margaret, her eye flashing fire as she surveyed the newly arrived schooner, as enveloped in the smoke of her firing, she passed up, saluting the man-of-war. “Ah, Bab, you are here then,” cried Mr. Frankland, approaching. “I hope you have told her a good fortune, Margaret, and the tea-grounds were all favorable,” he said, laughing. “I see, Margaret, you are looking at the schooner with no loving eyes. There's more than one in Newport, that loves her presence as little as you ssem to do.” “They have their reasons, and I mine, sir,” responded Margaret. “Two of them! was it not enough that one come, but another should follow close to its heels? My two-fold malediction be on them! May the winds be foul and the sea shoal to them, and the waves overwhelm them!” “Nay, Margaret, you should forgive them.” “Forgive?” repeated the woman with a haughty look, “forgive?” she continued with fierce scorn. “Yes, when they bring me back my boy, and God gives me back my reason.” With these words she strode away from them and re-entered her hut, closing the door after her. “A strange creature, Barbara,” said Mr. Frankland. “Yes, sir, and fearful. I never till to-day had faith in her supernatural powers.” “And have you now?” asked her father, with a look of surprise. “She has told me—” “And what has she told thee, child? If of the past, thou knowest it as well as she. If of the future, time has to test the truth of her words. So if she hath been working on thy fears, neither heed her nor her words, for they are vanity and air. She is a poor, mad creature, with her brain full of phantasles, and a pity it is people have persuaded her that she hath the powers of fortune-telling. Public credulity is all the capital she ever had. But I forgot to tell thee that a brig is below, coming up, and which I believe to the Free Trader; and if it turns out to be her, I shall be pretty busy, so I have come after thee to see thee home in saftey, for you see it is within a few minutes of sunset.” “And, sir, do you resolve to evade the duties to the crown, if this-should be your brig coming up?” she asked earnestly, her eyes following the schooner, which having crossed un der the stern of the sloop as if hailing her, was moving ahead and nearer to the town, shortening sail as she approached the shoaler anchorage ground. “These two armed vessels look menacing.” “Their presence will not prevent me from carrying out my purpose, daughter. Resistance to the impost, is a principle which no extraneous circumstances should or can be allowed to affect. Would you have me pay the duty, and then acknowledge the right of England to bind us by her tyrannical laws?” “No, father. But I tremble lest you should be a sufferer.” “I shall do my duty and leave the event with Heaven. I know you are too patriotic and brave, to wish me to compromit my honor for fear of personal consequences. But do not fear. They will not touch my person. The worst that can befall me, if I am detected in smuggling my goods into town, will be the loss of my vessel and cargo. But I had rather risk these than be false to my principles as a free-born colonist. But let us return over the hill, as I wish to give an order or two to Finch, should the brig prove to be the Free-Trader.” They ascended the steep path-way to the summit, which they had no sooner came in sight of, than they heard the mate hailing them. “It is the brig, your honor. She has hoisted her private signal. Look, sir,” he added, as Mr. Frankland hastened to meet him and receive the spy-glass from his hand. “Yes, three balls at her main,” cried the merchant. “It is my brig! Get ready the signal you brought with you in the bag, master Finch. Now is the revenue test nearer at hand than we supposed, or than the commissioners and the captain of the sloop imagine.” The face of the merchant wore a quiet smile of satisfaction, as he gazed on the approaching brig, while his eye brightened up with the resolute purpose of his soul. Finch prepared the signals and tied them to the halyards, and got all ready to hoist, with his eye fixed on Mr. Frankland, waiting for his orders. “How far distant is she, sir?” asked Barbara, who seemed to be almost as deeply interested in the brig's approach as her father and master Finch. “About four miles now, nigh enough for our purpose. Hoist away, Finch.” “Hoist it is, sir,” answered the old sailor, as hand over hand he sent the fluttering blue and white flags, four in number, to the truck of the signal staff. “Don't belay, Finch, but hold on till I watch her, and see if she answers it.” The merchant then placed the glass to his eye, and looked for some minutes closely at the brig, which still stood on as before. “I fear she don't see it, your honor.” “Yes, they lower and raise the three balls. They have done it twice. It is enough. Haul down the signals, for I don't want to keep them flying there long enough to attract the attention of the sloop-of-war.” “There, she hauls her wind, your honor. She understands what the flags say, as well as if it was print in a book. She is going about.” “Yes, all is as favorable as I could have wished. Now, Barbara, let us hasten home. I must change this dinner costume for a working one, for this will be a busy night with me.” “Shall I knock off watch here, sir?” “Yes. Roll up your flags and come down to the house, Finch, and I will then tell you what you are to do, for you are to be my right-hand man to-night.” Thus speaking the merchant drew his daughter's arm within his, and let her from the summit, just as the sloop lowered her ensign and fired her sunset gun.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER VI. Notwithstanding the few moments during which the signals to the Free-Trader were suffered to fly, they attracted the notice of the commissioner, Mr. Riverton, who had accompanied the officers on board their ship when they returned after dinner. The signals, themselves, would not have been observed by the captain of the sloop but for the commissioner, who was at the time walking the deck with him, and speaking upon the subject of the hostility of the merchants to the revenue laws. As they turned in their walk, and just as Mr. Riverton was giving Captain Petty a sketch of the character and influence of Mr. Frankland, and declaring that if there were offered any open resistance to the levying of the tribute, this gentleman would be at the head of it, his eye caught sight of the signals flying on the flag-staff. “There is mischief there, I fear!” he said, stopping and pointing to the hill. “Do you see those flags?” “Yes,” answered the captain, “I discovered them before you did, a moment or two since, but supposed they were merely signals of the brig's approach into port to her owner.” “That flag is not the usual signal for a brig. It is a telegraphic communication.” “Give me the glass, sir,” said Captain Petty to his quarter-master. “I will look at the brig.” “They mean more than to tell her owner of her approach,” said the com missioner, a good deal excited. “What do you discover, sir?” “The brig has lowered two black balls at her main and hoisted them twice. It is a telegraphic communication with her, as you say.” “See! The brig is putting about! and the signals are also hauled down. Captain, if you please, let me see who are upon the hill? This is all very singular!” The spy-glass was placed in the commissioner's hands, which were half hidden in deep lace ruffles, and he had not gazed upon the shore but a moment, before, with a flushed cheek, he turned to the captain, and said, with animation— “Would you believe it, sir? One of those persons is Mr. Frankland, of whom we were just speaking. His daughter is with him, I think. He has had those signals set for the brig, which is his own; for I was yesterday looking carefully over the records of the vessels, and noting their private signals, and I remember that two black balls was that of the Free-Trader, one of Mr. Frankland's brigs.” “What can be the object in telegraphing her?” asked the captain, as he kept the spy-glass to bear upon the female figure, which had been discovered on the height. “Perhaps to keep away, as you see she has done. In my opinion, sir, he intends that she shall land her cargo on some uninhabited part of the shore of the bay, and have it carted up to town by night, thus evading the duties.” “Then I will defeat him,” answered the captain, with a smile; “this little eight-gun schooner has arrived in port just in time. I will despatch her out after the brig as soon as the sun goes down, so that the brig may not see her movements; and if she attempts to land her cargo to-night, we will pounce upon them in the very business. How would you like to go down in the Gaspee?” “Is it the Gaspee schooner now coming up so gallantly? I have heard a good deal of her exploits.” “Yes, it is the brave little Gaspee! I asked the admiral to let me have her as a sort of tender, for shoal water affairs, and running up the bay and into the creeks. She has arrived just in time to do good service. Yes, the brig has fairly turned her stern towards us, and is running close-hauled down the bay.” “It is, you may be assured, captain, a plan for stealing her cargo ashore,” said Mr. Riverton. “If the merchants are going to be so sharp in their wits, we must sharpen ours to keep up with them. I will go down in the schooner, for it is my place to be on the spot when the brig is boarded. I shall be a happy man to defeat Mr. Frankland in his patriotic purposes of evading the duties,” said the commissioner, rubbing his palms together and chuckling at the prospect of making a seizure of the brig and cargo. “After he loses one richly laden bark, he will be more willing to submit to the crown's just laws.” The schooner now came so near as to commence saluting the Bexley, and as she passed under her stern, Captain Petty hailed her, and ordered the lieutenant in command to run in and anchor with a short cable, and then come on board of him. “Aye, aye, sir!” responded the officer, touching his blue cap; and Mr. Riverton admired how gracefully the little cruiser glided onward towards the town, like a bird on the wing. “Bless me, captain, what a beautiful object a vessel is, particularly a vessel of war! In my opinion, a ship under sail is the finest sight in the world. This Gaspee is a saucy looking rogue and shows her teeth as savage as a bulldog. She will do us good service in the bay, especially in cruising above; for it is my opinion that more than one foreign vessel will discharge outside into some Providence trading sloop, and so the sloop would run up with a rich cargo to that town, and I might whistle for her to stop and pay duties.” “I swear every craft that goes up the bay shall be boarded and strictly overhauled,” answered the captain. “That is right, sir. I see you resolve to make thorough work of the matter, sir, and we are fortunate in having so efficient an officer in the service sent to this station.” And the commissioner bowed politely, and the captain slightly acknowledged the compliment with a nod. Mr. Riverton was about to make some other remark, when the ensign came floating down about his head, and his ears were stunned by the loud discharge of an eighteen-pounder within ten feet of him. “Bless me! what is that? Really, captain, one must screw up his nerves on ship-board.” “It was the sunset-gun, sir,” observed the captain, quietly, while he smiled at the start which it had given the precise and uninitiated commissioner. The captain now invited his guest below to take coffee, and wait for the lieutenant of the Gaspee to come on board and receive his instructions; and while the commissioner is penning at the table a brief note to his deputy to be sent on shore, we will go forward to another part of the vessel, and on the gun-deck, where a young man is seated, his hands and feet manacled. He was alone—and through the open port gazing upon the town and the green shores, with an expression of mingled pleasure and pain. “So, my lad,” said the boatswain, coming along past him, “you thought you would get ashore here, while we were anchored in the harbor; but it is no go! Ten pound of iron ain't the best thing to swim with. You missed stays that time, my lad. You ought to consider yourself lucky you did n't get my cat with thirty-nine on your back!” The young man merely smiled, and looked out of the port as before. But there was a compression of the mouth and a fire in his eye that showed a spirit that even chains had not cowed or broken. The boatswain passed on, muttering— “He is a brave fellow, and I am glad I had n't orders given me to tie him up for it!” He was again alone, for the crew were seated in messes between the guns at supper, heedless of him. In a few moments, a youthful officer, in a blue cap, with a gold band around it, and a sword at his side, came near him, and after regarding him a moment, said, in tones of mingled reproach and sorrow. “I grieve to see you in this condition, Martin; I am sorry you did not preserve more caution, if you intended to escape from the ship. If you had delayed till to-night, and dropped overboard under cover of the darkness, you might have got your liberty.” “I could not delay, Mr. Althorp, in the very sight of my mother's roof. I even beheld her, or fancied I did. You would have done what I did, sir, if you had been four years and a half torn away from your home as I have been,” added the young man, between grief and indignation, his fine features flushed with deep emotion. “I see now, sir, that it would have been wiser for me to have waited a better season; but who can blame me, sir? It was with difficulty I could repress my emotions, as we came to anchor, and I beheld before me the dear scenes which, for nearly five years, have been in my thoughts by day and in my dreams by night. It is hard, sir, that I should wear these chains,” he said, rising and standing up to the full height of his manly form, and clanking his bands as he spoke of them; “it is hard that I should wear these for loving my country and my home!' “It is, indeed, Martin,” answered the young officer, with feeling. “And if I can help you,” he added, in a lower tone of voice, and looking round to see that he was not overheard, “you shall not wear them longer than the middle watch!” “Indeed, sir! Are you then still my friend?” exclaimed the young seaman, with surprise and pleasure. “Yes, Martin; do you suppose I can ever forget your gallantry in springing into the water to save me from the shark; as I was bathing at Port Praya; killing him with your own knife in the water! No, no: I owe my life to you, and I will try to return you some part of the debt of gratitude I owe you! If you wish to escape to-night, I will aid you!” “I wish to escape, sir, God knows!” answered the young-man, earnestly: “for my heart yearns once more to embrace my mother, if, indeed, she still lives! But, sir,” and he hesitated, and then said, “but, sir, I do not wish to implicate you in my escape. Rather than you should suffer, I would prefer to stay where I am, and trust to the clemency of the captain to let me go free!” “He will not release you while the ship is in port, for fear you will escape on shore; and you are, he says, too good a seaman for him to lose you.— You have no hope then, Martin. You must, therefore, let me aid you! Do not fear any evil to me, for I trust we shall manage the matter so secretly, that it will be known only to you and I; will you consent?” “Consent, sir! who would refuse liberty?” answered the young man, grasping his hand. “Heaven bless you, Mr. Althorp! I did not know I had a friend in all this ship!” “You have many, Martin; but they fear to express their sympathy with you There is not a sailor of your mess, who would not rejoice in your escape!” “Well, sir, I will do whatever you say,” answered the young man. “I only do not wish to have you censured.” “Think not of me, my brave Martin. Now let me tell you that I have arranged everything before I came to you I have succeeded in secretly obtaining the key to your irons; and after it is dark abroad, and just as the bells, at the close of the dog-watch, are striking, I will be here. Here is the key; and take advantage of the noise made in piping hammocks down, to unlock your irons; but keep them on till I come to you.” “How can I thank you, sir!” “You have already repaid me. I feel that you are, like all the impressed colonists, unjustly detained in the service; and it is a pity, after being so long absent and in sight of your native town, you cannot reach it.” “I ought not to have told so freely among the men my joy that the Bexley was coming here to Newport, and mentioned to the purser's clerk, whom I thought my well-wisher, that I should, if I could, quit the ship here. I have no doubt, sir, it was he who betrayed me.” “It was, Martin. As the captain's gig was ordered along side to take him off to the commissioner's to dine, the clerk asked the captain, in my hearing, if he knew that this was your native town? And hinted that he had understood you would try to escape.” “And it was this, then, that led the captain to order another coxswain to take my place, when I had already seated myself in the stern-sheets?” asked Martin, indignantly. “Yes; and at the same time, he hurried to give orders to the boatswain to bring a pair of irons, when you sprang overboard, and began to swim for the shore!” “I felt, sir, that I should rather be shot in the attempt, than not make it!” “I understand your feelings perfectly, Martin. But here comes a light! I must go! Now, keep quiet until eight o'clock!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER VII. The conversation which had been carried on between the young officer and the chained seaman, had been broken off by the approach of one of the lieutenants, who was showing the ship to the commissioner, and also the men at their suppers. The two young men had not been overheard, and the obscurity of the hour, and the part of the deck, where Martin was chained to a gun-carriage, shielded them from observation as they talked; but when the lieutenant appeared, preceded by a messenger-boy bearing a lantern, the youthful midshipman who interested himself so deeply in favor of the young colonist left him, adding to his last words, and speaking in a stern tone, “You will not escape so easily the next time, my lad! If I had been captain, I would have given you thirty-nine with the boatswain's cat.” “Ah, Althorp, who is it you are verating in that style, hey?” asked the lieutenant, coming up. “The coxswain of the captain's gig, sir, who wanted to escape ashore and is now doing penance in irons.” “Who is he? What is he?” asked the commissioner who, having rarely visited a ship-of-war, was full of curiosity to see and know everything that was going on; and for this purpose had asked to be shown about the decks. “A young colonist seaman, sir,” answered the lieutenant, in an indifferent tone; “it seems he wanted his liberty before we chose to give it to him, and he is now ironed by way of contrast.” “Why, he seems to bear himself bravely,” remarked the commissioner, looking closely through his glasses at the young man, as he stood folding his chains up in his arms and silently and scornfully regarding him, for he felt indignant at being gazed upon, as if he had been a wild beast. “Yes, these colonists are the most intractable of all our sailors. It is as difficult to tame them into submission as one of their own Indian chiefs.— They are good sailors, and as brave as lions in battle; but there is no doing anything with them without the severest discipline.” “They have some of the spirit of the people ashore,” answered the commissioner. “He is a fine looking young man; and it is a pity,” he added, addressing the chained sailor, “that you cannot serve your king and country more submissively.” “My country is served best by my resistance,” answered Martin, proudly. “I am a free-born American, and no British slave to kiss the hand that smites me. Yet they would have made me a slave, and stole me from my childhood's home! And dost thou, grey haired old man, dost thou ask me to be more submissive?” “Bless me! what a spirit!” exclaimed the commissioner; “let us pass on, sir, for there is mischief in his eye.— He might make a spring upon one and do damage with those heavy chains.” “Go, old man, I will not harm thee, though thou hast cause for fear; for if I guess rightly, thou art a sycophant to the crown and a traitor to thy country.” “Silence!” cried the lieutenant, sternly. “Thou givest too much license to thy speech. I will teach thee that the tongue may be chained as well as the limbs. “He is an extraordinary young man,” added the officer, as he continued on with Mr. Riverton; “he is intelligent, well-read, skilful in all his duties beyond other seamen, and full of courage. Every man likes him, save some few who envy him. It is a pity to have to put him in irons. But he is the coxswain of the captain's gig, and it was his intention to have escaped when she reached the town; but his purpose was discovered in time; when he sprang overboard and would have swam ashore. He was picked up, brought on board and ironed here as you have just seen him. As soon as we leave the port we shall let him have his liberty again; but it would be unsafe while in this anchorage, for I learn that he was impressed from this town some years ago in the Thetis frigate.” “Ah, I remember when she was here; I had the honor of dining on board of her; and also of attending a brilliant ball given by Captain Montague. She pressed several of the young farmers about, I was told, and some of the poor towns-folk's younger ones. The king is very fortunate in having such extensive colonies to supply his navy from.” “Yes; they are the best sailors, as I have said, that we have, after we get them broke in.” “Sir, the lieutenant of the Gaspee is just come on board,” said the captain's liveried servant to Mr. Riverton, “and Captain Petty would be happy to see you in his cabin.” “True, I will go to him at once.— Brave doings we shall have to-night, Mister Lieutenant,” said the commissioner, rubbing his hands together as he always did when very much pleased with matters and things. “The Gaspee I hear is going down after a brig that put back after coming nearly up to town.” “Yes, and we shall seize her—not the least doubt of it. I shall feel myself honored in being so lucky as to make the first seizure under the law.” “Is there any probability, sir?” asked the lieutenant, as they mounted the steps to the upper-deck and walked aft along the gun deck. “Is there the least probability that the citizens will assist the merchants in opposing the duties?” “The towns' people are very much excited at the sight of the sloop-of-war here, but its presence will keep down their courage. But I should really have trembled for the consequences to myself if I had gone on board a vessel to levy the duties, without such support as I now have in the presence of an armed vessel.” “Well, we shall be ready for any opposition they may choose to show,” answered the officer, as they reached the door which led into the captain's cab in, where he bowed and took his leave. The commissioner was ushered in by the footman, where he found in conversation with Captain Petty, Lieutenant Arling of the Gaspee. This gentleman was an exceedingly handsome and accomplished young English officer, richly dressed, and evidently displaying the man of fashion so far as it could be done in the uniform of the navy. He was tall and nobly formed, with a fine, piercing eye of dark grey, the expression of which indicated a fiery and daring spirit. His mouth, which was remarkably well shaped, would have been the best feature in a face where all was symmetry and manly beauty, but for a slight muscular curve at the corners, in which was stamped as plainly as if written, the evil passions of cruelty and sensuality The commissioner did not at all like his looks, although he was struck with the elegance of his person and not a little abashed by his fashionable and somewhat haughty demeanor; for the commander of the Gaspee was the younger son of a nobleman. “Here is the Newport commissioner, Mr. Riverton,” said Captain Petty, who, be it said in passing, was a baronet, with the title of Sir William, as the citizen entered the cabin. “This is the commander of the Gaspee, Lieutenant Arling.” “Ah, Mr. Commissioner, I am glad to meet you,” said the lieutenant, looking at him over his shoulder, but without rising or extending his hand; for in the opinions of all true-blooded Englishmen colonists, although they might be tories and staunch king's men, and ministry men, were plebeians. I hear from Captain Petty, that you suspect the brig that was a couple of leagues astern of me, belongs to a Newport merchant, and has run down the coast to land her dutiable freight by night.” “Yes, sir, that is my conviction.” “And you desire to go in the Gasper I believe, for Sir William Petty has ordered me to look after the brig.” “I think my office requires my presence, sir, and should prefer being on the spot.” “Very well, Mr. Rivers—” “Riverton, sir,” corrected the commissioner, who less and less liked the young commander of the Gaspee. “Beg pardon, Mr. Rivington”— “Riv—” “Are you ready to go on board?” “Yes, sir,” responded the commissioner, contrasting the well-bred courtesy of Sir William, with the rude hauteur of the honorable lieutenant. “Do you think you will be able to get back to-morrow?” “Yes, if we get through our affair and the wind favors,” answered the lieutenant, rising. “Well, Sir William, I will go on board; and if the brig runs you, give me permission to fire into her and treat her as an enemy?” “Yes, but let the two first guns be blank and five minutes between each.” “I obey, sir; but you give too much grace to these Yankee colonists.” “We must recollect that they are the king's subjects as well as we, and are not therefore to be treated as enemies that we are at war with.” “If there are not some examples made of these stubborn people, they will get so ere long as to declare war against the crown,” answered the lieutenant, as he went out with the captain to the quarter-deck. His boat was already under the entering-post, and after receiving one or two words of caution from the captain as to his management of the enterprise, the lieutenant went over the side and got into his boat, followed by the commissioner; who, although he did not well like the distance at which Mr. Arling kept himself, was still so earnest in the desire to be wanting in nothing as a commissioner of revenues, that he resolved still to accompany him down the bay in pursuit of the brig. “Let fall,” cried the coxswain as his officer seated himself. “Give way,” was the next brief command, and the boat left the ship's side and in five minutes more was along side the schooner. By this time it was deep twilight, the stars struggling with the glowing west to rule the night. Mr. Arling, upon reaching his deck, gave orders to weigh the anchor, and loose the topsail, jib and mainsail. “Let there be no noise of singing out about it, Mr. Carroll,” he said, to the passed midshipman, who was first officer. “I wish to slide away from the anchorage quietly. The brig which came up astern of us is supposed to be inclined to drop her cargo on the coast; for she turned back as soon as she saw the sloop-of-war.” “She was telegraphed, sir! Telegraphed and warned by her owners, I saw it done,” chimed in the commissioner, very earnestly; for he wished to have all the merit of the affair that was on the carpet, that he could safely lay claim to; for next to his gratification at having been honored with a commission from the crown, was his determination that the king should see that he was worthy of the trust reposed in him. He seemed instinctively to appreciate his unfitness, by talents or information for the office, and, therefore, felt proportionably grateful for an appointment which he never dreamed of receiving, and for which he had no other recommendation than his blind and fawning toryism. His desire, therefore to make himself acceptable to the high powers in his new position, led him to volunteer to go in the schooner, and to overcome his nervous antipathy to guns and gun-powder. His zeal, in one word, over-topped his cowardice. The schooner was in a few minutes under her canvass, and with the wind as it was, able to lay her course, close hauled down the bay. Just as she began to move away from her anchorage, a small boat pulled out of a little cove not far below the hut of mad Margaret, and hugging the shore, moved rapidly down with the ebb tide. It contained three persons, two of whom rowed while the third sat in the stern and steered her with a third oar. This was the resolute merchant, Paul Frankland. One of the oarsman was mate Finch, and the other a negro servant belonging to the merchant. “We shall have to pull for an hour before we shall begin to think of seeing the brig,” said Mr. Frankland, as he glanced along the surface of the water with his head bent low, and his eyes brought nearly to a level with it.— “Pull strong and steadily and not lose breath by too rapid work. We have a hard night before us.” “The brig, your honor, ought to be coming back towards the harbor by this time,” remarked the mate, looking up at the stars and then round upon the dark shores, past which they were gliding. “The sun has been gone down full half an hour. But what is that moving a-beam? Upon my soul, your honor, there is the schooner that got in to-day, standing out again under all sail.” “Are you sure it is the same?” asked the merchant, quickly. “Sure?” answered Finch, very positively. “I can see between her masts, and know her rake. This means som'at, your honor.” “Yes, and means that she is after the Free-Trader,” responded the merchant, fixing his eyes steadily upon the indistinct form of the armed schooner as it passed down the bay, about a quarter of a mile distant.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER VIII. The boat which contained the merchant rowed on, close under the shore, keeping in the obscurity of its shadow to escape the observation of any sharp eyes on the deck of the schooner, while the latter favored by the wind and tide, passed rapidly by it and soon presented to them her stern lights. She was going about five miles an hour, while the boat rowed four, or a little over. “There is no doubt that this movement of the schooner's is owing to the brig's putting back,” said Mr. Frankland, after sometime, watching the vessel as it receded before him. “I hope, your honor, they won't be so lucky as to fall in with her and stop her,” answered the mate, as he bent his strong frame to the light oar.— “Row hard, Pompey! Get the oil in your elbows warm, and loosen your stiff joints. Throw your head and shoulders forward, and spring to it.” “Me do 'em bess, massa Finch. Me breakee him oar, me pull harder,” responded the negro. “Let 'em break. You have only to 'bey orders if you break owners, to say nothin' of oars.” “Yiss, massa,” responded the sable oarsman, as he threw his weight upon the oar, and nearly bent it into a bow, with renewed muscular exertion. “Your eyes are more used to seeing objects on the water than mine, master Finch,” observed Mr. Frankland. “Yes, I dare say, your honor. I can see at night without spectacles.” “Look over your shoulder occasionally and scan the water below us, for we may be able to make out the brig.— It is now an hour and a half since the sun went down, and if she put back at dark she ought to be pretty well up the bay by this time.” “Yes, your honor. When she tacked she was about five miles out. She probably ran out about five miles more, before she put about to run in again; that would give her, at this six knot breeze runnin' before it, about an hour and a half, to get in as far as Indian Rock.” “In that case we ought to see her very soon, for the Rock is not more than half a mile below us. I fear some difficulty will occur if the schooner falls in with her. Yet I do not see how she can help it. The channel is so narrow and the stars give light enough for one vessel to see another a mile off. The Gaspee must be full half a mile ahead of us, and yet we can still see her very distinctly.” “Is that the Gaspee schooner, sir?” asked the mate, quickly. “Yes, so I learned just before I left the town.” “Then her captain is wide awake.— She is a regular hard 'un to cruise.— Her leftenant is a lord's son, and dressed as rich as if he was just going to a tea-party, but he's a real fighter.— There's no back out to him and no flinch. His men, as was with him off Halifax, says he's a hard hand with his crew; and what's more, they say he hates the colonists as bad as he does the French, which, your honor knows, every Englishman is bound to hate.” But the merchant did not heed his words, his attention being closely fixed upon some object down the bay. He took off his chapeau and bent his head down over the gunwale, within a few inches of the surface of the water, and examined the horizon with the minutest inspection. “What does your honor see?” “I thought I saw the vessel just in range with the Indian Rock; but I must have been deceived.” “It might have been the Gaspy,” answered the mate, looking round. “No, I see the Gaspee to the right, standing down as before. The brig I thought that I discovered, close in with the Head; but I see nothing now.” “Perhaps, your honor, she has seen the schooner and has run in under the rock to anchor; for it was where you telegraphed her to wait for you to board her.” “But if she has discovered the Gaspee, the latter ought to have seen her also.” “Pr'aps they wasn't expecting to fall in with her so near port, seeing her stand out to sea afore dark, and so they han't been on the watch for her.” “Look! There is a flash! She has fired!” cried Mr. Frankland, as the sharp report of a twelve-pounder reached his ears from the Gaspee, which at the same moment was displayed in the light of day by the illumination. The light of the gun also showed the merchant the Indian Head Rock, with the mast and mainsail of a vessel just disappearing behind it. All was the next moment dark. “They have seen the brig, your honor!” “Yes. I saw her just passing the Head, and I was not deceived at first. The schooner has fired to bring her to. I hope they will not obey,” he said, standing up in his boat, much excited. “And well she might fire to make her come to, your honor for the Gaspy has kept so far to the westward that she has placed the channel shoal between her and the brig; and though it a'nt more nor a mile across, she'll have to run down three miles or come back two before she can get round it to reach her. This shows why she fited as soon as she saw her standing up to'ards the Head; and it shows also they didn't expect to fall in with the brig till they got at least as far down as where the channel shoal ends.” “You are right, Finch. You must be right.” “I knows I am, your honor. I know every fathom of the channel as well as I know the way to my own locker. The Gaspee's takin' the west channel down, has saved the brig, if that was the brig we saw.” “I am sure it was, though I could see only her main-mast as she went in under the curve of the shore below the Rock. I trust, if it is as you say, that the schooner can't get at her without going down the bay a league, and then coming up this side of the shoal, that the Free-Trader won't heed a few shots, but stand on.” “Cap'n Benbow is not a man to fear on, your honor.” “I know his courage well. He must be aware from my telegraphic communication, ordering him off till night, that something is in the wind, as you would say, Finch. But he will be surprised at being fired into by a strange vessel in this way. Pull on fast. Let us lose no time, and once on board the brig I shall know how to proceed.— Give way, strong.” “Aye, aye, sir,” answered the mate, and the two oarsmen sent the little boat along at a rate that ploughed up the foam ahead of her and tossed the spray over the merchant. But he heeded it not, nor cared for the wetting of his powdered curls; but standing up in the boat with his eyes keenly watching the schooner, which it was evident had hove to, he urged them to their task. “There again,” he suddenly cried, as the Gaspee's bow-port once more shot out a column of flame that illumined the horizon for a mile around her, showing the dark line of the shore, and the bold bluff of Indian Rock in dark relief. The next instant all was pitchy darkness from the contrast with the previous brilliancy. “The brig was not visible, Finch,” said the merchant, with animation. “She was hid by the rock, your honor; no doubt she is coming round in the curve where the channel runs, and will soon show her nose coming out beyond the head; for you know the channel takes a bend in there for half a mile-curve, so that from where we are a vessel would be invisible till she came out again.” “She won't come out; but anchor there as I telegraphed her to do; yet this firing may either drive her back to sea, or lead Captain Benbo to try to run up to Newport without heeding my signal.” “There is one thing sartain, your honor, and that is that the Gaspy had her fore-topsail a-back when she fired that last gun. That means something.” “That she intends to fire upon the brig, and cripple her till she will come to.” “It may be so; but I'm rather thinking, sir, she has laid to to send her boats out to board the brig. For as she can't get across the shore to her, and as she'd have to go too far round to catch her, she'll just send her boats across and take possession of her.” “If that is her purpose, she shall be defeated if human power can do it,” exclaimed the merchant. A rocket was now sent up by the schooner which showed her boats just putting off.— “Lose not a foot's way, but row for life and death. Pompey, a sovereign shall be your reward if we reach the brig before the Gaspee's boat. Master Finch, all depends now upon your exertions. Put me on board the Free-Trader and an ounce of gold shall be yours.” Mr. Frankland had caught a glimpse by the light of the rocket, as it expanded high in the air, of the brig just emerging from the headland, behind which she had been hidden by the curve in the shore, for the last ten minutes. He saw that she was crowding on all sail, and evidently resolved to reach her port in spite of the firing directed upon her. The merchant was calm and self-possessed, but his sparkling glance showed the stern resolution of his spirit. The distance of the boat from the brig was less than that of the schooner, and he felt that he should reach it first, especially as the Free-Trader was each moment coming nearer and lessening the space that the mate and Pompey had to row over. “We are like to have a warm affair, your honor,” quietly remarked Finch, as he dipped his oar deeply and strong. “I trust not. They have no right to fire into a colonial vessel; and less to board her. Their boats shall be resisted!” “And that will not be done without some fighting, your honor; and that's what I love. I ha'n't had a hand in any affair this four years, since we beat off them Spanish pirates in the Indies, where I got that bullet in my leg, that never'll let me stand watch in bad weather, without giving me the rheumatis'; otherwise, you wouldn't see me doing so much shore duty.” “Look along the water! Do you see the boats?” asked the merchant. “I see something beaming this way, about three points off my starboard rolock.” “That is what I see. It must be the boats; if so, we shall keep the lead of them. The brig is coming nearer and nearer. I can already distinguish her head sails.” “She an't more nor a quarter of a mile, your honor. Captain Benbow is determined to run in. We'll soon be aboard on her, your honor.” Captain Benbow, so frequently mentioned, was standing on the deck of his brig, with a spy-glass in his hand, with which he was intently watching the schooner. “I should like to know what the fellow means?” he said, in a tone of anger and obstinacy. “If it is a king's vessel, why don't he show his signal, and not fire into me in this fashion; and now sending his boats to board me, as if I was a pirate, or he was one. Can you understand this, Mr. Coffin?” he asked of his mate, who had just reported that he had obeyed his last order, and set the fore-topmast studding-sail. “I can't tell, sir; unless it is that the revenue laws that was talked so much about three months ago, are now the law o' the land, and this a king's revenue cruiser, wanting to overhaul us to see what we've got aboard as pays duties.” “That is what struck me when I saw the telegraph signal, ordering me out till night-fall, and then to run in and anchor on Indian Head here. But I can't stop now; I must run for it; for while I command this brig, no man shall bring me to, without showing better reason than iron balls! Keep a sharp look-out for the boats, and have the pistols and boarding-pikes all ready; for, by the beard of the Pope, I will not let any man come on board till he shows his authority, and—I approve of it!” “He seems to have done firing, sir,” remarked the mate. “That second gun like to have done us a mischief.” “If it is a king's schooner, all the mischief they had done should have been paid back to the owners from the king's coffers, or there would have been a fuss among the colonies! Is all her canvass on that will draw, Mr. Coffin?” “Yes, sir. She is going full six knots by the log! Do you see the schooner's boats?” “No, hardly. I wish they'd be kind enough to send up another rocket, and let me have a glimpse at them and their numbers. In my opinion, it is a regular revenue cruiser, and the law is down upon all owners ashore; and I have no right to let 'em take possession of the brig, without Mr. Frankland's leave.— He gave me command of her, and I'll keep her and her cargo for him, or die on her deck! There is my mind, Mr. Coffin!” “And I and the men will stand up to you, sir!” “I know they would!—” “Boat dead ahead, sir!” called the look-out on the bows. “How many?” cried the captain, as the mate sprang forward. “But one, sir!” “Brig, ahoy”' came loudly on the water in the stern tones of Mate Finch's boatswain-like voice. “Ahoy!” responded the mate, ri valing his hail in the deep base of its note. “Is that the Free-Trader?” “Aye, aye!” “Fling us a rope. Here is Mr. Frankland, the owner, wants to board ye!” responded the mate, as the boat shot past the brig's bows.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER IX. Captain Benbow, who, at the report of a boat ahead, had seized his pistols, supposing it to be one of those he had seen put off from the schooner, determined to resist, at the head of his men any attempt to board him in a hostile manner. But no sooner did he recognise the well-known voice of Finch, than he replaced his pistols upon the capstan, and said, joyfully— “Here is the owner, thank Heaven! Now I shall be released from the responsibility. Stand by and catch the boat and not let it drift past!” he called, in a loud and eager voice, at the same time springing to the gang-way. The mate of the brig was already there with the slack of the fore-topsail brace, which he dexterously cast into the boat as it came abreast of the forechains. Finch, dropping his oar as dexterously, caught it and took a turn round the centre thwart, and holding it for a moment till the boat came round, then firmly secured it. Mr. Frankland was the next moment assisted to the deck, by the hand of the captain, who gladly welcomed him. “Shall I drop the boat astern, sir, to tow,” asked the mate of the merchant. “Yes, Mr. Coffin. I shall remain in the brig till I see her safe in port!” “Mr. Frankland, you have come on board in good time, and welcome,” said Captain Benbow, shaking the merchant heartily by the hand. “I have been the last ten minutes wishing to see you, for I hardly knew how to act; for I have been twice fired into without any ceremony, by a schooner about a mile here to windward, and now she is sending a couple of boats to board me, I fancy; for I saw them put off from her ten minutes ago. Can you tell me what it means? Your signal on shore, which I obeyed, leads me to think there is something in the wind; but deuce take me, if I know what it is. I would have anchored below here, near the Indian Head, but for the guns this chap gave me; for I had given the orders to clear away the best-bower to anchor, when his shot came whizzing over my main-yard, which was the first intimation I had of having such a warlike neighbor. Can you tell me why you telegraphed me, and what this schooner means?” “It is the Gaspee revenue cruiser, Captain Benbow. She has just left Newport, no doubt, for the purpose of intercepting you; for you were seen to put back down the bay. I have news to tell you; there is a sloop-of-war in Newport, and there to enforce the new revenue duties.” “Then they are imposed, are they?” exclaimed the captain. “The mate guessed so; but I couldn't believe the ministry, foolish as they are, could have been so mad as to try to enforce these laws. It is the worst thing they could have done to make us hate old England from big to little. How long is it since they began to put the duties on?” “But six days. No vessel has arrived since the commissioners were put in office, save the sloop of-war and Gaspee schooner. You are the first merchantman; and the Free-Trader shall be first to try the new law. I am glad you were so fortunate as to discov er and make out my telegraphing; as if you had come up much farther you would have got under the Bixley's guns, and would have had to keep on. But I did not expect that you would be so soon followed down the bay by the cruiser. You have done right to stand on and not anchor.” “I thought you would bear me out in it, Mr. Frankland, though I always like to obey orders to the letter; but I saw there was mischief, and so resolved to push on for the port. Look sharp there to the windward. I thought I heard the noise of an oar rattling in a row-lock. Do you see anything of the boats, Mr. Coffin?” he asked of the mate, who had gone into the fore-top with the spy-glass. “I can see them now, sir,” he answered, in an eager tone. They are just for'ard o' the beam, sir, and not two cables length off.” “I see 'em,” answered the captain in a resolute tone. “Which way, Captain?” asked Mr. Frankland. “Oh, I have them, now!” “And hear them, too. Call all the men to to weather gang-way and give them their pikes and pistols!” cried the captain. “You mean we shall resist them, Mr. Frankland?” “Yes, if they attempt to come on board with violence, or there should be a king's Commissioner with them, for I learnt just as I was leaving my home that Mr. Riverton, the chief officer of the revenue had gone on board the Bexley. In that case he may have come down in the schooner and be in the boats, for he is very officious in his new office. If we let a commissioner touch the deck, the duties are the king's from that moment. My purpose is not to let one of them on board till the cargo is safely out.” “But if there is no commissioner in the boats, shall I let them come alongside?” asked the stout captain, as he grasped his trumpet and leaped into the main rigging ready to hail. “We can't very well get possession of the brig again, and they will keep her till they put a custom-house officer on board, so I think we had best, in order to secure the cargo, to refuse to let the boats come alongside.” “As we are running now at full six knot, if the boats were a little further off, we should drop them astern; as it is, they will just about meet us.” “They come on very fast,” remarked the merchant. “Can you tell if there are many men in them?” “They seem to be crowded. Luff a little, helmsman! Mr. Frankland, I can run over them, I think, if you say the word.” “No, that won't do. Let there be no loss of life, if possible.” “Steady as you are! Now I will hail.” But he had not got the mouth of the trumpet to his lips before was heard the deep, stern challenge of the officer in command of the leading boat, which was now distantly seen fifty yards off, black with men, and pulling swiftly towards the brig. “Ho, the brig.” “Aye, aye,” responded Captain Benbow. Stand by, Mr. Coffin, and have the men already to repel boarders; and if the boat gets under the gang-way cut away the lashings of the spar. But wait for my orders first.” “Why don't you heave to, you infernal Yankee skipper. Back your top-sails and let me come alongside.” “I don't choose to heave to for every thing that I meet,” responded Captain Benbow. “What have you been firing at me for without provocation?” “Give way, men,” shouted the officer, in a voice hoarse with rage. “Run them aboard.” “You had better keep away. You have not told me who you are? How do I know but what you are pirates?” “We are from His Majesty's armed schooner, Gaspee, that lies to windward, and I command you, on pain of being sunk by her guns, to heave to.” “What do you want with me?” “That I will let you know. Pull hard, men. He wants to run past us. Stand by, boarders, to spring away. We will teach these confounded Yankees to resist a king's officer.” The boats which were now close upon the brig, and every instant being thrown sternward by her onward motion; for the captain still crowded sail and made a simultaneous dash for the gang-way. The officers threatened and encouraged the seamen, and the men shouted and rose to their feet at every stroke of their oars, while the two boats ploughed through the water with a loud roar of the water about the bows.— Lieutenant Arling was seen standing up in the stern of the leading boat waving his sword, and making gestures of fierce impatience as the boats rushed onward. “You had best keep your distance now,” called out Captain Benbow, in a stern and decided tone. “It will not do for you to attempt to board a colonial merchant vessel as if she was a Frenchman. We are determined to resist. I have no wish to kill any of your men; but as sure as there is a king in England, I will be the death of some of you if you touch the gang-way ladder.” “We had best hold back, and let the schooner's guns sink her,” said the officer of the second boat. “No. Board her!” shouted Arling in a resolute voice. “It may not be the Free-Trader,” resumed the other, his words being distinctly heard on the deck of the brig, as the boats came up. “This is the Free-Trader,” answered Captain Benbow, in a firm voice; “and you will come along side in a hostile manner at your peril. I repeat, we are prepared for you. Stand by to cut away that spar.” “Stern, all!” cried Arling, alarmed at the firm voice of the captain, and in the darkness unable to see what preparations had been made for his reception. He thought it better, therefore, to use moderation, rather than sacrifice his men, for whose lives he would have to answer to his superiors. “Stern all!” repeated the junior officer, in command of the other boat, and their motion was instantly checked, while not more than thirty feet from the brig's side. “Do you mean I shall come on board without resistance?” now demanded the officer, with difficulty repressing his rage, at the decision of the Yankee captain. “I do not, sir. My brig is in her lawful trade and sailing on her proper course. The first thing I have about my ears is a shot from your schooner and then another; and because I do not choose to back my topsail, you send boats to board me, as if I were a buccanier. Until I know whether it is safe to let you come on board, I shall defend my brig.” “I wish to put a king's officer o the customs on board.” “I can't take him. I know no such officer, who has any business here.— Keep away a couple of points, helmsman. Let us drop these boats astern. They are too near our gang-way.” The boats all this while were fast falling astern, though the men kept dipping their oars to keep them a-beam. “You had best let me come on board in a peaceable manner, Captain Benbow,” called out Mr. Riverton. “The law will sustain me and condemn you. Lieutenant Arling says, if you will let him put me on board he will draw off his boats.” “I would rather be deprived of the honor of your company, Mr. Riverton, than take you as passenger even for the three or four miles up to town.— Anything else in the world, but this.” “Your merchant, Mr. Frankland, would be very much incensed with you if he knew you refused a king's officer in this way. He will not bear you out in this conduct.” “Then I will bear myself out, good Mr. Commissioner.” “Give way, men, all. We are going astern, while this Yankee traitor is bandying words with us. Give way! and board all! Come, my men, the brig is a king's prize. Hurrah for prize money.” “They are coming now in earnest, Mr. Frankland,” said Captain Benbow; “if the wind hadn't lulled so, as it has the last five minutes, we should have left them a cable's length astern by this time. They'll come to it now. Shall we fight?” “Let them not come on board,” answered the merchant, quietly. “That is enough. We are in all, with the cook, eleven good men. We ought to be taken and pressed, every soul of us, if we can't prevent these two boats' crew from coming a-board.— Stand by, all, and keep the gang-way. Cut down or shoot down the first man that shows his head above the bulwarks!” The next moment, the leading boat was heard to strike heavily against the brig's side, while the men in them filled the air with shouts of “Ho, for prize money! Down with the Yankees.” The resolution of the merchant, even at this crisis, did not give way.— He was perfectly calm. He had fortified his mind with the consciousness of being the defender of a principle, the resister of oppression. If it came to that, he was ready even, to yield his fortune and life to the cause of the liberty of the colonies. He felt that unless brave men resisted the crown, the colonies would soon become a land of slaves. To admit the commissioner, would be to acknowledge his right to board his vessel; and he firmly determined, that he would oppose to the death his crossing the gang-way of his vessel, and the entrance of those who came with him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER X. The lieutenant of the Gaspee, now loudly cheered on his men to reach the gang-way, and the better to show them where to strike the brig, and to enable him to ascertain what force and defences the vessel had, he discharged a pistol, the flash of which revealed the captain and his crew armed, ready to oppose him. “This is likely to prove serious work, but we must not be out-done by these colonists in their opposition,” he said, to the officer in charge of the other boat. “Did you see that spar suspended over the brig's side?” cried the younger officer. “They mean to cut it away to fall upon us. I had best board by the main chains.” “Any way so that you get on board. I shall board by the gang-way myself! Oars! Seize your arms!” he cried, at the same moment, as the men raised their oars and dropped them lengthwise of the boat, as her bow struck the brig's waist. The men were on their feet in a moment, and the lieutenant, leaping forward, seized the side-rope with one hand to draw himself up, while he brandished his cutlass in the other.— But he had hardly thrown his weight upon the rope, ere it parted at the top and he fell over the side into the water. At the same moment the lashings of the spare top-mast, which Captain Benbow had suspended over the side, were cut by the mate. The heavy spar fell with all its weight upon the boat, and striking it with its end upon the quarter, stove it so that it immediately filled. The crew, with cries and execrations, were plunged into the flood, while the boat sank beneath them, leaving them to swim for their lives. Some of them grasped at the iron supporters beneath the main chains, and others seized the gunwale of the other boat, into which Arling had already been drawn and which had got a hold upon the shroud with a boat hook. Others were carried past the brig which was still moving on under press of sail, and struck for the shore, which was but a cable's length distant. The destruction of his boat in such a summary manner with his own immersion filled the breast of the commander of the Gaspee with fury. He ordered the men in the boat to board by the chains and spring forward to lead them where the boat-hook, which alone kept the boat by the brig's side, was broken in the hands of the man who held it, by the force with which the Free-Trader dragged her through the water with her additional weight of men hanging upon her gunwales. The boat instantly fell astern and the brig shot ahead of them beyond recovery. Lieutenant Arling fired two pistols after her in his furious disappointment, and as he gave orders to row shoreward, to land the men that were clinging to the boat's sides, he swore that the brig should not be twenty-four hours longer afloat; and that if he could lay hands on the captain of her he should swing for it at the yard-arm of the Gaspee. “They have showed a pretty determined resistance to begin with, against the revenue law,” said the young officer. “I hardly thought they would dare to prevent a king's boat landing.” “Pull hard, men, and land these swimmers that are such a dead weight. We must back on board the Gaspee without delay. You lads that can swim cast off and strike for the shore.” Two of the eight men that were clinging to the sides of the boat, let go their hold and swam alone shoreward. The boat soon after reached water shoal enough for the rest to strike bottom, when they were cast off, and the lieutenant, saying he would send a boat for them, put about and ordered the oarsmen to row with all speed to the Gaspee. This vessel was just visible, about a mile off, but her position was distinctly pointed out by a lantern in her rigging, suspended there as a guide to the boats. It would be difficult to give a true picture of the deep, cutting disappointment which filled the breast of the young English commander, at being defeated as he had been, in an attempt to board an unarmed merchant-brig. “If it had been,” he muttered, as his boat bounded swiftly back to his schooner, “if it had been a buccanier or an armed vessel it would have been endurable; but to be beaten off and one of my boats sunk by a mere trader's crew, is enough to make me pistol myself; for I shall never hear the last of it. A fine report I shall have to make to Captain Petty, that with two boats and twenty-four men, I was unable to board the Yankee brig he sent me to look after.” “We did all we could do, sir,” remarked the passed midshipman; “if Sir William had been in command of the boats he would have fared precisely as we have fared. But I cautioned you against that confounded spar. By the light of your pistol I saw that it was not a fender, as you supposed it to be, but had been hung over the side to be cut away and fall upon our boats. Yet I did not believe they would have gone so far in opposing us.” “Gone so far. Unless the king has some score or two of those leading colonists hanged, they will go so far by and by, as to shut their ports to the king's ships, and take the colonies into their own hands.” “England could crush them with a blow,” answered the young man. “I will crush this infernal Yankee captain. As soon as I touch the deck of the schooner I will open my broad-sides upon him. Give way bravely, men. Let not the villain get out of reach of our guns before we can avenge ourselves. A few strokes more and we shall be on board. I am glad we lost no men, or the matter would have been more serious.” “All got ashore safely, sir; only Frost, had his head bruised by the spar as it came down. The men only saved themselves by leaping overboard, or others would have been hurt. The wind seems to freshen.” “I dare say—to help this brig along; but I will chase her till I blow her out of the water; and if she escapes me, the Bexley 'll finish her.” “If she knows what the matter is! But she will hardly know. We can't telegraph her in the night.” “Petty will understand that some thing is on the tapis! and hearing the firing and seeing the brig, if she is not sunk by our guns, before she gets up to the port, he will be sure to board her—if he can. Nothing would please me so much as to have him attempt it and be beaten off as I have been. It would make me the happiest man in the service. But they won't be likely to expect him, for they must be ignorant that the sloop is up the bay, or they would hardly keep on so steadily. See how the fellow crowds sail. He seems to be afraid of our vengeance.” “Ho, the boat!” suddenly hailed the officer of the watch on the deck of the Gaspee, which they had now got close aboard of. “Gaspee!” responded Midshipman Carrol. “Where is the first cutter, with the Captain?” Before any answer was given the boat was alongside, and Arling sprang on board. “Here is the Captain,” he answered in a bitter tone; “but the first cutter is in the bottom of the Bay! Send the third cutter with four oars to the main board at once, Mr. Carroll, and bring the crew on board!” “Aye, aye, sir!” “What has happened, sir?” asked the second lieutenant, who had charge of the schooner. “I heard pistols discharged and thought something was going wrong!” “Wrong! all went wrong! In a word, sir, the Yankee resisted us, cut away a spar, and sunk our boat alongside with it, and we were worsted, with half my men in the water. But they shall be paid! Pipe to quarters! Fill away and storm up the bay again! we must chase, and if we can't catch her, we must sink her!” All was now excitement on board the cruiser. The shrill whistle of the boatswain and the creaking of cordage and blocks, the noise of guns wheeled upon their coinings and of shot rolled across the deck as they were brough up from below by the powder-boys, combined with the rapid orders of the commander, which were echoed by the other officers, produced a scene of noise and confusion only to be seen on board an armed vessel just preparing to engage. The schooner was soon under sail again, standing northward on the same course, steered by the brig, which was still obscurely seen about a mile and a quarter, bearing N. N. East. The third cutter was despatched to the main, and ordered to pull after the schooner as soon as the men had been taken from the shore. Seeing the Gaspee at length fairly under canvass, and sailing at the rate of five-and-a-half knots, Arling gave orders to open his fire upon the brig, commencing with the bow gun, and firing aft each gun in rapid succession. The loud thunder of his cannon awoke the echoes of the shores, and heard at Newport, four or five miles distant, startled the citizens anew, for the two guns which he had fired at the brig an hour before to bring her to, hap been heard by the towns-people, and surprised them not a little; for it was not known that the Gaspee had gone down after night-fall. This second cannonading, which Arling kept up for about ten minutes very actively, until he had discharged four broadsides, filled them with apprehension and curiosity. The whole town was alarmed and agitated, and each one seeking information of his neighbor touching the heavy firing in the Bay below. “Master Kerrick,” said Arling at length to the quarter-master, who acted as pilot to the Gaspee, being familiar with the channel; “are we far below the deep water at the head of this shoal that separates me from the brig, which seems to have charmed spars!” “About two cable's length, sir, I should think; but we had best stand up pretty well before we attempt to stretch across, as there is a strong ebb tide, and we might be drifted, as the wind is light, upon the head of the shoal; and we should have to lay there till next tide!” “Keep a sharp watch, sir, and let me know just when we head the shoal; for I am in no humor, with an enemy under my lee, to run on this course a fathom farther than I have need to, to double the shoal, which I heartily wish was in the bottom of the Red Sea! Keep the lead going, sir, and be certain!” “The lead is going, sir; but the shoal shifts, and sometimes is twenty fathoms farther up than it is at others!” “You are the schooner's pilot, and ought to know your duty, so that you report when the vessel heads the shoal.” “I will do it, sir,” answered the master with a respectful manner; but he began to grumble as he walked away. “Mr. Carrol!” “Sir?” “I see you have your spy-glass at your eye. Have our shot done any mischief to the brig's top-hawser?” “She seems to carry everything aloft, sir, as before. But I can't see distinctly, as she is blended with the shore.” “She creeps in as far as she can, to keep out of the way of my guns. But it won't avail her. Cease firing, there, forward. Boatswain, wait my orders again. I am not to be laughed at also for firing a dozen broad-sides into a yankee skipper without touching a rope-yarn. We shall soon head this accursed shoal at the rate we are moving, and then we shall have the game in our own hands. The brig cannot escape us, let the Gaspee's nose once get pointed round this sand-bar, for we out-sail her three to two.” “Quar-ter-less-five,” sung out the leads-man from the fore-chains. “You keep away too much. Luff a point—we are shoaling!” said the pilot to the steersman. “We are near the head of the shoal, sir.” “Thank Heaven and the saints for that news!” answered Arling with fierce joy. “Six fathoms deep.” “That is better; are we high enough up to hall up and strike across?” “We are just at the head of the shoal, sir, but we must keep in a cable's length farther to get deep water enough for leeway. “Are we ahead of the shoal, sir? I want a short answer?” demanded Arling with haughty importance. “Yes, sir—but—” “Then brace up and haul aft fore and main sheets!” shouted Arling in a voice that rang through the schooner.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XI. The stern, impetuous orders given by the commander of the Gaspee, were obeyed by the officers and men, and the schooner changing her course from N. W. by North, braced up and stretched across the bay in a direction N. N. East directly for the brig. In vain the pilot warned him that, although the schooner had headed the shoal, yet on account of the strong seaward tide, it would be safer to stand on a few hundred yards before crowding after the brig. The impetuosity and anger of Arling were too great for him to listen merely to any means of caution. He saw the channel open and his enemy as it were within his grasp. He therefore resolved to risk falling upon the upper angle of the shoal, for each moment's delay diminished his hopes of avenging himself in his own way upon the daring Free-Trader.— Nevertheless, he did not wholly intermit proper care of his vessel, for on her safe passage across to the eastern channel, depended his hopes of punishing the brig. He therefore stood by the helmsman and carefully watched his steering, while he kept the lead constantly going. “Keep her away a little! More up, man!” he said repeatedly as the leadman's cry showed that the water was at times shoaling. “Four fathom lar-r-ge!” sung the helmsman, a moment after reporting six fathom less quarter. “Captain Arling,” said the pilot, very much agitated, “I am no longer pilot of the schooner, and resign to you my office.” “Very well. I will find one who is not so timid as you are, sir, to take your place,” responded Arling scornfully. “Go below, sir, and consider yourself under arrest.” “Very well, sir. But first I beg of you to keep the schooner dead away before the wind, as she was before, for a little while, the current just here, sir, is running like a mill-race, and I — Hear that, sir!” he cried, as the leads-man in a clear startling tone proclaimed, “Three fathoms and half short!” “I hear it and heed it,” answered Arling in a tone that sounded as if he was now satisfied that he placed his vessel in peril. “All hands to the sheets and braces! Let everything fly! Hard a lee! Keep her away dead before the wind!” he shouted in a voice of thunder. The schooner began to head off rapidly, and all was confusion and alarm, for the cry of the leadsman was now, “Three fathoms less!” The schooner drew eleven feet large, and every man felt that only a miracle could save her from striking upon the shoal, the head of which they knew to be close under their counter. There was a moment of anxious suspense, each one pausing to see if the schooner would counteract the force of the tide and stand up before the wind, to which her yards were now squared in order to force her away from the shoal. It was a moment of the most painful solicitude to Arling, for he saw that if the schooner struck, the brig would escape the fate he destined for her.— When the leadsman for the last time cried out that there was but two fathoms and a quarter, he saw that the schooner was fast drifting upon the shoal, and that nothing could save her. Yet he was about to order his boats ahead to aid her by towing, when there was a shock that nearly threw every man to the deck, the topsails flapped against the masts, which bent and sprung back like rods, and the Gaspee keeling over on her weather side, remained stationary. She had struck aft near the rudder, which was forced a foot out of its sockets, and swinging round lay with her beam hard against the head of the shoals. No sooner did Arling find his vessel had touched the ground, than uttering a volley of oaths, he dashed his speaking-trumpet upon the deck, and paced to and fro like a madman. The seamen in the meanwhile had been sent aloft by the second officer, to furl the two topsails and fore royal, for the idea of forcing her off was not harbored for a moment in the force of so strong a current, and it was necessary to ease the masts, which in clined at a sharp angle over the waters, and there was some danger, as the schooner was at all times crank, that she would go over. “It was your fault, sir, your fault! I will have you court-martialed! A pretty pilot!” said Arling furiously to the master. “I warned you, sir,” answered the quarter-master firmly. “You should have taken me out by the other channel, sir. Then we should have met the brig as she came in, and not have been on this bank, which may he devils confound! It is your fault. Here, sir, we shall have to lay till the next tide, if we get off at all! If you had known your duty, you would have taken us out by the same way the brig came in.” “I did not expect she would come in, sir, as we had supposed she run down he coast of the bay to land her cargo in the night. And these vessels with a leading breeze like this, usually come up by this passage. It is unusual for a vessel to go up that side of the shoal after dark.” “You might have known that a vessel that wanted to smuggle her cargo in, would take the most unfrequented channel.” “I take no blame upon myself, Lieutenant Arling; I warned you not to cross too soon, but give the outward tide a fair field; and when I found you would strike across, I resigned my position as pilot of the vessel.” “You shall not have the honor of resigning. You shall be broken, sir. See what a place we are in, sir; and yonder brig walking off with plenty of water under her keel, and her infernal Yankee captain laughing at us.” “Lieutenant Arling was right in his conjecture. Capt. Benbow was laughing at him, exulting in the accident which enabled him to escape his pursuer. With his night-glass he had been watching her, and when he saw her brace up to cross ahead of the shoal, he looked to see her strike upon it every moment. “She has braced up too soon, Captain Benbow,” said Finch, who was also watching her. “She will hardly clear the top o' the sand bar on this course! The pilot o' that craft ought to go to school!” The next moment, when they saw her heel over and become stationary, the announcement was received by all on board with a shout of joy, and no one was more pleased than Mr. Frankland. “We will escape her now! She must lie there till the next flood!” said Captain Benbow to the merchant. “By that time I think we shall have the last part of the brig's cargo safely stored in my store-house. It has been on exciting evening to us thus far.” “It is now eight and-a-half o'clock,” said the captain, stooping down to examine his watch, which hung in the lighted binnacle. “We will reach town in less than half an hour; and then there will be eight good working hours.” “With your crew and the crew of the New Englander, which is at the wharf ready to sail, we can unlade tonight.” “I fear you will be imprisoned, sir; and your brig seized as well as your cargo.” “Be it so! The news will go on the wings of the wind from one end of the colonies to the other, that a free-born American has been cast into bonds, and his goods taken, for asserting his birthright, and resisting the tyranny of the crown. I shall have the free, fiery thoughts of thousands of patriots for my chains, and the rich wealth of their sympathies instead of my goods. I have resolved from the beginning that the justice of this revenue law should be tested. I have wished it should be; and I, being the first who receives a laden ship under it, will not shrink, though I lose ship and life.” “If all men thought as you do, sir,” responded Captain Benbow, “those colonies would, in five years from now, be free of the crown, an independent empire in its own right.” “The day will come when this thing will be, my friend,” responded the merchant with emphasis; “it may not be while you or I live, yet something in public events and feeling tells me the time cannot be far distant.” “God grant, sir, I may live to see it,” answered the stout Captain warmly. “The schooner is like to stay on the shoal, sir,” said the mate, coming near where they stood. They have had to furl their topsails, she lists so heavily. She must be heavy aloft, with her two topsail yards; it is the first schooner I ever saw with two regular top-sails on fore and main too. Isn't it a marvel that only one of her shot struck us, sir, and that just knocking off the figure-head.” “It is, when so many shot flew whiz zing over and around us,” answered Mr. Frankland. “It is not easy to hit a vessel in the night, Mr. Frankland. They did well with their guns. I am thankful none of us were hurt.” “It is very ominous, sir,” said Finch venturing to put in a word. “What is ominous, Master Mate?” “The hittin' that figure-head, and knockin' it into a cocked hat.” “Well, it is odd,” said the Captain; “for it was a bust of King George III, you know, sir!” “It would have been more in keeping with a true omen, if you had knocked it off of one of the king's vessels with a shot,” answered Mr. Frankland; “still we must look upon it as a sign that the assiduity of the crown officers to execute the decrees of the king will result in his destruction, or rather that of his power in his colonies!” “A fair interpretation, sir! That is the meaning of it, you may be sure! How is the lead?” added Captain Benbow walking forward, for they were now rapidly approaching the town, and were near a portion of the channel where the navigation was intricate. “Ten fathom, sir!” answered the leadsman in the fore chains, as he gathered up his dripping line in small coils in his hand, ready for another cast of the heavy lead. “We are out far enough, Mr. Coffin. Now have all the light sail taken in one by one, and without noise, for we want to get up to town as quietly as possible!” “You need not think, Captain, we shall slip into the dock without being seen by the sloop of war! Do you see that light vessel with the water just forward of the fore-tack?” “Yes, I have seen it for some seconds past!' “Master Finch says it is the sloop's light, sir!” “Ah, then we will keep in with the shore as closely as the water will give us depth of channel!” “We can run within two topsail yards' length of the shore, sir, after we get on a little further!” “Take the helm, yourself; or rather give it to Finch; for he is the best pilot in the Bay! Master Finch, will you take the brig up if Mr. Frankland says so?” “I do say so. Take the helm, Finch! If the brig grounds, Captain Benbow, while he is there, I will bear the blame! He knows not only the channel well, but the exact bearing of the sloop of war!” “That is everything, sir! We are now within about a mile of her, and see! there open upon us one after another, the lights of the town. Now let every man do his duty promptly, and keep silence, as if he were running through an enemy's blockading fleet!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XII. The lieutenant of the watch on board the Bexley was slowly walking up and down on the starboard side of the quarter-deck, with a small spy-glass in his hand, which he occasionally placed at his eye and scanned the town and the dark shores adjacent, and the bay below. He would then resume his walk, whiling away the hour by humming the national air of “Rule Brittania,” in an under key. On the larboard side of the deck walked a midshipman and the purser, at a rapid exercising pace, and talking about familiar and dearly-remembered scenes in old England. The quarter-master, with his long telescope beneath his arm was in the waist level ing his glass at two or three fishermen's boats, as he made them out to be, that were putting off to return across the bay whence they had come in the morning, laden with fish for the market. There was a knot of two or three young officers gathered about the grey-headed purser, who was seated astride the gun next to the entering port, entertaining them with his adventures in foreign lands, for the purser was a famous hand at shooting the long-bow. In the waist, walked in parties of three or four, several of the non-commissioned officers and their mates, with one or two forward old seamen; and these were discussing the chances which the schooner was likely to have in overhauling the brig that she had gone down the bay after, and gravely questioning whether, if she was seized by her, the officers and crew of the Bexley would be likely to got a share of the prize money. Upon this subject there was a division, about an equal number giving it as their opinion that the sloop would share equally, as the Gaspee had gone under Captain Petty's orders; while the other half were very sure that all would go to the Gaspee's crew. Farther forward the watch were assembled in knots about the windlass and bitts, some listening to long yarns told in the good old-fashioned man-of-war-fashion; others singing interminable sea-songs to a lack-a-daisical tune, and others lay at length upon the deck in quiet repose, or paced the fore-castle with folded arms, and short pipes in their mouths. One or two were engaged in winding and greasing and putting in order one another's pig-tails, for at that period all tars wore queus. Just forward of the larboard entering-port, half a dozen marines in undress uniform were engaged in cleaning their muskets and whitening their belts by the light of a small iron lamp with oakum for a wick. The ship being at anchor and all the canvass furled, there was no active duties to attend to; and thus this state of quiet and idle pastime reigned throughout the ship. It was almost three quarters of an hour after the departure of the Gaspee from her moorings, and there was no expectation that she would be heard from again that night. Nevertheless, Captain Petty had given very particular orders before going into his cabin that the closest watch must be kept on the entrance to the harbor from the bay below, lest the brig, or some other merchant vessel might slip in unobserved. With giving the command, Sir William Petty left the deck, and exchanging his uniform coat for a dressing gown, he east himself upon a settee, and commenced reading for the tenth time his last London paper, which was dated three months back. He had been occupied about ten minutes in trying to get through a speech of a noble Lord against the colonies, recommending a standing army to keep them in submission, and had just got to dozing over it, in a state of half wakefulness, when he was startled by the report of the first gun fired by the schooner at the Free-Trader. His cabin windows being open to the cool breeze, and this blowing from the south, the sound was borne with startling distinctness to his ears, although the schooner was more than four miles distant. He sprung to his feet in surprise, for he well knew, except what his own ship and the Gaspee had, there was no ordnance in that quarter of the colony. The same warlike sound had reached the ears of officers and men on deck, and caused no little excitement and remark. “A gun, which, from the sound, a twelve pounder, has been heard from down the bay, sir,” reported the officer of the deck, opening the cabin door, as Sir William was putting on his coat; for he never appeared on deck except in uniform. “I heard it. How far distant was it, think you, Mr. Welford?” “I should think about four or five miles, sir. It was a gun, the size of those carried from the Gaspee!” “It is possible she has fallen in with the brig, or met another, and finding her restive, has fired a shot over her to bring her to.” “That is what I think, sir.” Sir William had no sooner come out of his cabin and ascended to the poopdeck, than he silently took his glass and examined the bay below. While thus occupied, a second gun was heard, and the flash distinctly seen shining up the sky, and showing between the black outline of the irregular shores that hid the schooner itself. “This is very strange, indeed. That is the Gaspee's firing, I think. But she can't have met with an opponent!” said Captain Petty. “No doubt the vessel he is trying to bring to has taken the alarm, and is running away again to sea,” observed the lieutenant. “It is likely, or otherwise I could not account for two guns. But I trust Arling will be discreet, and not take any rash steps.” “There goes a rocket, sir!” exclaimed three or four of the officers, as the curving line of the ascending missile flashed upon their vision; while the next instant the whole horizon was lighted up with the brilliant glare of its explosion, which, however, did not reach their ears. “Arling is in chace of some vessel, without question,” said Sir William.— “Go aloft with the glass, quarter-master, and see if you can look over the shoulder of land, and can discover any thing below to report!” “I can discover nothing, Sir William,” answered the old seaman. “The land looms up too much.” “I was afraid it would. If I have another gun, I shall send a boat down, Mr. Welford. Have the second cutter ready.” “Yes, sir.” “Quarter-master, report if you see any thing; and keep a sharp lookout for the flash of another gun or rocket. Send two good men, sharp-sighted lads, aft here, to keep lookout along the water. Mr. Welford, have your watch on the alert; for you may yet discover something; for whatever Arling is firing at, is more likely, with this port-wind, to be running up for the town, than standing off. So keep a constant and sharp lookout.” “It shall be done, sir,” answered the lieutenant, quite as earnest in the desire to ascertain the cause and end of the firing he had heard, as Sir William himself; indeed, the excitement extended throughout the ship, every man on board partaking of it. Martin Manwaring, the young seaman whom we left in chains, bound to one of the forward guns, had also heard the firing. It had roused him from a sweet reverie, in which his spirit was wandering over the scenes of the past, over the flowering days of his boyhood. He had been thinking how often he had rambled in the wild freedom of a child, along the rocky shores and green fields, which deepening twilight shut from his view. But in darkness and solitude as he sat there, memory brought them back with the fresh beauty of his youthful years. It painted before him his mother's cottage, a rural and picturesque abode, overgrown with woodbine and wild-rose, and the home of happiness and love. It showed to him his mother, all affection and tenderness, a fond mother and wise friend. He remembered how beautiful she was, and how her dark eyes beamed upon him like stars full of Heaven. He remembered her voice, so musical and rich; and sweet as it was in song, sweeter far it was when addressed to himself. All this passed before his mind's eye, as he sat there between the dark cannon, in chains and alone; and tears, at the recollection, filled his eyes. Memory still held the rein of his thoughts, and held them to the past and to his home; but it now brought the time down to later years, when the boy had become a youth, generous and impulsive, loving his mother above all earthly beings and fearing God, hating a lie with scorn, and strong in the integrity of truth and honesty. His thoughts were thus employed when suddenly the report of the Gaspee's gun fell upon his ears, and roused him to a sense of the present. At the same moment the young officer, Althorp, came up to him and said in an under tone: “How fares it now, Martin? Have you used the key?” “I have unlocked my fetters, sir, and am free;” he answered with grateful emotion. “You are very kind to me, Mr. Althorp, especially when you run such risks!” “I have resolved to aid you in escaping. The time is more than I supposed, for this firing below, I see, has set the ship's company occupied in wondering about it!” “What is it, sir?” “I can't tell; but it is no doubt the Gaspee firing to bring some vessel to. You must take advantage of the general excitement on the deck to make your escape; for at eight o'clock I cannot tell how it may be; I may be ordered off in the boat! for there is a second gun! It is possible that the Bexley may drop down the Bay to see what this firing is! for I hear Sir William Petty's voice on deck. This is your best time, Manwaring!” “I do not need any urging, sir, to secure my liberty! My heart bounds at the idea of being free! of once more beholding my mother!” “I trust you may find her alive and well, Martin!” “I pray heaven so, sir! It would be a hard blow to find it—it—was otherwise! It would be—” Here he stopped with emotion. “Never mind! You will, no doubt, soon see her. Let us wait a few moments till the men that are passing along deck are put to something. Then you must lower yourself out of the port here, and trust to your skill in swiming! Here is a line which I have brought for you to fasten to the gun carriage!” As the midshipman spoke, he drew a coil of strong cord from beneath his watch-coat, and cast it at the captive's feet. There was still a good deal of moving past the place where they stood, but in the darkness Althorp was unseen. The crew were grouping in various quarters of the ship, talking about the firing; and three or four men were nearer the place where the young sailor was confined than Althorp wished. “You must be patient; I will go and send these men to some other place,” he said. “And when you see them move, fasten your line, and dron through the port. You had best, when you reach the water, to swim along close under the counter, and when you get into the eddy stream, dive and swim beneath the surface as far as your breath will let you, so that the lieutenant of the watch nor the quarter-master may see you. Instead of making directly for the land I would strike down the river some distance till there was no danger of being seen from the ship.” “Yes, sir! I will do as you propose. There, the men have moved away! Shall I go now?” “Yes, God bless you, Manwaring!” said the midshipman, grasping his hand. “I will go to the quarter-deck, and if you are seen, try to turn aside suspicion. Wait till I am there, and then watch your opportunity and slip out of the port into the water! Success to you; and if you get safe ashore be careful to keep out of the way until the sloop has quit the port; for if you are retaken, you will fare badly!” “I do not love my chains well enough, sir, to wish to return to them; but I shall carry away with me one of the irons upon my wrist, for in endeavouring to unlock it the key broke, and I succeeded in parting the chain; but the manacle remains; and after I get on shore I shall present it as a memorial of British oppression! Good bye, Mr. Althorp! I hope we shall meet again under happier circumstances!” “I trust so,” answered the midshipman; and then leaving him, he hastened to place himself upon the quarterdeck, and near the lieutenant of the watch, speaking to each officer as he passed, that he might be seen by them to be aft when the captive should effect his escape.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XIII. The youthful prisoner waited after his friend left him, until he thought he had given him sufficient time to absent himself from the spot, and then taking up the cord he secured it by a double turn around the gun, and then carefully, without noise, let it down through the port to the water. The part of the ship where he had been chained was nearly pitch dark, it being under the top gallant forecastle, in which, near the open part of the deck, hung a bottle-lantern, which burned very dimly, and hardly sent its rays to the forward gun: there was also a stanchion near the lantern, the shadow of which, widening with the distance, completely cast the young man into shadow. He was, therefore, perfectly secure from observation while he prepared to carry out his plan of escape, unless some petty officer should come along with a light, or some friendly seaman come to talk with him to cheer his solitude; for this had been done during the day. But at that crisis, Martin Manwaring did not wish even the sympathizing presence of a friendly sailor. Having found, by drawing upon it, that the line was strong enough to bear his weight; for if it should part and let him with a splash into the water, he knew the noise would betray him to the watch; he, therefore, took pains to see that every means for his safety was secured. He was cool and self-possessed as was characteristic of him in hours of peril by storm, and in the uproar of battle; for all men in the sloop admitted that not a more courageous and thoroughly brave spirit had ever trod the deck of a king's ship than the impressed young colonist. He was well aware that he was about to undertake an enterprise, failure in which would cost him his life. He very well knew that the penalty for desertion from a king's ship was death; and that if he were discovered in the water, he would be fired upon by the sentries; and if not killed swimming, he would be hanged after being taken. All this he was aware of; yet, having freed himself from his chains and the way open before him, he resolved even at all these risks to make an effort for liberty. He felt that he was unjustly detained in the king's service, and had been iniquitously brought into it by impressment, and that he was doing his duty in leaving it. Under his circumstances, being a free-born colonist, he felt that desertion was no disgrace; but on the contrary honorable! Thus he had well considered and carefully weighed the subject; and he now proceeded to carry out his resolute purpose, with calm confidence in the justice of his conduct, and a firm determination to reach the shore or perish in the attempt. “Alive I will not be taken!” he said, with quiet decision; “but I trust that Heaven will protect me from my foes, and bring me once more to behold and embrace my beloved mother!” With this filial prayer upon his lips, he softly passed through the port, and firmly grasping the line in both hands, he rapidly descended into the water.— Here he hung an instant, his body immersed to his chin, to ascertain if his descent had been observed by any one; for there were three hundred men asleep and awake within the dark bowels of the huge ship. But all was quiet, or rather every thing indicated ignorance of his proceedings. He could hear the tread of the officer of the deck as he walked up and down, and the measured pace of the marine who stood 4 sentinel above the entering port; and the low murmur of voices of the men in conversation in various parts of the ship, about the firing and the rocket they had seen, with here and there snatches of a song reached his ears.— This state of things gave him confidence, and letting go the cord, he dove beneath the surface. He swam thus until he found he had got under the sloop's rudder, when he rose and caught hold of the iron band, and waited to decide what course to take from the vessel, wishing to choose that which would be the least likely to expose him to the glasses of those who were on deck. The sloop lay about a mile off, and a a little south of the town. The island that intervened was but half a mile distant, but to reach it he would have to swim against the tide, he therefore thought it best to follow Althorp's judicious advice, and swim down stream directly astern. He now distinctly overheard Sir William giving orders to keep a sharp lookout on the-bay below. This showed him the danger he would be exposed to by swimming down. Although a good swimmer and possessing confidence in his own skill and powers of endurance, he feared that even if he were not discovered as he should rise to take breath, he might possibly give out, especially as the receding of the shore of the bay below, would, if he went down far, give him at least a league to swim, before he could get under the land. While he was thus deliberating and hesitating, his eye fell on the life buoy, which was suspended within three feet of the water over the starboard davit. It was but the act of an instant for him to climb the rudder and with his seaman's knife sever the cord by which it hung. He let it drop into the water with a dashing sound, and delaying an instant to let the tide bear it some yards down, and long enough to hear the quick alarm cry of the officer of the deck, “What is overboard?” he commenced swimming up the stream towards the bows, close along by the sloop's side, and reaching the bow, he struck boldly out for the island, now diving and swimming a dozen yards under the surface, and now swimming with his head above water, but only long enough to take air. The noise of the uproar the fall of the buoy had occasioned on board, reached him, and urged him onward to secure his escape, aided by the ruse he had adopted; for it had occurred to him, as he hung by the rudder, that if he cut the buoy adrift, which in the water would look like a man swimming, the attention of all on board would be directed towards it, while he himself, if he struck out from the bows shoreward, would be unnoticed, especially if he swam a good deal beneath the surface. He therefore cut it away, as we have seen, a thing which he would not have done if he believed he could have got away from the sloop without attracting the attention of the officers, whom he heard enjoined to keep a constant watch on the water with their night glasses. This order led him to apprehend a failure, whether he swam down the river, or even quietly across to the town. He therefore adopted the bold expedient of giving a false alarm to the ship in the outset. The noise of the fall of the buoy was heard on deck, as if a man had plunged in, and the officer of the deck while calling out to know what it was, ran to the stern with others, and seeing the buoy floating down and bobbing in the rippling water, called out in a loud voice: “A man overboard! Man the cut ter!” “I suspect it is merely a log, sir,” remarked Althorp quietly, though his heart was throbbing with anxiety, for he saw the buoy and believed it to be Martin's head upon the surface. “It is probably a bucket.” “It is a man, sir,” cried the quarter-master, after levelling his glass at it. “No doubt a deserter!” said the purser, who was drawn to the stern with all the other officers. “Spring away the first cutters!” shouted Lieutenant Alford. The boat was soon manned. All was excitement throughout the ship, and every man who could get a chance was looking astern, while all were wondering and asking who it was. “Go forward, Mr. Althorp, and see if it is not the prisoner, Manwaring.” said the Lieutenant. “He is chained, sir,” said the quarter-master, “and—” “The infernal Yankee, Martin, has broke his chains, sir, and is off!” cried the boatswain, who on hearing the cry of “a man overboard,” bethought him of the young man, and at once hastening to the spot where he had left him, found that he had disappeared.— Without waiting to see how he had escaped, he ran aft, giving the report to his superiors. By this time the cutter had shoved off with four men and a coxswain. Althorp had volunteered to take command of her, resolved to prevent the boats finding his friend, but a young lieutenan had preceded him, and got into the boat first. He could therefore only hope for the safety of the brave youth, while with his spy-glass he kept his eye upon the dark object upon the water, as it was borne farther and farther astern by the tide. He wondered at the infatuation of Manwaring in keeping his head so constantly exposed to view, and was thus mentally censuring him for his imprudence, which seemed to him like bravado, when the boatswain made his report. Althorp now felt that there was no hope for his friend. The lieutenant had no sooner heard that it was the young captive, than he became highly excited that a young colonist should dare to escape from a king's ship. “Bring up three or four rockets, gunner,” he cried to this petty officer. “Sergeant of marines march aft; have some of your men, with their muskets, without a moment's delay! He shall be shot in the water, as he desires! To dare to escape! How did he get away. Boatswain?” “I have just been to see, sir,” answered the boatswain's mate, “and find he has broken one of his bracelets at the wrist, but the fetters are as good as ever, and left on the deck. He must have unlocked 'em some way; and besides here is a piece o' the signal halyard, sir, belayed to the gun and hanging into the water!” “Then he has had aid! We have traitors on board! Mr. Quigley, you should have placed a marine on guard over him!” “You did not order it, sir, and besides, he was so heavily chained!” “I will have this affair sifted! But he will not escape! The boat is fast coming up with him! Sergeant you need not fire upon him! I wish him to be taken alive!” “That is best, Mr. Welford,” answered Sir William, appearing on the deck. “We can then learn who his aiders and abettors are. We must know what traitors are among us!” “The boats are close upon him! We shall soon have him on board again!” exclaimed the officer. “He has taken his bath for nothing to-night.” “How imprudent he was to make such a splashing in the water,” thought Althorp, vexed, and not a little alarmed at the peril of his new position, if his part in the affair should be discovered. “But the more I look at this the more suspicious I am that it is he! He could not be so rash as to keep above water in the face of such danger. It looks more like defiance than discretion. Yet Manwaring does not want the latter. He is truly brave, but not a bravado!” “Now ignite the rocket, sir!” cried the lieutenant of the watch; and as he spoke the missile went hissing up into the sky, and exploding, illumined even the town, so that every house was visible for a moment. By its light the boat was seen about a cable's length astern, and close up to the object supposed to have been the head of the escaped sailor. Even at the distance the sloop was from it, it was easy to see that it was a buoy, and there was no need of the confirming shout of the lieutenant in command of the boat, who called out, “It is only the life-buoy, sir!” “And sure enough the life-buoy is gone,” exclaimed Sir William, looking over the stern to the place where it usually hung. “This is a great alarm about a small matter!” and thus speaking he returned to his cabin, sarcastically remarking, “You had best be sure, the next time, Mr. Welford, that your man is not a boy!” The boat paddled slowly back, while the officers and men laughed heartily, when Lieutenant Welford said keenly. “That was a buoy, it is true! but where is the prisoner, Manwaring? It is certain he is escaped from the ship!” “That is true,” remarked the officers, recalled by his word to the positive fact that a man had really escaped, and within twenty minutes past; for within that time the carpenter and gunner's mate asseverated that they had seen him chained between the guns. Excitement was thereupon alive again; and the officer in the cutter, as it came alongsitle towing the buoy, said the rope had been cut with a knife, and thus roused the curiosity of all anew. “Pull round the ship, sir,” commanded Lieutenant Welford, in a stern voice; “now close and examine the sides under the channels and bows and rudder. He may be hanging by some part of the vessel. It will be a disgrace to every man in the ship if he gets off!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XIV. There was one man on board the ship who saw the head of the swimmer twice rise and disappear beneath the surface. It was by mere accident that he looked shoreward, in the direction in which Martin was swimming, when all other eyes were directed astern at the buoy. He watched for a moment closely, till he saw the dark head disppear and reappear twice, with intervals of eight or ten yards between the two points, before he felt sure that he was the only man in the ship who really knew which way the prisoner was directing his escape. He, however, felt no disposition to betray his discovery, although he was a firm friend to his king, and to the service, in which he had sailed thirty years. He was the gunner's mate, and was considered one of the staunchest men for his country in the ship. But he had been sick, four months before, in the West Indies, and came near death, but Manwaring so faithfully attended him, that he recovered, and every one said that he owed his recovery to the unremitting kindness and attention of the youthful sailor. The gunner's mate felt that all men spoke the truth, and he became strongly attached to his generous benefactor. Between them in the long night-watches, there recently had arisen a good deal of warm but friendly discussion, touching the impressment of the colonists, and the oppressive rule of the king over his colonies. Bunter, though not quite convinced by his young friend's arguments, felt a ready sympathy in his own impressment, but nevertheless, gave him his advice, and recommended him to submission, and the quiet service of the king, now that he was fairly in for it. Manwaring, however, did not hesitate to declare to him that the law under which he was detained was unjust, and that he should the first opportunity leave the ship and the service. When, therefore, old Bunter's quick eye caught sight of the appearing and disappearing head, he merely shook his and muttered: “The lad's off! He has given them the slip this time, and while they are all chasing a buoy or log, he is safely striking out for shore. Well, I hope he may get there safe, and not be caught again. It may be my duty to report what I see, but if younger eyes and those whose duty it is to look-out don't see him, I have no business to see better than they do. They won't put me under arrest for it; so to make all safe, I'll let em find out themselves. But he is got out of sight now. Even their glasses wouldn't make him out now. I am glad to see the luffs over-done once. His escape 'll make 'em sore. Well, bless the brave lad! He has a hear as big as a whale, and I only wish him safe into port.” The officers of the sloop after search-about the channels and bows of their ship for the escaped bird, and examining every square yard of the water around with their glasses, came to the conclusion that he had drowned in his attempt to get off. This opinion was more flattering to their pride than that they should believe he had succeeded in effecting his purpose securely. The cutter after rowing about this way and that, at the orders of Lieutenant Welford, returned to the ship, having been engaged in her fruitless search full half an hour. The sloop-of-war had once more settled into comparative quiet, and an hour elapsed without any occurrence to disturb the repose of the decks, or to alarm the watch as they lounged about or paced to and fro in various parts of the ship. The lieutenants had talked over the affair and though vexed at having been foiled, they did not refuse to laugh at the spirted chase of the life buoy. With the true love of betting, characteristic of Englishmen, they speculated on the chances whether he had reached the shore or not, and laid bets upon them. Lieutenant Welford would gladly have distributed all three of the cutters at different points to watch the shore, but Sir William objected to it, giving as a reason that the boats might be needed. Althorp was delighted to find that the proposal of the officer was rejected by the captain, for being sure that Manwaring must be making the best of his way to the land in some quarter, he feared that he might be captured, if the boats were all ordered out. But Sir Willaim had had enough of the buoy for one night, and did not wish his crew to bring any farther ridicule upon the Bexley, by giving chase to any other phantom. How Martin could have got away from the ship, Althorp was at a loss to conceive; but that he had something to do with cutting the line of the life-buoy, he was very certain, but why he should cut it, and then not avail himself of it to help float, he could not conceive; for the idea that he should have severed it for any other object, did not occur to him. He was walking the deck, thinking upon the matter, and trusting that the young colonist would effectually elude all pursnit, when he was startled, as well as all others on board by the opening of the first broadside of the Gaspee upon the Free-Trader. “There is something going on now down below!” cried the quarter-master, with an oath of surprise. “Hear that, my masters.” “It is a regular cannonading. Five, six, seven guns in succession!” said Lieutenant Welford. “It must be the Gaspee engaged.” He was about to go to the cabin door to report the firing, which was very spirited and lighted up the sky almost incessantly, when Sir William Petty appeared in his dressing-gown and slippers, in too great a hurry to don his uniform coat. “What is all this, Mr. Welford?” he exclaimed in amazement, as the flashes of the Gaspee's guns illumined the heavens, and the quick report of the discharge reached his ears. “It is impossible to tell, sir.” “There is an engagement certainly.” “It sounds as if the firing was all on one side, sir,” remarked the quarter-master. “There is no mixed or confused discharges. I should think it was the Gaspee delivering three or four broadsides.” “But at what?” demanded the lieutenant. “That is the question,” observed Sir Willaim. “But we will soon answer it. Pipe away the crews of the two cutters, and let the men take their cutlasses, and have a dozen pistols put into the stern of each boat.” “Aye, sir,” responded the officer of the deck, and the shrill whistle of the boatswain already rang through the ship, and all was excitement and motion on board. “We have enough to keep all hands stirring for one watch,” said the purser, addressing Althorp. “It is nothing but alarms since we have been anchored in this confounded Newport. I shall be glad when we leave it.” “Let four marines be taken in each boat, and four seamen beside the oarsmen,” commanded Sir William. “Mr. Welford, you will take charge of the boats, and pull down the bay and try and make out what this firing is about.— You must be cautious, too, for there may be an enemy there, though no Dutch veesel would dare to venture alone up this narrow bay, knowing we have so many cruisers about. Be cautious, and yet pull on till you learn the cause of the firing. If the Gaspee is in trouble, you will use your discretion about advancing to her aid. Return or send back a boat and report to me as soon as you can find out anything.” The firing continued for a few moments longer, and then ceased, for the Gaspee had grounded. The boats were nevertheless ordered to proceed, and pulled away one after the other down the bay. Sir William, with his spy-glass at his eye, watched them until they were lost in the darkness, and then speculated with his officers about him, upon the causes of the cannonading. It was the opinion of the purser and quarter-master that the Gaspee had been firing into some vessel that refused to heave to. “I cannot believe,” answered Captain Petty, “that Arling would open such a fire upon a colonial vessel merely for not heaving to in the night. Yet from the firing of two guns an hour ago, and this heavy cannonading, I fear that he has done so. He is very headstrong at times.” “We shall soon learn, sir, all about it,” answered the officer of the deck. “The boats seem to be going down with the tide very fast as they left us.” The two cutters after leaving the ship, pulled down the bay at a rapid rate, the officer in command being desirous of coming upon the scene of the late firing with as little delay as possible. As the sloop lay out pretty well and they kept a straight course from her, they did not approach the eastern shore near enough to distinguish the Free-Trader, which was making her way up the stream close in under the land, and about half a mile distant from the boats. Lieutenant Welford was too eagerly looking down the bay, to give his attention to objects in shore and the brig had passed him so as to be moving on her way off his quarter, ere a lad of a midshipmnn, who was in the second cutter, and who had very sharp eyes which were always wandering restlessly about, caught sight of the brig. “Sail ho!” he shouted. “Where away?” demanded the lieutenant, in a quick tone. “Three points abaft the beam, sir.” “I see her,” answered Mr. Welford, as he caught her with his glass. “It is a square-rigged brig standing close in shore. How is it that she could have passed us?” “It is more than likely she can tell us something us about the firing, sir,” remarked the officer in charge of the second cutter which had now come up with the leading boat. “It is possible, sir. But we are too far below her now to reach her with this tide running against us. They will see her in the sloop and take care of her, if she is disposed to be refractory. We will row down for a league farther, at least, till we come to the place where the cannonading seemed to be. We shall probably fall in with the Gaspee on the way, for if this brig be running from her we must not be far behind the chase. Keep a sharp lookout on all sides, my men. A French crown-piece to the man that first discovers the Gaspee!” Mr. Welford was not a little vexed that the brig he had discovered, should have been passed unseen by him, but he did not like to display his annoyance to his officers and crew, and so passed the matter over lightly as he did. But he felt that the brig ought to have been boarded by him, for in his own mind he was quite well assured that it was she that had drawn the heavy fire of the schooner, for there was no doubt that the cannonading was from her, the calibre of the guns precisely answering to those carried by the Gaspee. He bit his lip almost through in his vexation at the brig's passing up with impunity, but he saw that it would be impossible to reach her against the tide before she would come to anchor in the harbor, and then, as she would be under the Bexley's guns, he trusted that she would be boarded by her at once, and his own negligence redeemed. The boats pulled on about a mile farther, when, as Lieutenant Welford had his glass at his eye, he discovered a boat coming up. At first, he could not distinctly decide what it was, but by silencing the bars of his own boats, there was distinctly heard the fall of distant oars. “It is a man-of-war's stroke, sir,” said the young reefer. “It is the Gaspee's boat then, without doubt. Something must have happened to her. Give way, men, all! Let us meet them.” The distance between the descending and ascending boats lessened each intant, and Mr. Welford standing up in the boat, was able to see that it contained six men, four at the oars, and two in the stern-sheets. “Boat ahoy!” “Ho, the boats ahoy!” simultaneously hailed both parties. “Bexley's?” answered Welford.— “Is that you, Arling?” “Yes, and glad am I to see you,” answered Arling, as his boat came up. “Have you seen the brig?” he demanded, in an eager voice.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XV. The earnest, fiery inquiry of Arling convinced Lieutenant Welford that the vessel he had suffered to pass him was a fugitive from the Gaspee, and the object of her cannonading; and for a moment he was too deeply mortified and angry with himself, that he did not reply. At length he answered, “We saw a brig in shore twenty minutes ago, but did not discover her in the darkness till she was three points abaft the beam. But if she has been at any mischief, Sir William will look after her, for we are all awake aboard the sloop; for we have had all sorts of disturbances! What has happened? We have heard a heavy firing, and are on our way down to see what is the cause of it! Sir William was fearful you had got into trouble. Was it your firing?” “Yes, and I wish that I had sunk the infernal Yankee skipper. It was the Gaspee's guns you heard! So the fellow even got up past you! Well, I am rejoiced at it from my heart! I don't feel half so badly as I did! It is some comfort to have you made a fool of by him as well as myself, Welford! Now I have got such good company in my bad luck as you are, I can look Sir William in the face without flinching; for in his eye, Welford, you are a pattern officer.” “Why, what has occurred? Why do I meet you here in your boat? Where is the Gaspee?” “To answer your last question first, Welford,” answered Arling, as his boat remained stationary by the side of the cutter, “the schooner is aground on the head of a shoal, a mile or two below here! and I am on my way up to get the Bexley to stop the brig; but, nevertheless, I am glad she got-by you; for I shall not be blamed so much! All will be laid now to the cuteness of this resolute Yankee skipper, for he has got the wind of us all tonight!” “Did you board him, or has he returned your fire, that you opened your broadsides upon him?” “It was in this way, for I shall never forget it as long as I live. Sir William ordered me to run out after the brig he had seen tack and stand off just befor dark, as he suspected she intended to run down the coast to land her cargo!” “And no doubt she would have done so, if you had not followed her,” remarked Welford. “Not she! It seems she only stood out to run in again at night; for I had not got down four miles before I discovered her about a mile distant, just forward the beam, and standing in, under press of sail. I was not sure that it was the same brig, but still I resolved to bring her to. My pilot Bunter, took me down on the west of the shoal that divides the two channels, and I now found I could not reach the brig without doubling the shoal, and making a long chase of it. So I fired a shot across her bows to bring her to! But she didn't mind it, and I let her have another point blank! But she kept on, and I then sent up a rocket to learn exactly her position, and see if she was really a merchant brig, for I didn't know but what she might be of one of our own brigs of war by her sauciness. The rocket showed her to be a brightsided merchant vessel, and the same, I had no doubt, that I had been ordered to pursue. So I hove the schooner to, and manned my boats, and pulled across the shoal to intercept her and board her. But when we got within hail, the fellow refused to come to, and threatened to defend his brig if we attempted to board! You know I am not the sort of man, Welford, to take a menace of that kind quietly. I ordered my two boats to pull for the gangway, and we dashed towards the brig with loud shouts. But I had no sooner touched her sides than the villains cut loose a spare top-mast that they had previously hung over the side! It came thundering down upon us, stove my boat, and pitched all my men into the water, when I had got before them; for as I grasped on the man-rope to help myself upon her deck, it parted, no doubt half cut through for this end, and let me down into the water. This, no doubt, saved my life; for if I had not fallen, the spar would have struck me on the head!” “This is a most extraordinary resistance!” exclaimed Lieutenant Welford. “I did not believe any of the colonist captains would dare to take such a stand against a king's boat! How did you escape?” “You may well call it escape, for we were thoroughly worsted, which makes me so much gratified that the brig went by you as she has! I succeeded in getting into the other boat, and all my men either reached her or swam ashore! But they did not resist so much a king's boat as the reception of the commissioner; for when I told them I would be satisfied to put Mr. Riverton on board, they then replied, showing how systematic and deliberate was their resistance, that they had no objection to receiving the king's boat, and letting me come on board alone, but they would defend their vessel with their lives before they would receive the officer of customs.” “That, then, was the secret of their resistance! The colonists seem to be resolved on this matter! and what did you do with Mr. Riverton?” “That I can't say! In the excitement of our boat's sinking and making our escape, and getting the men to land, I never thought of him; nor till we got back to the schooner, (for we had to let the brig go,) he never once entered my mind, when all at once it occurred to me that we had not seen him since the boat was stove!” “I hope he was not drowned!” “It is possible he swam ashore! But he had been among us so short a time, and I thinking only of my men and officers in the general confusion, and they only of each other, he was forgotten. I hope the poor man reached the land!” “What was the distance?” “A cables' length!” “He may have swam to it! But he was fat and unwieldy, and I fear little skilled in taking care of himself with no ground under his feet! Sir William will regret this much!” “I can't help it, Welford! It was confounded luck all round. The Yankee has got the best of it; and he must pay for his sport! After I got on board the schooner in my remaining boat, I opened my broadside upon him, resolved to sink him, and gave chase to head him; but the Gaspee went upon the shoal while under full canvass, and there she lays; while he has run up safely, and even passed you! I am now on my way to see Sir William, and get his permission to board the brig, and place the captain and his crew under arrest!” “Of course! It is singular that he should have been so daring as to have resisted, well knowing he could not escape ultimately!” “Perhaps the fellow thinks the towns-people will protect him and his vessel against us!” “They would, no doubt, very willingly do it, if they could do it safely,” responded Lieutenant Welford; “but the presence of the Bexley will be sufficient to overawe them. The Free-Trader is ours, most certainly; and there is no question but that Sir William will put under arrest the captain, if not even send him to England on his trial. For his offence is a grievous one against the crown, and if he is not made an ex ample of in the outset, there will be no end to the difficulties we shall have with the Yankee skippers that choose to follow in his footsteps!” “As your errand down this way is finished,” said Arling, “turn back with me! I want to have this matter ended before sun-rise, or I shall be ashamed to look at it. I have sworn that I will not sleep till the master of that brig is in my hands! The Gaspee will have to lay where she is till the flood tide, for she is driven hard on. Give way, my men! We are drifting ourselves here three knots!” The order to turn back was given by Welford, and the next moment the three boats were pulling against the stream in the direction of the sloop of war, from which they were about one mile and a half distant, the twinkling of her stern-light being just visible. “Sir William will probably order us at once, as soon as we report to him, to take possession of her,” shouted Arling to the lieutenant; “and in that case I now claim of you the lead in the expedition! It is my right after I have suffered so much!” “You shall have it, Arling!” answered he officer, who was his superior in naval rank, although the former was for the time being in command of the schooner. Leaving the three boats pulling with all their strength in the direction of the sloop of war, we now return to the brig, which we left just entering the harbor, and within half a mile of the town. The two boats had been seen by Captain Benbow through his glass, and, as he knew the Bexley to be at anchor above, he suspected them to be her boats sent down the bay to learn the cause of the firing. “That will be all in our favor,” said Mr. Frankland; “for the fewer boats the sloop of war has the better for us! But they are probably only fishermen rowing down to corly on their fishing ground.” “No, sir! They are man-of-war boats, I can see that, and full of men; and they are pulling at a slashing pace down the bay. That is the reason they don't see us; and then we are so close under the land, that probably we are blended with it! Mr. Coffin, send up and have the royals furled!” “Aye, aye, sir!” “And then clue up the topgallant sails! We are standing up now, Mr. Frankland, pretty well towards the town!” “Yes, sir,” answered the merchant, who was walking the deck with his hands behind him, and maturing his plan of conduct. “Keep as far away from the sloop of war as you can, safely, with the depth of water!” “Do you wish me to steer the brig into the dock, sir, south of your wharf?' asked Master Finch, who was at the helm. Mr. Frankland deliberated a moment, and then replied with firmness. “Yes, Master Finch! There is no other course if I would carry out my resistance to the imposition of duties!” “You won't, then, come to anchor off the pier?” asked Captain Benbow. “No, but run directly into the dock, between the wharves, and lay along-side my store-house.” “Very well, sir! Shorten sail as fast as you can, Mr. Coffin, for we are running close in! Furl the topsails, and haul up the fore-course! We will run in with only the jib and try-sail set; these will give us way enough!” The brig had now got up opposite the town, and close in with the wharves towards which she was standing, under just canvass enough to give her headway. The town, with its lights in its windows here and there, seemed perfectly quiet, and wholly unsuspicious of the brig's arrival; but as they drew nearer the docks, Captain Benbow, with his spy-glass at his eye, reported that there was certainly a large number of persons on the end of the pier. “You are right,” said Mr. Frankland, “I can see them distinctly. Be assured they are my friends! It was understood between myself and four or five of my friends, that if they saw the brig coming in they were to take possession of the wharf, with as many friendly persons as they saw fit to give me aid! They were to close the gate at the head of the wharf to keep out enemies, but especially the deputy officers of customs; for if one should get his foot on board, the duties are the king's; for we could not well throw him overboard or hang him!” “Good evening, Mr. Frankland! I am really glad to find myself once more safely back to Newport! It has been quite a pleasant sail up!” If the deck had opened beneath his feet, and the ghost of one who had long been dead had appeared before him, the merchant could not have been more confounded and amazed than he was, on turning and beholding standing before him the commissioner of customs! He started back, and gazed upon him as the light from the companion-way shone full upon him, with feelings that it would be difficult to analyse. He could hardly believe his eyes, nor could Captain Benbow either, to whom Mr. Riverton was well known. But there he was, in his proper bodily presence, smiling and bowing, and looking quite as much pleased as they looked disconcerted. He was a little worse for his immersion, his nicely powdered wig hanging damp about his ears, and his whole wardrobe rather forlorn and half-drowned. “Is it possible, Mr. Riverton, that it is you I see on board here?” at length exclaimed the merchant. “It is, neighbor Frankland,” responded the commissioner. “It is my own proper person!” “And where, in the devil's name did you come from?” demanded Mr. Frankland, for the first time in his life using an expression strongly verging upon an oath.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XVI. The commissioner, after enjoying for a moment the surprise which his presence on deck had created, and feeling too much over-joyed at having secured his position on board of, the Free-Trader, to fear the consequences that might follow his showing himself, thus replied to the amazed inquiry of the merchant, “There is no miracle, sir, about it, unless it is a miracle that I was not drowned! When the boat which you sunk so unceremoniously, as if men's lives were of no more value than kitten's, wont down, I was thrown into the water with the rest, and should certainly have been drowned if I had known how to swim a little, for then I should have tried to have made the shore, and should certainly have gone to the bottom before I get on soundings. But not swimming, I had no sooner risen to the surface than I tried to grasp hold of the brig's side; but could get nothing to cling to, and was going under again when I saw the rudder, and I scrampled towards it some how and grasped it! There was an iron ring in it, which was the best friend ever I had. I held on to it, and after collecting myself a little, I found that if I exerted myself I could climb up into the cabin windows. I did for a moment think of calling to those in the boat to tell them I was there, and asking them to come for me; but the moment I thought of the cabin windows I changed my mind; for, said I to myself, here I am, having fairly effected a lodgment upon the brig, and I mean to make it sure, if I die for it! So I resolved to watch my time and crawl into the window of the cabin; for after having ran so many dangers to get on board, I did not feel like giving up the hope of finally ensconcing myself between decks. So, after all was quiet, I crept up into the cabin window and safely landed myself within; and there I have remained in a berth till three minutes ago, when hearing by your conversation that we were near the wharf, I thought I would present myself, as this is about the place in the harbour where a vessel coming in should take an officer of the customs on board!” “Shall I pinion him, Mr. Frankland?” asked the captain, in an under tone, and evidently chagrined, “I will deeply pinion him if you say so, and keep him prisoner below till the cargo is stored. No one knows he is on board, and no doubt the officers of the boat suppose him to be drowned! Give me the word, and I'll take care he don't trouble us till the brig is clear of the wines and sugars, the only dutiable articles!” “I have nothing to say against any course you pursue, Captain Benbow,” responded Mr. Frankland, in the same tone. “Then heave a-head! All is safe. Come with me into the cabin, Mr. Riverton, and let me show you my manifest; and give you also a glass of brandy and water; for your wetting may give you a bad cold. I am very glad you were not drowned! I should have regretted it very much; and trust that none of the seamen were lost or hurt! Come, sir, now you are on board we must take care of you as hospitably as we can. “I am glad you have thought better of it, Captain Benbow. I hope it won't go hard with you about resisting the boats, for we have been friends and neighbours in our day! I do think a little brandy wouldn't hurt me! It is rather chilly being so long in wet clothes! Come, neighbor Frankland, suppose you join us, and drink the king's health.” “I have no objection to drinking my king's health, Mr. Riverton, nor of yielding proper obedience to his laws; but I cannot submit to be treated as a serf, and as serfs the king is pleased to treat his faithful colonists. We have fought his battles against the French in Canada, taken for him Louisburg, and always shown ourselves loyal and true subjects. I never will refuse to drink his majesty's health; for though I love not his laws I respect his person!” “Come, Mr. Riverton, I can't be very long absent from the deck!” said the captain. “True. I will just look at your manifest, and see what you have got, and drink a glass and be on deck again. I am glad this matter, friend Franklin, has ended so quietly. The king will have his duties on your cargo, and you will sleep with a good conscience after paying them!” With these words the commissioner, little suspecting the trap that the angry captain was laying for him, followed him down into the cabin. “Here is where I keep my wines, Mr. Riverton,” said the captain, opening a locker beneath the companion-stairs. Just look in and see what a cool place!” The commissioner stooped to comply, when Captain Benbow, with a strong grasp upon his two shoulders pushed him into the closet, and clapping to the door locked it, and rolled a half pipe of wine against the door. “There, you will be safe there, my man, till I choose to let you out again!” muttered the captain, with an emphatic manner. “For the love of mercy! Help! help! Murder! help! Treason! Let me out! Oh, murder!” were cries that proceeded from the terrified and surprised officer of customs. “Silence, or I will blow you up with a cask of powder that is close by your door!” cried Captain Benbow. “So let me not hear your voice till I am ready to let you out! You came on board without my consent, and you must stay here without your own. Keep quiet, is all the caution I give you, master Riverton!” With these words of menace, the captain left him, and hastened on deck. “What have you done with him,” asked Mr. Frankland eagerly. “Locked him up! He is safe enough, and frightened out of his wits! Now I am ready, sir, to attend to your directions!” “Only to bring the brig alongside the pier as expeditiously as possible, and when she is secured to open your hatches and break bulk. It looks odd to see a merchant compelled to steal his own goods out of his own vessel, to save being robbed of them by the king! I am conscientious in what I am doing, Captain Benbow!” “We are pretty well in now! another cable's length and we shall be abreast of the end of the pier! What is that, Mr. Coffin?” “A boat, sir, coming from the wharf! Ho! the boat!” “Birchell, the tide-waiter! Throw me a rope, for I'm coming aboard in the king's name!” “Here is another of them!” cried Captain Benbow, “shall we sink him?” “No, we have his principal here, and that is enough,” annswered the merchant. “But he must be prevented if possible; but use no violence, or there may be a commotion in the crowd who are looking on! Let everything be conducted as quietly as may be now!” “We have no spare ropes, Master Birchell,” responded the mate, as the collector's boat, with but one person at the stern-wheels and two oars, went under the bows with a rapid movement. “I must then get on board as I can,” answered Birchell resolutely. “Don't harm him, Mr Coffin, but keep him from getting hold. He is a hard-faced, resolute fellow, and will prove a harder customer than the commissioner!” While he was speaking there was a cry of surprise forward, and “He is aboard!” reached their ears. “Yes, indeed, I am on board, and I mean to stay here, Captain Benbow. Glad to see you home again! I knew the Free-Trader as soon as she began to appear in sight, ten minutes ago! Ah, Squire Frankland, your humble servant, sir! I am happy to be the first man on board the first craft that has come into port under the new law! You have plenty of sugars and wines, hey!” “You are welcome, Birchell!” answered the captain, not a little annoyed. “If I ai'nt it is not my fault. I caught the brig's martingale as she was passing and throwing myself on her bowsprit, was upon the forecastle in a jiffy. Did you see anything of an armed schooner below?” he asked significantly. “Yes, we left one aground on the shoal, four miles below! But walk into the cabin, Mr. Birchell! I have some capital brandy!” “To be sure! Right from the fountain, where it flows, in the West Indies! I never refused a good offer, yet. I'd like to take a bottle of it home as a present, after I see the brig unloaded and all your freight entered to-morrow, 'cording to law!” “Mr. Coffin, take the brig up to the wharf, and get every thing snug al oft and open the hatches. Mr. Frankland will have men to help hoist out the cargo. We have a hard night's work before us, and you must be lively with the men. I am going below to lock up this blustering tide-waiter. Come, Birchell,” he added in a louder tone of voice to the deputy officer. “I'm there, captain, I am,” responded Birchell, and with a swaggering air, for his successful boarding of the brig, which certain people in town prophecied he would never see the inside of until she was unladen, had elated him, he followed Captain Benbow into the cabin. “Nice, comfortable cabin you have, here, captain, real nice snug box, for a single man,” said the tide-waiter, looking about him. “How many days from Madeira?” “Forty, to-morrow.” “Good passage, very. And how many did you have from the Havana to Madcira?” “Half as many,” answered Captain Benbow politely, as he opened a case of spirits and drew forth a square gilt bottle, labelled “French Brandy,” in gold lettering. “Ah, that is the kind for weak eyes, Benbow,” exclaimed Birchell, his eyes snapping at the sight of the rich ruby tint, as the captain held it up to the light. “You have a taste in selecting the best, Captain. How much duty think the brig 'll pay the king on this venture?” “Well, we may have about thirty thousand dollars in wines and sugars in the hold,” answered Benbow, pouring out half a tumbler of brandy into a glass, into which unseen by the tide-master, he had previously poured a large dose of laudanum, enough to produce sound and long sleep, but without danger.— “There, Mr. Birchell, try that! You will find some loaf sugar there before you.” “I never dilute, Captain. Here's to his majesty's health, and a long life to him. Your health, Captain Benbow, and luck to your brig.” With this miscellaneous sort of a toast, Birchell, who was slightly tipsy when he came on board, drunk off the potion. “Capital brandy, but it seems to me it has a taste of—of—what is it?” “Perhaps there may have been a taste of camphor in the tumbler.” “That is it. Nevertheless, it was capital liquor.” “Take a clear glass and try some that has no smell of camphor,” said Captain Benbow drily. “Well, I think I will,” responded Birchell, as he received a second glass, without any foreign mixture from the captain. “But you don't drink.” “I will pledge you sir.” “Here's luck and a rich voyage next time out,” said Birchell, as he tossed off the brandy. “Ah, that is the nectar! No camphor there, Capting, I'm blessed if there is!” and with an expression of very high satisfaction upon his countenance, he replaced the glass upon the transum. “I suppose you would like to see my manifest, Birchell?” asked Captain Benbow closely watching his face to see the effect of his stupefying draught. “Yes, I don't mean you shall get off without paying every penny of the duty. I am a king's officer, I am, and I must do my duty, and my duty is to look after your duty, hey? Yes it is. Your brandy is confounded strong, Benbow. It is busty strong! Fourth proof eh?” and Birchell's eyes looked heavy, and he soon sank upon a camp stool. “It begins to do it for him,” said Captain Benbow o himself. “He will soon be quiet enough.” “B—B—Ben—bo—bow!” “Well, Birchell.” “I am a kin—kin—king's officer, I am. Keep my eyes open for me!— Strong br—br—brandy, Benbow, it is. I say, Benbow, I say, I'm a ki-king's—” Here the tide-waiter, whose senses had been each moment yielding to the influence of the laudanum, fell over and rolled upon the cabin floor in a state of stupefaction. “There he will lie sound enough until morning, when I will have the hog hoisted ashore, and the king may take him for duties.” “Captain?” called a faint voice from the locker, “Captain, I'm smothering.” “There's plenty of air there, Master Riverton. You must be quiet. Remember my threat!” and with these words Captain Benbow ascended to the deck, locking both of the cabin doors, and drawing the top of the companion way over, so as to prevent all intrusion below.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XVII. When the captain of the Free-Trader reached the deck of his brig, he found that she was close up to the wharf, and that men were busily securing her to the wharf posts. Above him rose the walls of Mr. Frankland's store-house, and the pier head was dark with a crowd of not less than one hundred men. “He is dead drunk, sir, and fast asleep. I've fixed him for to-night,” were Captain Benbow's words, as he passed the merchant, who was talking with a citizen upon the wharf, who carried a lanthorn in his hand. “The people now on the wharf are all our friends,” said the merchant to Mr. Frankland. “We have had charge of the gate above, and admitted none others; and, indeed, the majority of the town are on our side. But you can do nothing, sir, with the Bexley at anchor so near.” “The Bexley will hardly open her batteries upon us in the night, with the town in range. If she sends her boats, we must do the best we can with them. We have already resisted successfully an attempt of two boats from the Gaspee to board us, and in return we were cannonaded, but in the darkness escaped, and have succeeded in reaching port.” “The whole town has been in a state of excitement about the firing. Things have come to a crisis at last. Where is Birchell? Didn't he get on board? He tried to come down on the wharf, but couldn't pass the gate, and so went round, and with a custom-house boat pulled out to board you before you should touch the pier. I thought I saw him get on board.” “He is here, but will hardly trouble us,” answered Mr. Frankland. “How many men have you on the wharf willing to work in unloading the brig?” “Every man of them, old and young, I believe would turn to. But the Captain is getting ready to go to work, I see.” “Off with the hatches, Mr. Coffin,” cried Captain Benbow, “and rig the tackle for hoisting out. We must be lively.” “You see we are resolved sir,” answered Mr. Frankland. “But the Bexley's boats will be here ere long.” “We shall continue to work till they do come, and then we must keep them out of the brig. There are men enough our friends, to overawe any party that would approach us from the sloop.” “But are you really going to land your cargo in the face of this ship-of-war, Mr. Frankland?” cried another merchant coming on board. “It is madness!” “I shall make the attempt. In landing my cargo I am only doing what I have a right to do.” “But the consequences, sir.” “I leave consequences to take care of themselves. I am acting from a high principle, sir.” “The brig and cargo will be forfeited, and you will be imprisoned!” “I shall do all I can to prevent it.” “I see lights moving quickly here and there about the sloop's decks; you may be sure they will send their armed boats.” “I do not fear them. There are at least five hundred men on this and other piers, if I can judge of numbers in the dark, and of these I know most are opposed to the revenue laws, and will see me out in any resistance I may make.” “Resistance without arms?” exclaimed the merchant, with surprise and doubt. “Yes, sir. Do not be amazed, Mr. Farly, the day is not far distant when the colonies will fly to arms from the north to the south to resist the oppression of the crown, of which these laws are but the beginning” “You will lose your head, sir, to attempt by force to oppose the king's boats,” said the same person. “The Bexley will be sure to open her broad-sides upon the town, if any of the people engage with you to resist their boats.” “Mr. Frankland, all is ready, sir, to begin to hoist out the cargo,” said Captain Benbow. “We only wait for your store-house doors to be opened.” “Which they shall be without delay,” answered Mr. Frankland, leaving the gentlemen, and stepping upon the pier, upon which his stores stood.— In a few moments he had unlocked the doors, and when the people by the light of the numerous lanthorns held by persons in the crowd and hoisted in the rigging, saw them open, they shouted aloud, and filled the air with “Three cheers for Mr. Frankland! Down with the Revenue! Hurrah for the Free-Trader and Captain Benbow.” “I wonder where the officers of the customs are?” observed the town clerk, a warm tory, bustling about the deck in his silver laced chapeau and gold headed stick. I don't see either Mr. Riverton nor even the tide-master. Things have come to a pass! Stop, Captain Benbow, I forbid in the king's name, landing any of this cargo!” “Mr. Clerk, I advise you to leave my brig's deck, sir,” replied Captain Benbow, resolutely. “You may happen to get a cask of wine on your head, or a box of sugar on your toes. You will find safety in discretion to-night.” “Out with him! Hussle him overboard!” cried several rough voices.— “We want no king's men here tonight!” “Down with the tories! No king's revenue for freemen!” shouted a hundred voices on the wharf. The crowd each moment increased, and became more and more resolute and patriotic in their hatred to the new laws. The lanthorns, as they glowed upon the masses of human faces, showed men aged and gray-haired, leaning on their staffs, middle aged men with stern visages, armed with stones or bludgeons, and some even with firelocks, and lads even of tender age. Every face bore an expression of resolute defiance, and that earnest, enthusiastic look, which can only proceed from the profoundest excitement. It was a singular and wild scene, and as Mr. Frankland glanced his eye for an instant over the glare illumined faces of six or seven hundred persons all moved by one spirit, and actuated by one feeling, and as his ears caught the deep murmurs of approbation that broke from them, as pipe after pipe was hoisted from the hold and swung by a score of strong and willing arms into his store house, he trembled at the power he had been instrumental in setting in motion, while at the same time he rejoiced in the love of freedom so clearly manifested by them at such a crisis. He turned to the timid merchant who had been speaking of the Bexley's boats and fearing them. “Look at those men, old and young, and see if you think I have anything to fear from the Bexley, though she should send all her boats with a hundred of her men. There is a power in those masses that they would not dare to provoke, by attempting to board the brig.” “True, Mr. Frankland, but though you might prevent their coming on board to-night, you will suffer to-morrow.— The sloop will certainly open with her guns upon your brig and store-house, for these are all that will be in range of her shot. You will certainly lose your vessel, and perhaps your life. My advice to you is, that if they come, you let them place on board Mr. Riverton, the commissioners, and—” “And so virtually acknowledge the right of the crown to take tribute of the colonies! No, no, sir; and besides Mr. Riverton is not on board the Bexley.” “Heave-he-yeoh! Sing cheerily ho yeo! All together, pull boys, yeo-heave-ho!” Thus loudly rang the voices of the men at work, and with astonishing celerity pipe and cask, box and bag were hoisted up and swung into the large door of the store-house. Every ten minutes the gangs were relieved, for men rivalled each other in their desire to show their patriotism and detestation of the crown laws, by lending a hand to the fall and assist. There seemed a spirit of haughty defiance and contemptuous indifference combined by the near vicinage of the sloop-of-war! The men who labored at the fall, appeared to give out their voices as if they desired that they should be heard on board the Bexley, for all hopes of performing the task of unlading the brig, which Mr. Frankland had contemplated in the outset, without noise or observation, were out of the question; inasmuch as all the town were alive, and boats containing friends to the revenue had no doubt put off to the sloop to report the proceedings. So he made no attempt to enforce silence; and in his heart rejoiced that the English officers could have now an opportunity of seeing demonstrated the unpopularity of the law with the people; for it had been published in England that only a few of the more opulent merchants would oppose it, while the masses would gladly see it imposed. “The proceedings of this night,” said Mr. Frankland, as he stood near Captain Benbow watching the people at work, “will show the ministry that it is not safe to try the experiment of seeing how free-born men will wear a yoke. I do not shrink from any result of my conduct, captain, and am ready to stand in the breach. But with you it is different, and your crew. Your presence is no more needed on board, and your family claim your attention. You have faithfully served me and shall have your reward. There is no doubt that you will be aimed at particularly for resisting the two boats!” “I am willing to be the target then!” answered the captain, stoutly. “But I am not willing you should be. You acted under my orders; but it is not known I was on board at the time, save by the commissioner, and I will risk his report. My wish and advice is, for you to take the brig's yawl and put into it what you wish to take home, and take all your crew with you, not leaving a man for the English captain to inflict vengeance upon. In four or five hours, at least by sunrise, you can reach Bristol. There remain secretly with your family till you hear from me. I do not wish evil to come upon you. Your crew are now no longer wanted, as their place is taken in discharging the cargo, by my patriotic townsmen, as you see; volunteers from whom are so numerous, that they are even in each other's way! No objections, for I will not hear them!” “But it looks so like skulking!!' “It is my command! you must obey it. No one would ever question your courage, captain. You owe it to your men to try and save them. I and my friends here can look after the brig's safety. As soon as it will be safe for you to return to Newport, I will send you word. A few days, at the most, will put an end to the merits of this present affair. In a week's time, perhaps, certain the worst will be known that is to be. Now order the yawl round at once; for the Bexley's boats may be here and blockade you!” “I expected them to be here before this, sir; and therefore I am positive it was them I saw pulling down the bay toward the Gaspee!” “So much the better for us! I have spoken to Mr. Coffin, who is ready to second my wishes and go with you.— He is now collecting the crew!” “Well, Mr. Frankland, I have no more to say. I dare say it is the best course for me; and, as you say, I can be of no more service on board, now that the brig is at the wharf and you are here to superintend. So I'll be off; for, to tell you the truth, I shall be very glad to see my wife and children! I must go into the cabin to get my clothes and some little presents I have got for the little folks at home: and some other things I wish you would have taken out by some men you can trust and put in your counting-room to keep for me; for if they should take the brig, I would not like to lose them!” “I will see to them all!” “And I leave Birchell, also to your care. I gave him at least half a wine-glass of Iaudanum in his brandy. The liquor will keep it from hurting him; but he will not wake for one while. I would let him lie where he is. Then there is the commissioner in the locker!” “I'll take care that he does n't get out,” answered Mr. Frankland, smiling at the manner in which the captain made these communications. Captain Benbow then went into his cabin, where he found the tide-waiter, Birchell, still upon the floor in deep sleep. He did not disturb him, but packing up the articles he wished to take with him, he placed them within reach of the cabin window. “Captain, my dear Captain Benbow!” called out the commissioner from his hiding-place, “I am nearly perished for air and room to move my limbs!” “You should not have made yourself so officious, Master Riverton! Good night. When the cargo is out you shall be let out, not before!” With these comforting words, Captain Benbow returned to the deck; and in five minutes afterwards he had got into his boat with his mate and eight men, and with what bundles they could make up on the spur of the moment. Taking leave of Mr. Frankland, he dropped astern, and delaying but for an instant under the cabin windows to take into the boat the parcels he had placed there, he gave orders to push off and row up against the stream past the town. The night was starry, and a seaman could make out a boat on the water, even at the distance of the Bexley; but nothing met the eye of the captain, as he keenly surveyed the space between his boat and the sloop, to indicate any movement on her part towards ascertaining the cause of the excitement in the town; for he was certain the numerous lanterns on the pier, and the shouts of the people must have been noticed on board, even if the brig herself had not been seen to arrive and enter the dock. He could only account for their apparent indifference from the fact that her boats had been sent down the bay; and thus he was confirmed in his affirmation that those which he had seen were men-of-war barges, though pronounced by the less practised eye of Mr. Frankland to be fishermen.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XVIII. Leaving Captain Benbow and his boats' crew pulling up the bay towards Bristol, to avoid the consequences that might follow the firm and bold resistance he had made to the Gaspee's barges, and leaving the brig in the hands of the towns-people, who are discharging her eargo with such patriotic zeal, we will return to the youthful seaman, Martin Manwaring, whom we left swimming for the shore after his escape from the sloop of war. We have seen with what success his perilous and bold ruse was crowned, securing his safety by what at first seemed to threaten it. Finding that the whole attention of the officers and men were directed astern to the buoy, which he had, with great self-possession cut loose, he felt that he should escape without being discovered. With strong arms and much skill he combatted the current, endeavoring so to direct his course as to reach the island, and there rest and take breath before he proceeded to the main-land. But he found the tide too strong for him to swim against without exhausting the strength which it became him to husband; for he had a long and arduous swim before him. Therefore, he gave up the idea of reaching the island by stemming the tide, and resolved to strike out at his ease, and rather with the current than against it, trusting he should at least reach the shore not a great ways below the town. The sloop at which he had been a prisoner was fast blending its masts and yards with the darkness as he swam on, and soon he could only faintly discern the dark mass of her hull resting in the water like a huge rock. He at length could only tell her position by the lights on her deck. The explosion of the rocket had alarmed him for his safety; for he felt convinced that if they threw up several he would be likely to be discovered. He, consequently, swam a great deal beneath the surface; till at length he began to experience great fatigue. Upon this he ceased his exertions, and throwing himself flat upon the water, he floated for many rods with the current. He had to resort to this method of resting himself four or five times, which caused the tide to take him down the bay almost as fast as he swam landward. At length he rejoiced to find himself near the shore, for he began to feel that if it were very far distant he should be unable to reach it.— His arms had now become so tired that he began to think he had undertaken too much in attempting to reach the land from the ship; but inspired with the hope of liberty, and above all with the hope of once more seeing his mother, he took heart and pressed manfully onward towards the shore, on which he could discern even the trees and shrubs relieved against the star-lit sky. “I shall soon be there,” he said, as he swam onward with all his remaining strength; “I shall soon behold my mother! Courage! The shore is not far!” And again he pressed onward; for he saw that he was now just above a projection of the shore, and that if he drifted past it he should hardly gain the land; for below the point the shores receded. But ere he got near it his strength was almost gone. He could no longer move his arms with the confident sweep and athletic form with which he started from the ship. He found his head submerged several times from exhaustion, and at length he found that he could scarcely keep his head above water. Still he struggled on, sometimes breathing heavily above the surface, at others lost beneath it. It was at each moment becoming a struggle between life and death. The shores seemed to be within his grasp when he lost sight of them and found that he had not strength left to raise himself again to the top of the water. He felt himself descending, and was about to surrender himself to his fate, when he felt his feet touch the bottom. With reserved hope and strength he once more renewed his exertions, and partly by swimming and partly by clambering over the slimy rocks below the water, he emerged where it was shoal enough for him to stand. He tottered forward to a flat rock a few feet from him close to the verge of the beach, and casting his weary frame upon it, he thanked heaven for his preservation. But he was almost insensible from what he had gone through, and after one or two attempts to rise and climb the rocks he sank back, saying faintly, “I had best rest here for a few minutes! I am completely exhausted!— Welcome, liberty! welcome, my be loved native shore! I would rather perish here on thy naked rocks than reign upon the throne of England. If I die here, thank God I die upon the rocks where in childhood and boyhood my feet have trod in happy buoyancy — From this very rock I have fished, and it was here I met the little beautiful girl who—” Here his voice fell, and overpowered by drowsiness he sank into a heavy sleep, the effect of his exposure in the water combined with weariness of the body. Leaving him here to its restorative influence we will go and follow the fortunes for this eventful evening of our story, of the fair maiden whom we introduced into its opening chapter, the beautiful Barbara Frankland. We last left her accompanied by her father, in the act of descending Signal Hill towards her home, he himself hastening thither to make preparations to go down to meet his brig, an enterprize, the result of which thus far, we have witnessed. Upon her father's departure from the house to go to the cave, where he was to meet Finch with the boat, she insisted on accompanying him, to see him embark, saying that she was not afraid to return alone. He, however, permitted her to attend him only as far as the path which led round the foot of the hill, when he took leave of her, saying that he should return the next day. He then hastened on along the beach until he met his boat and embarked down the bay as we have seen. But Barbara, instead of returning immediately homeward, seeing a light sparkling in the window of poor Margaret's hut, went towards it; for she felt like asking her more questions, touching her singular explanation of her three-fold dream. From the hour that she had quitted her her words had been upon her mind, and she could not forbear giving to them more weight than she felt they deserved; indeed she felt ashamed at giving any credence whatever to what she had said to her. She tried to laugh off the impression, and to bring to aid reason and religion, as both hostile to anything like supernatural revelations of this kind from such a source. It was, therefore, partly to see dame Margaret a second time, as well as a desire to see her father depart in the boat and receive his “good night,” that she accompanied him. The place where he had taken boat was about a quarter of a mile below the hut, and the spot where he took leave of her urging her return home at once, was about one yard above, or rather in the rear of the hut. “I will certainly take this opportunity to say one word more to Margaret,” she said, “and I can then reach home safely. It is a retired path from this home and no one is ever to be met upon it. The light that glimmers in her window seems to invite me! I know it is very foolish and perhaps very wrong for me to consult her, and then to let what she chooses to reveal, or call revelations, make such an impression upon me. But I can't resist it! Her words have raised my curiosity to know more. But can she tell me more? At least I will learn from her all that she professes to know.” Then as if willing to silence all other objections she hurried forward, and was in a few moments at the door of the hut, at which she rapped loudly; for the darkness and solitude of the place began already to create in her bosom emotions of fear. Who comes? Good or Evil, who knocks at this hour at the mad woman's door?” “A friend! It is me, Margaret.” “Friends are angels that one hears much of but never sees. But I should know the voice; for it is a pleasant one!” “It is Barbara Frankland.” “And Barbara Frankland is always welcome beneath my roof,” answered the woman, coming to the door, which he previously unbolted, and holding a light in her hand, by which her tall, majestic figure, and wild, yet noble countenance, were seen to striking advantage. Barbara shrank back a step with awe, and an inward feeling of reverence. “Margaret, I came to accompany my father to the cove, where he has taken a boat to go down the bay to meet a brig he expects up; and I thought I would call in and see you, and invite you to go up to the house with me. I have some things that I wish to give you.” “That may be, lady, for you are always generous, thou and thy father, and Heaven bless you! But it is not to ask me to go home with thee that thou art here. But come in, and tell me thy errand,” she said, as she closed the door. “It is over late for a young girl like thee to be abroad unattended, and on so lonely a path; and when thou goest I will go with thee to protect thee. Mad Margaret can walk any where and no man dare insult me! Hast thou eaten thy evening meal? Poor as I am I do not forget hospitality. I was at my humble fare when you came in. It is but a cake of brown bread and a fish, with a cup of tea.” “You are favored, Margaret, in having such a luxury as tea,” said Barbara, smiling. “Yes; but there is a captain, who never returns to port, that he does not make a present of a few pounds of tea and sugar; for he loved my dear boy, and for his sake he is kind and dear to me! Come, maiden, sit down. I have another cup you see; for I don't know how it is, but I always set that cup and plate there. I sometimes think he might sit there again as he used to do, and — but I shall be a child to cry! Let the boy pass!” she cried, sternly and suddenly, as if she felt too proud to grieve. “Sit there in his place. None could so well occupy it! No one has sat there since he—” “Nay, do not speak of him, Margaret! I will gladly remain and drink a cup of tea with thee, if as thou hast promised, thou wilt walk home with me!” With these words, Barbara seated herself upon a straw-bottomed chair, by the table, which was about three feet square, covered with a coarse but white cloth, and garnished with a black teapot; a couple of delf plates, two cups and saucers of the same kind of ware, and a plate of brown bread, and another of dried fish. The maiden had already taken supper with her father, but she did not wish to wound Margaret's sensitiveness touching hospitality, and she therefore condescended to take a seat at her homely board. “And where can the merchant be gone to night, that he takes boat so late?” asked Margaret, as she poured out a cup of fragrant tea, the agreeable odor of which, would have excited the thirst of a Chinese mandarin. “He expects a brig in, I believe, and wishes to meet her before she comes up to town.” “There, Miss Barbara, is your tea. I have none but the brown sugar; and I have no cream.” “It is very good as it is, Margaret,” answered the maiden. “How lonely you must be here to be always alone.” “I am never alone. I have with me the memory of my boy, and then there is One who is always present!” she added, looking upward with reverence.— “But we we will talk of something else. My heart will swell yet when I speak of my noble lad! I can't forget him! I live only with the hope of seeing him in a better world! They say, I am crazed, that the loss of my boy crazed me! Perhaps I am, for I know I am not as I was when he was with me. I have been a different person since.— Sometimes, I have been many weeks, and could not tell at the end what I was doing all the while or where I was!— But people said I wandered by the sea, and lived on shells and sat upon the rocks and sang about my boy; and called sometimes to the waves to give him back to me. Perhaps I did, perhaps I did; for I cannot recollect! I know that sometimes I see only five or six days of a month; the rest go and I know nothing of them. I remember it was one Sunday morning I was seated in my door listening to God's bells ring his people to worship him, and the next thing I remembered I was twenty miles away down the bay; and people told me I had been there two weeks; but I know not how I got there! Perhaps I am crazy! perhaps I am!” she said, sadly, and placing her hand to her forehead. “They tell me I have told a great many fortunes at such times, and they became true; but I remember it not, Barbara! So your father has gone down to meet his brig. He is a rich and good man. You are his only child, and will be rich! Take care of thy heart, maiden! Love not for riches, for thou hast enough of thy own, but for merit, though it come to thee in rags.” “I have independence enough to do it, Margaret,” responded the young girl, with a smile of resolution.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XIX. Margaret looked steadily through her large dark eyes upon the maiden, as she replied to her in the decided manner that she did, and then said impressively, “I know it, lady! I know thou art not one of those who desire to add silver to gold, but dost reverence worth more than rank or wealth. I have marked thee in thy daily walk and conversation, and I know the goodness and truth that is in thee! I see before thee happiness and peace!” “Thanks for these words, for I found evil from the interpretation of my dream, Margaret!” “Said I so? Oh, no! I said the dream foretold danger, but that thou shouldst be-delivered from it!” “Will you tell me what kind of danger, and from whom?” “That is not best for you to know, lady! But I will tell thee that thou art destined to make some deserving young man happy. The cage in which he kept thee as a bird, shows that he is very poor, and can furnish thee no house of more value than a cage. But he will love thee, and the love of his heart will be to thee instead of riches that he hath not! But I can tell thee no more!” “Tell me my fortune, Margaret, as thou hast those of other maidens in the town!” “That was when the dark spirit was upon me! in the hours when I walked in the body as if I was not in it, for I knew not whither my feet wandered, nor what my eyes saw, or my lips spoke! Come to me, then, and I will tell thee!” “Nay, but now, Margaret,” persevered Barbara, “Here is my tea-cup, and the grounds, as I turn it up, form themselves into strange shapes. Look at them, and see what thou canst make of them!” “No, no! I cannot now! The spirit of madness is not upon me now!” she said sadly; “and Heaven be thanked that it has passed for a while!” “But you have just foretold things for me!” “No, not foretold, lady! I have but interpreted thy dream. Thou didst give me the text, and I gave thee but my comments. See, first if the future prove my words, ere thou givest me credit for wisdom and cunning. I think they will come to pass; but the future no mortal knoweth! Dreams are nearer the opening of the future than anything else we know of on earth. All scenery of dreams lies more or less in the future! One that notes them well can soon learn to interpret their language. I have dreamed every night since my poor boy went! and I have studied my dreams to know what was in them revealed touching him; and so I am skilled in them! It is no more! Yet I believe what I have said to thee will take place. Danger and rescue; love and loveliness! and the end peace Hark! There is a heavy cannon fired! The sound is down the bay!” “My dear father! I hope he is not in danger!” exclaimed Barbara, looking from the window. “No one can tell! There is a second gun! There must be some difficulty down the bay! I saw, just after dark, the schooner of war that came up this afternoon, go down past; and, doubtless, she has fallen in with some vessel!” “And fired upon her! I pray not, for it may be the Free-Trader, with my father on board!” “Hope for the best, maiden! There are other ships in the bay, no doubt; And why should the schooner fire into thy father's vessel?” “You know the late laws the Parliament has established, compelling all merchants to pay heavy duties to the crown!” “Yes; it is in all men's mouths!” “The merchants, with my father at their head, have called a meeting, binding themselves to resist the execution of this law! The Free-Trader, one of my father's ships, is below, and he has gone down for the purpose of getting her into port during the night, so that he may not be compelled to pay the imposts; for he thinks, and so do I, that he owes it to the liberty and rights of the colonies, now being trampled upon by the king, in the most lawless and oppressive mnnner, to resist and evade this law!” “He is right! The merchants and men of the colonies are right! Heaven will sustain them! Ah, proud George of Hanover, thou art playing a losing game with thy kingly cards!” she cried with the air and the gestures of a prophetess. “Thou wilt press the weak till they turn upon thee, and smite the crown from thy brow, and break thy sceptre! This people, which thou art trying to crush, and humble, and oppress, fearing their might and power, will become too great, they are freemen! They know no lords but the Lord above! There is not a serf among them! Every man is the owner of the soil he tills, and with the sweat of his brow he eats his own bread, yes, not for lords does he dig and delve, nor will he be a king's slave! Resist, men of the New World, the yoke of the Old! Do ye not know that your destiny is onward, and that these colonies shall grow into an Empire that shall give laws to half the world!” “There goes a rocket into the sky!” exclaimed Barbara, who had listened with surprise to the thrilling words of Margaret. “I fear some evil will befal my dear father!” “Nay, he is safe! A man who so loves his country and hates oppression, will not die at a time when brave men are needed?” “Can you tell what can be the meaning of that rocket?” “It must be to light the water that they may see! Do not fear for the good man, your father! Wilt thou go home now? Perhaps in the town I may learn for thee what this means. Ere you came in I beheld a rocket go up from the sloop-of-war, and glare the sky wide and far; and for an instant it was noon day!” “I did not see it! It must have been before my father and I left the house! I am ready to return; but I do not fear to go alone! Still I would rather have you accompany me, as you can learn from some persons in town their supposed cause for the firing. I trust it is not owing to the presence of the Free-Trader!” The maiden left the cabin and waited a moment outside for Margaret to secure her door. “I have not much of value to tempt a thief's hand, lady, but the least article which once belonged to my boy, in this house, is dearer to me than gold!” “Margaret,” said Barbara, as they walked side by side in the path that led up over the hill, for Margaret said she would take this, it being better seen in the night; “you have alluded this evening often to your son! Will you forgive me if I ask you to tell me how it was you lost him! It may relieve your heart to talk about him; for in almost everything you say you name him. Speak freely and relieve your heart. You have never told me how he was taken from you!” “Few have been told, maiden; for to speak of him has roused my madness. Few have dared to ask me! But you speak gently, and seem to sympathise with me. I will try and talk to thee of him; for I know if he had grown up to manhood he would have loved thee as I love thee! Oh, he was very beautiful, my darling boy! I can recollect his dark hazel eyes, sparkling with affection, and his sweet but noble smiles! Then his hair was the riches brown and fell about his neck in ringlets, which in the sunshine were as rich as gold!” “How old was he then?” asked Barbara, as she picked her way along the winding path. “He was sixteen then, for I am telling thee how he looked the last time I saw him. Dost thou not remember him?” “I never saw him, Margaret!” “But I think he saw thee one day, not long ere he was stolen from me; and therefore thou must have seen him! Dost thou recollect meeting one day on the pictured rock, just after you came home from Boston, where you were at school, a lad who was fishing, you having a basket of pebbles and shells on your arm!” “Yes, indeed I recollect him!” exclaimed Barbara, with cheeks that she felt were warm with her heart's emo tions; and she felt glad that the darkness hid her blushes of pleased surprise; for well did she recollect the handsome youth, and to this day had loved to think of him. Often had she wondered who he was, and why she never met him again; for she visited that part of the shore often for weeks afterwards, with the secret hope of meeting him, or seeing him, not knowing that he had two days after that first interview been torn from his home. But he had carried away in his heart the indelible memorial of her sweet face and pleasant voice; and as we have seen she loved to remember him. Their interview had lasted but for a few moments, but it was a delightful one to him. She came upon him while fishing from the rock, all unexpectedly walking along with her head down, looking for shells and colored pebbles. But he had seen her coming along, and watched her with surprise and delight, for he thought he had never seen any one so beautiful. He let her approach till the rock interrupted her advance, when she looked up and beheld his fair eyes bent admiringly upon her. With a start and exclamation between alarm and maidenly modesty, she stepped back, while her cheeks glowed like roses, and said with pretty embarrassment, “I did not see you before!” “Do not run away,” he said smiling; “I have several beautiful shells and pebbles hid here in the rock, that I have picked up at different times. I see you like such things, and will give give them to you!” And without waiting for a reply he dropped his line, and springing to his feet went to a hollow in the rock, from which he took his two hands-full of handsome shells and stones, and ran and threw them into her basket! “How beautiful they are!” exclaimed Barbara, her heart quite won by his politeness, his handsome face, and his disposition to oblige her; and no person could have made her a present that would have been the half so acceptable to her. “But you should not do so! You have robbed yourself: and—” “I don't want them! I don't care about them!” he said warmly. “I don't know that I ought to keep them, but you have mixed them up so with mine, I don't know how to separate them again!” “I hope you won't try! Keep them! and if you like any more of them I will search the beach for them; for I know better than you where to find the prettiest!” “You are so kind; but I shan't take any more; and I don't like to take these; but that I may make it equal with you, take that! It is not much; but my father has always told me never to receive a gift without returning it by another. So keep it!” “If you will give it as a gift,” answered the youth, hesitating, and looking deep admiration into her lovely eyes. “I will take it; but I can't receive it as a pay for the shells!” “If you will take it, you may have it as a gift,” answered the young girl, blushing; and she placed in his hand a little brooch of small value. He took it, and with a gallant air placed it in his bosom, saying, “I shall keep it to remember you by!” “But I don't know you,” she answered, as she gazed on the neat but humble attire of the youth, which marked his position to be beneath her own; “I don't know who you are!” “My name is —” Before he completed the sentence she had darted away from him up the path-way, and upon looking around he saw that she had taken alarm at a pirogue containing a white man and an Indian, that silently came paddling by, and was close upon them before it was discovered. Although she was but fourteen, the little maid had too keen a sense of propriety to be seen by such men, holding, as it were, a confidential conversation with the handsome young fisherman, and thus she took to flight. “We have scared the pretty bird, Martin,” said the man laughing, as he paddled his boat past. “She was gathering shells on the beach, and I only gave her some I collected,” he answered, deeply confused. The boat passed on its way and disappeared, and the maiden also was out of sight. He would have gone to overtake her and talk more with her, and ask her her name; but recollecting how she had fled from the place, he feared he should offend her. So he sat down upon the rock again, and resumed his fishing lines; but he caught no more fish that day, for his thoughts were absent and upon the beautiful maiden, whose presence seemed more like a vision than a reality. When he returned home he related to his mother the adventure, and begged her to learn who she was. This she promised, to please him; but the next day he was forcibly taken off by a press-gang.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XX. Such, then, being the history of Barbara's interview with the unknown youth who had never since that time been forgotten by her, but rather remembered with pleasure, it is not surprising that she started with surprise, and that her heart bounded with strange joy, when Margaret said to her—“If you do not know that you have met with my dear boy, he has seen you; and if he lives to this day,” she added, “he remembers you! But let us sit here upon this bank! I am fatigued. We will walk on after we rest.” “Do you say he met me upon the Carved Rock?” she exclaimed. “Yes, lady, he met thee then, and thou didst smile upon him and speak so kindly to him that his boyish heart was won at once!” “I never met but one person there, and he was a youth of sixteen, but—” “But you think it could not be my boy! Yet it was he. He came home and told me how he had seen you, and that he poured into a basket which you carried—” “All his beautiful shells!—” “Yes, and that you in return gave him a small brooch—” “Then it was, it must have been been your son! Why did I not suspect it before? Why did I not know it before?” she cried, with sincere joy. “He did not know you, and asked me to find out who you were for him; and I promised to do so; though from his description I expected it was you!” “And how did you ascertain?” “By seeing the brooch, which he did not show me nor speak of till the next day. I knew it at once, for I had seen you wear it, and noticed it as it had a dark-green stone with red spots upon it! I knew the brooch at once; but I did not tell my boy who you were; for I did not wish to make him unhappy; for I felt that as soon as he learned you were so rich and great, and so far above him, he would pine and be low-hearted; and so I did not tell him: but I might as well, for the same night he was torn from me!” “My dear Margaret,” said Barbara, after a few moments' silence, “I hardly know how to explain to you my feelings at this discovery. I will, however, be frank with you, for it may please you, now that your son is lost to you; but I trust you will yet see him again! to know that from that hour when he gave me the shells, I have not ceased to think of him with pleasure, and to wonder who he was! I was impressed with his politeness and modest diffidence, and I could not but think a great deal of him; and, I will tell you the truth, went to the Carved Rock after that more than once in hopes of meeting with him; and I have recently began to fancy, Margaret, that I might have dreamed, or that he was a momentary vision, as he never appeared again.— But now all is cleared up. And it is so strange that he should be your son!” “I hope, lady,” said Margaret, with something of pride and bitterness, “I hope that you will not for this hate his memory, which, till now, you have seemed to cherish!” “Hate him because thou art his mother! Oh, no, Margaret! I rather think of him the more kindly!” “God bless you, maiden! You are true and good as you are beautiful. I see you have no pride in your heart. But if he had remained and met you again and again, children as you were, my poor boy would have loved only to despair. It is better that he was taken as he was! Better for you both!” “No, no, Margaret!” answered Barbara, with warmth of feeling as if her generous spirit hastened to defend itself from any such charge as Margaret's words implied. “If he had remained and we had met often, and we had grown up loving one another, as certainly I think we should have done, had he not been so cruelly carried away, his being your son, his humble condition and poverty, let me say without offence to you, Margaret, would have had no weight with me!” “Even had he asked your hand, maiden, when he came to manhood?” “No, Margaret, no! For if it could be that I loved him, he must have been worthy of my love; for I could love no one whom I did not feel was so. Believe me, I grieve with you, now in your loss; for I have thought so much about him, that I have often resolved in my secret heart, that I will never love any one but that unknown youth!” “And is this the reason, lady, that thou hast refused the alliance with three different suitors, all thy equals in rank and in wealth?” “Thou hast guessed it, Margaret.— You may think me foolish, but with the recollection of the handsome youth, with his image engraven on my heart, and a secret, half-formed hope that in some way, my destiny would yet be united with his, I could not give myself to another!” “Then it is true that thou lovest my son, even now? How wonderful is all this!” “I do love him, Margaret; I have loved him from that day, and with years has that love grown in my heart, till there is no more room for any other!” “It is safe for you to speak thus lady,” answered Margaret, who, from the bank where they had seated them, selves to rest, was gazing off upon the waters of the bay as they mirrored the sparkling stars, “it is safe for you to confess this blessed news now, that my boy is dead; but were he living, you would shrink from confessing that you loved the son of Margaret, the fisherman's widow!” “Never, Margaret; not if he should appear to-morrow! At least, if he returned without dishonor,” she added, quickly; “but this could not be in one with so noble an air and a look so pure and generous as he had! Yet, even should he return a guilty being, I should still cherish my early love for him and sorrow for his fall, though prudence might lead me to withdraw from him! But why speak thus of him!” she said, sadly. “He is no doubt lost to us both. If he should return, I feel that he will return with honor, and be worthy of the hopes I have so long cherished for him!” “I thank thee, I thank thee, maiden. You do him only justice. Such words are sweet to my ears. Heaven reward you for them. How dear thou art to me since this confession!” “Now, Margaret, let our conversation, I pray thee, be secret between us.” “It shall be so, maiden. It is sacred. Oh, thanks be to Heaven that I can talk to thee of my lost one, knowing thou wilt listen.” “Will you tell me, Margaret—” “Hist! What is that speaking in the water?” “I heard nothing.” “Nay, it was but a fish jumping.— What did you ask?” “Will you tell me how it was he was taken from you?” “Ah, it was a dark, sad hour, that hour I parted from my boy,” answered Margaret, sadly, as she gloomily shook her head. “But I will tell thee how it was, for thou art now next to my son, in my heart, for thou, too, lovest him. I had just put supper on the table—it is now five years ago; for it was on the twenty-first of May, in '67.” “This is the twenty-first of May.” “This?” “Yes, Margaret.” “Are you sure? for I lose not only days of the month, but weeks often.” “It is the twenty-first day, Margaret.” “Then it is the anniversary of my boy's loss. Oh, why have I not kept fast and prayed this day as I have done heretofore? But I will make to-morrow a day of wailing and mourning.— Five years ago this very day it was, maiden. I was waiting for my boy to come in to supper; for he had gone to town on an errand for me. All at once I heard shouting over by the hill-side, here and there a gun was fired close outside the cottage as it seemed, and as I got up to run at the door, Martin bounded into the room like a hunted deer, his face covered with blood! “`Hide me, mother!' he cried.— `The press-gang I have fought till they were too many for me!' These were his words. I at once barred the door, and he was helping me to take up a board of the floor, under which to conceal himself, when the door was assailed and broken open by four armed men with uniforms. `There he is, seize him!' cried the leader. I stood before them calling to Martin to fly by the window; but seeing one of the men thrusting me rudely aside, and another strike me heavily, he flew to my aid armed with a boat-hook. With this he drove them across the room and stood at bay like a lion; but he at length became faint from a gun-shot wound in his temple, (for they had fired on him as he fled from them,) and staggering fell into my arms. The demons then tore him from my hold and struck me senseless. When I recovered I was alone! I rose and ran hither and thither calling the name of my son. But all was silent. I hastened to the town and asked everywhere for my boy; and was at length told he and three others had been taken off to a frigate then in the harbor and that there was no hope of recovering him. It was a moonlight night, and they pointed the frigate out to me with her sails spread and going out of the harbor. I did not wait to reflect: I hastened back to my home, and, taking Martin's boat, launched out into the bay. The frigate passed and I pursued, calling on the name of my child, now imploring, now entreating, now cursing those who tore him from me! But the ship went on, the hearts of the men on board as hard as the wood of the ship itself and as senseless. When day dawned, the ship was twenty miles down the bay, and I was still pursuing. She was a league from me at sunrise, and yet my arm never wearied. I paddled without rest, without weariness! As the sun rose a storm arose, and as the waters grew black with the shadows of the storm-clouds, and the waves and winds roared, and the thunder rolled overhead, I laughed and clapped my hands and shouted with the storm! I became mad as it increased, and as the lightning flashed I bared my bosom to their bolts and called on the Almighty to strike, now that my child was taken from me. I have no further recollection of anything, save coming to myself in the hut of the light-house-keeper, many leagues below this. From him and his family I learned that I had been drifted in my boat by the storm upon the head-land, that he, seeing the boat tossed upon the waves, hastened to the shore, but he did not discover that it contained a human being until a wave tossed it upon the beach. He then beheld me lying in it insensible and he supposed dead. He took me to his dwelling, and restored me to consciousness, but never to reason!” “Yes, to reason, Margaret,” answered Barbara, with generous emotion: “you have your reason now! Surely you talk with me perfectly yourself.” “I may seem so at times, maiden; but it is merely a suspension, an interval of my disease of mind. I may the next five minutes be the raving madwoman you have beheld me. It is your gentle presence and sympathy that makes me calm now.” “For my sake continue so, Margaret.” “I will, child, I will, at least till the demon possesses me again. This is the first time I ever spoke of my boy so calmly.” “I hope you will try to speak of him in the same mood, and learn to bear his loss, and thus you may be restored to yourself.” “Hist, again! There is a splashing in the water close by that jutting rock; it sounds like a man swimming. Hark, I hear a strong panting and a heavy breathing!” “I hear it!” cried Barbara, rising with alarm and surprise; for the sound was very near, the path in which they were moving wound along at this place very close to the water. “It sounds like a man swimming and struggling for his life! There! all is still again!” “Do you think it can be?” asked the maiden, eagerly. “I see nothing.” “There! Look! It is a head above the water, but whether a dog, a horse, or a man I cannot say. It is certainly some living object; and it labors heavily to reach the shore.” “There, it has sunk again out of sight!” cried Barbara “And now it appears nearer the shore. Hark, there is a groan of agony! It is a man striving to reach the shore!” “Let us fly to his aid!” cried Barbara; but Margaret had already anticipated her words by bounding down the shore side towards the water. Barbara was following, when the former turned back, saying— “We can't reach the place where he is trying to reach the shore by this way, as there is a steep precipice. We must go back a few rods and so down by the path to the beach. Follow me. It is a human life to be saved! He may have strength to reach the rocks, but perish for want of a helping hand!” “It may be some deserter from the English ship; perhaps some poor impressed seaman striving to escape from his bondage!” cried Barbara, as they hastened to reach the water. “Then in the name of my dear son let us to his rescue! If he perish his blood be upon my head!” With these words, she ran forward in the darkness with the firm and confident step of noon-day.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XXI. The familiarity of Margaret with the way, and her greater speed of foot, caused her to outstrip Barbara, and leave her behind. The maiden, however, pursued after her as rapidly as possible, and soon found herself in sight of the Carved Rock, a few yards above on the beach. Here she saw Margaret stop and utter an exclamation of surprise and pity. “It is a man, and he lies here senseless upon the rock,” she cried. “But his pulse beats. Run for help, lady.” But Barbara was already at her side, and gazed with fear and amazement upon the form of the young man as he lay upon the rock. But whether he was old or young she could not discern for the darkness. She had the courage to lay her hand upon his damp forehead: “He is not dead, Margaret. It is warm.” “No, he is not dead,” answered Margaret, as she raised his head and put back the wet locks from his brow, while she tried to discern the features. “He is not insensible either. It seems to me by his breathing that it is sleep.— But will you hasten for aid. I will stay with him alone till you come back. I do not fear. He is a seaman by his dress. Perhaps, as you said, an escaped colonist who has been impressed.” Barbara was about to leave the spot, inspired by a desire to benefit and perhaps save the life of a fellow-being, when he moved, and said faintly, “Who is here? Am I with friends, and safe?” “Friends, and safe,” answered Margaret, with a voice that was tremulous with joy at hearing him speak. “Stay, Barbara, he may be able to walk soon.” “I am better now. Women around me. Thank God, then I have nothing to fear,” said Martin, as he raised himself up, and looked from one to the other. “I shall be better soon. Only fatigue. I have swam far. It was a mercy I reached the shore as I did. Yes, I shall be able to walk soon. Thanks, good woman. I owe my restoration to you. I can stand, you see.” And he rose to his feet. “No, sir,” said Margaret, “you recovered of yourself. We did nothing.” “I felt a soft warm hand laid upon my temples, which brought me to consciousness. How did you find me here?” “We saw you swimming and struggling in the water from the hill above there, and hastened to your aid,” answered Barbara. “Thanks, thanks! I owe my life to you. I need not fear to trust you, ladies,” he added, “for I must still place my safety in your hands; for I know that I have no fear of being betrayed; for you must be true friends of the colony.” “We are not only the friends of the colony, but the foes of England the Oppressor,” responded Margaret, energetically. “Then I am safe, and you shall know who I am and why I am here. I was an impressed seaman on board the sloop-of-war Bexley, and the sight of my native land inspired me with the hopes of freedom and once more beholding the dear friends of my childhood, so taking advantage of the approach of night I broke my chains, for I had been chained to keep me from getting away from the ship while in port, and dropping into the water swam for the land; which, after nearly drowning from fatigue, I have at length reached.” “And here you shall be safe,” answered Margaret, who, at his recital thought of her own boy, and her heart bled for him, and yearned towards the youthful sailor as if he were her own son. As he stood up and they could get a better view of his figure they could see that he was a young man, which the tones of his fine voice also bespoke him to be. And as he looked from one to the other of the ladies, he could see that one was youthful and the other elderly, though it was too dark to distinguish features. Margaret was about to ask him who his friends were, and his name, when the cannonading which the Gaspee opened upon the brig thundered upon their ears, and at once drew their attention. “What can it be? I fear my father is in peril!” exclaimed Barbara, with filial alarm. “It is no doubt the schooner of war that went down the bay just after sunset firing at some vessel that tries to elude her,” answered Martin. “That vessel must be my father's!” exclaimed Barbara. “Fear nothing, maiden. He is safe in the hands of One who is over us all. Let us see that this youth is first cared for; for there may be boats sent after him. He must first be concealed.” “And where?” asked Barbara, shrinking from the heavy roar of the cannon, which at the same time gave her a momentary light by which she saw that the stranger was not only young but, though pale, very handsome; and her interest in him became at once deeper. “In my own house,” answered Margaret. “Nay, not there. He will not be safe there, for it will be one of the first places, being so near the shore, that will be searched.” “No, I have made a place there so secret that no human eye can detect it. Weeks,” she muttered, in an under tone to herself, “weeks on weeks did I labor at it after my boy was stolen, to hide him in should he ever return. It must now conceal this youth instead of my son. But all is ordered right.— Come, young man, follow me if you can walk, and if you do not feel strong enough, lean upon my arm and this young maiden's.” “No, thanks to you both, ladies, I can walk well. It was only fatigue, and I am strong again. You seem to me to be two angels sent to my relief. Your words of kindness, after so many years of bondage and harsh language, deeply affect me. It is gratitude and joy rather than weakness, that agitates my voice. I will go with you, if you can take me to a place of security for a day or two till I can escape up the bay.— But if my presence is to endanger either of you, I will not go with you a step farther.” “It is my command that you go with us, young man,” answered Margaret, kindly, but firmly. “Where I shall hide you, a Sleuth-hound could not find you out, though they should hunt you with one, as they have done others.” “He had best go to my father's for security,” said Barbara. “They will not think of searching his house, while yours would be sure to be visited.” “No, no. I will not let him leave me. I must protect him for my boy's sake. How do I know but that he has-seen him ayond the seas, and has heard him speak of me.” “That voice becomes more and more familiar. It must be she. Thou hast a son then, away. Tell me what his name is!” cried the young man, deeply moved, while he impulsively grasped her hand. “Martin Manwaring!” “My mother! my beloved mother,” he cried, casting himself into her arms. “I am thy son. I am Martin, so long lost to thee. God has heard my prayer.” “Thou art my son. I know thee now. My heart has been yearning toward thee. Now am I ready to die in peace. Let me fold thee closer to my heart, my child. Oh, it is thy kiss again. Now am I blessed indeed.— Let us kneel here in silence, my son.— Barbara kneel with us here. Let us thank God ere we speak or move a step, or word. This moment of reunion is sacred and should be offered to God.” Margaret knelt then upon the moss-covered rock, and Martin still clasped to her bosom sank also by her side. The maiden knelt by them; and for a moment the three were silent in a deep heartfelt offering of gratitude to heaven Barbara's heart was as full as theirs; for she rejoiced for her rejoicing, and his, and for herself; for a secret delight took possession of her soul at the consciousness that the youth so long cherished in her remembrance knelt so close to her. “Now we have tbanked God, the giver of all good, and the restorer of the wanderer, let us rise and go forward to a place of safety; for we have, indeed, a treasure now to conceal. And I wish to have a light to behold my son's face once more. Joy! joy. I will hold thee fast, my son, lest this should prove all a dream. I will cling to thee, for thy presence has given me back all my reason and affection. I feel that I am human again, that the storm of madness will no more sweep over the placid ocean of my being.” “Madness, mother?” “It is nothing; heed me not. I have thee once more, and the past is to be buried.” “Wonderful, that I should first be met by thee, dear mother. I know not how to express in words my joy. I am overpowered with too much happiness.” “You need not talk now. You are safe and that is all I wish now to know. We will talk when we reach home.” “I am so rejoiced to find that your life is preserved, my dear mother,” he said as he walked on by her side, while Bar bara walked on a little ways before them; “for I have not heard from thee since I was taken.” “My dear, dear boy! nor I of thee! I had long since numbered thee with the dead; and now to meet thee and to be, as it were thy preserver, is enough to overthrow my reason had it not been wrecked before; but it has restored it to me; for I am now myself again. Dost thou know this maiden?” “I have wished to ask, mother. “Not now. I will tell thee, if thou dost not recognise her when we get to the cottage.” Barbara had hastened her steps as she thought Margaret was about to divulge her name, forgetting that he had never heard it, and she was relieved when she postponed the intelligence to ascertain if he would recognize her. “And I should like to see if he does,” she thought; “for this will be proof to me whether he has remembered me.” She still kept some distance ahead and they soon reached the hut, and upon coming up to the door, Martin stopped and seemed overcome with his feelings. “How familiar all is here. I never expected, my dear mother, to stand again where I now stand.” “And do not linger there now, my dear boy. Danger may meance you from without, and you forget that you are wet through. But I will run in and strike a light. I have not seen your face yet, my boy.” “I hope you will find that it is still that of Martin, with all I have passed through,” he answered. “Is it possible I am here again?” “Your happiness at once more returning home,” said Barbara, with emotion; “must be very great. I feel that I can sympathise with you fully in once more beholding your mother.” “I am too full of joy, lady. This is the happiest moment of my existence. An hour ago I was a prisoner in chains on board a king's ship, and now I am in the hands of friends and hear the kind voice of my mother, a voice that has not been heard by me save in dreams, for five years. I thought as I revived upon the rock and heard her speaking over me, that it sounded like my mother's voice; but I was afraid to hope for so much bliss. The voice of those we love we can never forget.” “Now, my dear boy,” cried Margaret, coming out of the hut whither she had gone to light a lamp, “now come and let me look on thee. Thou wilt find me greatly changed, I fear, for I have been sorrow's child since you were torn from me.” He hastened forward and entered the hut, in which a lamp burned brightly upon the table in the centre. As he came in Margaret raised the lamp to his face and gazed upon it, while Barbara with curiosity came forward to see him. “I should know thee in India, my dear boy. The same eye, and smile, and noble brow; but pale, as thou oughtest to be afterthy fatigue in swimming so far. And how tall, and handsome you have grown. Behold him, Barbara. Is there in the colony a handsomer youth to look upon?” Barbara dropped her eyes and deeply blushed before the admiring, surprised, and delighted gaze of the young man; for she had hardly time to cast a look upon him and recognize in the mould of manly beauty, the features of the fisher's boy, before she felt that she was recognized by him and was compelled to drop her eyes before his eager, earnest, joy-bewildered gaze. “Mother, dear mother, pardon me.— But tell me—” “Do you recognize her, Martin?” interrupted Margaret, her eyes gleaming with delight. “The same I met and gave the shells to, mother, only, if possible far more beautiful in the bloom of maturity. It is she. For I have never forgotten her, and even believed I knew her voice, but dared not hope for so much happiness all at one time. I have waited with as much impatience for the light to reveal her countenance as you have for it to look at me. But I am no doubt surprising you, lady, by my words and speaking of an event that you have long forgotten.” “I have not forgotten you,” answered Barbara, with ingenuous frankness. “But until this evening I knew not who it was who was so generous as to fill up my basket of shells with his own treasured ones.” “And from that hour I have loved to think of you,” answered Martin, with emotion; “and this little broach I have preserved through all my vicissitudes as the dearest jewel that earth could bestow on me; for it was your gift.” As he spoke he opened his jacket and displayed appended to a steel chain the little brooch she had so long before bestowed upon him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XXII. Barbara Frankland was too little skilled in the arts of coquetry, had too little pride of wealth orstation, and possessed too much genuine honest sincerity to disguise the pleasure that the bold but respectful words of the young man gave her. She betrayed her gratification in her looks, which Margaret closely watched to see if the maiden, now that her son had returned, was ready to abide by the words she had uttered when both supposed him lost. “I am very happy to be remembered by you,” she answered, when he had done speaking, and looking more beautiful from her pleased confusion than she had ever looked in her life, “I will be as frank as to say that I have not only in my turn remembered you, but I have preserved every one of the shells you gave me with the greatest care, but mark you,” she added, smiling archly and feeling as if she had perhaps confessed more than she ought to have done, “but I say this to you because you are Margaret's son, whom I greatly esteem, for I should not speak so freely to you were you a stranger.” And she walked towards the door as if to hide the beaming expression of her face from him. “I am most happy then, not to be looked upon by you as a stranger,” he answered with deep joy in his eyes.— “I feel, lady, that I have been very `bold, for I am but a seaman, and you-are, I see, far superior in birth and station to —” “You have well guessed Martin,” said his mother, interrupting him, “yet she has no pride, as you see. But let this pass, you will be friends, at least.” “Mother, who is she?” asked Martin, in a low tone. “Let me at least learn the name of one whose image has been engraven on my heart from the hour I first met her.” “She is Barbara Frankland, the heiress.” “Daughter of the rich merchant?” “No less, my boy.” “Then this meeting I would rather had never taken place,” he answered bitterly. “I have found her only to lose her forever! This is a wretched hour for me, my dear mother, even with the joy of meeting you.” “Nay, my son, courage and hope. She is as generous and good as she is rich. And I know loves—” Here Margaret's words were interrupted by Barbara, who being in the door, saw the Free-Trader passing up close to the shore under full sail, and exclaimed: “A ship!” Both sprang to the door, and Martin, after a moment's scrutiny, said: “It is a brig.” “Then it must be my father's,” said Barbara. “I trust he is safe.” “That is no doubt the vessel that this Gaspee has been firing at, and she has escaped her,” said Martin. “If so, I rejoice from my heart, for this revenue law should be resisted by all true men of America, with their heart's best blood if need be.” “So speaks my father, Martin,” said Barbara, with animation, “and I rejoice to hear you utter the same sentiments.” “My boy is a true colonist, maiden. He is poor and lowly, but—” “Speak not in this way of him, Margaret, it is the same to me, whether he be rich or poor. I esteem no one for wealth or rank, thou art well apprised. The brig is making rapidly towards the town, I would that I knew my father were safe.” “Let me go and ascertain for you. I know well the way, though it is so long since I have walked the paths,” cried Martin, moving forward. “I can reach the wharves by the time the brig does.” “No, no, not to expose yourself to danger. Your safety depends on concealment, for there will be parties in search of you. We must not lose you so soon, must we, Mrs. Manwaring,” said Barbara, smiling. “I would not consent for him to go, save for you, Barbara,” answered the mother, as she held him by the hand. “But he shall go for thee, for I know he would risk his life for you.” “Indeed, Iwould!” answered Martin, warmly. “You must remain here then, and please me by obedience, Mr. Manwaring,” said she, with playful firmness. “Your safety must first be consulted. I will go home and send to the pier for news of my father. Margaret, see that he does not expose himself rashly.” “I will at once conceal him!” “Unless you are sure that he will be perfectly secure from any searching party, I think you had best come to my father's, for there they would not look for him.” “No, he must be kept with me here He will be safe.” “Then I leave you with him,” she answered, “and I will see you early in the morning; but on no account leave your house, for it might be searched in your absence.” “Miss Frankland, I do not know how to express my emotions of gratitude that you should manifest such an interest in me.” “Did we not show it in you when we first discovered you, not knowing who you were, or whether you were old or young, gentle or simple,” she answered, playfully. “True,” he answered, “true. I have presumed too much,” he added, sadly. “No, do not despair. We shall at least be friends,” she said in a marked and kind manner, as she took his hand in passing him. “Let us both hope the the best. Good night! To-morrow early, Margaret, thou shalt either see or hear from me.” “Good night, maiden,” said Mrs. Manwaring, who from the first moment of the discovery of her son had manifested entire restoration to her former sane state of mind, at which Barbara, who could not but see the sudden and great change in her, was astonished, while her heart was filled with the deepest gratitude, for she felt how bitter would have been to Martin the hour of his meeting with his mother, if he had found in her the “mad Margaret,” who for five years past had been the wild wanderer and the common fortune-teller of the colony. But now that in her words, her looks, her deportment, she once more beheld her clothed in her right mind, she could not refrain from tears of joy; for the fact that she had discovered in Margaret the mother of the youth who had given her the shells, had enlisted her warmest interest in her, and led her to sympathise in all that befel her, whether of good or evil. “Miss Frankland,” said Martin, advancing from the door to overtake her, after she had left it to proceed homeward, her bosom filled with the liveliest fears for her father's safety, “I cannot consent to let you go on this lonely road alone.” “Nor can I consent for you to accompany me,” she answered, firmly. “There is more than one interested in your safety, Mr. Manwaring.” “More than one!” he repeated, with trembling joy. “Yes, but perhaps I have said more than I should have done. Return and let me hasten on my way.” “I obey you,” he responded turning back, but he stopped and looked after her till she disappeared, and then re-entering his mother's hut, was once more clasped to her maternal bosom. “I have been trying to realise that my child is restored to me,” she said, with tears, “but I cannot. It seems like a dream to me, Martin. But these tears are real, and I have not shed a tear since the day you left me. All the past has been like a fearful night-mare!” “Speak not of it, mother. I am restored to you, and my happiness is increased in finding you alive.” “I have been as one dead, though, Martin, my child. You ought to know, and will hear it, so I will first tell thee the worst. I have been a mad woman, but heaven has restored my reason in restoring you.” “Mad?” “Yes, your loss overturned my poor brain, but you see I am well now.” “Mad!” he repeated, “my mother been mad!” “Not now! It is passed. Did you not know, I took the boat and followed you in the ship?” “I saw you not, but they told me afterwards you did. I was cast into the lowest part of the ship, and remained there three days because I refused to work. They told me you followed me, dear mother.” “For ten leagues, till a storm drove me ashore, and I was picked up by some humane persons, but my reason was gone, they told me.” “My poor mother!” “And so I have been ever since. Sometimes I would gain my right mind for a few days, and go to church to hear the sweet gospel, which always soothed me, but then I would soon after be worse than ever. So I have been. People have proved kind to me, but I know I have been the sport and mock of the unfeeling. They called me “Mad Margaret,” and came to me to tell their fortunes. But do not look so sorrowful, my boy. Your return has restored me to myself. I feel that I am well now. But I have told thee this, that you may not hear it first from others, and be shocked!” “My dear mother! This has all been suffered for me. But I hope, as you say, it is passed. And Miss Frankland, has she been kind?” “Let us talk of her, for it is good to talk of the good, my son. She has been an angel to me in my affiction. She has relieved my wants, and her father has been most charitable to me!” “God bless them both!” How strange that you two, the only two I love, on earth, should have met me to-night so providentially.” “Her father has gone down to meet a vessel to-night, and she came to see him to his boat, and called in upon me on her way home, and I talked of you to her as I was walking homeward with her, and I learned from her that—” “That—?” he gasped, eagerly. “That she loved you.” “Loved me—me. Heaven be thanked! Oh! my dear mother, mock not the sweet hopes and fears of my years of wanderings. Tell me truly all!” “I know that my words are true, Martin. She told me that she had never ceased to think of you, and yet she knew not who you were, when she told me this.” “But now that she knows—” “She knew before we saw you on the rock, for I told her that the lad she loved to remember so fondly was my boy—my lost, (but now found) child.” “And what said she then?” “It bound her at once to me, like a daughter to her mother.” “Oh, sweet words.” “She said that I was dear to her from that moment.” “Noble maiden! She did not despise me, then. Even when she knew was of poor and humble origin.” “No, Martin, I thought she seemed pleased to learn that it was my son she had so long loved.” “Loved? Your confident words amaze and overpower me.” “Yet the maiden loves thee, Martin, and the only fear and the only doubt that at this moment lies at her heart, is that you may not requite that love.” “I? I have assured her as far as I dared to, that she was dearer to me than my life.” “Then she will be happy. You know not how deep and strong her love is for you, Martin. She told me that she always lived in the hope of one day seeing you again, with whom she had had but one interview, but in which one she had lost to you her youthful heart.” “Talk to me thus forever, my dear mother.” “Thus we were conversing, when I heard you, my boy, swimming towards the shore. Little did we suspect who it was our sympathies were awakened for, as we hastened to your relief.— God rewarded our benevolence by giving to me my son,—to the maiden, him who had so long filled her heart.” “Oh, what precious words drop from your lips! I must dream, mother!— This hour is too happy for waking life. But I cannot dare hope. She will tomorrow laugh at the sailor she has to-night taken pity on, when he dares to lift his eyes in devoted passion to her face.” “You know not of whom you speak, Martin. Barbara Frankland has a soul superior to every sordid consideration. She loves you!” “I am perfectly happy. I have looked forward with wild dreams into such a future as this; but never hoped to realise it. How many an hour have I passed in foreign seas, as I have paced the deck in my lonely watch, framing romances of love, of which the beautiful shell-girl was the heroine; but this hour surpasses them all. Dare I indeed hope, my mother?” “Hope, for she loves thee!” “I dare not hope, till I learn from her own lips my fate. It would be presumption in me to hope—” “Come with me, quickly! I hear a shouting! Thy enemies may be upon thee!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XXIII. The mother of the young seaman hastened to hide him from the pursuit of the enemies which she supposed, from the loud shouts which had reached her ears, to be close upon them. She took him by the arm and led him to a small inner room, or closet, the door of which she closed behind her. Then setting the light down upon the floor, she removed two boards in the side of the closet, and exposed a recess about two feet deep and six feet in breadth, large enough to contain two persons, or one both to sit and lie down with ease. “Here, Martin, you will be safe,” she said, thrusting him in. “I will come back to you as soon as I find all is quiet.” She hastened to the outer door, her fears for his safety greatly relieved by a sense of his security in the hiding-place in which she had left him, and bent her ear to listen to the cries of new and stranger sounds that reached her from the town. “There is something going on more than usual,” she exclaimed, as a sudden and louder shout than all was borne to her ears. “I will see what it is. They seem to be farther off than they sounded at first. I will go up no the hill-side, and see if I can make out anything. My dear boy 'll be safe where he is.” Satisfied, after a few moments' survery, that the voices and shouts which her fears had led her to refer to enemies in pursuit of the fugitive, proceeded from the wharves and from the towns-people, she resolved to hasten forward to learn the cause. “I will not be ten minutes away, and my boy 'll be safe the while, for I must needs know what all this means. It may concern him and his safety for me to know. No one will think of coming after him in the short time I am absent, and if they should, they will never find him. Had I jewels and gold untold, I would hide them there and feel that they was safe. I suspect that the brig is Mr. Frankland's, and that they are landing the cargo without duty, but I will soon learn, and be back to my boy in a few minutes.” Thus speaking, and hastening forward as she spoke, Margaret Manwaring hurried along the path which led along the curve of the shore towards the town. She soon entered the first street of the suburb, and came upon persons hurrying towards the pier; while in the doors and windows stood women and children in much alarm and excitement. “What is all this, friends?” she asked, addressing two men who were just coming from a ship, with difficulty tearing themselves from their terrified wives. “Ah, mad Margaret, now is the time for spells and witchcraft,” said one of the men. “Here is Mr. Frankland's brig come in to the wharf, and is to be unloaded to-night, they say, in spite of the war-ships. Old Mr. Frankland 'll give you a pound of silver, if you'll spirit his goods into his store-house for him.” “Alas!” ejaculated Margaret, “I shall always be held as mad! I must with my boy, fly these scenes of the past five years, if I would live in peace.” And thus saying, she passed on her way without speaking or taking any notice of the remarks which had been made by the man. “Mag is in one of her sullen fits tonight,” said as overgrown boy, who was hastening past with others, towards the scene of excitement on the wharf. “I know what it is, and why need I go farther, to be thus assailed, now that I am in my right mind?” she said with deep emotion. “I will return and relieve the anxieties of my dear boy. Mad Margaret! how this name that I once could hear with indifference or laughter, now grates upon my ears. I will not remain in Newport, where my son can hear these words. They would break his noble heart.” Thus speaking, she turned to retrace her steps, when a person coming from the direction in which she still heard the shouts of the people brushed past.— She instantly recognised him as the negro slave of Miss Frankland. She advanced, and caught him by the arm. “Where is your master?” she cried, in a quick, earnest tone. “He board de brig. Don't stop me, mad Margaret. Massa Frankland sent me tell Missy Barbara not be frightened, and stay at home till he comes up to de house.” “Are they unloading the brig?” “Guess dey be! Got him cargo mos' half out reddy! Nebber see ship unload quarter so soon as de Free-Trader, dis time. But don't stop me, ma'am, coz I got to get massa's key and carry to him, 'sides tellin' Missy Barbara not to come down to de wharf wid ebbery body else, coz dere is half de town coming.” “But your master is mad to attempt to unload his brig. He will lose his vessel.” “Massa know what he 'bout. Me hab seen fightin' to-night down the bay! I nebber know how loud cannon go afore! But don't keep me, coz massa Frankland want de key ob his desk.” “Stay! Did you hear anything about any English boats coming on shore after deserters?” “Dey not come as I know! Dey keep off, I guess, coz de town be fairly up, an' too strong for 'em!” With these words the negro broke from her, and hastened on his way. Margaret remained standing a moment where he had left her, as if reflecting as to the course of conduct she should take, and then turning, followed him with rapid strides. Barbara Frankland, in the meanwhile, after her departure from the cottage, had reached home. During her lonely and hurried walk in the darkness, she had hardly leisure to dwell upon the events which had just passed; but when she had reached her roem and began to reflect upon them, she felt her heart overflowing, she knew not wherefore, with joy; and hopes altogether new, filled her bosom. “Bless me, Miss Barbara,” said her faithful maid, Edith, coming in a few minutes after her mistress; “where have you been out so late? I have been into all the neighbors for you; and was just going down to mad Margaret's hut, to see if you had not gone there, when the ostler said he saw you come in by the garden! Where have you been? and all this firing of cannon too, down the bay, as if a terrible battle was a-fighten! I am so rejoiced to see you safe! But where is Mr. Frankland? And how happy you look, and so flushed! Dear me! Where have you been? I know you have seen mad Margaret, and she has told you some great good fortune! Did you see her, as I advised you, and tell her all the dream? And what did she say it was?” “What a tongue you have, Edith! You can put more questions into one speech than anybody I ever heard!” “But I have been so frightened about you, and so dark as it is!” “Well, I have been safe. I went to Margaret, or rather Mrs. Manwaring; for she has recovered her reason in a most extraordinary manner.” “Got her senses back again! Dear me!” exclaimed Edith, who was a short, fat, good-natured little body, of eight-and-twenty, with a great deal of good sense, combined with credulity and harmless superstition. “Yes; and if you must know, I have told her my dream, and—and—” “The bird is yourself! Didn't she say so?” “You are as great a witch as she is, Edith!” “Then I guessed right! And the young man with the cage is to be your husband!” “I don't know that! But one thing is certain, that I have seen this very night the very young man that held the cage in the dream!” “Seen him! Seen the young man alive, and sure enough!” “Yes, Edith.” “Where? When? Do tell me, Miss Barbara! You know you always tell me all your secrets!” “Well, it is very extraordinary, altogether! I will tell you all I can!” “No, no! I want to know all!” “Well you shall know most all! I went to the hut of Mrs. Manwaring, and took tea with her, and—” “Did she turn up the tea-cup, or did you, to see the grounds?” “Neither of us! But you must not inte rrupt me!” “Well, I won't; Oh, I am so impatient! Seen the very young man! Oh, how odd! It makes me afraid! How was it? and where is he? Why didn't—” —“If you are going to ask so many questions—” —“Well, I am silent. Not another word from my lips!” and Edith held firmly two of her fingers upon her mouth, to seal it. “After tea Mrs. Manwaring—” “Do you mean mad Margaret?” “Don't call her so, Edith. She is herself now since the extraordinary occurrences of to-night!” “Do let me hear?” “She offered to walk homeward with me; and on the way, as we were passing round the rock where the three pines grow, we heard a person swiming towards the shore. It was dark, but we could ascertain he was struggling hard for his life. We hastened to his aid; but we had to go round some ways on account of the steep rocks, and when we reached the place where we expected him to land, we saw him lying upon the Carved-Rock, and nearly insensible. But he soon revived, and told us that he was a pressed sailor, who had made his escape from the sloop of war.” “Poor young man! I'll warrant Margaret felt for him, on account of her own son, and offered to take him home!” “She did! And especially when she discovered that it was her own son!” “Her own son! What! Martin Manwaring?” “Yes. It was none other than he.” “How wonderful! Where is he?” “At her hut, as you may suppose. The sight of him restored her to herself completely.” “I am so glad for her and for him! He was a handsome, noble boy, I remember. How strange he should have swam ashore and been found by his own mother!” “But stranger, still, when I saw his face by the light, I recognised in him the very young man I had seen in my dream!” “Oh, when will wonders end!” “The likeness flashed upon me so suddenly, that it was with great difficulty I could command my self-possession, or keep from fainting with surprise. But I succeeded in concealing my emotion both from him and his mother, who was too much overjoyed with having recovered him, that she had eyes for no one else but him.” “The very young man in the dream! Was ever the like heard! Exactly?” “Dress and features, and tone of the voice! It was in fact the same, only he had no cage in his hand, and I was awake instead of dreaming. Yet it seems almost like a dream.” “And yet you don't seem to be disappointed, Miss Barbara, that he should turn out to be Margaret Manwaring's son! For it stands to reason, you know, that you will have to be his wife!” “Indeed!” exclaimed Barbara, with a stare of surprise, beneath which played a half smile. “Yes; you can't act contrary from dreams and be lucky! What a pity!” “What is a pity?” “That it should turn out to be, Margaret's son! Only a poor seaman it may be.” “Was he not in the dream only a sailor?” “That is true? I did not think of that! But then it might have been a prince or nobleman in disguise. That is what I hoped.” `I am content as it is, Edith,” answered Barbara, quietly. “Content! What, to marry Martin Manwaring! Dear bless me! What will happen next?” “Edith,” said Barbara, in a low, impressive tone, as if telling a great secret, “do you know I have seen grown to be a handsome young man, the lad who gave me the shells?” “There! I am silenced now! Tell me next that the world is coming to an end to-morrow, and I'll believe it! Is it true?” “Yes! You know I have said I could never love any one else.” “Yes. And as you say you have seen him, you will have to marry him. I hope he is, at least, one of the officers of this war-ship.', “It is none other,” she answered with a a smile, “than the young sailor of my dream, Martin Manwaring.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XXIV. The surprise of Edith at this revelation had scarcely had time to express itself in words of exclamation, when the shouts of the people on the wharves reached their ears. Barbara hastened to the cupola of the house to see if she could ascertain the cause; and beholding the numerous lights moving, and still hearing the noise and uproar of voices, solicitous for her father's safety, she resolved to go down and ascertain what it meant. But before she haad got many steps from the house, followed by the trembling Edith, who would have dissuaded her from going, she fell in with several persons, who told her that her father's brig had arrived, and that the towns-people were resolved to aid him in landing the cargo, in spite of the British ship, or of the Commissioners. Her anxiety now increased, and coming to a group of women and old people, who were gathered at a point from which the brig and multitude were visible, she paused to hear their accounts of the matter; and being entreated not to go nearer the scene, she lingered with them, sending forward two lads to ascertain where her father was. But they had not been gone many minutes before the African slave came past on his way to the house. He was at once recognized by several persons as he hurried by, and his name was spoken out. Barbara called him to her and said in a hurried voice that betrayed her deep solicitude, “Where is my father? Is he safe?” “Ah, bress my soul! I grad to find you Miss Barbara,” responded the negro, taking off his hat as he approached her. “Yis, massa safe, and in de brig! He send me to tell you stay home and not be alarmed for him; that all will be safe in the end!” “I trust so. Are they getting out the cargo?” “It most half out already! I nebber see men work so in my life! Money nebber make 'em work in dat a-way!— but I can't stop here, Missus! Massa wants me to bring him de key ob his desk! He forget him!” “You know where it is! Hasten, then, and take it to him; and beg him to keep out of danger.” “Dat I will, Missy. But we hab been in danger enuff to-night.” “Yes, the firing! What caused it?” “A British schooner fired her big guns at us to stop us. But we got up and leff 'em behind us on a bar! Dey no catch us.” Thus saying, and ending his words with a laugh, the negro proceeded on his way, but he had gone but a few rods when several persons cried “Here comes Mad Margaret?” and at the same moment she appeared; for as several of the women held candles or lanterns in their hands, her face was plainly visible. Hearing herself spoken of in this manner now became so painful to her, she was passing on, when her eye fell upon Barbara Frankland. “Ah, maiden, are you here also?— This is a stirring and eventful night.— All the town, as far as I have been, is up and in the doors, or in the street.” “Where have you been, Mag?” “How will the king take this night's work, Margy?” “Tell us whether the ship will fire upon us?” were the questions put to her by the thoughtless crowd. “I can tell nothing, my friends,” she said, calmly. “Good people,” spoke Barbara aloud, “it must be painful for this excellent woman to be regarded in the light of a fortune-teller as heretofore; for she has been recently restored to her reason in a most wonderful manner! Believe me, that she is this night as much in her right mind as any one of us. I know you will rejoice to hear this.” “We do! we do! Blessings on her and long life to her!” cried several persons. “But it is a strange thing!” “It may seem a strange thing to you, my towns-folk and neighbors,” said Margaret, standing before them, and addressing them in a tone of quiet dignity, while her face and whole demeanor bore testimony to the truth of the maiden's words: “but when I tell you that the same cause which deprived me of my reason has restored it to me, and that it is my son! You all know it was his loss that made me what I have been in five years past. He this night came back to me, and has been folded to my bosom a noble looking young man! He escaped from the sloop-of-war now anchored in the harbor, by swimming ashore! He is now free as you or I! But lest there may be foes to him in this crowd, I will not tell you where he is, only that he is safe where the power of England's King can not reach him!” At these words, there was a general exclamation from those around, and they overwhelmed Margaret with congratulations upon the happiness she had received. In the midst of it she glided away from them and hastened homeward. She had not gone far before Barbara was at her side. “Margaret, where have you left him?” she asked earnestly. “Safe! I left him to come into the town to know what all this uproar and shouting meant. At first I feared it was made by his enemies in searching for him. I am now hastening back to him. He will be impatient at my long absence.” “I will go with you. I have sent Edith home, and can go with you, as I shall not see my father for some time. Besides I wish to know that the brave Martin is safely hidden from his foes. I fear you were imprudent in making known so publicly that he was on shore. There may have been king's partisans in the crowd. They will direct any boat's crew to your house.” “I could not help telling my joy to them all. But they can never find him!” “My object in going with you now, Margaret, is to have his safety cared for, now that you have betrayed him unintentionally. He must find an asylum in my father's house. His pursuers would not hesitate to set fire to your cabin, if they suspected he was concealed within it.” “You are righ! A boat's crew might land and he would fall into their power or perish in the flames. Let us hasten; my heart faints already lest he should be in danger at this moment.— You shall have charge of his safety; for I know, maiden, his safety is dear to you, poor and humble as he is by birth.” “I will not disguise from you my true feelings, Margaret. His safety is dear, very dear to me.” “And thy own love for my noble boy is responded to in every fibre of his heart, maiden.” “Hast thou talked with him?” “Yes; and he loves thee with all his being. But he fears and despairs, for thou art rich and—” “If I am rich it is to enrich him, Margaret. If he thinks of me as you say, I and all mine belong to him; for where I have given my heart, I withhold nothing that is of lesser value. Hist! I hear oars.” “It is a boat; let us hasten. It may be coming for him.” They soon reached the cabin. All was quiet; but the boat was visible rowing towards it. It seemed full of men. “I will get him out, and we will go up round the hill with him, and so to your house through the garden,” said Margaret. “He will be safer there.” With these words she entered the hut and hastened to the hiding-place.— In a low voice she called her son by name, and receiving no reply, proceeded in the darkness to feel for the boards to remove them, when she found that one of them was displaced. She quickly put her arm in and felt all about the closet for him, but found only vacancy. She called his name repeatedly and in accents of anguish. “Speak, Martin! It is your mother that calls. If you are here, answer me, or I shall die.” There was no reply. Barbara called to him also, but received no answer. “Strike a light, Margaret,” she said earnestly, “for he may have fainted and be lying near us.” The light was soon made and the closet and rooms examined. It was evident to both, that he had left his place of concealment voluntarily, or been taken by enemies. In their surprise and alarm they both forgot the approaching boat; and while they were still wondering at the cause of his absence, the door of the hut was filled with rough men; and two petty officers entered, armed with swords. One of them was the gunner of the Gaspee. “Guard all the outlets, while we search for him in the house,” he cried. “So, who are you?” he added addressing Margaret, behind whom Barbara involuntarily shrunk. “I am the owner of this house, and demand to know the meaning of this intrusion?” she answered firmly, and with a secret joy; for she now knew from the first words he had uttered that her son was not yet re-taken as she had feared. “We come in the king's name for a deserter, called Martin Manwaring; and we have reason to believe he is here.” “He is not.” “We will soon see. Search lads, every locker and every hole. We'll have him if he is to be found in this old hulk here. Ah, what beauty is this?— A lady, by the beard of Old Nep! Come, young, mistress, where have you hid the young larkee?” “Don't address this young lady rudely, sir,” said Margaret, sternly.— “She is rich and high-born, the daughter of Mr. Frankland.” “The daughter of the owner of the brig, Mr. Officer,” said a red faced man, stepping up, “and you had best take her on board as security for her father's behavior.” “A good thought,” answered the gunner, “but who are you?” “I am a citizen of the town, a butcher, and a good friend to the king,” answered the man. It was me that hailed your boat five minutes ago, as you were pulling up towards the town, and told you if you wanted to catch a deserter, to land in here. And I know that he is here, for I heard his mother, there not a quarter of an hour ago say that she had seen him to-night. Don't give up the search! But an't any of the sloop's boats coming to see about this brig's cargo, landing as is?” “I don't know. Our boat belongs to the Gaspee, and we are going up to see what has become of a brig that got by us, and to know the meaning of the shouts. The Bexley's boats haven't yet reached the ship from an expedition down the bay. There is our Captain Arling and ten men in the boat, besides what is here, and when he heard your hail, he put right in here, (for the Bexley's boats told us about the deserter,) and sent me up to catch the runaway; for they mean to make an example of him. Do you see any thing in that room, lads? Have you searched it through?” “Not a kitten could escape us,” answered one of the men. The house was thoroughly searched, and as no trace of the fugitive was discovered, the party took its leave, the boatswain following the advice of the butcher, and taking captive with him Barbara Frankland. She saw that resistance would be vain, and believing that the officer in the boat would order her release as soon as he beheld her, she bade Margaret not to rouse the fierce anger of the men, by attempting to defend her, but go and inform her father the fate which had befallen her, if she should be carried on board the Bexley. Margaret, filled with grief and rage, at seeing the maiden led off by the gunner, followed them to the boat. Here Arling being told of the flight of the deserter from the house, and the capture of the daughter of Mr. Frankland, said: “This fair prisoner will do better than the other! Come, Miss Frankland, you shall shall be my guest.— Your father has proved himself traitor to the crown, and we will have you as a guarantee for his good behavior.” In vain Barbara appealed to his humanity and manliness. He drew her by the hand into the boat, and forcing Margaret back with the oars of his men, ordered them to pull back to the Gaspee. “To the Gaspee?” exclaimed the midshipman, who acted as coxswain. “Yes. Obey and ask no questions.” The boat darted away from the shore with her prow down the bay, and in three quarters of an hour reached the schooner. Arling, with a show of gallantry, escorted his beautiful captive to the cabin. Barbara saw that quiet submission to her captivity was the only judicious course. She believed that she would soon be released, and while she was indignant at the conduct of Arling in taking her prisoner, she would not let him see that she was alarmed at all. On the way to the Gaspee, he had tried to converse with her, but she invariably preserved the stillest silence, replying to no question. Yet all the while she was wondering where she had heard the voice. It was too dark to see his face in the boat, but on entering the lighted cabin, she turned quickly upon him to gratify her curiosity, when she was stupefied with surprise and displeasure. “Lieutenant Arling!” “Yes, Miss Frankland, your most devoted admirer!” he answered, smiling. “Little did I anticipate, two hours ago, the happiness of having you as my guest. Two years ago in Boston, you disdained the offer of my hand: now that fortune has thrown you into my power, I will give you an opportunity to change your mind.” “Sir, this insult to a lady—” “Nay, I treat you with the greatest courtesy. This cabin is at your disposal. I leave you here to reflect upon the offer which I once more renew to you Your father, if all I hear is true, has forfeited his head by this night's doings. You will need a protector. I will be that one.” “I cannot prevent you from saying what you will, sir, but I shall act independently and fearlessly, though a captain. I now tell you, sir, you have even less hope than ever. I despise and scorn you.” “Very well. I will give you a night to think of it. I must now return to the town, and also see Sir William Petty!” With these words he left her with an elegant bow and a smile, and she soon afterwards heard his boat rowing away from the schooner. Leaving Barbara Frankland in her sudden and singular captivity, we will now return to Martin Manwaring.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XXV. After Margaret had left our youthful hero in his concealment, the continued and increased shouting which reached his ears from the town excited his anxiety. Finding that his mother's absence was prolonged, and impatient at his confinement, and being of a spirit too brave and daring to submit long to such a mode of concealment to escape his foes, he resolved to free himself from his hiding place. After some difficulty, he succeeded in removing one of the panels and emerging into the cottage. Listening and finding all about it still, though he saw the lights and heard the hurrahs in the town, he resolved to hasten thither. For this purpose he threw on an old cloak of his mother's, and a straw hat that she had worn in her fortune-telling wanderings, though he was not aware of it. To avoid a meeting with her and thus be stopped on his way, he followed the steep hill-path, and coming round in the rear of Mr. Manning's gardens, he at length reached the streets of the town. He walked on with a familiar step, and soon came upon some people who were talking together with much excitement. From their conversation he learned the cause of the agitation in the town, and of the hurrahs, and of the crowd upon the pier. His heart bounded with joy, that there was found one American merchant who dared to set at defiance the unjust laws of the crown; and he rejoiced that his townsmen had patriotism enough in their bosoms to aid him. “I, too, will aid in unloading the brig,” he said, as he left the group and hastened to the wharf. When he reached it, he could hardly make his way to the vessel for the multitude. Finding, from their exclamations and questions as he passed, that he was taken for his mother in her deranged state, he took an opportunity to throw aside the cloak and hat, saying, “I need not fear arrest among so many good patriots, even should the Bexley's whole crew come on shore for me!” The next moment, bare-headed and with his flowing locks scarcely dry from the salt water in which they with his dress had been saturated, he appeared among the people, who, by the light of a score of lanterns, placed in the windows and doors of the store-house, and held by men in the rigging of the Free-Trader, were at work unlading her. There were at least forty men at work in their shirt-sleeves, some in the hold breaking up the cargo, some hooking it on to be hoisted others at the fall, others rolling it across the deck to men in the store-house. Such a scene of excitement he had never before witnessed; and burning with the wrongs he had received from the English, his heart was with them. He at once leaped on board and took hold with them. A sailor himself, he soon made himself conspicuous among the townsmen by his skill and adroitness. “Who is that young man?” asked Mr. Frankland. “He has given them all new life by his example and words. Who is he?” No one could tell him. No one recognized him. Yet he had not been twenty minutes at work with them before all yielded to him the direction of the discharging. The cargo had now nearly been hoisted out when there was a cry. “The sloop-of-war's boats are coming full of men!” At this, the timid and cautious fled, and left only the bold. “I want no blood shed, my friends,” said Mr. Frankland. “There are only two or three more pipes of wine left.— Let them be; and all of you who have done me and your country such good service to-night, hasten to leave her, that you may not be marked as being engaged in the work! They may take my vessel if they will!” “We will have the three pipes up-first, my friends,” cried Martin. “We will not leave them a single glass of wine!” The men sprang to the work, and while they were hoisting, Mr. Frankland was hailed from the leading boat; for as soon as the sloop's boats reached the ship from down the bay, Sir William had arrived and sent them to the town to cut out the brig; the unloading of which by the town's-people he had heard of in the beginning by one of the crown's men who had gone off in a skiff to report. Arling, instead of going with the boats direct to the Bexley, turned aside, as we have seen, to pull to the brig, which he was desirous of being the first to board; but which, after stopping to arrest the deserter, he was willing to forego for the greater gratification of conveying Barbara Frankland to his vessel. “Brig ahoy!” hailed the leading boat. “Well, the boats! What do you wish?” returned the merchant, firmly. “Is that the Free-Trader?” “Yes.” “Then I demand you to surrender her to me in the King's name!” “She makes no resistance to the king, neither do I. Come on board when you please, sir. But you will take possession of her at the peril of being answerable for all damages to my property!” “I'll take that look-out,” answered the officer. “Pull away, men.” Still the officer approached cautiously; for there were visible, standing quietly upon the wharf and shore, a large number of people; and he did not know but that he might yet get a hostile reception. In the meanwhile the last pipe had been hoisted and rolled across the deck. “My friends, a thousand thanks, and you, young man, in particular,” said the merchant. “Now lea ve quickly and mingle with the crowd looking on. Do not be seen on board. I will take care of my own vessel!” “If you wish to defend her, sir,” said Martin, we will keep them off.” “It would be useless, and cause bloodshed, my brave young friend. They will only put a guard on board, and let her remain at the wharf. They have no idea the dutiable goods are all on shore, and will only board the brig to keep them from being landed. You have my thanks for what you have done. Hasten on shore!” “You must go also, Mr. Frankland,” said Martin, with firmness, feeling solicitous for the safety of the father of Barbara. “The officers are irritative, and will do violence to you. Come with us, sir, and we will go. Your presence alone on board will do no good! You have others who are deeply interested in your safety, sir.” “True! I will go! I can do no good by remaining. I have done my duty thus far in resisting the unjust revenue law! I will leave with you.” Thus speaking, the merchant went to the stern, from which the leading boa was not three fathoms distant, and said, “Mr. officer, I cannot defend my brig, or I would do so. I leave her to you and make you answerable. You will find the commissioner of the crown a prisoner in the cabin, and will do him a favor to release him as early as convenient. You will also find the tide-waiter there!” Mr. Frankland then crossed his brig's deck and stepped on shore, followed by Martin and two or three others who had lingered behind. The next moment the officer had boarded, sword in hand, as if he expected resistance. But he found the deck vacant. Ordering his men to different points of the vessel to hold its possession, he descended into the cabin, and in a few minutes returned with the commissioner who was eloquently re counting his wrongs, to which the lieutenant listened with much excitement-especially when he heard of the Gas, pee's boats. “The vessel shall be taken from the town and anchored under the Gaspee's guns,” he exclaimed, fiercely.— “She is a fair prize to the crown.— To-morrow we will look up these rebels who have now fled to the shore and mixed with the crowd. Cast off the hawsers fore and aft, and away aloft there, some of you and loose the top sails!” he shouted. In a few minutes the brig was freed from her fastenings to the pier, and under her jib, topsail and tri-sail, slowly moved away from the crowded wharf and steered for the Bexley. All this while the multitude looked on, but made no effort to resist this movement, being restrained by Mr. Frankland, who bade them let the brig go; “for,” said he, “they dare not keep her! The whole province would be on fire! The king would lose his colonies by such an act of aggression; my conduct for this night will be hailed with acclamation throughout the land! Let the brig go!” The multitude, nevertheless, gave vent to their feelings in groans and jeers, and occasional shouts of derision and defiance.' Mr. Frankland, surrounded by his more immediate friends, stood on the pier and watched the receding brig till it could be only indistinctly seen in the distance. “She has come to anchor, sir,” said Martin, who stood close at his side, feeling, for Barbara's sake, a regard for him that partook of affection. “You have good eyes, young man.” “I can see that she has clued up her topsails and swung round to the current.” “Yes, that is true. I can make out that. The brig is fairly in their power. I may lose her, and her cargo, but, I am willing to do so. I am able to bear the loss, and am ready to bear it, for the sake of showing my countrymen how far the English will go in oppression; and to show the English how far we will go in resisting it.” “But, sir, if you will give your consent, the brig will not be long in their hands,” said Martin. “We can rescue her.” “Who are you, brave young man?” demanded the merchant, with surprise. “I am but a poor Newport boy, sir, was impressed five years ago by our tyrants. This night I made my escape from the Bexley by swimming on shore, and I am thankful that it has been my good fortune to be here at this time to show my defiance of our oppressors.” There was a loud shout of applause at his words. “What is his name? Who is it?” demanded a score of voices. “Yes, thy name, young gentleman,” said the merchant, taking him by the hand and looking him steadily in the face. Martin had not time to reply; for at the same instant Margaret came foreing her way and crying, “The British have landed in a boat and carried off thy daughter, Mr. Frankland.” At this announcement there was a general outcry of surprise and indignation. Margaret briefly explained the facts and made known to them that it was the captain of the Gaspee, who had gone down to his schooner, as she had watched and seen, with his captive. “Mother, tell me if this is true indeed?” cried Martin, clasping her hands in his, almost before she recognized him. “Heaven be thanked! Here is my son! Safe! Thou art safe.” “Who knows where the Gaspee lies?” cried Martin, in a voice that betrayed the depth of his emotion. “I do, Martin Manwaring,” answered Mate Finch, “My friends, this brave young sailor turns out to be Margaret's son. Welcome him back.” “Hurrah for Martin Manwaring.— Long life to the brave Newport boy.” “Who will volunteer to go with me to the rescue of Mr. Frankland's daughter?” he cried. “I! I! I! I!” cried one after another, till it seemed a hundred men responded in the affirmative. “My child! my poor child!” cried the merchant, for the first time able to speak, so overwhelmed had he been by the intelligence; for he thought at once that they had taken her as a hostage. “Sir,” said Martin; “I am going to receive her. She shall be restored to your arms ere the sun again rise.” “Heaven bless you and prosper you.” “My friends, let as many boats as can be got together in ten minutes be filled with armed men and brought round to the pier. We will first take the brig from under the very guns of the Bexley, and in her bear down upon the Gaspee, which lays aground. This will be the most sure and expeditious way; for they will not be prepared to defend the brig. If we fail in taking her as we pass, we will row on and attack the Gaspee with the boats. Let me know how many men will go. As I count, respond.” He counted up to one hundred and seventy with a hearty-response at each number. “It is enough! Now to your boats.” Those were soon obtained, for nearly every citizen who dwelt near the shore owned one or more. Within half an hour, thirty boats, with full two hundred men armed as they could be at such short notice, gathered about the pierhead. Into one of them Martin, Mr. Frankland, who insisted upon going, Mate Finch and ten othors, well armed, embarked. To Martin, every man with one consent, yielded the direction of the enterprise. In less than four minutes after she was boarded, the Free-Trader was taken, put under sail, and standing down the bay, under a heavy fire from the sloop, which, on discovering the movement, opened her batteries; ihe brig having been anchored forward of her beam, she could only bring three or four of her forward guns to bear upon her without working round, and before she effected the manæuvre, the brig was beyond reach of her shot; nevertheless she was hulled twice by the first fire, and her main-topsail was shot from the slings. Still Martin stood on; and Mate Finch, keeping a sharp look-out for the Gaspee, reported a boat coming up, which as it came nearer and saw the flotilla of boats about the brig, for every boat of the thirty was alongside with two or three men in it, put about, Chase was given, but by superior rowing and fleetness, it escaped to the shore; and from the land, Arling, for it was he, on his way up to the town, beheld, by the light of her own guns, the Gaspee attacked, boarded, and captured; for the brig bore directly down upon her, and laid her along-side, and indifferent to her fire, poured her two hundred men along her deck. Martin found Barbara in the cabin, and taking her hand, he led her to her father, who embraced her with tears of joy. “Thank not me, my child, but this noble and brave young man!” said her father. “He has conducted this enterprise and rescued you.” “Father, I know not how to thank him! If he will accept my poor hand, it is his! Do not start, sir! We have known each other and met before. Our hearts have long been bound together. We only ask your consent that our hands man be united also.” “You have it! I could give you to no one more worthy of you. But I am amazed! But you shall explain all by and by. Mr. Manwaring, here is my child. You have won her! She says you love each other! Take her; and my blessing with her!” We will not dwell upon the happiness and gratitude of the lovers.— piness was soon called to the stern duties of a conqueror and captor, and gave orders to set the Gaspee on fire. Mate Finch was the last to leave her, lighting the train with his own hand From the boats and the brig, which, drawing two feet less water than the schooner, safely floated, and was steered away from the prize, with the British crew prisoners on board, they beheld the blaze seize upon the vessel, and entwine like serpents about the masts and cordage. After the masts fell, she blew up with an explosion that was heard, and a light that was seen for thirty miles around. Mate Finch now selected, at Mr. Frankland's suggestion, a crew of ten men from those on board and in the boats; and made sail for some distant port known only to himself and the merchant: thus effectually putting the brig beyond the reach of the British.— The rest, with Martin, Mr. Frankland, and Barbara, pulled for shore, and keeping close in with it, in an hour reached Newport, passing on their way, but too far to be seen by her, the sloop-of-war under full sail down the bay in chase of the brig. The marriage of Barbara Frankland with the youthful hero of our story, took placo four months after the events just related, when the safety of the merchant and of all concerned in the affair of the Free-Trader was secured by a pardon from the crown, and a modification of the unjust revenue laws: for the ministry saw in the resistance made in Newport, and in the feeling of patriotic sympathy which it awakened throughout the provinces, that it would not be safe to press free men too free; and that the men of America were made of different material than the willing serfs of Europe. Nevertheless, the crown, soon forgetting their lesson, began to enact other oppressive laws, which, ere four years expired, caused the thirteen colonies to revolt and pronounce to the world their independence to the mother country! “Is it not thy dream all realized, daughter?” said Margaret Manwaring, as she smiled upon her blushing daughter-in-law on the evening of her bridal. THE END.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ISABEL OF BAVARIA: OR, THE CHRONICLES OF FRANCE FOR THE Reign of Charles the Sixth. TRANSLATED FROM THE FRENCH OF ALEXANDRE DUMAS, AUTHOR OF “DIANA OF MERIDOR,” “MEMOIRS OF A PHYSICIAN,” &amp;c. Price Fifty Cents, Complete. It has been frequently remarked, that the romance of real life abounds wita events infinitely more extraordinary and interesting than anything that has ever emanated from the imagination of the poet or the novelist; and a persual of the following pages will amply prove the truth of this assertion. After a careful examination of the sources from which the author professes to have derived his materials, the Translator is satisfied that every event recorded in these Chronicles is historically correct in all its most important features, and that the characters here depicted are genuine representations of the originals. That vividness of style and those animated descriptions in which M. Dumas so greatly excels, may not, in the translation, be found to possess all their original brilliance; but the utmost care has been taken to preserve the many useful lessons that may be derived from this diffuse yet minute sketch. Much vice is here portrayed, without offending delicacy; and the description of those turbulent times of old—of bigotry combined with loose morality—of unlimited power with impotent laws—may induce us to congratulate ourselves that we live in an age when Christianity is something more than a name, and the laws by which society are regulated and controlled something more than a dry inefficient code. A few notes, in addition to those in the original, have been appended by the translator; and for these, which cannot be mistaken, he alone must be held responsible. It is therefore at St. Denis, since we are there, that we will open the mysterious archives of that singular reign, which passed, as says one of our poets, “between the vision of an old man and that of a shepherdess; and which left, as the only memorial of its duration—a bitter sarcasm on the destiny of empires and the fortune of men—a pack of cards.” For some fair pages that this book will contain, we shall meet many red with blood, many dark with mourning; for providence willed that all here below should be tinged with these three colors, when it instituted the heraldry of human life, and gave to it for a device—innocence, passions, and death. Let us now open this book, as God opens life, at its fair pages: we shall soon enough arrive at its pages of blood and of mourning.
