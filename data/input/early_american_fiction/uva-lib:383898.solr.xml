      <field name="fulltext">PRESIDENT LINCOLN'S INDORSEMENT OF NASBY. The subjoined account of President Lincoln's high appreciation of the wit and humor of Nasby was contributed to the New York Independent, by F. B. Carpenter, Esq., the artist, who enjoyed the confidence of our late lamented Chief Magistrate, and whose reminiscences have an authenticity entitling them to implicit credit. Mr. Carpenter says: “The Saturday evening before President Lincoln left Washington, to go to the front, just previous to the capture of Richmond, I was with him from seven o'clock till nearly twelve. It had been a very hard day with him. The pressure of office-seekers was greater at this juncture than I ever knew it to be, and he was almost worn out. Among the callers that evening was a party composed of a Senator, a Representative, an ex-Lieutenant Governor of a Western State, and several private citizens. They had business of great importance, involving the necessity of the President's examination of voluminous documents. Pushing every thing aside, he said to one of the party, `Have you seen the Nasby Papers?' `No, I have not,' was the answer. `Who is Nasby?' `There is a chap out in Ohio,' returned the President, `who has been writing a series of letters in the newspapers over the signature of Petroleum V. Nasby. Some one sent me a pamphlet collection of them the other day. I am going to write to “Petroleum” to come down here, and I intend to tell him if he will communicate his talent to me, I will swap places with him!' Thereupon he arose, went to a drawer in his desk, and taking out the `letters,' he sat down and read one to the company, finding in their enjoyment of it the temporary excitement and relief which another man would have found in a glass of grog! The instant he had ceased, the book was thrown aside, his countenance relapsed into its habitual serious expression, and the business was entered upon with the utmost earnestness.”</field>

      <field name="fulltext">2 I. HOW HE CAME TO BE A DEMOCRAT. I wuz born a Whig. My parents wuz a member uv that party, leastways my mother wuz, and she alluz did the votin, allowin my father, uv course, to go thro the manual labor uv castin the ballot, in deference to the laws uv the country, which does not permit females or niggers to vote, no matter how much intelleck they may hev in2 em. In all probability I shood hev cast my lot with that party, hed not a insident occurred, in my boyhood days, wich satisfied me that the Dimocrisy wuz my approprit and nateral abidin-place. It wuz in this wise: In a playful mood, wun nite, I bustid open a grosery, and appropriatid, ez a jest, what loose change ther wuz in the drawer, (alars! in these degenerit days uv paper currency, the enterprisin theef hez to steel at 40 per sent discount,) and sich other notions ez struck my boyish fancy. I indoost a nigger boy, sumwhat younger than myself, to aid me, and when we hed bagged the game, I, feelin in my pride ez wun hevin the proud Anglo-Sacksun blood a coursin toomulchusly thro his vanes, what Cheef-Justis Taney hez sence made law, to-wit: that the nigger hez no rites which the white man is bound to respeck, whaled him till he resined the entire proseeds uv the spekulashen to me. The degraded wretch, devoid uv every prinsiple uv honor, blowed on me, and we wuz both arrestid. The Justis uv the Pease wuz a Whig! and after a hurried eggsaminashen, he sentenst ME! wun uv his own race! uv his own blood! uv his own parentige! to impriznment for THIRTY DAYS! on bred and water, and the nigger to only ten, on the ground that I wuz the cheef offender! My mother beggd and prayd, with teers a stremin down her venrable cheeks faster than she cood wipe em up with her gingum apern, that the arrangement mite be reverst—the nigger the 30 and I the 10—but no! Cold ez a stun, inflexible ez iron, bludlis ez a turnip, I wuz inkarseratid, and stayed my time. Sullenly I emerged from them walls, on the evenin uv the 30th day, a changed indivijoel. Liftin my hands 2 heven, I vowd 3 vows, to-wit: 1. That I wood devote my life to the work uv redoosin the Afrikin 2 his normal speer. 2. That I wood adopt a perfeshn in2 wich I cood steel without bein hauled up fer it. 3. That the water I hed consoomed while in doorance vile, wuz the last that wood ever find its way, undilootid, in2 my stumick. Hentz, I jined the Dimocrisy, and whoever eggsamines my record, will find that I hev kep my oaths!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">II. WINGERT'S CORNERS SECEDES. Wingert's Corners, March the 21st, 1861. South Carliny and sevral other uv the trooly Dimecratic States hev secesht—gone orf, I may say, onto a journey after ther rites. Wingert's Corners, ez trooly Dimecratic ez any uv em, hez follered soot. A meetin wuz held last nite, uv wich I wuz chairman, to take the matter uv our grievances in2 consideration, and it wuz finally resolved that nothin short uv seceshn wood remedy our woes. Therefore the follerin address, wich I rit, wuz adoptid and ordered to be publisht: TO THE WORLD! In takin a step wich may, possibly, involve the state uv wich we hev bin heretofore a part into blood and convulshuns, a decent respeck for the good opinion uv the world requires us to give our reasons for takin that step. Wingert's Corners hez too long submitted to the imperious dictates uv a tyranikle government. Our whole histry hez bin wun uv aggreshn on the part uv the State, and uv meek and pashent endoorence on ours. It refoosed to locate the State Capitol at the Corners, to the great detriment uv our patriotic owners uv reel estate. It refoosed to gravel the streets uv the Corners, or even re-lay the plank-road. It refoosed to locate the Penitentiary at the Corners, notwithstandin we do more towards fillin it than any town in the State. It refoosed to locate the State Fair at the Corners, blastin the hopes uv our patriotic groserys. It located the canal 100 miles from the Corners. We hev never hed a Guvner, notwithstandin the President uv this meetin hez lived here for yeers, a waitin to be urgd to accept it. It hez compelled us, yeer after yeer, to pay our share uv the taxes. It hez never appinted any citizen uv the place to any offis wher theft wuz possible, thus wilfully keepin capital away from us. It refoosed to either pay our rale-rode subscripshun or slackwater our river. Therefore, not bein in humor to longer endoor sich outrajes, we declare ourselves Free and Independent uv the State, and will maintain our position with arms, if need be. There wuz a lively time next day. A company uv minit men wuz raised, and wun uv 2 minit men. The seceshn flag, muskrat rampant, weasel couchant, on a field d'egg-shell, waves from both groserys. Our merchant feels hopeful. Cut orf from the State, direct trade with the Black Swamp follers; releest from his indebtedness to Cinsinati, he will agin lift his head. Our representative hez agreed to resine—when his term expires. We are in earnest. Armed with justice and shot-guns, we bid the tyrants defiance. P. S.—The feelin is intense—the childern hev imbibed it. A lad jest past, displayin the seceshn flag. It waved from behind. Disdainin concealment, the noble, lion-hearted boy wore a roundabout. We are firm. N. B.—We are still firm. N. B., 2d.—We are firm, unyeeldin, calm, and resoloot. Till death, Petroleum V. Nasby.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">III. NEGRO EMIGRATION. Wingert's Corners, April the 2d, 1862. There is now 15 niggers, men, wimin, and children, or ruther, mail, femail, and yung, in Wingert's Corners, and yisterday another arrove. I am bekomin alarmed, for, ef they inkreese at this rate, in suthin over sixty years they 'll hev a majority in the town, and may, ef they git mean enuff, tyrannize over us, even ez we air tyrannizin over them. The danger is imminent! Alreddy our poor white inhabitants is out uv employment to make room for that nigger; even now our shops and factories is full uv that nigger, to the grate detriment uv a white inhabitant who hez a family 2 support, and our poor hows and jail is full uv him. I imploar the peeple to wake up. Let us hold a mass meetin to take this subgik in2 considerashen, and, that biznis may be expeditid, I perpose the adopshen uv a series uv preamble and resolooshens, suthin like the follerin, to-wit: Wareas, We vew with alarm the ackshun uv the Presydent uv the U. S., in recommendin the immejit emansipashun uv the slaves uv our misgidid Suthern brethrin, and his evident intenshun uv kolonizin on em in the North, and the heft on em in Wingert's Corners; and Wareas, In the event uv this imigrashun, our fellow-townsman, Abslum Kitt, and uthers, whose familis depend upon their labor for support, wood be throde out of employment; and Wareas, When yoo giv a man a hoss, yoo air obleeged to also make him a present uv a silver-platid harnis and a ?350 buggy, so ef we let the nigger live here, we are in dooty bound to let him vote, and to marry him off-hand; and Wareas, When this stait uv affares arrives our kentry will be no fit place for men uv educashen and refinement; and Wareas, Eny man hevin the intellek uv a brass-mounted jackass kin easily see that the 2 races want never intendid to live together; and Wareas, Bein in the magority, we kin do as we please, and ez the nigger aint no vote he kant help hisself; therefore be it Resolved, That the crude, undeodorizd Afrikin is a disgustin obgik. Resolved, That this Convenshun, when it hez its feet washed, smells sweeter nor the Afrikin in his normal condishun, and is there4 his sooperior. Resolved, That the niggers be druv out uv Wingert's Corners, and that sich property ez they may hev accumulatid be confiscatid, and the proseeds applide to the follerin purposes, to-wit: Payment uv the bills of the last Dimekratik Centrel Committee. Payment uv the disintrestid patriots ez got up this meetin. The balence to remane in my hands. Resolved, That the Ablishnists who oppose these resolushens all want to marry a nigger. Resolved, That Dr. Petts, in rentin a part uv his bildin to niggers, hez struck a blow at the very foundashens uv sosiety. Fellow whites, arowz! The enemy is onto us! Our harths is in danger! When we hev a nigger for judge—niggers for teachers—niggers in pulpits—when niggers rool and controle society, then will yoo remember this warnin! Arouse to wunst! Rally agin Conway! Rally agin Sweet! Rally agin Hegler! Rally agin Hegler's family! Rally agin the porter at the Reed House! Rally agin the cook at the Crook House! Rally agin the nigger widder in Vance's Addishun! Rally agin Missis Umstid! Rally agin Missis Umstid's children by her first husband! Rally agin Missis Umstid's children by her sekkund husband! Rally agin all the rest uv Missis Umstid's children! Rally agin the nigger that cum yisterday! Rally agin the saddle-culurd girl that yoost 2 be hear! Ameriky for white men! Petroleum V. Nasby.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">V. HAS AN INTERVIEW WITH VALLANDIGHAM. Washington, Joon the 1st, 1862. I am in Washinton. I stand under the shadder uv the tempel uv Liberty, and am reposin my weery lims in the kool shades uv Fredom. But I cant reelize that this is the saim Washinton I yoost 2 visit. I yoost to go frum Pennsilvany to the cappytle wunst a year, to git my stock uv Dimocrisy recrootid, and to find out what we wuz expectid to bleeve doorin the cumin year, thus gettin full 6 munths ahed uv my nabers. I wuz wunst electid gustis uv the peese in Berks County, by knoin neerly a year in advanse what we wuz to vote for that autum. They thot Nasby wuz a smart man. 2 resoom. This is not the Washinton that wunst I knode. Our cappytle is now a Ablishn camp. The brite sun reflex glittrin raze frum shinin baynets—the ear is horrifide with the rumble uv cannon-wheels, and the iren-shod war-steed clatters on the stony street. The slavepens, them proud moniments uv the sooperiority of the Anglo-Sacksun race, hez bin swep away, and with them the heft uv the Dimocrisy. O! my country! Where is Tooms, and Yancy, and Wigfall? The lofty domes uv the cappytle dont re-ekko no more 2 their sole-inspirin voices. Ez I reflek that these pillers uv Dimocrisy aint here— and, what is wuss, that they dassent cum here— that these place that knode em wunst will kno em no more furever—my manly buzzum throbs with sorrer, and my prowd form is bowed in anguish. O thou fell sperit uv Abolishnism, thow hast much 2 anser for—mucher than thow canst anser. Wood that I cood heeve thee owt uv these sacrid precinks, and with gentle stranes woo back them ez we hev lost. Avant, thow grim and nasty cuss! my stumick heeves wheneer I think uv thee. 2 resoom. I kum hear to see Vallandygum. I huntid him up, and last nite we mingled our goys and sorrers in a talk that lasted 2 ours We hed a bottle uv concentratid contentment, and, after disposin uv a suffishensy thereof, Vallandygum commenst: “Nasby,” sez he, “we 're in a fix.” “Vallandygum,” sez I, “to wich do yoo elude— our distractid country?” “Nary,” sez he; “I wuz a speekin uv myself and the rest uv us. Them 's my country.” “Sagashus man,” sez I, “youm rite. Politerkilly we 're ez bad off ez our frends in Fort Warin is personally. We 're in a tite place.” “Yes,” sez he; “and we must git out. We must carry the North this autum.” “Certingly,” sez I; “but how?” “I hev,” sez he, “the plan uv the campane fixt. Fustly, we must oppose the wholesail votin by niggers.” “But,” sez I, “no niggers votes in the North.” “Nasby,” sez he, a puttin his thum to his nose, “a man uv straw is the eeziest knockt down, especially ef yoo hev set him up yerself for the purpos uv knockin uv him down. 2ndly, the immense emygrashun uv niggers into the North must be prohibytid.” “But,” sez I, “no niggers air comin, or hev any noshun uv comin in2 the North.” “3rdly,” sez he, “the alarmin amalgamashun uv the races must be prohibytid.” “But,” sez I, “there 's no amalgamashun north uv the Ohio River.” “4thly,” sez he, “the idee uv allowin the nigger to stand on a equality with the whites must be squelcht.” “But,” says I, “nobody wants em to be our ekals.” “5thly,” sez he, “no nigger must ever be allowd to hev offis in the North.” “But,” sez I, “nobody wants the nigger to hev offis.” “Never mind, Nasby,” sez he; “nigger is our trump card—we must lead off with it. Taxes is a good dodge, for no man likes to pay taxes, and we must werk em up on that. After nigger, compromise is our best holt. Ef, by a fair, ekitable compromise”— “To-wit, givin our Suthern brethren all they want,” murmured I— “We kin end this unnateral war,” continered he, “wich hez tored up the foundashuns uv liberty, and rent the proud old Dimekratik party in twain”— “Into 2 twains,” sighd I, like a ekkoin zephyr— “And reskoo the guverment frum the jobbers and spekulaters who now control it, and put it into the hands uv pure men”— “Sech ez Floyd, and Bright, and we,” sejestid I, smilin sweetly— “Then,” continered he, a wettin his lips at the mouth uv the bottle, “we will not hev labered in vain. To do this, and bring back the fraternal feelins uv yoar, this bluddy war must cease. O, Nasby, the Dimekratik staits is being invadid the homes uv our Suthern brethren is bein violatid, their niggers and household gods is bein torn from em; and onless we kin stand between em and rooin, will they, wen peese is restored, take us back, and give us the politikle crums they can't use?

      <field name="fulltext">VI. PROPOSES TO CELEBRATE THE FOURTH. Washington, Joon the 12th, 1862. I am still in Washinton, and wont be home for some time, on akount uv bisnis pertanin 2 the re-organizashun uv the Dimekratik party. I will give suffishent notis uv my cumin, so that my frends may git up a perceshun to escort me from the cars 2 my hotel. The objik uv this letter is 2 sejest a plan for the appropriate celebrashun uv the fourth uv 3 July—the birthday of our Liberties—the day on wich Freedum wuz perclamd too all men, exceptin niggers, and them hevin a vizable admixter uv Aferken blud, et settery. I want to see a pure Dimekratik celebrashun fer wunst, and hold up both hands fer jest sech a wun. Let me sejest the follerin order fer a perceshun: 1st. Marshel in uniform uv Home Gard, dekorated with a winder sash over the left shoulder. 2d. Banner with inskripshun, “The Yunyun ez it wuz—under Bookanun! The constitooshn ez it is, with sum variashens.” 3d. Barril contanin nativ corn joose, inskribd, “Our platform.” 4th. Carrij contanin speeker, reeder, and chaplin—wun of our perswashin kin be prokoord. 5th. Wagin with a nigger a lyin down, and mi esteemd frend Punt a standin onto him—a paregorical illustrashun uv the sooperiority uv the Anglo-Sacksun over the Afrikin rases. 6th. Soljers uv the present war. (A few may be procoord frum the military prizen at Chicago, where they are at present unconstitooshnaly confind, fer this ocashun.) 7th. The cort-house offishls, with banner and inscripshun, “Our saleries—we will defend em 2 the last.” 8th. Cittizens on hossbac with bottles. 9th. Cittizens in carrijes with bottles. 10th. Cittizens on foot with bottles. (Space on each side reserved fer cittizens a lyin down with empty bottles.) 11th. Candidates fer offis, all walkin on ther neez. Perceshun form so that the hed will rest on the distillery, and the tale on the cort-house, representin the beginnin and end uv our gellorious party. On arrivin at the grove, the follerin exercises may be had: Singin—Nashnel oad, “We 've Cuffee by de wool.” Readin Vallandigum's address. Orashun—“Nigger: his Past, Present, and Futur”—by myself. Singin—Patryotik song— “Sambo, ketch dat hoe, And resine dat vane idee; We've got de power, you kno, And you never kin be free.” Benedickshun, bi myself. In the evenin it would be appropri8 to hev fireworks, and perhaps I might be indoost to deliver an orashun on “Nigger: his Past, Present, and Futur.” Sech a celebrashun would elevate the sperits uv the faithful, and help mateerialy towards makin a triumpf this ortum.

      <field name="fulltext">VII. ANNIHILATES AN OBERLINITE. Columbus, O., June the 21st, 1862. I wuz onto my way to Columbus to attend the annooal gatherin uv the fatheful at that city, a dooty I hev religusly performd fer over 30 yeres. Ther wuz but wun seet vakent in the car, and onto that I sot down. Presently a gentleman carryin uv a carpit-bag sot down beside me, and we to wunst commenst conversashen. After discussin the crops, the wether, et settry, I askt wher he resided. “In Oberlin,” sez he. “Oberlin!” shreekt I. “Oberlin! wher Ablishnism runs rampant—wher a nigger is 100 per cent. better ner a white man—wher a mulatto is a objik uv pitty on account uv hevin white blood. Oberlin! that stonest the Dimekratik prophets, and woodent be gathered under Vallandygum's wings as a hen-hawk gathereth chickens, at no price! Oberlin, that gives all the profits uv her college to the support uv the underground rale-rode”— “But,” sez he. “Oberlin,” continyood I, “that reskoos niggers, and sets at defians the benifisent laws fer takin on em back to their kind and hevenly-minded masters! Oberlin!”— “My jentle frend,” sez he, “Oberlin do n't do nuthin uv the kind. Yoo 've bin misinformd. Oberlin respex the laws, and hez now a body uv her galyent sons in the feeld a fightin to manetane the Constooshn.” “A fightin to manetane the Constooshn,” retortid I. “My frend,” (and I spoke impressivly,) “no Oberlin man is a doin any sich thing. Oberlin commenst this war. Oberlin wuz the prime cause uv all the trubble. What wuz the beginnin uv it? Our Suthrin brethrin wantid the territories—Oberlin objectid. They wantid Kansas fer ther blessid instooshn—Oberlin agin objecks. They sent colonies with muskits and sich, to hold the terrytory—Oberlin sent 2 thowsand armed with Bibles and Sharp's rifles—two instooshns Dimokrasy cood never stand afore—and druv em out. They wantid Breckinridge fer President. Oberlin refused, and elektid Linkin. Then they seceded; and why is it that they still hold out?” He made no anser. “Becoz,” continyood I, transfixin him with my penetratin gaze, “Oberlin won't submit. We might 2-day hev peese ef Oberlin wood say to Linkin, `Resine!' and to Geff Davis, `Come up higher!' When I say Oberlin, understand it ez figgerative fer the entire Ablishn party, uv wich Oberlin is the fountin-hed. There's wher the trubble is. Our Suthern brethren wuz reasonable. So long ez the Dimokrasy controld things, and they got all they wanted, they wur peeceable. Oberlin ariz—the Dimokrasy wuz beet down, and they riz up agin it.” Jest eggsactly 80-six yeres ago, akordin to Jayneses Almanac, a work wich I perooz annually with grate delite, the Amerykin eagle, (whose portrate any wun who possessis a 5-cent peece kin behold,) wuz born, the Goddis uv Liberty bein its muther, the Spirit uv Freedom its sire, Tomas Gefferson actin ez physician on the occasion. The proud bird growd ez tho it slept on guano—its left wing dipt into the Pasific, its rite into the Atlantic, its beek thretened Kanady, while his majestik tale cast a shadder ore the Gulf. Sich wuz the eagle up to March, '61. What is his condishn now? His hed hangs, his tale droops, ther 's no strength in his talons. Wat 's the trubble? Oberlin. He hed been fed on nigger fer yeres, and hed thrived on the diet. Oberlin got the keepin uv him — she withholds his nateral food; and onless Oberlin is whaled this fall, down goes the eagle.

In makin this anounsement, I feel it due my Dimekratik brethrin that I stait the resens for takin this step. They run ez follows: 1st. I want an offis. 2d. I need a offis. 3d. A offis wood suit me; ther4, 4th. I shood like to hev a offis. I maik no boasts uv what my speshel clames air, but I hev dun the party sum servis. My fust vote I cast for that he old Dimekrat, Androo Jaxn. For him I voted twict, and I hev also voted for every Dimekratik candidate sence. I hev fought and bled for the coz, hev voted ez offen ez 3 times at 1 elekshin, and hev alluz wore mournin around my ize for 3 weeks after eech eleckshin. I hev alluz rallid 2 the poles erly in the mornin, and hev spent the entire day a bringin in the ajid and infirm, and in the patryotik biznis uv knockin down the opposition voters. No man hez drunk more whisky than I hev for the party—none hez dun it moar willingly. Twict, in goin thro campanes, hev I brot myself 2 the very verge uv delirium tremins, a drinkin the terrific elekshun whisky pervided by our candidates, but the coz demandid the sacrifis, and I made it ez cherefully ez tho my stumic hed been copper-lined, wich, unfortunitly, it is not. Ez for my servises in this line, let my nose, wich hez trooly blossumd like the lobster, speek for itself. “Rum hez its triumphs ez the water hath, And this is wun uv them.” [Cotashun from a pome.] My politikle prinsipples are sound. I am opposd 2 a nashnel bank, and am unmitigatedly in favor uv free trade. I approved uv the last war with Grate Britten, and hev sence seen no reason 2 change my views on that subgik. On the war queshun my vews are ez follose: Bein a naytiv uv this Republic, and hevin livd under the Stars and Strypes, I am in favor uv manetanin the Guverment, and puttin down the rebelyun, and will ade the Guverment in doin it, in all constitooshnal ways. But, after a keerful readin uv my papers, I kin find no constitooshnal warrant for half what is bein dun. I am in favor uv a war for the Union ez it uzd to was, and the Constitooshn ez I 'd like to hev it; but a war uv subgugashen—never! Hents, I am opposed to all this military biznis. Ef a cittyzen uv Virginny shoots a cittyzen uv Ohio, let him be arrested, taken before the nearest Gustis uv the Peese, and bound over to court. That 's the only way 2 do it. I regard confistikashen as unconstitooshnel, and ez for emansipashen, words cant express my disgust at the bare ijee. Wat! is armis 2 march 4th, under the good old flag, for the purpus uv destroyin an institooshn guaranteed by the Constitooshn, and wich hez enabled the grate Dimekratik party to controle the destinies uv this republic for morn thirty yeres? Ferbid it, hevin! The follerin resolushens, wich I drawd up, show percisely wat I bleeve: Resolved, That we are now, eggsackly as we alluz hev bin, the devoted friends uv the Union ez it used to be wen us uns, and our breethrin uv the Sowth, run the masheen, and we 'd be thundrin glad 2 see it restord agin. Resolved, That evry dictate uv patertism reqwires that, in the tuff fight we hev afore us, the good old Dimokrasy shood present a unbroken front; and therefore, ez differenses may arize amongst us, the General Committee shel, frum time to time, inform the county committis wat the peple is expectid 2 beleve, that we may talk alike in all parts uv the country. Resolved, That the Abolishn party, by ther denunsiashun uv President Davis, hev shown that they hev no regard for our feelins or hizn, and hev exhibited a bitterness toward our misgided Suthrin brethrin, that demonstraits their onfitness to hold eny plais wer they kin hev an opportunity to ingure them. Resolved, That the stait uv Massychusits is ornery and cussed. That the annymossity exibited by her men, in the lait fites afore Richmond, towards our misgided Suthrin brethrin, is wat mite be expektid frum a stait that hez no Dimekrats, and wher evry boddy redes and rites. Resolved, That, while rebels shood be punnisht, we are opposed to confisticashun er emansipashun in eny shaip; becoz: 1stly. Taint constooshnal. 2dly. They'd be made more despriter, and moar uv em wood be killd, wich wood lessen Dimekratik magoritis in them staits. 3dst. It wood hev a tendency 2 make em madder nor they air. On the absorbin question uv nigger I am sound. I am opposed to amalgamashun, and am in favor uv prohibittin any wench frum marryin any wun hevin a vizable admixter uv white blud. I am ferninst allowin niggers to kum into the North, and am in favor uv expellin the thirty-2 milyuns now hear. To force em away, I wood maik it a pennytenshiary offence 2 be shavd by a nigger, and wood regulate the price uv barberin by law, that white men mite be indoost to go into the biznis. Ez for other pints uv nashenel and stait policy, my paper dident cum last nite, and consequently I am somewhat at a loss. In county matters I shel follow closely the footsteps uv my predecessers. I shel be keerful uv the funds, and shel apply jest ez much ez possible to the grate work uv bildin up the Dimekratik party; alluz, uv coarse, reservin enuff to buy me a modrit farm at the close uv my term. Wun thing I pledj myself 2 do ef I am elektid. The persekooshun uv that eminent finanseer, our defaultin Trezerer, shel be stopt. Sech a trifle ez ?2,800 is not enuff to disturb the peese uv the county. We shood compermise with him—let him keep the munny, and let the people keep— still. Then things will go smooth. I aint pertickeler ez to wat offis I hev. I am willin to serve ez Trezerer, Sheriff, Commishener, er Coryner—tho I cood do the party more good ez Trezerer than in any other posishen. Munny cozes the femail hoss to percede. In konklushen, fellow Dimekrats, I hev 2 say, ef nominated, all rite; ef not, I shel abide by the result ez cherefully ez my temper will allow. Respectively, Petroleum V. Nasby.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">IX. SHOWS WHY HE SHOULD NOT BE DRAFTED. August the 6th, 1862. I see in the papers last nite that the Goverment hez institooted a draft, and that in a few weeks sum hunderds uv thousands uv peeceable citizens will be dragged to the tented feeld. I know not wat uthers may do, but ez for me, I cant go. Upon a rigid eggsaminashen uv my fizzlekle man, I find it wood be wus ner madnis for me 2 undertake a campane, to-wit: 1. I 'm bald-headid, and hev bin obliged to ware a wig these 22 years. 2. I hev dandruff in wat scanty hair still hangs around my venerable temples. 3. I hev a kronic katarr. 4. I hev lost, sence Stanton's order to draft, the use uv wun eye entirely, and hev kronic inflammashen in the other. 5. My teeth is all unsound, my palit aint eggsactly rite, and I hev hed bronkeetis 31 yeres last Joon. At present I hev a koff, the paroxisms uv wich is friteful 2 behold. 6. I 'm holler-chestid, am short-winded, and hev alluz hed panes in my back and side. 7. I am afflictid with kronic diarrear and kostivniss. The money I hev paid for Jayneses karminnytiv balsam and pills wood astonish almost enny body. 8. I am rupcherd in 9 places, and am entirely enveloped with trusses. 9. I hev verrykose vanes, hev a white-swellin on wun leg and a fever sore on the uther; also wun leg is shorter than tother, though I handle it so expert that noboddy never noticed it. 10. I hev korns and bunyons on both feet, wich wood prevent me from marchin. I dont suppose that my political opinions, wich are ferninst the prossekooshn uv this unconstooshnel war, wood hev any wate with a draftin orfiser; but the above reesons why I cant go, will, I maik no doubt, be suffishent.

      <field name="fulltext">X. IN CANADA. Brest, Kanada West, August the 20th, 1862. After more advenchers than wood fill a book, I am here in Kanada, safe under the protectin tail uv the British Lion, where no draftin orfiser kin molest nor make me afraid. Halleloogy! I never shood hev taken this step—or, ruther, the succeshun uv steps that brot me here—hed a good, sound, constooshnel doctor bin appinted Medical Eggsaminer; fer I hev twict ez menny diseases ez wood hev eggsemptid me, but I wuz afeerd the Eggsaminer woodent see em, ez he aint much uv a physician anyhow; besides, he votes the Union tickit, and hez, uv coarse, prejudisis. The Commissioner is a bluddy Ablishnist; and, besides, I owe him a store bill wich hez stood about 8 years. I protest agin all sich appintments. I left, in company with 5 other invalids, wun nite, a little after the “witchin hour uv 12 M.,” ez Shakspeer hez it, and any wun beholdin our faces wood hev bin satisfide that sum “church-yard yawned” jest previously. We traveld all nite, “sustaned and soothed by an unfaltrin trust” in a bottle wich I, with my usual 4site, took along, together with 2 and 1-third yards uv bolony sassige, wich I alluz use ez a thirst-provoker. We met no interrupshen till we got within 5 miles uv Toledo, (wich we did by 5 P. M. uv the next day—wich, permit me to remark, wus good travelin fer sich debillytatid cusses,) when we wuz stopt by a pickit-gard uv the “Anti-draftin Invalid League,” who remarkt: “Who goes there?” “A invalid,” sez I. “A Peece invalid?” sez he. “Ther aint no other kind,” sez I; whereupon, sez he, “Yoor a man uv sence;” a fact uv wich I hed been long aware. I presentid my liqwid consiliater, when he informd me that Toledo wuz closely watcht, that escape by steemer was impossible, and that a small bote was our only chance. He took us to the lake shore, furnisht us a bote, and, jest as the golden sun wuz a sinkin behind the golden horizon, I bid my nativ land adoo. I need not dwell upon the perils uv that terrible passage. Suffice it 2 say, that, fer invalids, we rowed well, and finally landed at the little village uv Brest, wher we now air. 200 Peece men are here, and I must acknowledge that we are not treeted with that distinguished consideration usually accordid political eggsiles. Fer instance, at the tavern where I board, the parler is partikelerly plesent, and I wuz a settin into it. In trips a girl, purty enuff fer a man whose taste wuz not vishiated 2 eat. “Shel I shet down this window, sir?” sez she. “Why shet it down, gentle maid?” retorts I, lookin sweet onto her. “Because,” replide she, “I thot, perhaps, the DRAFT was too much fer ye.” A few slavish Kanajens, who set there, laft. The landlord required a month's pay in advance, and a further deposit uv 25 cents per eggsile, as sekoority fer the pewter spoons wich we hev at table. To cap the climacks, last nite a big nigger was put into eech uv our rooms, and we were forced to sleep with em, or okkepy the floor, wich I did. The cussid nigger laft all nite, in a manner trooly aggravatin to hear. Petroleum V. Nasby. P. S.—Tell my wife to send sich money as she earns, to me, as livin is high, and ther aint no tick.

      <field name="fulltext">4 XI. IS FINALLY DRAFTED. Camp uv the 778th Ohio Kidnapt Melishy, Toledo, October the 17th, 1862. I am here, clad in the garb uv slaivry! Nasby, clothed in a bobtailed bloo coat, a woolin shirt, and bloo pants, with a Oysteran muskit in his hands, a goin thro the exercise! Good hevings! wat a spectacle! The draft was over, and I thot that wunst more I 'd visit my native land. Gaily I stept abord the bote that was to carry me from British shores— gaily I say, fer my money hed given out some weeks afore, and I hed earned a precarious subsistence a sawin wood in pardnership with a disgustin mulatto, and I lookt forward with joyful antisepashens to the time when I shood agen embrace Looizer Jane, (the pardner of my buzzum,) and keep my skin perpetooally full uv the elickser uv life, out uv her washin money. Joyfully I sprang off the bote onto the wharf at Toledo, when a hevy hand was laid onto my shoulder. Twas a soljer! The follerin conversashen ensood: “Wat wantest thow, my gentle friend?” “I want yoo, my gay Kanajen.” “On wat grounds?” retortid I. “On the ground uv eloodin uv the draft,” sez he. “Yoor mistaken,” sez I; “I 'm a Ablishnist— a emissary. I hev bin a spredin the bred uv life among the poor kulerd brethrin in Kanady, and am jest returnin to run thro another lot. Let me pass, I entreat thee, nor stay me in my good work.” (This wuz strategy.) “Not much,” sez he. “I know better. Yoor a butternut.” “How knowst thou?” sez I. “Yoor nose,” sez he. “That bucheus beekun lite wuz never got out uv spring water.” “Yoor knowledge uv men and things is too much fer me. I confess, and surrender at discreshun—do with me ez thou wilt.” And he did. I wuz led out to camp, and wuz allowd to volunteer to fite against my convickshens—against my brethren, who hev taken up arms in a rightous coz. So be it. Hentz4th the naim uv Nasby will shine in the list uv marters. Amid the dark, deep gloom that envellups me, wun ray uv light strikes me. I have seen the eleckshun returns, and wen I seed em I yelled Hallelogy! Me and another victim uv Linkin's tyranny, who is a Dimekrat, (he wuz a postmaster under Bookannon, and wen removed by Linkin dident give up the balance uv money he had on hand, fearin twood be used to subvert our free instooshns,) hed a jubilee. We smuggled a bottle uv condenst ekstasy, and celebratid muchly. “The North 's redeemed!” showtid I. “Let the eagle screme!” yelled he. “The Quakers hev votid!” showtid I. “Ablishnism dead!” screemed he. “Dimokrasy 's triumphed!” laft I; and so on, until after midnite, when, completely eggsaustid, we sank into slumber, with a empty bottle atween us. Petroleum V. Nasby. P. S.—Tell Looizer Jane that I may never see her again—that shood it be my fate 2 perish on the battle-feeld, amid the rore uv battle and the horrors uv missellaneous carnage, my last thot, ez life ebbs slowly away, shall be uv her; and ask her if she can't send me half or three-quarters uv the money she gits fer washin, ez whisky costs fritefully here.

      <field name="fulltext">XII. DESERTS—HIS EXPERIENCE IN CLOTHES. Camp uv the Looisiana Pelicans, Nov. the 1st, 1862. I hev deserted, and am now a soljer uv the Confederacy. Jest ez soon ez our regiment struck Suthrin sile, I made up my mind that my bond-age wuz drawin to a close—that I wood seeze the fust oppertoonity uv escapin to my nateral frends, the soljers uv the sunny South. Nite before last I run the gard, wuz shot at twice, (reseevin two buck-shot jest below the hind buttons uv my coat,) but by eggstrordinary luck I escaped. Had infantry bin sent after me I shood hev bin taken, for I am not a fast runner; but the commandent uv the post wuz new at the biznis, and innosently sent cavalry. Between the hossis they rode, and the stoppin to pick up them ez coodent stick onto ther flyin steeds, I hed no difficulty in outrunnin em. At last I encounterd the pickits uv the Looisiana Pelicans, and givin myself up ez a deserter from the hordes uv the tyrant Linkin, wuz to wunst taken afore the kernel. I must say, in this conneckshun, that I wuz surprised at the style uv uniform worn by the Pelicans. It consists uv a hole in the seet uv the pants, with the tale uv the shirt a wavin gracefully thereform. The follerin colloquy ensood: “To what regiment did yoo belong?” “776th Ohio.” “Volunteer or draftid?” “Draftid.” “Yoor name?” “Nasby, Petroleum V.” I notist all this time the kernel wuz eyein my clothes wistfully. I had jest drawd em, and they wuz bran-new. Sez the kernel: “Mr. Nasby, I reseeve you gladly ez a recroot in the Grand Army uv Freedom. Ez yoo divest yoorself uv the clothes uv the tyrant, divest yerself uv watever lingrin affecshuns yoo may hev fer the land uv yer nativity, and ez yoo array yerself in the garb uv a Suthrin soljer, try to fill yer sole with that Suthrin feelin that anymates us all. Jones,” sed he, addressin his orderly, “is Thompson dead yit?” “Not quite,” sez the orderly. “Never mind,” sez the kernel, “he cant git well uv that fever; strip off his uniform and give it to Nasby, and berry him.” I judgd, frum the style uv the uniforms I saw on the men around me, that I wood rather keep my own, but I sed nothin. When the orderly returned with the deceest Thompson's uniform, I groaned innardly. There wuz a pair uv pants with the seat entirely torn away, and wun leg gone below the knee, a shoe with the sole off, and the straw he had wrapped around the other foot, and a gray woolen shirt. Sez the kernel: “Do n't be afeerd uv me, Nasby. Put on yer uniform rite here.” Reluctantly, I pulled off my new dubble-soled boots, and I wuz petrified to see the kernel kick off the slippers he wore, and pull em on. I pulld off my pants—he put em on, and so on with every article uv dress I possest, even to my warm overkote and blankit. Sez the kernel: “These articles, Nasby, belongs to the Guvment, to which I shel akount fer them. Report yoorself to wunst to Captain Smith.” Ez I passed out, the lootenant-kernel, majer, and ajitent pulled me to wun side, and askt me “ef I coodent git three more to desert.” Wun glance at their habillyments showd why they wuz so anxious fer deserters. I candidly confess that Linkin takes better care uv his soljers than Davis does. The clothin I hev described.

      <field name="fulltext">XIII. CAPTURES A TURKEY. Camp uv the Looisiana Pelicans, } November the 15th, 1862. Nasby still lives, tho I must say its rayther tite nippin. The servis uv the Suthrin Confedracy wood be ez pleasant ez any military life cood be, were it not for three things, to-wit: 1. We hev nothin to eat. 2. Our clothes is designed more for ornament than use, consistin cheefly uv holes with rags around em—an appropriate summer costoom, but rayther airy for this season. 3. Our pay is irreglar, and not jest ez good in quality ez cood be wished. Fer instance. Our regiment hazzent reseevd a cent fer 8 months, and ther wuz much grumblin, wich cum to the ears uv the kernel. “The men murmur, do they?” sed he to his ajitent. “Their complaints is just, and they shel be paid their just dooze. Is ther a printin offis in the town?” “Ther is,” retorts the ajitent. “Go take possession uv it in the name uv the Confedrit States, and seeze whatever paper he may hev on hand. The faithful Pelicans must be paid.” The next day every wun uv the men hed his haversack stufft with money, each wun takin ez much ez he judgd he cood use. It does very well, except that it gives the grocery-keepers much trouble, as they take it by weight—a ?1 bein wuth ez much ez a ?20, ceptin that the ?20 is a trifle the largest, and weighs more. A incident. I wuz out on pikkit dooty, in the immejit visinnity uv a planter's barn, who hed bin suspectid uv Unionism. I saw a turkey, capchered it, and indulged all the way into camp into the pleasant idee that, fer the fust time in 2 months, I wood hev a stumic-distendin dinner. Ez I entered camp I met the kernel, who, ez his eagle eye caught the proud bird I held, spoke, sayin: “Ha! a turkey! Wher gottist thow him?” “I capcherd him at Johnson's,” replied I. “Fat and young,” mused he, feelin uv him; and then, lookin up, thus he did say: “My venerable patriot, (he allooded to my gray hairs,) this bird belonged to a Union man, and all sich property taken by the army belongs, uv coarse, 2 the goverment. Yoo will 4thwith take it to my quarters.” Not hevin eaten any thing for 18 hours, I determined to make wun effort for my turkey. Sez I: “Admittin the bird belongs to the goverment,” sez I, “I may retane him, I suppose, by payin his valyoo,” and I tendered him a handful uv the money we hed reseevd that mornin. “Not so fast, my aged hero,” sed he. “The goverment needs turkeys more than it does money. Money we kin make, but yoo must be aware that, without a material alterashen in our anatomikle structure, the makin uv a turkey by us is a impossibility. Leave the property at my quarters.” * * * * * That nite I passed the kernel's quarters. Ther wuz a sound uv revelry within, and the odor uv a Thanksgivin dinner assaild my nostrils. The next mornin I saw the kernel's dorg a chawin the bones uv that goverment turkey. Petroleum V. Nasby.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">XIV. IMPROVES HIS FORTUNES BY MARRIAGE. Camp uv the Looisiana Pelicans, } November the 11th, 1862. I am here, and mizrable! I am not less than 213 per cent. more mizrable nor I used to be! I consoomd 2 hours uv the Sutherin Confedracy's time, and a 12-foot board, assertainin the eggsact increese uv misery wich I am engoyin, with the above result. Wen I wuz draftid I wuz not particularly dissatisfied. My posishen wuz becomin precarious. Looizer Jane (the wife uv my buzum) had cut off my supplies, and wuz a wasting the money she reseevd fer washin on bread and clothes fer the childern, and misunderstandins and coolnisses ensood. I whaled her in the afternoon, when she wuz tired, and she whaled me in the mornin, when she wuz fresh. Had I expendid the energy and strength consoomd in whalin Looizer Jane in choppin cord-word, I mite hev ownd a farm. I then tried the credit system, but the unanimity with wich the barkeepers all remarkt that “that thing wuz played out,” wuz trooly surprisin to the undersined. Knowin that I cood at eny time desert to my Suthern frends, I felt satisfied at bein draftid. Sence my enrollment in the ranks uv the Pelicans, the romance uv the thing hez departid. Nothin 2 eat, nothin to wear, no money, and hard work. This is our fix. The plump, rosy Nasby is no more—anserin 2 his name is a lean indiviggooal, upon whose nose a bullet cood be split. I determined to better myself by marriage. The idee wuz sejestid by our second corpral, who interdoost me 2 a widder lady who lived jest out uv town—the owner uv 2 thousand akers. The akers inspired me, and I prest my soot with vigger and arder. In a week the thing wuz dun. I caught the regimental chaplin sober enuff wun nite, and we wuz married. Fer a day I wuz a happy man. I contemplatid MY plantashen, and wept teers uv goy. Suddenly my happiness bustid. The sargent informed me that my wife—the future sharer uv my goys and sorrers—wuz a OCTOROON, one-8th NIGGER!—that she wuz a slave left in charge by her mistress, and that the corpral did it jest fer a goak! A purty goak to play upon a Dimekrat! Nasby marryin a nigger! My views hev changed on the slavery question. Amalgamashen is the cuss uv slavery. The blacks hev bleached and bleached, until it is almost impossible to distinguish the slave from his owner. Wen the mix becomes wuss, wat then? Wen the slave is ez white ez his master, wat are yoo goin to do? Slavery, like a man with a tape-worm, hez within itself the elements necessary to its destruction. Amalgamashen is the tape-worm uv slavery. Petroleum V. Nasby.</field>

I hed a conversashen tother day with a fellow-defender uv the rites uv the South, wich ruther startled me. I wuz a holdin 4th, with my yoosual ability, on the blessidnis uv slavery, and wuz, uv coarse, quotin hevy frum skripter to defend my position. A member uv our company interruptid me by remarkin that nacher hed spiled a great rascal in me by not contribbitin a suffishent amount uv brains. He continued his remarks: “Nasby,” says he, “I know slavry is a cuss— a onmittygatid cuss. I hed 18 niggers, and they kept me as poor as a skim-milk cheese. The hogs eat the corn, the niggers eat the hogs, and I lived on what they left. To defend my property in these niggers, we seceshed and startid a new guvment. The new guvment took the corn, the hogs, the niggers, and finally took me. My oldest dawter run off with wun defender uv the flag, my wife with another, and my youngest children is livin with sum niggers 2 old fer the guverment to take. I 've had my share uv rites, I hev. Ef there 's any more comin to me, give em to some poor person as needs em. I 'm jest more 'n rollin in a perfooshn uv that kind uv wealth.” “But,” sez I — “Ther aint no buts,” sez he. “Yoo 're a Northern man, and do n't hev niggers. Do n't defend nigger. Ef I hev the itch, I may sware that itch is a good thing; but wat sense is ther in yoor swarin it, onasked and fer nothin. Sech stratejy borders closely on lunacy. Let us squeeze our own biles—do n't yoo do it gratooitous. Appolygize fer your own sins—do n't shoulder ourn. I may be mean for my own profit, but to act dirty fer another man's use, and hev him kick ye for doin it, is a lick ahead uv my comprehenshun. Durn all sech men.” And he stawkt indignantly away. I hev reseevd more letters from frends in my wunst happy but now distractid home than I kin anser separately. I shel do it all to wunst, thus: John M.—Shoemakin wood be a splendid biznis here, only ther aint no leather. Practice haffsolin with straw before yoo start. W. G.—The pay uv a member uv the Mississippi Legislater is ?6 per diem, evry day, paid in Confedrit 30 per cent. bonds, redeemable at the pleasure uv the guverment any time within two centuries. Come along. Almost any body kin git offis in this state. P. N.—Ther is a good openin fer a watchmaker here. I am the only mechanic in this section uv Mississippy. I fixt the kernel's watch yisterday; forged a mane-spring out uv a baynet, and for a chane used a fiddle-string. It do n't jest keep time, but, ez it ticks, it ansers to bet on poker. Fetch sum lard ile; tar won't work on watches, even in this warm climate. Amos.—The success uv our guverment is shoor. Finances hez trubbled us, but our Sekretary uv the Treasury hez bought 2 fast printin-presses, and a lot uv paper on tick, and we now git all we want. Petroleum V. Nasby.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">5 XVI. AT HOME. Wingert's Corners, February the 27th, 1863. A man who duz things frum principple kin stand a good deal. I kin. Sustaned and soothed by an unfaltrin trust in the rychusnis uv the Suthrin coz, I stuck to my beluvd rejyment, the Loozeaner Pelikins, with a tenassity wich I did not dreme I possest. But ther is a pint beyond wich human nacher can not go. I endoord hunger and cold—I saw the rags drop off my muskeler limbs, wun by wun—I murmered not. But, wen the pantaloons wuz awl gone, wen my costoom wuz a blanket and wun shoe, I applide fer new pants, and the quarter-master onfeelinly remarkt that my dress wuz all rite—that hereafter my costoom wuz to be adoptid ez the uniform uv the rejyment—I felt that desershun wuz no longer a crime, and I deserted. It is entirely onnessary to rekount awl I endoored in makin my eskaip. Suffice it to say, that at Columbus I stript the klose off uv an innebryatid solger, and maid my way to Amandy Township. My old Dimekratik friends did not kno me, and ez I expected to borry money uv them, I deemed it best not to make myself known. They were suspishus uv my bloo kote at fust, until wun uv them remarkt how I likd the serviss? To wich I anserd, “Dam the serviss!” “Do n't admire fitin fer the nigger, eh?” “Not any,” sez I. “Why not desert?” sez he. “I hev deserted,” sez I. In a instant the aspeck uv things wuz changd. A jug wuz prodoost, and they awl shook hands. Wun, more richer nor the rest, handed me a treasury note uv ?10, sayin, “You may need it.” I replide that, as a general thing, I wood hev nothin to do with any paper that bore the babboon likeness uv the usurper and tyrent Linkin; but, under the sirkumstances, I wood endoor it until I cood get it changd into Injeany munny. They took up a kollekshun to wunst, fer my benefit, which amounted to ?43. Jest at this pint wun uv em asked me to what rejyment I belonged. I replide, “The Loozeaner Pelikins.” “Loozeaner!” sed another, “why, that's a Confedracy rejyment, aint it?” “To be sure,” sez I. “And air yoo a deserter from a Suthrin rejyment?” sez the benevolent old butternut who hed invested ?10 in the deserter biznis. “Sartin,” sez I. Seezin me by the throte, he ejackelated, “Give me my money, you swindler!” And with a unanimity trooly surprisin, they awl yelled, “Give me my money, you swindler—you got it under false pretences.” Hevin the munny safe in my pokkit, I took these compliments with ekanimity, sidlin out and gettin away ez soon ez possible. I am disappointed in Amandy. Frum wat I hed heard, I hed supposed they were kind to deserters. I found that it makes much differense wich side you desert from. Petroleum V. Nasby.</field>

Wunst more the tree uv liberty is uprooted in my person; wunst more hev the unrighteous tools uv the monster Linkin seized my venerable form and incarceratid it in a basteel. So many times hev I bin imprisoned fer opinion's sake, that, ef I kin get a pardner with capital, I shel go into the marterin biznis. But 2 my narrashen. When the news reechd me uv the bold stand made by the heroes uv Hoskinvill in opposition to the draft, I determined to throw myself “in2 the deadly and imminent breech,” ez W. Shakspeer hez it. I made my way to Hoskinville, wuz reseeved with the wildest enthoosiasm by the patriots ther assembled, and wuz to wunst placed in command uv the forces. It wuz a prowd day fer Nasby! Before me stood, leaned, and laid, (akordin ez they hed emptied their canteens, wich wuz all filled with new fitin whisky,) two hundred uv the brave sons uv Hoskinvill, from the rich, hory-headed farmer, (uv whom I promptly borrerd 80 odd dollars,) to the gay and sportive yooth uv 16, all consoomd with onquenchable arder. I drilled sech uv them ez were suffishently sober to keep their feet, nigh onto two days, amoozin ourselves, into the intervals, with passin resolooshens denouncin Linkin, and pledgin ourselves to resist even un2 death. At last our scouts brot us intelligence that two companies uv bloo-coated hirelins wuz within 9 miles uv us, approachin at the rate uv wun and a half miles per hour. “Ha!” shoutid I, “the foe! they comest! Now, men uv Hoskinville and visinnity, show yourselves men!” Accordinly another meetin was immejitly organizd, chairman and sekretary appointid, and a resolution passed, pledgin the meetin to resist even un2 death, the proseedins to be published in all the Dimekratik papers. We adjourned, and I wuz about drawin on em up in line uv battle, and wuz instructin uv em to hold the muzzle uv the gun from instid uv toward theirselves when they fired, and wuz explainin to others the nesessity uv puttin the powder down the barrel before the ball, and makin sech other arrangements ez a wise and prudent commander, determined to conker or die, would, when suthin like a dozen uv em ejakilates: “Gineral!” Drawin myself up to my full hite, I anserd, “Wat!” “Gineral,” sez wun uv the oldest, “we are not advantajesly postid. Wood it not be better on the hill,” sed he, pintin to a high eminence jest east uv the town. I perseeved at a glance the strategik importance uv the position, as the enemy wuz approachin from the west, and I ordered the men to deploy by squadrons, in open right file platoons, and okepy the summit. Never wuz a order obeyed with greater alacrity. I hev a reputashen fer speed—I kin rival the courser and outstrip the jentle gazelle, but they shot past me like a arrow. Their enthoosiasm carried em to the top uv the hill, and how much further I hev no menes uv knowin, ez when I reached the top uv the hill not wun uv the resisters wuz in site. I wuz arrested that nite. In vain I protested that I wuz a Methodist preacher sellin fruit-trees, My nose, wich blossoms ez the lobster, and a copy of the Noo York Day-Book I hed in my pocket, wuz aginst me, and I wuz to wunst confined. My feelins is hurt. Petroleum V. Nasby.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">XVIII. STRATEGISES. Wingert's Corners, May the 15th, 1863. Dimokrasy hezn't ez many hobbies now ez it used to hev, and it is somewhat difficult to keep the people strung up the proper pitch. Nigger is all the capital we hev left, and its rayther tough work to keep the old machine runnin. In Union and Orange their blood dident bile when I told em that 40,000 niggers wuz on their way to that section—nary bile. So I hed recourse to strategy. Last Friday nite I prokoored some lamp-black and lard-ile, and applyin it to my classic countenance, and my laber-staned hands, transformd myself into a villainous contraband. Then I proceeded after night to the south end uv the township, and at daylight commenst goin north. The skeem workt beautiful. At every house the follerin conversashen wood ensoo: “Hello, Cuff, wher you from?” “Tennisee, massa.” “Wher you goin?” “I'se gwine to stop sum 'ers 'bout heah.” “Who sent you North?” “Kurnel Niblin, and de Ablishners ob de 21st.” “Dam Niblin, and yoo too. Git!” Wich I alluz did. Then goin back I'd take another road, stealin sich trifles ez shirts and stockins, and usin sich other means uv arousin our people 2 a realizin sense uv the cuss uv a floatin nigger populashen ez sejested themselves to my mind. It became a serious thing though, for on the fourth day so many hed seen me, that they reely sposd the nigger invashen had commenst, and they hunted me. I run a mile, and findin they were gainin on me, darted into the woods, washed, and come out ez the original Nasby. Lord! what an enthoosiastic meetin we had that night. Their faith in the nigger invasion hed bin shaky, but it was now firm. They had seen em. Wun had seen 38 that day, uv wich number he wuz proud to say he had killed 5. I larfed innardly, but held my peece. Desepshen is justifiable now and then. I kin do it. I only borrered ?4 in Union. Petroleum V. Nasby.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">XIX. ADDRESSES THE SOLDIERS. At a meetin uv the manejers uv the ginoowine Dimokrasy, consistin uv the illustrious Vallandigum and myself, it was resolved to ishoo a address to the soljers uv the Cumberland. Vallandigum, hevin failed in the habus corpus biznis, is employin his spare time in amusin of hisself in Fort Warin, wich is near Boston. The dooty, there4, devolves upon me. Soljers: Ez individooels hevin votes, I esteem you; ez invaders of Dimekratik states, ez men engaged in the slawtrin uv Dimekrats by the 1000, ez bloo-koted tools uv a Abolishn despotism, I can not smile on you approvinly. Sum uv you wuz Dimekrats, who, without contemplatin the konsekences to the party, volunteerd. Faytle errer! incomprehensible stoopidity! And I regret 2 lern that, notwithstandin we hev told you over and over that it is a Abolishn war, you laff at our sollum warnins, and menny uv you hev turnd Abolishnists yureselves. We warned yoo uv the evils that wood naterally foller Abolishn victoris. To show you that we proffeside correctly, I call yure attenshun to the follerin strictly Dimekratik fact. Since the commensement uv the war the addishn uv niggers to Northern Ohio hez bin ez folloze: Hankok, 28,000 Wood, 84,000 Lorane, (wich is near Oberlin,) 103,000 [All uv wich is studyin fer the ministry, drawin cavelry captin's pay and rashens, till they gradoo8, inclooding 2 white servants, each.] Sineky, 93,000 And so on, ad infinytum. These niggers are workin in sitooashens you wunst okepied. The tailor shops, blacksmith shops, shoe shops, and stores is all filld with these noosencis, fresh from Suthrin plantashens. So yoo see that while they hev seezed upon yure labor, you air taxt by a nigger-luvin government to support them in idlenis. But there is moar fax: Number uv soljer's wives who died uv starvashen in Hankok County last week, 1,253 Besides 1 small wooman they did not count. And all this time (my blud biles wen I think uv it) the entire nigger popelashen is bein fed on briled sirline stake stufft with oysters. 238 white men hev marrid black femails, within 2 weeks, also 803 white wimmin to black men, all in the corporashen uv Wingert's Corners, the guverment payin license, preecher's fee, and the bridle outfit, incloodin furnytoor to start em howskeepin. It is useless to multiply instances. You are ecksposin yure lives and helth, just 2 set free a army uv shiftlis niggers, who wont work, and who, by takin yure plasis on the farms and in the workshops, will prevent you from earnin a honist livin wen yoo git back. Soljers, remember these things wen yoo vote this fall. Under Dimekratik rule, wen the Sowth roold us percisely as they wantid 2, awl wuz peese. We kin hev it agin on the saim terms, with perhaps the payin uv the expensis they have incurred in manetanin uv ther rites, payin penshuns 2 the widders uv them yoo hev wikkidly slane, et settery. Soljers! you kin emansipate yureselves. Shoot yure orfisers, throw down yure arms, and cum home. The old party is in danger, and without you it 'll go to rooin a canterin. Shel any feelin uv pride in yure country deter you frum comin wen yure party is in peril? I can not believe it. Petroleum V Nasby.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">XX. ORGANIZES A DEMOCRATIC CHURCH. Wingert's Corners, June the 6th, 1863. Nuthin hez dun so much agin the Dimokrasy ez churches, skool-houses, Sundy-skools, preachers, and sich. Here, our people hev awoken to the dangerous tendencies uv sich instooshns, and hev set about viggerously to suppress em. Ez this work is wat my hart delites in, I organized the pious portion uv the Dimokrasy, that we mite do our work well and thorough. When my jigantic intellek hez a chance, the work is shoor to be well done, and I hev the satisfaction uv announcin the complete destruction uv two churches, the drivin off uv 5 preachers, and the frightnin uv many wimin. But my mission is not alone to tear down—I bild up. The ijee segestid itself to my fertile mind, that a strikly Dimekratik Church and Sundy-skool wood not only help the cause, but afford me an easy livin. It wuz dun, and I am reglarly installed ez the paster uv the First Dimekratik Church uv Ohio. The follerin is the order uv exercises: 1. People assemble at the second tootin uv the horn. 2. Readin uv one uv the follerin passages uv Skripter: 9th chapter uv Jennysis, wich relates the cussin uv Canaan, provin that niggers is Skriptoorally slaves; and the chapters about Hayger and Onesimus, wich proves the Fugitive-slave Law to be skriptooral. (The rest uv the Bible we consider figgerative, and pay no attenshun to it watever.) 3. Singin—“O, we 'll hang Abe Linkin on a sour apple-tree,” or some other improvin ode, hevin a good moral. 4. Readin extrax from the Noo York Argus. 5. Singin—“O, John Brown's body hangs a danglin in the air.” 6. Reading from the Day-Book. 7. Lecture on watever phase uv the nigger question may seem appropriate. We hev also organized a Sundy-skool on a pure basis. I spent much time in gettin up a katekizm, uv wich the follerin is a sample: Q. Wat is the cheef end uv man? A. To whale niggers and vote the Dimekratik tikkit forever. Q. Wat do the Skripters teach? A. That a angel sent Hayger back to her mistress; that Paul sent Onesimus back; and “Servance obey yure masters.” Q. Who wuz Onesimus and Hayger? A. Onesimus wuz a mulatter, and Hayger a octoroon. Q. Wat is sin? A. Skratchin a ticket. Q. Who compose the Dimekratik trinity? A. Vallandigum, Brite, and Fernandywood. Q. Wat is the first duty uv man? A. To beware uv Ablishn lies; to rally to the poles; to vote early; and to bring in the agid, the infirm, and the ideotik. To stimoolate the infant mind I hev institootid a system uv rewards, ez follows: For commitin 2 verses uv Vallandigum's address, 1 beer check, good at the Corners; 5 verses, 2 checks; 12 verses, 4 checks; and to the child hevin the most verses, a copper-mounted butternut pin. We hed a festival yesterday. The tables wuz bounteously spred with bolony, liver-worst, and crackers, wile a barl uv native whisky furnisht the flooids nessary. It wuz a tetchin site to see the mothers, with maternal solissitood, a mixin nacher's great restorer with water and sorgum surup, to adapt it to the infantile stumick. Fer my part, I alluz take mine strait. I bleeve good will be accomplisht. Last week, in makin a pastoral visit, jest about noon, to the house uv wun uv my flock, who hez fine poultry, I wuz amoosed at hearin a meer infant, only three years uv old, swinging his little hat, and cry, “Hooraw for Jeff Davis.” It wuz tetchin. Pattin the little patriot on the head, I instantly borrowd five cents uv his father to present to him. Petroleum V. Nasby.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">XXI. GOES ON WITH HIS CHURCH. Church of St. Vallandigum, June the 10th, 1863. We hed a blessid and improvin time yisterday. My little flock staggered in at the usual hour in the mornin, every man in a heavenly frame uv mind, hevin bin ingaged all nite in a work uv mercy, to-wit: a mobbin uv 2 enrollin officers. One uv em resisted, and they smote him hip and thigh, even ez Bohash smote Jaheel. (Skriptooral, wich is nessary, bein in the ministry.) He wuz left for dead. We opened servis by singin a hym, wich I writ, commencin ez follows: “Shel niggers black this land possess, And mix with us up here? O no, my frends, we rayther guess We 'll never stand that 'ere. I then held forth from this text: “Whar hev ye laid him?” I statid that the person I referred to wuz the marterd Vallandigum, and I, in behaff uv a outraged Dimokrasy, demanded uv the tyrant Linkin, “Wher hev yoo laid him?” A unconvertid individooal sed, “He 's laid him out!” wich remark cost him a broken head. I went on to show why our saint hed bin martered. It wuz becoz he wuz a Dimekrat—becoz he dared to exercise the rites guaranteed to every American, exceptin Ablishnists and niggers, uv aboosin the guverment. Fer this, and nuthin else, wuz he eggsiled. “My frends,” sez I, drawin myself up to my full hite, and lookin as much like Fernandywood ez possible, “I am willin to be marterd. I denounce this war as unholy, unconstooshnel, unrighteous, and unmittygated. It is nuthin less than a invashen uv Dimekratik states, for the sole purpus uv freein niggers. Linkin is a tyrant, Burnside a tool, Order 38 a relik uv barberism, 6 and I will resist the enrollment, the conskripshen, and the tax. Hooray fer Geff Davis.” Our class-meetin wuz more interestiner than ever. One old, white-headed brother sed that at times his way was dark, and his pathway gloomy. Wunst he wuz very near becomin a infidle. He reely believed at one time that the nigger was human, and wunst he voted for a Republican road supervisor. But he hed repented, and was, he trusted, forgiven. His mind wuz now easy, and he should vote the whole Dimekratik tickit. Two backsliders, who scratched their tickits last fall, confest their sin, publicly. I exhorted em two hours, fined em a gallon uv whisky appeece, and took em into full communion. The whisky will be devotid to the missionary service, wich is me. This is a deliteful feeld uv labor. At the Corners they give me sech flooids ez I need at all the doggeries but one, and at that one they trust me, wich amounts to the same thing. I hev borrid uv my flock over 60 dollars already. It is a rich feeld, and wun wich will endoor much workin. My nose is deepnin in color every hour. Petroleum V. Nasby, Paster uv sed Church, in charge.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">XXII. “CAPCHERD.” In a Linkin Basteel, Columbus, June the 20th, 1863. Agen I am in durence vile. Agen I am in the hands uv Linkin's hirelin minyuns, and my Church is without a paster. The sheperd is smitten and the sheep may be scattered. Were it not for two barls uv whisky that we hed in the church, I dout wether the organnyzashen wood continner. My prayer is that the cohesive flooid may hold out till I return. My capcher wuz ez follose: Wen the Dimekrats, the peece men of Homes County, declared war, I threw off the sacerdotle robes and tuk up the sword. Arrivin at Millersberg, I jined the peece forces to onct. Ability is alluz recognizd, and I wuz immejitly made commander-in-cheef uv the forsis. A full uniform uv butiful butternut cloth, and a copperheded sword wuz presented me. I immejitly commenst drillin the men, and in 2 days hed them perfishent in compny and battalyun drill. We fortyfide, buildin gabeyuns, faseens, and eliptiks, and neglectid no precaushen to make victry sure. Fifteen hundred strong, we pledgd ourselves to hist the black flag, and never surrender. Finally the enemy hove in site. Ez they cum up, our men trembled with anxiety to meet em. Sum too hunderd askt permishen to withdraw frum the fortyfications, make a detoor over the hill, and flank em, wich request, bein unwillin to restrane their arder, I ackseded to. Sum 500 jined em, and I spoze are detoorin yit, ez I hev never seen em since. This movement wuz fatle, ez all went who were sober enuff 2 walk. Jest afterwards cum the catastrofy. Ten uv the very men who hed bin foremost in advisin resistence, cum up with the Fedrals, and advised a surrender! Hopin to gane time, I askt too hours to consider. Unfortnit errer! Before the too hours wuz up, haff the men wuz sober, and, instid uv histin the black flag, they capitoolatid, delivrin up the ringleeders. I wuz taken ez a hed ringleeder, and wuz ironed and taken to Columbus, wher I now am. In hopes uv keepin my flock 2gether, I writ em a epistle, as follows: To the Fatheful at Wingert's Corners, greetin: I rite you in bonds. I beseech you, deerly beluved, to be stedfast in yure faith, holdin on to sech truth ez I left you. Be viggelent in good works, patient in chasin enrollin offisers, and quick in tarrin and feathrin on em. For tho, I am not with you, the tar-barl and what's left uv the feathers is in my study, jest behint the whisky barls. Be temprit. Ten er 20 nips per day is enuff fer eny man in helth; if weakly, the number may be indefinitly increest. I am alluz in bad helth. Bewair uv false teechers. Let no Triboons pizen yer minds—stick close to the Crysis. Keep up yure Sundy exercises; ef yoo hev wun among you that kin rede, let him next Sundy eddify yoo with Pooh's speech. Neglect not the Sundy-skool. That proper interest may be kept up in the minds uv the children, I wood sejest that Sundy afternoons you ketch a preecher and hev the darlins rotten-egg him. “Jest ez the twig is bent,” et settry. Be ennerjetik in tearin down meetin-houses, fer they are injoorin us. In conclooshen, deerly beluved, remember me. Send me a eucher deck, a too-gallon jug uv corn joose; also, the weekly collekshun.

      <field name="fulltext">XXIII. STARTS A PAPER. Church uv St. Vallandigum, June the 30th, 1863. I am back in the midst uv my flock. I coodent be a marter. The Fedral orfisers dismist me with the insultin remark that I wuz 2 smal pertaters to notis. Hevin time on my hands, and feelin that I 'm livin in vane onless I am doin suthin for the grate coz, I hev determined to ishoo a paper, devoted to disseminatin my vews. I ishood my prospectusses to-day, uv which the follerin is wun: TO THE PURE DIMOKRASY! Prospectus uv the “Marter and Tirent Resister!” Orgust 1st, the undersined will ishoo the fust number uv a paper bearin the above title, devoted to the interests uv the pure Dimokrasy. To inshoor the fatheful just sech a paper ez they need, the follerin able writers hev bin ingayjed, regardless uv expence: On arbitrary arrests—Petroleum V. Nasby. On habis corpuss—P. V. Nasby. On nigger—P. Volcano Nasby. On vilashens uv Constooshnal rites—Mr. Nasby. This brilyunt gallacksy uv intelleck, under the edytoral control uv Petroleum V. Nasby. The “Marter and Tirent Resister” will support Vallandigum, and while givin the guvernment a harty support in puttin down the rebelyun, will uv coarse oppose— Coercin the secedid staits; Invadin the secedid staits; Raisin armies by volunteerin; Raisin armies by draft er conscripshen; Raisin meens by tax or tariff; Arrestin uv men for sympathisin with the Southern Dimokrasy; Arrestin uv eny body for any thing; The usin uv niggers ez soljers; The usin uv white men ez soljers; Every thing the Administrashen hez dun, is doin, er may hereafter do. It will viggerously advokate— The Constitooshn ez it is; Doin away uv the Constitooshn; The Union ez it wuz; The plan for dividin the Union in2 4 parts; The elekshen uv troo Dimekrats to good payin offises; The enforsement uv the laws; The resistin uv conskripshen and enrolin offisers; Morality and good order; The mobbin uv Methodis, Presbyterin, Luthrin, Brethrin, and uther hetrodox churches. I appele confidently too the Dimokrasy for support. The actooal, ginooine principles uv Dimokrasy need a able defender, and I 'm the identicle individooal. My hole sole is in the coz, and I am pecooliarly fitted by eddicashen and tastes for the posishen. I bleeve the speckelashen will pay hevy. My Church welkomed me back with a corjality trooly affectin. They held a festivle on my return, to wich the Sundy-skool skolars wuz present. I unbended myself, and kist em onct apeece, takin a nip of corn essense atween times, wich wuz nessary. Mistakin a mother for her infant, the infooriated husband assaulted me.

      <field name="fulltext">XXIV. PREACHES AND MAKES A SUDDEN SHIFT. Church uv St. Vallandigum, July the 7th, 1863. I preached last Sunday from the text, “Break every yoke and let the opprest go free.” I went on to show that this text had no reference watever to niggers. Niggers wuz ordained 2 be bondmen, from the very day Noah took a overdose uv the great happyfier, and cust Canaan. But the text, like the Deklarashen uv Independense and the ever-blessid Constitooshn, wuz made solely for white men. It hed undoubted reference to the payin uv debts. Wat heavier yoke is ther than notes? and who is more opprest than he who pays ten per cent.? “Burn yer notes, and let yer debtors go free,” wood be a more correcter readin uv the passage. In our biznis meetin in the afternoon, the question uv the draft wuz considered. It was plain that the enrolement cood not be prevented. The enrolin orfisers hed managed to do it, and it wuz a sertinty that every name atwixt 18 and 45 wuz down. And we were also satisfied that the draft cood be enforst, and there4 it behooves us to make it ez light ez possible, more espeshly ez when wun uv us is draftid, he will hev 2 to go, not hevin the nessary 300 dollars. It is here ez it is in all excloosivly Dimekratik communities— the grocery keepers absorb all the capital. The follerin resolutions were past: Wareas, Our nashen is involved in a horrible, fratrisidle war, the same bein unholy, and waged solely 2 free the nigger and enslaiv the white man, wich is therefore our duty to oppose the same; therefore, be it Resolvd, That we are in favor uv raisin our quota by volunteerin, and hereby urge the same. Resolvd, That we consider the employment uv niggers, ez soljers, ez not only justifiable, but highly commendable. Resolvd, That a committee be appinted to sekoor the settlement uv 2 hundred families uv niggers in this township, excloosivly for volunteerin purposes. The resolooshens wuz past, and the committees appointed. The very next day we heerd uv Vicksburg and Gettysburg. I to wunst blew the horn and got my flock together, told em the news, and offerd the following resolooshens: Wareas, Our beloved country is involved in a bloody war against rebels and traitors— (A old man interrupted me, sayin, “W-h-a-t?” Payin no attenshen, I proceeded.) And in sich a crisis the dooty uv every troo citizen is to sustain the guvernment; therefore, be it Resolvd, That the Dimokrasy are, ez they alluz hev bin, in favor uv a viggerus prossekooshen uv the war. Resolvd, That our confidence in the great Vallandigum is unabated; and, bleevin him to be the only actooal war man in Ohio, shel give him our harty support. Resolvd, That the reports uv troubles in Ohio and Ingeany is lies, got up to deseeve the people. The resolooshens wuz past, tho I had to tell em twice to vote for em. We immejitly hunted up 2 enrollin orfisers, who we tarred and feathered sum weeks ago, jest after Hooker wuz defeated by Lee at Chanslerville, when we spozd our Suthern brethrin wood triumph, and giv em a public dinner. Ef all the leaders of the Dimokrasy were ez sagashus ez me, the old party wood hev smooth sailin. Alas! how few hev the gigantik intellek uv Nasby! I hev written to my frends, advisin em to shift ez soon ez possible. Petroleum V. Nasby, Paster uv sed Church, in charge.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">XXV. OBSERVES A DAY OF FASTING. Church uv St. Vallandigum, July the 20th, 1863. Yisterdy wuz set apart by my congregashen ez a day uv fastin and humiliashen for our misforchunes at Gettizberg, and the loss uv Port Hudson and Vixburg. I ishood the follerin direxshens for the proper observance uv the fast, to-wit: 1. Nip before breckfust not 2 eckseed two jills. 2. For breckfust no animil food permitted, ceptin ham and eggs, beef, etz. 3. For dinner, ditto; supper same ez on uther daze. 4. Beer 2 be taken by the single glass, and pretzels to be eaten without salt on em. 5. These rules to be void in the case uv peepil over 35 and invalids, who may hev ther sustainin flooids ez usual. I preecht frum this text, “O, mi sole, why art thow cast down?” I told em we wuz cast down becoz uv Meed's whippin Lee; becoz uv Grant's takin Vixburg, and Banks's takin Port Hudson. That 's what 's the matter with us. That 's what hez cast a shadder over owr countnansis, and changd the hue uv our nozes from the brilyunt crimsun to the gastly bloo! The flattrin hopes uv a successful invashen uv the North is dasht— likewise the releef uv Vixburg, and now, to fill our cup uv sorrer, Jon Morgan's command is destroyd. But still, my frends, ther is a silver linin 2 evry clowd—wich is poetry. There is wun ray uv hope amid all this gloom. I allood 2 the late constooshnal demonstrashens in Noo York. Ther wuz a victory. The draft-books wuz destroyed and the draft wuz stopped. But ther wuz a bigger triumph than stoppin the draft. Niggers wuz killd—the prowd Anglo-Saxn riz in his mite and stoned the niggers! Halleloojy! At this pint sum uv the awjence becum sleepy, and to arowse them I becum faseshus. Why, sez I, wuz the Dimokrasy, who mauld the niggers in Noo York, a most ennerjetic and perseverin people? Becoz, anserd I, they left no stone unturned 2 effect their purpus. The ijee uv interdoosin conundrums in2 the pullpit is orijenel with me. I closed by exhortin uv em too stand firm. Ef we kin elect Vallandigum, we may yet check the Fedral guvment in its victorus carere. With Ohio all rite for constooshnal rites, the game uv subjoogashen wood be playd out. Let us, sed I, never falter nor faint, but press onnard 2 the mark uv our high callin. Ez the Isrelites threw down the walls uv Gerryko by blowin rams' horns, so kin we by blowin our horns throw down the walls of this Abolishn Gerryko. Blow your horns, my brethrin; for whoso bloweth not his own horn, the same shall not be blown, but whoso bloweth his own horn, the same shall be blown with a muchness. We took a numerashen uv owr Church with a vew to the draft, with the follerin result: Hole number uv male members, 200 Over 45, 50 Under 18, 50 Badly rupcherd, and utherwise diseasd, 92 Gone to Canady 2 visit ther uncles, 8 Total 200 We are easy in our minds on this subjic.

The marter wuz holdin a resepshun at the Clifton House wen I arrove. He caught site uv me ez soon ez I entered the room, and he rusht in2 my arms, and droopin his head on2 my heavin buzm, weept aloud: “Marterd saint!” sez I, with a voice tremulous with emoshen. “Sufferer fer truth!” sez he; and then this trooly grate man whispered, “Jest keep in this posishn a minnit—the artist uv the Noo York Illustratid Flapdoodle is makin a sketch uv us;” wich we did, standin locked in2 each other's arms, and weepin profoosely fer 15 minits. It wuz exhaustin and tiresum, but fer the cause I endoord it. The picter will appear in next week's Flapdoodle, headed “The 2 Grate Minds uv the Age!

After the Eastern delegashen hed gone thro the cerrymony uv kissin his feet, wich cleaned em, he dismist em, and we wuz alone. “Nasby,” says the great C. L., “how is things in my nativ state?” “Squally,” sez I. “Wat wuz the pervalin sentiment uv the people as to my eggsile?” “They wuz extremely glad uv it.” “The akount uv my prostrashen—my untold suffrins, et settry, wich I hed publisht in the papers; did that not affect them?” “Yes; they left.” “Did not the affectin akount uv the wife uv my buzm and my cherub babes a jinin me here, 2 share my lonely eggsile, move em?” “Nary move.” “Nasby, the peeple is stun. But I 'll fetch em. `Nil despritrando' is my motto.” After a few moments uv profound silence, he resoomd: “I must be guvner, fer how else kin we prevent the subjugashen uv the Dimekratik staits? Elect me, and therd be no trouble about drafts, onless we shood git involved in a war with the United States. The Confederacy wood be recognized, Ohio wood go with the South, and slavery wood be interdoost, and as we woodent hev eny further use fer em, poor men woodent be allowed to vote, making me perpetooal guvner. Nasby, we must succeed.” “Certainly. But we 're in a tite plais. Our speekers is embarist. It takes a gigantik intellek to bring the pints 2gether. A anicdote: A spritely boy wunst put 200 eggs in a nest for a hen to set on. Sez his maternal mother: “`My son, why puttist thou so many eggs under the hen? She canst not kiver em.' “`Certinly she canst not; but, thunder! I want to see her spread herself.' “Jest so. Our speakers is in the same fix. The outside egg in the Dimekratik nest is opposition to the war. Tother side uv the nest, 200 eggs distant, is the support uv the war. To kiver em all requires great stretchin capacity.” “Troo, 2 troo. But we must mix it, and trust to luck. In loyal counties, stuff em with dilooted patriotism; in OUR counties, pure secesh. The people is jest ez gullible now ez ever they wuz.” I left the patriot and sage much comforted. Petroleum V. Nasby, Paster uv sed Church, in charge.</field>

I hed a brother who left his paternal roof in 18forty-nine, fer the perpus uv makin a fortin, a follerin the briny deep. He did n't maik a fortin, however, makin fortins bein a thing fer wich the Nasby family is not cellebratid. He had bin absent all uv the time, and hed heard never a word frum his naytiv land. He went frum this county, and wen he landid at Noo York, he cum strate 2 this plais. I reseeved him with open arms. “Josef,” sez I, “do yoo still remane troo 2 the Dimekratik faith?” “Petroleum,” sez he, “I do. Ez wuz resolvd in our konvenshun the yere afore I startid, I bleeve that slaivry is a evil, and that the Dimokrasy uv Ohio shood use all constooshnel means to mittygait and finelly eraddycait it, and”— “Hold,” sez I, “times is changd. The Dimokrasy now look upon slaivry ez a blessin; but, go on.” “I bleeve,” resoomd he, “that the settlin uv the question uv slaivry by the Missory Compermise wuz rite; and”— “Hold on,” sez I, “we repeeld the Compermise.” “I bleeve,” retorted he, feebly, “that slaivry is the creecher uv lokle legislashen, and shood be exclooded frum the territories; and”— “Stiddy,” sez I, “the Dimokrasy is in favor uv extendin it all over the territories.” “Well,” sez Josef, sez he, “I 'm fer the Union, wun and indivizable; that 's Dimokrasy, aint it?” “Yes,” sez I, “with sevral ifs and much buts. We are jest now, ez a party, ingaygd in the deliteful work uv splittin up the old Union in2 4 parts, as per Vallandigum. Josef, your behint the age. You see, Josef, we wuz fer the Union, wun and indivizable, jest so long ez the Dimokrasy, wich wuz mostly lokated Sowth, hed controle uv sed Union. In them days Noo England wuz under. Then things changd. Noo England spred over the West, and ther wuz danger uv losin the controle. To check em, we commenst legislatin; fustly repeelin the Compermise, so they mite take niggers ther, if they cood git in fast enuff. That wuz a failyer. Then we decided that the constooshn pertected slaivry, and that it cood go ther anyhow. Still Noo England beet us, electin a Abolishn President, and we bolted, so that we cood git shet uv New England. And that 's wat the war's about.” Sez Josef, sez he: “Petroleum, to me it doth seem that all that 's left uv the Dimokrasy, to which I wunst belongd, is the naim.” 2 which I sentenshusly replide: “It air.” Sez Josef, sez he, “Petroleum, I can't git it thro me. Ef I hed staid at home, perhaps I mite hev took these changis down, wun at a time, but at wun dose it 's 2 much. Therefoar, Petroleum V., consider me owt. The old flag 's good enuff fer me, I thank you, and Androo Jaxn wuz abowt the style uv a Dimekrat you mite bet yer bottom dollar on. I repoodiate the hull on 't. I do n't like egg-shells, ner nuthin wat aint got no meet into it; by wich strikin mettyfor I meen to say that a party that hez dispozd uv its prinsipples, and lives on a empty naim, aint the assosiashen fer any body but a low graid uv ijeots, and a high graid uv skoundrels, sech ez would garrote the Goddis uv Liberty fer the white cotton nite gownd she is piktorelly represented ez wearin.

      <field name="fulltext">XXVIII. CONFESSION OF FAITH. Church uv St. Vallandigum, Orgust the 31st, 1863. We hed the glorusist kind uv a seesun yisterday. The winders wuz opend, and a showr uv pure Dimekratik grace desendid upon us, and we wuz blest. Glory! We reseeved into our Zion 18 young men, who reseevd the faith by inheritance, ther fathers hevin alluz voted the strait ticket. The follerin is the Confeshun uv Faith too wich they subscribed: Queshn—Dostest thow bleeve that Canaan wuz doomd to bondig becoz uv Noer's gittin tite; that Hayger and Onezimus prove the skriptoorality of the fugytiv-slaiv law; that, taken ez a hull, they show that the ketchin uv niggers with dorgs is commendible and evangelikle? Dostest thow bleeve that the present war is unconstooshnel and unholy; that it wuz brot on by the Abolishnists interferin with slaivry; that the bombardment uv Sumter wuz rite, tho hasty? Dostest thow bleeve that Linkin is a tyrent and usurper; that he hed no rite too subjoogait the Sowth; that his callin out troops wuz unconstooshnel; and that every thing he hez dun, since the war begun, is likewise unconstooshnel? Dostest thow bleeve that Vallandigum wuz sent in2 the world to save the Dimekratik party; that in doin it he wuz arestid at Dayton, tride afore Ponteus Burnside, and sent Sowth; that, after 3 months, he riz agen in Canydy, whense he shel cum ez soon ez hese electid, and Pooh goes after him with 300 thowsan? Dostest thow take the Crisis? Dostest thow bleeve that the sentrel committis is the sole dispenser uv opinyun, and wiltest thow alluz yawp wen they wink? Dostest thow bleeve that skratchin a tikkit is the onpardonable sin? Dostest thow bleeve that this war wuz got up to free niggers, and that to-day Linkin hez 75,000 niggers in the North, a feedin on fride oysters and hot punch? Dostest thow bleeve that Lee is the greatest gineral uv the age, and that all reports uv Fedral victries is lies? Dostest thow bleeve Ben Butler's a beast, and Hamlin a mulatter? Wiltest thow pledge yurself 2 uncompremisinly oppose yure sisters marrying niggers, no matter how much they want to? 2 all uv these questuns the candidates anserd: “I dost.” Bro. Tuttle extendid the rite hand uv fellowship, and after making a × to their names, wich I hed previously ritten in our church-book, they wuz made members of my flock. The coz is prosperin. We commense a series uv revival meetins next week, and hev made extensiv preparashens therefor. 10 barls of condenst Dimokrasy, 20 barls uv beer, and 300 yards uv bolony hez bin pervided.

      <field name="fulltext">XXIX. PREACHES—SUBJECT, “GIVIN.” Church uv St. Vallandigum, September the 21st, 1863. I preeched yisterday frum this text: “Verely I say unto yoo, it is moar blesseder toe give than toe reseeve.”—Joab xvii: 313 to '21, incloosiv. The inspird riter hed, no dout, the Dimekratik party in his mind's eye, wen he rit them words uv wisdom. Experence hez shode the trooth uv them sentens, and ef it hadent, youd be bound to bleeve it, coz I, your paster, sez so, wich is Dimokrasy. To illustrait, we shell inquire: 1. Wat is givin? Givin is givin, wich is suffishently cleer explanashen fer all practikle perpuses. 2. Wen shood we giv? This pint reqwires moar eloocydashen. We must giv alluz, fer it is moar blessider toe giv ner toe reseeve. The Dimokrasy hez alluz bin scriptooral in this partikeler. Wen the Sowth wantid Misoory, we giv it. Wen she wantid a fugytiv-slaiv law, we giv it. Wen she wantid Texis, and Kansas, and Nebrasky, we giv it—halleloogy! Wen she wantid Bookannon, we giv it; and wen she demandid Duglisses hed, we giv it, fer it is moar blessider to giv ner it is to reseeve. 3. Why shood we giv? Becoz it pays. So long ez the Dimokrasy hed the power uv givin, all wuz well. The Sowth, hevin all it wanted, wuz contentid, and evry thing went on smooth and plesent like. Nacher intended em to rool, and us uns to serve, and we wuz satisfide, and so wuz they. Such offisis ez wuz benethe em, they tost to us, and all wuz peese. It wuz normel. 4. Wat hez bin the consekencis uv not givin? My frens, seest thou yon post-orifise? A Abolishnist sets there. And woe is us! the plasis we onct did fill all ore the land, we fill no moar. And wuss. Ther is war; the North hez rebeld aginst the Dimokrasy, and to-day yoor sons is being dragged to the tented feeld, to be offered up a sakrifis to the fell sperit uv “not givin.” O, my frens, we stumbled ourselvs. We faild to giv wunst, and that failyour wuz fatle. Wen we in our pride defide the Sowth at Charleston, we sinned, and air now payin fer it. O, hed we all yoonited in givin, then—hed we follered presedent and got down into the dust—then all wood hev bin well. We dedooce from the foregoin the follerin grate trooth, to-wit, viz: Suffrin alluz follers sin. Nether duz the sinner git the price uv his sin. The demon uv Abolishnism, er Not Givin, wich is sinonymus, held afore the eyes of Duglis the dazzlin prospek uv Northrin votes. But lo! wen Duglis hed took the fatel step, the votes wuz Linkin's, and the post-orfises wuz Linkin's, and the Dimokrasy supped on sorrer and brekfasted on woe. Ther is, my brethren, a hevy cuss on Not Givin. “Wo unto yoo fer a stiff-necked and rebelyus people.” (Abiram 31, 5, xlp.) In the originel Rooshen it is “stiff-backt” instid uv “stiff-neckt,” wich makes it mene Massychusetts. They wood never bend a inch; they hed no limbernis, and with head up, instid uv down—with backs strate, instid uv curvd—they insisted on bein men ez well ez Virginny, thus forcin the Sowth to take up arms to bend em into ther nateral posishen. My frens, this war is a effort on the part uv the Sowth to put down these rebels aginst the grate prinsiple uv Givin. That 's all they want, and wen they git it they 'll stop, I make no doubt. Then, brethrin, let us pray fer their sukcess—let us imytait our martered saint, Vallandigum, who is a exel far away, and, 2 the xtent uv our ability, further the grate coz. Let Noo Ingland be got under; Sumner, and Waid, and Giddins, and Gim Ashly, and Oin Luvgoy hung; the grate Davis President, with Fernandywood and Vallandigum in his Cabynit; then will ther be for us peece, and harmony, and good-will, and post-orfises. Let wat I hev sed sink deep in2 yoor harts. Wen the contribooshen box cums around, remember that “it is moar blesseder 2 give than 2 reseeve.” So mote it be. Petroleum V. Nasby.

      <field name="fulltext">XXX. VISITS CAMP DENNISON TO ELECTIONEER FOR VALLANDIGHAM. Church uv St. Vallandigum, October the 1st, 1863. Feelin it a sakred dooty I owed the coz uv Dimokrasy and free speech, (on awl subgeks not interferin with Dimokrasy ez it hez bin, ez it is, or ez it may be,) I visited Camp Dennyson, wich is naimd after a Abolishnist, to use my stentorin voice fer Vallandigum, among the payrold prizners. It wuz a bammy mornin in September wen I arriv, and procoorin admishen, I set to work to wunst. Noticin a cupple uv duzen uv em a playin poker—1 cent anty—I judged by a instink I hev that ther wuz a good field fer sowin Dimekratik seed. Advansin, I sed: “My frends!” “Wat,” said wun uv em, takin advantij uv the interrupshen to slip a ace er 2 up his koat-sleeve. “My frends,” sed I, “I cum 2 yoo ez a possel uv peece, and a umble advokait uv Dimokrasy, and that persookootid angil, Vallandigum”— “Five aces, Jimuel,” sed the person who fust sed “Wat” to me. “I take the pile, coz yu cant beet five aces;” and sweepin the munny, he remarkt 2 me, “Now, parson, wat did yoo say?” “I cum,” sez I, “in behaff uv the outrajd Vallandigum, who is a exile far away.” I found that the sile uv Camp Dennyson wuz altogether 2 stony to maik preeching for Vallandigum and free speech very pleasent, for no sooner hed the wurds left my lips than a showr uv stuns assailed me; wun, that felt ez tho it wayd a tun, prostrated me. A seriz uv outrajis wuz then perpetrated, wich beggars deskripshun. I wuz peltid with offensive eggs, and rotten cabbig, and decayd pertaters; in fact, at wun time the air wuz so full uv eggs, that I might hev thot, hed I bin poetikle, that the blessid sun wuz a mammuth hen, badly diseazd, and a layin rotten eggs, a milyun a minnit. Finally, wun uv em sez: “Boys, we aint the prizners this feller 's after. Johnson's Island 's wher he wants to go to find his frends.” “Yes,” sed another, “and to git there yoo go by water!” Whereupon, these fiends seezed me and draggd me thro a hoss-troff 15 er a hundred times. Then they pourd cole-ile over me, and wuz a goin to set it afire to dry me, ez they sed, but I broak and fled, pursood by 1000 uv these infooriatid demuns. I finally escaipd, by passin myself orf ez Horris Greely on to a party uv em who stopt me. I am at present confind to my bed, sustanin myself by takin dosis uv terbacker joose from J.

My hart is lead, and my sole is pot-bellied with greef. My lims ake with woe, my manly form is bowd, and my venrable lox is turnd white. O, Vallandigum, thow hast gone to the grave, and in the same toom is berrid all my hopes. Adoo, vane world, adoo! I'll be a nunnery. The fait uv the peeple uv Ohio is seeld. Vallandigum, “Our chosin standerd-barer,” is not only a exile far away, but ther is a cheerful prospek, wich is daily improvin, uv his continnerin in the exile biznis fer an indeffynit period uv time. A tyrannikle Presydent hez taken our old habis corpusses from us, and persistently refuses to furnish us new wuns; and the peeple hevin acqwiest by their votes, we lay bound hand and foot. Men fleein from conskripshen and sich, kin be seezed and dragd in2 slavery; cavelry drest in odjus bloo hez license to hunt the pantin fugitive, who, after drawin his bounty and pay, changis his mind, and desires to return to the buzem uv his family, and the shootin uv enrollin orfisers and tax assessors will now be considered a crime. Alas! The news affectid me variously. I hed our township all fixt, hevin distribbitid tikkits, and knowin nun uv em cood skratch em, ez they do n't rite enny. I reseevd the returns with a gratifide smile. “Bless yoo, my children; you hev dun nobly,” sez I. Presently a currier arrivd, bringin the disturbin intellygens that the northern countis give Bruff 30 thowsen, and 2 minnits thereafter another arrivd statin that the suthrin countis had got loonatik and given Bruff 35 thowsen. With a hart-rendin and sole-tarin shreek, I fell a inannymait corps on the flore. * * * I awoke. A oder uv suthin natrel filled the room, givin me life agin. It wuz whisky. The worthy woman to whose house I board, hed bin rubbin the soles uv my feet with a jug, and givin me small dosis uv the restorer thro a funnel. Her exershens restord me to life agen. I presume the fact uv my owin six months board did not nerve her frajile arm. It wuz revrens. Despondent and weery uv life, I attempted sooiside. I mixt my licker fer a day; I red a entire number uv the Crisis; I peroozed “Cotton is King,” “Pulpit Pollytiks,” and “Vallandigum's Record,” but all in vane. Ez a last desprit resource, I attemptid to pizon myself by drinkin water, but that faled me. My stumick rejected it—I puked. I am 2 much prosteratid to offer either advice or consolashen to my Dimekratik frends. We air in a stait uv abgect cussitude. To see Waid, and Chaise, and Oin Luvgoy, and that 3-ply Abolishnist, Horris Greely, feelin good, is prusic asid and strick9 to us. I shell seek releef from my sorrers in the floin bole. Petroleum V.

Paul, the apossel, on his way frum Geroosalem 2 Damaskus, to persekoot the Crischens, seed a dazzlin lite wich struck him blind. The old Dimokrasy, on the 13th uv October, on its way to Glory, to persekoot the nigger, seed a lite wich nocked it crazy. Wen yu 've suckt a orange dry, natrelly yoo fling away the peel; and if the froot provd sour and bitter instid uv sweet, yoo fling it a good deel further, bein disgustid. Vallandigum's marterdom wuz our orange—we suckt it wiggerously; but, alas! quinine is sweetnis compared to it; to-wit: I fling away the wuthless peel. Myself and flock is now all war Dimekrats. We hev alluz bin. We never agreed with the extreemists uv our party, and we remaned in the organnyzation only becoz, ez members thereof, we cood restrane it frum doing mischif. We wer zealus in the support uv Vallandigum, and workt hard to elect him, only that, being his supporters, and havin electid him, we cood curb him. Therefore, all our apparent opposishen to the war wuz reely its most effishent support. I hope the peeple will see it. At a biznis meetin uv our Church yisterdy afternoon, the follerin resolooshens wuz past: Wareas, Dimokrasy flurishes best wen it is successful; and wareas, it is a tender flower that do n't bare the chillin frosts uv adversity much; and wareas, the peeple hev shode by the pekoolyer stile uv ther votin that they do n't like Vallandigum ner his principples; and wareas, the peeple is uv moar use to us than Vallandigum; therefore be it Resolvd, That Vallandigum never wuz a representativ uv the Dimekratik idee. Resolvd, That we do not indorse his views, or approve his acts, and never did. Resolvd, That honist old A. Linkin, by arrestin uv him, and thereby forsin uv us into committin polittikle sooiside by nominatin uv him, wuz guilty uv a heenus sin. Resolvd, That we aint ez much consernd about our habis corpusses ez we wuz afore the elecshen. Resolvd, That the war for the Union must go on until its enemies is subjoogated, and the banner uv buty and glory waves over every stait; and the Dimekratik committis uv the varius staits be requestid to procoor a sufficient number uv banners, and appint sub-committis to wave em.

      <field name="fulltext">XXXIV. HAS AN INTERVIEW WITH THE PRESIDENT. Church uv St. —, November the 1st, 1863. I felt it my dooty to visit Washinton. The miserable condishon the Dimokrasy find themselves into, sinse the elecshen, makes it nessary that suthin be did, and therefore I determined to see wat cood be effectid by a persnel intervew with the President. Interdoosin myself, I opened upon him delikitly, thus: “Linkin,” sez I, “ez a Dimekrat, a free-born Dimekrat, who is prepared to die with neetnis and dispatch, and on short notis, fer the inalienable rite uv free speech—knoin also that you er a goriller, a feendish ape, a thirster after blud, I speek.” “Speek on,” says he. “I am a Ohio Dimekrat,” sez I, “who hez repoodiatid Vallandigum.” “Before or since the elecshin, did yoo repoodiate him?” sez he. “Sinse,” retortid I. “I thot so,” sed he. “I would hev dun it, too, hed I bin you,” continnered he with a goriller-like grin. “We air now in favor uv a wiggerus prosecushen uv the war, and we want you to so alter yoor polisy that we kin act with you corjelly,” sez I. “Say on,” sez he. “I will. We do n't want yoo to change yoor polisy materially. We air modrit. Anxshus to support you, we ask yoo to adopt the follerin trifling changis: “Restoar to us our habis corpusses, as good ez new. “Arrest no moar men, wimmin, and children for opinyun's saik. “Repele the ojus confisticashen bill, wich irrytaits the Suthern mind and fires the Suthern hart. “Do away with drafts and conskripshens. “Revoak the Emansipashen proclamashen, and give bonds that you 'll never ishoo another. “Do away with treasury noats and sich, and pay nuthin but gold. “Protect our dawters frum nigger eqwality. “Disarm yoor nigger soljers, and send back the niggers to their owners, to conciliate them. “Offer to assoom the war indetednis uv the South, and plej the guverment to remoonerate our Suthrin brethren for the losses they hev sustaned in this onnatrel war. “Call a convenshen uv Suthern men and sech gileless Northern men ez F. Peerce, J. Bookannun, Fernandywood, and myself, to agree upon the terms uv reunion.” “Is that all,” sez the goriller. “No,” says I, promptly. “Ez a garantee uv good faith to us, we shel insist that the best haff uv the orifises be given to Dimekrats who repoodiate Vallandigum. Do this, Linkin, and yoo throw lard-ile on the trubbled waters. Do this, and yoo rally to yoor support thowsends uv noble Dimekrats, who went out uv offis with Bookannon, and hev bin gittin ther whisky on tick ever sinse. We hev maid sakrifises. We hev repoodiatid Vallandigum—we care not ef he rots in Canady; we are willin to jine the war party, reservin to ourselvs the poor privilidg uv dictatin how and on wat prinsipples it shel be carried on. Linkin! Goriller! Ape! I hev dun.” The President replide that he would give the matter serious considerashen. He wood menshen the idee uv resinin to Seward, Chais, and Blair, and wood addres a serculer to the postmasters, et settry, and see how menny uv em wood be willin to resine to accommodait Dimekrats. He hed no dout sevral wood do it to wunst. “Is ther any littel thing I kin do fer you?” “Nothin pertikler. I wood accept a small post-orifis, if sitooatid within ezy range uv a distilry. My politikle daze is well-nigh over. Let me but see the old party wunst moar in the assendency; let these old eyes once moar behold the Constooshn ez it is, the Union ez it wuz, and the nigger ware he ought 2 be, and I will rap the mantel uv privit life arownd me, and go in2 delirum tremens happy. I hev no ambishen. I am in the seer and yellow leef. These whitnin lox, them sunken cheek, warn me that age and whisky hev dun ther perfeck work, and that I shel soon go hents. Linkin, scorn not my wurds. I hev sed. Adoo.” So sayin, I wavd my hand impressively, and walkd away. Petroleum V. Nasby, Paster uv sed Church, in charge.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">XXXV. PREACHES. Church of St. —, June the 9th, 1863. I preeched yisterday frum the follerin text: “What shel we do to be saved?” This, my brethrin, is a important inquiry. Speakin ez a Dimekrat, who for thirty yeres hez never scratched a tikkit—vewin things frum a Dimekratik stand-pint—I hev no hesitashen in sayin that we need savin in a eminent degree. The dark waives of fanattycism, wich wuz mear rippels in 1856, were mountin-high in '60, and now they roll uncheckd frum Calyforny 2 Mane. One island is yet unsquelched. Noo Jersey yet is troo to Dimokrasy—a oasis amid the sterile desert, a green spot by the wayside, a beekon-lite to the shipwreckd maryner, a whisky-jug in Mane. Thank hevin for Noo Jersey—halleloogy! I am prowd 2 say that I, yoor paster, wuz born in Noo Jersey; that my father sawd wood for the President uv the Camden and Amboy, and my mother wuz his washerwoman. Umble wuz our lot; but wat sez the good book? “It is better to be a dore-keeper at the house uv Dimokrasy than a postmaster in the tents uv Ablishnism.” But 2 resoom: Wat shel we do to be saved? This inquiry is uv pekoolyer intrest jest now. Let me ask, why do we need savin? Dimokrasy is the pure, refind salt uv the guverment—to speek uv salt savin is a absurdity. Ah! my frends, wile Dimokrasy savd the guverment, the guverment savd Dimokrasy. It wuz a strikin illustrashen uv the eternel fitness uv things. So long ez my venrable frend hed a post-orifis, he wood be wuss nor a loonatik ef he did not sustane the guverment that give him the post-orifis. Every thing went on, so long ez we hed the post-orifises. Wat we want just now is votes; and how to get em is the question. Whisky used to do it; but, alas! the amount uv whisky nessary to convert a Ablishnist to Dimokrasy wood kill him afore he cood vote—they not being seasond vessels. We lost control, my brethren, by bein stubborn. O! let us dodge that fatal errer. The last elecshen shode that we cood not lede the people— let the peeple lede us. Ef the peeple want war, let us be war men; ef they want peece, let us sing hosanners to peece! Ef they want war in Ohio, let Ohio Dimekrats be war men, and ef Noo York wants peece, let em be peece men. Our platform is broad enuff to accommodait all; and on the mane question, which is post-orifis, we kin all agree—halleloogy! Hevin settled the matter uv faith, we will considder that uv work, for faith without works is uv no more use than a whisky-punch without the whisky. Ther must be no draft—the men must be razed by volunteerin. Exstrordinary indoosements must be held out for Abolishnists to enlist; for evry wun who goes, stands a lively chance uv trubblin us no more. We must hev our voters back frum Canady. My frends, ther were enuff good Dimekrats in Canady to hev saved Ohio and Noo York. They must be hum, to wunst. We need em. We hev not suffishently improvd the nigger— we neglectid him. Ther is 2 sides to the war question; but on nigger we air invulnerable. Why? yoo ask. Becoz he has no frends. The Abolishnists air afeerd to defend him, and by talking uv him to them, we hev wun menny a fite. O, bless the Lord for the nigger! He is our tower uv strength. My brethrin, we hev a big job afore us. Let us dally no longer. Think uv the consekences uv another defeet. Sech uv our Dimekratik leeders ez did not git commishns in the army air in a bad shaip. They can't git whisky on tick, forever. Sum uv em hev got so low ez to be obliged to drink dilootid camfene, wich hez a bad effek upon the stumick. I tride it wunst. They must be releevd. They must hev their posishens and ther regler salaries, for without em ther stumicks is gone. Brethrin, to the breech, to wunst. My Church depuytized me to assertane the wherabouts uv sum Dimekrat who hez n't exprest a opinyun sinse the war commenst, and tender him the nominashen for the Presidensy. Petroleum V.

      <field name="fulltext">XXXVI. PROPOSES TO RESTORE THE UNION. Church uv St. —, November the 20th, 1863. Ther is but jest wun way by wich this wunst happy, but now distractid, govement kin be reyoonitid, and that way I hev diskoverd, and shel apply for a pattent thereon. It is, breefly, this: The holdin uv a jint nashnel convenshun, in wich each Dimekratik delegait shel hev 12 voats, to a Ablishnist's one, for the purpus uv preservin a ekillibrum, wich is nessary. The restorashen uv the Unyun ez 't was, to akomplish wich feet, the convenshen shel nomminait them pure patriots and hi-minded staitsmen, Jeems Bookannon and Jon C. Brekinrij, for President and Vice, who shel be electid by the Northrin staits, ez a slite token uv remorse for wat they hev dun. The eleckshen to be held next spring, and the inoggerashen, and consekent distribbushen uv orfisis to foller immejitly, that the fatheful may be consiliatid, and the whisky intrest releeved, ez soon ez possible. Bookannon shel git together sich uv his old 9 Cabbynit ez hevent died er turnd Ablishnist, (ther plasis to be filld with sich men ez Fernandywood and Vallandigum.) The present war wood, uv coarse, stop, becoz our inflaimd Suthrin brethrin wood hev nothin watever to fite for, hevin considdably more than they ever askt for, wich is hily Dimekratik. Then the armies wood be jined under the command uv that emmynent cheeftain, General Lee, with that uther overpowrin stratejist, McClellen, (hoo resembles him in every thing ceptin his ability,) ez his sekond, the Confedrit offisers bein all promoted to briggadeers. That the amount uv steelin nessary to soothe the Suthrin mind may be hed, I sejest a war with the French, lookin to the conquest uv Mexiko. This wood be a killin uv 2 birds with wun stun, to-wit: 1. Affordin the Suthrin brethrin a opportoonity uv makin good ther lossis in this war, by takin fat contrax in the next; and, 2. We wood hev Mexiko to divide up into slaive staits, killin Noo Ingland completely. Wich wood soothe the Suthrin mind, and squench the Suthrin hart. Congris shood immejitly pass a act makin it treezn, punishable with deth, to refooze Confedrit skrip ez payment for prodoose uv awl kinds, and also to pay off the Confedrit war debt befoar eny thing else is did. I maik no doubt that a large number uv fanattix in the north will obgekt to this consillatory polisy, but I care not. Our gelloreous Constooshn wuz a compermise, and ef it is preserved to us, it will be by compermise. No troo Dimekrat, who hez the good uv his party at hart, will say nay to enny uv these proposishens. Ablishnists and week-need Dimekrats may obgect on the ground uv the perpetuation uv the slaivry feecher uv the skeem. To me this hes nary terer; on the contrary, I like it much. Slaivry is a huje Juggernaut. Jest so long ez we Northren Dimekrats lade flat in the mud afore its wheels, we wuz not injoord, but merely shovd further in2 the mire, puttin us, however, in the eggsact posishun to ketch the ile that dript frum the axels. But wen we tride to stand afore it, we wuz smashed. Duglis wuz a eminent wictim.

      <field name="fulltext">XXXVII. SUBMITS A PLAN FOR THE SALVATION OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY. Church uv St. —, December the 2d, 1863. I am not apt to change. Ez the Samist sez, “Wunst I wuz yung, but now I am old;” but yung er old, it has alluz bin the saim with me. Whisky strate hez bin my bevridge, and Dimokrasy my tikkit, wun and inseprable, and I hev stuck to em with a fidelity ekaled by few and serpast by nun. But the time hez cum fer a raddykel change, in order to saiv the good old party I hev ornamented so long. My reezens are these: The rebelyun is played out. Our Suthern brethrin is gone in. To use figgerativ langidge, wich will be understood in the circles in wich I am akustomed 2 move, Linkin has made 4 alreddy, and holds high, low, and jack. So long as ther wuz any chanse for the 15 Dimekratik staits to succeed, it was natrel for us to help em, for then we cood ezy jine with em agin; but ez they are past prayin for, wat is wisdom for us? Clerely to help wipe em out. Why? In my skriptooral reedin I wunst found a histry uv a steward who wuz about losin his plais. Like Hamlick, he soliloquizd, “Wat kin I do? I can't work, I do n't fancy beggin, and hev n't got the greenbax to start a grosery.” (Groseries wuz cash in Judee.) A lucky thot emergd frum his Websterian intellek. “I hev it,” sez he to hisself. “I am yet steward. I will giv receets in full to them ez owes my boss, and wen my day uv trubble cums, I 'll board with em.” The pint is plane. Wile in the serviss uv our Suthrin masters we wuz rayther hard on our Afrikin brethrin. We did beat em, and choak em, and did despitefully use em. We can't count on the Sutherners no more—let us elevait the nigger to the plais his master okepide in the party. Like the steward aforesed, let us do good to them we was wunst tuff on, that we may hev frends wen we need em. Let that hory old dotard, Tawny, be assassynated, and sum wun appinted in his plais, that will reverse his decision that they hedent eny rites that wite men was bound to respeck; let Samcox and Fernandywood interdoose bills abollyshin slaivry in the staits, and givin evry Afrikin brother a quarter secshun uv land, a 2-hoss teem, a red bunnit with artefishel flowers on to it—maik em sittyzens, and then— We 'd get evry wun uv em. This wood give us the fifteen Suthrin staits as in the happy daze uv yoar, and the 500,000 uv our cullerd brethrin, now in Canady, cood be brot back to the land uv their nativity, and distribbited thro Ohio and Noo York, so ez to redeem them staits frum the rule uv misgided Abolish—I meantersay, Republikins. This plan is feezible, and pekoolierly adapted to the Dimekratik mind, wich is flexyble—very. Let it be adoptid, and wunst more will the good ole party repose under the shadder uv the Trezury bildins; wunst agin will the chozn few dror regler salaries; and the nashen flurish under the blessins we lost wen Bookannon, the gileless, retird to privit life.

      <field name="fulltext">XXXVIII. TAKES A RETROSPECTIVE VIEW. Church uv the Slawterd Innocents, } (Lait St. Vallandigum,) December the 11th, 1863. Yisterdy I heerd a Ablishnist remark: “The world moves.” The observashen (wich I hev heerd frequently uv lait) set me into a trane uv refleckshen. My comprehensive mind sprang back into the misty days uv the past, and I wuz a boy agin. Twenty-six years ago I wuz a splittin my symetrikle throte a hollerin for Van Booren. Them wuz the pammy days uv Dimokrasy. Androo Jaxn hed left us his naim ez capital for us to do biznis on, wile he wuz out uv the way, and coodent interfere with our steelin, wich wuz comfortable. We wuz beeten, but wuz still strong and viggerous, knowin that we cood manaje to live doorin Harryson's reign on wat we hed stole doorin Van Booren's, the fasilites havin been unlimitid. O, them times! Ther wuz Cass, and Davis, and Dickinson, and Calhoon, and Tooms, and Bill Allen, and Duglis, (who wuz jest comin in,) and Ritchy, and Benton, and Isaer Rynders, and Wise, and Yankee Sullivan—a gelloreous galaxy uv intellectooal and muskeler Dimokrasy, sech ez the world never seed afore, and never will agin. Wuz Abolishnism tolratid in them happy daze? Not enny. O, with what arder Luvjoy wuz shot at Alton! How wiggerusly the Dimokrasy laberd to throw his press in2 the turbid waters uv the Missisipi! Wood, O wood that we cood hev sunk his doctrins with his press! Did we allow Abolishn talk? Nary. These stalwart arm hev hurled baskitfuls uv unsavry eggs at the pedlers uv polittikle heresy, and my skill in eggin Abolishn lecterers wunst made me justis uv the peese in my native township. In the South, every hill-side wuz dottid with the carcasses uv Noo Ingland skoolmarms, who, hevin bin suspected uv teechin niggers to rede, wuz justly hung; and the pleasent crack uv the whip wuz heerd all over the land. O, them Arcadian days, wen it only took 20 minits to arrest, try, sentence, hang, and divide the close uv a Yankee skool-teecher! But, alas! heresies crep in2 our ranks, and ther wuz confooshun. Van Booren bolted and bete Cass; and, notwithstandin he repentid afterward, the Abolishon pizon he interdoost in2 the Dimekratik body pollytik, remaned. It broke out in ugly sores in Ohio, in 1848, in the shaip uv the feendish Free-sile party. Then Chaise and Brinkerhoof sluffed orf, and jind with our ainshent enemies. Jest afterward the Anti-Nebrasky excitement, cuppled with No-nothinism, whaled us, and it wuz only by sooperhooman eggsershens that we electid Bookannon. Since, it hez bin nothin but disaster. Bookannon and Duglis got by the ears; Duglis refoosed to cave to his Suthrin brethrin; Linkin wuz electid; war ensood; and now wat do these old eyes behold? Cass, and Ben Butler, and Logan, and Dix, and Dickison, and Dave Tod, strikin hands with Josh Giddins and Horris Greely! It is a singeler fact that every leader we used to trust is now agin us. And wuss. Abolishn papers is bein publisht in South Karliny, in Tennisee, Kentucky, and Loozeaner, and a millyun uv men, led by the ghosts and ghostesses uv them hung skoolmasters and skoolmarms aforesaid, assisted by John Brown's soul, wich is littrally a marchin on, is enforcin a proclamashen freein all the niggers at wun stroak, and the Dimokrasy, bein sum hundreds uv thowsends in the minority, is powerless to prevent it. Trooly, the world moves. It hez moved the Dimokrasy from the pedestal uv power it wunst okepide, and laid it prostrait. It hez elevatid men we despised, and adoptid idees we scoft at. Yunger men may shift and git in2 the tide agin, but ez for me, I can't. I shel maik wun moar effort, and if we fail—why, then, I shel withdraw frum public life, and start a grocery, and in that umble callin will flote peecefully down the streem uv time, until my wether-beten bark strikes on the rox of deth, gittin my likker in the menetime (uv wich I consume menny) at wholesail prices.

      <field name="fulltext">XXXIX. COMMUNES WITH SPIRITS. Church uv the Slawterd Innocents, } (Late St. Vallandigum,) December the 19th, 1863. I hev bin for menny years disposed to bleeve in speritooalism. Ther is suthin pleasent in the idee uv bein in communicashen with them ez hev gone before, as it may be reznable supozed that frum their stan-pint they kin see things in a more clearer lite than we who is encumbered with clay. Akordingly, I invited a distingisht mejum to visit my flock. * * * A circle wuz formd, and I wuz requestid to call for the sperit uv sum wun. Hevin a few Abolishnists present, whom I wisht to enliten on politikle topix, I cald for Tomus Jefferson. “Tomus,” sez I, “wuz yoo the father uv Dimokrasy?” (I use my own langige, ez them old fellers wuz not alluz elegant.) “I wuz.” “Tomus, are the party now barin the name yoor child?” “Not any. It 's a mizable bastard, born uv John C. Calhoon, and that old hag, Stait-Rites, and a low-lived whelp it is. My heirs is them ez supports the guverment I help to maik.” “But, Tomus, wood yoo hev us support a Abolishn war for the purpus uv freein niggers?” The sperit rapt out with awful distinknis: “We hold these trooths to be self-evident, that awl men is creatid ekal, and endoud with certing inaleyenable rites, among wich is life, liberty”— At this pint I stopt the mejum. I knew the sperit wuz not Tomus Jefferson, but a imposter, hevin heerd a Abolishn preecher use the same langige at a 4th uv Guly celebrashen. I then cald Androo Jaxn, hoo respondid: “Androo,” sez I, “woodent yoo like to be back on yearth, jist now?” “Yoo kin bet I wood,” retortid he. “I 'd like to hev bin President in the place uv that old, white-liverd, black-cockade Fedralist, Bookannon. Wat a hangin ther wood hev bin! Ther wood hev bin vacansis in Congris, and jest ez menny funerals ez ther wuz vacansis. As for Sowth Carliny”— The communycashen ceasd, and I heerd a sound like the grittin uv teeth. It resoomed: “I 'd string up Vallandigum, and Fernandywood, and Sammedary, et settry. It wood be a bad old joke on them indivijjles ef I hed controle of the habis corpus; I 'd”— I refoozed to hear further. This sperit wuz, also, ondoutedly a impostor. I cald for Benton, who merely sed that Miszory wuz comin to her senses in gittin rid uv slaivry; and for Duglis, who remarkt that he cood say uv the temple of Dimokrasy ez the Savior sed of the temple, “My howse is cald a howse of prayr, but ye hev maid it a den of theeves;” both of whom wuz onquestionably impostors. Another sperit (probably of a deceest Ablishnist) sed that Benedict Arnold and Judis Iscariot hadent bin on speekin terms for sum time, Iscariot hevin called Arnold a copperhed. Arnold sed he 'd never stand that. Duglis cum back, and sed he had jest wun word 2 say. “The Dimekratik party wuz wunst grate, but it hed got in2 bad hands, and gone crazy as a drunken bed-bug. It needid new managers— men uv suffishent sense and honisty to run the party on old prinsipples. In the old hands, it wuz a pattryotic party—a party that wuz alluz for the country. It whaled the British in 1812, and afterwards nockt the hind sites off uv the old Fedral party for opposin it. It smasht Mexico, and afterwards smasht the Whig party for not helpin. Now, for the Dimokrasy to oppose a war agin rebels who not only commenst it, but hed actooally bustid the party itself, is loonacy unekaled in the histry uv the world. Squelch them tuppenny pollytishns who hev theeved the mantels wunst worn by Jaxon and Benton, (they look in em jest about as well as a orgin grinder's munky wood in a soljer's overkote, and fill em jest as much,) got on to a war platform, and”— I did n't care about persooin my investigashens enny further, pertikelerly ez the Abolishnists wuz all a snickrin. It 's my privit opinyun that ther 's nothin relyable about it. Hed the sperits bin reely them uv Jefferson, Jaxon, and sich, they woodent hev talkt so much undilootid niggerism. However, it did me very well. The mejum took up a colleckshun uv six dolars, wich, by a singler coincidence, was the eggsact amount I hed intendid to charge him for the use uv my church. He grumbled, but finelly sheld out. I am now warin a new pare uv pants. Petroleum V. Nasby, Paster uv sed Church, in charge.</field>

The idee plezd my congregashen vastly, and fifteen or twenty uv the strongest perposed that it shood be put into practis, jest 2 show the world that the grate doctrine cood be carried out jest as well in the North as in the South; to wich I assented to wunst, and at the next biznis meetin, the follerin plan wuz adoptid: The members uv the congregashen shood try ther strength, and them as cood lift 600, shood own and possess, in fee-simple, all them ez coodent.

But, alas! owin 2 the perversity uv the human mind aforesaid, it dident work. Old John Podhammer razd his 600 with the gratest eaze, wile Bill Sniffles, who wuz a workin for him for 12 dolars a munth, coodent fetch it. Podhammer went over to Bill's cabin the next mornin, and sez he: “Wilyum, frum this time, hentz4th and furever, yoo air my man. As all a slaiv has is his master's, the 18 dolers I owe yoo, or that I did owe yoo afore this blessid system wuz establisht, I shel keep, and as yoo hev more furnytoor than befits yoor lowly condishen, I will send a team over to-morrer, and taik yer bewrow and stand and bedstids up to my house; and”— At this junctur in cums Mrs. Sniffles, who kin lift 600, with old Podhammer on the top uv it, and it wuz no time afore she diskivered wat his biznis wuz. She turnd red in the face. Said she: “Yoor goin to take my furnytoor?” “Certingly.” “And we air yoor slaivs?” “Uv coarse.” “And yoo kin sell my children?” “Naterally.” “And yoo kin maik me yoor conkebine?” “Ef I wish.” “Yoo old beest!” shreekt the infooriated femail chattel, forgettin her normal condishn. “You sell my babies! You taik my furnytoor! Drat ye, I 'll giv ye sum uv it now!” whereupon she hurled a chare, wich laid him prostrait on the flore, wen she pickt him up, and flung him out the dore. It did not end here. Podhammer hed in his hand a patch-work coverlid, wich he thot he wood taik with him, and wen he cum to, he walked off with it, whereupon Mrs. Sniffles hed him took up on a charge uv steelin, and he wuz actooally tride, found gilty, and sent to jail for 30 daze. How kin we establish Dimekratik institooshens wen the courts won't recognize the laws of nacher? The experiment, for the present, hez the apperentz of a failyer. Petroleum V.

We hev bin, ever sence the Ablishnists made war on yoo, workin industrusly for yoo, ez follows: We hev, ez a rool, stood inflexybly opposd to amost evry thing; We preechd that the war wuz a Ablishn war; We preechd agin taxashen; We held forth agin conskripshen We discurigd volunteerin; We encuridgd desershens, and pertektid deserters; 10 We never cood see a Fedral victry; We wuz alluz forst to aknollidge that the South ginerally got the better uv us; We never bleevd that yoo wuz gittin short uv pervishens; We hired niggers to travel North to convince Dimekrats uv the nigger invashen 2 cum; We forst Linkin to retane Micklellan; We aboozd Fremont and Rosycrance; With uther artikkles too noomerus to menshun. But, somehow, it hezent workt. The Confederacy hez bin losin ground with a regelarity friteful to contemplait. In spite uv all we cood do, volunteerin hez gone on, and ef we did kill off a general, another wun jest ez good ariz to take his place. Now, Jefferson, wat kin we do? It is obvus to the most obtoose intellek that the vandals hev got us. Wat shel be the next dodge? Planely, to secoor awl we kin. The Dimokrasy is ready to reseeve yoo with open arms, but yoor repeetid determinashen to die in the last ditch, and sich nonsents, hez bustid us wenever we spoke uv compermise and sich. Jefferson! the last oppertoonity persents itself. Ask for a onerable peece—a peece not burdened with hoomiliatin condishens. We kin engineer it so as to bring yoo back as good ez yoo went out, slaivry safe, yoor war debt assomd by the government, and yoo back in the Senit. We kin hev old Chase, and Waid, and Sumner hung—we kin hev yoor soljers penshund, and the foogytivslaiv law re-enactid, and the territoris turnd over to yoo, and the confisticashen act repeeld, and the emansipashen proclamashen recalled, and yoor niggers restored—the guverment paying for sech ez may hev bin kild—and sech uther laws past ez you wish. Ef Linkin refooses to ackseed to these resonable terms, why, then the responsibility uv continooin a unnachrel and unnessary war is on his sholders, and we hev a ishoo for the next campane—a artikkle we stand very much in need uv. Jefferson! do this, and do it to wunst. Delay may be fatle. He who hezytaits is lost. The vetrans is re-enlistin, and 300 thowsen volunteers, each a John Brown, and led by the original John Brown's ghost, wich is marchin on, is turnin their faces toward Dixie, with bayonits afore em. Ef yoo wait till June, the Confederacy will be smasht so fine that the Dimokrasy won't be able to git together enuff uv it to make a compermise with. Jefferson, ef yoo hev any regard for yerself, er for us, yoor frends, do it. “Virchoo is its own reward.” Be wise in time. Petroleum V. Nasby, Paster uv sed Church, in charge.</field>

Trouble air a cumin upon me thicker and faster. “Men change, but principples, never,” hez bin a motto uv mine for yeers, and bleevin in the grate principple of the strong owning the week—or, in uther words, slaivry—I shel never ceese my efforts to maik it universal. Ther bein a onreesonable prejudis in the minds uv the week uv my congregashen aginst bein the perpetooal servance uv them as nacher hez maid to rool, I called a special meetin of my flock, to considder the matter. I interdoost the matter thus: By Hager, I provd that slaivry was scriptooral. By “cussid be Kanan,” et settry, I shode concloosively that the nigger wuz the identikle indivijjle who wuz to be the sed slaiv aforesed. Then it wuz put to vote, and it wuz unanimusly resolvd, that Aferken slaivry be interdoost amongst us. I notist, with pleasure, that the poorer the indivijjle, the moar anxhus he seemed to own a nigger. Opinyuns were then interchanged. Absolum Kitt, who is a carpenter, and who never saved a dolar, hevin alluz hed a sick wife and a large family of children, sed he felt that a grate work hed bin dun that nite. The prowd Anglo-Saxun, whom nacher intended to rool, hed bin that nite elewatid 2 his normel speer. Hentz4th ther wuz no moar laber for him. He hed a contrak to bild a house for brother Podhammer, and he hed no doubt that the brethrin who wuz blest with menes wood make up a puss, and enable him 2 buy a nigger carpenter to do his work. Brother Podhammer aroze. He, uv coarse, wood be glad to assist brother Kitt, but dooty 2 his family reqwired a diffrent line uv action. His idee wuz to purchis a nigger carpenter hisself, and— “WHAT!” exclaimed Kitt. Brother Podhammer resoomd. He intended to buy a nigger carpenter hisself, and bild his house. The cheef beauty uv the grate system, and the wun that maiks it altogether luvly, is that yoo kin BUY yoor labor. “But,” sed Kitt, “what kin I do if yoo work nigger carpenters?” “Trooly,” sez Podhammer, “I know not. A carpenter kin be purchist for ?1000, the interest uv wich is ?60, and his keepin, say ?100 more, per annum. Now, ef Brother Kitt will cum to them wagis, and be modritly umble, I mite, for his saik, forego the exquisit pleasure uv hevin a nigger to flog, and still employ him.” “But,” sez Kitt, turnin pail, “my family wood starve on them wagis. Wy, I mite ez well be a nigger myself.” At this pint I lifted up my voise. I exorted Brother Kitt to patience. The grate Dimekratik idee, that cappytal shood own labor, must be establisht. It may bare hard upon indivijjles, but wat then? John Rogers went camly to the stake for principple. Ef Brother Kitt doth not like to accept his normel condishen to wunst, he kin go to sum less favored country, wher the grate instooshon is not establisht. Brother Podger, a blacksmith, sed he suppozd the rich uns wood buy a nigger blacksmith, and let him emigrait. Brother Snipes, a plasterer, made a simler obserwashen. Brother Punt, a bricklayer, remarkt likewise. Whereupon they all, in corus, similarly exclaimed they 'd see us d—d fust, and then they woodent. Whereupon they reconsidered the resolushen establishin slaivry. Kitt and his herritix wuz not at church last Sundy, and the postmaster told me that they hed sent orf a club for the Noo York Triboon.

      <field name="fulltext">XLIII. OPPOSES THE NOMINATION OF A MILITARY MAN. Church uv the Slawterd Innocents, } (Lait St. Vallandigum,) January the 21st, 1864. I notis in the Dimekratik papers a desire 2 maik General Micklellan or General Grant our nominee for the Presidency. Sooisidel ijee! I pertest! Time hezn't tetched my floin lox with frost, and furrode my massive brow for nuthin. Peepil hev sumtimes douted my honisty, but my talence, never. I do n't alluz pay, but I never faild in borrerin — wich is useful. Therefoar, I throw myself into the breech, and demand a heerin. I am inflexibly opposed to Micklellan's nominashen. I hev faith in the soundnis uv his Dimokrasy, but nun watever in his ability. Look at it. He wuz placed in a posishen to make the Dimokrasy, but instid he (by weeknis) well-nigh rooind it. He hed under his controle 180,000 Abolishnists. A man uv genius wood hev destroyed em all, wareas he only sunk abowt the haff, levin the rest to live and vote agin us. A nominee uv the Dimokrasy must be a man able to controle uther men. Is he sich? Not enny. Did he not let that born devil, Hooker, and Kerny and Mansfeeld, (who wuz killd, halleloogy!) brake away and fite our Suthrin brethren at Anteetum and elsewhair, killin jest ez menny Suthern Dimekrats ez wuz killd uv the Ablishnists? Troo, he stopt it ez soon ez he cood. Troo, him and Fitsjon Porter lade out Pope, and kep him from beetin our Suthern frends Troo, he did Linkin ez much hurt, and Davis ez much good, ez wuz in him; but the work he mite hev dun wuz only haff dun. His ijee wuz not our ijee. His stratejy wuz to shashay backerds and forerds, until both sides wuz eggsaustid, and then patch up a compermise. We wantid Linkin histid 2 wunst; and hed ther been a proper understandin atwixt him and Lee, Gefferson Davis mite hev bin in the Wite House, and we, the pure Dimokrasy, mite not only hev hed the post-orifises, but hev bin a revelin on the confisticatid estaits uv Abolishnists, wich wood hev bin constooshnel. I hed my egle eye fixt on a sheep-farm uv 360 akers; but, alas! I got it not. Then the iron enterd my sole! Then I cust the imbesility uv the man who swindled me out uv the farm I longed for. I 'll nun uv him. Avant! Ez fer Grant, my sole rekoils with horror at the bair ijee. Wat! nominait a man whose willin sord drips with the gory life-blud uv unwillin Dimekratik saints! Never! Forbid it, hevin! Marry the jentle virgin Peese to a soljer drenchd in goar! I, Nasby, forbid the bans! The trooth is, we air gittin wild. A man can't look 2 ways without doin wiolence to his orgins uv viszhen. Ef persistid in, he 'd bekum crosseyd. We commenst with our facis southward. Ther our hope lies. Let us keep our eyes that way. Ef we nominait a war man, and turn a back spring onto a war platform, wat better air we than the Gentiles? Sech jimnastics are purty to see, but they rench the jimnastist. No! let us go on ez we begun. Ez peece men, our case is not hopeless. The new and unconstooshnel tax onto whisky keeps the orthodox Dimokrasy strate, (tho at our expense,) and a lucky Confedrit wictry in the spring wood turn the week-need war men in2 peese howlers. Good hevins! air we insane? Shel we throw away sech wepins ez taxis, conskripshen, nigger, free speech, et settry, and bow the knee to Linkin? Never! Wat we want is these: 1. A peese man for a candydait. 2. Moar marters. Ef the outrajd Vallandigum, and Jessee Brite, and George E. Pooh wood, for the good uv the party, consent to be driven to desprashen by the tyranny uv the Administrashen, and commit sooiside, it wood be a trump card for us. Wat movin appeals we cood make over ther ded bodiz. I 'll rite to em on the subgik. 3. The formashen uv Ade Sosietis to defray the expensis uv the campane, wich will be enormus, owin to the tax on whisky. 4. Confedrit victrys, and lots uv em, wich not only kills off Ablishn voters, but dishartens the war men North. 5. The libral preechin uv a pure gospil, untaintid with Ablishnism. With these we kin win ez ezy ez I usd 2 turn jack frum the bottom, wen I wuz in a stait uv unrejenerashen. A peese Dimekrat for President! O, happy thot! The forrin mishns! The custom howsis!

      <field name="fulltext">XLIV. PREACHES—SUBJECT: “THE PRODIGAL SON.” Church uv the Noo Dispensashun, } January the 31st, 1864. My Brethren and Sisteren: I shall make sum remarks this mornin based upon the bootiful Parable of the Proddygal Son. I wood reed 2 yoo the passij, but the Bible I hev is the only wun in the township, and I lent it yisterday 2 Square Gavitt, who sed swarin witnesses on almanacs woodent do in hoss cases, and he hasent brung it back. The skripter sez, in substance: Ther was a certin man who hed 2 sons. The yungist hed a taist for that branch uv agricultooral persoots known ez sowin wild oats; so he askt the old man for his sheer uv the estait. He got it, turnd it into greenbax, and went off. He commenst livin high—bording at big hotels, and keepin trottin hosses, and playin bilyards, and sich. In about a year he run thro his pile, and wuz ded broak. Then his credit playd out, and he wuz in a tight place for his daily bred. The idee struck him that he hed better put for hum, wich he did. The old man saw him a cumin, and he run out and met him, and giv him a new cote, and a order for a pare uv shoes, and kild a fat caff, and hed flour doins. The oldest boy obgected 2 these, sayin, “Lo, I hev servd thee these menny yeres, and thou never madest no splurge over me, but when this thy son, who hez fooled away his pile, returns, you kill calves and sich.” Then the old man retorts, sayin, “My son who wuz lost is found; the sheep who went astray is cum back; let us be merry.” My brethren, this parable applize ez well to the present time ez though it wuz made for it. Uncle Samyuel is the old man, the Suthern wing uv the Dimekratik party is the proddygal, and the Abolishnists is the oldest son. The South got tired, and went off on its own hook. It hez, I make no doubt, spent the heft uv its substance, and will shortly conclude to cum home. Now, the grate question uv the hour is—How shel he be reseeved? My frends, the Dimekratik rool is to foller the scripter wen yoo can make a pint by so doin. In this pertikeler case, godlinis is gane. Halleloogy! therefour, let us be godly. Let Uncle Samyuel see the repentant proddygal afar orf— let him go out to seek him, er send Fernandywood, and when he hez found him, let him fall, not upon his neck, but at his feet—let him put on to him the purple robe, wich is royalty, and upon his hand a ring, wich is dominion, wich is a improvement upon Scripter. But the Abolishnist, who is the elder son, steps up and sez: “Nary. He wuz a doin well, and he wented out frum us, takin awl that wuz his own, and sech ez he cood steel, all uv wich he hez spent upon such harlots as Afrikin Slaivry, Stait Rites, and Suthern Independence, wich last two menshund is whited sepulkers. I sent my sons, Grant, and Rosycrance, and Benbutler after him; but, lo! wen he wuz strong and wiggerrus, he did despitefully use them. Now that he is week from hunger, let him brindle. Ef we take him to our buzems, let him cum on his knees; let him cast off the harlots that hev sedoost him, that ther may be no moar trubble in all the land.” My brethren, we must taik him back ez the old man did in the Bible. Why? do you ask. Becoz he wuz alluz the old man's pet, and had things his own way. We wuz his frends, and shared with him the steelins, but sence he went out, the Abolishn brother and his frends hev controld things, and whare air we? Eko ansers, Nowhair! We okepy low plasis in the sinagog, and the doggery-keepers go mournin about the streets, and refuse to be comforted, becoz ther cash is not, and ef we taik back the proddygal, shorn of his strength, uv what avail is he to us? He must cum back ez strong as ever; he must bring his harlots with him—he must ROOL! Then shel we hev the post-orifises, and then shel we agin live on the fat uv the land, dodgin the cuss uv labor. Brethrin, let us be dillygent in this grate work, instant in seeson and out of seeson. A collecshun wuz takin up for the purpus uv sending a mishunary 2 Massychusits, wich yeelded 7 dolars. Ez the amount woodent pay the rale-rode fair, it wuz voted to apply it on repairs on the church, wich I did by havin my boots haff-sold, and buyin a new hankercher. Petroleum V.

      <field name="fulltext">XLV. DREAMS. Church uv the Noo Dispensashun, } February the 6th, 1864. I am no speshel bleever in dreems. The gulf atwixt the material and immaterial worlds is 2 wide to be spand by the bridj uv sleep, or if spand at all, the way is 2 narrer to make safe even the passij uv a nite-mare. [Poeticle idee.] Still, the sperit may, wen loost frum its lode uv clay, sore off in2 the dim fucher, and retane a porshen uv its impreshns when it agin okepies its prison-howse. Last Saterdy nite I hed a dreme. I hed bin a redin “Cotton is King,” and sech works, aidin my understandin with frequent drafts frum a bottel containin “nacher's last best gift 2 man,” and I fell in2 a gentel slumber. I dreemd that the Confederasy hed bin successful, that it carried out its orijinel idee, and hed subjoogatid the Northern Staits. Gefferson Davis wuz roolin at Washington, under the title uv “Gefferson I, Empror uv all the Amerikys.” The Senit and Hows uv Repsentativs hed bin dun away with by decrees, and the biznis uv governin wuz dun solely by the empror and his ministers. All to wunst I wuz in Washington, a rolein along in a gorjus carige. I wuz sumwat surprizd at my persnel apperans. I wuz drest in flesh-culered tites, with sandels on my feet, with dimund buckels onto em, and on my hed wuz a crown, makin me resemble a play acter I seed wunst a playin Richerd. Suddenly the carige stopt, and I alitid, and assended the steps uv the palise. It was a resepshun, and a chamberlin wuz announcin the gests ez they arriv. “Earl von Seymor!” “Count de Richmond!” “Markuis Fernandywood!” and, ez I stept forerd, wat a gush uv exstasy thrild thro my vanes as the chamberlin (who wuz little Samcox,) showtid, “DOOK DE NASBY!” O, wot a moment! My dreems continnerd. Methawt the nobility wuz made up uv the offisers uv the Confedrit armies, and sech Northern men ez hed bin troo to the Confedrisy. The Northern Staits hed bin diwided into dookdums, and erldums, and sich— my territory extending forty miles eech way frum Wingert's Corners, whair my dookal palise wuz sitooated. Niggers wuz dun away with, ez all the whites, excepting the privligd classes, wuz serfs, wich effectooally settled the question uv 11 NASBY'S DREAM OF GREATNESS. 631EAF. Illustration page.

The nobility ownd the land, and the inhabitants wuz all peasantry, payin to the lord uv the soil 4-fifths uv the produx. I wuz livin in stile. We hed subjoogatid the Abolishnists, and wuz usin their leadin men ez our meenyels. O, it wuz magnificent and gorjus! I arose evry mornin with Sumner a holdin a bason, and Waid a pourin uv perfoomd water over my hands, after wich Chase dryd em with towels. They wuz my servance! Poetikle justise. In short, Gefferson Davis, ez soon as he hed the power, hed declaird the idee uv men governin themselves a failyoor, and hed revivd the old foodel system. France and England hed assisted him in establishin hisself, and hed jest got the thing into good runnin order. One seen in my dreem filled me full uv joy. I thot I wuz in my dukel robes, in my ancestrel halls, overlookin my stewart (W. Dennison) a reseevin triboot frum the happy peasantry, wen I notist among em sum who hed refoosed me credit in the days uv the Republic. Rage filled my sole. “Away with the hory miscreance!” showtid I to my armd serviters, “away with em 2 the deepest dunjun neeth the castel mote! ha! ha!” Just then I awoke. It wuz but a dreem, but it left an impreshen on my mind. “If we succeed in smashin Lincoln and his guverment,” thawt I, “a monerkey must ensoo, and, who nose, I may yet be Dook de Nasby!” Filled with new zele, I resoomd labor on my sermon for the morrer, on the unconstooshnality uv the puttin down rebelyuns with muskets, with renood wigger.

      <field name="fulltext">XLVI. TRIES TO AWAKEN AN INTEREST. Church uv the Noo Dispensashun, } February the 10th, 1864. The old Dimokrasy hez lost its anshent sperit. I know not why, but a gloomy forebodin ez to our fucher hez hed poseshun uv my sole for sevral weeks past. I notist that the farmers belongin to my flock wuz a savin up greenbax, and hed quit callin uv em rags; menny refoozd to contribbit to the Vallandigum Fund, and the colleckshun for the benefit uv the Confedrit prizners at Jonson's Iland wuz a totle faleyoor, in consekens uv wich I am doin without a overkote this cold wether, wich is unclerikle. And wuss than this—I hev heerd, resently, members uv the congregashun discussin the skarsity uv laber, and I actooally heerd wun uv em dam Geff Davis, instid uv Linkin! I felt that suthin must be dun, and I set abowt to do it. I hed bin preechin considable on the subgik uv a nigger imigrashen, and ez the dislike uv nigger is cronic in the Dimekratik mind, I thot I wood stir em up with the nigger onct more. So I blackd myself all over, and puttin on a soot uv old cloze, I startid out afore daylite, pintin for Square Gavitt's, who alluz wuz a invetrit hater uv the nigger. The old man saw me a cumin, and I spectid nothin less than a bullet thro me; but for the grate coz, I hed determind to resk even that. But, to my horror, the Square sed good mornin, and askt wher I wuz frum. I told him I wuz a runaway slaiv frum Virginny; that 32,000 startid the same day I did; and that the rest wood be along in a day or 2. I spozd he wood bile at this; but he did n't. He puld from his brestpockit the familyer old bottel, and inwited me to taik hold, wich I did, wondrin why he wuz so plesent to a nigger. Alas for Dimokrasy! I soon found out. HE WANTED 2 HIRE ME to work for him. Ez the words fell frum his lips, I well-nigh fainted; but my consternashen wuz redubbled when he askt me if I coodent git him 3 or 4 more kulerd men! “Kulerd MEN!” thot I, in agony. O, wat a softnin down frum the “Nigger” uv a yere ago! Sadly I retracd my steps. Washing off my disgise, I felt, for the fust time in my life, utterly and entirely retched. Wen Dimekrats git to callin niggers “kulerd men,” and want em to work beside em, and drink out uv the same bottle with em, wat better air they than Ablishnists? The fucher uv the Dimokrasy is, indeed, dark and gloomy. We can't move the peeple ez we ust 2. They pay the taxis, and say they aint so hevy after all. They hev diskiverd that guverment munny is n't wuthless; they won't talk eny more about resistin the draft—on the contrary, they are raisin munny to send Dimekrats into the army, wich alluz cums back rantin Ablishnists, a nockin down peese men and forsin em 2 taik the oath. Farmers endoor the high prices uv prodoose with a pashense and ekanimity wonderful to behold. Yisterday Bill Sipes sold his sorril mare for ?150, and insistid on hevin his pay all in greenbax. I warnd Wilyum uv the risk he wuz runnin in keepin so much uv that stuff, wen he impudently exclaimed, “Stuff! hay! Old Nosey, that 's playd out.” “Old Nosey!” “Playd out!” This to his spiritooal father, his paster, and gide! Whair air we driftin? Wat we are to do to stem the tide that is settin agin us is more than I know. A good, decisiv Confedrit victry wood help us; but, alas! I see no probability uv that. It 's 2 lait to talk uv compermise, for thers hardly enuff left uv the Sowth to compermise with. I 'm sick. I 'm sorry I supported Vallandigum. I wish I hed bin a war man. My congregashen is gittin look-warm, and don't pay ther qwartrage reglar, and the grosrykeepers air intimatin that before long I must begin to pay for my licker! Wher will it end? Petroleum V.

      <field name="fulltext">XLVII. RECOMMENDS UNANIMITY. Church uv the Noo Dispensashun, } February the 19th, 1864. In my boyhood's daze, wen life wuz all a dreme, my buddin genius wuz bein dewelupt a a loggin with oxen. Wun team I hed, wich got insain wun day, and insted uv pullin at the log, ez well-regelatid oxen do, they histid theirselves around, facin each other, and pulled until wun hed dislokatid his neck, and the other I kild with a stun in a fit uv richus rage, and they fed the ravens uv the valley, wich is figgerativ for the children uv the nigger farmer my father borrerd em uv. And here let me say, that, for ginooine, syentific borrerin, the old man wuz ekaled by few, and serpast by nun. He borrerd a hoss uv a dokter, in colera time, wich wuz brillyant; but his shay doover wuz borrerin a new overkote uv a reddy-made clothing man, whose naim wuz Solomons. His last grate feet wuz borrerin a hoss, lait wun nite, for wich he wuz sent 2 the penitenshary, bekoz he omitted hevin any conversashen with the owner aforehand. These okkerd in Noo Gersy, and the owner uv the property wuz a di rekter in the Kamden &amp; Amboy, wich is the only okashuns wher steelin is punisht in that Stait. But 2 resoom: The parable uv the oxen applize 2 the Dimokrasy with grate force. Like them, we hev faced about, and air pullin aginst eech uther. Ez neer ez I kin estimait it, the Dimekratik boddy pollytik contanes eight distink elemence, to-wit: 1. Them ez would nominait Micklellan on a war platform. 2. Them ez would nominait Micklellan on a peese platform. 3. Them as wood nominait Vallandigum on a peese platform. 4. Them ez wood nominait Vallandigum on a war platform. 5. Them ez wood favor the war ef slaivry cood be let alone. 6. Them ez air oppozd to the war in enny shape. 7. Them ez is in Canady, in consekens uv drafts. 8. The betwixt and betweeners, who air ashamd uv our party, and aint sootable for any uther. They air with Dimokrasy ez the Michigander is with his itch—wood like 2 git rid uv it, but can't. These classis is pullin and haulin agin eech uther, and instid uv makin hed agin the common inemy, we air frittrin away our strength and time, a settlin among ourselves as 2 wat we bleeve. This is loonacy unekeld. Troo, we hev been unfortnit in our political speculashens. We made divers and sundry ishoos, and hev bin beat on all uv em. We prophside concernin the strength uv the Sowth, the wuthlesnis uv paper munny, the immigrashen uv niggers, gineral rooin, et settry; but, alas! they awl faild. It wuz up-hill biznis yellin “Nigger!” “Nigger!” wen ther wuz no nigger; it wuz hoomiliatin 2 talk 2 hours a convinsin peeple uv the wuthlesnis uv guvment munny, and then see a Dimekrat sell a hoss, and rite under yer nose refoose to taik any thing but greenbax for pay. It wuz desprit hard work 2 talk uv ginral ruin, wen every body hed a pockitful uv munny, wich munny wood pay dets. These failyoors shood teech us wisdum. We shood decide fust upon what to bleeve, and then we must all bleeve it, and go to work to inockelate the peeple. It maiks nary diffrense to me wat creed we adopt; ez a Dimekrat, I kin go eny wun uv the 8. Wat we want is votes; and wat diffrense duz it maik whether we git em by goin strate or by weevin a trifle. Ther air menny rodes to the post-orifises, but ef we divide up and skatter our forsis over all uv em, we shel be beet in detale. We hev evry reeson to be encuridgd.

      <field name="fulltext">XLVIII. AGAIN REPUDIATES M'CLELLAN, AND GIVES REASONS THEREFOR. Church uv the Noo Dispensashun, } February the 29th, 1864. The ijeotic ijee uv nominatin Micklellan apperes to be gainin ground among the Dimokrasy. Whenever a party gits a goin down hill, it seems ez ef dubble-distild loonacy invariaribly taiks holt uv the engineers, instid uv the cool, cam wisdom nessary to histe it back into assendensy. I obgect to the nominashen uv Micklellan for these reezns: 1st [and 4most.] We can't win with him. Who 's a goin 2 vote for him? The old hard-heded Peese Men, who objeks to drafts, won't, becoz, wile he wuz in command he laid, in the swamps uv the Chickyhominy, the foundashen for a purty hevy draft; besides, he is still drawin pay ez a ginral in this unholy croosaid. The War Dimekrats won't, coz, ez a orfiser operatin agin the Sowth, he wuz not eggsactly a Napoleon. Indeed, a aggreeved frend uv mine frum Gorgy likend him unto a kickin shot-gun—dangerus only to them ez held it. He has n't the elemence uv success in him, ez I kin see. He wuz n't born uv poor but onist parence; he never druv horses on the kanal; he dident study rithmetic by the fire in a log-cabin; neether did he walk bairfoot, in the ded uv winter, 13 miles, to beg a Congrisman to git him in2 West Pint. There 's no precedent for his nominashen. My 2d reeson is: 2d. Ef electid, he woodent be uv eny yoose to me and sich ez I am. Let enny Dimekrat who hez bin waitin for offis 4 weery yeres, look at this. Who is his frends— his neerest? Wy, Fitsjon Porter and that clan. I wuz a thinkin uv it over, and I bleeve it 'll do ez a rool, that the court-marsheld and dismist orfisers air all Micklellan men; and, wen I kum to think uv it, I never knew a deserter that wuz n't. Uv coarse he 'd hev to pervide for em, and wher'd be our chanse? Wy, ther 's enuff uv these to fill all the orfises, frum Secertary uv Stait down to the umblest post-orifis. Agin: Spozn that, ez soon ez he 's electid, he shood conclood not to hev peese, and shood undertaik to finish the war hisself. It wood be jest like him, coz he reely hez a ijee that he 's a gineral. Then the sponsibility uv his doins wood rest with the Dimokrasy, wich Hevin forbid. To think uv us bein sponsible for a Peninsooler campane! Uv coarse, the Dimokrasy wood then hev to volunteer. Think uv his leevin a hundred and 20 thousend ded Dimekrats atwixt Washinton and Richmond! He wuz all well enuff wen the men to be left with ther toes up wuz Ablishnists. It wood be sooiside on an onparalleld scale to trust him with that menny Dimekrats. Agin I say, Hevin forbid! We want a peese man. There 's no room fer us ennywheres else; neether kin we face 2 ways. I wunst attendid a serkus, and beheld with astonishment the trooly grate feets uv hossmanship and sich. Wun rider, who wuz also the moral and instructive injy-rubber man, wuz intoxicatid, and conseetid he cood ride 2 hosses, eech goin a diffrent way. Tyin his feet to the spiritid steeds, he startid em; but, alars! in a second he wuz ript in 2 peeses, and the arena wuz drencht with his goar. Let us taik warnin by his sad fait. Our hoss is not a war-hoss—his naim is Peese, and we must hev a man upon whose garmence ther is no smell uv blood. The gentle Brite, the grate Vallandigum, the akoot Fernandywood, the elegant Samcox, enny wun uv that pecoolyer stripe will do us, and give us ground to go on. Petroleum V.

Robbert Tooms Punt, who hez bin a studyin for the ministry with me for the past 4 weeks, wuz licenst and ordaind. He is a yooth uv much promise. He votid twict for Bookannon, and only 18 yeres old, swarin his votes in with a coolnis and eese that eggscitid the admirashen uv the patriarks at the biznis. I kin safely say that he hez whald moar Ablishnists, bustid moar Methodist, Brethrin, and uther hetrodox Churches, than any Dimekrat uv his age in the Stait. He hez a brilyunt fucher. After the usual qwestions wuz put 2 him, and satisfactroly ansered, the congregashen wuz dismist, and, in the presents uv the elders and dekuns alone, I delivered the follerin CHARGE. Brother—Hevin bin reglerly ordained, it only remanes for me to giv yoo a word uv council. Yoo air a goin in2 the apossel biznis at a rayther unfavrable time. Man, wich is born uv woman, hez trubble for his inheritance. I 've hed so much uv it that, ef I hed it to do over agin, I woodent be born at all. The politikle hevins is orecast with poretenshus clowds. The litenin uv wrath is leapin frum wun to anuther, wilst the thunder, wich wuz wunst at a distance, now rores angrily in our ears. (Grafic ritin.) The ole ship Dimokrasy is tossin madly onto the wild waivs, with nary a sale set, her seams open, the water (a furrin element to her insides) a rushin in. The stiddiest part uv her crew hev seezd the botes and abandoned her, and the rest uv em air a fitin for the helm. In the mean time the ole ship is dashin past the haven uv Success, and is hedin strate for the rox uv Destrucshen. To yoo is intrusted a part uv the work uv savin her. Let me entreet yoo— 1. Avoid the soljers. With them yoo hev nothin in common. They will despitefully use yoo. Wunst a party uv em made me drink a pint uv water and taik the oath uv allejinse, wich outragis wuz follerd by conjestion uv the bowils and inflamashen uv the brane. 2. Alluz preech agin the nigger. It 's soothin to a ginooine, constooshnel, Suthern-rites Dimekrat to be constantly told that ther is a race uv men meaner than he is. Besides, it 's safe — the nigger hez no vote. Ef he hed, we might vary. 3. Alluz hev a marter. The Stait-rites Dimokrasy alluz simpathyze with a man that 's in basteels for simpathisin with the Sowth, for nun uv em know how soon their turn may kum. 4. Preech agin amalgamashen at leest 4 Sundays per munth. A man uv straw that yoo set up yerself is the eesiest nockt down, pertikelerly if yoo set him up with a view uv nockin uv him down. 5. Alluz diloot yoor whisky for new converts. It taiks much to convert a Ablishnist, and ef yoo use the pure artikkle, it wood kill a ordnary constooshn 12 afore he 'd hev time to vote, wich wood be aggervatin. 6. Sarch the skripters fathefully for sech passagis ez “Cussid be Kanan,” “Servance, obey yoor masters,” and sich. 7. Learn to rede, or at least git the shaip uv the letters so fixt in yoor mind that when yoo qwote frum a book or noosepaper, you will hold it rite side up. Eddicashen hez bin a grate help 2 me. 8. Lern to spell and pronownce Missenegenegenashun. It 's a good word. The grate leadin ijees uv our sekt, wich it is yoor dooty to inkulkait, is these: The nigger 's a ape, Linkin a goriller, Jeff Davis a chrischen gentleman, the rebellyun a struggle for rites, the soljer a bluddy tool, Benbutler a beest, et settry. Yoo air never 2 bleeve in Fedral victrys, but must alluz credit Confedrit successes. I woodent advise yoo to let yoor faith in the Confedrisy go so fur as to taik their skrip on yer salary, neether wood I burn greenbax. I hev dun. Go, my brother. Let yer polar star be Dimokrasy, yer rallyin cry, “The Yoonyun ez it wuz—the Constooshn ez it is,” wich is latitoodinus; fite the good fite, and the day will cum wen yoo kin lay orf yer armor, and with “P.

I ther4 direct that the follerin sam shel be chantid in evry church on the last Sundy in May: A SAM UV PRAZE! I wuz cast down and trodded under foot. Becoz the wicked wuz exalted, and the saints wuz umbled. Becoz the peeple worshipt Linkin and spat upon Vallandigum; becoz they trustid Chais, and woodent hev nuthin to do with Fernandywood at no price. Becoz the hosts uv Linkin pervaled over the hosts uv Jeff. There4 my mind wuz trubbled and my sole wuz constipatid. And I cast ashes upon my hed, and bewalid, sayin: Wo is me. Linkin will agin sit in high places—him and his servance—and we shel hunt our holes. Ther shel be uv apintments and places uv profit a thowsand and ten-skore, but for us nary wun. Our enemies shel hev post-orifises and shel be clothed in goodly raiment, while we shel hev to dig or beg. Our food shel be sorrer, and our whisky shel be made week with our own teers. Thus weptid we. But our sorrer wuz turnd to goy and our wailins to gladnis. For Forrest hath smoted the niggers at Fort Pillow, and spared not one. [Hunky.] And Dick Taylor hez whipt Banks at Red River. [Hunky.] And Hoke hez tooken Plymuth, and slayd the defenders thereof. [Hunky.] And Lee, him who aforetime spiled Micklellan, and Burnside, and Hooker, shel chaw up Grant; yea, he will bust him. And he shel taik Washinton; and Linkin, and Chais, and Seward shel be hung upon a gallus forty kubits. Then shel the fatheful hev ther rewards, and be happy for keeps. For niggers shel be plenty, and evry wun shel hev uv them men-servance and made-servance, and home-made servance, and conkebines. And the rivers shel be whisky, and the banks thereof sugar, and the fatheful shel drink their fill. And I shel borrer no more; for, lo! I shel revel upon the spoils uv the Abolish. And my noze shel shine ez the fire, and my face shel glisten with fatnis. Sing a new song, O my peeple, for uv lait did ye sing small!

Lift up yer voices mournfly, O my peeple! Howl, O ye saints! howl like unto the hungry wolf, and the disapinted jackal. Cry out like wun who hath a grate pane—like him who suffreth with belly-ake. Cast ashes upon yer hed, O Fernandywood, and clothe yerself in sack-cloth. Hev anuther coleckshun taken up, O Vallandigum, and pay yer board a yere or 2 in advanse, for yer exel is lengthend. Weep and wale, and nash yer teeth, O Dimokrasy, for yoo hev bin measured, and yer coffin ordered, and the day uv yer funeral apinted; and, lo! the corpse will be reddy. For the biter hez bin bit; yea, the strong man hez bin overkum. Grant, who wuz to hev bin whipt, wuz not whipt; on the contrary, quite the reverse. And Lee, him we sot our harts upon, hez bin beeten, and grate hez bin the slawter uv his host. And Beest Butler will take Richmond, and will not be hangd, ez we prayd. And the Confedracy will be strangled, and Linkin will be President, and the offisis will be lost to us forever and forever. Uv wat avale to us wuz Fort Piller, or Plymuth, or Red River? Lo! they were but fleabites on the back uv a giant. For in Verginny hev we bin chawd up, egrejisly. And our week-kneed wuns, them ez wantid peece last month, hev bekum blud-thirsty, and hooroar for Linkin. Wale, ye saints! For we hev chained ourselves to a corpse, and the corpse stinketh.

Honey hez cum out uv a karkis—good hez perceeded frum Nazzyreth. The Raddykels hev nominated Fremont! Halleloogy! They did it at Cleveland. I never votid for Fremont. In '56 I did n't like—in fact, I aboosed him. I laft at him for partin his hare in the middle; I accoosed him uv being a Cathlic, and uv steelin cattle frum the guverment. Wen Linkin appinted him genral, I aboosed him agin, and more than ever wen he ishood his Emansipashen Proclamashen. But now I diskiver that I hev did him a grevous wrong. The most bekomin way a man kin part his hare is in the middle; the steelin uv cattle frum guverment is a act that no man who supported Bookannon can condemn, and his Abolishnism—why, he 's to be pitied for that. Uv coarse no Dimekrat can vote for him, for ther is a triflin difference in our principples; yet about a haff uv the Abolishn party ought to do it by all means. John C. is the man for them, ondoubtedly. But wether he gits menny votes or few, his bein nominated is salvashen to us. Every vote he gits Linkin won't git, and then what— The bair thot almost overpowers me. We kin elect a Dimekrat! This movement puts a new face upon affairs. We need n't be pertikelerly anxshus enny moar for Lee's success; in fact, I bleeve it wood be better for us 2 hev Grant whip Lee and taik Richmond. For why? Becoz. Spozn about the time the Confederasy is playd out we elect a Dimekrat, and spozn that Dimekrat lets up on em, restoars ther niggers, pardons em, pays ther debts, compensaits them ez hez sustaned losses in the war, and penshens ther widders, woodent they let us hev the heft uv the orfisis awhile?

It 's our last and only hope, and ef the Shecago Convenshun do n't adopt it, the members thereof will prove themselves ijeots. Look at it wunst: 1. Marterdom is a essenshel to candidacy in our party. Who, I ask, is carryin a hevyer lode uv this artikle than these 2 grate marters? Fremont eggsild to Noo York, and Vallandigum a pinin on a furrin shoar! Wat subjex for the illustraitid noosepapers! 2. A variety uv principple is nessary, and this tikkit fills the bill in that pertikeler. Wat a range uv ijee! The largest and best selectid assortment uv principples in the markit! The fiery Ablishnist, the bleever in Onezimus and Hayger, the sympathizer with the Sowth, and them ez yelled for exsterminashun can be served at this shop, and can all be satisfied. 3. We 've got to do it. We 've expended much munny a gettin Fremont out, and in doin uv it hev endorst and adoptid uv him. Spozn we let him run, and nominait sumbody else—wat then? We 've said so much in his favor—we 've labord so hard at provin that Linkin aboozd him, that we won't be able to git it out uv our peeple by eleckshun time, and haff uv em will vote for him. The Dimekratik intellek is limitid — it can't hold 2 ijees to wunst, without gittin uv em mixt. 4. It is essenshal, in a pekoonyary pint uv vew, that we fasten the Ablishnists, for they hev munny, and kin bare the expensis uv the campane, wich is hunky. Fremont hisself hez the Marryposy gold-mines. 5. We kin do it and be consistent. Compermise hez alluz bin a bam for Dimekratik wounds, and we must compermise—each faction sofnin down a little. The Ablishnists must give up ther Ablishnism, the pro-slavery men ther proslaveryism, the war men must give up ther war, and the peece men ther peece, and all yoonite on the brod and comperhensive platform uv opposishen 2 Linkin, on akount uv HIS CORUPTNIS! The fact that we wunst opposd Fremont for the saim reezn, don't matter. I 'd ez soon accept a post-offis at the hands uv Fremont ez enny uther man. I went out into the woods, last Sunday, to see wether I cood holler “Hooror for Fremont!” The fust 15 or 20 times it stuck in my throte, but after a hour or 2, it workt smooth. Dimokrasy is flexyble.

Can't yoo see that the peeple wood cry hozanner 2 us for bringin about a peese, and woodent we carry the eleckshun on that? O, no! not enny! Yoo know wat wood foller yoor return. The Dimokrasy uv to-day is the saim ez they wuz under Peerse and Bookannon. The Ethiop can not change his skin, ner the lepperd his spots, and Noo Gersey is Noo Gersey still. Our kneez are in good workin order, and our bax is limber. We are a mule, saddled and bridled—mount and ride. To rool is yoor normal condishn—to serve is ourn.

Hed he stayd, a poor exel on a furrin shoar, a strainin uv his ize to git even a faint glimpse uv his nativ land, until the campane wuz ?ds over, and then committed sooiside jest afore eleckshun, in a fit uv temprary insanity brot on by greef, and sorrer, and wo, and sich, it wood hev bin hunky. His funeral wood hev bin profitable 2 us, for he is like the jentle hog, a hevy expense to his owner wile livin, and uv no earthly profit 2 him till he dies. Agin. Ther 's no call for takin up coleckshuns, enny more, for his benefit, and—away goze the cheef inkum not only uv myself, but uv haff uv the Dimokratik politishns uv the Stait. I shel hev 2 deny myself uv all luxooris frum this time out. Wat kin we do with him? He heznt the nack uv sayin 2 things at wun say, and nuthin else will do us. Wen the party was a settin its face mildly aginst slaivry, to fool the Free-silers, he wuz for eraddykatin the evil. Now, wen we air pintin mildly Southward, he 's declarin for em openly, in his usual loonattik stile. 2 konklood. I luv Vallandigum; but ef Linkin wood arrest him and immure him in the darkest dunjun in Fort Warin, or hang him, or marter him in enny manner, he wood trooly confer a faver on the undersined, and the entire Dimekratik party. Then wood we carry his deceest karkis thro the North, with suthin to show on our chargis uv tiranny. But with Vallandigum at liberty and in good helth, the fust, last, and only victim uv unconstooshnel usurpashen air gone, and with it our cappytal. Petroleum V.

      <field name="fulltext">LVII. DEFINES HIS POSITION, AND APPEALS FOR AID. Church uv the Noo Dispensashun, } July the 3d, 1864. The Methdist, Presbyterean, Lutheran, and uther hetrodox Churchis, air, to-day, the most hefty obstikkles in the path uv the Dimokrasy; and, to successfully oppose em, I institootid the Church uv the Noo Dispensashun, uv wich I am paster uv sed Church, in charge. Wat the Dimokrasy now want is Church extension: hents this appeal. Dimokrasy is bilt upon the one ijee that the nigger is a babboon. That 's our corner-stun— knock it out, and the entire fabric tumbles. The hetrodox Churches insist that the nigger is human, and that he hez a sole 2 saiv and fit it for the skize. This doctrin, ef it pervales, nox Dimokrasy higher ner a kite. For why? Bekos: ef the nigger's human, and not a beest, wher 's slaivry? Ekko answers, No whair. Bekoz: the commandment sez, “Thow shalt not steel,” et settry. Ef the nigger's a man, we steel wen we taik his laber. Ef he 's a beest, wy, then, we hev dominyun over him, and may use him ez we do the pashent ox. The pint is plane. The Church uv the Noo Dispensashun, uv wich I am paster uv sed Church, in charge, devotes its entire intellek to constrooin the Skripters in akordence with the Dimekratik ijee. Sum uv our brethren, who still hev Methdist and Presbyterin sooperstishuns in2 em, appollygize for their support uv the grate instooshn, by insistin that they bring the Afrikin over 2 this country for the purpis uv chrischenizin uv him. Away with sich nonsents! I 'll nun uv it. Is it chrischenlike 2 ceeze a man in his naytiv land and bring him 2 a furrin shore agin his will? Agin: Ef that 's evangelikle, is it proper 2 maik the forsibly evangelizd heethen work for his bord and wun soot uv cheep cloze, per annum, continooally bein perswadid to renood effort by the cat-o'-nine tales? Ther is grate gane in sich godlinis—at leest 500 per sent. Most ennybody will go in2 the mishnary biznis on them terms. I, week ez I am, kin bare sich a cross. Besides, wen yoo 've got a cargo convertid, why don 't yoo send em back? Dostest thow desire 2 convert their children? O mizable subterfooj! Ef the parience wuz convertid, woodent the children be? Ef that 's yer ijee, what do ye sell em for? Hev yoo took a morgaje onto em for expensis incurd in bringin uv em here, and hev yoo the power uv 4closin? Bosh! (A expreshun uv disgust.) Ef they 're human, they hev a warranty deed for their boddis and soles, the saim ez we hev. Hents, ez slaivry is nessary 2 the Dimekratik party, we must defend it on solid ground. Ther4 my Church, uv wich I am sed paster, in charge, strikes out boldly, and teeches that a nigger is a BABBOON—a beest. Wen wild, he 's enny boddy's property that capchers and tames him; after wich, him and his young is abslootely his, to do with as seemeth good in his site. (Blakstun.) Troo, amalgamashen, wich alluz apperes to be practist wher the instooshn exists, is agin us, for wen a slaiv hez a man for a father, he 's only half babboon. But I never seed enny Dimekratik principple that hed n't a week pint in it. We want munny to establish our Church. We must send mishnaries to Northrin Illinoy, to the Western Reserve, and 2 Massychusitts. It taiks munny for our preechers to live now, for whisky is 10 sents per drink, even in the most obskoor doggrys. Men and brethrin, kum 2 our ade. We hev no lack uv labrers in this grate vin-yard. Evry yere the uther Churchis expel more or less uv their preechers, for irregelaritis in swappin hosses, and for extreme conwiviality and sich, who er willin to be reseevd in2 our buzm. They are reddy; all we want is means to set em aflote. Remittencis uv 10 cents and upwards thankfly reseevd. I 'm President, Secretary, Treasurer, and Bord uv Trusteez uv the Associashen.

I hev made up my mind that the Suthrin Confedrisy is a succeed, and that my fondest hopes is about bein realizd. Troo, the next blast that sweeps frum the Sowth may bring 2 our eers the nooze uv Lee's defeet, but at present writin things is favrable. Wat follers? It 's plane that the Dimokrasy kin never liv in peece with Noo Ingland. We cood endoor it wen we hed the Suthrin Staits 2 balense em at the poles, for wenever wun uv em startid a noosepaper, or went a lectrin out West to spred Noo Ingland ijees, we suspendid the liberty uv the press and uv speech, by hangin the lectrer and smashin the press. Wich is Dimokrasy. The North-west must cut off from the East, with a vew uv jinin the Confedrisy. Uv coarse, them nashen woodent taik us with a debt on our sholders, for they wood hev to repoodiate it; and they air a gentlemanly stile uv peeple, who won't do a dirty thing ef they kin git sumboddy else to do it for em, wich they hev never faled 2 do, sence they bought up us Dimekrats. Hents, they wood reqwire repoodiashen, wich we wood do gladly and willinly, for these reasons, to-wit: 1. It woodent tech menny uv the fatheful, ez them holdin greenbax and guvment bonds air almost excloosivly Ablishnists. Therefour, it wood be a punishin uv our enemies. 2. Ez a rool, the Ablishnists wood leve the country in disgust, wich is benefishl in 2 ways: givin the Dimokrasy clene sweep, and enablin evry indivijjle uv em 2 git wun uv their farms—the only way we 'll ever git em. Then we 'd hev slaivry in the North-west. Eckstatic thot! My hart dilates at the bair ijee! I, Nasby, who hez bin refoozd credit for likker—whose throte hez bin parcht becoz the dime wuz not—who hez bin obleeged to obtane his likker to sustane eggistense by stratejy—Nasby, P. V., will hev a plantashen and—Niggers! Won't I demonstrait the sooperiority uv the Anglo-Sacksun over the Afrikin, by wallopin em! Perhaps not! Won't I hev niggers for carpenters, and blacksmiths, and bricklayers, and sich? Won't we clean out the poor people, and establish a ginooine aristocrisy—ownin laber, instid uv hirin it? Won't we, the sooperior class, dodge the cuss uv laber—fillin our quota uv sed cuss by puttin in nigger substitoots? Won't I spend my days a suckin cocktales and my nites at poker, sellin a family evry now and then to keep up financis? Them 's happinis condenst—them 's my ijees uv a terresterial paradise. Hasten thy work, O Lee! Maik thyself strong, O Boregard! Be wise and bold, O Jonson! Go forrerd in yer nigger-killin, O Forist! and O, Davis!

      <field name="fulltext">LIX. SHOWS THAT A WAR PLATFORM WON'T DO FOR THE DEMOCRACY. Church uv the Noo Dispensashun, } July the 17th, 1864. It is probable, yes, I may say, tolable sertin, that P. V. Nasby, wich is preecher uv sed Church, in charge, may retire frum publik life shortly. Why? methinks I heer the entire Dimekratik party, who hev long regarded me as a ornament 2 my secks, and the wun altogether luvly, exclame. The why is plane to a massive intellek, wich is me—the good old Dimekratik party is on the strate rode to destruction, and, to yoose a raleroad mettyfor, onless it is switcht orf at Shecago, it 's a goner, and the more it succeeds at the November eleckshun, the wus is its goneniss! “Singler!” exclames a patriotic and self-sacrificin Dimekrat, who hez a post-orifis in his beemin eye—“singler that success shood rooin us. Wy, that 's wat we 're goin for.” Jently, my frend. Uv wat avale is it to elect a President in sich a way ez 2 make it morally sertin to be defeetid ever after? Troo, we 'd hev the post-orfisis; but, with a Ablishn Congris to watch us, wher 'd be the chancis uv steelin, nessary to our support? To eloocydait. The Dimokrasy hev postponed their convenshun till it is assertaned how Lee vs. Grant cums out. Ef Lee whales Grant—peece platform. Ef Grant whales Lee—war platform. Now the chancis air that Lee will be whipt, for the tyrent Linkin hez a spite at that grate and good man. Then we 're a war party, and go into the campane on the corruptnis uv the Administrashen, and beet em, and git the post-orifises. Wat then? Wy this. The war is OUR war; the taxis is OUR taxis; the drafts is OUR drafts, and WE wood hev the responsibility instid uv our enemis. Ez a matter uv coarse, Dimekrats wood hev to do the volunteerin, for it wood be their war, and the armies wood hev to be led by Dimekratik ginerals. Good hevins! Immagin 500,000 Dimekrats under sich ez Micklellan and Booel! Wat a redoosin uv magoritis—wat a waste uv votin stock ther wood be! The troo polisy for us is peese. Ez a peese party, we are certin uv gettin the support uv these classis, to-wit: The stingy cusses, who obgect to payin taxis. The cowerdly cusses, who air afrade uv bein draftid. Every draft and every new tax jest more 'n adds to our ranks; so fast, indeed, that ef we cood stop the Methodist, Presbyterian, Lutheran, etc., revivals uv religun, and git whisky back to old prices, so that we cood afford to use it profoosely, we cood be in good shaip next fall. By bein a war party we lose all these people, and taik them out; and, in the name of hevin, wat wood be left uv us! Peese is our best and only holt, and, onless the party taik that dodge, I shel retire, for we can't win but wunst on war, and then the responsibilities we 'd hev to assoom wood be 2 much for us. The Dimekratik intellek is not hefty. Ez for myself, I 've no feers—I kin git along. There 's small groseries to be run; and the retailin uv likker in a striktly Dimekratik community, where they 'd work jest twelve hours — earnin enuff to carry em thro the uther 12 at my bar— has alluz appered to me to be the highth uv earthly bliss.

Sumhow, it is in our Church ez it is in the hetrodox—we air hot and cold alternitly. Last Sundy we hed a preshus seezn. Brother Siples spoak. He confest that he wuz a week mortal. He hed his ups and downs, bad. It wuz ruff on him. Wenever Grant and Sherman hed a success, his faith faled him; and sumtimes he hed difficulty in cumin to time even wen Lee whipt Grant. But he hed resently paid ?2 per gallon for whisky, and that stird him. With wun hand upon his 2 often empty jug, and tother pinted to heven, he hed sworn eternal hostility to them ez hed razed these prices, wich is Ablishnists. If convenyent, he askt the brethring to pray for him. Brother Hopp riz. He hed his ups and downs also—rayther more downs than ups. His sole wuz full wen Forrist killed the niggers; but, alas! wo wuz on him wen Sherman flaxt em at Atlanta. 14 Now the skize is brite. Lee holds out bully, and tother day 4,000 niggers wuz kild at Petersburg. At this pint I interruptid Brother Hopp. The killin uv niggers is no coz uv rejoisin. Wat a destrucshen uv property! 4,000 niggers at ?1,500 per nigger, is ?6,000,000! This sum uv munny, even at the present Ablishn prices, wood prodoose 60,000,000 nips! Wood, O, wood that I wuz condemd 2 consoom em all! Ef them niggers hed bin white men, I woodent hev keered. Wy? Bekoz, white soljers is all Ablishnists. Do n't shake yer hed, Brother Gamp; it 's so. Yoor own son, even, backslid. He it wuz who writ hum, a sayin that if he cum back and found that ole hipocrit, Nasby, a eetin chickings about yoor house, he 'd plump a ounce ball into him. Hipocrit! Chickings! Sich baseniss confirms me in my beleef in the doctrin uv totle depravity. I am no obtroosiv gest at the tables uv my flock. Troo, I ete; but wood eny uv em say that chickings wuz a equivalent for my improvin conversashen? Ez for the paltry munny I borrer, I alluz giv my note, wich settles them transactions. 2 resoom. Every nigger killed inflaims our brethrin powrful. Immagin, my brethrin, a Suthern artilrist a bringin uv his peece to bare upon the advansin enemy. He sees they are niggers, and his hart sinks. Neerer and neerer they cum. Seezin a glass, he vews em, and, horrer! in the front rank, “clothd in soots uv bloo,” he beholds his indivijjle niggers! Neerer! neerer! Fain wood he spare em, for them very niggers may be the uncles uv a half dozen uv his children, (wich is patriarkle,) to say nuthin uv the munny he hez inwestid in em. But no! The order is given! “Fire!” He pulls the fatal string, and ez he beholds his own property a bleedin on the plain, he swoons away. My jentle frends, I make no dout that haff the cases reportid in the Suthrin papers ez sun-stroak, wuz frum this coz. Uther brethrin giv their experence in. The feelin is improvin sence the draft, and I hev faith that ef our groseries kin hold up till September 5, under the credit system, and too menny don't run 2 Canady, we will be able to whale eny Provo Marshell's forse they kin send agin us.

      <field name="fulltext">LXI. STARTS A SOCIETY OF HIS OWN. Church uv the Noo Dispensashun, } August the 3d, 1864. I am no “Son uv Liberty.” Enny Dimekrat who can't stan a hevyer dose than that instooshn affords, ain't fit to hev the electiv franchise exercised for him. I hev instootid a order uv my own, wich is more adaptid 2 the Dimekratik intellek at large—suthin that they kin understand. Wat 's the yoose, I ask indignantly, uv tellin our deciples that free speech is dun away with by Linkin, wen we are openly blattin Suthrin rites on evry cross rodes, without enny mentle reservation watsoever? Wat's the yoose uv talkin 2 Dimekrats about habis corpusses, wen haff uv em never had em, and tother haff woodent hev knode the yoose uv em if they'd a had em? Nonsents! My order, wich I call the “Anshent and Sublime Order uv Putty-backs,” hez suthin in it they kin understand. The follerin is a part uv the ritooel: The candydate is brot into the anty-room, (so cald frum the fact that he there anties up his inishashen fee,) blind-folded. He 's frightend. A bottle is applide 2 his nose, wich reassures him, for well he nose wher ther 's whisky ther 's Dimokrasy. The follerin dialogue ensoose: Queshun. Air you a Dimekrat? Q. Do yoo considder yoorself better than a nigger? Q. Air yoo afeerd yoor sister will marry a nigger, and do you want the Lejislacher uv yer various Stait 2 maik laws a preventin uv her? Do yoo bleeve that a Ablishnist luvs a nigger better'n himself, his wife and children, his unkles and ants, and sich? Do yoo bleeve that this war, conseevd by John Brown and innoggeratid by A. Linkin, is bein carrid on by Ablishnists for the sole purpus uv freein the niggers and bringin uv em North, and elevatin uv em a inch or 2, so ez to git em over Dimekrats? Do yoo bleeve that at Oberlin they feed nigger students on oysters and briled porter-house steak, and the whites on hash? Do yoo bleeve there air 800,000 niggers in the North now, and that the guvment intends 2 hev em all vote this fall? Air yoo willin 2 taik up arms agin this elevashen uv the nigger? Will yoo solumly plej yoorself 2 vote the Dimekratik tickit without a skratch, and to rally promptly to the killin uv Provo Marshels? The candidait, uv coarse, ansers all these quesshuns in the affirmative, after wich sum wun is huntid up who kin rite his naim, to wich he maiks his mark, and he 's inishatid. My sosiety is pekoolyerly adaptid to the party, coz it 's strong uv nigger, wich all uv em kin understand. I never knowd a ginooine Suthern-rite Dimekrat that dident consider the free Afrekin a disgustin obgek, and who ain't continooally strivin 2 maik himself bleeve that sumboddy's lower down than himself. Hents their anxiety to own a nigger, and wher that ain't permitted, their onquenchable desire to kill wun. My ijee is never to lose holt uv the nigger.

      <field name="fulltext">LXII. INDORSES THE NOMINATION. Church uv the Noo Dispensashun, } September the 1st, 1864. Glory! Micklellan, the nashun's pride, is nominatid! Bein a orthodox Dimekrat, the nominashen soots me! Nominashens alluz soots orthodox Dimekrats! In 30 years' experience, I never knew a nominashen that dident. Me and my Church wuz for peese. We wuz for Suthern rites. We wuz opposed to drafts, and had purchast revolvers. Ther4 the incomparible Micklellan wuz not our fust choice. The fact is, the grate George wuz a war man wunst, and wuz the original inventor uv drafts, wich don 't make him ez acceptable to us ez he mite be. But ther 's a excoose for him. The Dimokrasy must bare in mind that the unforchnit man hed sunk sum 85,000 Ablishnists sumwher about Richmond, and ez he knew uv the prejoodis existin agin volunteerin under him, he insistid on hevin uv em brot in by draft. It was all dun for the benefit uv the Dimokrasy, becoz: The Dimekrats drafted wood resist or run to Kanady—the Ablishnists wood go, and, halleloogy! but few uv em wood ever return. On receet uv the news I immejitly called my flock together, announst it to em, and giv em the follerin breef biographical sketch uv our candidate, ez follows: George B. Micklellan wus born uv rich but honist parence, sumwher, in the yeer 18—. (I luv accoorasy.) The nationality uv his parence I am not shoor uv, but from the fact that all the bitter old Kno-Nothins is a supportin him, I shood think he wuz uv Irish extraction. His great pint was promptnis and decision uv karicter, and these quality displayed itself at a erly period. It is on rekord in the arkives uv the family, that he cried immejitly after he wuz borned, and commenst nursin within a hour. He wuz remarkable at skool for the same quality. No sooner did the clock strike noon, than young George wood promptly leeve the house. The fucher general wuz foreshaddered in the skill with wich he robbed melon patches. He made reglar approaches, wich were skillful, but his retreets wuz magnifisent. He cood change his base bootiful—shiftin from melon patchis to orchards with neetnis and dispatch. Another peekooliarity uv young George shows how troo is the sayin, that “The child is father uv the man.” Wile George cood alluz very elaboritly stratejise hisself int2 a melon patch or orchard, he never stratejised hisself out with any melons or apples. He wuz edikatid at West Pint, and wuz finally made President uv the Ohio and Mississippy Rale-rode. Here his decishun agin showd itself. He conseeved the bold ijee uv gravelin the road, wun mornin, at 31 minutes past 11. Wun yeer frum that time he announst to the Drektors that 17 labrers and an ekal number uv wheelbarrers hed bin prokoored, and he wuz bizzy, at that time, perfectin a plan for organizin uv em. 2 months after he announst his plan perfected, and that operations hed commenst on a gravel-pit. 4 days uv brilyantly successful work follered, wen he announst that he wuz obleegd to suspend operations, that 5 wheelbarrers wuz broke, and 7 labrers hed the diarrear. He wood reorganize promptly, and proceed. Reorganizin this forse, and perfectin a new plan uv approach, only okepied 8 months, and the work wood hev bin commenst by this time, had not the war broke out. The pay uv the Fedral Guvment bein larger and more surer than the Confedrasy, he relinquisht ralerodin and entered the Fedral serviss. His military career is knowd by all on us. Suffice it 2 say, that no general wuz ever so beluvd South, and so hated North, wich wuz wat prokoord his nominashen. Sich, my brethrin, is our candidate. Let us all sink our prejoodisis, and elect him. The platform on wich he stands I endorse with my whole hart. I hevent read it yet, but it must be good, for Vallandigum made it. The post-orfises, the treasury, for wich we hev bin waitin 4 long, dreery yeres, is within our reech. Let us, my brethrin, go in and win. The cheerin for me will now commense. A collekshun wuz taken up to defray expensis uv the campane. ?8 wuz reelizd, wich wuz paid over to me. I shel probably appere on the stump in a new pair uv pants. Petroleum V.

The nominashens uv the Shecago Convenshun is made, and altho they do n't soot me, I shall support em. Post-orfises can't be attained by us, thro Linkin—Micklellan is the way, and as a Dimekratik profit I remark, “Walk ye in it.” But I 'm hevin a time with my flock. Ther 's more uv a diversity uv opinion than ever I saw among Dimekrats afore, and I 'm afeered that my jigantik intellek ain't hefty enuff to reconsile the diffrenses. I called a meetin last nite, in the hopes uv settlin matters and restorin harmony. I took the cheer, and made a few elokent remarks. Brothers Siples, Spot, Hopp, and Gamp, who hev faith to bleeve they 'll respectivly hold the orfises uv assessor, collekter, postmaster, and provo marshel, on the strength uv remarks I made to em, wer enthoozyastik for Micklellan. They bleevd him to be the Dimekratik Messiah, razd up expressly to save the instooshn. They shood give him a harty, corjel support. Brother Punt, who boards me on tick, and who furnishes me likker on the same terms, wich is ez good ez I cood wish, and who expex payment wen I git a orfis, wuz enthoozyastiker for Micklellan than any uv us. He wuz supprizd at the apathy that pervaled, wen so much wuz at stake. He perpozd 3 cheers for Micklellan. Brothers Siples, Spot, Gamp, Hopp, Punt, and myself cheerd with the wildest enthoozyasm. At this pint Brother Guttle ariz. He hed heerd nonsents enuff. He wuz under 45, and wuz able-boddid. Consekently he jined the Sons uv Liberty, and bot a revolver, and had his rifle fixt. Wat wuz 2 be dun with them tools? Wuz he to hev no oppertoonity to yoose em? Wat he wantid to know, wuz Micklellan peese or war? Ef he wuz peese, all rite. He 'd as soon shoot provo marshels under his banner, ez eny body's, but bein a peese man, he must shoot sumboddy. He hed a neighbor read the platform to him day before yisterday. He must say he wuz dizgusted. We are peese. We bleeve in State rites, in immejit recognishun uv Suthern independense, and wuz opposed to coershun. To all uv wich he hed sworn. He did n't go much on oaths, but wen a oath sootid him he 'd keep it. Why did n't the convenshun say peese? Ef he hed got to be dragd in2 the army like a peese lamb to the slawter, he 'd ez soon let Linkin drag him ez Micklellan. It wuz the draggin in2 the feeld that he obgektid 2—not the man who draggd him. He wantid to know, he did. I replied 2 this misguidid man. I assoomd that magestic, lofty, penetratin gase, wich only 2 men in Ameriky possest—me and D. Webster. I told him that obejense wuz the fust principple uv Dimokrasy. The convenshun—OUR convenshun, hed nominatid—all we hed to do wuz 2 vote. Ef the convenshun hed saw fit to nominate a war man, on a war platform, it wood hev bin our dooty 2 hev votid it; but the convenshun wuz not hard on us. It accommodated us all. Air yoo a War Dimekrat? Was n't Micklellan a gineral? Is n't he the inventer uv drafts? Did n't he arrest the Maryland Lejislacher? Air yoo a peese man? Did n't the magestik Micklellan endorse Gudge Woodward? Did n't he take the nominashen at the hands uv Vallandigum? Air yoo a Suthern man? Ask any Suthern gineral who he 'd ruther see at the hed uv our armies, and he 'd anser, in thunder tones, Micklellan! Then the platform. Is ther any thing in it agin war? Is ther any thing in it agin peese? It is a accommodatin platform, halleloogy! Brother Hopp, who is a thirstin after human gore, can slake his thirst at this fountin. To Brother Guttle, who wuz a peese man, this platform wuz the white-winged angel herself. I hev n't eggsamined it critikally, but I hev n't the slightest dout that the doctrine uv four ordinashen, or totle depravity, or elekshun, or free-grace, kin be proved from it concloosively. It 's a broad platform. Ther wuz room on it for Fernandywood and Sam Cox, for Vallandigum and Seemore—the pyramid built on sed platform has room on the apex for Micklellan with his gory sword, and Pendleton with his olive-branch, halleloogy! Brother Guttle wuz reprimanded. I hev n't any dout that my Church will be a unit in support uv the nominashens.

Sampson hed his hair shingled and wuz week as waterd whisky, but it growd agin, and he busted his enemies! We hev biles and are rotten with em, but where 's the comfortin oyster-shell? We hev leprussy, but where 's the Jordan to jump into? Our hair is short, and thar's whar our enemies hev got us, but whar 's the restorative to make it grow agin? Job, and Naman, and Sampson, altogether, wuz n't as bad off ez we is. We kin throw in Lazzyrus with his sores, and the dorgs a lickin uv em, and then give em 50 in a 100 and beat em. For we nominatid Micklellan and Pendleton, at Shecago, and wun is a war man and tother is a peese man. The ox and the ass is yoked—their heads and tails together. And the teem is pullin viggerusly, but instid uv goin forerd, it 's goin round and round. Wale! O my peeple, for the ticket wuz n't war enuff, and Cass hez bolted! Gnash yer teeth! O ye saints, for the tickit wuz n't peese enuff, and Vallandigum hez bolted! We tried 2 ride two hosses, goin in 2 diffrent direckshuns, and we fell to the ground. And both hosses turned on us and kicked us. And Micklellan hez no chance—he won't hev the givin uv the post-offises. Wah!* * In korius—all 2gether. And Sherman took Atlanta, and chawd up Hood! Wah! And Lee wants the Weldon road, but he can't git it. Wah! And Gov. Morton took the revolvers from the peece men uv Injeany. Wah!

For Maine and Vermont, wich wuz tired uv the war, and wuz a goin for Micklellan, hev voted Ablishn with a loosenis. Wale! For our rulers oppress us. They let their men vote in the army, but won't let our men vote in Canady! Wah! Wale! For the Ablishnists shel hold the orfises, and we shel be numbered among the outs! Wah! Wale! For in the fucher I see no way uv livin but by work! Why wuz I born in2 sich a world! Why wuz whisky created, ef yoo can't git it without a price? Why wuz orfisis establisht, ef them can't git em ez wants em the most? Micklellan buried his thousands in the swamps uv the Chickahominy—he hath buried his tens of thousands under the platform he kicked over!

      <field name="fulltext">15 LXV. DESPONDENT. Church uv the Noo Dispensashun, } September the 23d, 1864. I am trubbled, and my soul is bustin with greef. The irrepressible conflict is onto us; it hez bin transferd from the Ablishnists 2 us, and it 's burnin among us like the onquenchable fire. And wuss; we do n't know how to remedy the evil, coz we 're in a state uv onsartinty—we do n't know how nor where we 're lame. When we got Micklellan nominated, I to wunst exclaimed, “Halleloogy!” Here wuz fatniss! Here wuz a candidate upon whom the entire party cood yoonite. Ef a Dimokrat wuz rather inclined to human gore, we cood pint triumfantly to the fact uv his hevin bin a general. To a peece man we cood say “Pendleton,” and to the Suthern sympathizer, uv whom we hev much, we cood prove that George B. never did the Suthern army wun-tenth the damage he did the Northern, and wuz ez eezy on em ez he cood be under the serkumstancis, and we put him on a platform that wood prove all uv them posishens. A candidate uv sich stretchibility, on a platform so accommodatin, methought ought to please everybody; but sumhow it did n't. Peese men won't go it, becoz it ain't peese enuff; war men won't go it, becoz it ain't war enuff; and the Suthern men won't go it, becoz it do n't recognize Suthern independence. Hentz, all that is supportin Micklellan is them uv our peeple who wants orfis— whose principples is salary and perquisites. The grate Vallandigum kicked out uv the traces, and telegrapht “All is lost!” Alas! how troo! All is indeed lost! Atlanta is gone, Mobeel is goin, and Richmond is follerin soot. Davis and Lee, in ther extremity, hold out ther hands implorinly to the North, and wat response do they git? Nary. We air powerlis. Provo marshels kin arrest deserters at ther will, the draft will be enforst, and Linkin will be electid. Troo, all is lost! The Suthern coz is lost, the post-orfises is lost, the doggerys is lost! I shel emigrate to Canady. There the Dimokrasy are in the majority—there, in that cold, inhospitable clime we kin reorganize the party. It will soot us better. It 's colder there than here, and the system requires a greater quantity uv stimulatin flooids. The niggers we will enslave, and there will we build up a goverment based upon the ijee uv the sooperiority uv the Anglo-Sacksun race. “The stun wich the bilders rejected,” et settry.

I 'm satisfide that Pennsilwany, Ohio, and Injeany hev gone for Ablishn. I seed it in a daily paper. Therefore, I direct that every church in my dyoceese be draped in mournin, (the same we used when we heerd uv Atlanta will anser,) and that the follerin sam uv angish be chantid at every servis, until we git the returns from Noo Gersey. Ohio! Pensilwany! Injeany! Pennsilwany is cussid, Ohio is cusseder, but Injeany is cussidest. Weep, O my people, for lo! the hind sites is knoct off us! Gnash yer teeth, for the staits we counted on the most hev gone the wust agin us. Tare yer hair, for Voorhees is beet. Throw ashes on yer hed, for little sam cox is gone up. Array yerself in shoddy, for we 're all gone up. Ef sich is dun in the green tree, wat will it be in the dry. I am a fountain uv lamentations—they run from me ez doth the water from the springs. Can we look 2 the South for comfort? Nay, verily. For Atlanta is gone, and Lee rageth in vain, and Early is chawd up eggreejusly. And Linkin, and Grant, and Sherman, and Sheridan are laffin with much laffter—they feel good. But their mirth is our wo, their meat is our pizen. Can we look to the North? Not any; for that is a Sahara Desert uv Ablishnism, with nary a oasis. Wher is the post-offisis? Wher is the collekterships, and wher the tother places uv profit? They are not for us. To the East we stretch our hands, and Maine ansers, “'ror for Linkin!” To the West we turn, and Injeany pops it to us to the tune uv 30,000. We bot revolvers in that Stait, and lo! we committid sooicide with em. We are a dove, a peece dove, shoved out uv the political ark. And the deluge uv Ablishnism rageth wildly, and shows no sign uv subsidin. And we air weery, but kin find no place to rest our foot. Bestir thyself, O Lee! if yoo wood save us in November. On yoo we bet our pile; yoo are our anker and our cheefest trust. We preech in vane that the war is a faleyoor, while yoo air bein whipped once or twice per day. Be valiant, for gold is goin down, and goods is goin with it, and the Ablishnists laff and the peeple is content. Whale Grant jist wunst, and give us wun more chanse.

O, wunst I wuz a planter, A reglar F. F. V.; I owned five hundred niggers, Whose work supportid me. O, dident I hump them niggers, And make their sweatin pay? I cat-o-nined the lazy, And worked em night and day. I had a gorjus carriage, Four hosses fleet ez wind, A fat nig on for driver, Two footmen on behind; The hangins they wuz damask, The trimmins rare and rich, Jest ez they do in Europe, Wher they hev lords and sich. I went to Saratogy With flunkies in my train, I spent my cash by thousands, And when at home again, To make up the expenses, I 'd sell off nigs a skore, And to keep up the labor I worked the rest the more. Uv coarse, I went to Congris, Ez all the Lash-lords do; I spent my nites at poker, At seven-up and loo. We bullied dough-faced Yankees, And made em bow the knee, Ez umble ez our niggers, Before the chivalree. At home we huntid niggers, With dorgs and ketchers skilled; Up North Bookannon's marshels The blood-hounds places filled; Our sins, no odds how black they wuz, Did never trubble us, Our Northren friends wood sholder em, And take, themselves, the cuss. But all them days is past and gone; The Yank, at last, hez riz; He won't acknollij enny more That we his master is. My munny Jeff'son D. hez got, My niggers, drest in bloo, Air a fitin us ez owned em, And a whippin uv us too. O wat week worms we mortals is, Who never is content; We hed a good thing, but 2 git A better, let it went. We hed the bone, but let it go, To grab a glitt'ring shadder; We 've lost em both, and since hev gone From mity bad to badder.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LXVIII. HAS A DREAM. Church uv the Noo Dispensashun, } October the 21st, 1864. I am no bleever in gosts or dreems, or sich, nor never wuz. Ef the tyrant Linkin, (wich is a ape,) shood draft me, and I shood be dragged to the tentid feeld, a unwillin marter, I know I shood much prefer meetin the gost uv a rebel soljer, wich is a shadder, than 2 enkounter wun in the flesh, with a muskit and baynet, wich is no shadder. Dreems is likewise unsubstanshel, and result, 9 cases out uv 10, frum aboose uv the stumick. I dreem but seldom, and wen I do, I alluz attribit it 2 eatin a pound or two more sassij, or drinkin a quart or two more whisky, than I reely need, late at nite; and I never bleevd they wuz prophetik, becoz I don't allow that the seat uv prophesy is located in the stumick. These is my theory uv gosts, dreems, and sich. I hed a dreem last nite, wich left a impreshn on my mind. I hed bin preparin a sermon, provin that “Servants, obey yoor masters,” justified the ketchin uv niggers with dorgs, wen I fell asleep and dreemed. Methawt I wuz dead, and hed laid in that stait 200 yeers, and hed awoken, and found myself agin on earth. I saw nothin pekoolyer. There wuz more ralerodes, and more skool-houses, and in2 wun uv the latter I went. The skool-marm wuz eggsaminin a class uv youngsters in histry. “Who wuz the greatist and goodest men the Yoonitid Staits ever prodoost?” “George Washington and Aberham Linkin.” “What did they do?” “Washington foundid the government, and Linkin preservd it.” “Who wuz the wust men the country prodoost?” A little gurl anserd: “Joodath Ithcariot, Benedict Arnold, Jeff Davith and Vallandigum.” “Yoo air wrong, my child,” retortid the skool-marm. “Judas lived in another country, and be4 the others. They were so simler, however, that the errer is excoosible. What did Arnold, and Davis, and Vallandigum do?” “Arnold betrayed his country, and took up arms agin it; Davis rebelled agin his government, and Vallandigum helped him all he cood without gettin hisself into danger.” “What names were given them ez opposed the government, in '76 and '61?” “Tories and Copperheds.” “Which wuz the wust, the Tories or Copperheds?” “That pint hez bin much discust, but no konkloosion hez ever bin arriv at.” “How menny times wuz Linkin electid President?” “Two.” “Had he enny opposition for the sekkund term?” “Nun 2 speek uv. The rebels and Copperheds run a disgracd soljer, whose name sum historyans giv ez Mickfadden, uthers ez Micknellan, and uthers ez Micklellan; but ez he reseevd no votes in the elektoral collij, the eleckshun wuz considderd unanimus. The Copperhed candidate sunk in2 obskoority after the war, and he wuz forgotten, wich wuz lucky for his children.” I notist about haff the childern hed on bloo ribbin; one-fourth wuz drest ordinary, and the balence hed a white rag pinned to ther bax. I asked the skool-marm wat this indikatid. She askt me ef I wuz a furriner; to wich I anserd, I wuz, a furrin prince in disgise, on a tower uv observashen. She replied: “Them ez hez bloo ribbins is the descendants uv the soljers uv the grate rebellion; them with no dekorations is desendid frum loyal men who wuz not soljers; and them poor things who hev the white rag, [she bustid in2 teers and wept perfoosely,] are the unforchnit desendance uv—Copperheds!” I visitid a court-house. The case they wuz tryin wuz slander. One man hed asserted that the great-great-grandfather uv another, who wuz a opposin candidate for Gustis uv the Peese, hed bin a Copperhed. Plaintiff brot into court a old paper printed in 1864, wich showd that sed ancester wuz on a Linkin sentrel komity. Goory brot in a verdick uv ?10,000 for plaintiff. I awoke frum this dreem in a cold swet. “Is it possible,” thot I, “that posterity will so regard us?” and for a minnit I wuz almost persuadid to be a Christian. But I thot uv the post-offisis, and sed 2 myself, “What is posterity to a ded man? Let me hev offis, and the menes uv keepin my skin full uv whisky without work, and posterity may think wot it pleezis.” And I resoomed laber on my sermon. Petroleum V.

      <field name="fulltext">LXIX. LOSES A FRIEND, AND WRITES HIS OBITUARY. Church uv the Noo Dispensashun, } October the 28th, 1864. A piller hez fallen! Last nite, at 10 o'clock and 67 minits P. M., Issaker Punt, a dekun uv my Church, and the heftiest piller in the instooshn, in fact the only one who pade his qwarterige regler, departid this life. Brother Punt wuz born a Dimekrat; he reseeved the faith by inheritance, as his father wuz one afore him. And that faith he kept. He mite hev bin sedoost in2 the by and ferbidden paths uv Whiggery and Ablishnism, and sich, but knoin the frailty uv human nacher, he persistently refoozd to learn 2 reed, and thus made himself sekoor from the wiles uv unscroopulus politishns. It wuz a butiful trate in his karikter that he wood never vote a tikkit that he did not git frum the hands uv a sentral committee-man! Brother Punt commenst his polittikle life a votin for Androo Jaxn, when he wuz but 18 years old. The rigid moralist may obgect to this act, ez illegle. It wuz obgectid 2 at the time, and the youthful hero wuz arrestid and impriznd, and he wood hev remaned in prizn two yeers, hed he not bin pardoned out by a Dimekratik guvner, jest afore the next elekshun. We next find him battlin for Dimokrasy in the person uv Martin Van Booren. At that elekshun he votid twice, and drunk 172 times. Ez he repeetedly remarkt 2 me, that day wuz a tryin one. The first hundred drinks wuz nateral—the balens wuz excess; but he hed pledgd his township for a certain magority, the candidates hed given him the munny 2 treet with, and he wuz determined 2 do it ef it cost him a attack uv delirium treemens. He wuz alluz reddy 2 sacrifice his bowils for the coz. He manijd to survive Harrison's elekshun, and wuz activ in prookoorin Poke's triumph. He mourned doorin Fillmore's rane, and rejoist with eckseedin grate joy doorin Peerse and Bookannon's. In 1860 he did n't vote for nobody. He knode Duglis wuz a Dimekrat, and so wuz Breckenrij. He attendid meetins uv both factions, and hoorayd viggerusly for both, but, unforchnitly, the committy who hed furnisht him tikkits for yeers wuz divided—one-haff for Duglis and tother for Breckinrij. He coodent deside wich wuz the reel Dimekratik tikkit, and so, on elekshun day, he went 2 the poles, and went thro the moshuns uv votin with a peese uv blank paper. But he hed no doubts ez to opposin Linkin—he knode he wuz no Dimekrat, for both committy-men told him so. O, with what goy he heerd the nooze uv the firin on Fort Sumter! With what eckstasy he heerd uv Bull Run! No man in the North exhibbitid more ability in swarin at Linkin—no one cood retail 2 better advantage the lies the sentrel committy desidid to serkelait. Brother Punt growd low-sperited at the battle uv Stone River, and kept failin ez Linkin's dorgs advanst. He britened up a little wen Forist killed the niggers at Fort Piller; but Sheridan and the Injeany eleckshuns prostratid him feerfully, and he becum so redoost that his likker hed 2 be fed 2 him with a spoon. Brother Punt wuz a consistent member uv the Church uv the Noo Dispensashun. Before jinin my flock, it wuz his boast that he hed never bin inside a meetin-house. There4 he rejoist at the oppertoonity uv heerin a pure gospil, in2 wich, ef the nigger wuz interdoost at all, he wuz put in and held up hand-cufft, wich is alluz refreshin to the troo Dimekratik mind. He despisd Ablishn preechin. Brother Punt's Dimokrasy wuz uv a broad, comprehensive karicter. He follered the party. Opposed to Stait's rites and secession under Jaxn, he wuz in favor uv both in 1864. Opposed to slaivry-extension in '48, he favord it in '60, and so on. The immejit coz uv his deth wuz this tyrannikle Administrashen. Whisky hed got so high that he wuz forst 2 diloot it, and at his age he coodent stan it. He died uv water on the stumic. I wuz with him in his last momence. His mind wandered, and he talked uv goin wher he 'd finelly hev a post-orfis. The docter, who wuz a Ablishnist, unfeelinly remarkt, that ef ther wuz mails in the country he wuz goin 2, it wood be nessary to hev fire-proof mail-bags. Like all other grate men, he hed his last words (no member uv my flock shel die without hevin last words, so long ez I kin write)—I writ em yisterdy. They wuz: “Hev we carried Pennsylwany?—my coppers is burnt out!—put on my tomb-stun, “He voted erly and often, and never skratched a tikkit.” Ez winter is approachin, and I need a new soot uv klose, I hev determined to call upon the brethren for funds to erect a sootable monument to the memory uv this sterlin Dimekrat. Sums uv 10 sents (wich, sence Vallandigum's speckelashun, is the orthodox Dimekratik contribushen,) for this purpus, may be sent 2 me, with the asshoorence that it will be faithfully used.

      <field name="fulltext">LXX. ISSUES AN “APPELE.” Church uv the Noo Dispensashun, } October the 31st, 1864. Fello Dimekrats uv the Yoonited Staits: I address yoo! Not speshally in the bowils uv luv, but from the bowils uv necessity; and from them bowils alluz cums the most agonizin cries. Next Toosday is the eventful day wich desides whether the post-orfises is to remane another four yeers in the hands uv the Ablishnists, or whether 16 we, who are literally hungrin and thirstin for em, shel hev em. I appele not only 2 the Dimokrasy, but 2 the people. We hev hed 4 yeers uv onpleasantnis— 2 uv wich, after the grate Micklellan wuz dismist by a corrupt administrashen wuz actooal war. Wat hez bin the result? We hev overrun over the half uv the Dimekratic Staits. We hev slawterd untold thousens uv good Dimekrats, who 'll never rally 2 the poles agin. We hev made it necessary for our Suthern brethren 2 run up a debt wich they kin never pay. We hev bombardid their cities and burned their houses. We hev stole their niggers and made em fite their masters, wich is unscriptooral. A vote for the ape Linkin is a vote to continue all this, until the South lies helpless at his feet, shorn uv her niggers and Dimokrasy, wich is synonimus terms. A vote for Micklellan is altogether another thing. It is a vote for a armistis—a cessashen uv hostilitis until we kin find out what the South want, and also whether the people is in a frame uv mind for givin. Ef they ain't, then the war will be continued, but in such a gentle and brotherly stile, that we will soon be willin to kum 2 sech terms ez they desire. O, my brethrin, imagin us back under the wing uv the Democratic Staits, with Davis and Toombs and Stephens back in the Senit, a releevin uv us uv all the trubble uv guverment, and a throwin 2 us sech offisis ez they do n't want 2 fill, with a prodygal hand! O the delites uv them picter! It may be realised. I give the follerin few plane rools to be follered by our workin committis: 1. Do n't argue, unless yoo kin git holt uv a Ablishnist who can't reed, and then be sure yoo git him out uv the way, wher no uther Ablishnists kin heer what yoo say 2 him. 2. Hev yoor knockin down committis on hand early, and be sure they are joodishus men, who will keep sober enuff 2 know who 2 hit. 3. Ef yoo hev a recent convert frum Ablishnism in hand, keep him drunk by all means, no matter wat the whisky costs. Ef he is allowd to git sober, he 'll be very apt to go agin us. 4. Git the fraudulent votes all in, early in the mornin, be4 too menny uv the enemy are on hand 2 be easily whaled. This is our last chance. Ef we fail on Micklellan, we 're gone in for want uv leeders. They must hev offis, for they can't live on credit forever. Rally, then, to the poles! Remember the drafts and the taxes, and rally! The opposishen tell us that we will be draftid and taxt, the same under Micklellan as under Linkin. It is probbyble; but O, my friends, can't yoo see how much better it is, that yoo shood be draftid and taxt for the benefit uv yer frends, than for the benefit uv yer enemies! We who expect to hold the offisis kin. Then make wun last effort, and deserve the success I wish we wuz shoorer uv winnin. Petroleum V. Nasby, Paster uv sed Church, in charge.</field>

I am a lost and rooined man. My peeple are uv the troo Dimekratik stripe. They hev faith in me. They bleeve wat I tell em.

'Rah!” shouts I, with grate presence uv mind. “Why good?” anxshusly asks the expectants. “Becoz, to carry Ohio, the Ablishnists must hev brot votes from Noo York, wich will give us that Stait, shoor.” Noo York—Linkin! “Good Lord!” ansers I, promptly; “the Noo York Ablishnists must hev votid in Ohio, and hev got home in time 2 vote agin. But wait for Pennsilwany.” Pennsilwany—Linkin! “My frends, ther wuz fraud—Massychusits soljers, at leest 40,000, must hev votid there. Injeana will do it, however.” Injeana—Linkin! “Not less than 40,000 Massychusits soljers hev votid there. Illinois is safe, though.” Illinois—Linkin. “40,000 Massychu—” “Give me my munny!” roard Savij, and the same remark, with variashens, wuz made by Guttle, Sludge, and the rest uv em. “Gently, my frends,” sed I, backin out uv the door. “We hev bin defeetid, but the grate principple that a white man is better than a nigger, for wich we hev so long fought, still lives. Let us sink all miner considrashens, and”— The miner considerashens I referred to wuz, however, uppermost in their minds, for they all went for me, yellin like Cuscororious Injins, “Give me my munny!” whereupon I retreeted 2 the meetin-house, lockin myself in. They surroundid it, swarin they 'd starve me out. When a innocent boy, I red a harrowin tale uv a Rooshn muther, who wuz persood by frantic wolves, and who saved her own life by droppin her children to em, wun by wun. My privit barel uv whisky wuz in my study—I wuz saved! I histid it out uv a winder, and calmly awaited results. They flockt around it—they took turns at the bung-hole. In wun short hour they wuz stretched helpless on the plane, ded drunk.

He told us that if Linkin should our ruler be, He 'd take our niggers from us all, and every one set free. That, wuss than that, if we to him the power to do it gave, Black Cuffee he 'd the master be, and Joe Bowers be the slave. PART THE 2. Election past, and our Breckinridge wuz cadawshusly chawd up, For Linkin run the appinted race jest like a yaller pup; Then the man wat told us how to vote, come round and sed that we Could only find our rites in the South Confed'racy. I did n't understood it, but I histid up my hat For Suthern rites, our system, and sech other things as that, Attendid all the meetins held to help along the cause, And viggerously damd old Abe and his Abolishn laws. The war broke out, and me and Ike bled mity freely then; I gave a thousand dollars toward a regiment of men, And thought that if 't would keep our nigs from bein stole away, The money we invested wuz well spent, and sure would pay.

By castin a prophetic eye backards, a massive intellek kin dissern errors wich hev bin made, and kin dodge em in the dim and misty fucher. The old Dimokrasy was wopt in the larst campane, solely and entirely becoz uv its own stoopidity and cowardis. I say it boldly. We did n't bleeve in the war—we wuz opposed to it in the beginnin; we wantid the guvment revolooshnizd to keep Noo Ingland, wich is spredin herself all over the West, frum submergin the entire Dimekratik party. Our bark wuz on the sea—slaivry wuz its anker, its jib-boom, its rite forrerd mast, its bow-sperit, its keel, its all. Slaivry wuz our best and only holt. The Suthners wantid controle uv the nashen, that they mite yoose the sed nashen for the excloosive benefit uv slaivry. Werry good. They held all the big orfisis for them purpus; but, thank Hevin, the slaveholders coodent hold all the orfisis! Ther was n't enuff uv em, halleloogy! They could n't come up North and hold the post-orfisis, glory! O them good ole times! They wuz libral and eezy to pleeze. They allowed us 2 hev a President occasionally, ef we presentid a man who cood give bonds to em 2 perform ez they desired. Peerse wuz wun uv this kind, and Bookannon wuz another, and the larst. Ther labor wuz complikatid and severe. Peerse hed to establish the immaculate consepshun uv Popler Suvrinty, against all Dimekratik presedent, and poor ole Bookannon wuz forced 2 strangle the noo-born baby, and give birth 2 the Lecompton bill, wich wuz a severe operashen for wun so old and frale. Noo Ingland rebeld, and elektid Linkin. The South appeled 2 arms. Then wuz our golden opportoonity. We shood hev took up arms, druv the yooserper frum his seet, and installd in his place a sound, conservativ, constooshnel Dimekrat. Uv coorse, the Ablishnists wood hev resistid. Ah! I shood want em to. Doth the majestik eegle appeze his royal appetight on bare bones? He dothent. The fat and joosy karkis is wat his hart desires. O how I wood hev liked to hev led a regiment uv sich braves ez them frends uv the lait Governor Seemer, who killed the niggers in Noo York, last yeer, thro the rich towns uv Massychusitts! Wher the karkis is, ther the buzzerds will be also. We did n't do this. What wuz the next best thing? Cleerly 2 elect ez President a Dimekrat who hed Dimokrasy enuff to turn the guvment over to its legitimit owners ez soon ez he got it. A uncondishnel peese man wuz wat we wantid, and on a uncondishnel peese platform. We hed hed 3 yeers uv war, uv taxis, uv drafts, and a whalin draft wuz a hangin over us at the time. We wuz shoor uv 6 classis, to-wit, viz: The Dimekrat proper, who got his pollytix by inheritanse. The casheerd army orfisers, dismist becoz they disapproved uv the manner in wich the war wuz bein conduktid. The gentlemanly contracters, who hed furnisht hoss-beef and shoddy cloth 2 the soljers, and hed bin caught at it. The cowardly cusses, who wuz afeerd uv drafts. The cappytalists, who hed investid in Confedrit bonds. The miserly cusses, who groaned at taxes. Heer wuz a array—a phalanks that coodent be broken; for wen a man is mean from interest, argument won't tetch him. It 's shootin paper wads aginst a iron-clad. Yoo mite ez well whisper 17 Gray's Elegy in2 the ear uv a ded guvment mule, wich is sed 2 be the dedest thing on earth. But Micklellan wuz nominated. O, wat stoopidity! It wuz dun 2 ketch the War Dimekrats, they sed. The War Dimekrats lifted up the General's kote-tale and found Pendleton there, and they skatterd. The anti-draft and anti-tax Ablishnists thought they 'd ruther be taxt and draftid and taxt by Linkin, who hed alluz drawd it mild, than by Micklellan. The soljers remembered Chickahominy swamps. The shoddy theeves knowd they 'd stand no chance agin sech expert practishners ez the Woods, and Toucey, and sich, and so we wuz beeten. I hev hopes that we will yet kum out rite. Geff'son Davis is armin the niggers; the Dimokrasy hev seed the folly uv philanderin after war, and wun good Confedrit victry will set us up agin. Let the Dimekratik virgins keep their lamps full uv ile and trimmed. Petroleum V. Nasby, Lait Paster uv the Church uv the Noo Dispensashun.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LXXIV. DEPRECATES THE ARMING OF THE SLAVES BY THE SOUTH. Saint's Rest, (wich is in the Stait uv Noo Gersey,) } November the 21st, 1864. The brave and shiverlus South hev at last desided upon armin their niggers. Ef they do it, it settles the question. The Ablishn party is neerly eggsaustid, and can not hope to cope successfully with three millions uv fresh niggers, the most uv em desendid drekly from the fust families uv the South. The nigger will fite! I may hev sed at diffrent times, when the goriller Linkin wuz armin uv em, that they woodent fite, but it wuz a lie uv the basest character, that I got up 2 deseeve the peeple. Does Boregard fite? Does the younger Masons, and Peytons, and Ruffins, and Slidells, and sich? Where do they get their shiverlus darin frum? Onqueschenably frum the old Boregard, Mason, Peyton, Slidell, et settry. Werry good. Admittin it 's blood that does it, won't the same blood that makes Kernel Peyton shivelrus, operate the same way when coursin thro the vanes uv Sam, his haff-brother? Uv coarse. Like causes perdoose like effex. Ef Kernel Peyton taiks a dose uv pills, wat 's the result? Precisely the same ez wen Pomp takes em. Blood, like pills, operate the same on all constooshns. The mizable hirelins uv Linkin will rue the day they meet these dark knites. The Suthern white soljer is, I am aware, a mizable cuss. He wuz born a serf; nacher made him expressly for them system uv sosiety, and he coodent eggsist nowhere else. The Suthern lord uv the sile reqwires various serviss. Manyooel laber is dun by the black, but his votin must be dun by whites. Nacher steps in and furnishes him a man white enuff to vote, and low enuff to be owned. He hez no shiverlry, and woodent fite at all ef 't want for the bloodid offisers. Imagin entire regyments uv blooded men—men uv the fizzikle strength uv the native Afrikin, animated with the sperit uv the hawty Southron—a goriller with the sole uv Shevaleer Bayard. I hev prayd that Linkin will spare the South this bitter cup. Hez the retch no sole? Imagin a Suthern offiser a leedin his regyment in2 battle. He drors nigh to the enemy. Whiz! sings a shell. It explodes! He is safe, but, alars! dispersed in2 inch peeses is Sipio, his nigger, and perhaps the son uv his grandfather's son, or, may be, the unkle uv his own children! That shell cost him ?1,500. A rifle pops, and Pompey dies, who, livin, wood hev bin dirt-cheep at ?1,200. And so he goes. He treds the path uv glory over the ded bodies uv his blood relashens, which is also his forchune. Agin. Ef the nigger fites alongside uv the white man, he is acknollijed ez his ekal, and away goes the corner-stun uv Dimokrasy. It hez alluz bin a consolashen to the Northern Dimekrat to feel that ther wuz a race meaner than they air. Shel this pleezin deloosion be roodly dissipatid? Ferbid it, Hevin! This sacrifis may be avoidid. Linkin hez bin slitely electid, and inezmuch ez he hez controle uv suthin over a milyun muskits, with artilry 2 match, we Dimekrats, hevin alluz bin a law-abidin peeple, shel submit quietly 2 the popler voice. But we kin advize. Linkin hez it in his hands. Let him make peese immejitly and to-wunst. Let him send commishners 2 Richmond, under same pay ez members uv Congris, (I will go for wun,) to treet and be treeted. Let us act upon the Micklellan ijee. Let us offer them all they want to kum back, and ef they refooze—why then fite it out, on constooshnel, conservative principples. Ef they do refooze, and the war shood be properly conductid, I shood sacrifice all for my bleedin country, and go into the servis ez a sutler. I cood not hesitate for a moment. Petroleum V.

      <field name="fulltext">LXXV. HAS A FRIGHTFUL DREAM. Saint's Rest, (wich is in the Stait uv Noo Jersey, } November the 29th, 1864. I 'm bein afflicted with dreems. It 's wery seldom that I lay my manly form down 2 rest, that dreems uv the most friteful karricter do n't take posseshun uv me, and I awake in the mornin feelin ez tired ez I do after a hard day's dodgin creditors, wich is exhaustin. Last nite I hed a dreem, the recolleckshun whereof is enuff 2 drive a dray hoss uv ordinary sensibilities crazy. Methawt Dimokrasy wuz ded, that his funeral wuz apinted for the 4th uv March, that that day had arriv, and that the frends uv the deceest hed bin inwitid. I wuz on the spot airly, but, 2 my surprize, quite a number uv mourners wuz there afore me. Ther wuz Thomus Gefferson, and Androo Jaxson, and Steven A. Duglis, and Silus Wright, and Jimmy K. Poke, and sich. The corpse wuz that uv a giant, who hed evidently died uv dissipashen—wunst strong and wiggerus, but redoost 2 a shaky skelliton. Presently Fernandywood, Frank Peerse, Vallandigum, and Vorhees hove in site. They kum a busslin up, ez tho they wuz the legitimit heirs and assigns aforesed uv the deceest, but ez soon ez they recognized them ez wuz standin round the corpse, they turned pale and sneeked off ez fast ez their legs cood carry em. These distinguished individooels wuz a weepin bitterly over the corpse, particklerly Gefferson. “I am his fond parient,” he exclaimed; “I guided his infant steps; I—but what the dev—” This exclamashen escaped Tomus, ez his eagle eye lit onto a bootiful nigger-whip wich the defunct hed clutched into his emashiatid hand. “He never got that from me,” continued Tomus, with a expreshun uv intense dissgust; “I sent the gushin yooth in2 the world to do away with them things.” Wright hed found a revolver and a pair uv handcuffs in his pocket, wich he dropped as tho they burnt him. Jaxon took out uv his vest a packige labeld “Stait Rites.” “Good hevins!” remarkt he, flingin it from him, “did the ijeot forgit my teechins ez soon ez I left him, and take up with the heresis uv that scoundril, Calhoon?” Duglis hed bin serchin, and next to the hart he found a hevy packige, markt “Seceshn,” at wich they all startid back with upliftid hands, ez I 've seed play-akters do when they see the gost uv ther ded muther. “He wuz devotid 2 his country wen I startid him,” sed Gefferson. “Him and me put our heel on seceshn wunst,” wept Jaxon. “My frends,” sed Duglis, “I wuz the guardian uv the deceest up to 4 yeers ago. He fell in2 bad hands in '52, and got wild. He becum quarrelsome, graspin, and at the saim time dissipatid. I tried to keep him strate, but in vane. Sich men ez Bookannon and Peerse hed more inflooense with him than I, and they led him astray. He squandered all the estate yoo left him, the valyooable part uv wich wuz bought in by a consern at the hed uv wich is A. Linkin, uv my Stait, who, by makin a proper yoose uv it, is doin a good biznis. To save him, I endorst for him in '60, but he bustid me, and sellin all that he had left, he went in2 the employ uv that Calhoon consern, wich wuz jest startin up, ez I left, and I am paned 2 say that he contracted 2 do all their dirty work. It wuz that wich killed him.” “Bury the cuss—he stinks!” exclaimed they all in korious, the noise whereof awoke me. I feel thankful that we modern Dimekrats see Gefferson, Jaxon, and sich, only in dreems. Petroleum V. Nasby, Lait Paster uv the Church uv the Noo Dispensashun.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LXXVI. PROPOSES THE EMIGRATION OF THE DEMOCRACY. Saint's Rest, (wich is in the Stait uv Noo Gersey,) } December the 8th, 1864. I reed in the Scripters (a book I alluz perooze whenever I 'm bad sick,) suthin about ten tribes uv Izrel that wuz lost. A ijee struck me. I see a way by wich the present unholy, devastatin war kin be stopped, and after givin the matter doo considerashen, I 'm conwinst uv its feezibility. It is EMIGRASHEN! The Suthern branch uv the Dimekratik party ought 2 be convinst, by this time, that they ain't a match for the Ablishnists a fightin, jest ez the Northern wing hez diskivered that it ain't no match for em a votin. The fact is, the entire plan uv repairin the old temple uv Dimokrasy with secession morter hez very much the appeerance uv a faleyoor. My father (a Noo Gersey Dimekrat,) wunst spilled lamp-ile on a noo kote. He askt a nabor, who wuz reckless, wat wood taik it out, and he told him sulphuric acid. The old man got some, and poured it on. The next day he went over to his adviser in great wrath, with the remnants uv the kote. “John,” said the old gentleman, “did n't yoo tell me that this yere acid wood eradicate greese from my kote?” “Certingly; did n't it?” “John, why did n't you likewise tell me that it wood also eradicate the kote?” Alas! the remedy Dimokrasy swallerd to cure the cramp colic it got in 1860, is gnawin its bowils. It is curin its ills ez stryknin duz hyderphoby in a dorg. 2 resoom. My ijee is Mexico. Let a peece be made, the terms uv which air, that jest sech uv the peeple uv the old Yoonitid Staits ez hev made up ther individjle minds that they can n't live under Ablishn tyranny, shel hev the privilege uv leevin with all ther goods and chattels. Then we 'll go to Mexico, upset that offshoot uv European monerky, Maxemilyen, and set up pure Dimokrasy, with ekal rites and slaivry ez the cornerstuns. Sum may obgect on the ground that Maxemilyen is by this time too hefty to be histid. Here is the forse we kin kalkilait on: Northern Dimekrats in Canady in consekence uv drafts, 200,000 Northern Dimekrats at home who spectd orfis under Micklellan, 1,460,000 Suthern army, say, 200,000 Grand totle, 1,860,000 Cood Maxemilyen stand afore sich a array ez that? Not enny. But sez wun, “Uv wat yoose wood them peece Dimekrats and draft skeedaddlers be to a military expedishen—they won't fite.” My gentle frend, Geff'son D., knows his biznis. Let him whisper in2 ther eers that eech and every wun uv em that survives shel hev a post-orfis, and they 'd wade in blood knee-deep. O, it would be a cheerin site to see them a chargin up the steeps uv Shepultepec, with the inspirin cry, “Post-orfis!” Evry wun uv em wood be a hero. There we 'd set up Dimokrasy agin. The country, uv coarse, we 'd divide, North and South, free and slave, for a Northern Dimekrat wood feel oneasy in his mind, ef he had n't a South to serve. We 'd hold Nashnel Convenshuns in the halls uv the Montezoomers, and, O, woodent it be soothin 2 agin heer Tooms and Rett, and them high-minded fellers, a bully-raggin uv us! Methinks. Ez every wun uv us wood be offis-holders, wher wood we git constitooence? Nacher hez perwidid. The natives uv that country wood serve admirably. But they coodent understand yoor speekers. Troo, but them Mexicans wood soot us all the better for not understandin English. Whenever a Dimekrat got sense enuff in2 him to comperhend our talk, he alluz left the party. Give me the voter who takes his faith on trust. It 's yoor inquirin minds that hez played the devil with us. I shel immejitly perpose the matter to President Davis. Petroleum V.

I 've tride it sevral times, but the result wuz never satisfactory. I never cood determine in my own mind ez to whether the sperits uv them ez purported to be strangers, wuz ginooine, not knowin ther stile, whereupon I wood call up the sperit uv a deceest acquaintance. The conversashen wood then run ez follows: Me.—“Is the sperit uv Jotham Smith present?” Sperit.—“It air. Who calls?” Me.—“Nasby, Petroleum V.” Sperit.—[Vehemently]—“Pay to my widder, yoo old theef, the 13 dolers and a harf yoo borrid uv me six yeers ago.” Now, that coodent hev bin the spirit uv Jotham Smith, becoz the sed Jotham, when in life, labord manfully for three yeers to git that munny, and hed signally faled, and for yeers hed quit tryin. It coodent hev bin Jotham, for he knode me too well. Ef it wuz his sperit, it proves concloosively to me that the sperit is etherial, and when releest from the body, wich restranes it, it becums flighty. A frend uv mine, here, is a speritooalist, and he invited me wun nite 2 a serkle. I went, hopin to find out what wuz the destiny uv the Dimekratik party. I boldly called for the sperit uv Androo Jaxon. It cum. “Androo,” sez I, “father uv Dimokrasy, I, wun uv yer perlittikkle children”— “Hold!” interuptid he. “Did yoo vote for Vallandigum?” “I supportid that persekootid saint.” “And Micklellan?” “Onquestionably I votid for that grate general and statesman.” “And after that yoo hev the impedence to call yerselves children uv mine! Yoor in error, my gentle frend, on the daddy question, or yoo lie wilfully. Yoor Dimekratik party hez n't my polittikle eyes, noze, mouth, or eckspreshun. Yoor the son uv that hory old traitor, Calhoon, and a mizable, deformd, misshapen ape it is. Yoo strangled the Dimokrasy I left yoo, and hev put Calhoon's into its cloze.” “Androo,” sez I, “how do yoo git along with the latter-day Dimokrasy, who deceese, universly regretted, et settry.” “Git along with em! They do n't none uv em cum here. Ther 's another and a hotterer plais for sich.” I then called for the sperit uv Floyd, Bookannon's Secretary, and late Genral in Confedrit servis. He kum to wunst. “J. B.” sez I, “wat is the fucher uv the Dimokratik party?” “Fucher!” replide he, smilin a sperit smile; “why, man, it 's in its fucher now. It 's deceest, and ought 2 hev a tomb-stun put up 2 commemorait its virchoos, immejitly, and regardlis uv expense. I say regardlis uv expense, becoz, the meaner a man is, the more tomb-stun he needs. Marble is the best material 2 tell lies on, now in yoose. 2 resoom. Dimokrasy wuz seezd with a mortle illnis in '60, wen Linkin wuz electid. The blood is the life. Offis is the blood uv Dimokrasy, and wen that wuz withdrawn, Dimokrasy wuz a depletid cuss. It struggled agin hope until last fall, when it kicked its last kick, and a mity week kick it wuz. Dostest thow think ef I cood hev bin Secretary uv War, perpetooally, with the unlimmytid fasilities for steelin we engoyed under Bookannon, that I wood hev rebelled? Not enny. The North druv us 2 it, by takin evry one of the offisis.” He woodent communikate no more, and the serkle closed. I am inclind to bleeve them sperits wuz ginooine.

Fancy the feelins uv a man who hed bin for weeks spectin 2 heer uv Sherman's bein entirely chawd up by the undanted Suthern melishy! The follerin impromptoo cuss and wale (ekally mixt) reflex the stait uv mind uv the Dimokrasy uv this sekshun. Hart-sick, weery, alone, bustid. Gone-up, flayed, skind, hung out. Smashed, pulverized, shiverd, scatterd. Physikt, puked, bled, blistered. Sich is Dimokrasy! Alone I sit, like Marius, among the rooins! Alone I sit and cuss, and this is my cuss: Cussid be Calhoon, for he interdoost us to that paintid harlot, Stait Rites, who sedoost us. Cussid be Peerse, who consentid 2 the Nebrasky bill, wich bustid us. Cussid be Bookannon, who favored Lecompton, wich peeled us. Cussid be Breckinridge, who woodent support Duglis, and 'lectid Linkin, wich give our post-or-fises 2 Ablishnists. Cussid be the post-masters—may they bekum suddently insane, and wildly go 2 trustin out postige stamps to Dimekrats. Cussid be Grant, and Sheriden, and Rosycrance, for they 've dun for Demokrasy. Cussid be them ez went in the army Dimekrats, and cum out Ablishnists. (Wich is a eppydemic.) Cussid be Vallandigum, wich went a practisin law, leevin me in the Dimokrasy biznis alone, without enny cappytle to run on. [SPESHLY HOT.] Cussid be Sherman, for he took Atlanta. And he marcht thro the Confedrisy, and respected not the feelins uv ennybody. 18 His path wuz, like Moses's, lit with pillers uv fire and smoke, only the fire and smoke wuz behind him. His path is a desert—lo, the voice uv the Shanghy is heerd not in all the land. And the people uv the South lift up ther voisis and weep, becoz their niggers are not. And he took Savanner, and cotton enuff 2 hev satisfide Bookannon's cabbynet. And he turns his eyes toward Charleston, and is serusly thinkin uv Richmond. He starteth with three-skore thousand—he stoppeth with three-skore and ten. The wind bloweth where it listeth—he listeth where he goeth. As the lode-stone is to steel, so is his steel to the Georgia nigger—it draweth him on. Who will save us from the fury uv this Sherman? who will deliver us from his hand? Johnston he beat, Hood he fooled, and Wheeler he flogged. Lee wood do it; but he 's holdin Grant, and can't let go uv him. So he cavorts ez he wills, like a yerlin mule with a chesnut burr under his tale. Bitter in the mouth uv a Dimekrat is qwinine, bitterer is gall, but more bitterer is Fedral victrys. We have bin fed on victrys lately, and our stumick turns. Played out is Davis, and Dimokrasy hez follered soot. The Dimokrasy is turnin war-men—they are bowin the knee to Linkin. Voorhees will yet be a Briggydeer, and Vallandigum will cry aloud for a war uv exterminashen, and Fernandywood will howl for drafts. For tho John Brown's body lies all mouldy in the grave, his sole is a marchin on. I ain't the rose uv Sharon, nor the lilly uv the valley—I 'm the last uv the Kopperheds! I bilt my polittikle howse on sand—it hez fell, and I 'm under the rooins. Uv pollytix I wash my hands, I shake its dust orf my few remanin garmence. Petroleum V.

Saint's Rest, (wich is in the Stait uv Noo Gersey,) } January the 15th, 1865. “The wagis uv sin is deth.” Sich is the substance uv a passage uv Skripter, wich, sence my exile 2 this lonely shoar, hez bin my solis. How troo the remark! How feerfly hez it bin reelized! The anshent Dimokrasy ownd this guverment, and mite hev hed it to-day. But then they wuz a rychus set. They wuz n't dissipatid. They did n't run after harlots. Jaxon, and Benton, and Silas Write, and sich men, who wuz men, kept us strate. But wen they went to their respective rewards, another class uv men okkepied us. Jim Bookannon and Jeff Davis took hold uv the Dimekratik kite, tore off its time-honored tale, Ekal Rites, and substitootid Slaivry. The result is before the world. Dimokrasy is in the mud, and the Ablishnists hev the post-orfisis. Alars!

In November our ark restid on Aryrat, and there it is, stuck, and we are dolefly lookin out uv the winders. Afore us, behind us, and on both sides uv us, we see our enemies, gorjusly drest in purple and fine linnen, and a holdin the orfisis.

Wendell Fillips pecks at our heds, and Horris Greely stampeth on our korns, and lo! our hands is tied. From our mountin-top we see the armies goin 4th to battle, and we behold the discumfercher uv our frends. And we make faces at our enemies. Sayin, Yet a little while, and England and France shel interfere. The provo-marshel roameth up and down the land, seeking whom he may conscript, and nobody dares bust him. And we make faces. All that pass by clap their hands; they hiss and wag their heds at us, sayin: Is these Dimokrasy? Is them the sons uv Jaxon? And we make faces. Two dollars is the tax upon whisky, and the tongue uv the sucker cleaveth to the roof uv his mouth for thirst; the young bummer asks for nips, but no man poureth out till he observeth the postal.

Humanity, pertiklerly Amerikin humanity, vewd from a Dimekratik stand-pint, is a inscrootable mystery. To the undersined it 's a staggrer. For instance. The normel instinks uv mankind is not 2 work. Dimokrasy hez bin a holdin out to the Amerikin peeple the priceless boon uv nigger slaivry—the onspeekible happinis uv hevin others swet for em—uv passin a lifetime a suckin mint-juleps thro straws, and smokin ten-cent cigars, on the work uv others. It wuz regectid. I wuz a thinkin the matter over to-nite, and I wuz shockt at the remarkable yoonanimity with wich evry distinktiv measure perposed by the Dimokrasy hez bin repoodiatid by the people. We told em the South wood rebel, ef they votid for Linkin. They votid for Linkin. We told em greenbax and guverment bonds wood be entirely worthless. They take the greenbax, and subscribe for the bonds with a loosenis onparalleled. We told em they cood never whip the South. They went in and are whippin the South, with neetnis and dispatch. We warned em agin drafts, and sich. They go and vote for drafts—indeed, I heerd wun recreant Dimekrat observe that he rayther liked a draft wunst or twict per annum, they varied the monotony. “And then,” sed he, “a feller feels so good when he finds he ain't drawd.” We told em the war wood go on ef Linkin wuz re-electid. They went and re-electid Linkin. We told em that any interference with slaivry wood rooin North and South. They abolisht it in a lump. In short, the peeple is crazy. Watever the Dimokrasy endorses, the peeple rejex; watever the Dimokrasy recommends, the peeple condemn. I 'm convinst uv the trooth uv the Millerite doctrine—the end uv the world is at hand. Ez for me, I care not how soon it comes. Life is not measured by yeers. I am 3 skore in yeers, but I hev consoomed enuff whisky for a man uv a hundred. Therefore I am reddy.

Ther air but a very few troo Dimekrats left in this sekshun uv Noo Gersey—very few. The young wuns hez all enlistid and turnd Ablishnists, and the old wuns er a peggin out with delirium tremens. The whisky we git now-a-days burns our coppers out feerfly. A few uv us, whose stumicks is trooly glass, met last nite to shed a teer or 2 over the fall uv Charleston. Square Potts, who hez bin the reglar chairman for this county for thirty yeers, tuk the cheer, on his own motion, weepin perfoosely.

The rest uv the awjence moved that they be vice-presidence, wich wuz carried, and they took their seets as sich, weepin perfoosely. Here a hitch okkurred—there wuz noboddy left for committy on resolushens. 3 uv the vice-presidence promptly resined and wuz electid ez sich committy, when they (weepin perfoosely) reportid the follerin, wich the secretary had prevously rit: Wareas, Charlston, the only plais on the continent wher pure Dimokrasy abidid, hez follerd Atlanty and Savanner, and fallen in2 the hands uv Ablish hirelins; and, [Here the secretary paused, that the flore mite be mopt.] Wareas, The prospek is lively for Richmond, and the rest uv the Confederasy follerin soot, there4, be it Resolvd, That we emfattically and unreservedly protest agin a further continooance uv this unholy, unconstooshnel, unmittygatid and sooisidle war. Resolvd, That we now manetane what we hev alluz assertid, that 8 milyuns uv free white men can't be subjoogatid at enny price. Resolvd, That we congratulait our heroic brethren uv the South, who is strugglin for ther rites, upon the successful evacuation uv Atlanty and Savanner and Charleston, becoz, hevin them plasis less to defend, they kin consentrait sumwheres to better advantige. Resolvd, That the slownis uv England and France at interferin, deservs our reprehenshun, and that ef they air ever goin to do it, now 's the time. Resolvd, That them Dimekrats who let on they feel ez good ez the Ablishnists do over these victrys, is unworthy the name. We warn em that it ain't no yoose. The Ablishnists have enuff strateouters uv ther own to hold all the orfises, and that turnin into war-men, at this lait day, is ruther 2 fishy to fool even the blindest uv em. Resolvd, That we damnd the war at the beginnin, and that we, uv Noo Gersey, dam it now, and will so continyoo to the end uv the chapter, bein conservative and terribly sot in our way.

We onhesitatingly recommend the latter coarse, providin alluz, they kin git back afore the next eleckshun. The resolushuns were, uv coarse, adoptid—the cheerman, ez is the custum here wen he wants resolutions past, only puttin the affirmative side. After wich I felt a call to speek, and I did so, remarkin: That the loosnis with wich teers wuz bein shed, showd that the hart uv the Dimokrasy wuz tutched; that I wuz glad 2 see em flow, becoz it showd how clost a feelin eggsistid atween the Dimokrasy, North and South. But there wuz reely no cause for teers. The triumfs the Ablishnists hed gained were no advantagis. Charleston hed fallen, it wuz troo. While I regrettid the hard necessity, I wuz trooly glad uv it. The feelins uv them peeple hed bin hurt, no dout. But wat uv that? It wuz easier to let go uv Charleston than 2 hold on to it. They coodent hold that city enny more than they cood Atlanty and Savanner, and, there4, strategy required its surrender. The good uv the Confedrisy required that they should leave, and O, my brethren, with wat alackrity they obeyed the call. They may find it necessary to resine Richmond. Shel we ther4 be cast down? Not enny. I see Lee's strategy. He calkilates on givin up all them towns. Grant and Sherman will hev to leave a garrison in each uv em, until ther armies is all divided up in2 garrisons; then cums the krisis. He takes them small garrisons, 1 at a time, and gobbles em. That 's his ijee, I make no dout. Let us, my brethrin, keep a stiff upper lip. The more territory Sherman gits, the wuss he is orf. I wate impashently to heer uv his marchin on, feelin that at last Lee will wax him. I concludid, leavin em in good humor.

Lee is in Richmond like a rat in a cistern—he can't git out, and it 's shoor deth to stay.

Wher is them who profeside that greenbax wood be wuthless, and swore they would never take em? Lo, they sell their hosses, and their wheat, and their lands, and will reseeve in pay therefor nuthin else; they hoard em clost, ez the hat will show that goeth around at the close uv my lectures. Where is them who contribbitid to the support uv Vallandigum? In my distress I asked wun uv em for a single quarter, and he bade me be damned. There is no faith in mankind—there is none troo—no, not wun. The party hez flickered out—it standeth not up in its strength—it hez no more backbone than a eel.

      <field name="fulltext">LXXXV. THE FALL OF RICHMOND AND LEE'S SURRENDER. Saint's Rest, (wich is in the Stait uv Noo Gersey, } April the 10th, 1865. I survived the defeet uv Breckinridge in 1860, becoz I knode the Dimokrasy cood rase up in arms agin the unconstooshnality uv electin a seckshnal President, who wuz impregnatid with any seckshnal ijees that he got north uv Mason and Dixon's line. I survived the defeet uv Micklellan, (who wuz, trooly, the nashen's hope and pride likewise,) becoz I felt assoored that the rane uv the goriller Linkin wood be a short wun; that in a few months, at furthest, Ginral Lee wood capcher Washinton, depose the ape, and set up there a constooshnal guverment, based upon the great and immutable trooth that a white man is better than a nigger. I survived the loss uv Atlanty, and Savanner, and Charleston, becoz, dependin on Suthern papers, I bleeved that them places wuz given up— mind, given up—becoz the Confedrits desired to consentrate for a crushin blow. I survived the fall uv Richmond, tho it wuz a staggrer; becoz I still hed faith that that grate and good man, Lee, did it for stratejy, that he mite consentrate hisself sumwhers else; and when the Ablishnists jeered me, and sed “Richmond,” and “Go up, bald-hed,” to me, I shook my fist at em, and sed, “Wait, and yoo 'll see.” I wuz a lookin for the blow that wuz to foller this consentratin. It cum! But it wuz us who reseevd it, and a deth-blow it wuz. Ajacks defied the litenin; cood he hev bin a Northern Dimekrat, and stood this lick unmoved, he mite hev dun it with perfek safety. “Lee surrenderd!” Good hevins! Is this the end uv the consentratin? Is this the dyin in the last ditch? Is this the fightin till the last man wuz a inanimait corpse? Is this the bringin up the childern to take their places, ez the old ones peg out under Yankee bullits? “Lee surrenderd! Why, this ends the biznis. Down goes the curtain. The South is conkered! CONKERED!! CONKERED!!! Linkin rides into Richmond! A Illinois rale-splitter, a buffoon, a ape, a goriller, a smutty joker, sets hisself down in President Davis's cheer, and rites despatchis! Where are the matrons uv Virginia? Did they not bare their buzzums and rush on2 the Yankee bayonets that guarded the monster? Did they not cut their children's throtes, and wavin a Confederit flag in one hand, plunge a meat-knife in2 their throbbin buzzums with the tother, rather than see their city dishonered by the tred uv a conkerer's foot? Alars! not wunst. Per contrary! I reed in the papers that they did rush wildly thro the streets, with their childern in their arms. But it wuz at the Yankee commissary trains, who give em bread and meat, wich they eat vociferously. Their buzzums wuz bare. But it wuz becoz their cloze hed worn out, and they did n't know how to weave cloth for new wuns. In breef, they actid about ez mean ez a Northern Dimekrat ever did, and to go lower is unnessary. This ends the chapter. The Confederasy hez at last consentratid its last consentrate. It 's ded. It 's gathered up its feet, sed its last words, and deceest. And with it the Dimokrasy hez likewise given up the ghost. It may survive this, but I can't see how. We staked our political fortune on it; we went our bottom dollar on it; it 's gone up, and we ditto. Linkin will serve his term out—the tax on whisky won't be repeeled—our leeders will die off uv chagrin, and delirium tremens and inability to live so long out uv offis, and the sheep will be skattered.

The hand uv the vile assassin hez bin raised agin the Goril—the head uv the nashen, and the people's Father hez fallen beneath the hand uv a patr—vile assassin. While Aberham Linkin wuz a livin, I need not say that I did not love him. Blessed with a mind uv no ordinary dimensions, endowed with all the goodness uv Washinton, I alluz bleevd him to hev bin guilty uv all the crimes uv a Nero. No man in Noo Gersey laments his untimely deth more than the undersined. I commenst weepin perfoosely the minit I diskivered a squad uv returned soljers cumin round the corner, who wuz a forsin constooshnel Dimekrats to hang out mournin. Troo, he did n't agree with me, but I kin overlook that—it wuz his misforchoon. Troo, he hung unoffendin men, in Kentucky, whose only crime wuz in bein loyal to what they deemed their guverment, ez tho a man in this free country coodent choose wich guverment he 'd live under. Troo, he made cold-blooded war, in the most feendish manner, on the brave men uv the South, who wuz only assertin the heven-born rite uv roolin theirselves. Troo, he levied armies, made up uv pimps, whose cheefest delite wuz in ravishin the wives and daughters uv the South, and a miscellaneous burnin their houses. Troo, he kept in2 offis jist sich men ez wood sekund him in his hell-begotten skeems, and dismist every man who refused to becum ez depraved ez he wuz. Troo, he wood read uv these scenes uv blood and carnage, and in high glee tell filthy anecdotes; likewise wood he ride over the feeld uv battle, and ez the wheels uv his gorgus carriage crushed into the shudrin earth the bodies uv the fallen braves, sing Afrikin melodies. Yet I, in common with all troo Dimekrats, weep! We weep! We wish it to be distinkly understood, we weep! Ther wuz that in him that instinktively forsis us to weep over his deth, and to loathe the foul assassin who so suddenly removed so much loveliness uv charikter. He hed ended the war uv oppression—he hed subjoogatid a free and brave peeple, who were strugglin for their rites, and hed em under his feet; but I, in common with all Dimekrats, mourn his deth! Hed it happened in 1862, when it wood hev bin uv sum yoose to us, we wood not be so bowed down with wo and anguish. It wood hev throde the guverment in2 confusion, and probably hev sekoored the independence uv the South. But, alas! the tragedy cum at the wrong time! Now, we are saddled with the damnin crime, when it will prodoose no results. The war wuz over. The game wuz up when Richmond wuz evacuated. Why kill Linkin then? For revenge? Revenge is a costly luxury—a party so near bankrupt ez the Dimokrasy can not afford to indulge in it. The wise man hez no sich word ez revenge in his dixonary—the fool barters his hope for it. Didst think that Linkin's deth would help the South? Linkin's hand wuz velvet — Johnson's may be, to the eye, but to the feel it will be found iron. Where Linkin switched, Johnson will flay. Where Linkin banished, Johnson will hang. Davis wuz shocked when he heard it—so wuz I, and, in common with all troo Dimekrats, I weep. Petroleum V.

In behaff uv that Dimokrasy I speak. “Ez hez bin menshund 2 yoo wunst er twict, a immense responsibility rests on yoor sholders. The Suthern Staits struggled for their rites, but were squelcht. They fought like heroes, but fell, becoz uv overpowrin numbers agin em. They 're down—yoor iron heel is on2 their necks. What will yoo do?

You 've got that unfortnit staitsman, Davis—he fell in2 yoor hands becoz he wuz ignorent uv the style uv yoor (lait Linkin's) minyuns. He mite hev knode that the soljers never seed a woman takin to the woods without chasin her. But he must not be hung. Dimokrasy looks upon the matter thus. “You can't hang a man for conspirin agin a guvment onless he taiks up arms. “Ef a few take up arms it 's only a riot, and no hangin matter, 'cept when Ablishnists like John Brown do it. In sich cases hangin is alluz in order. “Ef a number uv Staits do it, it 's a revolooshen, and them ez yoo capcher must be treeted ez bellyjiggerants and prizners uv war. To hang prizners uv war, Androo, is murder. “This would probably satisfy the South. At the North less is reqwired. The Dimokrasy is easily consiliatid.

      <field name="fulltext">LXXXIX. HAS A VISION. Saint's Rest, (wich is in the Stait uv Noo Gersey,) } May the 31st, 1865. Dreems wuz common in the old skriptooral times, and wuz considerd ez profetikle. I hed a dreem larst nite, wich may or not mene suthin. Ef it may, Lord help the undersined, is my prayer, continooally. I dreemd I wuz ded—that, assistid by a tyfus fever and 2 dokters, I hed bustid the bonds uv mortality, and hed sored 2 the unknone hereafter. Up I went to the gates uv the tother world, wher I wuz confrontid by Peter. “Wher yoo frum?” sez he. “Noo Gersey,” sez I. “Wuz yoo a good cittyzen?” sez he. “I wuz a Dimekrat who never skratcht a tikkit,” sez I. “Hev yoo votid that tikkit for the larst 4 yeers, and kin yoo rede?” sez he. “I hev and kin,” sez I. “Then yoor place is below,” sez he. “Git.” Wich I did. 20 I met his Majesty, Satan the I,at his door, and he welcomd me corjelly. I wuz disappintid in his persnel appeerance. He wuz a middle-ajed man, gentlemanly in style, resemblin Geff'son Davis very much, only hevin a more intellectooal cast uv countenanse. “Welkum,” sez he. “I hev bin spectin yoo sum time. Welkum, welkum!” “Hev yoo menny uv the Dimokrasy with yoo,” sez I. “Not menny uv the ginooine Koperheds,” sez he. “Uv coarse, yoo hev n't,” sez I; “we everage ez good ez”— “That 's not it,” sez he, gazin onto me with a expreshun uv intense fondnis, “that 's not jist it. All but about 10 or 11 frum eech county git out by pleedin ignorence, and idiocy, and sich. But it 's all rite. I make it up by hevin a hevier force 2 spare 2 stir up the few leeders. Yoo kin rede print, can't yoo?” he askt ankshusly. “I kin,” sez I. “All rite,” sez he. “Gefferson Davis will be along in a few months, tho ef he don't show more man than he did when he wuz caught, he 'll make poor amoosement.” “He 's a disgrace 2 his secks—he ort 2 hev bin a woman,” sez I. “Troo,” retorts he; “but, ez Shakespeer sez, `there's a divinity that shapes our ends.' Then Alec Stephens!” “Will yoo git him? He wuz originelly opposd 2 seceshn.” “That 's my best holt. Davis wuz alluz a secesh; Bengamin wuz, becoz he thawt it wood pay—on them I 've hed a morgige ever sense they arrived at the yeers uv akountability. Stephens knode seceshn wuz wrong—he can't pleed ignorance nor nuthin, for he warnd his peeple agin it, and then wuz bot up in2 doin it hisself for the poor privilig uv playin 2d fiddle to Geff Davis, who drawd a mizable bow hisself. I 've ded wood on him.” “Tell me, gentle sir,” sez I, “how about Fernandywood, Vallandigum, et al., ez the lawyers say.” “In doo time they 're mine,” sez he. “They can't save themselves by repentanse, even. They are now past forty, and if they 'd commense in ded ernest, tryin to do ez much good ez they hev bad, and lived till they wuz ez old ez Methoozeler, they could n't make a commencement toward balancin the books. By the way, speekin uv Methooseler, I hed to wate pashently for customers in them days, when men lived 900 yeers.” “There 's Corry, Colorado Jewet, and Alec Long,” continnerd he, “I 've hed my eye on. Jewit and Corry I 'll lose—there 's a place outside uv my goorisdicshen for sich. They ain't responsible, yoo see. The devils that wuz cast out uv the man and took refuge in the swine, left the swine when they wuz drowndid, and hev inhabitid menny men sence. Two uv em air in Corry and wun in Jewet, to-day. Alec Long hez, evry now and then, a glimrin uv sense; he shows, occashenally, surface indicashens uv intellek, not quite enuff to make a lunatic uv him, and too much for a ideot. I may git him, and may not. But yoo will hev plenty uv compny. The stand yoor party took, druv thousands uv men in2 cussednis, who knode better, and who, ef let alone, wood hev dodged me. I hev an eye on sum who denounst Vallandigum, and yet, when the screws wuz brot down on2 em—and, by the way, jist sich ez yoo turnd them sed screws, (and he pokt me jockelerly in the ribs)—actilly presided at Vallandigum meetins, and votid for him. Then, after he wuz defeetid, they swore they did n't vote for him at all, addin a dirty lie to the original sin, wich is givin the devil, (ez yoo stile me,) his due, with compound interest. “But excoose me—I 'll show yoo 2 yoor apartmence. This way, my deer sir.” I obgectid to goin, and looked anxshusly around for a escape. Observin this, a change cum o'er the polite gentleman afore me. His eyes glistend, a sulfrus streem ishood frum his mouth, his feet partid in2 hoofs, his fingers elengatid in2 claws. I observed a tale peepin down under his cote; in short, he was transformd in2 the identicle devil I hed seen on sevral occashens, when labrin under attax uv delirium tremens, sooperindoost by drinkin a barl or so too much elecshun whisky, doorin hotly-contestid campanes. He reecht one claw for me, when I awoke. 2 say I wuz rejoist at findin myself still on prayin ground, is week— 't wuz goy onspeekable. I can't interprit the dreem. Petroleum V.

      <field name="fulltext">XC. LAYS DOWN A PLATFORM FOR THE COMING CAMPAIGN. Saint's Rest, (wich is in the Stait uv Noo Gersey,) } June the 23d, 1865. These is the dark days uv the Dimokrasy. The misforchoons that befell our armies in front uv Richmond, the fall uv our kappytle, follered by the surrender uv our armies 2 Grant and Sherman, hez hurt us. Our leeders air either pinin in loathsum dunguns, inkarseratid by the hevindefyin, man-destroyin, tyranikle edix uv our late lamented President, or air barskin in the free air uv Italy and Canady. We hev no way uv keepin our voters together. Opposin the war won't do no good, for before the next elekshun the heft uv our voters will hev diskiverd that the war is over. The feer uv drafts may do suthin in sum parts uv Pennsylvany and Suthern Illinoy, for sum time yit, but that can't be dependid on. But we hev wun resource for a ishoo—ther will alluz be a Dimokrasy so long as ther 's a nigger. Ther is a uncompromisin dislike to the nigger in the mind uv a ginooine Dimekrat. The Spanish bull-fighter, when he wants to inflame the bull to extra cavortin, waves a red flag afore him. Wen yoo desire a Dimekrat to froth at the mouth, yoo will find a black face will anser the perpus. There4, the nigger is, to-day, our best and only holt. Let us use him. For the guidance uv the faithful, I shel lay down a few plain rools to be observed, in order to make the most uv the cappytle we hev: 1. Alluz assert that the nigger will never be able to take care uv hisself, but will alluz be a public burden. He may, possibly, give us the lie by goin to work. In sich a emergency the dooty uv every Dimekrat is plane. He must not be allowed to work. Associashens must be orgenizd, pledgd to neether give him employment, to work with him, to work for enny one who will give him work, or patronise enny wun who duz. (I wood sejest that sich uv us ez hez bin forchoonit enuff 2 git credit, pay a trifle on account, so ez to make our patronige worth suthin.) This course, rigidly and persistently follerd, wood drive the best uv em to steelin, and the balence to the poor-houses, provin wat we hev alluz claimd, that they air a idle and vishus race. Think, my brethren, wat a inspirin effeck our poor-houses and jails full uv niggers wood hev on the peeple! My sole expands ez I contemplait the deliteful vision. 2. Likewise assert that the nigger will come North, and take all the good places, throwin all our skilld mekaniks out uv work by underbiddin uv em. This mite be open to 2 obgecshuns, to-wit: It crosses slitely Rool the 1, and men mite say, ef there 's jist enuff laber for wat 's here, why not perhibit furriners frum cumin? I anser: It 's the biznis uv the voter to reconsile the contradikshun—he may bleeve either or both. Ez to the sekund obgeckshun, wher is the Dimekrat who coodent be underbid, and stan it even to starvashen, ef the underbidden wuz dun by a man uv the proud Kaukashen race? and wher is the Dimekrat so lost to manhood ez not to drink blud, ef the same underbiddin is dun by a nigger? The starvin for work ain't the question—it 's the color uv the cause uv the starvashen that maiks the diffrens. Nigger equality may be workt agin, 2 advantage. All men, without distinckshun uv secks, air fond uv flatrin theirselves that sumbody 's lower down in the skale uv humanity than they is. Ef 't wan't for niggers, what wood the Dimokrasy do for sumboddy 2 look down upon? It 's also shoor to enlist wun stile uv wimmen on our side. In times gone by, I 've notist gushin virgins uv 45, full 16 hands high and tuff ez wire, holdin aloft banners onto wich wuz inscribd— “Save us frum Nigger Equality.” Yoo see it soothed em 2 hev a chanse uv advertisin, 1st, That they wuz frale, helplis critters; and, 2d, That, anshent and tuff ez they wuz, sum wun wuz still goin for em. Ef ther ain't no niggers, sentrel committis must furnish em. A half dozen will do for a ordnary county, ef they 're hustled along with energy. Ef they won't steel, the sentrel committis must do it theirselves. Show yer niggers in a township in the mornin, an the same nite rob the clothes-lines and hen-roosts. Ever willin 2 sacrifice myself for the cause, I volunteer to do this latter dooty in six populus countis. These ijees, ef follerd, will, no doubt, keep us together until our enemies split, when we will reep the reward uv our constancy and fidelity. May the Lord hasten the day. Petroleum V.

I hev bin in Washinton, and while ther I wuz interdoost to Gineral Marion Sumpter Fitzhoo Gusher, uv Mississippy. I wuz anxious 2 meet with a representativ Dimekrat uv the South, 2 interchange views, to hev soothin confidencis, to unbuzzum, becoz for the past 4 yeers the Dimekratik party hez bin trooly seckshnal, and the seckshun it hez okkepied is not the identikle seckshun onto wich the orfises is lokatid, and only by a perfeck union with our wunst-loved brethren uv the South, kin we ever git onto trooly nashnel ground. Gineral Gusher is a troo gentleman of the raal Suthern skool. He puts C. S. A. arter his name onto the hotel register, and his rings, buzzum-pin, and the hed uv his cane, is all made uv the bones uv mizable Yankee soldiers who fell at Bull Run—he sez by his own hand, and it must be so, for who ever knode a Suthern man to boast vaingloriously? We met and embraced, weepin profoosely. “Alars!” sobbed the Gineral, “wat a nitemare hez obskoord our respective vishuns for the past 4 yeers! I wuz alluz a Union man, alluz! alluz! alluz! The old flag I lovd with more nor parental affeckshun—2 me it wuz more nor life!” “Why, then, my Ajacks,” sobbed I, “did you raise your parisidle hand agin it?” “Why, my beloved! Because MY STAIT secesht, and I wuz carried along by a torrent uv public opinion, wich I cood not stem, and I went with her. But it 's all over. We hev awoke, and I 'm here in the capital uv my beloved country, under the shadder uv that glorious flag wich is the pride uv Americans and the terror uv all weak nashens wich hez territories contiguous, reddy to taik a oath, and resoom the citizenship I laid orf, and agin run the guverment for its own honor and glory.” “Hev yoo a pardon?” says I. “Methinks, wunst a paper reecht my humble village, wich is unanimously Dimekratik—it cum around a package of goods from Noo York—and in that paper I saw your name ez wun uv the orfisers who killed the niggers at Fort Piller. Am I rite?” “You air. I 'm a gushin child uv nacher—I 'm enthoosiastic. Labrin under the same deloosion that secesht us, I bleevd at that time that I wuz doin a good thing in killin them property uv ours that Linkin hed shovd bloo kotes onto. I hev no apologies to offer—I am now writin a justificashen. “I, and I speek for thousands uv the shivelrous sons uv the South, who would like a good square meal wunst more, am willin to be consiliatid. The oppertoonity is now offered the guverment to consiliate us. We are returnin prodygle sons—kill yoor fattid veel, and bring out yoor gold rings and purple robes, and sich. We ask condishns—we shel insist on terms; but we air disposed to be reasonable. We are willin to acknoledge the soopremacy uv the guverment, but there must be no humiliashen. A proud, high-spiretid people, like us uns, won't stand it—no sir, we can not. Ther must be no hangin, no confisticashen, no disfranchisin. We are willin to step back jest as we stept out, resoomin our old status, trustin to engineerin to git sech uther pints ez air not here enoomeratid. Without them condishns, the Union wood not be wun uv hart— 't wood be holler mockery. Wat we are goin for is a Union foundid on luv, wich is strongerer and more soldier than muskits. Harts is trumps—let the platform be harts, and all is well.” “But, Gineral,” sez I, “in all this wat do yoo perpose for us Northern Dimekrats?” “Towards them our bowils melt with luv. We forgive yoo. Ef yoo kin take the old attitood, well and good—ef not”— “Hold!” sez I, “do n't threat. A ginooine Northern Dimekrat wants but little here below, but wants that little long. Give him a small post-orfis, a nigger-driver to look up to, and a nigger to look down to, and he is soopreemly happy. Ef a angel in glory wuz two offer 2 trade places with him, harp, golden crown and all, he would ask odds.” “Uv course them positions yoo kin hev—we do n't want em. All we ask is to make the platforms, and hev sich orfises ez hawty, high-toned men kin afford 2 take, and yoo uns kin hev the rest. “But wun thing must be understood. The scenes uv the Charleston Convention must never be re-enactid—their must be no more Duglissis. Under the new dispensashun yoo dance whenever we fiddle, askin no questions. The Suthern hart must never agin be fired—it would consume itself. “Ez soon ez I hev took the oath, I shel immejitly go hum and run for Congris—see to it that ye hev enuff Dimekrats ther, that we, jintly, kin control things. Uv coarse, in a Union uv luv, ther must be equality. Linkin's war debt must never be pade, onless ourn is; his hirelins must never be pensioned, unless our patriots is. Wat a deliteful spectacle! Men, who, yisterday, wuz a gougin eech other onto the feeld of battle, to-day a drawin penshuns amikably, from the same treasury! The eagle wood flop his wings with goy, and angels wood exclame, “Bully!” I am disabled from wounds received on the feeld, and rejoice that our penshun laws is so libral. “Go home, my frend, and marshel for the conflict. Tell yoor centrel committis to collect expense munny, and I, and Ginral Forist, and Kernel Moseby, and Champ Ferguson, and Dick Turner, and Boregard, and perhaps that noble old hero, (take orf yoor hat while I pernounce his gellorus name,) Ginral Robert E. Lee, will cum up and stump the North for yoor tikits. I hev dun. I go.” “Noble man,” thot I, ez he stalkt magestically away, takin, in a abstractin manner, my new hat and umbreller, leavin his old wuns, “who coodent foller thee, and sich ez thee, forever and forever?” Petroleum V.

      <field name="fulltext">XCIII. “DREAMS A DREAM.” Saint's Rest, (wich is in the Stait uv Noo Gersey, } July the 21st, 1865. Dreems is becomin the most commonest recreation I hev. I don't know whether these dreems is the sperit uv prophecy, sugar-coated with sleep, or whether they are sooperindoost by the reglar three-quarters uv a pound uv tripe I eat at about 11½ P. M.; but dreems I hev Last nite I dreemed that I hed bridgd time, and wuz set ahead about nine months, wich time brings forth events in pollytiks, ez well ez in other things too tejus to menshun. Methot the South hed bin consilliatid and reconstructid, and hed cum back into the sisterhood uv Staits, ez sisters ginrally cum back after a quarrel. South Carliny wuz representid in the house by Ginral Swasher, and all the Rhetts, et settry, and Missippy by a dozen or 2 kernels and ginrals, for that Stait sent none to Congress ceptin its heroes. Geffson Davis wuz a candidait, but hevin sed, in his zeel for repudiashen, that he wuz for repudiatin all debts, his constitooency wuz afraid that he mite inclood the Confedrit war debt, so they defeeted him, and electid Ginral McGoujum, who held that the Fedral war debt wuz unconstooshnel, and must be repudiatid, while the Confederasy's hed ought to be paid ez a consilatory measure. The ginooine Dimokrasy uv the North hed electid enuff members to give the South control uv Congris. In my dreem I wuz seatid in the gallery uv the House. A member frum Noo York wuz introdoosin a bill appropriatin a sum uv money for the purpose uv erectin a monument to the memory uv the Union soljers who fell at Gettysburg. No sooner hed the fanatic red the title uv the bill, than Ginral McGoujum and Swasher, and Kernel Pelter, uv Georgy, walked over to his seet, and with their canes beet him over the hed twenty or fifteen minits. He wuz carried out for ded. Ginral McGoujum claimd the floor. “Mr. Speeker,” sed he, “I 'm bilin! Indignashen is a heevin and tossin my shivelrus sole in a most tremenjusly toomulchus stile. I am, Mr. Speeker, a cittyzen uv this gellorus Republic. I stand here, 2-day reconstructid and consillyatid— a loyal man. I hev took the oath, and sence hev violatid no rool or custom uv this House. I hev drawd my pay promptly—I hev even wented so 21 fur in the sperit uv fergivenis and Christian charity, ez to take that pay in greenbax, instid uv demandin gold, notwithstandin every wun uv em bears the portrait uv that feendish ape, that thirster after gore, that destroyer uv habis corpusis and constooshnel rites, our late lamentid President. After makin these sacrificis, shel I sit here camly, and allow a negro-steelin Yankee to insult the South with alloosions to Gettysburg, and sich? Never! Shel a Noo York missegennygenashunist, in this ere hall, perpose 2 appropriate the treasure uv our common country to commemorate a field on wich my constitooency wuz walloped, without rebuke? Never! He hez bin rebuked—let him heed the warnin.” Several Ablishn members riz, but the Dimokrasy wuz firm, and woodent let em speek. The Southern members wuz a goin to withdraw in a body, wen Fernandywood rose and perposed a compermise, ez follows: That harmony and good feelin shood prevale, hentz4th and forever. The word “war” shel never be yoosed in these hall; that, whenever referred to, it shel be termed “misunderstandins.” That the flags, cannon, and sich-like trophies, found by the Fedral army in various parts uv the Southern Staits, be to wunst destroyed. That penshuns be pade to the misunderstandinists from both sekshuns, for servises renderd the guverment. That the very fields on2 wich these misunderstandins occurred, be plowed over at the expense uv the guverment. That no book be publisht givin any akount uv prison-life, or sich. That bunkum orators in this House draw their alloosions to our military fame solely from the Mexikin war. The compermise wuz uv coarse adoptid. Ez the vote wuz announst, Ginral McGoujum and Fernandywood rusht in2 eech uther's arms, and wept down eech uther's bax, while Kernel Pelter waved a flag over em, formin a picter trooly tetchin. “Thank hevin,” I exclaimed, ez I awoke frum this refreshin sleep, “Brooks is ded, but his sperit still lives—his sole is marchin on.

      <field name="fulltext">XCV. ISSUES AN ADDRESS TO THE SOUTHERN DEMOCRACY. Saint's Rest, (wich is in the Stait uv Noo Gersey,) } July the 21st, 1865. To the Dimokrasy uv the Suthern Staits: Deerly beloved, I saloot yoo! The evence uv the past 4 yeers hev bin momenchus. The war hez ended—to a sooperfishel observer it wood seem disastrusly to yoo and us, but to him whose eagle eye kin pierce the misty fucher, gellorusly. Troo, we lost the orfises, and hev bin for 4 long and weery yeers on steril ground, whose froots wuz wormy and whose water wuz bitter. So the children uv Izrel wandered forty yeers in the wildernis, but they finelly found a Canan, full uv fatnis, runnin with milk and honey, and sich, so shel we emerge into our Canan ere long. The war hez hed its uses. We hev diskivered that the Suthern Dimekrat cood be dependid on to fite; yoo hev diskivered that the Northern Dimekrat cood be depended on to do yoor dirty work, thro thick or thin, and we hev both diskivered that the Ablishnist is no coward, and will reely make sacrifices for principle. Knowin all this, we kin work intelligently in the fucher. It is the dooty now uv every Suthern Dimekrat to take the oath, to wunst, and be metamorphozd in2 loyalty. Then we 've got em. Demand, ez only a Sutherner kin demand, that the military be withdrawd, and that yoor representatives be admitted. Then, ef we kin carry enuff deestriks North, yoo hev the game in yoor own hand. But to accomplish this last feet, yoo must aid us. We hev bin unforchnit in our politikle venchers, and at leest wun uv our prophecies must cum troo, utherwise how kin we go afore the people? The nigger is all we 've left, and the variety we hev up here is uv no yoose to us, for they are all earnin their own livin, and ain't crowdin white folks out uv poor-houses, at all. It 's my candid convickshun that the grovelin cusses work and earn munny, jest 2 spite us. In sum localities, our sagashus managers hev indoost sum uv em to drink with em, and in a few months got em into delirium tremens, and their families in2 poor-houses. To their untuterd bowels our likker is litenin. But this can't be dun ginrally, becoz it 's all our leeders kin do to keep their own skins full. To yoo we look for aid. A enterprisin Yankee (cusses on the race!) wuz wunst askt wat biznis he followd to make so much munny. He replide that he hed the itch, and he traveld ahed, givin it to people, his brother comin immejitly after, sellin a cure. Let us imitait their wisdom. Promptly ship to eech Northern stait 200,000 old wuns who can't work, and to make asshoorence doubly shoor, starve em awhile, and run the measles and small-pox thro em. Mix with em a few thousand black wimmen with mulatter children, to show the horrors uv amalgamashun. Then we 'd hev suthin to go on! Ez we carted em in2 poor-houses, and levid taxis to support em, how our speekers wood gush! how our papers wood howl! After 4 yeers uv failyoor in the prophecy biznis, the ijee uv hevin wun cum troo, sets me into a delirium tremens uv goy. Then, immejitly, yoor legislachers must pass stringent laws agin a nigger leavin his respective county, and then pass another law not allowin any man to give able-bodied wuns to exceed ?5 a month. This dun, I hev faith to bleeve thousands uv em will beg to be agin enslaved, about mid winter. Ef they will persist in dyin in freedom, we kin, at least, pint 2 ther bodis, and say in a sepulkrel tone: “Wen niggers wuz wuth ?1500, they wuz not allowd to die thus—behold the froots uv Ablishn philanthropy!” Either way, it 's cappitle for us. Yoo must inkulkate the doctrin uv State Rites, zeluser than ever, and while yoo air gittin yoor peeple tuned up on that, we 'll hammer away at debt and corupshun, and sich deliteful themes, and wunst more we 'll git the Ablishnist under our feet. I hev indikatid breefly the ginral outlines uv the polisy we must pursoo ef we wood succeed. Uther ijees will sejest themselves to yoo—let us hev em, and we 'll act on em. In conclooshun. Be wary and untirin. Remember, on yoo depends the politikle forchoons uv the thousands who wunst held offis, but who hev bin to grass for 4 long weery yeers. We must succeed now or never.

Jeff Davis a pinin in a loathsum dungun—the English cappitalists a mournin for their cotton-bonds, and refusin to be comforted because the Confedrasy is not—Mrs. Surratt a danglin in the air—military courts plenty and habis corpusis skarce—the loosenis with wich peeple put ther munny into 7-30's— the soljers returnin and goin for constooshnel Dimekrats, and the ginral demoralization uv Dimokrasy, all conspired to give me the horrors, and to add to my distress, the jug wuz out! To avoid madnis, I took up the Bible, (I board with a justice uv the peace, who hez to keep one to sware witnesses on,) and happend to open at the 9th chapter uv Jennysis. Yoo know all about that blessid chapter. Noer, after the water went down, cum down from Aryrat, went into farmin, and planted grapes extensive. One day he took a nip too much, and laid down with insuffishent clothin onto him. His 2d son, Ham, seed him in that fix, and when Noer awoke, while his hair wuz still pullin, he cust him, and his posterity, and sed they shood be servance forever. Ham (wich in the original Hebrew signifies a hind-quarter uv a hog,) wuz the father uv the Afrikins, and they hev bin slaves ever sence. I seed a lite to wunst—I realized the importance uv the nigger. He is the connectin link in the chane uv circumstances wich led to the formashen uv the Dimekratic party. He hez kept the blessid old masheen a runnin to this day. Observe. Whisky (or wine, wich is the same thing,) made Noer tight. Ham seed Noer inebriated. Noer cust Ham, wich turned him into a nigger and a servant. That the Skripters mite be fulfilled, the childern uv Ham wuz brot to Amerika, to be servance here. Wikkid men set themselves agin the Skripters, and tried to make men uv the niggers. The Dimekratik party ariz for the purpus uv keepin the nigger down, and that deliteful biznis hez given them employment for mor'n 30 yeers. Ez I shet the book I cood not help remarkin, in the words uv the sammist: “Good Lord, upon what slender threds Hang everlastin things!” Sposin Noer, instid uv plantin grapes, hed gone to practisin law, or into the grocery biznis, or buyin prodoose on commishn, or puttin up patent medicins—he woodent hev got inebriated; he woodent hev cust Ham. Ham woodent hev turned black; there woodent hev been no niggers, no Ablishnists, and, consequently, no Dimekrats. Or, sposn all uv Ham's children hed taken diptheria, and died; the same results wood hev follered. Whisky made nigger—nigger made Dimokrasy. Take away whisky and nigger, and Dimokrasy woodent be uv no more akkount than a one-armed man at a raisin. Whisky! Nigger! Dimokrasy! O, savory trinity!

The utter and abgect state uv cussitood into wich the Dimokrasy find theirselves, North and South, makes a day uv fastin approprit. Ef the Lord is ever a goin 2 help us, now 's his time. Ef my clerikle brethrin uv the Church South deside to appint a day uv fastin and prayer, I submit the follerin ez a sam uv agony, approprit for the occasion: A SAM UV AGONY. On the street I see a nigger! On his back a coat uv bloo, and he carryeth a muskit. He is provo-guard, and he halteth me, ez wun hevin authority. And my tender daughter spit on him, and lo! he arrested her, and she languisheth in the guardhouse. My eyes dwell on him, an my sole is a Artesian well uv wo; it gusheth with greef. For that nigger wuz my nigger! I bought him with a price. Alas! that nigger is out uv his normal condishn; he is a star out uv its speer, which sweepeth thro the politikle hevens, smashin things. Normally, he wuz wuth gold and silver—now he is a nitemare. Wunst I wuz rich, and that nigger wuz the basis thereof. Wo is me! I owned him, sole, body, muscles, sinoos, blood, boots, and brichis. His intellek wuz mine, his body wuz mine, likewise his labor and the froots thereof. His wife wuz mine, and she wuz my conkebine. The normal results uv the conkebinage I sold, combining pleasure and profit in a eminent degree. And on the price thereof I played poker, and drank mint-gooleps, and rode in gorgus chariots, and wore purple and fine linen every day. Wuz this miscegenashun, or negro equality? Not any. For she wuz mine, even as my ox, or my horse, or my sheep, and her increase wuz mine, even as wuz theirs. Ablishn miscegenashun elewates the nigger wench to his level. I did it for gain, wich degraded her muchly. And when the wife of my buzm lifted up her voice in complaint, sayin, “Lo, I am abused—this little nigger resembleth thee!” half the price uv the infant chattel wood buy a dimund pin with wich to stop her yawp. And my boys follered in my footsteps, and grate wuz the mix, but profitable. But my dreem is bustid. The nigger is free, and demands wages for the work uv his hands. His wife is free, and she kin decide whether she 'll cleave to her husband, or be my conkebine. Yisterday I bade her come to me, and, lo! she remarkt, “Go 'way, white man, or I 'll bust yer hed.” And I gode. Her childern are free—they are mine, likewise, but I can't sell em on the block, to the highest bidder. Therein Linkin sinned—he violatid the holiest and highest instinks uv our nacher; he interposed a proclamashen atween father and child. We took the heathen from Afreka, and wuz a makin Christians uv em. Wo to him who stopt us in our mishnary work. It is written—“Kin the Ethiope change his skin?” I wuz a changin it for him, I and my fathers, and we hed mellerd it down to a brite yaller. Dark is my fucher. I obeyed the grate law uv labor, ez I served in the army, by substitoot. Now shel I hev to stane my hands with labor, or starve. In what am I better than a Northern mudsill? I kin git no more dimund pins for the wife uv my buzm, and she yawpeth continyooaly. Arrayd in hum-spun, she wrastles with pots and kettles in the kitchen. Weighed down with wo, she dips snuff in silence. She asks uv me comfort—wat kin I say, whose pockits contane only Confedrit skrip? Save us from Massychusits, wich is ornery and cussid. Protect us from nigger soljers, wich is grinnin feends. Shelter us from the ghost uv John Brown, wich is marchin on. Petroleum V. Nasby, Lait Paster uv the Church uv the Noo Dispensashun.</field>

Methawt I wuz decently deceest, hed bin genteelly buried, and a toom-stun, on wich wuz inscribed enuff virchoos to furnish a dozen saints, hed bin erected to my memry. I blusht a sperit blush when I red that stun, and diskiverd what a eggsemplary man I hed bin. Likewise, a auction wuz made uv my estate, wich wuz incloodid in a red bandanner trunk. My sperit hed ascendid, and I wuz at the outer gate uv heven, knockin for admittance. The season hed bin a pekooliarly helthy wun, and ez the doorkeeper hed n't much to do, while my case wuz bein decidid on, I amoozed myself ascertainin the wherabouts uv my old acquaintances who hed deceast doorin the past ten yeers. “Got enny quantity uv my old frends up here?” sez I, inquirinly. “Not menny,” sez he. “Deekin Smathers is here, I spose?” sez I. “Not enny,” sez he. “Why,” sez I, “the deekin wuz the heftiest man we hed at a prayer, and no deekin cood be more zelus in keepin the congregashun strate.” “Troo,” sed he, “but, alars! the deekin kept his eagle-eye fixt so intently on his naber's feet, that his own got off the road, and when he pulled up, 't want at the place he calkilatid on. His prayers wuz pleasin, but ez they was n't backed up by DOIN things in proportion, they did n't pass current up here.” “How about Elder Black? He wuz a charitable soul—no man give more to the poor than him.” “The elder give away much money, but it did n't do him no good. The trooth is, the elder, in his younger days, made up his mind to git rich and be a good man both. He 'd give a widder 22 a ten-dollar note, and to make it up wood charge a workman that amount for tools broken in his servis. He 'd swindle his naber out uv his eye-teeth in wat yoo call biznis, down below, and compromise with his religion by subscribin one-tenth uv the profits to a mishnary society. Compermisin don't work in religion—the compermiser gives to the devil suthin uv valyoo, and reseeves in return that wich damns him. His swindlins and cheatins and oppressions wuz eggsakly balanst, in number, by his charities; but, ez he died wuth a half a million, the swindlin side wuz the heaviest in quality. We keep books very akerit, up here.” “Wher is good sister Muckum? She 's all rite, anyhow.” “Considrably not. The old lady bleevd in the doctrin uv eleckshun, to-wit: that she wuz elected 2 be saved, and evry body else wuz elected to be damned. She used to confess, in her prayers, that she wuz a poor, mizable sinner, but she did n't bleeve a word uv it. She meant her nabers, all the time.” “Deekin Kitt is”— “No he is n't. His nose wuz too red. The lessons he used to give his fellows on the subgeck uv temprance, et settry, he never practist hisself, He hed a favorit door, and behint that door he sucked—not a honest suck—he tride to deseeve hisself. He loved sperits, but he spent fifteen yeers a tryin faithfully to convince hisself that he hed dispepsy, and needed whisky, reglar, to keep him up. He fooled hisself down there, but up here it 's another thing.” “Sister Swan, who writ them speritooal hims that wuz sung in all the Churches. Sich piety ez prodoost them effoosions must be safe.” “Agin wrong. Sister Swan writ beautiful hims; but, my deer sir, she never felt them sentimence. She wuz burnt up with a itchin after fame, and sich, and writin speritooal hims happened to be her best holt. Ef she 'd a knack uv writin comik songs, she 'd hev writ em.

Yoo can't offset starvin servant girls with writin speritooal hims, enny more than yoo kin make speritooal hims take place uv the bred and taters they ought to hev.” “Squire McShinnegan”— “Jined the Church to keep hisself bein continooally Squire.” “Bibney, the merchant”— “Kep inside the pale uv the Church for trade, but his body wuz all that wuz inside, and that jumpt out every time he went to Noo York.

Ther wuz wunst a doctor who hed a pashent he wuz a physikin. While the physik wuz a workin, he changed his mind and administerd a vomick. The pashent's stumick wuz in wat mite be cald a dilemmer. The physik wuz a pullin down, the vomick wuz a pullin up, and the poor bowels, undecided wich to foller, allowed the diseese to fasten itself, when either wood hev expelled it. The pashent died, and I am happy to state that his estate wuz insolvent, and the ijeotik physician did n't git his bill. Jest so. Dimokrasy got the stumick-ake when the war commenst. Fernandywood administerd the peace-puke, and Micklellan dosed it with war-physick. The pashent is neerly ded, and neither doctor will get rich out uv the assets. I notice all over the North, Dimekratik convenshuns are nominatin returned soljers for offis, wherever they kin ketch one who will accept, and ther 's but little trouble, for in every county ther 's orfisers who went in2 the servis becoz uv pay, who Ablishnized theirselves for continyooance, and who 'll flop back to us on the most reasonable terms. I hev persnel motives for objectin. Last winter these demons were to home on furlo. Twenty uv em cum to my peeseful dwellin, at the ded hour uv nite, ceased my venrable form and dragged me 4th. They made me kneel into the cold snow, on my nakid knees, and with one hand upliftid, and my shirt-tale a wavin in the wind, they made me take the oath, and drink a pint uv water. The oath give me inflammashen uv the brane, and the water inflammashen uv the bowels, and for six weeks I lay, a ravin maniac. I cood overlook this, for the Dimekrat who woodent sacrifice his agid grandmother for the party, is unworthy the name; but I object to nominatin them, for the follerin reasons also: 1. Taint honist. In 1862 I called the soljers “Linkin purps,” and the orfisers “sholder-strapt hirelins,” and I meant it. They wuz wagin a crooil and unholy war agin Dimokrasy; they wuz redoosin our magorities in the Suthern Staits at the rate uv sum hundreds per day, and now to nominate them, is a flop I 'll never make. 2. 'T won't pay. These fellers sold us out when they took commishns; they sold out the Ablishnists when they flopt back to us, and what guaranty hev we that they wont sell us out, the next turn uv the wheel? Ef we cood git sum decent wuns it mite do; but, good Lord! the soljer who wood do this wood be lower down than we is, wich wood bother a man. All the votes that sich men cood controle, we hev alluz owned in fee-simple. 3. Taint justis 2 us originel Copperheds. We endoored the heat and burden uv the day; we resistid drafts; we damned taxes; we wuz Fort Lafayeted and Fort Warined; 'twas us who died in our door-yards. Wher wuz these orfisers then? All the damage they dun the guverment wuz in drawin pay and rashens. 4. The reconstructid Dimokrasy uv the South won't like it, and to them, after all, we must look for success. 5. They acknowledged nigger equality, by allowin niggers to fite with em. 6. We hev gone too fur to try the soljer-dodge. We opposed the war; we opposed ther votin; we opposed the Ablishn in votin pay and supplies, we opposed aid societies, and laft at sanitary commishns; we opposed drafts at a time when they needed help; and to go back on sich a record is ruther renchin, and I won't do it. 7. Ef we undertake the soljer, we commit ourselves to payin his penshuns, et settry. How wood the Suthern Dimokrasy like that? 8. Ef we nominate men who servd, we disgust the deserters and them ez went to Canady for the sake uv the coz. We hev cappytle enuff in the nigger. Let us plant ourselves boldly on shoor ground. Let us resolve that Goddelmity wuz rite in makin the nigger our slave, tho he made a mistake in implantin in his heevin buzm a cronic desire to run away from his normal condishn. Let us hang out our banner, and inscribe on its folds, “No marryin niggers!” “No payin a debt inkurd in a nigger war!” “Protect us from nigger equality!” and sich other precepts ez cum within range uv the Dimekratik intellek, and go in and win.

I will let him stay, and to-morrer I 'll hist Nip, my tarrier, in, and it 'll be hunky fun 2 see him kill him.” Upon wich, with a sardonic grin orespredin his utherwise intellektooal countenanse, he strode hawtily away.

His wife begged him to go on, and not let so important a sekrit die with him. “Shet up,” retorts he, in his anshent way; “ef this rane holds out long enuff, I 'm ez good ez a dozen ded rats.” Shoor enuff, it did rane till the cistern wuz full, the rat menetime flotin comfortably on the shingle.

I am certin uv a greater measure uv success; for, while all people hev bowels, mighty few hev minds, and ez a rool, the more bowels the less mind. Anticipatin this catastrophe, I hev already prepared my advertisements.

Applied remedy, ez per instructions, to end uv stump. Next mornin stump hed grown 18 inches. In three days it wuz ez long ez tother leg, and the foot hed formed. Put on a boot on the mornin uv the 4th day. At noon, the growin foot bustid it, and by nite the leg wuz ten inches longer than the other. At last accounts the leg wuz still growin. P.

Case 3824.—Mary M'Guire, widow with nine small children. Sent stamps and receivd receet. Cut her oldest girl's arm to the bone to try it. Applied and healed in 30 minits. An idee struck her.

Wat smilin babes hev bornded in that time, who hev sence growd up, good and bad men and wimen! Wat brite hopes hev sprung up that hev bin blighted by disappintment! Wat— But what 's the yoose uv moralizin? Ez I set a smokin my evenin pipe, memry went back forty yeers, and a insident that okkurred at that time cum forsibly to my mind. I wuz then a dotin youth, who indulged in brite-colored weskets, and invested heavy in hair-oil. My hart wuz a peece uv tinder, wich a glance from ary femenine eye, uv not over 30 yeers, wood fire, and which spark a sigh wood fan into a glowin flame. I wuz susceptible. Near my paternal ancestor's roof resided a farmer, who hed but one child and a smashin farm. This child wuz a girl, who wuz ez pretty ez a Wenus, and who knew it, and who also knew that when that old hard-hitter, Death, shood send her parents to grass, she wood cum in for “A very large forchune in silver and gold,” ez the poet hez it. Consequently she wuz ez skittish ez a yeerlin colt with a chestnut-burr under its tail, and made no more akkount uv the hearts and affections uv the young men than ez tho they wuz so many apple-dumplins. She flirted with all uv em, and played her keerds so skillfully that every one uv em, within a circuit uv five miles, honestly expected to marry her. Two uv em were speshelly infatooatid, myself and Eb Brown, for she hed promised to marry us both. She told us, (separately, uv coarse,) that the only obstikle wuz that we were too poor to git the old man's consent, and insistid on our waitin till we hed made our pile. To a hungry man a hour is a long time to wait for dinner—to two fools, ded in love, the time wasted to git the pile nessary to matrimony, is a age. There wuz at that time oceans uv money bein made a cuttin live-oak, in Floridy, and one 24 mornin Eb cum to me and asked me how I wood like to go with him and make our forchunes in that biznis. I spozd he wuz actooated by a mere desire to make money. I, filled full uv love, jumpd at the proposition, and in a week we were on the way. In doo time we arrived, and without loss uv time we set to work. Inspired by love, wich is a considerably stronger motive-power than a 500 horse-power engine, we waded in. Night and day we toiled, and instid uv the fine, free, open-harted fellers we wuz at hum, we bekum two uv the closest-fisted cusses in Floridy. There wuz no whisky—no terbacker—no poker—none uv the comforts uv life for us. One Sunday, after hevin washt up our red shirts, and sowed on all the buttons, etc., I happened to enquire uv Eb why he cum to sich a God-forsaken country. To wunst he replied—that he might make money, go back, and marry the objek uv his adorashen. “Them 's my fix,” shoutid I, and we immejitly shook hands and vowed eternal friendship. “Yes,” sez Eb, “how pleasant 't will be! In one short year we 'll hev made our spondoolix and we 'll go back. Yoo 'll marry yoor gal; I 'll marry Looizer, and”— “Looizer!” shreekt I, seezin him by the throte, “Looizer who?” “Why, Looizer Bevins; who else?” “Good Lord!” gasped I, my face the color uv unbleeched muslin; “she 's the Looizer I 'm workin for.” We understood each other. Risin to our feet, we looked at each other eggsackly ez eminent young Amerikin tragedians do when they wish to express hate, rage, skorn, contempt, loathing, et settry. A ijee struck me. Cood I only git home fust! Hastily gatherin my valyooables, I sprung onto the mule we owned in company, and afore Eb knew what I wuz about, wuz a mile on my way to the neerest seaport. It finelly okkurrin to him wat my stratejy wuz, he promptly stole another mule and follered. A vessel wuz on the pint uv sailin; we embarked together, and together landed in Noo York. Twict, on the passage, I attempted to fling him overboard, but wuz each time frustrated by his sooperior strength, and wuz only saved myself from findin a watry grave, by the interference uv the crew. At Noo York we took the river, and at Albany the canal, and finelly cum to the neerest town to our respective place uv abode. Without waitin to look after baggage, we rusht to a livery stable, and in a few minits two teams mite hev bin seen tearin over the pike toards Looizer's. We drawd near the house. It wuz at 9 P. M. With strange forebodins we saw the venerable mansion brilliantly illoominatid—there wuz indikashens uv suthin. Flingin ourselves from the vehicles, we rusht to the door, opened it, and— On the floor stood a beautiful maiden in white; by her side a young man in black; in front a clergyman, who wuz pronouncin these words: “Whom God hez jined together, let no man put asunder,” er suthin to that effeck. Need I say that the maiden in white arrayed wuz Looizer? Need I relate how we went back together, and together in the glades uv Floridy strove to pour ile into each other's lasseratid harts?

      <field name="fulltext">CIX. ON THE DIVERSITY OF THE RACES. Saint's Rest, (wich is in the Stait uv Noo Gersey,) } September the 24th, 1865. Whenever yoo ask the people to adopt any given line uv ackshen, yoo hev got to give em a tolable good reason therefor. Troo, this never hez bin so nessary in the Dimekratik party, whose members hev alluz follered their leeders, without askin the why or wherefore, with a fidelity beautiful to behold. But people, ginrally, are inquisitive, and wun reason why we hev never succeeded with the slavery question, is becoz we never hev yet given a good reason why the nigger shood be held in slavery. Wunst it wuz sought to be defended on the ground that the nigger wuz inferior to the white man, but it woodent do. Why? Becoz the full-blown Dimekrat thot to hisself to wunst, “Ef the stronger shel own the weaker—ef the intellectooally sooperior shel hold in slavery the intellectooally inferior, Lord help me! Why, I might ez well go into a Ablishn township and select my master to wunst.” The same argument won't do ez to nigger equality. Why shood we say that the nigger shan't vote, on the skore uv his not bein fitted by eddicashen or intelligence, when the fust and cheefest qualificashen uv a strate Dimekrat is his not knowin how to read? Why, to-day, in my county, ef a Dimekrat kin rite his name without runnin his tongue out, we alluz refooze to elect him a delegate in the county convenshun. It exposes him to the suspishun uv knowin too much. I hev quit all these shaller dodges, long ago. We must hev the nigger, for jest at this time there ain't no uther cappitle for us to run on; but he must be put on maintainable ground. I put my foot on him, on the ground uv the DIVERSITY UV THE RACES! He is not wun uv us. He is not a descendant uv Adam. Goddlemity probably made him, ez he did the ox, and the ass, and the dorg, and the babboon, but not at the same time, nor for the same purposes. He is not, in enny sence uv the word, a MAN! His kulor is diffrent, the size uv his head is diffrent, his foot is longer, and his hand is bigger. He wuz created a beast, and the fiat uv the Almity give us dominion over him, the same ez over other beasts. Does the theologian say that this doctrine undermines the Christian religion? I to wunst reply, that that don't matter to us. Dimokrasy and religion shook hands and bid each other a affekshunate farewell, years ago. Uv what comparison is religion to a Dimekratik triumph? Doth the ethnologist say that the diffrence atween the Caucassian and Afrikin is no greater than atween the Caucassian and Mongolian? I anser to wunst that he is rite—that the Mongolian is likewise a beest; becoz, don't yoo see there ain't no Mongolians in this seckshun uv country to disprove it. Doth the Ablishnist pint to a nigger who kin read and rite, and figure through to division, and in sich other partickelers show hisself sooperior to the majority uv Dimekrats? I alluz draw myself up to my full hite, assoom a virchusly indignant look, and exclaim, “He 's nuthin but a d—d nigger, anyhow!” wich is the only effective argument we hev hed for ten years. Doth the besotted nigger-lover pint to the mulatter, and say, “What will yoo do with him, who is half beest and half man, who hez half a sole that is to be saved—for one-half uv whom Christ died?” I anser at wunst, that I don't deal in abstrackshuns, and git out ez soon ez possible, for there is a weak pint there, that I hevent ez yit bin able to git over. This wun weak pint is no argument agin my theory, for happy is the Dimekrat who kin propound a theory that hezent a skore, instid uv wun, weak places in it. This doctrine kivers the whole ground. Ef the nigger is a beest, Dimekrats hev a good excuse for not givin to mishnary sosieties, for uv what use is it to undertake to Christianize beests, who hev no soles to save and no intrest in the blood uv Christ? It gives us a perfek rite to re-establish slavery, for doth not Blackstun, who wuz supposed to know ez much law ez a Noo Gersey justis uv the peece, say that we hev a rite to ketch and tame the wild beest, and bend him to our uses? Also, he can't vote; for wood the lowest white man consent to vote alongside uv a beest, even ef he did walk on 2 legs? Not enny.

      <field name="fulltext">CXI. ON SOUTHERN CHARACTER. Saint's Rest, (wich is in the Stait uv Noo Gersey, } September the 23d, 1865. The world is, and alluz hez bin, full uv deloosions. A lie, well started, viggerously stuck to, and energetically pushed, ansers jest ez well ez the trooth, and will live a long time. I hev lived in this world uv desepshun long enuff to diskiver that there is a huge diffrence betwixt the real and the ideal. For instance. In my youth I wuz given to reedin Cooper's novels, until, becomin infatuated with his descriptions uv the Injin stile uv livin, and the granjer uv the Injin charikter, I determined to jine a tribe, and adopt their habits. I imagined myself a noble red man uv the forest, a chasin the wild deer all the day, thro the leafy wood, and sweetly sleepin at nite in a leafy bower, never wunst thinkin uv the friteful colds I 'd ketch sleepin out uv doors, and uv the terrible consekences uv a purely animal diet upon my uneddikatid bowils. Filled with these ijees, I made my way to the neerest reservation, and the fust noble red man uv the forest I saw, wuz asleep under a tree, with a bottle beside him. I awakened him, and addressed him in the language uv the novels, wich I sposed wuz all he cood understand, thus: “Why slumbereth the cheef uv the Pocasokes? and why are not his feet upon the war-path? The skelp uv his father hangs in the lodge uv Skinewaugh, and his death is unavenged! Awake!” The noble Injin rolled over lazily on one elbow, took a long pull at his bottle, ejackelatin: “Ugh! go way. White man dam fool—gimme dime—buy Injin more rum!” and sank back into his inebriatid slumber. Hevin seen the ginooine Injin ez he exists out uv the novels, I did not jine that tribe. I yoosed to bleeve in Southern shivelry. Likewise did I bleeve in Robinson Croosoe, the malestrom, and Jackson's cotton-bales; but, ezI afterwards diskivered, there wuz no reality in these, so I wuz prepared to bleeve the shivelry uv the South wuz a good part bottled moonshine. Wunst, to me, the Sutherner wuz a compound uv George IV, Shevaleer Bayard, Humbolt, and Longfeller, possessin the deportment uv the fust, the high-grade shivelry and manly phisikle perfekshun uv the sekond, the learnin uv the third, and the deep poetic feelin uv the fourth. I sposed he wood interdoose his knife into the bowils uv his enemy with the fearlessness and dexterity uv Bayard, apologize with the calm grace uv George, and write his obitchuary like Longfeller, in the stile uv Hiawatha. I bleeved his residence wuz a manshun, his common bevrage the rosiest kind uv wine, quaffed from the most costly goblets; that money with him wuz a matter uv no account; that his time wuz divided between his country, his books, and manly out-door sports. In war, my notion uv him wuz a cross between Achilles and Wellington, I givin him the credit uv hevin the dash uv the one, the steadiness uv tother, and the heroism uv both. Sich wuz my ijee uv the Suthern gentleman. Wood, O wood that this pleasin deloosion hed never bin dissipatid! It 's the nacher uv the Northern Dimekrat to look up 2 sumboddy, and I did n't like the ijee uv hevin my idol dismountid. I wuz down South doorin the war, hevin served sevral months in the Loozeaner Pelicans, a Confedrit regiment, made up uv the fust families uv that Stait. I found that I hed bin labrin under a deloosion all my life. I wuz in Virginia a while, where yoo are supposed to find the highest type uv Suthern shivelry. On a average the Virginian is as mizable a cuss ez ther is on earth. His manshun is a shamblin cabin; his rosy wine is a stile uv potato whisky, so inexpressibly mean that it wood be rejected with inexpressible skorn by the most reckless and abandoned squaw; his costly goblet is a stun jug with a cob stopper, and his highest ijee uv amoosement is quarter races and poker. Long, lank, lathy, low-browed, peak-nosed, he approaches the appearance uv the Northerner about ez closely ez a ring-tailed babboon resembles Powers' Greek Slave. In war he haint no better than in peece. He fites well enuff when put to it, but he haint no endoorence. Ef he don't win from the start, his game is up. And the less he intends to do, the more he blows afore he commences. His endlis blowin about his fitin capasity and resources, afore the war, wuz wat roped us Northern Dimekrats into it, and indoost us to stake our politikle fucher on their success. Alars! we wuz fooled in em, and we go down with em. I never want to hear a word agin about Suthern shivelry. We hev got to git em back agin, for alone we kin do nothin, and I spose when we hev em back, we 'll hev to knuckle to em jist ez we did afore the war, for they comprise the heft uv the party; but we 'll do it this time for policy, while before we did it from sheer belief in their sooperiority over us. I 'd be well satisfied ef we cood git along, ez a party, without em. Petroleum V. Nasby, Lait Paster uv the Church uv the Noo Dispensashun.</field>

Skarcely hed I sunk into slumber, when my viggerus intellek, wich even the bonds uv slumber can't chain, wandered away into the misty realms uv speckelashen. I hed the most horrible vision that ever afflicted a sleepin man, wich the bare recollekshun uv, causes a involuntary shudder to thrill my susceptible frame. Methawt a epidemic startid in Afrika, and cum by reglar steps through Europe, and finally reeched Noo York. For a time it raged alike among all classes uv people, and among all colors and complexions. The proud and hawty Caucassian, the bold and patriotic Celt, the noble red man uv the forest, (wich is pizen,) all, all, wuz swept away by the relentless pestilence. Finally, it abated. The white man and the red man begun to escape the fangs uv death; but among the niggers it raged wuss than ever. Thro the South it swept like a tornado, sparin the whites, but cuttin down every nigger in its path. Ther wuz weepin and wailin. The hawty planter saw in his nigger-quarters the brite octoroon, for whom he hed paid ?2500, and who hed solaced his hours uv relaxashen with her charms—who hed bore him girls almost perfekly white, wich, on akkount uv hevin his blood in their vanes, he hed been able to sell for ?3000 and ?4000 to other planters, whose tastes run in that direckshun—he saw her, the objeck uv his affeckshun, and a part uv his estate, lyin a inanymait corpse, not worth a cent for any purpose. Likewise he saw his robust feeld-hands, each wun with sinews and muscles uv iron—the males harty and sound, without blemish; the females capable uv raisin a picanniny wich wuz worth ?200 ez soon ez weened, wunst a year, and by a little extra whippin do a year's work in the feeld every 12 months, stretched cold corpses in the feeld, the cotton unpicked, and his last year's gamblin debts unpaid. Thus wuz disease out rajin all the finer feelins uv humanity, and destroyin relentlessly all that made life pleasant and lovely. Finally, nigger after nigger fell, until but two remained in the Yoonited States. They wuz a male and female, uv sich perfekly helthy systems, that it seemed impossible for disease to tetch them. When the epidemic wuz known to hev settled down to niggers alone, the Dimokrasy held a consultation, and fearin the race wood becum extinct, hed selected these, hed carefully sekloodid em from the world, and hed employed twenty-four uv the most eminent medikle men uv the world, to be with em constantly—each stayin an hour—that, in case they showd eny symptoms, 25 the proper remedies mite be to wunst applide, afore the disease got a hold. From these two, ef the rest wuz destroyed, it wuz hoped a new stock cood be raised, that the dangers uv negro equality mite be still kept afore the Amerikin people. But all to no purpus. The unsparin pestilence smoted em, and, notwithstandin the efforts made by the eminent physicians — notwithstandin the prayers and groans uv the Dimokrasy — they died! Methawt the heavens wuz hung in black, and ominus litenins shot athwart the skies. In the distants low, mutrin thunders wuz heard, and the beests uv the forests run affrighted from their coverts. Dray hosses dropt dead in the streets; dorgs run wildly, with their tongues a hangin out, and the white foam droppin from their distendid jaws. Ever and anon, pale, sickly gleams uv lite flashed across the dark, leaden-colored clouds, givin nacher the appearance uv labrin under a severe attack uv yaller janders. The last nigger wuz dead! Presently, the leaders uv the Dimokrasy begun to assemble. Fernandywood cum. “Alars!” sez he, sobbin ez tho his hart wood break, and kissin the cold corpse—“Farewell, my hopes—a long and larst farewell! Thou wust our corner-stun; on thee we built. Thou wust our cappitle, our cheefest trust. We used yoo—we aboozed yoo—and in aboozin yoo found our profit. Yoo wuz ordained to be the cuss uv Ameriky—we wuz ordained to be alluz fearful uv yoor bein our sooperior—to us wuz entrusted the deliteful task uv keepin yoo down, and us over yoo. Our task is ended with thee. Kin we any more rally our people to the poles, by yawpin the dangers uv nigger equality, when ther ain't no nigger? This, now, is a white man's guverment—we hev nuthin left to contend for, and thus I foller thee.” And Fernandy, who hed found a jack-knife in the nigger's vest-pockit, run it into his bowils, and fell a dead corpse across his body. Franklin Peerse approached and wailed thus: “And art thou gone, last uv the Afrikins? Cood not the avengin ministers uv death hev taken sum other race? Cood not the noble Injin bin taken, and thou spared to Demokrasy? No white man feered his supremacy. Cood not the Chinese hev bin sacrificed in thy stead? The people hed no prejoodis agin his color. Thou wust all that made me uv yoose, and ez thou art gone, so I go also.” And takin the jack-knife out uv Fernandy's hand, he stabbed hisself with it, and fell dead atop uv Fernandy. Vallandigum approached, weepin vilently. “Opposin thy elevation,” sed he, addressin the dead nigger, “wunst made a marter uv me, wich marterdom netted me ?30,000 in ten-cent pieces, wich I immejitly invested in 7-30 bonds issued by a tyranikle and onconstooshnal guverment. By carryin a portrait uv thee, and exhibitin it at my meetins in the rooral deestricks, I hev made my constitooencies bile with rage, at the ijee uv sich ez thou bein elevatid to their speer. Like Othello, `my okkepashun's gone.' Farewell, pollytix— thou wast my pollytix. Farewell, Congris!—uv wat yoose is a Dimekrat in Congris with no nigger to blat about? Farewell, life!—for wat is life with no nigger to persekoot?” And takin the jack-knife from Peerse's hand, he recklessly plunged it into his bowils, and fell across Peerse. Brite, uv Injeany; Richardson, uv Illinoy; Seymour, uv Noo York; Florence, uv Pennsilvany, and all the leeders uv the party uv the North, without exception, cum up, and, makin similar orashuns, used the jack-knife in like style—fallin across each other ez four-foot wood is corded. Ginral Slocum, uv Noo York, hed a good mind to do the same thing; but he conclooded he cood turn a somerset out uv the party ez easy ez he somersetted into it, and he did n't. Filled with anguish uv the heaviest descripshun, and fully appreciatin the feelins uv the noble men who woodent survive their party, I caught the jack-knife, and, throwin myself into a attitood—sich ez I hev seen Forist cum, when, in Otheller, he stabs hisself—I wuz on the pint uv makin it acqwaintid with my intestines, when I happened to observe a quart-bottle stickin out uv the nigger's coat-pockit. Droppin the knife, I seezed it, and in 2 gulps swallered the contents. The room spun round and round, and, eggsaustid, I fell senseless across the dead sooisides. Jest then, Horis Greely entered the room. Holdin up both hands, he exclaimed: “Ez it wuz in the beginnin, so it is in the endin. Behold Dimokrasy!—nigger at the bottom, and whisky at the top. We 're rid uv two great cusses to wunst!” And, instid uv punchin his stumick with the knife, he shuffled out uv the room, holdin his nose. I awoke, in a feverish sweat, shreekin wildly. So vivid wuz the scene I hed dreemed, that I found it impossible to sleep, and all that long nite I walked the flore in agony. Wuz the dreem profetik? Is there any danger uv the nigger becumin extinct by disease? I know amalgamashun is whitenin him in the Suthern States, but up North, where Dimokrasy is skarse, we kin preserve them in all their original blackness. Hevin grant that this friteful vision wuz simply the result uv a disordered stumick, and not a warnin uv wrath to cum! Petroleum V. Nasby, Lait Paster uv the Church uv the Noo Dispensashun.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CXIII. HAS A CONVERSATION WITH THE DEVIL. Saint's Rest, (wich is in the Stait uv Noo Gersey,) } September the 30th, 1865. Nite afore last, I wuz at a gathrin uv the faithful, in the next town to Saint's Rest, and wuz a comin back on the nite train uv the Camden and Amboy, wich is the beauty and glory uv Noo Gersey. I wuz somewat elewatid, hevin hed a need uv inspirin flooids, there bein two or three returned soljers in the meetin, who kept a provokin me with irrelevant and irritatin remarks, sich ez pullin me orf the stand, and pintin revolvers at me. When the conductor cum around, I told him that I wuz a humble worker in the grate feeld uv Dimekratik reform, and wuz, uv coarse, without funds, and that I expected to be passed to my home, FREE! The poor man wuz thunder-struck! Staggerin aginst the side uv the car, pale ez a ghost, and speechless, he beckoned to a brakesman, and pinted me out. In a instant I wuz seezed and bundled out uv the car. The next mornin I saw the incident noticed in the daily papers, under the follerin hed lines: “THE BULWORKS UV SOCIETY A BRAKIN AWAY!” “NOO GERSEY IN DANGER!” “A FEEND DEMANDS TO BE DED-HEDED OVER THE CAMDEN AND AMBOY!” “PROMT AND HEROIC ACTION UV THE CONDUCTOR!” “HIS SALRY RAISED BY THE COMPNY!” How long I lay alongside uv the track I know not; but conshusnis returnin, I saw, sittin on the fence, the figure uv Satan hisself. “Avant!” cried I. “Why comest thou to torment me afore my time?” “Do n't skeer,” sez he; “I do n't want yoo yet. Remember the old man's remark: `Why shood men club apples orf uv trees, when, ef they let em alone, they will fall orf themselves?' I woodent take the trouble to cum after yoo, and sich ez yoo. I often take a toor thro Gersey. It 's my best harvist-field. I 'm pleasurin now.” Reassured, I asked the old gentleman sum questions as to what kind uv biznis he wuz a doin these times, et settry. He replied that biznis wuz good. The Suthern States hed bin his grate feeld uv labor, and when they rebelled agin the guverment he thot he hed ded wood on them localities. His sole expanded with goy ez he saw the Churches South plunge into the seceshn biznis, and their preechers throw orf the sackerdotle robes and put on butternut uniform. They never hed much religion down there, anyhow; but when they went into seceshn, they threw away that little. “Ez Linkin's helyuns advanst,” he sed, “my sole shrunk—only occasionally wuz I elewatid ez yoo Copperheds riz in the North. Finally, when Lee and Johnson surrendered, I give up all hopes. That, I thot, settled the question. The niggers will be emancipated and I 'll lose them, for they 'll larn to read, and they 'll diskiver that virchoo is the best road to travel. Also”— “Hold!” sez I, “do niggers go to hell?” “Uv coarse, when they die in their sins,” sez he. “Farewell, hope!” exclaims I, in agony, “for all is lost! At the last end the entire Dimokrasy will be on a equality with the nigger, and will hev to mix with em.” “Also,” sez he, a goin on, “I wuz satisfied I shood lose the whites South, for when they can't live on nigger labor and hev to go to work, they won't hev time to gamble nor drink. They won't hev ?2500 to pay for pretty octoroons, and, per consequence, one uv the commandments will be better observed. So I wuz lo-sperited, and conclooded that the Almity had taken that part uv the country out uv my hands.” “How, then,” sez I, “is it that yoo feel so well to-night?” “For two reasons,” sez he. “I alluz feel at home in Noo Gersey; and besides that, things don't look so bad after all. You folks up North are doin things to soot me, and so they are South. Uv what account is Linkin's proclamashen, when sich men ez now controle the South, are in power? Them Sutherners are men I like. Guvner Perry talks uv `Radikle Republikins,' wich shows he 's bound 2 make head agin the only enemies I ever hed in the North. The nigger is free, but only in name. That blessid doctrine uv Stait Rites allows eech wun uv the Staits to oppress jist which class they please, and ez the North will certinly pass all sorts uv laws agin their escapin in that direcshun, it seems to me ez tho Cuff wuz between the upper and nether mill-stun, after all. Five dollars a month they will agree to pay him, but that he 'll never git. Then follers steelins, and stabbins, and shootins, and hangins, and arsons, and insurrections, [here he rubbed his hands,] and more sich fun than we ever saw. Then when the South gets strong agin, and they and yoo, yoonited, make a majority in Congris, won't them Yankees git? Won't we (I speek uv yoo Northern Dimekrats and the South and me, wich hez alluz bin pardners,) make the North pay the Suthern war debt? Won't we re-establish slavery in the South and extend it over all the territories, and finally over all the Northern Staits, makin it yooniversal? I rather think so. Ef the North refoozes, then agin yoo and the South and I will make another war, and that time we 'll succeed, for we 'll know how, better, and the guverment overthrode, we 'll fix it jist ez we want it. And then”— At this pint he threw his left arm about my neck in a extacy uv irrepressible love. It scorched ez tho a hot bar uv iron hed bin twisted around me, and, shreekin with agony—I awoke. It wuz only a dreem, and I found myself a lyin in the identikle ditch in2 wich I hed fallen when the conductor threw me orf the trane. I cood not help wondrin at the correctnis with wich my visitor guessed the purposes uv our party. Petroleum V. Nasby, Lait Paster uv the Church uv the Noo Dispensashun.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CXIV. APPEAL TO THE DEMOCRACY. Saint's Rest, (wich is in the Stait uv Noo Gersey,) } October the 4th, 1865. Dimekrats uv the North! Yoo hev to deside whether the old party, which hez alluz delited in managin the affairs uv this guvernment, is to agin assoom its nateral position, or whether it is doomed to die, and be among the things that wuz. Ez the hed uv the party, I issue this appeal. The time for argument hez passed—all that now remains is ackshen! ackshen!! ackshen!!! Never before wuz there sich need uv work— never wuz there so much at stake. Look around yoo, fellow Dimekrats! See! Uv all the Staits North, only Noo Gersey remains troo to her anshent prinsipples. The dark waves uv Ablishnism are a sweepin over the land, unchecked, save by Noo Gersey. There, thank God, the ark uv the convant rests. There the vestal fires burn brightly. Noo Gersey hez the Dimokrasy she alluz hed—she changes not. Ever sence the yeer before the Revolushen, she hez bin Dimekratik. No matter wat issues wuz presented—no matter on wich side uv sed issues the Dimokrasy planted theirselves, Noo Gersey alluz voted that ticket. Sech confidin trust in the leaders, sech Roman simplicity, is refreshin. Wood, O wood that we hed more Noo Gerseys! This fall the Dimokrasy hev exceeded theirselves in liberality to the people. Never wuz there sich a assortment uv principles to choose from. In Noo York, we hev on the track a Ginral, who sheathed his sword in the harts uv his Suthern brethrin, and him we stood on a platform which recognizes the death uv slavery, and feels good over it, and wich goes for payin the debt, intrest, principle, and all. In Noo Gersey we hev a Ginral on the ticket who run away from Bull Run, becoz he did n't approve uv the principles on wich the war wuz bein condukted, on a platform ez strikly Suthern ez the Camden and Amboy cood make it. In Ohio, our platform wuz made by the great Vallandigum, and in it is the pure expressed joose uv Dimokrasy. The great doctrine uv Staits Rites is avowed, and the rite uv the seceded Staits to agin secede is upheld. Here is diversity—here is pickin. Each Dimekrat kin pick wich set uv prinsipples he desires, and the cheerman uv his central committy will cheerfully certify that that set will be made universal, ez soon ez a Nashnel Convenshun convenes. Look at wat intrests are at stake. Do yoo want to marry nigger wenches? Do yoo want yoor gushin daughters tied by indissoluble ties to disgustin buck niggers? We hev persistently petitioned Abolishn legislachers to pass acts preventin us from doin this foul thing, but to no avale. They hev turned a deef ear to our entreaties, and to-day we stand exposed to all these dangers. Do yoo want a buck nigger to march up to the poles with yoo to vote? Do yoo want their children mixt with yoors in skools? Do yoo want em on juries and holdin offis in yoor township? My God! think uv it! Think uv yoor bein brot up on a charge uv petty larceny, sich ez steelin sheep or chickens, before a nigger justis uv the peese! Think uv yoor bein sood for a store-bill that hed run ten yeers, afore a nigger squire! In the towns and cities, think uv bein arrestid for bein drunk, by a nigger policeman, and bein arraned in the mornin before a nigger mayor! Contemplate these pikters without a shudder, ef yoo kin. These questions must be met. They stare us in the face. On yoo depends the issue. The nigger is our natral enemy. Sum uv our best lites are in favor uv givin him the suffrage, on the ground that in a little while we wood git his votes, on the prinsipple that we ketch all the trash naterally. My frends, be not deseeved. We hev aboozed the nigger so long and so persistently, that it wood take ages afore we cood get him suffishently demoralized to act with us, and afore that time we wood all be in the silent grave, where pollytix is uv no akkount. On the question uv taxes, and reconstruction, and sich, I refer yoo to the platforms adoptid by yoor various Stait Convenshuns; yoo may depend upon eech bein perfeckly sound. On these minor questions there may be diffrense uv opinion in localities; but, thank Hevin, on nigger there is unanimity. “Nigger and him prostrated,” is the rallyin cry uv the Dimokrasy, North, South, East, and West. I bleeve in the above I hev given a full epitome uv the principles uv the party. We hev a he old fight afore us, and it behooves every Dimekrat to buckle on his armor to wunst. Noo Gersey may be dependid on. The few Ablishnists we hev, hev gone so far into spellin-books and grammars, that their talk is all Greek to our voters, and so they are safe from their contaminatin appeals. She expex every Stait to do its dooty. She is lonesome and wants company. She stretches out her hands appealinly to her sisters, and sez in winnin tones, “Jine me!” Will yoo not do it? Shel she appeal in vane? Forbid it, Hevin! Rally! Rally! Rally! Petroleum V. Nasby, Lait Paster uv the Church uv the Noo Dispensashun.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CXV. AFTER THE OCTOBER ELECTIONS, 1865. Saint's Rest, (wich is in the Stait uv Noo Gersey, } October the 11th, 1865. Ohio, Ablishn! Pennsylvany, Ablishn! Noo Gersey, not eggsackly Ablishn, but approachin thereunto. Sich is the encouragin news I read in the newspapers this mornin! Sich is the result uv labors Hercoolian, in the above-named Staits. What do the people mean? The pure Dimokrasy, probably, will carry Noo York; but of what consolation is that to me? The two parties, the old, anshent Dimokrasy and the Ablishn, run a race into the realms uv Radikalism, and the Dimokrasy beat them over a length. With a platform standin by Johnson, endorsin his anti-slavery noshens, his Suthern oppression noshens, his hangin uv Mrs. Surratt, et settry, and on that platform a soljer who never votid a Dimekratik ticket in his life, who went into the war a Radikle Ablishnist, and who kum out a Radikle Ablishnist, I don't know that I hev much to choose atween em. Last week I wuz invited into a county in Noo York, to address a Dimekratik meetin. I accepted, (ez my expensis were paid, wich is cheeper and better boardin than I get at the groseries to hum,) and akkordinly I went. I commenst deliverin the speech I hed yoosed all over Noo Gersey. I commenst aboosin the nigger, when the cheerman interruptid me. “Well,” sez I, “wat is it?” rather angrily, for I git warmed up and a sweatin, and don't like to be interruptid. “Why,” sed he, “our constooshn allows a nigger who hez ?250 to vote, and most uv em hev that sum, and we make it a pint to sekoor em.” “They 're a d—d site better off than most uv 26 us white Dimekrats in Noo Gersey,” retortid I, a droppin the nigger and goin on agin President Johnson. “Stop,” whispered the cheerman; “our platform endorses President Johnson.” “Thunder!” remarked I, droppin President Johnson, and slidin easily into a wiggerus denunsiation uv the war. “Good God!” sez the cheerman, “stop! Our platform endorses the war.” I sed nuthin this time, but commenst denouncin the debt. “Hold!” sed the cheerman; “easy—easy—our platform backs up the debt.” “Well, then,” sed I, in a rage, “why in blazes did n't yoo send me a copy uv yoor platform when yoo wantid me to address yoo? Go to thunder and make yoor own speeches;” and I stawked off the platform. Time wuz when wun speech wood do a man all over the North. Now yoo hev to hev a diffrent wun for every Stait, wich makes it impossible for me to travel, for wun effort per season is enuff for me. But, ez I wuz a sayin, we are beat agin, and beat badly—beat on issues uv our own makin— beat with taxes, bonds, war debt, and nigger equality all in our favor. Do n't say to me that we redoost their majorities. What diffrence does it make to a defeatid candidate, whether the majority agin him is one thousand or one hundred? A needle will kill a man ez effectooally ez a broad-sword, ef it 's stuck in the right place. So a majority uv wun is enuff. I hev known men to hold orfises four years, and hev good appetites, on a majority uv one. It 's the orfises we wuz a goin for—it 's them our patriots wanted, and it 's no consolation to them to say they mist by a small majority! It 's holler mockery—the same ez tho you 'd show a starvin man a loaf uv bread jest inside uv iron bars—his fingers are not a inch from it, but, so far ez his cravin stumick is concerned, it mite ez well be across the boundless ocean. We may recover from this backset, but I hev my fears. The people is ez stoopid ez ever, and our leaders is ez akoot ez ever; but, alas! the fact that we hev failed in every thing we hev undertook, for four years, is gettin thro the hair uv thousands, and they look askant at us. Be it ez it may, it makes but little diffrence to me. A few years, and I shel go hentz. Ef the Bible is troo, I shel go where I will find a heavy Dimekratik majority, shoor; ef it is not, and there is no hereafter, why, then, at last, I shel be on a level with the best. “So, let the wide world wag ez it will,” I 'll keep on the even tenor uv my way, takin my nips ez often ez I kin find a confidin sole who hez more money than diskreshun.

      <field name="fulltext">CXVI. THE BOW-LEGGED KNITE; OR, THE RED-HEADED APOTHECARY'S DOOM. A THRILLIN TALE. Chapter I. 'T was nite, in Posey County, Ingeany! [For a full description uv sed nite, see Chapter I uv the author's last and greatest work, “The Rival Blood-tubs; or, The Struggle for Crout.”] The lovely Marguerite de Smythe wuz alone in her chamber. Her hed wuz bowed on a table, on2 wich flickered the dim lite uv a cotton rag floatin in a sarser uv lard. Her disheveled hair, her elasticless stockins, and, more than all else, the hole in the heel uv wun uv em, showed that she wuz laborin under some feerful emotion. For awhile she sot, her fair buzzum heevin like old Ocean when Boreas smites it, her whole frame quiverin like a peach-tree with a dozen little niggers in it. At larst her overcharged feelins found vent in tears. “Marion!” she cried, “thy mop, girl!” and for 12 hours the faithful handmaiden mopped up the pearly tears ez they fell from those beauteous orbs, wringin the rags out of the winder. “This suspense is intolerable,” muttered the frenzied Marguerite. “I kin endoor it no longer. Timothy! Timothy!” she shreeked, in a agony uv despair. Skasely hed the word left her lips ere a step wuz heerd upon the stairs. It approached nearer and nearer—“Thank Heven, 't is him!” screamed the delited girl, ez she threw a buffalo-robe upon the floor to faint on in case Timothy shood fale to ketch her in his arms. Nearer and nearer the step approached; a heavy hand wuz laid upon the latch, the door flew open, and Marguerite rushed into the arms uv—not Timothy—but the Bow-legged Knite! A demoniakle smile played over his sinister countenance ez, wringin the neck uv Marion and pitchin her out uv the winder, he restored the inannymate Marguerite 2 conshusnis, by sousin a barl or 2 uv water upon her. Chapter II. Marguerite wuz kum 2, and boldly confronted the hated monster who stood afore her. “Villin! wretch! sanguinary skunk!” she exclaimed, her nose turnin up in skorn until it reached the top uv her head, and caught on a hair-pin; “what wouldst thou with me?” “Thy hand!” “O, Heven! that I, the last uv a long and noble line, shood live to hear this!” exclaimed the maiden, drawin herself up to her full hite, by means uv a pulley in the ceelin. “Last uv a long and noble line! By my halidome, thou speekest trooly—thou art the last uv a long and noble line—a clothes-line! Thy father hung himself with the one thy mother used in her biznis. But enuff uv this. Mine thou must be. Thou knowst me well. Cross my purposes, and I am ez frackshus ez a two-year old colt with a chestnut burr under his tail; humor me, and I am ez amiable ez a chicken with dough afore it. Ez for Timothy, yoo shel never wed him—his doom is seeled! Let me but see him cast a look on thee, and I 'll punch the low-born varlet in the stumick—thus.” And the Bow-legged Knite, drawin his shinin blade, made 2 or 3 hundred passes at the wall, endin by turnin a double-somerset. Skasely wuz he dun, when the door flew open and Timothy appeared. Marguerite shreeked, while the Knite threw himself between the doomed apothecary and the door, and drawd his sword. “Ha! ha! ho! ho! I hev thee now, thou pillmixer! thou peddler uv Injin remedies! Prepare for instant death!” exclaimed the Knite, makin a tremenjus blow. But the wary apothecary wuz on his gard, and ez the blow descended, he stept aside. Another blow, dodge; blow, dodge; blow, dodge. Finally, the luckless apothecary, bearin the lifeless form uv Marguerite, wuz in a corner. Retreat wuz out uv the question, and further dodgin impossible. A happy thot struck him. Ez the sword uv the Knite desended, he dexterously interposed the body uv Marguerite, ducked his head, darted between the legs uv the Knite, and run like a dog with a tin kittle tied to his tail. The Knite, robbed uv his vengeance, and seein his beloved Marguerite dead at his feet, stabbed hisself and died also. Chapter III. 2 months elapst. Timothy ventured back, and a horrible site met his vision. The lovely Marguerite wuz cut in 2, and the Knite, stun-dead, wuz lyin beside her. But he wuz not to be discouraged by small difficulties. Drawin the two pieces uv the beloved Marguerite together, he applied Radway's Ready Relief. “Thank Heven!” he exclaimed, ez the flesh united. A dose of the Renovatin Resolvent, follered immediately by Repeatin Regulators, restored her to life, consciousnis, appetite, and Timothy. They were married the next day. Timothy wuz not vindictive. Upon the Knite's promisin never to molest him agin, he brought him to life, and paid his fare to Shecago, where he is now runnin a hack, and doin well.

      <field name="fulltext">CXVII. GIVES HIS EXPERIENCE IN THE MATTER OF NEGRO IMPUDENCE. Saint's Rest, (wich is in the Stait uv Noo Gersey,) } October the 1st, 1865. It is a cardinal principle in the Dimekratik creed, that a nigger, taken from his normal state uv subjekshun and placed on a level with men, will bekum overbearin to a degree most irritatin to the well-regulated Caucashen mind. I kin testify on this pint from persnal experience. Ten or fifteen years ago, when I wuz younger than I am now, and the blood coursed toomulchuser thro my vanes than it does now, in the winter uv life, (years gathers wisdom uv mind at the expense uv strength uv body,) I wuz, wun summer—a very hot summer—wun day a layin on my back, resolved in2 a committee uv ways and means on the question uv suthin to eat. Hunger overkum my nateral proclivities, and I wuz forst to go to the nearest grocery and saw sum wood for a froogal meal uv crackers and cheese and new rum. While sweatin at this unwonted exertion, and cussin Eve with all my powers uv cussin, for eatin the froot that sprouted into sich bitter froot ez I wuz then tastin, I resolved that ez woman brought toil onto me, woman should release me from it. Droppin the saw, I to wunst went and washed my face and offered myself in marriage to five widders, each uv whom I knowd owned a good farm. By each uv the five I wuz promptly rejectid, amid peals uv lafture. Nary once discouraged, I offered myself to 5 maidens whose fathers hed good farms, and wuz five times rejected, in three cases bein ignominiously kicked out uv the house. Then I bethawt myself uv one more chance. In the outskirts uv the town wuz a nigger wench, who earned a very comfortable livin a washin. Believin that the honor uv hevin a white husband wood more than compensate her for the extra labor uv supportin me, and bein sure that she wood suffishently appreciate my condesenshun in marryin her, I made her the tender uv my hart and hand. She accepted, and we wuz married. For a time all wuz peace. She insisted on my accompanyin her to church, wich I did, among the jeers uv the populace. “Rail on!” thot I, “rail on! I kin stand yoor railin better than the sweat nessary to answer the demands uv a cravin stumick.” Finally a crisis cum. The flour wuz out—the pork-barl wuz empty—the taters wuz gone, and the wood-pile waxed low, and Mrs. Nasby sejested that I shood supply the achin void that wuz evident in our house-keepin arrangements. I replied that I sposed sich wuz the case, and that she must go and buy, that we mite eat. “Wha 's de money?” replied she. “My deer,” retortid I, “yoo hev struck the entire root uv the trubble in a breath. I hev no objeckshun to the mere labor uv buyin the provisions—nay, I wood even go so far as to tote em home—hed I the money with wich to do it. That money is for yoo to earn, to prokoor. Permit me to sejest that yoo to wunst make yoorself the agreeable foreground to a wash-tub that yoo wunst wuz, and on the proceeds uv sed tablow we 'll eat and be merry.” “Wa-a-t!” sed she, growin white in the face; “d' ye tink I 'se a-gwine to work to s'port myseff, now I 'se married?” “Trooly, I do,” sed I, calmly. “And yoo, too?” “Indubitably,” sed I, smilin at the absurdity uv her questions. She growd black in the face agin—a angry gleam shot from her eyes, and her kinky hair bekum straight. Suddenly I lost all consciousness. I felt a sensation uv moving rapidly thro space. For a minnit I fancied a tightnin sensation at my throat and at the seat uv my pants, and all wuz darkness. At last I awoke, and found that she hed throwd me jest thirty feet out uv the door into the front yard. I assoomed, then, all the authority uv a husband. I demanded admittance, when from a upper window appeared my angelic spouse, who emptied on my head a bucket uv skaldin water, informin me that I might expect such treatment ez often ez I presented myself. I left that town that nite, with my mind thoroughly made up ez to the complete cussednis uv the Ethiopian charikter. No sooner hed I elevated that ongrateful woman to my level and made her my ekal, than she expectid me to support her, the same ez ef she hed bin uv my blood. I left her in disgust, and to-day, I doubt not, she and a child, half uv the cuss-tainted blood uv Ham and half uv the proud Caucashen race, mourn and weep my prolonged stay. Will I ever go back? Not any. I made one effort to elevate the race, and one is enuff. Cood I sell her and the child, I wood; but ez that is illegal in this Stait, she may tred her weary path alone. Petroleum V.

      <field name="fulltext">CXVIII. A FEW LAST WORDS. Saint's Rest, (wich is in the Stait uv Noo Gersey,) } October the 15th, 1865. Dimekrats uv the Yoonited States! My task is finisht. I hev throwd together the views, opinyuns, and prophecies contained in the 4going pages, ez so many finger-posts to guide yoo along the road to success; ez so many bekon-lites to warn yoo agin the quicksands and quagmires that dot sed road here and there, and into wich so many uv our most promisin travelers hev bin engulfed. Alars! how many who set out when I did, and stepped ez high ez a ?1400 hoss, with plated harness on, hev fallen into em. Free-soilism wuz the fust wun, and into that Van Booren and Chase drowndid theirselves. Popler sovereignty wuz another, and into that Duglis swamped. War, bloody war agin our Suthern brethrin, wuz another, and into that nearly the entire party who wuz wat the world calls decent enuff to soot the aristocratic Ablishnist, plunged headlong, leavin travelin in gloomy silence only a few, who, like myself, can't change their habits enuff to git into any other organization. It is well for us that we can't. We shoodent be comfortable anywhere else. Nacher never wastes nothin—she gives us all we kin enjoy. The bird that soars into the bloo empyrium wuz made to soar into the bloo empyrium, and consekently wuz provided with holler bones, and wings. Spozn the elefant shood hev a cravin to soar into the bloo empyrium, (I like that word—its hefty,) woodent it be continyooally mizable becoz it coodent sore into the bloo empyrium? Likewise. Nacher alluz makes a stingy man lean and thin. Why? Becoz. Spozn nacher shood give a mean man the entrales and stumick uv a liberal man and a good liver. Don't you see that his hevin the sed entrales and stumick, and the desires appertainin, and the meanness that prevented his fillin em, wood make him mizable? So, ez nacher did n't give him the disposition to fill stumick and entrales, she did n't also give him the stumick and entrales to fill. All uv wich goes to show that we hev jest ez much sense and decency ez we are capable uv enjoyin. I am a old man, whose sands uv life hev neerly run out, and, therefore, my words are entitled to weight. In these pages I hev laid down rools that must be follered religiously, ef we ever expect to succeed. To recapitulate: 1. Skools are agin us. Compare stanch Virginia, with nary a skool-house, and Ablishn Massychusitts, dotted with em. When a man learns to read he alluz gits conseetid, and goes to thinkin for hisself. 2. Churches are, ez a rool. I bleeve in religion when properly preached, but a preacher shood only read sich passages ez Onesimus and Hayger. But even then they are hardly safe. The members attendin are apt to go to other churches, jest to see the difference—then a revival snaps them up, and wunst regelarly convertid, they go over to the enemy without fail. 3. Whisky is alluz a safe tool in our hands. When a man gits so ez to barter his vote for free drinks, he is too low for tother party to reach down to—he kin only find one bidder, and he 's ours at our own price. 4. Never allow a man to skratch a tickit. It 's a exercise uv his own will, wich can't be allowed. The convenshuns decide not only what we are to bleeve, but who we shel vote for. These rools is general. There are others, but I will not go into partickelers. Wun duty devolves upon us, wich we must not forget. Slavery, that divine system, by and thro wich we, ez a party, wuz perpetooated for years, must be agin revived. We can't git along without it. We must hev suthin on wich the South will be a unit—sum intrest so all-powerful ez to swaller up all causes uv diffrence down there, smooth down all miner pints, and forse em to be troo to Dimokrasy. Then, for them to control, they must hev us, for they don't compose half uv this Union, except in the article uv impudence, uv wich they hev at least three-fourths. Us they must hev to carry enuff Congressional deestricks to give em a majority; enuff Staits North to elect the President uv their choice, that thro them they may control things ez they want to. Uv coarse, they will hold all the heavy orfises on the skore uv pekooliar fitnis, the South alluz hevin bin the nursery uv statesmen; but, thank Heven, the post-orfises and collectorships, and sich, they don't want, and them we will hev. A standin hatred uv Noo England must be stidily inkulkated; not only stidily, but viggerusly and enthoosiastikly. Them Staits are a growin rich off uv us, jest the same ez in a strikly Dimekratik community one smart doggry-keeper absorbs all the capital. Therefore, we must hate her, and that hate is a lever uv power for us. Let us all jine in hatin Noo England. I hev no apologies to offer for any sentimence contained in these pages. I may not hev sed enuff agin the nigger—I may not hev suffishently aboozed Noo England—I may hev bin too easy on Linkin, and I may hev sed too much for Micklellan. But, ef this be so, these errors must be inskribed to my head, and not to my heart. That I am sound to the core in my Dimokrasy, let my noze, and the fact that I never skratched a tikit, attest. In concloosion. To the leaders I recommend akootnis, energy, and perseverance. To the voters, steddinis, submission, and unquestionin fidelity. To orfis-holders in our Staits, liberality, and ez much honesty ez is consistent with their own interests and the interests uv the party. To our friends, my love! To our enemies, my burnin cuss! Adoo! Farewell! Petroleum V. Nasby, Lait Paster uv the Church uv the Noo Dispensashun. THE END.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">A NEW AND COMPLETE BOOK-BUYER'S MANUAL. CARROLL'S NEW PRACTICAL CATALOGUE OF CURRENT MISCELLANEOUS BOOKS PUBLISHED IN THE UNITED STATES. 1 Vol. 267 pages. Stiff Paper Cover. Price 50 Cts. SENT BY MAIL, POST-PAID. The need of a Catalogue of the current Book Publications of the United States, simple in plan and comprehensive in matter, has been much felt by booksellers and book-buyers. From causes apparent to all, Foreign Books have become so expensive here that but few, comparatively, are bought, American Houses republishing at cheaper rates such as the popular taste demands. A complete Catalogue of American Publications would make an expensive and unwieldy book, not adapted to the wants of the majority of readers. The publishers of this work have, therefore, adopted a plan of a Catalogue of such Miscellaneous Books published in the United States as are most likely to be called for by the public, confining it to reasonable limits, arranging the works alphabetically (according to the names of the authors,) and giving the prices fixed by the respective Publishers, with a view to making it practically useful as a medium between booksellers and booksellers and book-buyers.
