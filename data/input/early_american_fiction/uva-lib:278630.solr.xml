      <field name="fulltext">JOHN OMAR TO EDWARD MOLTON Philadelphia, — My Dear Molton, I have just arrived. My spirits are depressed; the weather is gloomy, and I feel myself to be really and truly alone, in a land of strangers. How will this adventure end?—Would that I might rend away the dark curtain, for a moment, and look into futurity. I might appalled--I might; but, were it not better to have your senses reel at once, and all your strength desert you; than to be cheated, as I have been, year after year, with hope and disappointment? What can I say to you? It is impossible that I can have anything to write; yet, my heart is heavy with thought and speculation. I promised to write, and, therefore have I written. Let me hear from you directly. I shall be impatient for your answer; for I feel as a stranger here, even in my retirement. There is one thing that troubles me. But you will suffer no trifling there, will you?—Is Grenville serious?— I know not what to think, but I wish you to inform me of all that concerns him and Juliet. I saw him after I left you, for about ten minutes. His manner was solemn; and mine, I fear, rather arrogant; still, there was something mysterious, I thought, in his deportment, which justified me, in a measure. I came by your lodgings, on purpose to communicate what I had learnt, to you; but, you had gone out, and I could not wait. The stage-coach was just rattling round the corner. No—Molton. This is a desperate enterprise. There is no hope—no chance; but, as I have set out upon it, under your counsel and impulse, I never will abandon it, never!—until my fate be determined. Yet remember— to-morrow night is the trial—and I do not expect to succeed. I have not even hope to sustain me. Yours, forever, OMAR. P. S.—I open this in dismay and trepidation—what have I seen?—I was hurrying, to the Post Office—and I could swear that I met the apparition of Juliet,—palled ---her veil over her face—hanging upon the arm of Grenville. I was thunderstruck. I could not believe my senses. Explain it to me, Molton?—What can this mean? Have I really seen her?—Or have my senses yielded to the incessant fatigue and agitation, that I have experienced? I know not—I see as usual—hear as usual—my memory, too, is as distinct; and I can discover no signs of excitement about me, except a fierce throbbing of the temples. I almost touched her, before I saw her—and then—there was something in her action, that made me look up. It was that of one, trying to conceal herself;--- she gathered her veil thickly about her face,---and I thought---perhaps it was fancy----that she had been weeping. The whole passed off in a moment,---like a flash of light----but if it was not Juliet Gracie, by heaven, it was her apparition. She entered a carriage that stood waiting for her;---and then only, did I turn my eyes to the man that was with her. His back was toward me; but it struck me that he appeared very like Mr. Grenville. Is'nt it strange?---But I suppose that resemblance obtruded itself upon me, in consequence of my thinking of Juliet. Yet I cannot laugh at it. I would---I try to---but I cannot. There is a strange reality, notwithstanding the suddenness and rapidity, with which it appeared, that I am trembling at, yet. The result is---that I have run into a bookstore close by the office, torn open my letter, and written just as I felt. vol. ii. A 2 My conclusion is this---either my senses are disturbed--- or, I have seen a most unaccountable resemblance--- or—Gracious God!---I will not imagine such a thing. It were a sure proof of my disordered brain. No---she is not a woman for such adventures. Write immediately, if you any mercy on me. JOHN OMAR.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">EDWARD MOLTON TO JOHN OMAR Baltimore, —. It was no apparition, my dear Omar. The woman, that you saw, was really Juliet; not Juliet R. Gracie, to be sure—but Juliet R. Grenville. She is now the wife of Grenville. May she be happy!—O, my friend, never did a prayer ascend from my heart with such fervour and sincerity as that—May she be happy! In tears, you say. I hope not. Much may be allowed for her timidity, and the suddenness of the affair; but she is a woman of too high a soul, to permit the simple terrours of the girl, to continue so long. She is now a bride —a wife; and there must be no common sorrow at her heart, if it be visibly heavy at such a moment. I know little of her husband—very little. My inquiries have been satisfactory to a certain extent; that is, I have heard no serious matter against him; but then I have arrived at little to convince me that he is the man, against whose heart, that woman ought to lean, forever and ever. He should have a great soul; a mind of unadulterate grandeur, to be the pillow of such a spirit. You speak of an interview with him—and of some mystery. I do not like that word—it is a bad symptom. Where there is mystery, there is always guilt or shame. Let me hear the particulars. Tell me what you said to him, and how he behaved. I am somewhat impatient; for, the marriage was very sudden; and a friend of the family informs me, that it was more like a funeral than a wedding. I do not profess to understand it; I had no idea that matters had gone so far:—if I had, perhaps I might have interposed; and yet, that would have been childish; for Juliet is old enough, and wise enough, to choose for herself. Still—after all, there is a tormenting anxiety upon my spirits. I want to know why they married, so hastily—nay—why they married at all. To me, it is a deep mystery. Let them beware, who have spread the toils for her—if there be aught in the affair, that they would not avow in the face of heaven. She is a creature that has been dear to me—and I would not undertake the retribution slowly, or reluctantly, if she have been wronged,—wronged, I care not how. You speak of the depression of your spirits. All that is natural. You are about entering the world for yourself. You are cut adrift; and, in the hurry of your first feeling, you know not whether you be afloat or foundering. Mark me. Your confidence will soon return. I have felt the same timidity, the same darkness, the same irresolution. Yet, it wore off. My dependence was cut off. I was alone. No matter how weak the prop, upon which we have leaned—withdraw it suddenly, and we are apt to fall;—no matter how frail may have been the tenure, by which we were upheld, though it were the untwisted flax in the blaze—or the tangled gossamer—if abruptly parted, we are in peril. Let a man, while he is standing upon a precipice, and holding upon a single thread, or a cobweb, find it yielding; and, it is ten to one, that he falls;—but snap it, and he will fall! Such is human nature. Half of our stay and support is imaginary. I remember my own feeling, when I was first let adrift, dependent alone upon myself. For a time, I was like one, shipwrecked on a barren rock, sick and alone, faint and desolate. But, after a little time, my spirit began to get up and look about her. I learned to depend upon myself. I grew surprised at my own strength.— Every movement encreased my admiration and confidence. I looked at my arms; they were strong;—at my frame—it was of iron. I measured my faculties—my acquisitions. Was I not in health?—unburthened and alone? Great God!—young, and in health! with nobody to care for, but myself—it was impious to doubt! What!— were the fools and blockheads about me; the weak and the wicked; the sickly and feeble of spirit, were they to succeed; and I to lay me down and die, in the first ditch! —No—. Omar, I pray you to reflect. I pray you to recal my parting admonition. It is irreligious to doubt. God never meant that such men should doubt. No—like Bonaparte, he that is full of blood and pulse, when he surveys his object, should “precipitate himself upon it,”— at once, like a tyger upon his prey. Omar, remember my prediction. You will succeed. Depend upon it; you will succeed. But then—then it is, that I shall tremble for you. At first, you will astonish. Why? Because you are a stranger, and nothing is expected from you.— But you have many competitors; persevering some; unprincipled and adroit men, some, who have taken the field before you. Yet the campaign is not over. March on—adopt the plan of Moreau. Do not stop to reduce every post as you advance. Do not fear to leave an enemy in your rear---that is the precaution of a coward. That fashion has gone by. You must not provide for a retreat. There is no retreat for you. “Set fire to your shipping.” You must conquer, or perish. If you prevail— if! —why do I use the word?—you shall prevail —your enemies will join you, of course. If you fail-,it matters not that a few fortified posts are in your rear. They can, at best, only accelerate your destruction.— They cannot make it more sure. Remember your reward---what were you doing here?—Nothing. Every hour, you became weaker and more wavering. You did right in going. Any enterprize were better than idleness. It will raise you in the estimation of her, that is dear to you. Had you rested here a little longer, you would have been overlooked; nay, you would have deserved it? Shall you succeed? Yes—but do not be impatient of your reward. Remember that there is a long life of discipline, toil, experience, and trial, for you. What would you do with a wife now? Are you not more helpless than a woman? Where is your profession? Your security? I speak not of your talents;—for I cannot speak of them, without appearing to flatter you. But, with all the talent in the world, there must be an established business habit, before you ought to think, for a moment, of hazarding the happiness of that woman. No—your sentiments are right. Your promise was noble—manly. You ought never to return here, but with reputation and money.— Then you will come clothed with beauty and strength. Then, I will embrace you, with all my heart and soul— Let me never see you here, on any other condition. But---as I have before said, I do not tremble for you, now. Your time of peril is to come;---your season of trial, and doubt and dismay. At first you will astonish; you will carry all before you. But the enthusiasm of the hour will die away. Reaction will follow. You will be dealt with unkindly and coldly. Your real merit, for a time, will be overrated. Too much will be expected of you; too much said. In the nature of things, you never can astonish the world a second time. You will be less warmly cheered:—more coldly criticised—and your heart will reel in its perplexity and darkness. Then, will be your time of peril. For that period, I tremble. To it, I look with alarm and apprehension. I know your temper. I know to what aliment it is accustomed. To one so enthusiastick, the dry business manner of the Philadelphians, would be cold and uncomfortable nourishment But prepare yourself. Expect to fail. You do expect it—you will arise—Nay, while I am writing this, you have arisen; and, feeling that you had every thing to gain, and nothing to lose, you have acquitted yourself like a man. Do you remember the despondency of Wolfe? He wrote to Chatham, that he was sure of nothing but failure, and death. Therefore did he succeed; and, therefore, will you succeed. When a man has brought his mind, steadily, to the contemplation of disaster, humiliation and death, what else can disturb him—Farewell, dear Omar.—Let me know, immediately, he result.—Yours, EDWARD MOLTON.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">FRANK TO JOHN. New-York, ——. I have just time to inform you, my dear brother, that the affairs of Ramsay, Dalton &amp; Co. are not quite so desperate as they were supposed. I am ready to leave town, however, for a distant place, where, I hope, by strenuous exertions, to arrest a conspiracy, that I think ruinous to the estate. The gig is at the door;—and, if you do not hear from me soon, I beg that you will attend to the matters here, in person. I may be, possibly, on my way to Jamaica, but shall leave a power of attorney for you. Sarah, I suppose, will write to you. At present, I think that I may say—that there will be something tolerable left for her, even though all the doubtful debts be reckoned desperate. But if the Jamaica house stand well, poor Sarah will be an heiress yet.—There is a report here, that Juliet and Grenville have run off. It is a ridiculous story, I confess; but how should it be invented, here? Who knows them? I heard it from a perfect stranger. Can she have been imprudent enough to travel with him? Tell me all that you know of the matter, dear John, by return mail, directed to me at Boston, where I shall stop for two or three days, at the most. Good bye, FRANK.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">JOHN OMAR TO EDWARD MOLTON. I have succeeded!—thank heaven, I have succeeded.— I can hardly keep off my knees—my heart is in my mouth. The particulars, I must communicate at some future time, when I can—at present,—I cannot. Farewell, JOHN OMAR.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">JOHN OMAR TO EDWARD MOLTON. I wrote you a single line yesterday, to inform you of my success. Nothing ever astonished me so much.— Whence was that preternatural confidence? was it desperation? It was. I am interrupted. You astonish me—but I have not another word to say, now that she is really married. What a singular adventure! I must communicate it to you. You know that I once paid some attention to anatomy; and there is no science, which may not be made subordinate to this, in which I am now engaged. I have found it so, already; and, willing to refresh my memory, a little, I put myself in the way of the following mysterious affair. At the house where I am boarding, is an eminent surgeon, with whom I lately had a consultation, respecting an extraordinary rupture of the vessels, about the brain, from a slight blow. What I said, seemed to have made some impression upon him; for, he repeatedly renewed the subject; and, yesterday morning, invited me to accompany him on an expedition, which, were you less of a philosopher than you are, I should be unwilling to communicate to you. The mind shrinks with loathing and abhorrence, from the rifler of the grave; no matter, under what pretence; and, he who has ever been in a dissecting room, and witnessed the brutal ribaldry; the incredible indifference, with which the bodies of men, women and children, the beautiful and the strong, are cut up and disfigured, will never think of it afterward, but with a palsy of the heart. Yet— such things are necessary; and, perhaps, an affected levity may sometimes prove the best antidote to squeamishness, or reluctance, in the youthful. Ridicule, we know, will overcome the shamefacedness of most people; and why should it not, the heart-sickness? Sentiment, or delicacy, I confess, are out of the question. The hand of the operator should not relent, while he is severing the most delicate entanglements of the heart; no—to do his duty, he must rend and tear the loveliness before him, like a beast of prey. But, whither am I wandering?— The interest of science, however, will not satisfy a brother, a father, or a husband;—it is no consideration to them, after one, that they have loved and worshipped, has been exposed to the offensive levity of boys; that, after death—the body of woman, is like any other earth—a moulding of clay, only, from which, to be sure, the black blood flows, when the knife hath penetrated it deeply. Well, this gentleman is a stranger here, an adventurer, like myself; and, from what I can learn, a very extraordinary man—one of “God Almighty's scholars,” as Ferguson, the astronomer, called himself; a being, self-taught, self sustained. Heaven protect and prosper such men! I say. It is on them, that we are to depend. Their riches and power are inward, and inexhaustible, and indestructable, except by that hand which gave them tincture, impulse, and spirit. On such men, the common calamities of life have no influence. Poverty, shame, and dishonour; reproach and humiliation, are but so many medicines, to quicken and invigorate their faculties.— But, to the story—or, I shall ramble forever. The professor invited me to the Potter's field, or publick burial ground of this city. The faculty go here, as to a market; and the sexton's shambles are openly accessible, at all times. The day was cold; and we rode on horseback, that we might return, as speedily as possible. While we were in the sexton's hovel, a handsome gig rattled up to the door, containing a lady and a gentleman. Both were elegantly dressed, and of a genteel appearance. The sexton appeared surprised; and we caught the sentiment from his face. The man alighted, and handed out the lady, with extreme caution. He then produced a small square box, and paid the fee for its interment. Said the sexton—“Do you wish to see it buried, sir?—” The reply was “Yes!—I will accompany you, myself.” “Will you not come to the fire?” said the sexton, to the lady.—She bowed, and a few words fell faintly from her lips; and she drew her black veil over her face; and came and sat down by the fire. The seat was near the window, through which she could see the interment. She sobbed deeply, but strove hard to conceal it. Judge of my sensation; to see a mother attend, in such a manner, the funeral of her babe, the day after its birth; conveying it, secretly, to the charnel of a great city; sitting on a bench, made of coffin boards; (fact!) and warming herself, by other shattered remnants of the same kind, blazing in the fire place. I shuddered, for myself, for human nature, for woman kind—when thus convinced how far the brightest and the fairest may be sullied and defaced, by familiarity with man. Worse than all, were my sensations afterward. The professor bought the box, within ten minutes of its interment, and brought it to town. We opened it, and found the body of a lovely babe, which had been violently handled—perhaps murdered; and, in the coffin, was a paper, in which it had been wrapped; on it, was the name of the father, who little thought, I dare say, that he would ever be discovered, on earth. He is a man of property;—a married man—the head of a family. What should I do?—I would have had him arrested, within an hour, could I have established his guilt. No more—at present. By the way, you know something of my antipathy to old maids. Many a time have I wondered at your seriousness in their defence. The thing is no longer a mystery. I have found one here, that used to be an acquaintance of yours? Nay—perhaps it is the very woman,— for I believe that your favourite was a Bostonian—she, of whom you used to speak so reverently. Is it true? Is she that noble creature, full of dignity and sweetness, who, when her heart was young, saw its lord perish; and deliberately, voluntarily, and without any clamorous sorrow, devoted herself to his memory---loved his spirit---resisted all the fascination of life, without becoming morose, or melancholy, to the view of the world;--- widowed herself, and loved on,—like one that cannot love but once? Is this the woman? She appears very amiable and intelligent; so unaffected too, that she speaks with the most natural and pleasant air in the world, of leading apes hereafter, in preference to being led by them, here.— The story of her life is like that of her, on whom I have heard you dwell with such pride and emphasis. She lost vol. ii. B her beloved one in his youth. She was rich, accomplished, and full of talent,—sought after, on all sides;—yet she had the calm, beautiful steadiness of devotion in her love;—its memory was a religion,—its object, a martyr, a disciple—an apostle, whom she could not abandon. She refused many an offer;—and is now alone, cheerful, and beloved; courted on all sides. How different from that strange masculine woman, whom you brought so speedily to her bearing—at madam Hartley's—a woman whom, were it not for your high opinion of her mind, I should most cordially hate. But you know her better than I; and, I am willing to believe, that the darkness and desolation, which are about her—her loneliness—and strength—have made her what she is. O, would that she would keep watch and guard upon her temper. She would be less terrible—and more welcome even to her dearest friends. Yet—let me not speak disrespectfully of her. She is of a family, whose daughters were men —and whose sons were more than men. Can it be wonderful, that she should, now and then, exhibit her strength upon these he-creatures, that thrust themselves in her way? I remember your first meeting with her. I smiled then;—for I saw, by the colour of your eyes, that she had gone, exactly far enough—that there was a settled purpose in your heart. But I smiled more, when I saw her attempt to put you aside, as she did other men. I knew that, if you awoke, she would tremble, in every joint, at your aspect. Yet you forbore. I loved you for your forbearance? But—it did not continue.—I am sure that it did not; else how have acquired you this mastery over her? Your dominion is settled and established. I am glad of it,—because, I perceive that you respect her; and I thank you for teaching me to speak more reverently of her. But how different from this woman! Enough—since I have seen her, I have discharged all the colouring of my heart,—that pity, dislike, and almost hatred, which I felt once, for old maids. I find that a woman may be single —and somewhat old; yet dignified, charming, and intelligent. And now for Grenville. By the way—a letter from Frank—He has heard of Juliet. The story goes, that it is an elopement!—I shall write to him, immediately. Yes—I will, while I remember it, relate my conversation with Mr. Grenville, that evening. I must be very brief though, for I am continually interrupted. I was abrupt and direct, as I usually am, when I am in earnest. I asked him if he was serious in his addresses. I thought that there was a smile coming up in his face,—but he repressed it—and his forehead darkened. “By what authority, young man, do you make the inquiry? Do you consider me accountable to you?” “I do,” said I, without hesitation. He looked surprised; and a silence of half a minute followed, as if he were afraid to trust his voice; at last, he said, more calmly than I could have said it, I am sure—nay, almost as calmly, I do believe, as Edward Molton would have said it. “I am ready to answer your questioning, when I know, precisely, your authority. Are you a relation?” “No.” “Her friend?”— “Yes.” “Her lover perhaps?” “Sir,” said I—“I do not shrink from even that question. I am her lover.” He turned pale—and the fire flew out of his eyes. “Understand me,” said I, “I am her lover, I have been, ever since I knew her;—but I am no favoured lover. But— I have a brother—a stout-hearted brother, who would die for her—the vessels of his brain shall not be ruptured causelessly. Tell me what you mean;—come to the point, at once—I do not wish to hurt your feelings. I would avoid a quarrel;—but my brother is away; and I —I, only, am the guardian of a—a—,” my voice trembled. He seized my hand. “Young man,” said he, “I respect you.” “I will therefore answer you—I will even anticipate your questions. Yes—I am serious. I do love Miss Gracie. I will marry her, if I can. This is all that I can tell you. Whether I have any reason to hope or not, I cannot communicate to you;—farewell ---you have disturbed me—you will know, for a certainty, within a few days, in what relation we stand to each other—.” There, my dear Molton,---that is all that passed at the time that you speak of; but there was an agitation—an embarrassment in his manner that, to me, heaven pardon me for the uncharitable thought---to me, looked suspicious and mysterious. Farewell.---I have not forgotten what you said. I shall persevere;---and, I hope, trim my little bark so gallantly that, whether she sink or swim, whether she scud over, or under the water, the people that see her shall cry, well done!. I shall try to write to you to-morrow;--at present, I am so pestered with attention, that I cannot look about me. So it is—but, as you say—the wind will change, and I must be prepared for it. Yours, ever, JOHN OMAR.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">MOLTON IN REPLY. Be not surprised, my dear Omar, if you do not hear from me for a week to come; nay, even if I meet you, in Philadelphia. I have a scheme in view, that will tear away, or detect the mystery of which we complain. It is even said here, that Juliet ran away. I am astonished at the report; and, though I find that nobody believes it, yet all repeat it. How can they reconcile such things to their consciences?—What! repeat, and give currency to what they do not believe themselves!—nay, to what they know to be a lie. Alas, poor human nature! This reminds me of our dispute—Suppose the story true—for, it is even said that Jane turned Juliet out of doors—or shut them against her, which is the same thing—suppose the story true. Yet some that have told it, believed it to be a lie. Is it not true then, that one may tell the truth, and yet, at the same moment, be guilty of lying? Certainly. The heart may lie. So, one may tell a falsehood—and yet speak the truth. It is enough for him, if he believe what he say. It matters not, whether it be true or not. If he believe it, he speaks truth; if he do not, he lies, whether what he says, be true, or not. That woman, Jane, is at the bottom of this—if she be— Omar—you never heard me threaten—that is not my way—I may bite, but I never bark. But if Jane be the doer of this iniquity, it were better for her that she had never been born. I have her completely in my power;— to a certain extent, she, herself, is sensible of this—but O, she knows not the tremendous truth. You will soon hear from me, or see me. Direct to New York,—for, it is possible that I may pass through Philadelphia, in such a hurry, as not to be able to see you. I have some things to do, yet—but they won't detain me long. About the child. Beware of that secret. It may be a matter of life and death to you. He, who could bury his babe, where he must have known that its little frame would be searched, through every filament, and fibre, vessel and nerve, with the dissecting knife— a married man, too—a father!—he must be a murderer in his heart! Beware of him. The ends of justice may not require you to move; if they do—call on me. I will stand by you, whatever may happen. But remember—if he be in fact, a murderer—he will never rest, till he hath strangled the secret in your heart. It were a less crime to stifle and suffocate you, than his own child. On the contrary—if he be powerful, married, and the head of a family, the portentous secret must be buried. So—unless you go, at once, unto the hall of justice, and impeach the wretch for murder,—you had better be silent. Nay— my advice is, that you be silent. The hand of God will be upon him, night and day;—the beautiful babe—blackned and defaced by his blasphemous hands, will lie forever upon his pillow,—with its little purple lips touching his—and sweet eyes—weltering in their first tears— and the blood settled about its pretty throat. O God, Omar—for ten thousand worlds, would I not see a creature of my loins sitting upon my pillow with that look!— Ten thousand murders,---the sacrifice of many men--- were less terrible, less frightful than that!---The innocent, the helpless,---our own dear hearts in miniature--- our thought, and pulse and passion clothed with flesh.— vol. ii B 2 O, it were putting our hand profanely, upon an image, fresh from the moulding of our God;—Who could lacerate---who could deface it!.--A father!---no---no devil could do that--no leopard, in his wrath, would tear his own young. No---it is impossible. But if he have---why let him live. Let him live!---that were more terrible than many deaths. Let him live, and hear nothing but the continual sob of a strangling infant;---see nothing, but its pretty hands quivering in agony,---its little eyes dim and blood shot—and be eternally haunted with beautiful dead children. Farewell---but, before we part, remember that there is to be no slumber to your eye-lids now. If you faint--- lift your eyes upward---outstretch your hands to the sky. The earth is not your mother; nor will you find your strength renewed by contact with her. Remember---the strong man slept, and had well nigh perished. He, that could pluck down temples upon his own head, had well nigh perished, as a child, in his imbecility. He was shorn of his strength, sleeping. And he, that cables could not have fettered, in the lordliness of his unimpaired strength, was well nigh imprisoned with loose flax. Swift has the same moral. Lilliputians are able to bind a giant with cobwebs. Thus is it with the minute and swarming foes, that inhabit the heart of man. They spin their manacles of something finer than cobweb; but they are doubled, and doubled, till they have assumed the tenacity of established and confirmed habit; and lo! we are their prisoners! Would that you could have heard a sermon that was pronounced before me, not an hour since. It went to my heart. The preacher stood up, as one having authority. His deep voice; the thrilling solemnity, the unaffected and awful steadiness of his eye, while he uttered his denunciations; the impassioned fervour of his look, when, with clasped hands, he called aloud upon his Father in heaven—Omar, you could not have heard it, without coming away a better man. I, even I, upon whom the language of the pulpit, hath fallen for years, like a continuity of unmeaning sound, upon the senses of a sleeping man—even I was aroused and agitated—alarmed!— The sermon seemed as if meant for me. I know not why; but I thought that no one, who had not known me, and my life and history, could have rained such blows upon my heart, as he did. The loathsome and fiery plague spots, upon it, reddened to their centre, as he breathed upon them —but the effect has been healthful, and salutary. A giant, said he, may sleep. A giant may awake---and, beholding destruction uncovered before him, may be more a giant than ever. He who hath faltered, or turned aside from his course, may outstrip his competitors; may run faster and further, than if he had never wandered or loitered. But who shall say, to what unattainable point, his course had been limited, had he always run for his life; battled, night and day, with his passions. It may be, that he will die a better and a greater man, for having sinned early, and desperately. But wo to him, that adventures on such a sea. The shipwreck of mind and body, is in peril;— nay, the shipwreck of the soul, with all its freight of immortality. And, after all, the forgiven and repentant sinner, even in heaven, will lift up his hands and say, that it were something better never to have sinned at all, than to have sinned, and been forgiven.—He was right. Omar, such are the doctrines that man should preach. We are not to wrangle our lives away about mysterious and questionable points. They are not meant for discussion. But there is a religion, a vital and inherent religion, in the heart of man, that will appear, when invoked gently, and in simplicity. Say to the four corners of the earth—Do as ye would be done by—it is the essence of all religion; and the four corners of the earth will ring with hallelujahs. God never meant that aught, which is capable of being misunderstood, should be essential. All that is clearly taught in the scripture, is clearly important. All that is not so, to my view, is just as clearly unimportant. Do you remember Dr. Mason? You have heard him. You know his overbearing, arrogant, Johnsonian way. A mighty man, a Philistine, he may be, in theological warfare—but this, this that I heard from his own lips, wicked as I was, and am, made me look up to the roof, while the words were yet sounding in my ears— almost in the expectation that it would fall in upon us, in thunder, and dust, and smoke. Said he—“there are a kind of people in this world, who have a sort of qualified reliance upon themselves; and others, who have the same qualified dependance upon their Saviour. Both unite in the belief that, hereafter, all their own deficiencies in holiness, may be made up out of the Saviour's stock. Let me make it familiar to you. Such christians are a sort of merchants—“they draw drafts upon God Almighty; and, fearful of their being protested, they get Jesus Christ to endorse them.” Do you not shudder? I do, Omar —I do;—yet I heard Dr. Mason use that very illustration, and almost those very words, in his own pulpit.— Yet, he is a great man; he is of the orthodox. Heaven! what is the true meaning of impiety?---blasphemy?---and what is toleration in the religious?---a mere name, synonimous with weakness.[1] [1] This Dr. M. is the man, who, after denouncing all that should associate with Unitarians, In a late sermon of his, as rather worse than them, who keep company with the damned; threw down the book, left the desk, and went, straightway, to the house of Mr. Taylor, the Unitarian clergyman, of Philadelphia, and took refuge there, for the night.—Ed. The religious, no matter of what belief, Mahometan or Christian, Pagan or Jew, are always tolerant or intolerant, exactly in proportion to their weakness. The feeble are always clamorous for toleration. The strong allege, that toleration and indifference are convertible terms. But enough---that is a theme, upon which I do not often lay my unconsecrated hands---but when I do, I am carried away with it. The truly religious, I venerate. Right or wrong, the honest man is always the religious man, to me;---and, right or wrong, I hold myself bound to respect the scruples of a tender conscience. Do you remember R—'s definition of orthodoxy and heresy? “Orthodoxy is my opinion---heterodoxy yours.” How simple, yet how bitter, is the truth! It reminds you of the lunatick that we saw. “What!---are you confined here?---and for what?” said you. “Because I am mad,” said he. “Mad!---you!” “O yes,” he replied---“it was a question for the majority. I maintained that all the world were mad; and all the world maintained that I was mad. They were the majority, and they put me in here. Had I the power, I should have done the same with them.” Yes---the lady, of whom you write, is she, of whom I have so frequently spoken to you. Cultivate her acquaintance. She is an honour to her sex. Nay, Omar, let me urge it upon you. You are young. Accustom yourself to the society of virtuous women;---the first symptom of degeneracy, in man, is a dislike to the company of such women. Give to them their true weight in society. Let nothing induce you to detract from it. Support them with all your power; have compassion on their infirmities; and remember that, in proportion as you diminish the influence of woman in society, you diminish the influence of virtue—nay, of all that is beautiful or endearing in life. I have thought of a scheme for you. Have you much iron in your character?---and constitution? Can you toil, year after year, for a distant, and not absolutely certain object? You are young---ardent---“not averse to strife.” What say you? All South America---all India, is open to you. Were I a few years younger---or were it not, even as it is, for one thing, which hinders me from undertaking any enterprise, which may not speedily be accomplished, I care not at what peril---I would embark this hour for India. I have thought a great deal of the matter---a great deal. I know the jealousy of the British powers; but I know also the hatred and dissension that are among them---the resources and population of the country---every province of which is an empire;---and I would undertake, with the labour of a few years, to overturn the British empire there. You smile---come to me, and you will smile no longer. You will no longer regard the thing as ridiculous. Come to me, and I will put charts, tables, manuscripts into your hand, that will convince you. Omar---nothing is impossible to a man of resolution and perseverance. The scheme may now sound like the speculation of a madman. Yet, I am not mad. I reason as coldly and as closely as ever. Give me a problem to solve, and I will go about it as steadily.— What then?—this. I have learnt to have confidence in myself. I can look back five, six, seven, and eight years of my life; and I find myself now, where, if I had then been heard to say that I should be, at this time, I should have been thought a madman. Omar, it would be a less rise for me, for the next ten years, to be the king of some Indian province, than it has been, for the last six years, to cease to be what I was, and to become what I am. Adieu. EDWARD MOLTON.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">JOHN TO SARAH. Why do I not hear from you, dear Sarah? How do you employ yourself? Have you heard of Juliet's marriage? What do you think of it? Molton is on the track of something. I know not what; but his look is that of a bloodhound. Frank told me to write to you; but I know not what to write; my heart is sore and full, and all my veins feel distended. I have had certain severe trials, of late; and have just begun my professional career. Has Frank written you that the affairs of your father look more promising of late? He says so; and he is rather cautious in such matters. He is gone to Jamaica. Let me hear from you, immediately. Do you want any money? Say so, without any scruple, if you do. It shall be remitted, at once. Have you heard from Juliet, since her marriage? If you have, and she has told you all about it, I entreat you to let me know the particulars, without a moment's delay. You are, probably, astonished at the composure, with which I speak of Molton, after all that has passed; and Frank, I know, is. He reproached me, bitterly, in a short note; and almost called me an accomplice in William's murder. But why should I be wrathful with him? We want mercy, and shall we not show it? Beside, on what ground am I to complain? His own confession, it may be said. But, by his own confession, he is not guilty of murder. What did he? O, heaven, Sarah—it is hard to believe it; but such is man!—he did no more than I, or any other man would have done, in the same situation. So, I have forgiven him. Nay, more—I love him more than ever. I feel a companionship with his infirmities. I pity him. He is lowered, to be sure, in my veneration; but he has come infinitely nearer to my heart. There is humanity in him, now; for he is weak and passionate. Before, he was something preternatural—calm —immoveable—indestructible. Farewell. JOHN OMAR. P. S.—A long letter from you!—the servant has just handed it to me. I have no time to answer it, having to run away this moment; and, as I may be prevented to-night, I shall send this, just as it is, by to-day's mail; and make a formal answer, as I can, hereafter. Molton, I suspect, means to have an interview, which will try some of our acquaintances, rather severely.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">EDWARD MOLTON TO —. Upon my word, you will never be satisfied, I am afraid, till I have convinced you that you are a blockhead!—in matters of poetry, I mean; for, as a man of good understanding, and fine taste, not natural, but acquired taste, in other matters, I shall always regard you. But why put me to the trouble of telling you such a disagreeable truth? Will nothing content you—and Mr. Walsh, and the present conductors of your North American, but to be told, in downright English, when poetry is the subject of your conversation, that you don't, any of you, know what you are talking about. Why not keep to what you understand? Why not be content with the reputation of good sense, and excellent judgment? Why drive a man to an absolute demonstration of your insensibility, in all matters of feeling and passion? You can't agree with me, in my estimate of Mr. Percival, or any body else; and you cite the opinion of “Robert Walsh, Jr. Esquire,” against me. Very well— I can bear that—I only smile, and hold my tongue.-- But unhappily for you, my silence is misunderstood---misinterpreted. You think the authority of Mr. Walsh has concluded me. You drive me to a defence of my opinion;--- an explanation of it---although you well know, that I do nothing at the halves; and that, if I think a man a blockhead, I never hesitate to say so, whenever I think it worth my while---be he who he may. Mr. Walsh, I am willing to think well of, if you will let me. But beware how you attempt to convince me of too much. The testimony may recoil. Mr. Walsh is mistaken about Mr. Percival. So are you. So are the present conductors of the North American. As for Mr. Walsh, he wants the poetical sense—for it is a sense --the natural feeling for poetry.--So do you.--So do they. Yet I ought to make one exception. The review of Mr. Percival, in the January number of the North American, for 1822, although very cautious, and constrained—is witty and original, and take it altogether is a capital article for that paper. But that for 1823—what shall I say of that? It is altogether too wise and thoughtful— too ridiculously emphatick—as if it were the job-work of some writer, who had just good sense enough to know that, if he did'nt manage well, he would make himself ridiculous, and ruin the author whom he wished to befriend. The first writer is a tolerable judge of poetry—the latter is a blockhead. But Mr. Percival is called a great poet. Ridiculous.--He is a beautiful poet, and that is all. He is passably deep; gentle, tranquil, and uniform. You are never amazed, never alarmed, by anything that he does. He never says anything positively foolish, absurd, or extravagant. It is impossible to make him ridiculous, by a parody, or a travesty. Can he be a poet, then? No—he cannot.— But let me tell you what he is—and what his poetry is. He is a man, who never would have been a poet, or attempted poetry, of his own head, had he been born away from poetical men; or beyond the influence of their example. He would never have thought of poetry, for his own consolation, and still less, for the consolation of another. In one word—he is not a natural poet—although he has a very pure, but timid and fine sense of poetry. So much for the man. Now for his poetry. It is a buried pond of warm water—buried in the woods—unruffled—never turbid—never noisy—never tumbling about— but always teeming with pleasant shadows—birds—water-lilies—clouds—tall green trees—wild flowers, floating about—and shining fish—silent—but not with the silence of a natural solitude—deep, but not with the unsearchable depth of the ocean. You love Percival. So do I. I don't know him; but, he is a bold hearted fellow; and I can't help loving any man, right or wrong, who has the courage to tell men what he believes to be unpalatable truth. True—he is affected—with melancholy, I mean—and so was your William B. Walter; and half a dozen others, who have a notion, that other men would like to be troubled with what they call their “woes”—the extremity of which, in all probability, has been a head-ache---a few hours of foolish despondency---self reproach---or a cholick—a dun —or a criticism—a slight, at a dinner party—or a cut direct—or a disappointment in love or ambition—the love of a simpleton, who had no relish for the abstract and poetical part of a man—and the ambition of being great, where it is always most difficult to be great—among one's playfellows.—Alas, for such men! and alas, for poetry!—for them, if that be all that has come of their being gifted as they are;—and for it, if that be all, that it brings with it—a spirit that will not be comforted—a heart that cannot be contented—a mind that keeps itself from repose, by continual goading; as if it were the sign of a vulgar nature, to be satisfied, in any degree, with any thing in God's providence; and as if, to be happy, were to be unsentimental, and prosaick. But you praise Mr. Percival, more than I. And so does Mr. Walsh. And yet, quere to that....Both of you, it is true, use finer words, and more of them; and call him vol. ii. C greater, than I do. But, I doubt much, if he himself, would think your praise greater than mine. The fact is, that you both want the poetical taste; and he is aware of it. I do not---and, all that he gets from me, therefore, will go to the right place. It will do him good. But that which you are so prodigal of, depend upon it, is more likely to trouble him, than to make him better satisfied with himself. He is obliged to endure it, to be sure. But why?---because Mr. Walsh is the editor of the National Gazette---and you have great influence with the world of fashion---which has all influence with the North American. To judge of poetry, or of any thing, indeed, a man should be a workman, at the same trade. But if he be a workman at the same trade, it will never do for him to find fault with the work of another---ah no!---that, no matter how just it may be, or how evidently well founded, will always be attributed to envy. “Two of a trade can never agree.” So that, if a man be truly a judge---he cannot criticise impartially---he must not. A critick, therefore, must either be ignorant of the subject---or he must praise it, whatever may be the merit of it. Believe me, sir—there is no blast, like untimely approbation; no censure so fatal, as the injudicious praise of men, who do not know where, nor when, nor what to praise. It is ten to one that you blunder upon something that the author has stolen,—or that, he, himself, knows to be so bad, that, if you were anything of a poet, you must have denounced him for it. In the first place—he damns himself—in the next, you. Mr. Percival knows that he is not a great poet:---and, I have no doubt, pities the men that call him so, at the same time that he is offended, at their insensibility to what he is—a beautiful poet. Stay, a moment—I have a question for you. Are you prepared?—You love his poetry —you are familiar with it. You have read it all—now, think well, before you speak. Can you remember half a dozen thoughts, or expressions out of all that you have read? What! are you amazed at the question?—or does your heart fail you?---or your memory?---your memory, per haps you will say, is bad. Nay, nay, man, never attempt to get off, with that plea. A great poet will be remembered---in spite of your memory. You cannot forget him. In every page, notwithstanding the trash and dross, and emptiness and rubbish, there will be some imperishable, indestructible thought, that will engrave itself—like a legend upon your heart—like the motto of a hot coin upon wax. Nay, open the book---open, where you will---and point me to, if you can, a single thought of greatness; or to many of even uncommon beauty. That is a hard judgment—but it is an honest one. Perhaps you will call it envy. Very well—call it envy, if you please. Envy will always defeat itself; and, if my judgment have aught of envy in it—the world will find me out, and punish me for it—and think the better of him, in the long run. Let him be assured of that; and, if he oan persuade himself that I envy him—let him!---I am perfectly willing—it will be a comfort to him. Let him pity and forgive me, as I would, any man that should trouble me in the same way. But let me go through with what I have undertaken, which is, to show that Mr. Walsh, and the North American do not understand poetry—and that, I do:— that, it is perfectly ridiculous for any of you to pretend to talk about it;—and that, I do not despair of making you feel that it is—nor of making you acknowledge, that whatever else you may be, you are not made to sit in judgment upon either poets or poetry. I have read the first number of Mr. Percival's Clio— but I have never been able to get the second, although I have seen an extract from it, which contains the most beautiful thing that he has ever done; it is in the Coral Grove. “The water is calm and still below “There, with its[2] [2] “There, with a waving blade of green,” would be altogether better. Its ought to be avoided, particularly in poetry. waving blade of green, “The sea-flag streams through the silent water; “And the crimson leaf of the dulse is seen, “To blush, like a banner bathed in slaughter:— “There, with a light and easy motion, “The fan-coral sweeps through the clear deep sea; “And the yellow and scarlet tufts of ocean, Are bending, like corn on the upland lea—.” There, my friend, the words that I have underlined have more true poetry, and a thousand times more beautiful originality in them, than any thing else that I have ever met with, of Mr. Percival's. I remember one other thought of his, however, that I will mention here,—and then, away with quotation. It is in the poem on Consumption. “And there is a blending of white and blue, “Where the purple blood is melting through, “The snow of her pale and tender cheek. Now Mr. Walsh would never believe, that the essence of that thought, the beauty of the whole passage—lies in the simple word tender—and that the words—not in italicks, are altogether beneath poetry. Not that they are prosaick, or out of place—I do not mean that—I only mean that the poetry is not there: and that the other words, italicised, are, though beautiful, not half so remarkable, as the word tender in that place—it is like the tender green, of the new earth. It is really wonderful, how instantaneously and happily poetical thought will fashion for itself, a correspondent language. Here the poet let his heart have her own way—he had been touched by the thought, while standing before, or sitting by some sweet girl, dying in a consumption—and he had there seen the purple blood (which, by the way, is bad to any ear not classically familiar with the purple of the ancients;— for, with the multitude, purple is not a blood colour—nor a blue—but a deep violet—Although the ancients meant everything and anything, just as Byron does, by the same word)—melting through it—he thought then of the snow—stained, very faintly, with blood;—and, the language arranged itself—forthwith, so as to be touching and innocent, like the thought. And so it always must be.— Poetical thought does not seek for rhyme—but it always will seek for peculiar expression;—it has a sound of its own—rejecting the more barbarous of our consonants: and delighting in melody and gentleness—or smoothness and strength, even when exalted to sublimity. The first volume of poetry that Mr. Percival (by the way---he was never a lawyer, I believe---although I have often heard that he was) is made up of little pieces and large ones---put together, between the ages of seventeen and twenty-five, or twenty-six. I have just read it; and I am very sorry for it. It has lowered him, beyond all belief, in my estimation, as a poet. I can forgive a child for attempting poetry—but I cannot forgive a man for publishing it. No matter, at what age the poems were written—it is enough for us, that they have been published by the author, when his judgment was mature. That is a very just criticism, take it for all in all, which first appeared in the North American; but it does not go far enough—it is too timid and irresolute; wanting in discrimination, patience, and dignity; and what is more, the author was too much inclined to kindness and pleasantry, for the occasion:—but, be that as it may---he was a fine fellow----a much finer one, believe me, than any other one among you, who dares to talk about poetry, now, so far as I can judge from your late numbers, which I sometimes meet with. A great part of Prometheus, I do not scruple to say, is not only as good as the major part of Childe Harold, but so like it, that I should have pronounced it to be Byron's without hesitation. Mr. Percival, it is true, can walk like Byron---on his midway journeying;---but he cannot go up aloft, like him, and steady himself among the clouds:---nor does he ever grovel so brutally or stupidly as Byron. Let Mr. Percival do his best---and I should say, at a glance---no! that is not Byron. Here is another hand writing. Let Byron do his best, and I should be certain,---instantaneously certain---that nobody but Byron could have done it. But let them both philosophise--- Byron in his own way---and Percival in Byron's way--- and I would defy any man to tell “which was which,” as vol. ii. C 2 we say in New England. Byron's legitimate dominion is a desert. It is the barren, rocky, silent dwelling-place of a stern shadow---an enchanter---who hath forbidden the winds to blow---the waters to run---the clouds to pass over him---or the grass to spring up under him--- lest they might disturb him in his incantations. The territory of Mr. Percival, for it is not a dominion---he is absolute no where---is a beautiful, and vividly green tufted place, all alive with water courses, and parted off, by flowery hedges---into inexpressibly pretty solitudes, in miniature---where, if a man mean to be alone---he must stick his head into the bushes, and stop his ears; where there is nothing awful—nothing that will make a devotee to the solitude chant, or pray, under his natural voice---but everything, to please a fellow that don't like getting wet---or muddy, and yet is fond of green silent places; and the finest echo in the world, for repetition, and prolongation of low and complaining musick. There is not a single ode, song, or sonnet; nay, not a single passage or thought of striking beauty, or peculiar character, in all the poetry that I have yet seen of Mr. Percival's, which I cannot prove to be an imitation of somebody or other, who has preceded him;—and generally, of Byron, Campbell, Milman, and even of some of our Amercan writers. For example—there is, in the first number of Clio, an ode to Greece, which is altogether after Byron—a song, about some raval victory, actually made up of the battle of the Baltick, (“where the boldest held their breath,”) and the Mariners of England; several songs—which are downright imitations of Moore;—and many other passages—many pages—after Milman; particularly one, which is beautiful—insupportable to me, as all imitation is—where he has taken Milman's Italian Wife, (Fazio,) and distilled it into a page. These plagiarisms are not of language, or expression, so much as of thought and manner—nay, many of them are hardly to be called plagiarisms; and ought to be mentioned only in proof, that the author has no strong, prevailing, natural character of his own, or he could not so readily, and would not, so fondly and continually, assimilate himself with the character of every other poet that he gets a glimpse of. It is this facility of adaptation, which will prevent Mr. Percival from ever becoming a great poet; and which, if he be not upon his guard, will finally ruin him for a beautiful one. Nay, that I may not leave anything for conjecture, I will say the whole at once. Mr. Percival is not a poet. You are amazed—you smile; and so does Mr. Walsh. But I rely on the opinion of Mr. Percival's reviewer—(the first one, I mean)—He agrees with me, that, to be less than a great poet, is to be nothing at all. And this cannot be denied; for, exactly in proportion to the pleasure that we receive in poetry and musick, when they are the best; is our intolerant reception of whatever is less than the best. In matters of the understanding, it is not so. We can endure tolerable sour bread—but tolerable sweetmeats are intolerable—we can bear up against pretty good water, but pretty good wine is a little too bad. We can endure bad talking---but bad singing is insufferable, just in proportion to our fondness for what is good. Nay--- to talk of bad poetry, or bad musick, or bad eloquence, is to talk of what, is a contradiction in terms. Believe me—Mr. Percival is an artificial poet. God never meant that he should make poetry. At least, such is my opinion for the present;—and is founded upon his having kept the secret of his power—if he have power---so long, that any man would be pardonable for doubting it. But you may ask where these imitations appear--- and demand to see them---more particularly. Sir— there is no answering such a demand. If you do not instantly perceive the counterfeit---no reasoning will convince you:---You cannot be made to see it---because you must be made to see, at the same time, your own want of judgment hitherto; or, at least your own blindness. “But surely,” you will say---“if these imitations are so plainly to be seen---anybody may be made to see them.” Indeed!—do you know a counterfeit bank note, when you see it? Can you make anybody, and every body, see that it is counterfeit? You can see an imitation in this man— of some other man, whom you know, in his voice, tone, or gait—can you make it evident to another—can you describe it? No. Nor can I describe these plagiarisms of manner in Mr. Percival—they must be felt, instantly— or not at all. I feel them, I see them. I am pained and mortified continually with them; and yet I should despare of making anybody else, but a poet—and a poet too, familiar with all the moderns, perceive them. But what do I think of Byron? you say. Really, my dear sir, I hardly know what to say. I am weary of talking about that man. I think that, as a poet, he is not to be compared with little Tom Moore. But, as a dramatist—as one, that understands the passions—and gives to poetry just the place that it is entitled to, in describing their operation, he is superiour to any man that I can now call to mind. Byron shows to you, the very thing itself—the poet only shows the counterfeit:— one is all fact—the other, all illustration. Byron takes you, by main force, to the base of the pyramid, and commands you to take its altitude—not by measuring the shadow—but the substance. Not so with the poet—he fatigues you with resemblances. But Byron's tragedies, you will think, are sad examples of dramatick talent. Very true. They are a sort of barbarian metaphysicks. But I appeal to his early poems; the finer creatures of the brain, begotten while his heart was in fusion. Then, he was all passion, directness, and scorn, heartfelt scorn, of the empty creatures that beset him. Then he had little or nothing to lose, and every thing to gain. Now, it is exactly the reverse. Now, the kingly drapery that he used to wear, is nearly worn out; and he clings to it, with the desperation of one to his wedding suit, when he has only that left, to remind him of his bridegroom-days, when all the world took hold of hands, and danced round him, as round an idol. Byron's talent is prodigious--- his imagination neither brilliant nor delicate, but strong as death---taste, so, so---sentiment, burning---industry, great, very great, for a poet and a lord. And now, for some of the other great men of the day. In the first place, I would have you know, that this age is, emphatically, the age of poetry; and that,even our common newspaper poets throw out finer poetry—without knowing it—than is ever to be found among the heavy volumes of ancient poetry, numerous and wonderful as they are. Your Wordsworth tickles me, prodigiously. He is a great, plain-hearted, august simpleton. A gifted creature—of prodigious power: a devout dreamer, who cannot, for the soul of him, tell when he is awake; a strong man, with the organs of a child; whose ample and profound thought, can find no correspondent diction. He thinks like an angel, and talks like something less than a man. He is a giant---blind of both eyes---and deaf as a post---who has blundered, somehow or other, into Nature's laboratory---and there goes, groping and rummaging about, most unprofitably for himself, among all the beautiful elixirs of immortality, and crucibles for transmutation---wading into oceans of uncongealed precious stones---ploughing through heaps of rough gold, hardly cool from the furnace---waking strange, subterranean musick, at every step, as he tumbles along, first one way, and then another, among the sources of sound, and harmony, totally insensible to all, one would think; while the very dust that he brings away upon his garments, never fails to enrich those who have the first scouring of them, and picking of him---a matter that keeps a mob of retail dealers in poetry, watching after him, as they watch, in China, after people who are seen to make wry faces;—and when they get him in a corner, they never fail to beguile him of his old clothes---heavy with unknown spoil---and wash him clean, even to the hair of his head---all the time talking baby-talk to him, and profaning his simple majesty, with all sorts of idle and wicked mockery. In short, Wordsworth is not a little like the lump of fresh meat that Sinbad found—rolling about among diamonds—wounding and tearing itself continually—without any profit to anybody, but the creatures that grew dizzy in waiting for him. Wordsworth is altogether a natural poet. Education has done nothing for him, except to make him tedious, childish, obscure and metaphysical. His talent is more sublimated, simple, and clear-sighted, than that of any other man---sentiment, angelick---imagination, altogether subordinate, quite common-place---taste, too pure, periodical, subject to accident, time, place, and the moon---industry, none at all---misunderstood and misapplied. Rogers.—I hardly know what to say of this gentleman. He appears to be an amiable good-for-nothing sort of a man; who declaims downright, incorrigible prose, with such a look of gentle, inward self-satisfaction, that it would be really cruel to laugh at him. And then, too, at times, the man has such an imploring countenance--- such a deprecating tone---that you cannot find in your heart to tell the truth of him, or of his dandy poetry, to his face. But Rogers---heaven be praised---is altogether a made-up poet. No imagination---no talent---pretty taste, and agreeable sentiment---good memory; and a stomach like an ostrich---intellectual stomach, I mean, which can digest anything---find aliment in anything--- and convert anything into what he calls poetry. Southey—Is a natural poet; but altogether destitute of tenderness and sweetness. He is gifted, largely, with a kind of power, that is entirely his own---the power of making great poetry, appear common-place; and common-place poetry, great. He has been too adventurous ---I do not mean, by soaring too high---but, by wandering too far. His course has been sidelong, downward, backward, onward; any way, but upward, for a long time. Ten years ago, he might have been one of the two or three great poets of the age. Now, it is altogether too late. He had a great capacity; but he took in a cargo of inflammable air, for ballast; carried too much sail; and is now in a fair way of abandonment to his old underwriters, for a total loss. More imagination than talent; but his imagination is rather wild, flighty, beakish, and heavy, than beautiful or eagle-pinioned---talent, rather solid than showy---no taste at all---sentiment, hercick, but too epick. Campbell.—Were it not for Hohen-Linden, which was a fine accident—and great, absolutely great, only in one stanza—(“By torch and trumpet fast arrayed”—is the one that I mean;) and Lochell, which is a miracle; and about a dozen lines—not more—here and there, scattered over his Pleasures of Hope; and a part of the Mariners of England, so remarkable for its warlike simplicity;—I should point to Mr. Campbell, as the finest specimen that the world ever saw, of the artificial poet. And, even as it is, with all these exceptions, I am not by any means convinced that he has a downright, natural passion for poety. That he has a good, sound, discriminating judgment of poetry, in the abstract, I cannot deny; but he wants fire, tenderness, simple grandeur, and sensibility. He has all the outward expression, look, and carriage of the poet—the gentlemanly poet—but I do hold him to be badly off, for that inward instinct, which I do not know how to express better, than by calling it Shakspearean: that intuitive, unlabouring, prompt, unthinking, headlong aptitude—quickness—and delicacy of perception, which makes the truly poetical nature, talk poetry, in spite of itself—just as Shakspeare does—when and where poetry is entirely out of place—in the deep, deep drama,—I do not mean in the descriptive, but in the narrative, and active drama. Poetry can be endured in dramatick description—now and then;—but, in dramatick narrative, it is wholly out of place,--and, in dramatick action, absolutely abominable. We can bear to hear a description, in tolerably poetical language---in a general way---of the general effect of being heart-broken;— but when one goes about narrating a particular case, we wince, at every departure from simplicity—and quiver all over with suspicion, or dislike, at the appearance of poetical ornament;---but, if he go one step further, and attempt to show to us---by acting---that his own heart is actually breaking before our eyes---we cannot believe---it is in vain that we would try---we cannot believe---that he is in earnest---if he talk poetically. In short---Campbell's poetry is the poetry of the brain, not of the blood. To my notion, it is the strange product of a strange poetical alchymy. Some one has been trying experiments—in the bright chambers of poetry— while the apparitions were away from their blinding labaratory—and the issue has been, a material, that—without being either diamond or gold in reality, has all the weight of the one, and the glitter of the other. Very fine talent—pure and solid—not malleable—not fusible: —little or no imagination—rather a man of intellect than genius—taste, first rate—but timid and squeamish; easily frightened, and more easily disheartened—sentiment, unexceptionable— industry, worthy of all praise—without being profound or continual. Milton.[3] [3] Or rather, Mr. Milton—for your well-bred, gentlemanly critick, in America, never forgets the title of a man. —A great man—but much learning hath made him mad. He was far too learned—and reasonable —for a poet. He was of that ancient school, who wrestled, and ate, and danced, and slept, in their heavy armour, that it might not be an incumbrance, on the day of battle. He is never without his weaver's beam, and ponderous helmet. At every tread, he crushes—what he is continually calling upon us to admire—the green, spongy earth, and the matted wild-flowers weltering in the light and shadow. If he lean against a tree—in his stately enthusiasm—or lie, all along, upon the broad, heavy grass—the tree is barked by the pressure—and the green earth bruised and crushed into barrenness, by the weight---or scorched into ashes, by the “intolerable” brightness of his armour. Sometimes, when his mail has become too hot for him---he has been seen to throw it off, for an hour or two---untie his “invincible locks”--- and leap away, from before you, like a young man just out of the depth of the blue ocean---strong as a giant---and naked and beautiful as God's own offspring. Give Milton time to prepare---let him know that you are coming ---and, taking the hint, he begins to sit up for company: becomes little else than a tiresome, pompous old fool ---who cannot ask you how you do, but in some unintelligible exhausted idiom; and wears you to death with the legerdemain of gone-by ages---making up for a want of that sweet wisdom, which you have come to see---in the mighty Bard---by a continual display of lofty nothingness. Milton has misunderstood poetry. Various and universal as it is---there is one character, under which it never appears---a learned one. Fire and water will agree better together, than learning and poetry. One is all fact---the other all imagination. One all heat--- the other all coldness. Learning is cold and exact--- poetry hot, loose and careless. Milton had a magnificent angel for a guardian---but neither he nor his angel, had any tenderness of disposition. Both were of that race, who beget their children by sound of trumpet--- and make love, like unicorns---in broad day-light---with all the world looking at the miracle. Miton's talent was absolutely stupendous---his imagination, hardly third ratel—aste, classical---but unnatural---and unfeeling---no sentiment at all. Industry, respectable. Barry Cornwall, (or Proctor.)---The most tender and beautiful creature of the age. His dialect is pure poetry---his very idiom---prattle and gossip—they are all legitimate poetry; he is the very essence and heart of Shakspeare, before Shakspeare was fully grown. I am only afraid that he will become too dainty---too tender ---too sentimental. There is danger of it. He wants nerve---and people are coaxing him, in every direction, to lie a-bed, night and day, and indite to them. He is a natural poet---so true---so gentle---so affectionate. His poetry is of the heart---rather than of the blood or brain. But, all that won't do. He will pall upon the taste, if he don't touch us up, now and then, with something more racy, fiery, and pungent. Talent, sweet, but not strong; ---taste, exquisite;---industry, very good;---imagination, first rate----but more remarkable for delicacy, tenderness, and affectionate beauty, than for brilliancy, or strength;—sentiment, pure and tender, beyond example. Moore.—The best trained singing bird that God, and man together, ever made. He is the first and the last of his family. There will never be another, who will whistle, so like nature—through all the delicate entanglements of art. The Bird-Waltz was made for him. No such combination of plumage and note was ever imagined before;—and then, the creature dances; keeps time with his feet; and gets through the most complicated vol. ii. D minuet, all at the same time, as if dancing were as natural to him, as singing. Moore makes less use of poetical language, than any body else—his words are never fine, or grand—but always very simple, natural, and familiar. People overlook that wonderful talent. Moore is never great—never altogether natural—but he is always happy, familiar—shining, adroit, and graceful; with the purest notion of song poetry in all the world. He is the rarest combination of the thrush, linnet, nightingale, and canary;—without being like either—he resembles them all. He attempts, now and then, to fly perpendicularly upward, into the very sky—but he can't —he can't;—the golden chain, and the golden spots upon his plumage, weigh him down again—and he cannot, though he burst every tiny blood vessel of his little heart, he cannot get beyond the atmosphere of the flower garden, and the beaks of butter-flies. Talent, pure gold— little or no fire;—imagination, exquisite—but of the insect tribe—sentiment, voluptuous, altogether sensual; —taste, unrivalled, for perfection and aptitude;—industry, very uncommon; about no. 2, among poets. Montgomery.—He is one of your honest, plain dealing, solemn, gentlemanly, christian poets—a good man —who must be tolerated, wherever you find him. He is one of a dozen—although he least resembles the master—whom Wordsworth has had the spoiling of;—but he is the only one, who has not grown the richer by it. —No poet, either by nature or art. Talent, good;--- taste, so, so---sentiment, so, so---industry, quite commendable. Coleridge.---Here is a precious fellow! His friends are mad about him---and his enemies with him. He was meant for one of the best poets, that ever went astray--- like an angel, with his wings clipped---among the vulgar creatures of the earth; until, for so it is, with Colridge ---he had forgotten his own heavenly language, and learnt the gibberish of the schools; forgotten the metaphysicks of the sky, and taken up with the perplexities of the earth. Heaven help him! His Ancient Mariner is a perpetual wonder---even for its touches of foolishness; for it is the foolishness---not of humanity---but of something divine. Talent, dreamy, uncertain, doubtful;--- imagination, wild, beautiful, strange;---taste, metaphysical; alternately, divine and earthly---above the highest ---or below the lowest---1000---or less than zero;---no industry at all. Milman—A stately creature, who, unfortunately for himself, was caught young, before he had attained his full growth—thrust into a mould, to which he has grown altogether too scrupulously, as I think. I like neither your long-headed people—nor your long-eared ones—when they are made by pressure and weight. I had rather see a man unnaturally crooked—than unnaturally straight. The first may be nature, after all; the latter cannot be. Samor, tedious as it is—is a greater poem than Paradise Lost. Milman, some how or other, has the knack of diluting solid gold—or beating it, as you would eggs, into a golden foam, or a vapour. Leaf-gold is not thin enough for him—he would have it so essentially combining with the very atmosphere, that, after any disturbance in heaven, he might find it again, if he should want it-- see all the earth sprinkled with it, again.---Pick it up if you can—it slips through your fingers like quick-silver, or vanishes, like the gold of a butterfly's wing. You are rich, as you believe, in what you have been hoarding— but when you yourself are pinched—or choose to pinch that, you will find, generally, that there is only a metallick brilliancy on the end of your fingers—a little humming-bird-dust at the bottom of your strong box. So with the poetry of Milman—his late poetry, I mean. It is amazingly beautiful—but very superficial. The language, to be sure, is solid enough—and there is enough of it. But the real poetry of thought, is neither weight nor measure. Talent, strong—not showy—imagination, respectable and stately; taste, scriptural—formal—but dignified— industry, great. Hunt—is a prodigy. He is a most living supply of poetry. He drinks it up, as from a fountain. Every sense is alive to it—but he is getting qaite too dainty and affected. He has trifled with his gift, until he has made all his poetical senses, a by-word to other men, and a torment to himself. He is not a great poet—and, therefore, if I am right in my doctrine, respecting poetry, as applied to Mr. Percival—he is no poet at all. But that won't do. The proposition must be wrong, which leads to such a result. I had better see first, what I mean by great poetry. Is it grand, daring, tempestuous poetry— or is it, perfect poetry in its way. If the former, then there have been but few, very few poets among men.— If the latter, then are Percival and Hunt, poets—great poets—because both of them are very great, in their little way. So---I take back what I said of Percival. He is a poet—a great poet—within his natural element;—not great in dimensions, amplitude, or elevation; but great in his perfection---which sort of greatness, most people are best able to comprehend. A great jeweller to them—like a great astronomer---is only that one, who is among the best, at the trade. Hunt's peculiarity, is a miraculous sense of beauty and affinity, in language---a miraculous power of appropriation. He goes through the dictionary with a divining rod---that will find every drop of fine poetry, wherever it may be hidden---and tremble over it—till it be dug out.-- Thus, he tells you of--- “— the little whiffling tones, “Of rills among the stones.--- “Where the fountain's tongue begins to lap.” And, of “The rounder murmur, glib and flush “Of the escaping gush.” Now---a man that had never seen a little fountain--- with the tongue out---like a young puppy---just running over, by starts, at one edge---would get a correct idea of it, from that;---and understand just the sort of muttered musick that would come from it. Hunt is foppish; affected and childish; but nevertheless, a most exquisite creature. Let me state a case.---He wants to describe the sunshine, after a shower, when the rain fell upon the dry leaves, like “twangling pearl,” trembling through the green tree-tops, upon the fine grass below. How does he do it? Hush!---There was a little “strawy fire,” he says; “a little golden ferment in one place.” Such is Hunt; full of such queer, lucky, hazardous, unpremeditated adventure. My friend---there is one drop of pure poetry in the heart of every living creature---but, like the tear of an angel---which every pearl has within it---it may never be seen, except on the happening of some poetical accident. Stop---let me convince you of it. You fancy that you have a taste for poetry---wait five minutes, and I will put that drop in motion---and then, you will be satisfied, from the sensations that follow, that you have hitherto mistaken classical rhyme---for the musick of heaven;---the heavy talking of men, that are dead, for poetry. But first, of Hunt---Talent of the finest, incapable of undergoing analysis, escaping in the test---imagina tion, unexampled in its fineness, but limited---destitute of grandeur---taste exquisite, unequalled, but apt to be sickly and affected---industry —. Let me attempt to show you, by this very example, of a little sunshine spattered upon the grass, the difference between several of the ancient and modern poets. I will try to tell it in the manner of each. Hunt, you may see, with his head in the bushes; holding on by his ruffles, with one hand; looking at the place with quick, shining eyes, just like a child watching the progress of a lightening bug through wet, green moss.-- He tells you that there is a little golden ferment there. But Wordsworth would say, standing solemnly over it, all the while, and speaking like one---a very wise man --trying to make a mysterious thing intelligible to a child. He would say— vol. ii. D 2 I stood and saw the beautiful wet earth, Just where the sunshine fell; and then I thought, Of earth impregnate with divinity—&amp;c. &amp;c. That is enough for our purpose---it is just after his fashion; but he would have gone along, for a whole page, telling us of renewed vitality---the germinating principles of immortality--&amp;c. &amp;c. likening it to that very place, just as if he did'nt see how it was possible not to see the resemblance. But Rogers.---There he is. I see him---there he stands, gently inclining his ear toward the place---his eyes turned to a great city, that can just be seen, through the wood---toes out---a nice little rattan in one hand--- his watch chain in the other, in the attitude of one recollecting, rather than uttering, spontaneously, a fine description---Rogers would say— That, erst upon a time, the lord of light, Divine Apollo, from his quiver shot His golden shafts among the pearly dew, &amp;c. &amp;c. Southey would gallop to the spot, on horse-back--- cut a few capers---till he'd got the mob around him;---dismount---stand like one, that had prepared himself to do something extempore; and then tell you---either that Apollo had slain a dragon there---or that a fountain of fire was about to find its way through the earth---or— that— The showering urn above, had overflowed; And deluged that dark spot with golden light. Campbell would step forward, like one afraid of wetting his feet---with a gold and green hunting net over his shoulder, full of strangled singing birds—pull away the branches, very gently, so as to get a fair shot;---seat himself, carefully---take out his common place book--- look for the index---word sun---sunshine---sun-light;--- and then, taking dead aim for a subject, at the little “golden ferment,” determine to make it his own, if his ammunition held out, though he had to sit there all day long.--- Observe him---he is keeping time with his fingers---and humming the air to himself---while he is making the poetry ---before he puts pen to paper. Ah!---he begins to write--- very well---onward he goes---no blotting, no blurring--- now---hush!---He is beginning to read what he has written. The thing is'nt finished yet---he must take it home and polish it up:---at present, you can only hear something about the quiet place---the tender green---made lovely by the pale checkered lustre of the day-light---made doubly brilliant too, by companionship with the surrounding shadow---just like---that shadow upon our mortal pilgrimage, which is given to us---even in solitude,---to make light and harmony more welcome to us. But Shakspeare! What would he say. He!---I'll tell you.---In the first place, you would find him barefooted---bare-legged---wet to the skin---a nest of young nightingales in his bosom---and live birds all about him ---lying, all along, upon his face---over the great roots of a leaning, ivy-covered tree---the green, wet leaves flapping in his face---the wind blowing his fine hair all about his eyes---whistling and talking to himself, all the time ---or telling his birds, in their own language, that the rising-sun had been bird-nesting there—impregnating the wanton earth, and heated world—with his own lavished brightness; and that the issue would be a crop of scented violets, cowslips, butter cups—and dainty field-flowers— such as they might peck at, till their little hearts were full. He is the poet of nature. His poetry is that of the blood —altogether of the blood. The little education that he had, only spoilt his poetry—without making him wiser. There is a very wantonness, and, untameable levity in his imagination, that would have made him the chief of poets —had he lived in a poetical age—and, perhaps, the chief of dramatists, when weary of poetry. Ah!—I had forgotten!—Little or no judgment—no decided talent—unbounded imagination—exquisite sentiment—no taste at all, as the world goes—but the most natural taste in poetry—little or no industry. All that he has written is not six month's work. Barry Cornwall—would entreat to remain a while, and listen to the yearning, in the quiet grass—the gold and green fibres, intertwining at the very root—like delicate tendrils, put out and flowing from the heart of love, when touched with sudden sympathy---the fire of ambition with the young green of first and familiar love. But Barry Cornwall would lie there---half asleep, half sobbing---not at full length---nor in a place where there was any danger of taking cold. Milton.---Let me see. I can hit him off, I am sure. Wait a moment. He would stand upright, one hand, with a glove on, in his bosom---for he is a man that could not bear to touch his own flesh, nakedly---unceremoniously--- his face, forehead, hair---all set to musick---his voice deep---far off;---the other hand holding a telescope, tall “as Norway pine,” through which he would be contemplating the golden ferment---and persuading himself that there was a war among the constellations of heaven.---He would tell you---off hand--- That, the rejoicing sun, aloft in heaven, Again, the voice omnipotent obeyed--- And struck the opaque orb, by men called earth, Forever teeming planet! and a fire, Prone, to the centre of the trembling ball, Insatiate, fruitful, there had lighted up!— And now for Moore. He would not come to the place at all. A drawing of it, would do for him---a secondhand sight of it. He would be found lolling about, in some musical saloon, when the time came, up to his knees among roses---musical boxes---fiddles---pianos---and Canary birds;---thrushes---bulfinches---larks and mocking-birds---all tame, tame as death---not a wild bird among them---not an Eolian harp within gun-shot. Describe the place to him---and, after a few moments had passed, during which, he would want you to believe that he does'nt hear a syllable that you are saying---coquetting and fingering all the while, upon a nice little gold and ebony guitar, embossed with seed pearl, which he has persuaded himself are veritable dew-drops that people get sprinkled with, by playing early and late, to the nightingale, half buried in wet shrubbery---he would come out upon you, with an impromptu---as if he had just thought of it ---words, musick and all---somewhat after this fashion— The sun-shine, that fell In the midst of a shower, Will spring up anew In blossom or flower, More beautiful far, for the shadow about it; Like the light of the eye, When the lashes are wet With the shadow of love, That we cannot forget; A light that is nothing, O, nothing without it! O, believe me, the ray That is dampened with dew, Like the lustre above, In that beautiful blue, Is mingled up so, that we never may doubt it! Then, woman, smile on, But, unless thou wilt weep, 'Tis the smile of the dead, When their eyes are asleep, And we are more touched by the moonlighted rain; Or, the quick-silver dew, In the heart of a flower, Or the dim. gentle light Of untenanted bower, Where we look and we listen forever in vain! We had rather peep in, When a twinkle is there, Like feathers of gold In the rainy blue air, When the flight of a wet bird is just like a stain. Then woman weep on--- Pshaw!---I had quite forgotten myself; Moore would have finished the whole affair, in ten or a dozen lines---and I was in a fair way to make a poem of it. He would have made the parallel, too, altogether more complete. The first ten or fifteen lines, are very like him, to be sure ---except that he might have said, in double rhyming--- The light fell, like rain In the midst of a shower; But sprung up again, In blossom and flower. That would have been more familiar, and playful— and, therefore, more in his manner; but, the rhyming would have been false;---again rhymes with men---except when poets are hard pushed. Still, however, Moore would not have boggled at it, although, among the purest rhymers that now live;---I do not say that ever have lived; for, in old times, it was quite a strange thing to see ten honest rhymes, in the same page. The next thought---about the tears of the dead---or the smile of the dead, when the eyes are asleep, is quite too strong poetry for Moore---except when, by some accident, he has been surprised into it, by the rhyme. He could not say “when the blood is asleep,” for example; or “when the mouth is asleep;” but he might, in a gentle way, have alluded to the lips of the dead---of them that are smiling, like children asleep. So, too, the latter part is better poetry---finer than, but not so natural, or so familiar as, you would find in Moore. What I was about to say, however, (bating that I wanted to compare the quick-silver dew, in the heart of the passion-flower--to a gentle sweat--seen only on the shade and blackness of that flower,) would have been more like him. I wanted to put a bird into the bower....or a woman weeping; and I meant to show that the bright plumage—bright tears--- bright eyes—bright breast-pin, (if nothing else would do, for women will wear jewels, for the sake of the rhyme, whenever they were requested to—wherever they may be in bower or bed—overboard or asleep—dead or dying)— were all the brighter for the surrounding shadow; so that, on peeping into the dark bower, you would see nothing but an occasional sparkle—a tear falling—or a little bright down, dropping like fire, from the bird, as he sat, pluming himself, after the shower; but hang it—I could not--- the thought came into my heart—how very like a stain on the sky, was the flight of a swift, brilliant little bird, when it flies low; with its red and green, or clear golden plumage, wet with the rain—and in I popped it, as well as I could---forgetting all the world beside, and not caring a fig for Tom. Moore---or the business in hand. Another thing is, that Moore would have shown— demonstrated—so that you could never forget it—and would wonder how it happened, that you had never thought of it before—that the process of fructification in the earth—after the sunshine and rain had fallen upon it, together, was precisely like that of the human heart— when the light of fine eyes, wet with weeping, had fallen upon it; and that the flowers of the heart must spring up, in both places, for every rain-drop, at least, a handful of blossoms. Another fault of Moore's—and a quite unpardonable one too, in a song writer---nay, in a poet---or in any writer, is, a s ort of carele ss ne ss, a s regard s the con s onant s; Nothing frets a delicate ear, like it. Let me attempt to avoid it, by a new modification of the poetry above---a few lines only---so far as it can be done without affectation; and see the difference, then, not only in singing it, but, in reading it. The warm light that fell On the earth, in a shower, Will come up anew, In a beautiful flower; More beautiful, far, for the shadow around it. But, enough of Moore. Now for Milman. After walking round and round the subject, a day or two, without coming one inch the nearer to it, continually intrenching himself as he went, like one beleaguering a citadel, with blank verse, to be sent in, by a herald and trumpet, he would heave up his forehead, plant his feet, and pronounce— The bright, majestick sun—to be in heaven! A glory on the earth! A mystery and a miracle! The solitary gloom and wilderness Untenanted and dim, about to be, With trouble and with travel, lighted up By some foretold conception—a bright hirth— A sceptred infant—. And Montgomery would say—the quiet good soul— that, Our own heavenly One above, Had come, in his benignity, Just like the light of day above, Quivering through the lofty tree— Taking care to make the reality, only a secondary thought; and the secondary thought, the resemblance, suggested by the sunshine upon the grass, altogether the principal. So that, one would believe, not that the sun-shine had suggested the thought of heavenly beneficence, but that the beneficence of heaven had suggested the thought of the sunshine. Byron would tell you—muttering, to himself— although determined to be overheard, and occasionally looking under his eye brows, to see who was listening —and sternly regarding the place—that, the earth had the heart-burn—that, God had struck it—that, it was all blackness and ashes—blasted, to the centre—that, blood had been spilt there, in olden time—and that, nothing but fire could purify the place. And Scott would tell you—his neck and bosom all open, and the wind and mist of the Scotch mountains blowing into it, till his teeth chattered, That, through the trees, the downward sun, Where dark a little streamlet run, (no matter whether true or not—it's only a part of the rhyme.) Fell, like a lustre trembling through, And glittered on the passing blue Of that mysterious gurgling stream, In one continual silvery gleam; And, o'er the stunted grass and flower, Like moonlight o'er deserted bower, Showing how fair and desolate Could be the place where she had sate. There, my dear sir---I have tired myself to death; and I hope now, that you are convinced of it, by sympathy, and are willing to acknowledge...that one or the other of us, at least, is no judge of poetry. ED: MOLTON.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SARAH TO JOHN. Waterville, Kennebeck River. Really, cousin John, your silence is unaccountable. Not a line, not a single line, from either of my two new brothers, except one, that was almost illegible, from Frank, written in pencil, upon a dirty bit of paper, which I had half a mind to smoke, (or fumigate, I must say now, I suppose, being at chymistry,)---the amount of which scrawl was, that he was on the deck of the vessel —the pilot just ready to depart—no time to say good bye to anybody—still less to write;—that you were “worse off,” than ever, with Molton---a phrase which I take to mean, that you were on a footing of greater intimacy, than ever, with him;---and that he hoped all would go well with you, yet. Just in this state of suspense, came a letter that is utterly indistinct, and inexplicable, from Juliet. Her name is to it, but the hand-writing is not hers; or, if it be, she must have been strangely disordered at the time. All that I can decypher, amounts to this:--- vol. ii. E “Dear Sarah---Do not believe a word that you hear. Trust to me---to me, alone. Believe nothing, that does not come to you, in black and white, signed with my name. I shall write to you, the first moment; but, at present, I have no time. I am sick---sick at heart, Sarah; but I put my trust in heaven. Farewell. Whatever you hear, remember, I charge you, to disbelieve it; no matter from whom it may come---no matter how plausible it may appear---until you hear from me. “J. R. G.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">On looking again at the signature, I am inclined to doubt it. She usually signs her name Juliet, but here is her name at length--and then, the whole is obliterated, and her initials put over it. Indeed, I am sure, on examining it, that the name first written, was not Gracie What it was, I know not---some trick, I suppose; and I shall give myself no further trouble about it. Tell Juliet, however, that we may meet again, after all; and, on much more comfortable terms, than we have lately expected. I have good reason to believe that the estate is not so desperate as we feared. O, I must not forget to tell you of a new freak, that has got possession of me. I have taken up my drawing again; and I mean to continue it. There is a man here, no great things I imagine, who advertises, at the tavern, to teach drawing; and some of his sketches, that were obtained for me, are singularly spirited; yet they have not the air of an experienced or confident hand. At any rate, I shall be entertained; for, his appearance is rather favourable, and his manner much above that of the people about us. In such a place, so barren of incident, you cannot imagine what a bustle the appearance of a stranger will create. That, which I caused, has not yet entirely subsided; and now, his arrival, though he has been expected, it seems, for a long while, from some of the viliages lower down the river, Hallowell or Augusta, has electrified the whole population. All the girls here, and there are multitudes, indeed, are devoutly engaged in the subject He teaches writing, too, in some short hand way, by machinery, perhaps---(for some of the yankees teach grammar by a machine; and others, by a map;---I have seen them both, and they are truly wonderful and useful contrivances.) Do you remember an invention, about the size of a dumb Betty, that was in New-York, once; the inventor of which, called it the Pedagogue;—a child of five years old could work it, by turning a crank;—it would keep a large school in order—whip the boys, rule the books, and mend the pens. The principle, I think, was Lancasterian. But enough of this nonsense. I have begun the study of chymistry—taken up my Italian, and Botany again; and thus, by a fair division of time, between them, and this drawing master—O, I forgot to tell you that he takes likenesses in Indian ink—I shall be continually employed. Send me any books that you can, anything new; you know what I want, by mail. Tear off the covers, and they travel as pamphlets. I learnt this secret from an author. The drawing master has just left me. There is something in his appearance that reminds me of somebody, I can't, for my life, tell whom. His name is Randolph. He converses well, but with the most astonishing rapidity. I foresee a good deal of entertainment in his company; and he seems very anxious for my favourable opinion. At least, I judge so, from some little trepidation that he manifested, as I took off my eyes, after looking at him steadily, just now, for some moments. I love to look into people's faces, when they are talking:—it appears to me that I can read their hearts, then, in their eyes. Another symptom that I discovered—O, the vanity of women!—was that, look up when I would, from my work, for I was drawing when he came, I always found his eyes rivetted upon mine. There was a strange, troubled, wild expression in them I thought; but it soon passed off; and, before he left me, we were on the pleasantest terms in the world. But, let me try to describe them. They are, as I have told you before, strange eyes. I do not know another word in our language, that will express anything like what I mean. They are not wild —nor beautiful—nor very bright—nor awful—nor melancholy;—but, on the whole, are so altogether unlike any that I have ever seen, as to deserve exactly, I think, to be called strange eyes. Under the lashes, which are neither heavy nor dark, there is a continual shadow and ripple—alternations of light and darkness, of exceeding vivacity and suddenness—just as you may have seen— bless me! how extravagant I am getting!—I shall forfeit my New-England character, forever—just, for all the world, like the shadow of a willow-tree, over deep water; shifting, incessantly, from exceeding brightness to a death like dimness—and then, instantly, all its depth illuminated again, so that you can see the population swarming about, and all the clouds of heaven passing, and repassing therein! In short, there is “a bright blue, rippling glitter,” (as Milman has it, when speaking of heavenly armour,) continually issuing from under his droll-looking eye-lashes, when he is much excited. Don't tell Juliet this; or, if you do, please to add the antidote;—he has an ugly profile, and a sad pale face; and—and, I do not think him exactly the most fashionable young man in the world. They say that he is from Boston. He looked at my drawing;---and, as I confess I expected, for you know that I am a little vain in that matter, and particularly of my colouring, since what Signor Petutti said to me---he appeared a good deal astonished. Yet, he made no scruple to point out the faults. Thought I, to myself—young man, let me have a peep at yours; and see if I be not a match for you, in criticism. Good bye. He is certainly intelligent—and, when he is talking, rather handsome, I think; at least, his face is animated, and incessantly changing. Love to Juliet. Tell her to write to me, immediately, without grace; and, as for you, at your peril, keep me informed of all that is going on between Grenville and her. Yours, my dear cousin, as you behave, S. R. P. S.—I have done signing my name at length. Juliet has taught me more prudence. It would be an awkward thing, if any of my letters, with my signature, should miscarry. S. R.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">vol. ii. E 2 JULIET TO SARAH. Yes, my dear Sarah, I am married. A new state of being, full of obligation and solemnity, is open to me. The man that I have chosen---nay, I can hardly say that I have chosen him, for it seems rather, as if heaven, in its compassion to me, had thrown him in my way, and made it necessary for me to fly to him for protection,---is a man of integrity---and talent. We were married precipitately; and, I assure you, my dear sister, very unexpectedly; yet, at present, I am not at liberty to disclose the transactions that led to it. I should be sorry to suspect him, of having countenanced any part of them; and his conduct has been so uniformly respectful, and kind; so affectionate even, that if he have had any hand in them, I am persuaded that it was out of tenderness to me. Perhaps he may have permitted something of cruelty and—nay, this is a manner unworthy of me, either as his wife, or as your friend, Sarah; and so, I shall say no more about it, until I can relate all the particulars.— You will hear that I eloped with Mr. Grenville. It is not true; nor, would I take the trouble to contradict it, were there not some other reports in circulation, which would seem to corroborate that. Nay—the very improbability and extravagance of a story have been to me, heretofore, a reason for believing that there must have been some foundation for it. For, when people invent a falsehood, you know that they generally try to give it an air of probability. You will hear also, that our marriage was private, and unexpected. That is true. Four hours before it took place, there seemed little likelihood, I declare to you, that I should ever be the wife of Mr. Grenville. Would you believe it?—There are some cruel slanders in circulation respecting me, the extent of which I have no kind, good-natured friend to inform me of. Perhaps, I may get them more directly from you. Tell me what they are, without fearing to wound me. My heart is not easily wounded of late—continual laceration has destroyed its sensibility. It is nearly callous. Of one thing, however, I may venture to inform you. You know my reluctuance to marriage. I intended to live and die, alone. Yet—such was the humiliation, the cruelty, that I have experienced of late, that even marriage, marriage with a stranger, was a relief to me.— You must not doubt Sarah, that I love my husband. No —had I not loved him, I never would have married him, under any consideration; but, no matter how much I had loved him, had I been left free to choose for myself, I would never have married him—never! He knows this. I have used no concealment with him; and he has married me, I verily believe, from a feeling of heroick generosity. He was willing to be my friend—my dearest friend. He deserved to be; and there was but one way. We had often reasoned of the past—the present, and the future. I respected him for his honesty; and, perhaps, loved him, because he loved me; and, because there was such a considerate delicacy in his love. He was never obtrusive--- never capricious; and throughout, had dealt with me like an honest man. But now we are married; and I shall endeavour to make him happy. Ah, my dear Sarah! it is, indeed, no light natter, this undertaking— to be the partner of another, in heart and spirit, forever and ever. I tremble, when I think of it; and I should sink into the very earth, if I could reproach myself with any concealment. But no—there is none---none! He is master even of some of the wretched slanders, in circulation against me—but he has the magnanimity to smile at them,—ah—my husband calls me. I will return in a moment— Sarah! I have scarcely the power to hold my pen.— That man, that bad man—he, whom I never meant to name again—Molton, has been with us. What can it portend? Several hours have passed; but, I am yet so agitated, that I can hardly keep my hand upon the paper. When I entered the room, he stood fronting the door. He bowed, without any emotion. Mr. Grenville, I thought, manifested a good deal of perturbation. Mr. Molton asked me, if it were true, that Jane had shut her door against me; one evening when Mr. G. and I had been taking a walk. I answered, reluctantly, yes.— “Madam,” said he, “I do not come to alarm you. My errand is one of peace. I have been conversing with your husband, and I respect him.” (It was said with emphasis; and, coming from Edward Molton, I confess that it did my heart good.) “I was not surprised to learn from him that you had communicated the whole, the whole, madam, that ever transpired between us. This was wise. It will prevent misinterpretation, slander, or unkind feeling, hereafter. I was willing to see you once more;—but I chose that your husband should be present. You have been slandered; and I have my share, I find, in the calumny. For myself, that were nothing, but while I have breath, Juliet—Ma—Madam—Mrs. Grenville, I mean---no human being shall breathe any slander upon your name. Pardon me—I see that it distresses you; but, I have the traducer in my own power. Your husband did not know the extent of these atrocious calumnies, until I communicated them to him. For some things, that he did, I blame him; but, these were consequences that he could not foresee---and his love—and love madam, where it does not debase, enables and consecrates like divinity—his love made him wander. Farewell. I shall probably never trouble you again. You have both an ill opinion of me. I am sorry for it; but I do not blame you; and it is hardly worth while, at my age, and in my state of health, to—Sir, your wife had better sit, I think—(Indeed I could hardly stand) to disturb the consciences or the hearts of them that slumber--unless, indeed, I were sure that they would be the happier for it. You will not see me again—but you will hear from me, in a few days too, I hope. Farewell.” He passed my husband, who shook him cordially, very cordially by the hand;---and as he passed me—what could I do-it was probably the last time-we had never parted before, even in our anger, without it. I put mine into his. He appeared surprised---touched--and he relinquished it, very gently. “What am I to think of this,” Mr. G. said to me---the first words that he spoke. “Is that the man Juliet?” I stammered a little, I verily believe;---but, nevertheless, I was able to articulate a faint yes, at last.--- “By heaven!” said he---“he is a most extraordinary being.” Farewell! Sarah. Tell me what to do, or think. JULIET R. GRENVILLE. P. S. You see a little ostentation, I suppose, in the name. I cannot help it. I want to get accustomed to the whole length of it---to the sound and sight of it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">EDWARD MOLTON TO GEORGE STAFFORD. Once more, dear Stafford, I find myself in communion with you. My heart acknowledged the approximation; and it began to vibrate with unusual spirit, while I was tracing your name. I have experienced much since I saw you, much to weary and chafe a nature like mine; and something, perhaps, though not much, to darken it. One thing I have learnt, in bitterness; and that is, that there is a resisting power within the human heart-- a sort of incompressibility, which renders it stern as adamant, when it is beset, alike, on all sides. At a single shock, it quivers to the core; to a slight pressure, it yields. But, increase the pressure;---repeat the shock;---encompass and envelope it, all about, with an atmosphere of fire, and heaviness; and it beats boldly and freely again--- like something alive, in the deep water---or our pulses in the wind. What is the property, that upholds us, at such an hour? Is it that God hath given to us, hidden and secret energies, which are only to be developed in desperation? How many have died in imbecility, who, had they been taught to wrestle upon a precipice, had been giants? Our faculties—what do we know of them? Do they not spring up and lighten, against oppression and darkness; yet perish away, and wane, under the more gentle and delicate ministering of the elements? No, Stafford. To become acquainted with our own strength, we must be put to it, for life and death. No man ever knew the use of his muscles, till he had fallen from a steep, and caught; been thrown overboard, or shipwrecked.— We can't learn to swim on a table. Make a creature desperate; and who can withstand it? The mother in her ire; the wild beast in its wrath; the tamest creature of the farm-yard; how formidable it will become, when the instinct of its power is disturbed. So is it with us. And it were impious to complain of those trials, which have given manhood and aspect to our virtues. Without affliction; without trial, discipline, and sorrow, where was there ever a great man?—or a great virtue? Not upon this earth. The strongly rooted are only known in the strong wind. The great men of the world, are those, who have arisen in her tribulation. They are sparks, elicited by the concussion of society—convulsed and shaken to its foundation. Let us not complain, then, my dear Stafford, if we are visited with somewhat that gives dignity to virtue. But let me leave this. I am now engaged in a serious enterprise; and, as I have promised one or two letters of this sort, it would be well, I think, to remember them now, lest any accident, such as I have lately escaped from, should incapacitate me. But first, let me reply to a postscript in your last, which I overlooked; probably, because it was written on the very last fold of the paper. You ask what I mean by calling all your classical writers, cockney-writers.— Hear my answer. In the first place, your cocknies are in the habit of dropping the h in pronunciation. So do your classical writers. Let me convict them, out of their own mouths. All of them are continually writing an before words beginning with an h aspirated, as herald, heroick, house, harlot, heaven, &amp;c. Now this could never have happened—(for men write by the ear, more than by the eye; and those, who write rapidly, often say two, for too, or to—and formally for formerly, and vice versa) —unless they were in the habit of pronouncing these words, in conversation, 'erald, 'eroick, 'ouse, 'arlot. Talking-cocknies are bad enough, heaven knows;—but what are writing-cocknies, who have time to deliberate; and ought to know better? I cannot forgive them. But, perhaps, you may think this an exaggeration. Try it—take up any book that you will, from Shakspeare down to, to—stop, here is Crabbe. Now, I defy you to open a page, without finding one or more of these bow-bell-provincialisms. There!—what did I tell you? Here I find an 'oliday; an 'elping 'and; an 'ouse; an 'ill, (for a hill;) an 'uge 'igh 'ouse; an 'eart, &amp;c. &amp;c. Very well. Now, let us open the Bible. I take it down from the shelf. I open it, by chance. I find, almost without looking for it—for my eye is attracted by such a thing, just as by bad spelling; or by a letter turned upside down— “a city standing on an 'ill.” There is Burke—the great Burke. I open at a letter to Charles Lee, Feb. 1, 1774. “I already have an 'igh esteem,” he says. Let us try Bacon. “Men an hungred, i. e. an 'ungered, do love to smell hot bread,” says he. Now open Johnson's Dictionary—look for the illustrations of any word, beginning with h, and tell me if I have been too severe. Thus much on that head. I proceed to allege other examples in proof. It is exceedingly common with your classical gentry, ancient and modern—but, especially, with the modern, and more particularly with the poetical class— to say wert for wast; sate for sat; drank for drunk; and some other words, about as barbarous, for others purely and beautifully English. Dryden says, or said; for latterly, they have discovered the blunder, and arrested it, at the expense of the rhyme;— Aloft in awful state, The godlike hero sate! Byron still perseveres; and so do several of your moderns, particularly Moore and Barry Cornwall; and all of ours, who, like Mr. Percival, are addicted, grosly, to Byron. By the way, you have a she-poet among you, with a more brilliant plumage, and a finer song, by far, than any female that I ever heard of---and far superior to most of your males. She is the author of Legends of Lampidosa---and is called Mrs. Lehman, I believe. Byron too, and all of that school; nay, about nine out of ten, among all your poetical writers, ancient and modern, are in the continual habit of saying they had drank, for they had drunk---“Thou wert lovely,” for thou wast lovely; corrupted from a beautiful use of the subjunctive, wert thou lovely: and more than one, too, are in the habit of blundering, forever, in the use of the verbs to sit and to set---to lay and to lie. Thus, Byron writes lay, instead of lie; for a rhyme, too, in one of those magnificent stanzas, in his disorderly apostrophe to the Ocean, at the end of his fourth canto, of Childe Harold. “And dashest him again to earth---there let him lay. Who knows, but some future commentator may reform that; and make the line terminate in lie? It, or something very like it, has already been done, with Dryden, we see. Another of the cockney-tricks, continually practised by your great men, is this—whenever they are puzzled for a rhyme, they change either the pronunciation of a word, the tense, or the manner, from solemn to familiar; or, from familiar to solemn. They will make wand rhyme with hand—wrath with path—flood with wood;—and, choosing the solemn style of thee and thou, for all occasions, they cannot bear to follow it up; are willing to say thou art, or thou wilt—but not, thou shouldst or thou wouldst; but you should, or you would, as more manageable in poetry. Such men will say, for example— “Thou art more lovely than the clear-eyed day; “And should you not, with like enduring ray. Or— “He came; and on the topmost mountain stood; “And sees the winds encountering on the flood; “And upward throws his golden wreathed wand, “And bent the index of supreme command.” Does this appear so very absurd? By heaven, I can point cut more abominable sacrifices to an indolent temper, in any poet of your country. I next charge all of your writers—all—I make no exception, with a total disregard to the niceties of punctuation—nay, with having no law at all. Dr. Blair, himself, has no steadfast rule; and, as for the rest, they point their own writing, in such a manner, as to prove, that they have never thought upon the matter. Men may differ, to be sure, in style; but, they may as well differ in orthography, as in punctuation. Another common blunder—which is only a refinement upon cockneyism, among them, is of the following kind. An abandonment of the infinitive, for some round-about modification. They never say, for example, when they mean, that a man expected to be at a place;—but always, that he expected to have been; and so, too, although I admit that to be quite an unsettled matter—they are always blundering in the subjunctive mood. They say, if he was, if he is, when they mean, if he were, if he be.— The best rule perhaps, without regard to the future, is always to use the subjunctive mood, whenever there is any degree of doubt or uncertainty implied, or expressed, if you can; in other words, to consider the word if, unless, although, &amp;c. as a sign of the subjunctive mood; in which case, you will not be troubled, once a year, with an exception. Another pretty trick of your classical people, is that of leaving out the relatives, as they would poison, from all their preparations. Blair is at the head of them, who prefer writing nonsense, to writing which, that, whom and who. Not many years ago, there was a foppery, somewhat like it, very prevalent in the world of shopkeepers, play-wrights, merchants, and manufacturers, whose English is quite another language from the English of other people. They left out the pronoun I; and fancied that they could not be egotistical then, by any possibility They would write, for example. “Dr. Sir—Received yours of 10th ult. Happy to apprise you. &amp;c.” We laugh at that; but is it, one tittle, more impertinent and foolish, than Dr. Blair's practice of leaving out the relative? He would say, “I am happy to inform you I am well;” or, “Sir—the man I called on,” &amp;c. What would one say, of a Frenchman—a scholar, and a critick, who should write, “On m'a dit vous etes” &amp;c. instead of “On m'a dit que vous etes.” Yet, the law is the same, in all languages; and, if we would feel the ridicule properly, we should look to some language, that has never been so corrapted, as our own. vol. ii. F You desire to learn something of the state of your favourite art, here. I do not pretend, as you know, Stafford, to understand the language of connoisseurs in the matter; but, what I know, in the most intelligible language that I am master of, is heartily at your service. In the first place, you cannot be ignorant that Mr. West; or, as you chose to call him, Sir Benjamin West, your president, is an American. Observe, I am not boasting of this—and, least of all, to you. But, I mention it, as a point, from which to start, in the enumeration of American painters. A genuine Englishman, if you mention the fact, that Mr. West is an American born, will “come down upon you,” as he says, with—“Ah, but he was educated in England,” Ergo; he is an Englishman. Just so, it was with Alexander Hamilton. We, Americans, boasted of him, because he was nursed and bred among us. But then, you cried out. “Ah! but he was born in England!” So, that if he be but born, though he never lived with you; or, if he were born here, and has been with you for a visit, though he never dwelt among you, you have always the modesty to claim him for an Englishman. Nay, have you not claimed all our discoveries; all our great men, as fast as they became conspicuous; and, when you could not discover, that they had been in England, or ever visited England, did you not fly to the ridiculous expedient of accounting for their greatness, by the operation of British laws? Thus, I remember, that one of your reviews, remarkable for its arrogant tone, and corrupt, barbarous English, not long since, declared that Washington was the growth of America, when she was a part of the British empire; and, that since her dismemberment, she had produced no men of such stature! inferring, of course, that a republican government, was unfavourable to moral greatness. Had they ever heard of Greece, and Rome? You often boast of your superiority. I have smiled, to hear you---even you, Stafford, whom I have heard, sometimes forgetting the character of a well-bred Englishman, and charging us with degeneracy. It is common to ask, where are our Shakspeares---Miltons---Bacons---Lockes ---Newtons? Men of England! Where is your exclusive property in the reputation of these men? We have as free and incontestable a title to it, as you. They are not your contemporaries. They are not of this generation. Where then, is your property in their fame? They stood among your fathers. They were countrymen of your ancestors. To this, we answer—They stood among our fathers, too. They were the countrymen of our ancestors, too. All the great men of Britain, who lived before our Declaration of Independence, left, as a legacy to the whole British empire, their crowns and sceptres; the regalia of immortality. Till then, we were a part of that empire; and our title, like yours, hath come to us, in the course of descent and distribution. It is a title of inheritance, only. But, to the fame of men that have lived in Britain since our revolution; to that, we abandon all claim; we ask, only for our own. Array your strong men together. We will array ours.---And see who overtops, or outnumbers the other. Yet, who shall be impartial? Not an American. No; nor a Britain? No.---Let us appeal then, to some other people. Let us look among them that are able and willing to be just. There is the National Institute of France. How many Britons do you find there? Five. How many Americans? Seven. Yet, you are twice as numerous a people. Is not this a fact that speaks loudly? But, I forhear; I allow much for national prejudice--- much, for republican partialities; but, will these account for such a difference, where these members are all honorary members; elected, too, the majority of them, under a regal government; and some, in a time of actual war, between France and America. Remember our population, and encouragement. What are they, in comparison with yours? You have heard of Copely. He was a strong, homely painter; but some of his portraits have great merit.--- There is Stuart, too; he has been among you---and you have seen his Washington. I have seen copies of it in Bengal, done in China. You have seen many. All are like each other; but none are likenesses of Washington. There is too much sublimity in the face. Stuart's Washington, I have heard my father say, who knew him well, was less what Washington was, than what he ought to have been. The painter has infused into it, an amplitude and grandeur, that were never the attributes of Washington's face. It is true, that there was a settled majesty;—an oppressive and great steadiness in the countenance of Washington, that awed and confounded men. His passions were tremendous, even in their repose; and it was impossible to become familiar with him, even at his own fire-side. The men that knew him best, and had been much with him, at times, when all mankind are brought into a kind of fellowship; in the field of battle, and at the dinner table; in the senate chamber, and at places of publick entertainment; always went around him reverentially, and regarded him, afar off, without approaching; as men might, a sleeping giant, whom it were impossible to contemplate with composure. Stuart says, and there is no fact more certain, that he was a man of terrible passions; the sockets of his eyes; the breadth of his nose and nostrils; the deep broad expression of strength and solemnity upon his forehead, were all a proof of this. So, Stuart painted him; and, though a better likeness of him were shown to us, we should reject it; for, the only idea that we now have of George Washington, is associated with Stuart's Washington. Yet, why should we complain? It matters not how a picture is painted, so that the copies are multiplied and received (if they resemble each other,) as likenesses. There is a Mr. Charles W. Peale, of Philadelphia, who wrought at Washington's face, at the same time with one or two of his own sons, and somebody else: all occupied themselves with different views, and different features—and, out of this, has been compounded a picture, no more like Stuart's Washington, I confess, than “I, like Hercules.” And yet, I am well assured, that it is a better likeness; and, indeed, the only faithful likeness of the man, in the world. Judge Washington, himself, I am told, has said this. How strange it is!—Thus we get accustomed to a certain image, no matter how it is created, by what illusion, or under what circumstances; and we adhere to it, like a lover to his mistress. If George Washington should appear on earth, just as he sat to Stuart, I am sure that he would be treated as an impostor, when compared with Stuart's likeness of him, unless he produced his credentials. At Mount Vernon, there is a picture of him, just after his marriage with Mrs. Custis[4] [4] The greatest curiosity there, except the key of the Bastile, presented by La Fayette. . I have studied it with attention. It is that of an ordinary man. There is not a single feature, or expression of greatness in it. Yet it is said to have been a remarkable likeness. I have often thought of the probable reception which that picture would meet with, if exhibited, now, as the portrait of Washington. It would be laughed at. I say— of what importance is it, whether Stuart's portrait of him be a likeness or not, so that all the portraits of him, are by Stuart, or copies of Stuart. It matters not, for example, how a word may be pronounced, so that all agree to pronounce it the same way. So too, say the lawyers, it often matters not what the law is, so that there is a law. And how know we that the pictures of Napoleon, which we have seen, are likeness of him? He never sat but once; and then, only for a few minutes to Gérard; and, during the whole time, kept walking about the room, with a cup of coffee in his hand. The artist lost his temper, as well he might, and painted the sketch only from memory. Yet, if they are alike, we are satisfied.--- Thus too, we get a strange notion of nature, from certain standards. A man goes to the theatre for the first time. He sees the first actor of the age. All his conceptions of nature are outraged. The passions are all caricatured; the sentiment exaggerated. Again, he visits a theatre—he sees some other actor. He no longer thinks of nature—he only thinks of the stage.— Instead of comparing this man's performance with the conceptions of his own mind, he compares it now with the acting that he had seen before. In time, he thus acquires a theatrical nature—a nature totally unlike and vol. ii. F 2 distinct from the naked and great nature of humanity. To this standard—that of his favourite actor, he applies all other acting. The test is insupportable. It is ridiculous. It is that spirit, which makes men always believe that the first way, in which they have heard a story, is the true one:—that their way is right; and all the rest of the worlds' wrong. Thus you have heard the same song sung to a dozen different tunes, and as many different words; and the same story located[5] [5] No such verb as—to locate.—Ed. in a dozen places, by as many people, each of whom verily believed that it happened where, and when, and how, exactly as he had heard it. Thus, a man inexperienced in the art of painting, is shown a landscape. He examines it. There is not a spot of bright green in the whole picture. He retreats—he recognizes some familiar prospect. Yet— it is not nature. But who is the master? Claude Loraine—Ah—“Well, really it is very natural!” and, ever after, instead of comparing pictures of the green earth, with the green earth itself, he compares them with the green earth of Loraine. Merciful powers---whither have I rambled. I began with the head of Washington —and I have followed I know not whom, round the whole world. I meant to give you a history of our paintings—and, to-morrow, if I have leisure, I will attempt it; but at present, as I am upon the character of George Washington, I will try to set you right on some of your opinions. Your theory has always been, that our faults are in proportion to our virtues. And you have regarded him as an exception—an anamoly in nature. You were mis-informed, Stafford. George Washington had his faults; and they were terrible. Nay—did he never blunder; and grievously too, in his warfare?—Look at the escape of Long Island. It was a desperate and unmilitary affair. He exposed his whole army to destruction, in case of defeat. But these are not the faults, of which I speak. They are of a deeper nature—they are constitutional. His temper was the whirlwind in its wrath. Let me give you some examples. At Kipp's Bay, immediately after the battle on Brookline heights, on Long Island—he lost all command of himself. His men behaved like cowards; and Washington flung the reins loose upon his horse's neck,—and struck at his men with his sword; and snapped his pistols at them;—nay, would infallibly have been taken prisoner, had not his family officers seized his horse's head, by force, and turned him back. Again—while the enemy were storming Fort Washington, he, with his principal officers, embarked in an open boat, from fort Lee, on the opposite shore of the North river; and they were all in a fair way of being captured, every man of them, when he came to his senses—and returned. Numerous examples are given of his violence; but they are mere personal affairs:—yet his conduct at the battle of Monmouth—his treatment of Hamilton—his rashness at Princeton—all this, show that George Washington had his infirmities, in the same measure as his virtues. And thanks be to God, that he had! Now we have an example to encourage us. Were he perfect, we should be repelled, intimidated and discouraged. You will be astonished, Stafford, to hear that his character is not understood by his own countrymen; but it is not. They have so long listened to hyperbolical eulogy, intemperate, and unmeaning praise, that he has lost to their eyes, the chief attributes of humanity—and become a God. For shame—Gods are manufactured by the feeble of mind, who, having no discrimination, no power of analysis; find it easier to take all their clay from one bank, than to compound it judiciously, of many, when they would exhibit the workmanship of their hands. Good night. To-morrow, in the same rambling way, I shall probably, undertake an account of our paintings—and painters. If I do it not, to-morrow, I hardly know when I shall be able to do it—for that will be a leisure and anxious day to me; as I am waiting the crisis of a tremendous disorder.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Tuesday Morning, half past eight.— I have just breakfasted; and the day is my own. Not to be interrupted, I have darkened my windows, and denied myself to all the world, but you, Stafford—for, with you, I am happy. Among our present artists, conspicuous for portrait painting, are Stuart; Peale, (Rembrandt,) Sully: Jarvis, and Wood, (remarkable for his small portraits in water colour.) Their styles are all different, but well characterised; and I will try to give you some notion of each. The manner of Mr. Stuart is careless, bold and confident. He developes character like a magician. He uses little or no material; is authority, in whatever he does; disdains to palliate, or soothe; and nothing can tempt him to paint a feeble face. The consequence is, that his women are very bad; and that his likenesses of men, are, in general, very striking, and very dignified. He delights in broad and heavy transparent shadowing; is never brilliant or showy; and there is no such thing as romance, or enthusiasm, in his pictures: but great soberness of mind, strength, and muscle. That of Mr. Peale is peculiar. He seems never weary of labour. His pictures are perfectly finished; and, when he has a good subject, you may always look for a very strong, beautiful, well-told portrait. His drapery is, generally, capital; but too laboured;—his flesh, faithful; and the expression, usually, very true. But, he is too jealous and thoughtful of his reputation; and, in one word, too honest a man to hazard much:—and the consequence is, that his portraits never startle us. There are no brilliant passages in them. They are rather profound than amazing. He never lets one go out of his hand, but as a piece of workmanship, which will always be worth the money that he has been paid for it. This has its disadvantage; for, were he to dash off his pictures, with the vigour that is natural to him, the effect would often be greater. Of any given number of portraits, executed in this way, it is true, that there would be more bad ones than there are now;—but then, there would be a few, a very few, better than he ever produces now. A beautiful picture, may be finished, no matter how well;—but a great portrait, particularly of a man, and a great man, is apt to lose its strength in finishing. But then, this is to be considered; the first is always valuable, as a manifestation of the art—the latter valuable only for a season, and with those who know the likeness. Of late, however, I have seen some bolder movements in this artist;—a stronger, heartier, and less anxious expression of power. Mr. Peale is not remarkable for taste or spirit; but for composure, and beauty, and dignity. The next, of whom I am to give you some information, is Mr. Sully. But, you are not to understand that there is any design in the order, in which I have placed their names. Each is superiour to all the others in some particular, and inferiour in some other. Mr. Sully, who, I am sorry to say, is an Englishman, by birth, and seven years of education, infuses his own character into all his portraits. He is one of the most indefatigable men in the world—an enthusiast in his art. He throws, like a poet, or a dramatist, or an actor, somewhat of himself into all the workmanship of his hands. His women, therefore, are full of fire, and instinct with spirit, where it is possible for him to find any justification for it. Their eyes, are the eyes of poetry, deep and melancholy, or patient and timid; but always, whatever be their expression, looking as if copied at the critical moment of their extremest beauty. Mr. Sully, too, is especially happy in his arrangement. His pictures are never velvetty; no strange lights, or shadows—but beautiful, and tranquil; or romantick, and spirited. His characteristicks are elegance and taste. He is not so remarkable for strength, or fidelity, or workmanship;—but, in all of his drapery, there is a surpassing gracefulness, and a careless unstudied richness. His hair is wonderfully fine. It is always shining and luxuriant. I should prefer Mr. Sully, I think, to any other artist that I have known, if I wanted the portrait of a youthful passionate, enthusiast, male or female;—but, if I wanted the likeness of a sober-minded man or woman, I would go to Mr. Peale;—and to Stuart, for whatever was awful, and distinct, and real. But Stuart has no poetry—Mr. Peale very little—and Mr. Sully, the poetry only of romance, in his pictures. With the latter all is picturesque, fanciful and wild—when he can have his own way—with well-bred people. With the second, all is sedateness, tranquillity, and goodness;—with the former, there is, always, a bold, careless spirit, which, you can see has wrought, knowing that, whatever it produced, would be regarded as a prodigy. But, by the way, your Sir Thomas Lawrence, whom Mr. Sully greatly resembles—but only in the free, fine, bold manner of Sir Thomas, and not in his late prettinesses and fopperies—is the greatest coxcomb, notwithstanding his high talent, that I know, among painters. I have seen a noble picture of his, uniting, in itself, all three of the manners, that every painter has during his practice. Some parts were hard and cold, like a cautious workman, finished by a painful and incessant comparison, at every touch, with the original —after the first manner of all painters, when they begin;—other parts were boldly dashed out, like the work of a man, who looks at his object, and then goes into another room—or waits till another day—sets up the canvass—catches up the paint—and throws it about, bravely, and at arm's length —boldly—fearlessly;—the second manner of such men as Stuart and Lawrence:—and other parts—the rest of that same portrait, I have found laboriously finished with a camel's hair pencil. What do you think of that, for the third manner of such a man as Sir Thomas Lawrence? Why is this? Poets fall into the same errour. They lose their fire and boldness; and become timid, cautious, and exact, as their blood grows old. Is it that they are afraid to lose the reputation which they got, by caring much less about it? Men get a name, by working for bread—not for a name—and they lose their name, the moment that they think of nothing but a name. Keep them poor—comparatively unknown—and they are fearless, desperate—having little to lose. After a while, they have every thing to lose—little to gain: and they go back to their earlier experiments, and renew them, in their old age; forgetful, generally, of the disadvantages which had attended them, and which had been the cause of their abandoning them, in their youth. Do you know the cause of his melancholy? I have heard a sad story about it—enough to make the heart of any man bleed, inwardly, all his life long—careless of fame, and every thing else. He loved one of two sisters—both superiour women. He was about to marry one, when he met the other—loved her—struggled, and struggled—but to no purpose—and then dealt, like a man, with the first. She bore it proudly— neither trembled nor bent—but died of a broken heart—extorting a promise, first, from her sister, upon her death-bed, never to marry the wretched man. The surviving sister kept her promise—and died also. Heaven! what a fate for genius! Even our Alston, too—his wife left him, in a strange land, just when the skies were opening about him. Mr. Jarvis—One of the greatest humourists of the age; and, did I want the picture of a humourist—anything happy, droll, and impossible for any other man to hit— I would go to Jarvis. There is an air of jovial oddity, or great strength, in all of his favourite pictures. He works hard, and faithfully; but would not have it known. Full of eccentricity and humour, he is the delight and rallying point.—the nucleus, about which, all that is eccentrick and humorous, within the sphere of his attraction, delights to assemble. His manner is rich, diversified, and daring;—that is, when he has a subject that will bear him out—but a tame face, becomes the tamest thing in the world, under the pencilling of Jarvis. One would think, that he was fashioned for taking portraits, only of such men as he knew, heart and soul; and loved as heartily. He is one of the boldest, and most original painters of the age; and is remarkable for the strong individuality of his favourite heads---bold, natural composition, manner, and attitude. Yet, as pictures, there is too little merit in the work of Mr. Jarvis; and, when the originals have passed away, and the memory of them, too, the greater part of his portraits will never be valued as pictures, and still less as paintings. If they be preserved at all, it will be because they were painted by Jarvis; and because they were, in other days, genuine portraits—not because of their merit; for that merit is mortal, and co-existent only with the originals. But that merit, in his pictures, I confess, to of be the highest order. Mr. Jarvis has painted some pictures, however; and one, of himself, which will always be valuable; but there are very few. He is lately doing miniatures, altogether in his own way, off hand, and full of effect. Mr. Wood—is the last of whom I shall now speak; though there are some others, strongly entitled to your notice—as Mr. Neagel, just coming out, very much in the manner of Stuart, though undetermined—(very fine talent,)—and Mr. Morse—but of him, more anon. Mr. Wood paints in water-colours. He was once, and continues, perhaps, to this hour, to be celebrated for his miniatures; but there was a time, when he painted nothing but miniatures. He was then associated with Mr. Jarvis. But a change in affairs, led him to adopt a new style of work, which he could afford at less price. It is the last thing that an artist will, or ought, to consent to —a reduction of price. He prefers giving some other manner, though it be more troublesome and laborious, for a less price. That prevents the disagreeable inference always made from a falling price—that the fashion of the ware is falling off. His first attempts were tolerable—barely tolerable. He laboured diligently; but the end of all his labour, was a hard, polished, flat, earthern picture, strangely like the original, nevertheless. But the spirit of the man waxed impatient. He struck into a bolder path—and the result is, at this moment, that he is unrivalled. His pictures are fuller of vivacity and character, than any that I have ever seen, of the same size. Now and then, it is true, I have seen some admirable oil likenesses, on the same scale, that were, to the full, as perfect; but they were not so full of spirit and ease. Mr. Wood I would never trouble with the face of a woman, particularly, if she were young and beautiful; or, if there were deep feeling in her eyes, unless I wanted her miniature. But, if she were a Catherine or Elizabeth; or, had any other high minded, domineering, and distinctly-marked countenance, I would trust him with it, in preference to anybody that I know. So too, with men. His Dandies and Delicates, are inexpressibly insipid—but his men, are men. There, my dear Stafford. Adieu for the present. I am actually weary of the subject; yet, do not flatter yourself, that I have relinquished it. No—I have much to tell you yet, of our historical department; for, I assure you, that, though we are Americans, we are getting to make quite a figure in it. Yours, forever, ED. MOLTON.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">REV. MR. ASHTON TO EDWARD MOLTON. My young friend, I have disturbed your proud spirit, and deeply wronged you. I have acted in a manner unworthy of my age, and of my situation, as a minister of peace; and I hasten to atone for it, I hope, in season to allay your impatience, and disarm your resentment. I received a letter from you, about a month since. I knew the hand-writing; and (I do not pretend to justify myself,) in a moment of indignation, I returned it to you, immediately, unopened. I am sorry for it. I beg your pardon. Can you forgive me?—will you? Perhaps, you have not received it. Indeed, I fervently wish that you may not;— at least, not until you have read this. But, if it be otherwise, let me beg of you to return it, to me. Not a week after I had forwarded that letter, my heart and my conscience arose and strove with me, but in vain, to bring me to repentance. I am not vindictive in my vol. ii. G temper, Mr. Molton; but I am old; and old men, though they have little reason for it, being so much nearer than others to the refutation of their errours, are apt to be obstinate. I was. I resisted the admonition of my heart. I strove mightily against it; but all would not do. I remembered your deportment; your temper; and what right had I to judge you, unheard? It is true, my young friend, that, to all appearances, you have been guilty of a tremendous crime. As it now appears, you have torn away a bride from the arms of her husband—fled with her; and, when pursued, left him weltering in his blood, upon the beach. I can imagine no excuse, no palliation for this; particularly, as I learn that you had an intrigue with the same woman, before her marriage; and yet, such is my compunction for my own unworthy, intemperate, and unchristian deportment toward you, that I have suspended my judgment, difficult as it was, to do so, until I can hear from you. If you be guilty—say so, and let me pronounce the sentence of the law, upon you. I may weep, young man; I may tremble; for you so resemble the son whom I have lost, that I should feel as if sitting in judgment upon my own child—yet, I would not avoid the appointment. I should lift up my voice, and denounce you. Yet—O would that you were innocent;—would that you could come to me; and kneel down with me, before our Father which is in heaven; and put your hands into mine—and say—I am innocent of this.—Of the blood of this man; of the honour of this woman, I am innocent. I wait to hear from you. Farewell. CHARLES ASHTON.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">REPLY. I have only time to tell you, my dear and excellent friend, that “I am innocent.” But the vessel is ready to sail; and I have neither time nor inclination to tell you the particulars. At some future day—no, I ought not to say that—for I never violate my word. I was about to tell you, that, at some future day, I should be able to communicate with you, face to face, all that led to this transaction. But, I cannot promise this, unless something should transpire to change my present views, radically and completely. The secret is now in mine own bosom—there it may die with me. I have nothing therefore, to offer you, but my simple word. With that, you must be satisfied. Believe it, if you can—“I am innocent of the husband's blood; and of the wife's honour.” I spilt the one, and rifled the other.—I do not deny it—but I did it, innocently. Do not doubt me. I have no interest in deceiving you; and no power to undeceive you, if you continue to wrong me. Perhaps—perhaps, I may be able, one day or other, to detail all the mournful and mysterious adventures of my life, to you, as I would to a father. There is one event, and one only, that can lead to this. If that happen, you will see me, when you least expect it—either in body or shadow. Dead or alive, if it be permitted to me, you shall be satisfied of my innocence, whenever that event arrives. If I be dead—and the power be upon me, I will stand at your elbow, where I last stood, and speak, if the miraculous organ of speech remain to me;—and, if not, I will look into your soul, my friend, with the aspect of unclouded, and regenerate innocence. This will be given you, by Mr. George Stafford. If you do not know him already, I beg that this may be a sufficient introduction to you. I shall enclose it to him, in a long letter, which I finished but yesterday, to go by this vessel. Farewell—I do forgive you—with all my heart and soul; and entreat you to burn or forget, which ever may be easiest, my letter, whenever it comes to hand. I could almost wish that the vessel had foundered! Truly yours, EDWARD MOLTON.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">HELEN MOLTON TO CLARA PETERS. Yes, my dear Miss Peters, you are rightly informed. I did say that, the ladies, or many of them, on your Eastern Shore of Maryland; and, in your beautiful city of Baltimore too, “were guilty of beastly practices.” You cannot be ignorant of what I alluded to; for, when I met you at Baltimore, you were in a fair way to follow their example. Must I speak plainly? Do you forget what they meant, by inviting you, frequently, to go into the garden, or your room, and take a rub? Merciful heaven, how often have I seen them, with all their heads together in a bye place, before I knew what was meant by taking a rub; and, when I found that it was a cant phrase, to express, what my stomach turns at, while I write—the division of snuff—to be taken by handfulls—you have no idea how pained and humbled I felt. What! women!— young and beautiful, getting into a corner, to eat snuff.— The thing would be incredible, were it not known to be very common. I know a remedy. Let their names be published. The women that I speak of, are accustomed to chewing snuff, in such quantities, and so continually, as to intoxicate them, and shatter their constitution. Clara Peters—have you forgotten Mrs. C—, and the two Misses P—? They consumed pounds and pounds of snuff, till the hands of the former, shook like those of a confirmed drunkard; and her head trembled, as if she had the palsy; and the complexion of the two latter, the younger of whom was once a blooming, sprightly girl, became swarthy, sallow, and cadaverous. When I spoke to them, and to you, my dear, for your folly in attempting the experiment, what was their apology? They only used snuff they said, to clean their teeth.—Faugh!—what a filthy practice. But that was not true. They always had a mouthful of it. They ate it, by spoonfuls; and loved it, as they say in Maryland, mighty bad; and I told them nothing more than was true—when I said, that it was beastly—that it was the worst and most unpardonable of all intemperance;—that it was eaten only to produce inebriety, like opium, brandy, or tobacco, except that, no tobacco-chewer, beastly as he may be, consumes a quantity like them. Yes—It was to that, that I alluded. The practice is beastly. HELEN.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SARAH TO JULIET. Tell me, my dear, dear Juliet, what has become of you? John says that you are really married; married to Mr. Grenville. I cannot believe it; yet, strange as it is, my poor heart begins to yield to the apprehension. Was it then, your hand writing, that disturbed me so? Was it you, Juliet, you, whom I have so loved, that told me, with a trembling hand, to believe nothing, that I did not hear from yourself? I have obeyed you. I am told, that you ran away. I do not believe it. I am told, that you have been turned out of doors. I do not believe it. I am told, that you are married to Mr. Grenville. I never will believe that, until I have it in “black and white, under your own hand.” I have nothing more to say. I have few comforts left for me. I can ill spare the smallest of them now;—but the bitterest, the most insupportable of bereavements to me, Juliet, would be the loss of my love, and respect for you.—I cannot go on—the tears gush out of my eyes, at every throb of my heart; and wert thou near me, my own dear, dear Juliet, I should be sobbing, like a child, in thy bosom. Am I unkind, Juliet?—Pity me, if I am—it is not natural to me. There is no unkindness at my heart. I never, never loved thee so tenderly; so, as if there were nothing else on earth dear to me, as at this moment. Then, why should I doubt thee? I do not,-I will not--I will believe nothing, suspect nothing, until I hear it from thine own sweet lips, (for writing may deceive me,) that thou art no longer worthy of my veneration—. No, I will be more cheerful—I will. vol. ii. G 2 Is it not wonderful, dear Juliet?—yes, I will change the theme. I will forget that I have been weeping for thee—it is the only way—. Is it not strange, Juliet, that I have heard nothing, of late, from the deaf-and-dumb man?—Nay, what a ridiculous question!—but, I am sadly anxious to write about something, with an air of pleasantry. I often think of him; and, in my dreariness, I have almost wished that he might stand before me. Laugh with me, Juliet!—Nay, laugh at me, for I really deserve it. Do you know, that, just at that moment, where I left off, I happened to lift my eyes—and, if ever I was possessed, it was at that instant, I declare —I never was so frightened in my life—I saw the very eyes of the deaf-and-dumb man rivetted upon me!—as I thought. A cry escaped me, I believe; but, the good creature appeared more terrified than I; and, though I confess, that his first attempts at conversation were laughable enough, yet, in a few moments, he was quite intelligible. I came to my senses, and who do you think it was?—nobody, in the world, but my poor drawing-master. “Pray,” said I, “Mr. Randolph,” (with some embarrassment, I confess; for I had been inconceivably terrified, and I was anxious to learn if he had heard me say any thing aloud; for sometimes, you know, I have been guilty of talking—not to myself, exactly, but loud enough for the neighbours to hear me, when I was all alone;) “how long have you been here?” He smiled. “Only a moment, I assure you.” A pause— “I see that you are distressed. Let me re-assure you. I knocked at the outer door; but, as it stood ajar; and nobody came to me; and I saw you occupied, as I thought, with your painting, I ventured to come into the room. It was not, till I had bowed twice or thrice; and was on the point of announcing myself with some emphasis, that you designed to lift up your eyes. And when you did, —what a reception! I know not whether you were frightened or not; but I am pretty sure that I was. My hair will never lie close again, while I live. Nay, it is cruel in you to laugh; does'nt this chattering of my teeth convince you, that, whatever it may have been to you, it was no laughing matter with me.” His countenance changed—his hand fell upon my shoulder.—I was indignant. I had half a mind to strike it off—but, before he had finished a sentence, I had entirely forgotten that it was there; and, it was not till he had left my room, that I remembered it, as a freedom that I will never permit again. Yet, he, I am sure, was unconscious of it. It was done with the most natural, frank, plausible manner in the world—as if in excess of earnestness; just as if he had forgotten himself, in his anxiety to re-assure me. “Miss Ramsay,” said he “I am come on a serious errand. Yet, before I trouble you with it, allow me to assure you, that you uttered not a loud word; that, I overheard nothing.” I started.—Could the creature read my thought? or had he read my letter?.—Read my letter!—ridiculous indeed; that part of it, was not then written. He continued.—“And that I saw nothing, heard nothing, which you have any reason to lament. I see, by your countenance, that you are apprehensive of this. Believe me, I tell you nothing but the truth; and, had I, by any misfortune, overheard anything, or overlooked anything, that was not meant for my ears or eyes, I should have been as much distressed at it, as yourself.” It was said in a manner, so convincing, that I could not doubt it. I forgave him, therefore; and then, I—forgave myself. But, what think you, was his errand? Let me tell you, in his own words. “You have sent for me, to teach you drawing. I have obeyed the summons. You would learn painting. I am unable to teach you that. You appear surprised. It is natural. I pass for a drawing-master. I have even taken likenesses. Nay, I have taught others, who were superior to you; yet. I cannot teach you. This would seem to be a paradox. But, the truth is—I am an impostor.” My blood thrilled, Juliet;—and I declare to you, that I began to fancy that there were the same eyes—again, that I had seen so near my face, in Boston;—when I was taken up, as I thought, by the deaf-and-dumb man, from under the very wheels of the carriage, and hoofs of the horses---what a delightful adventure it would have been! ---what a novel might have been made of it! But ah--- the incorrigible reality. It would come---and dash! away went the cup of mystery and enchantment. He continued,—“I am an impostor. I have been teaching an art, of which I am ignorant. But then, I am not so ignorant as the people here. When I began, I knew nothing of it. I never had any instruction; but I have taught myself, by blundering, and by teaching others. My manner has been assured, composed- and I have a consummate impudence. The game, that I have played, has been a fair one; but it cannot continue. I have found one woman, whom I can respect. For that reason, I tell you the truth. I foresee the consequence. You will dismiss me---and my ruin will follow, for, here, I have no other means of livelihood. Yet---I cannot consent to impose upon you:—why, I know not, for I could do it, if I would; and I have imposed upon wiser and more experienced people than Miss Ramsay.” I was amazed; and yet, the frankness of the creature pleased me. “No, Mr. Randolph, I will retain you yet; and do what I can, to promote your school; I know nothing of your landscapes, or colouring, or likenesses; but I am pleased with your drawing, and can improve by it.” “You are mistaken,” said he: “your style is better than mine. You smile---I am gratified that you take the disclosure so pleasantly. Let us continue our acquaintance. I shall be here for a few weeks longer; and will, if you will permit me, continue to visit you, at the same hour ---as your drawing master; but, on this condition alone, that I receive no pay. You look alarmed---I mean, no pay in money;---but, I am willing to be paid, by your instruction for mine. I love your colouring. It is bold and beautiful. I have a faculty of imitation, and can profitby it, I am sure.” I consented. “But pray,” said I, for I could not help laughing at the oddity of the conceit---“how have you managed to get the reputation that you have, as a drawing master?” He smiled---and went to confession, forthwith; and his frankness became so irresistibly droll and unxpected, that, though I am not much addicted to laughing aloud, and was never less in a laughing humour, yet it made me laugh so often, and so loudly, that I have had a pain in my side ever since; and he has been gone a full hour.--- and the best of it was, that the man looked all the while, as if he had no concern at all in the matter. “If you will have the patience to hear me for a few minutes,” said he, “I will let you into the whole mystery. But first, let me remark, so that you may not be offended at my bluntness—that I treat women, no matter who they are, just as I do men; or, with very little more forbearance or consideration, when I respect them. I treat them as companions, friends, people of understanding, or fools; and contradict them, correct them, or laugh at them, whenever they deserve it—not merely to make them ridiculous, or to hurt their feelings; but, wherever it may be a benefit to them. I will not offend you, if I can help it—but I would have you prepared for a manner that is new to you among men. Most men treat women like spoilt children, who must not be contradicted, or opposed, or thwarted—whose bad temper must always be humoured—I do not. I respect women, but it is in my own way. I would make them wiser and better; and, therefore, I say that to them, and before their face, which I never say, or permit another to say behind their backs. Profligates—men that think most irreverently of women, cannot do this---do not. So, you see---I am no profligate. Now, to my story. When I was a boy, I was fond of pictures. I began to imitate them; and, as all children do, I became passionately enamoured of vivid colouring. I had no models; or, what was worse than none, very bad ones; but, such as I had, I imitated, and surpassed. In that way, by stealing a hint, here and there, from water-coloured daubing; samplers and embroidery; fruit and birds, &amp;c.—I soon managed to make, what I thought, extremely pretty roses and rose buds. At this time, all that I had learnt, was, to imitate some wretched stuff, in the drawing-book of a girl, that went to the same school with my sister. But my roses soon grew in repute; and I had my hands full of solicitation from all my uncles and aunts, and cousins--- yet, devil of a rose would I part with---I beg your pardon for swearing. One of my expedients, to give effect to these flowers, was, to varnish them with gum-arabick, till they would crack and peal off, like the glazing of crockery, in cold weather; or like the Japan tinning of bad ware, by a hot fire.” “I had a school master, who was a prodigy of genius in our estimation--and his own. He had painted many surprising matters; but nothing that tickled my fancy like a young chicken cock, upon a gray rock, in full feather,---with a gray squirrel upon a gray tree. And one day, for some freak of mine, he was unlucky enough to think of locking me up, alone, in the school room.---I attacked his treasury, directly---pillaged it; ransacked the desk; and bore off the cock and squirrel in triumph. As soon as I had arrived at my room, I sat down to copy it. And so surpassingly ignorant was I then, of the manner, in which the gray, stone colour was produced, that, instead of looking for Indian ink, the properties of which, I knew nothing of, I compounded a strange wash of the black and white, which were in my sister's paint box. Yet, with these, I persevered, until I had made so perfect a copy, that, I am sure, my master, himself, could hardly have told which was his own. That was the height of my ambition.” “Some time after, I was put apprentice to a retail-shopkeeper; but my passion, for drawing and painting, still remained; and I grew fond of copying whatever came in my way. The consequence was, that I learnt all the faults of each. Yet, I learnt to draw. At length, I undertook faces—profiles, simply, because an old man that boarded with me, used to amuse himself, while he was starving, in the same way. It is easy to make a profile, an outline I mean; but the difficulty is in filling it up—so that some one, among a multitude, may guess at the original. This done, for once; and people are very quick at such discoveries, where there is'nt anything to pay—and confoundedly backward, as I have found, to my mortification, where there is—the reputation of the artist is established forever.” “Well—it happened, in the course of time, that I learnt to draw with some precision and vigour; but my principles were wrong; and I was unable to fill up the outline, from a total ignorance of light and shadow.” “But—I happened, also, to discover that Indian ink was not to be put upon the paper, black as ten thousand devils ---your pardon, Miss---I must break myself of this vile habit—and then washed light. This had been my practice. And, Columbus, when the sailor upon the top, cried out land!—and Archimides, when he sang out Eureka!— Eureka!—did not feel more astonishment and delight than I, when I learnt that Indian ink was to be put upon the paper, diluted lightly at first; and to be deepened afterward by repetition. It was an era in my life.” “About this time—you will not forget, that I was a clerk to the mystery of selling tape by the yard—a man came to my native town to teach writing, in twelve lessons. He was a precious scoundrel—an ignorant and presumptuous fellow, without education or principle;— but he did write a wonderfully beautiful hand, and made some pretensions to drawing—nay, almost overpowered us, I remember, once, with the picture of two red cheeked angels, in a whirlwind of fire and smoke, with blue wings, and a great gold pen in their jaws.” “With this man, I enlisted—to see the world; having the most magnificent designs and adventures in view. The first thing, that he did, was to pack me off to Brunswick College, where I found a parcel of fools, from six years old and upward, to pay me for teaching them to write “in twelve lessons, of two hours each.” Perhaps you would like to understand the mystery of that. It lay simply here—in the course of these twelve lessons, a person was made to write more lines and pages, than he usually did in a whole year; and this too, under the eye of the master, with the best of pens, the best of ink, and his paper so ruled, that, for his life, he could not go wrong.” “Well, I continued my career, till I found it necessary to claim a part of my salary; for, I had managed so as to consume all the receipts; cheating, too, with all possible adroitness; and economizing, till it approached to meanness.” “My next movement was for New York. But I stopped at Portsmouth, where the people would not bite— though one would have thought that they might, in the mere spirit of retaliation; they having been bitten confoundedly, to my certain knowledge, more than once, in one way, and another, the same generation. Well— in Portsmouth, I, finally, had wisdom enough to abandon the itinerant, and low life of a writing master, to become a—shopkeeper—again. I took up with the partner of a man, with whom I had lived, when first tempted away from the counter. He was a petulant, haughty, ignorant, money-making man; but, with a good head— and a warm heart, I think at the bottom;—and, with him I continued, until I had spoilt the hand writing of his two daughters gratis, in teaching them my twelve-lesson scheme—I then quarrelled with him--and parted, with just cash enough in my pocket to carry me home, and buy a halter.” “What was I to do?—I had a serious aversion to hanging—a constitutional one perhaps; partly, I dare say, in the mere spirit of contradiction; for most of my friends seemed to regard that, as the infallible termination of my adventures. So, rather than hang or starve, I took to drawing; and, finally, after offering to teach to the people of my native place, who never would be fools enough to pay me for it, the art of penmanship; and, deposited some egregious specimens of my folly in the hands of some, whose interest it was, to get me some scholars, but whose sense of common decency, proably prevented them from exhibiting my specimens;—I borrowed a few dollars of a relation, and started, to seek my fortune, in this part of the world. I determined never to return, till I was able to buy a dose of arsenick, at least, with my own money, honestly earned. I arrived in an open boat, at Bath—where I dined at a tavern, and ran away, without paying for my dinner—for old acquaintance sake— for the landlord knew me; and, truly, he deserved nothing better, for admitting me into his house, without the money in advance.” “From Bath, I went to Hallowell, and opened a writing school. But---I thought of drawing, and added that to it. The thing took tolerably; and I then came up the river. But let me tell you how I have managed to get the reputation that I have. If anybody know more of the art than I do, I am sure to pump all his knowledge out of him, and apply it to my own; amusing him all the while, as jugglers do, their prey, by talking about Titian, Reubens, Raphael, colouring, conception---Chiaro oscuro, &amp;c. &amp;c. as fast as I can—and that, you know, must be tolerably fast. This will, generally, take his breath away; and, people are always kind enough to conclude, that, whatever is inexplicable, in my style or language, is something superiour to their understanding. On some occasions, I confess, that I have been hard run; and that, I have not always been able to keep my countenance. You know how sore people are, when they cannot guess for whom a picture has been taken; and how delighted they are, when they happen to guess right. I took advantage of this.—I always painted profiles; and, if there were a big nose, or a wen, or a wart, or a long chin, that was enough for me—if not, I was fain to content myself with a cocked hat, or a pair of spectacles—the likeness of which, I could not miss; and all the world could see, at a glance. I contented myself then, with the outline, only; and that, I took care, to show to somebody that knew who had been sitting. This would always resemble the person, if he were devilish ugly—your pardon, Miss— and, having once got an opinion of this kind, the money was my own. I knew that no blundering of mine, could ever destroy a likeness, once acknowledged; and, there fore, I went on, working as fearlessly with my indian ink, as if I were blacking a pair of boots: and the expression was, generally worthy of the work. Nay, I have vol. ii. H laughed, time and again, till the tears came into my eyes, on looking at my own pictures, as they darkened and darkened, like negroes, drying before a slow fire, after the reiterated washes that I had given them.” “And once—I must tell you this—there was a captain of the United States' army, at Hallo well—a prodigiously ugly man—with a nose like a coffee-pot—no, bigger than that—like a pump-handle. I made a likeness of that feature—for, it was impossible to miss it—and I had half a mind, when I had finished the nose, to stop— for I knew that all the world would acknowledge it; but, at last, on second thought, I concluded to put a chin, and some other things, of the same sort, to it—for he might be unreasonable, you know—and I liked to give every one his money's worth;—and so, I put some other features to it, at my leisure—giving myself no trouble about their being his—the nose was enough for me—for I had constantly dreamt of it; nay, it had haunted me in the day-time, from the hour that I began its likeness—like the spectre of something that had been unfairly dealt with. Well, I finished the likeness—and such a likeness!—by Jupiter, there was'nt a dog in the house, that would'nt have yelled out, at the sight of it. He came to get it. I could hardly keep my mouth shut, though I bit my lip, till the blood came. He grew black in the face, while he looked at it—and the likeness grew, every moment, more striking. Had his rage continued till this time, the resemblance would have been perfect. He considered—knit his brows—and, I am sure, that that balancing in his mind, was, whether he should break my head, or burn his own;—and that he paid me for it, lest I should show it—which would have made him the laughing stock of the whole town;—and, I am equally sure, that he put it behind the back-log, while I was putting his money into my pocket.” “On another occasion, a beautiful woman—rather of a doubtful character, though, I am told—came to sit to me, in one of the coldest days of winter—the depth of January. I kept her, with her teeth chattering, till she was the colour of raw meat, that had been frozen and thawed, several times--in a thin muslin dress, for a whole day—and then packed her off, some dollars lighter, with a pretty picture, to be sure; or, rather, with the picture of a pretty woman, with a smutty, dismal face—but no more like her, than it was like my own mother. But I had seen something of women before—and I caught, instinctively, what I have since learnt, is the perfection of the trade. She wore a breast-pin; a collar of lace, richly embroidered; and an open-worked muslin frock. All these, I copied faithfully, with all their flourishes, flings, and furbelows. The effect was surprising—every body knew the likeness of the breast-pin and ruffle—and every body concluded, that, although he was unable to see the least likeness, I won't say of the woman herself, for to that I did not even pretend, but of humanity—yet, that the fault was in him, and not in me—for had'nt I proved, that I could paint the likeness of a breast-pin and ruffle?—and why, then, could I not paint the likeness of a woman?—her face?—and features?” There, my dear Juliet, I have written you a letter; the length of which, though it may weary you, I hope you will receive, as an atonement for the unkindness of its commencement. What think you of the man, Randolph? Is there not something truly original about him? You hear what he has said; but you ought to have seen him, heard him, while he described the captain. You would never have forgotten it—there was such an air of downright pleasant seriousness, energy and simplicity that— but no matter—farewell. S. R.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">JULIET TO SARAH. Congratulate me, Sarah, my sister—congratulate me; I have just risen from my knees; and my senses are yet reeling with the shock of a discovery, that had well nigh been fatal to me. Such a scheme of darkness! continued, too, for such a length of time; O, it is incredible that I never should have dreamt of it; never suspected it! But, let me tell you, as well as I can, of the whole affair, in order, as it happened. We were at breakfast, this morning. The servant brought me two letters; one from you, (which I shall answer, at the first leisure,) and one from Mr. John Omar. I opened his first, because I desired to read yours, when I was alone—I could'nt bear to read it, before the eyes, even of my husband—it is like meeting some one that is very dear to us—after a long, long time, in the presence of a stranger. His letter was very brief; it merely informed me that Molton had sent for him, in a great hurry, to see poor Jane, who was alarmingly ill. I was just breaking the seal of yours, desirous of getting a peep at it, before the table was cleared, when I heard a strange noise—and, on looking up, I beheld my husband, as pale as death—with several letters, lying before him— their seals broken, and one in his hand, open. Before I could articulate a cry, or arise from my chair, the paper dropped from his hand; and he sunk down, gradually upon the floor, on his knees; and bowed down his head, like one, upon whom the hand of God was laid heavily. His face was covered—but I saw his chest heave—his hair move—his forehead shiver—his lips tremble;— and the tears trickle through his fingers. “Almighty God!”—he murmured, at last, “I thank thee!” I was inconceivably frightened—I know not what I did, or what happened—but, when I awoke, my head was in his lap, and he was looking over me, with a look of such impassioned, such distracted tenderness, that, for the first time, Sarah, my heart gushed out, with unadulterated affection. From that moment, I was the happiest woman in the world;—but, judge of my consternation, my horrour and dismay, when he put the following letter, from Molton, into my hand. “Enclosed are the proofs, that I went in search of.— They are wet with blood;—but do not fear to read them. It is the blood of the guilty. Your heart is now satisfied; and the restraint which you imposed upon yourself, for a time, you now see, was salutary and wise. It was well for you, that you never told the tale to your wife. If you had, it would have killed her. No matter when the proofs of her innocence had come to you, if there were one moment, between the arraignment and the acquittal, she would have died, of a broken heart. Jane is at the point of death. I have dealt plainly with her; cruelly, perhaps; but there was no other way, and I feel no compunction, for my own conduct. The papers, that you will find in this, are the copies, and proofs of the whole conspiracy. You would do well, I think, to put the whole into the hands of your wife. She is capable of appreciating such confidence; and she will love you, if I know anything of her character, better than she ever has yet, when she knows the whole.” And what do you think was the nature of this conspiracy, Sarah? It was such, that—tears, hot tears and confusion, would not permit me to communicate to any human being but yourself; nor even to you, perhaps, if I did not so earnestly desire that you should know what a noble heart I have for a companion. The letters were a pretended correspondence, between Molton and myself, of a nature, so artfully managed, by mingling fact with falsehood, that they went through my heart, sometimes; and I trembled like a guilty woman, to see how capable my conduct has been, of the cruelest interpretation. It was a long time, before I could understand them, at all.—I read them over again. Still, they were unintelligible. I saw that they were managed to prove an intrigue—a shameful, dishonourable, criminal intrigue—between Molton and myself. But whom were they to deceive?—Not my husband, for they had promoted his views, with all their power. But the mystery was soon explained. The hand writing, I saw, was Jane's—but there were interlineations, and alterations, in a different hand—I hope that I am not accusing the innocent, but they did look to me, like the work of Miss Matilda. My husband then produced a packet of letters; and put them into my hands. I opened them. The first was directed to me, and was in the hand writing of Molton. I began to read; but, bewildered and frightened, I looked to Mr. Grenville, for explanation. He shook his head, and smiled; but the tears stood in his eyes yet. vol. ii. H 2 He handed me another—my hand shook with terrour; the writing was so like mine, that, it was some minutes, before I could assure myself that it was not—nor did I, to my own satisfaction, till I had read the letter. It was full of passionate, wild entreaty; and—but I cannot tell you what the meaning of it was—it made me tremble and weep, with indignation. My husband took my hand. “It was well managed,” said he—“Juliet—see here.” He then showed me the regular post mark, and my own seal, upon two of the letters. The truth now flashed upon me, all at once; I remembered that Jane and I were taught by the same writing master; and that, although she wrote a better hand than I; yet, that, at school, she was able to write exactly like me; for, on one occasion, I narrowly escaped punishment, for some of her scribbling. I remember too, that, having borrowed my seal once, she pretended that she had broken, and lost the cornelian; for, she returned me the setting, only. “But when, and where did you receive these vile things?” said I—“and how could Mr. Molton be base enough—?” “Hush, Juliet—we must not speak rashly of that man. You, surely, do not believe that (handing me one of the letters) to be his hand writing?—as well might I believe this to be yours. No—the same hand that counterfeited the one, counterfeited the other.” I was glad to hear this, I confess; for even now, I cannot bear to think meanly of Edward — Molton, I should say—Mr. Molton. “But when did you receive them? how? and from whom?” said I. He grasped both my hands in his; and, while he spoke, the voice appeared to issue from the deepest place of his heart. Never was I more affected in my life. “I received them,” said he, “from a person unknown, the very next morning after our marriage.” “Gracious heaven!” said I, “and this that was the cause of the change in your deportment, which so nearly deprived me of my senses?” “It was—I endeavoured to conduct as usual. I endeavoured to disbelieve the damnable slander—Nay, many times, many times, my beloved, was I upon the point of burning them, at once;—but then, a wish to discover the truth, prevented me. More than once too, I was on the point of calling you to me, and putting them into your hands. But then—if by any possibility, they were genuine, what madness that would be.—It would destroy you and your husband, dear Juliet—it—.” At length, I resolved to be silent; and it was only then, when my troubled spirit had become calm and submissive, that I observed how deeply you had been distressed. New doubts arose—they might have been a confirmation to one of a jealous nature—but I am not jealous; at least, not suspicious; jealous I am, of sharing thy heart, my wife, I confess, with any being but my Maker—Nay, I can hardly endure the thought of that, at times.—In short, Juliet, I determined to keep the whole a secret from you, until I had given you proof, by my manners and confidence, that I did not believe the slander.” I pressed his hand, Sarah—I could have knelt to him. What magnanimity! what generosity! “My husband!” said I—“till this hour, I have never known you? “But (a thought struck me just then) there is one thing upon which I have been silent so long, that, now, I dare not mention it. It was a trifle at first; and had I spoken of it, exactly as my heart prompted me to speak of it, all would have been over;—but by thinking of it, so long, and putting it off, so frequently, it has become —.” “What! Juliet—tell me at once—I tremble more at such an introduction, than at any disclosure. What do you allude to?” “To that letter,” said I, reaching him one, that I had carried, ever since our marriage, in my pocket book, determined, when I had the heart to speak lightly of it, to ask an explanation.—“I now ask what you had ever seen in my conduct to authorize you to —.—Nay I do not mean to be very serious now; but then I was hurt and mortified.” I stopped suddenly, for, with an air of perplexity that, on any other occasion would have been irresistibly ludicrous—he began rummaging his pocket-book, and produced a lock of hair.—“Is that yours?” said he. I took it—looked at it—and was fain to say, upon my word, “I believe that it is.—But where on earth did you meet with it? And why did you once hint, so strongly as you did—that something of the sort would be very dear to you, if you had this already. Is it mine?” “Is that your writing?” said he, reaching me the envelope. I examined it—it was my writing; I could not deny it.--But, judge of my confusion, when I read it—it was in these words:— “Yes—I will indulge you, if it be true that there would be any value in it, to your eyes; but, on this conditional one, a whimsical one, I confess, but, nevertheless, a condition, with which I cannot dispense—that you never allude to it, in any way hereafter. My troubles and mortifications are already too numerous for my patience; and I cannot submit to their augmentation. Adieu.— Heaven forever bless you.” Are you not terrified, Sarah?—That note was really written by me; but, how or when, I have not the least recollection, but I probably wrote it some time, at the solicitation of Jane, for I was in the common practice of doing so; and now, that I look at the initials, they appear to have been written by another—the I, in particular, is more like the I, that Jane writes her name with, than mine. Yes—I have no doubt of it—the occasion is forgotten; but that note, I am sure, was written by me, under her direction, while her hand was lame, from her fall—and that note, the cruel girl had the wickedness to send to Grenville, inclosing a lock of my hair, after I told her, that I had refused to understand him. Nor is this all. On coming to an entire explanation, it appears that several notes and keep-sakes in the possession of both of us, were furnished by Jane. What inconceivable management! I was mortified to the heart. But my excellent husband soon re-assured me; “All these matters, my dear wife,” said he, “must be forgotten; or remembered only as a piece of pleasantry. Hereafter, let our aim be to make each other happy—we will never remember how we happenened to be married—by whose agency, or by what means—but that we are married.” Congratulate me, Sarah;—is it not a miraculous escape? And would not an ordinary man have been disturbed, immeasurably, by such treachery. And could I ever have held up my head afterward; innocent or guilty, if my husband; the lord of my affections; the partner of my heart, had once suspected me!—O never—never. Farewell, JULIET. P. S. I quite forgot the drawing master.—I have read your letter, and laughed heartily enough, I assure you—but there is one thing, that I would caution you against—his cold-blooded impudence.—That manner of putting his hand upon yours--or, upon your shoulder, is treacherous. It is never done by accident;—or, if it be, it is no compliment, to a woman. It is better that it were done with design; for that implies a respect for her, and a consciousness that, to be at all familiar, one must approach cautiously. I do not like it for another reason— it reminds me somewhat, of a person whom I once knew. If his hand once touched you, you were gone!—irretrievably gone. You would have neither the strength nor the courage; nor often the inclination to displace it.--Beware of this man--awkward as he is--he must be dangerous, to have enthralled Sarah Ramsay, for a single moment, so that she suffered his hand to repose upon her shoulder. J. R. G.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">JOHN TO SARAH. She is gone, Sarah, gone, forever and ever! gone, in terrour and distraction, to a grave of blood. Never was there such a death-bed scene!---I will not attempt to desscribe the whole; I cannot, but I will try—with the feeble remains of my strength, to relate what happened after my arrival. The first person that I saw, was Molton---sitting by her bed side; immoveable; and, with a countenance of one death-struck, holding one hand upon her temples, and supporting his own forehead with the other. She had just life enough to move her lips, and to perceive whose hand it was that allayed, with its chilliness, the scorching fever of her temples. Her vivid eyes were lifted now and then, to his, with an expression of tenderness, passionate tenderness, so unlike aught that I had ever seen in them before, that I could scarcely believe her to be Jane. It was a comfort to her, to have him near her---that, I could see distinctly---though his face was the face of a Destroyer; of one, that nothing, no weeping, nor prayer, nor terrour, nor trial, may move,---unrelenting, stedfast and inexorable. I listened; but I could not hear him breathe. I approached; and, as he turned to me, he moved his hand--- and she caught it, as it passed her lips--and pressed it to them, again and again---with a low, sobbing, inarticulate sound of transport---“O, do not leave me, Molton; do not take it away!” But he gave me his hand, hot and moist, from the pressure of her mouth, nevertheless. It was like the touch of a serpent to me. I shuddered.--- Jane saw it, and a sickly smile went over her features; and then they grew, all at once, rigid, fixed,---motionless. “She is gone!”---said Molton---in a low whisper; and, as he spoke, her hand dropped from his---and her jaw fell. Ah, how suddenly!---it was just as if her spirit had sprung, without notice, from her tenement, dislocating and shattering every joint, in her wrath and determination; as something obscene and horrible, and hateful to it. I was about to be left alone, immediately, with Molton, and the body; but he arose, and put himself between one of the women, and the hall, just as she was shutting the door. “Come back, madam!” said he. “Nay, do not resist me,—I will be obeyed.” She shook in every joint; and, when he led her to the bed, the sweat started out upon her quivering lips; and her eyes looked as if she were about to be immolated on the spot. It was Matilda. The lights burnt with a pale, funereal, uncertain light. “Woman!” said he—turning down the clothes and revealing the body of Jane—“woman! that is your work.” I looked—and beheld the sheets sprinkled with drops of blood. There was a deep ruffle about the neck of Jane, which, from its singularity, I had before observed. He was about removing it, when Matilda arrested his hand with a loud shriek. “Man! monster! monster, forbear!”—she cried. And pushed away his hand—but, not till I had seen—O, Sarah! Sarah!—I cannot tell thee what. No, no—I cannot, —my blood thrills yet, at the thought of it. Jane had destroyed herself. I know not why, nor wherefore. I only know that, when I spoke of it to Molton, he shuddered, locked his hands —and his eyes rolled inward, as if to contemplate something that no other man would dare to look upon. Yet— he recovered, almost immediately. “I did not expect this,” said he. “But—there was a duty to perform, to the innocent and devout. I did it. That woman, whose body lies there, is now before her Maker, in judgment. Let us not speak unkindly of her. She had a noble spirit; and, under any other training than thine”—turning to Matilda, who was leaving the room—“thou bad woman—nay, thou shalt not leave me —thou and I will sit by the body together, till the turf be piled upon it—but for thee, it had been instinct with spirit; beautiful; and innocent as beautiful, at this moment! Tears!—nay, then,—go—go in peace. If thy heart be touched indeed, I have no more to do with thee. My commission has expired. Go in peace!” “I am glad that you have come, Mr. Omar, late as it is. But, for your sake, it would have been better that you had arrived a few hours earlier. You are a man of strong passions. To have seen that body, sir, convulsed and heaving, with bloodshot eyes, and locked hands;— every limb cramped with agony; and her lips trembling with blasphemy—to have seen her, as I saw her, all night long, delirious and red—God!—it would have shaken the stoutest heart, that was ever inhabited with life. What did this, sir? What hath left that beautiful tenement a wreck?—that shrine, a ruin?—that woman of power—a mass of dust and ashes—blood and corruption? What did it, sir? Look at me. It was her passions!” “I stood before her. I charged her with a conspiracy against the honour and peace of the newly married; the newly blessed;---with having driven two human beings into wedlock, for no other purpose than to break their hearts, and unsettle their minds, with jealousy and despair. She denied it. I charged her, in the name of the living God—in the presence of Jahovah and his angels. Still she denied it---but, while the words were upon her lip, she staggered and fell. The spirit of truth had touched her---but still she resisted. There was one more appeal. I desired a private interview. I entreated her not to put me to it. Nay, I would have forborne; but I dared not. I spoke a few words---no matter what they were---they related to an event in her own life---it is a secret, that will die with me. She knew not that any other human being, except her aunt Matilda, perhaps, had any suspicion of the truth. I demanded certain papers. Her countenance fell. I was appalled by the expression. She put her hand to her heart---and turned, as I thought, to her writing-desk, for the purpose of delivering the papers---when I saw her take something up ---raise her arm---and, the next moment, some liquid spurted into my eyes. I was blinded---but, when I came to my sight, I found that my hands were red. It was blood---I could not be deceived---I had seen it before.--- She was lying upon the floor; and the cry of murder, was ringing in my ear.” “The people of the house entered--and, seeing my face and hands bloody, and Jane lying at my feet, they never waited a moment; but attempted to pinion me. I was in no mood for such trifling. Should she die, what might be the consequences? There was only one course. It was a desperate one. I plucked out my knife---I brandished it. “Stand back!” I cried---“I will bury this in the heart of the first man that lays a finger on me, or speaks;---yet, I will not attempt to escape. Hear me!--- Jane, hear me! Declare that I am innocent of thy death ---this moment!---this moment!---or, by the God that made me, I will proclaim thy—” “Stop!---stop!---for heaven's sake, stop!”---cried Matilda; who was among the people that rushed in at the cry of murder---“She is trying to speak, now---leave her to me.” “Speak out, then,” I cried, “at once!--Speak! or—” “He is innocent;---it was my own hand!”---said the poor creature; and instantly died away, as I thought, forever.” “She recovered, however, a little, during the night. But circumstances rendered it necessary, that nobody, but Matilda and I, should watch with her. We did.--- And you may believe me---I have passed some terrible nights---many, many!---that few men would have survived;---but never did I pass a night---no, never!---so frightful and alarming as that. But I obtained what I wanted---the papers.” “She is now a wreck. God forgive her!---God, in his infinite mercy! And may her death-bed be a terrour to them, that give ay to any headlong passion.” Having said this, he left me. Such is the death of that extraordinary woman, Sarah. She was sorry, and very penitent, before her death, for all that she had done to Juliet; retracted a long and grievous fabrication about her; and signed it with her own blood---and, finally, forgave Molton, and blessed him—for what? I cannot imagine. What was that tremendous secret? Whence had he that power over her? I cannot imagine. Good night---I am sick, and weary, and dark---such a death-bed! J. OMAR.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">vol. ii. I EDWARD MOLTON TO GEORGE STAFFORD. The disorder has terminated. Another victim---another woman---queen-like and beautiful---made for dominion---have I seen, at my feet, weltering in her own blood. Another human being---another!---by the same dark and unsparing fatality, which has pursued me from my childhood, have I been the means of destroying, without even wishing for it. How is this, Stafford? How are we to account for that appetite for blood, which some men seem to have from nature? How are we to account, too, for that unerring certainty, with which a rebellious spirit is made to perform, whether it will or not, when it imagines itself the furthest from it, too, the decrees of heaven? I have just awakened, as from a long trance. I look at my almanack—at the papers that lie before me—and their dates would persuade me, that I have been asleep, or worse, for many weeks. Helen tells me, to be sure, that I have been very sick, very— but she does not tell me the truth, I fear. Stafford, I have been mad. Two months have passed, since I stood by a woman, who slew herself in my presence—whose hot blood spouted from her very heart, upon my lips and nostrils. My brain turned on the spot. I have just recovered—and all that has passed, for many a month, appears to me, like a dream. Nay, were it not for a certain feeling in my side; and certain spectres, that beset me, continually, sleeping or waking, I should be brought to question, very seriously, my own identity. Stay, I shall be unable to finish this, to-day. I must put it by; and when I am more entirely myself, I will renew the subject, upon which I wrote you last. What was it, Stafford? It is a long, long time since. Was it not theology? Or was it—Yes, it was painting. I remember it, now. ED. MOLTON.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SARAH TO JULIET. O, Juliet, I thank you, a thousand, and a thousand times, for your last kind letters. They came almost together—on account of some irregularity in the mail, I suppose. But why have I not heard from you, of late? Three months, nearly, since your last! Is the illness of Mr. Grenville so serious, that you cannot spare a line, dear? Perhaps a warmer climate would be a relief to him; and, I am sure, that, in the approaching cold weather, you would find it altogether more agreeable to be in Charleston, than New-York. It is the Montpelier of America, I am told; nay, I have experienced it;—only think how delightful it is, to breathe an air of perfume and warmth, in the very depth of December; to have the honeysuckle and jasmine in blossom about you; and to hear the waters gushing musically through the earth, tread where you will, like subterranean melody—visible musick, running in a steel-coloured, glittering labyrinth; among the grass, and star-lit fountains. Stay—this will never do. If I rave at this rate, you will think that there is something serious, in the influences here. But do not alarm yourself. The drawing master is gone.--- He came one day, and bade me good bye, with an air that was very becoming to him. I was quite affected, I declare, at the parting; for, every day, he was discovering some new and strange property—so that I had begun to find his society very necessary to me. Yes, Juliet, I am serious; and I never think of him, of late, without becoming more so. He has gone to Boston; and really, in a manner, and after a fashion, so entirely his own, that I never think of it without laughing. Let me tell you how it was. He had returned to Hallowell, it appears, where a class of young ladies had been forming for him, whil he was here. They were fine, intelligent, charming women, he says; and nothing would have given him more pleasure, than to remain and teach them, if his conscience would have permitted him to do it. I smiled to hear him speak of conscience. But he soon set me right; and, in three minutes, the tears stood in my eyes—for which I have been heartily ashamed ever since. His manner was inexpressibly solemn and affecting;—he acknowledged that he had trifled with sacred things; that he had spoken irreverently of the scriptures;—but, heretick as he was, (for he was of the faith of them that worship one God, and one only,) he had yet some sense of religion—some of duty—some of conscience. “Nay,” said he—and, extravagant as it was, I could not, for my soul, disbelieve him—“Nay,” said he, though I am cheerful, rash, and headstrong; yet, what I believe to be my duty, that will I do;---and if my life were, this moment, necessary to the happiness of mankind; or, if God signified to me, that the sacrifice would be acceptable to him, this moment would I lay it down; but I would lay it down in my own way---only from the conviction of my understanding. My martyrdom should be my own.” I was distressed, Juliet; and, before I knew it, had shaken hands, and parted with him, wishing him all the happiness in the world, half a dozen times, at least:--- and then, after all that, what do you think happened? Why, we sat down together, before a comfortable fire, and talked for a whole hour! He appeared to be in excellent spirits; yet, every minute or two, the conversation would flag---and his countenance, which is really noble, at times---full of meaning and soul---would change its whole expression, to an air so abstracted and melancholy, that I was sure his festivity was unnatural to him; and that I had never seen his true character till that moment. A silence would follow; for I preferred watching his face, to entertaining him with my tongue; which he would interrupt, every moment, by some sprightly sally, uttered at random, as if his thought were in another world---on times long gone by---or wandering into futurity. But, he has gone; and my days hang heavily upon me, now. I had just begun to learn his real character—a man of deep, but secret piety—proud—careless—and unhappy. I shall never forget his haughty blue eyes; nor their strange tenderness one night—when—but no, let me change the theme. Stay---I began to tell you of the manner, in which he left us. I shall try to tell the story in his own words, if possible. “I went to Hallowell, and began my school; but it would not do. Not that I did not get well paid, and plenty of employment; but my conscience would not be quiet. Among others, I have taught an amiable and sweet child, in a dozen or twenty lessons, how to colour, shamefully too, one picture! It was wretchedly done; and I never saw it without a spasm of the heart, particularly as I did not know what I was after, myself; nor how to amend my own blundering; the chief notion that I had of colouring, had been taken from the red, blue, and orange pictures, or tables, as they were called, over looking-glasses. Another constant trial,” said he, “was this:---There were a family of intelligent and accomplished girls in the neighbourhood, who, I have no doubt, had learnt the art properly; and, as they visited at this house, I was fearful that every hour would capsize me. These were the only coloured lessons that I gave; for the others, I had less fear---they were either in pencil drawing only, or Indian ink; and were, really, quite as tolerable as any that I had seen. How, indeed, was I to protect myself? There was only one way. I spoke of mine as a new style---Italian, of course---scorned all the older fashions; and ridiculed all the common methods, (of which I was supremely ignorant,) and invited comparison. This saved me. Every body could see a difference, and every body took it for granted that the difference was in my favour. I continued to eat and drink well, it is true, with my earnings; but I could not sleep. I felt that I was a scoundrel;---and so, one day, while this uncomfortable feeling was upon me, I happened to pop into a little room, appropriated to the Washington Benevolent Society; and to reading. I took up a paper. I saw an advertisement for a person, to conduct a wholesale and retail store, in Boston; good recommendations to be required, &amp;c.---the latter of which I knew that I might have, from anybody in my native town, if it were only to get rid of me. I, immediately, wrote to the printer, with the air of an old acquaintance, vol. ii. I 2 signing my true name---for it was impossible, I knew, that a man should remember the names of all that had been introduced to him; and my manner was exactly calculated to make him suppose that we were well acquainted, and that he had forgotten my name. The truth is---I had never seen the man in my life. I had never been in Boston, except once, when I ran away, and got lost, of a Sunday evening, in State-street---I wish I could stop to tell you all about it, but I cannot---and nearly ruined my poor master, who, to save expense of agency, had commissioned me to buy a handful or two of goods; under which authority, as his letter of credit was not limited. I took the liberty to buy whatever I took a fancy to---and left him to sell them, and pay for them, as he could---charging him with all the expenses of the journey, into the bargain! Well, I requested the printer, that I mentioned, to tell the advertiser that I was his man, when I knew his terms.” “This morning I have received a letter, from a man, that says, “Come to me directly. If we can agree, well; if we cannot, I will provide you with board, till you can find a place to suit yourself.” “I like this proposition---and as I have a prodigious hankering not to die a fool; an event that inevitably happens to a New-Englander'---(yes, Juliet, the creature is a yankee!)---“who dies, without having seen Boston, I have been about taking leave of my scholars, and shaking hands. I have received some blessings---a few tears, which were very precious to me---and about twice as many dollars, that were, at least, quite as indispensable; and now, Miss Ramsay, farewell! I hope that we may meet again.” “I hope so,” said I. “I do hope so, indeed. If you should write to any body here---and I know that you are a favourite with Dr. Plumber, and lawyer Kidder---for a bad reason, too, I hear; that of telling a good story---” “A reason that I am ashamed of; and have done with, forever,” said he, interrupting me. “If you should write to either of them, I shall be gratified to learn that you are well.” His eyes sparkled. “And there is another,” said I, archly, I thought, but be did'nt seem to think so, for he frowned---and departed. Farewell, Juliet. I am impatient to hear from you. S. R.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SAME TO SAME. Juliet, I am thunderstruck. Read the enclosed letter, and tell me, candidly, if I am to blame. I wrote to you yesterday, but to-day's post has brought me this; and, full of trepidation and uneasiness, I hasten to communicate to you, that---no---no, Juliet, you are now a married woman, and I cannot deal so freely with you, as I used. A strange thought just occurred to me; but, I must watch this tendency to the romantick; it will make me ridiculous some day or other. I look at it, again. I compare it. There is, certainly, a resemblance in the writing. But, what writing? Indeed, my dear, I cannot tell you; unless, by some chance, I should meet this Mr. Randolph, again; when, I am determined to know who and what he is. Behold his letter. I have not answered it, of course; and I had opened it, before I suspected that it was his; or, most assuredly, I should have returned it to him, at once, in a blank envelope. But, I had read it; and, after reading it, that would have been affectation and cruelty. No, I could not so rebuke him, now. I might, at first; but I should not dare to do it, now, without deep consideration. Perhaps he took my last words as a hint to write to me—but I hope not.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SPENCER RANDOLPH TO MISS RAMSAY. Boston, —. That you may know, at once, all that you have to apprehend, Miss Ramsay, I have chosen to write my name in the very top of this letter. It is from Spencer Randolph. Have you the courage to proceed?—the magnanimity? If you have, let me counsel you to proceed. You will find nothing to make you repent of it. But, if you tremble—if you have not the fullest confidence in yourself, and me—I pray you, I entreat you, to return it. Do not proceed. If you do—mark me—you will have contributed directly to an event, of which you do not even dream at this moment. Yes, if you read this letter, that event will certainly happen. Dare you go on? Yes, you will. You are, probably, distressed at the liberty that I have now taken. You ask yourself, what I have seen in your conduct to encourage me. I answer nothing—nothing, Miss Ramsay—or nothing, except your independent tone of feeling, and sound practical good sense. They have encouraged me. I do not deny it. But, to do what? Not to violate any duty, any law, even of decorum; not to intrude myself, unbidden, upon the thought of a woman, that I respect. No. What then? Merely to converse to her—not even with her. I do not ask you, Miss Ramsay, to reply to me. That were more than I could expect, even from your independence. I only ask you to listen. Is there any fallacy in this? You have not been afraid to listen to my conversation. Are you afraid to read it. But the world may know it. And is that a reason, Miss Ramsay, why we should not do what is innocent? The world know that I have conversed with you; that I have visited you; and that you have received me kindly. Was there any danger in this? No. Any reproach? No. Is there more peril now, that I shall corrupt or poison you, by my writing? Then why any fastidiousness? Reflect for yourself. What makes those men, who associate habitually with women, superiour to others?--- What makes that woman, who is accustomed to, and at ease in, the company of men, superiour to her sex in general? Why are the women of France so universally admired and loved for their colloquial power? Solely because they are in the habit of a free, and graceful, and continual conversation with the other sex. Women, in this way, lose their frivolity; their faculties awaken; their delicacies and peculiarities, emit their own perfume; and unfold all their beauty and captivation, in the spirit of intellectual rivalry. And the men lose their pedantick, rude, declamatory, or sullen manner. The coin of the understanding, and the heart, is interchanged continually. Their asperities are rubbed off; their better material polished and brightened; and their richness, like fine gold, is wrought into finer workmanship by the fingers of women, than it ever could be, by those of men. The iron and steel of our character, are hidden, like the harness and armour of a giant, in studs and knobs of gold and precious stone, when not wanted in actual warfare. In England, men show their own estimate of female conversation, by never exposing themselves to it, if they can help it—preferring the bottle to it—the race-course —the gambling table—clubs—and routes—where women are never seen, or never expected to converse. In France, men adjourn from the table, like rational creatures, to the parlour, the very name of which is a compliment to the women, where they sit and converse with rational females, from choice—or flirt with irrational ones, for amusement. But, in England, how is it? The men drive the women from the table; and sit, and guzzle wine, till they can't see out of their eyes—rather than listen to their conversation. Have I said enough? Will you permit me to write to you? You have nothing to fear. I shall do it hut seldom; and will never offend you. I anticipate your answer. You hesitate—you are undecided; but, at length, you will consent. I foresee that you will; and I thank you for it. If I should be mistaken, you have only to return one of my letters, unopened, and you will never hear from me, again. I am now in Boston—probably, behind the counter of the greatest scoundrel in it. I have just learnt that fact; and shall leave him, immediately. Not an hour has passed, since I was on the point of throwing him out of his own window, into his wife's lap, (a charming woman, by the way,) as she sat, working muslin, at her own, just opposite, with a narrow alley between us. He charged me with having done something underhanded. It was an unlucky word—and I insisted upon an explanation. Happily, for him, he thought of one. “Did'nt I pass you, the other day,” said he, “when you were writing at the desk?” And did'nt you, as I passed, put your hand over the paper, to conceal it? Your hand was over it—the paper was under it;—was'nt that underhanded work, then?” What could I say? Nothing. So, I shall leave him, in about an hour—to do, God only knows what—for, I have fallen acquainted with a young haram-scarum chap, with more money than brains, who has a prodigious notion of going into business. I shall write to you, again, one day or other—for, it is in vain to deny it, next to the pleasure of talking, is that of writing another to death. There is this great advantage, too, in writing, over conversation---that I can take up just as much time as I please, without the risk of being interrupted, and have the talking all to myself. But, I cannot bid you good bye, without telling you how I got the recommendation required, from the people of my native town. They were cautious fellows; and, much as they desired to be quit of me, yet there was no knowing what might happen on my way to Boston; and it would be, they thought, rather an awkward thing to read, that a young man was taken up, on suspicion of some fact, or other, (though, if they had known me well, they would never suspect me of anything like a fact,) in whose pocket was found a paper, recommending him to all whom it might concern, signed by several respectable merchants of —. I don't say where, for I have still some respect for my native town, and for the mother that bore me. Well, as soon as I was ready to depart, I went round to every man that I thought sufficiently a stranger to me, for my purpose; and asked him, resolutely, to give me a certificate of my worth, and talent, and probity—(not property—I beg that you will be careful how you pronounce that word—for I never was so far gone as to demand such a certificate)—and all that. They hemmed and hawed—and invited me to call again—as often as I pleased:—in some places, a partner was out—in others, a principal—and some did'nt know what to write—and some could'nt write at all. I saw that all were afraid to begin; so, I sat down, and wrote a recommendation of myself, and thrust it into the first man's face that I caught, with a countenance that proved to him, that it was better to sign anything, than put me to the trouble of calling again. In this way, by downright travail of spirit, I obtained six signatures. With them, I arrived in Boston:—and, the next morning, at day-light, my temples throbbing with the noise of the streets; and my feet smarting and sore with the pavement, I found out the “wholesale and retail store.” The prospect, I confess, was none of the pleasantest, at first;—and, before I made myself known to the master, one of the most orthodox of human creatures—undergoes family prayer, regularly, every night, without considering it in my salary—and locks his very kittens apart— male and female—and cheats, like no man on earth, except himself—I ascertained that his assortment of goods, at wholesale, consisted of refuse looking-glasses—Attlebury-jewelry—tea, by the pound—remnants of calico —and the fag end of all the auction rooms in Christendom. Yet, I enlisted. Don't you pity me? We struck a bargain directly. Adieu, Miss Ramsay.—Heaven bless you! SPENCER RANDOLPH.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">MOLTON TO STAFFORD, IN CONTINUATION. I am altogether better to day, dear Stafford, than I have been for a whole week; better in health, and better in spirits. I am thinking to pay you a visit soon—perhaps before the winter is fairly set in. Let me commence then with the paintings of our country, just as they occur to me. At Faneuil Hall, Boston, I remember having seen a noble picture of Washington, full length, with his horse, and perhaps a negro, by Stuart. There was little to astonish one in it—except that it was Stuart's. And not long after, there was a picture called the Landing of the Fathers,” painted by a Col. Sargeant of that place. I saw it---but I was a boy then, and the only recollection I have now of it is, that all the faces appeared to have been taken from the same study. It is now destroyed, by some accident, I am told; or, such at least is the impression upon my mind---I cannot pretend to judge of it from such a recollection; for I was then too young and too ignorant to know whether there was any merit in it or not---but the same artist has just painted a piece called the DINNER PARTY, after the manner of the “Capuchin Chapel,” which I am told, is so admirable as to deceive dogs; or, at least, one dog. The creature, it is said, had been taught to stand upon its hind legs, and beg, when it came near the table; and that, when it entered the room, where this picture was exhibited, deceived probably by an admirable painted imitation of the smell of roast beef---it arose as usual, and stood on its hind legs. I have not seen the picture, but have heard that it is a singularly spirited and effectual delusion.[6] [6] Alas!—I have just seen his “MESSIAH ENTERING JERUSALEM.” It is a national reproach. The man does'nt understand the alphabet of his art; not even the elements. He is ignorant of lineal and serial perspective—drawing—colouring—and grouping. He does'nt even know how to mix his paints. The faces are copied from prints—and have no common expression—no unity of design—tell no story at all. There is not even a fine passage in it—except at the left-the sky and a group—nearly at the same distance as another group, about half the same height. There is no common centre-no place of attraction or repose. The Saviour is drunk—and the people so crowded together, and so distorted, that you are convinced that he began in the fore ground, and worked in the faces, wherever he could find a blank, any how—to fill up—in profile, or front—up or down. Not a foot is to be seen —why? He could'nt paint a foot—not a hand, that is'nt either without an owner—too far from the body—too large—or totally out of drawing, and destitute of expression. It is, I say it again, a shame and a reproach to the country.—Ed. You remember the curtain and fruit. Do you believe the story? I can tell you something like it, within my own experience. An old maid lived in my mother's family---who had a mortal antipathy to cats, and took snuff in such quantities, that, when she hung any of her clothes out in the wind, it would set the whole neighborhood a sneezing:---nay, although she has been buried many years, yet, it is said to be impossible to go by the grave to this day, without saluting it with the same noise. She had her picture painted. It stood upon a chair, in a room dimly lighted. In the next room she had found a young kitten, which she whipped out of her presence with her snuffy pocket handkerchief. The poor kitten ran, for her life, half blinded and choking, into this room---there she paused, for a single moment, to recover herself, when, happening to see the picture, she squawled out, jumped up, all four of her feet from the floor, and darted by it, like a devil. But—seriously, dear Stafford—seriously—I must take up the subject, more magisterially. At New-York, I know of nothing worth attention —in the way of painting, except a painting of Trumbull's, whose least pictures are always the greatest. But when you get to Philadelphia, there are several pictures, by Mr. West himself. The first is Ophelia—a tame, badly contrived, feeble thing. The next is Lear in the Tempest; a grand conception, with some gigantick features in it;—but crowded and encumbered to such a degree, as to make you feel uncomfortably, while standing before it. The drapery is beautiful; nay, it is more than beautiful; it is magnificent—but heavy and unnaturally voluminous. About the old King's legs are wrapped and muffled such a weight of it, as, you are sure, no mortal man could support. Yet it is kingly—there is no denying that. The character is well developed in Lear's face; and his attitude is full of wrath, terrour, dominion and madness. But the features are all marvellous— preternatural—and the hands too large,—and the folds of heavy cloth, swelling in the wind, are contradictory; for example, there is a garment of blood colour, swaying off from one of the left hand figures, as if the tempest blew from the right;—yet, over the head of the same person, another fold is blown, by the wind, in a direction exactly opposite---as if the wind came from the left. vol. ii. K The next thing that I remember there, is “Christ healing he sick.” To judge of it, you must read the beautiful criticism which I enclose to you. It is printed in a pamphlet form; and given to every visitor —for twelve and a half cents. This picture is the pride of Philadelphia, and almost of America: and it would be thought little better than blasphemy for one to imagine any fault in it. Yet some how---it were difficult to tell why---perhaps, in the mere spirit of contradiction; for it is our nature, when we see people at one extreme, to fly exactly to the opposite one, that our rebuke, of their extavagance, may be the more forcibly felt—I could see little to wonder at in this marvellous pictures. I happened to visit it, while it was the fashion to be in raptures---at anything, and every thing, with that cold hearted, calculating people. A gentleman---exceedingly pretty-behaved---rhetorical and travelled too, I found, was holding forth, to the utter discomfiture of many that knew more than he, of painting, to a circle of women. Nobody interrupted him---nobody contradicted him;---and every one that heard him, seemed to echo his thought. This put me to thinking. He was noisy. I was silent. His countenance---it was really a fine one---was breaking out into continual sunshine---but his heart was unaffected. He had come to declaim, not to criticise---to play off the connoisseur, not to feel. I had just finished reading the pamphlet. He approached me---for there was an air of discontent, I am sure, in my countenance; and, as I had been one of the most patient of his listeners---he felt somewhat flattered. What a pity, I thought, that he cannot read my heart, at this moment. “Is'nt it the finest thing in the world, sir!” said he--- “I see that you have studied it, with attention--an amateur ---an artist---if I may be so bold, sir---I---pray— a---a—.” I looked at the man---very calmly---and he stopped, where he was, with a low bow—; yet, unwilling to be utterly disconcerted, he prepared to carry it off, with the air of one, that was only amusing himself with another. “Sir,” said I---“you have put me to it. I shall speak as plainly as you. That is not a great picture. It is full of faults---and the critick, he who wrote that book, never saw the picture. I am sure of it. Somebody, the artist himself perhaps, employed him, and described his own intention. Hear me for a moment.---The criticism is beautiful, very vigorous and original---but see here. The critick says, that the brightest ray of light, issues between that index finger and thumb;---and that the light passes off from that, into the chiaro oscuro. It is false.--- There is the brightest ray of light,---exactly where it ought not to be,---about the golden candlestick. The critick says, that the power of Mr. West, is to be seen chiefly in his daring exhibition of contrast;---and that, he has opposed the beautiful neck of a youthful woman, to the emaciated and shrunken aspect of an old man, her father, whom she supports. Look at it—is that a beautiful neck? Is it not cadaverous, wasted,—unlovely— and properly so—for, has not the daughter been watching by the bed side of her poor sick father? Thus then, that neck is not beautiful—nor should it be so. But turn your eyes there, to the left;—and there you see one of the most beautiful necks in the world—contrasted with the hand of an old man, resting upon the daughter's head.— That was the contrast, of which the artist gave the critick notice—but the critick, never having seen the picture, committed that ridiculous blunder. And here too —he speaks of the appearance of returning life, in the extremities of the sick man, as they are approaching the Saviour. A beautiful thought, I confess—but I look in vain for the appearance. Can you see anything of it? I cannot, I confess.” “Again—the critick dwells, with singular emphasis, upon the sublime conception, and desperate courage of Mr. West, in opposing the light, which flows from the head of the Saviour, to that which flows from the golden candlestick, the holy of holies. An ordinary man would never have thought of this, says the critick, and most assuredly would never have risked them together. But observe the thought. The holy of holies, is an emblem of the Jewish dispensation. The light, from it, is faint and dying. But, the lustre that escapes, like a vapour, from the head of Christ, is made to overpower and darken the lustre of the former; showing, thereby, that, in the light of the new dispensation, all the ritual of the old, even in its brightness, waned and darkened. This would be all very well—very well, indeed; but the misfortune is, that it is not true;—nay, that the truth is exactly the reverse. Instead of the light from the Saviour's head, overpowering that from the candlestick—the latter overpowers the former! so that, it resembles more the sickly splendour of corruption, than, the raying of divinity. Now I object at once, and decidedly, to that notion of encompassing Christ's head, or the head of an apostle, or martyr, with a halo, or a glory. It is—as if one should write under it, “Here is a saint—” or, “Here is a Christ.” The power and beauty of Christ, must appear in his countenance, and deportment; and not, in the foolish conceit of a glory.” “Look at his face, too. Is it Jewish? No.—It is the face of a handsome young Englishman. Look at the balancing of his hands. Where is the benignity and composure; the serenity and sweetness; or, the awful beauty and grandeur of Christ, of which you have heard so much? Not in that picture, I am sure. It is crowded too, to suffocation; the integrity, wholeness, and singleness of the piece, is broken up. Where is the principal figure?—where does the eye seek, naturally, to repose? Upon the centurion. What think you of him? the anatomy—the attitude?—Is it natural? Look at the colouring—that dirty blue dress, of the Saviour—is that what it should be?—But why need I trouble you with these opinions? You are a Philadelphian; and, though I am sure that they are making their impression, even while that smile is upon your lip; and that, when I am away, you will probably change your opinion of the picture; and, probably, see some of the very faults that I have pointed out, yet, I cannot hope that you will acknowledge any of them now—and in this place—in this company.” “But do you know the history of that painting?—It is a failure—a miserable failure, for Benjamin West;— and the cause is a natural one. He was weary of the subject. This was the third time that he had painted it; and, in worrying himself for improvement, he has spoiled the unity of design. His first attempt was a mere sketch—but was wonderful. It was the astonishment and delight of Europe.—It was only done up, in the heat and vehemence of the conception, with brown and white. But, after many years, he copied it, for the purpose of presenting it to the Pennsylvania hospital, as the tribute of one, who was under some unaccountable obligation to that, or to the state—I do not exactly know which. He finished it; but the Royal Academy offered him three thousand guineas for it.[7] [7] No—it was not three thousand guineas. Ed. and a compliment into the bargain. That was irresistable. They were unwilling to part with it—they wanted it as a perpetual study, for the youthful; they did not pretend to offer three thousand guineas as its value; but, merely, as all that the funds of the society would admit.—So—that picture, which was worth a dozen of this, was sold to the Egyptians. But his word had been given—and Mr. West, as an honest man, felt obliged to redeem it. He therefore attempted to copy;—but, he so altered, and qualified, and diluted the spirit and simplicity of the second, which was greatly inferior to the first—that his third is —just what you see there.—Good morning, sir.— Ladies, I wish you a very good morning.” There, dear Stafford—it is bed time—and I shall take up the subject again, soon.—Good night. ED: MOLTON. P. S.—“The battle of North Point,” &amp;c. Ah, I had quite forgotten your questions. But, will answer them now, briefly. General Harper is a great general. I say it seriously. I hold his military talent to be superiour to that of any other man, in our country. He had little to do there—but, that you may understand how much generalship there was exhibited, by them that had more to do, I will mention one fact. They threw about two thousand vol. ii. K 2 men—in advance—as a corps of observation—exactly where they expected an attack—for what purpose? —to mask all their own batteries!—their whole line of entrenchments—one would think. The British were expected; and, if they had brought this body to the charge, one of two things must have been the consequence:—every man must have been bayonetted, or taken prisoner;—or, must have fallen back, upon the American lines, with the British. They were the flower of Baltimore—the young men; and, had the attack been made, the militia and artillery would have been useless to the Americans; for the lines would have been carried, at the point of the bayonet—the whole British army, at the heels of the two thousand Americans—entering with them; and the artillery would not have been used, by the Americans— for, they would be firing on their own men. Such, was the able disposition after the battle at North Point. Believe me, nothing but the accidental loss of General Ross, saved the city of Baltimore; and yet, the Americans were brave enough, and numerous enough, to eat the British, had they been properly officered. I spoke with one of the officers; a brave, obstinate fellow, who was among this two thousand. He had resolved; when brought to the charge, not to retreat—not to fall back—but, if he sacrificed every man under his command, to break his way through the enemy. The plan was a desperate one; but, it was the only one, that could have saved the main body; and would have been carried into execution. A victory! pshaw—we had better hold our tongues about the matter. It is a national reproach to us, that we did not take your whole army prisoners. We should have done it, but for two or three blundering militia commanders.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">JOHN TO SARAH. Philadelphia, —. I have just arrived, dear Sarah;—and, from the hour of my departure, until my landing at Jamaica, I had never an opportunity of sending you a line, or explaining the cause of my absence. Frank was sick—and the boat that brought me the letter, was ready to sail again, before I received it. In an hour I had embarked; and now I hope that you will forgive my long silence, and be charitable to me, and kind, and tell me all that has happened to you, in that cold climate of yours. Mr. Grenville suffers, cruelly; and he has just determined to visit the Havana.—Juliet would go with him; but her health is very delicate, about this time, and he will not permit her to think of it. Her deportment is full of the most piteous and tender solicitude; every movement of her lip; every emotion of her face, is earnest with affection, altogether unlike the timid eyeing, and passionate low-breathing, of Juliet Gracie. There is a composure now, in her very sweetness; a dignity, a serene, womanly self-possession, altogether worthy of Juliet Grenville—and her husband is so conscious of all this; so grateful for it, that I can hardly look upon him, feeble and wasted as he is, without a feeling of envy. Upon my word, Sarah, when I gaze about me, and find two such women as Juliet, and—may I name her?—Helen—so full of love and watchfulness, so beautiful and so sincere—one, all passion and enthusiasm; the other all mildness and purity, with a spirit of trancendent power, tempered only, not extinguished, by gentleness—yet, both loving, almost to adoration, the men of their hearts—O, I could lay me down and weep for melancholy, that there is no such woman for me—no dear one, who will watch the changing of my countenance, as something upon which her destiny is dependent—the deepening of my lips—or eyes—as matter essential to the comfort of her heart—no blessed one, to whom I can turn in sorrow and desolation, and feel her soft arms twining about my neck—her warm cheek upon mine, and her beautiful hair blowing about my eyes. Ah, no, Sarah;—there is to be no such luxury for me. I have lived and mingled with the world; communed and dwelt with many women; lovely and innocent ones—and counterfeited many passions; but never to this hour, have I found one to love me—never;—and I shall go to my grave, unhonoured and unknown; no woman to weep for my memory; no children to bless me—none to remember that I have been. Year after year, hath passed away; and many have stood up before me, thrilling with passion for one another, and received the benediction of love; yet I have been, forever, desolate and alone. No heart ever beat against mine; no lips ever tingled with the touch of mine;—no step ever faltered; no voice ever changed, when mine was heard. Yet, what have I done? Who can charge me with ought of impurity or licentiousness? Why then are my faculties wasting away—the inexhaustible tenderness of my heart, like a secret fountain, left unbroken and unvisited, to sink into the sand—feeling no emotion, creating none. Is it that I have been too good? Can it be, that, to women, there is a witchery and enchantment in the aspect of profligacy. The licentious are beloved—the wicked are married—doated on, to distraction and death. The sound of their voice thrills like electricity, through many a pure heart; the glance of their eye penetrates and dissolves. At the touch of their hand, soothed, and subdued, the lovely and wise, bow down their heads to the dust; loosen their tresses; and weep to be embraced.—O, Woman! What a lesson is this to the virtuous—what discouragement to self-denial and greatness. Can it be true, that, familiarity with the profligate, hath a spell for the faculties; and that he, who hath spoiled and rifled many a precious heart, is, therefore, more seductive and winning—more courted, even by the virtuous and pure;—for the enchantment of his manner, perhaps—for his reformation, it is said;—and as a trial? But is it not a lesson to the good—doth it not teach them, that there is an attractiveness in manner, to be sought after, unlike the austerity of virtue—an attractiveness that is delirium to woman. Shall the wise and good learn this—or shall they abandon it to the dishonourable and profligate?—Sarah—is it not the fault of women, that virtue is ashamed to show its face; that it is obliged to counterfeit the deportment of vice, ere it can obtain admission to woman? Is it not a reproach to you? And is it not true? Who are her favourites?— What their history? Is it not full of seduction and death? Deliberate villany, and idolatrous passion? It is. And who are rejected and abandoned?—The tame and spiritless?—the unfashionable?—They are the men that live, as men ought to live—men, that feel their accountability to heaven—that approach woman with a breathless awe, ready to bleed and die for her—but unable, in the faintness of their heart and voice, to trifle with her loveliness; trembling in her presence, as if in the temple of something consecrated—faltering at her approach, like them that are conscious of angelick visiting, or invisible guardianship;—afraid to imagine aught that is earthly or sensual. Yet!—such men are ridiculed—their veneration laughed at; and themselves shunned. They are right—women are right---the presence of such men is a perpetual and burning sarcasm upon them.---Who that hath so much of mortality and infirmity, as women, could endure to be approached, by such infatuated and mistaken worshippers. Every ascription of praise is an insult. If the heart stop in its awe---there are cruelty and bitterness in it; for what can be more cruel and bitter, than to approach a woman as if she were something more spiritualized, more etherial, than the daughters of earth. Is it not saying that she ought to be---what she is not. It is burning incense to Chastity, before the image of Mary Magdalene, or the woman of Samaria. Farewell, JOHN OMAR.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">JULIET TO SARAH. Yes—he did take it for an invitation; nor, was it wonderful.—You did not mean it as one, I am convinced; but you said about as much, dear Sarah, as that you would be glad to hear from him. I have read his letter, with perfect astonishment. It is the most impudent, familiar, and presumptuous thing, that I ever saw. Did you not think so? “Shall you answer it?” you ask. Answer it? You answer that letter! Why, Sarah, I can hardly believe my senses; that, you should not have returned it, instantly, is a matter of astonishment to me; you who have been so cold and prudent:—but that you should think of answering it;—that is past my comprehension. You were more intimate with him, than I had any suspicion of; or, he has, beyond all comparison, the most assurance of any human being, to write you such a letter.— —Perhaps I am too much in earnest—too plain spoken. I hope not, dear Sarah, for I would soothe—not irritate your poor heart, at such a moment. Who is this Randolph?—what is he?—Sarah Ramsay cannot answer me that:—no, not even Sarah Ramsay, that woman of strength and decision; she, who was always so prompt and energetick, and circumspect; yet, Sarah Ramsay is, disquieted, when he hath left her—acknowledges it—is anxious to see him again: repeats, with emphasis, his wild and improbable tale—a tale, that shows him to be an unprincipled impostor, even if it be true: permits his hand to rest upon her shoulder, for some minutes, without being aware of it;—suffers him to swear, more than once, in her presence;—nay, repeats his profanity, levity, and irreligion,—and, finally, receives, reads, and does not return to him, a letter, which he had the audacity to address to her. Sarah, I thought that I knew you well. I did not. There is something in your character, recently developed, which is new to me, unexpected, and alarming. Am I taking too great a liberty?—Dear Sarah, I will not believe it. The time is not yet come, when, between Juliet and Sarah, the plain language of truth and soberness, shall be offensive or hateful. I am married too, you will recollect, my dear, strange sister— and that gives me many privileges, as a counseller and matron. Who is this man? I ask again. I would have you find out? but, I would never have him suspect it. You affect to treat the matter with levity; you are remarkably direct and ingenuous. Do not deceive yourself; you are in danger; and, were I not sure of it, I would not, for the world, awake you to the knowledge of a secret so alarming. Yet, I must—Randolph is dear to you. Yet, you do not know it. Your heart was in sorrow, and he came to it. You were lonely and dependant. He kept up your spirits, and startled you, with his originality. You were proud, and cold. He determined to subdue you—by a careless indifference. He has succeeded. You are more in his power, than he dreams of. I am glad that he is gone—very glad. But I give you no advice, dear;—consult your own understanding—be prudent, and leave the rest to heaven.— Examine your own heart, as with a knife; and then, my own dear Sarah, let me pray you to act, as you would have done, a year ago, had such an adventurer thrown himself in your way. Am I unkind, uncharitable, ungenerous? I cannot afford to be generous, my sister, where, to give away aught of indulgence, is to give away something of your happiness. I cannot be charitable, at least, not very charitable, to such levity, assurance, and avowed demerit as his. And, I must not be kind to one, who has so unkindly; so unaccountably, too, let me say, trespassed upon the solitary and benighted heart of a proud, high-minded woman; yet, a woman, that was sincerely pious; until she, herself, has learned to repeat his impiety. Sarah, I know that I am severe—and I hope that it will be undeserved—I hope so, indeed. I would rather endure thy rebuke, in return, than that thou shouldst deserve mine, for a single instant. It makes my heart bleed, when I think, how lonely and exposed thou art. Yet, do not believe, Sarah, that I have any feeling of hostility or resentment, against this man, on account of his profession; or, that I would be angry at his familiarity, because he is poor. No—mine is not such pride. I respect poverty; but I would have the poor man honest, and prudent; wise and religious—and, I should not like him the less, for a little modesty. * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * My poor husband is quite unwell. At times—oh, Sarah, I am in need of consolation; and now that my heart, which has been kept up till this moment, thinking only of thee, is left to itself—I am almost blinded with my tears. Grenville is unwell; and I am afraid that I must lose him, for a time. How shall I exist without him, Sarah; and now, too, when the presence of a husband is as necessary, almost, to my support and sustenence, as the feeling that there is a God, and a good God, forever about me. Perhaps I am in a perilous way, myself, dear Sarah. I have many fears; much sickness at the heart, and strange tremours, that alarm me, inexpressibly; the more, probably, from the fact, that, in my present situation, it will be impossible for me to accompany my husband abroad; and that in his, it will be equally impossible for him to be with me, in the hour of peril and agony.—I have a melancholy foreboding, Sarah; a superstitious apprehension upon me, that I am ashamed of, even while I submit to it. The period, it is true, is some what distant; but, I feel every blow of the clock, upon my heart:—nay, within it, like a creature, waiting for death, and certain that it is at hand. Yet, these, I am told, are the common apprehensions of women, in my situation, for the first time. Every thing alarms them; their spirits are forever in travail, and they suffer inconceivably, in their anticipation. I wish that I were wiser; more confident; and, at least, as well prepared for death, as I have been. But now—O, Sarah, I cannot think of it, without quaking. I am in health now; happy, loving and beloved; and, if I die now, it will be suddenly; without that lingering, wasting, wearing preparation, which reduced me, gradually, before. And yet, there is a sweet thrilling in my veins; a rich, warm flooding of my poor heart, at times, when I think how many have escaped---how many, that were weaker than I—how many, that think little of the peril;---and that, if I do escape, and should be so blessed---O, merciful Father---let me but live to embrace a creature that owes its little life to me, and then, O, no—I could not then, consent to die—I could not— it would break my heart, to think of leaving its helplessness, to the mercenary. O, no—if I must die, it were better, perhaps, that I should die now—nay—I cannot think even of that.—Father!—Father!—thy will be done. Do thou support and sustain me, in the coming trial! Teach me to submit to it, whatever it be, unaided, and alone, without repining! And, if it be, that I am to endure the agony of a mother, with no father, no husband near me, to feel with me, to pray for me, to weep for me, to support my fainting spirit, and bless the babe that is born to him—O, do thou, thou! O my Father, be with me; and let thy care be upon him, wherever he may be; afar off—and sorrowing, for his wife,—O, wilt thou! J. R. G. P. S.—Why did you not send me the original of Mr. Randolph's letter? Why copy it? Was it so precious, so very precious to you?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">EDWARD MOLTON TO GEORGE STAFFORD. (In continuation.) The next picture that I will attempt a description of, dear Stafford, is the Passage of the Delaware, by Mr. Sully, of whom I spoke the other day, in enumerating some of our portrait painters. It is a spirited and beautiful conception, rapidly and confidently wrought out; but was never meant for a downright historical picture. It is rather a Portrait of Washington, where the subordinate figures, and filling up, are not sufficiently subordinate, than The Passage of the Delaware: and the history of it is not a little amusing. Mr. Sully was employed by the corporation of Charleston to paint vol. ii. L a portrait of Washington, after his own fashion: the price was limited, and the space of unoccupied wall assigned, beyond which, he could not trespass. Mr. S. began his work; and, full of his natural enthusiasm and fire, generated this picture, without any regard to the paltry sum ($500, I believe,) which he was promised for it. It was nearly finished, when, after some troublesome correspondence; and some revolution in the city government, he had the mortification to find that this picture, like that of the family of Wakefield, was altogether too big for the house. But, let us go back to the time, when the proposal was made to him. What was to be done? His profession was portrait painting;---he had a large family to support; and, passionately desirous, as he was, to employ his power upon the historical department; to evolve the passions in all their shadowing ---to call up the apparitions of the past,---give immortality to the present---and summon, from the untenanted chambers of futurity, the bodiless forms that are there:--- clothe them with flesh and muscle---infuse into them meaning and passion---and give to them the noblest of all expression---dramatick individuality: it was putting his very existence at hazard, even to trespass, for a day, upon the historical department. Once over the barrier, it would break his heart to return; and yet, if he were not paid for his labour, he would be oblige to return, at the peril of starvation to a large family. Much as he panted for adventure---these were reasons to deter him from it. Yet---the time might come, he thought, when he could loosen the bands that bound him, and unfetter his genius ---it might!---and where would be the peril, if he ventured abroad, a little, to feel the publick, in this portrait of Washington, without actually invading the great territories of history. There would be some peril, to be sure, in the hazardous ordeal, to which he would have to expose it, before a cold hearted, mercenary people; a people essentially ignorant of the art; and boastful of their very ignorance. Yet---he resolved to encounter it all. He made a noble picture. He threw in, with a confident heart, a good quantity of bold, simple colouring; enough of finish for the occasion; powerful association; and great attitude---capital drawing---and that kind of repose in the expression, which makes the heart of a man thoughtful, in looking at the picture, as if himself were on the precipice of some great adventure. He did this---stepped aside, and withdrew the curtain. Some people went to see the Passage of the Delaware; and some a PORTRAIT of George Washington, at full length. Both came away dissatisfied. It wanted the singleness, the unity, and imposing reality of a portrait. And there were not enough great features uniting, at once, in one great expression, for historical painting. It was a little crowded, they said. (By they, I mean that class of criticks, whom you may see, at exhibitions, looking solemnly through their own hands—at portraits)—much too crowded. True—but he was painting an embarkation: and men are not very regular and formal, at such a season. The manner of Washington, said they, is too full of poetry; he is too youthful. Ah!—thought I—these people forget that Washington was only about forty years old at the time. They compare him with Stuart's Washington, who was twenty years older. These, with a multitude of other opinions, quite as ridiculous, went their round for a time; and few even took the trouble to ask themselves what had been the object of the painter. Had they, they would have found that he had done all that he attempted. And what more could any man do? After learning from the Charleston gentry that they had made a mistake, in giving the dimensions, Mr. Sully, as Mr. West had done before him, thought it right to make a publick exhibition of the picture; for, in a country like ours, such a picture would never sell for a quarter of its value; and, unless an artist were rich enough to amuse himself, by painting pictures to give away; or, wise enough to exhibit them for money, there would be no encouragement for him to labour here. But I doubt if he has been even tolerably rewarded for it. It would interest you, dear Stafford, to know something of his character, countenance, and history. Such a knowledge gives value and interest to whatever a man does. It is like going behind a curtain of creation; and studying the machinery of the universe. It is looking into the elements of the human heart, before they are compounded or embroiled. Mr. Sully is a small, but remarkably active, well-made man; with a countenance expressive of a fiery spirit, pretty well subdued—courteous, mild, and unassuming in his manner; and has, I do believe, one of the kindest hearts in the world. His history—I wish I were at liberty to tell you;---but, while it is infinitely honourable to him, and no matter of confidence among those who know him; yet, as it was communicated to me, by a man, when his heart ran over, I do not feel myself authorized to speak of it—except in very general terms. From other sources, I have learnt this,—that his passion for painting showed itself early; and that, when quite a boy, he was on the point of abandoning it, forever, with a feeling of discouragement and mortification; and was only prevented by a letter which he found, by accident, just as he was about to embark, for a place, where he meant to go into the naval service of this country. About the same time, he left off miniature painting—upon which he began; and, in which he had made some proficiency, in consequence of meeting with an oil picture of Angelica Koffman's. He placed it upon a table—stood before it —studied it—felt the inspiration that he had waited for so long, flooding his whole heart, like a fountain, suddenly unsealed in a barren place. From that moment, he devoted himself to oil portraits;—and, not long after, an event occurred to him, so honourable to human nature, that, I must tell it. We have a tragedian here, named Cooper. You have heard of him, perhaps. He is a countryman of yours, by birth; but his education has been with us. He is an ambitious man; full of heroick and sublime movement upon the stage; and, from the fact which I am about to communicate, I am as ready to believe, as full of high hearted and generous feeling, off the stage. He met Mr. Sully in a small city at the South, and urged him to go to New-York. How shall I go?—said Mr. Sully. I am employed here—and— “How are you off for cash?” said Mr. C. without any circumlocution. “Rather low,” was the reply—“a few dollars, and but a few.” “Well, then—give yourself no trouble about that. Go to New-York. I will answer for your success; and, as far as one thousand dollars will be of use to you, they are at your service.” What was a proud, high-spirited fellow, full of ambition and passionate love, for his art, to do, in such a case? Mr. Sully accepted the offer—went to New York— succeeded;—and was, soon after, sent out to London, by subscription, to copy certain paintings of the ancient masters. And here, another anecdote occurs to me, alike honourable to another man; nay, to the whole species, for it makes us think better of ourselves, and of all mankind, when we find such beings about us. We are proud of our relationship to such men. A gentleman, whom he met at dinner, about the time of his departure for England, in the course of a conversation, over the wine, with Mr. S. begged him, if he were ever in the way of using it, to draw on him, to the amount of five thousand dollars, (I believe.) Mr. S. thanked the gentleman for his kindness, and thought no more of it; but the next day, the same person, (I forget his name—but he had been a man of fortune—and is now, I believe, in the East Indies, whence he will never return, until he be a man of fortune again,) called upon him. “It was an offer,” said he, “made of a Sunday; and at a dinner table. But, it was not the less serious, for that—and I have come to repeat it. I am not rich; but your drafts, to that amount, shall be honoured.” Are not these things worthy of record, dear Stafford? Should they ever be forgotten? It is to such men—the noble of heart—the free and frank—that a country is indebted, for its reputation. Theirs is the truest munificence. It is the opulence of the heart. There is another fact, in the history of this artist, that you could not listen to; you, who are so romantick and sublimated, in your conceptions of virtue and self-denial, without locking your hands, and gasping for breath;— vol. ii. L 2 but I am not at liberty to relate it—and I can only say, that it was a deed of his own, and one of the most heroick, unostentatious, and truly noble acts, that I have ever heard of. That, alone, were enough to establish the character of the man, forever, in my estimation. Let us now look in upon Mr. Trumbull. You have seen his Sortie of Gibraltar; and nothing that I could say of it now, would be of any avail, to elevate it in your opinion. It is his best picture. Indeed, his Death of Montgomery; Battle of Lexington; Bunker Hill, and all of his late pictures, are, altogether, not worth so much as that—so vigorous, and so full of action, as it is. His Declaration of Independence, is a plain, substantial affair, with an aspect of inveterate reality about it; but exhibiting not one feature of sublimity, or grandeur. The countenances are strong and varied;— but the awful gravity of wisdom and legislation; the moment of tremendous passiveness, when the travail is all over; and the thought of liberty has become a Declararation of Independence—that is not to be found in the picture. There is no passion—no majesty---no emotion; and no especial seriousness, except in the sculptured face of Samuel Adams; not so much, as you will see at any long dinner table, when the dishes are all uncovered, at once. You stand before it, without any feeling of awe or delight. You see the interiour of an old-fashioned apartment, with the light coming through the windows behind---and a number of figures, seated and standing, like men that think it about time to break up, and go home to a comfortable bed. I wish, heartily, that I could say something in favour of the picture; but I cannot---it does not deserve it. It is only a collection of strongly painted portraits; assembled together, without any common feeling or expression; but, as if by accident, and just as well behaved-men may come together, any where, without design. The next is the Surrender of Cornwallis. On the right of the picture, running off to a point, is a litter of American troops; and, on the left, diminishing in the same way, as if to make the perspective correspond, is another litter of Frenchmen. They are all of a family. All of his strong men, are strong with the same expression. You are struck with a strange family likeness in the whole. The first four or five faces, seem to be brothers, at least, if not different views of the same head. In the centre, is general Lincoln, mounted on a beautiful white horse, sitting to receive the sword, that a British officer, general O'Hara, surrenders. The common notion is, that Washington, himself, received the sword from the hands of Cornwallis. But neither Washton nor Cornwallis, was on the ground. General Lincoln was appointed to receive it, in the name of Washington, from the representative of Lincoln's haughty conquerour, Cornwallis; for, not long before, the latter had meted to the brave Lincoln, a full measure of unsparing and bitter humiliation, at the south; and this was the hour of retribution. The first thing that strikes the eye, forcibly, is this— the unpleasant continuity of the lines; and the amazing variety of attitudes, into which Mr. Trumbull has thrown his horses' heads. One has a nose in the air— the next, his a little lower—and the third, a little lower yet—while a fourth, is biting his own knee, with his leg advanced, and held, as if he had the cramp. This was done, undoubtedly, to break the line; and to give more action to the picture; but the design is too evident. We see the art—it does not deceive us for a moment. Here and there, too, are sundry ricketty and ill-formed horses, that, as I live, Stafford, reminded me of nothing, except the wooden cuts, in Geoffry Gambado's lessons for grown horsemen. There is not one good horse in the picture, except that in the centre; and his left fore hoof, is so turned in, upon a spot in the canvass, of the same colour, that it looks deformed and almost pointed; but the heads of the horses are admirable. A singular defect—one that will make you smile, is apparent in all—they are all too low in the shoulder; their fore-legs are too short, in almost every case. His Surrender of Burgoyne, I lately saw. As I live, Stafford, I begin to be ashamed of my countryman. When I look at these three national pictures, for which Congress have paid twenty-four thousand dollars; and think of their being shown in the capitol, at Washington, I could almost weep with shame and vexation. They are, altogether, a reproach to the country; and—I say it deliberately, Stafford—were I in congress, I would move for their being set fire to, before the great front of the building, which they help to make ridiculous. I cannot trust myself to speak of this last picture, as I feel. It is execrable. The heads are too big for the bodies. There is neither dignity nor character in it. It looks like bad tapestry, where a patch-work landscape is made up of fragments, picked out of different pieces; where the heads, cut out of old pictures, are pasted to bodies— and the bodies grouped by different people, each with a design of his own. Col. Morgan, the rifleman, looks like a target; and a captain from Connecticut, mounted, for the purpose of showing his profile, has been made to break his own neck; and general Burgoyne is tilting over upon his nose.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Thursday.— I have now done with Mr. Trumbull, lamenting that a man of such strength, when young, should be, in his dotage, or, if not in his dotage, that he should be contented with such labour. There are now some other pictures, particularly of Mr. Alston, Leslie, and Morse, of which, were I a little better acquainted with them, I would speak at large. They were all pupils of Mr. West; or, at least, students in the Royal Academy; and all, I believe, have carried off some prizes. Mr. Morse, I know, had one; and would have obtained another, had he remained in the country, with his picture; for the rules of the society required that. But he could not. The subject had been given out to sixteen pupils—and he could not feel very certain of the gold medal, whatever were the merit of his picture; and, beside that, his father had been pressing him, with great earnestness, and for a long time, to return home;—he did return, leaving his picture, which Mr. West, himself, afterward wrote to him, would have obtained the prize, had he remained. Mr. West has always shown himself warmly disposed toward his young countrymen; and all of them speak of him, with affection and reverence. He it was, that influenced Mr. Sully to abandon copying; and to begin manufacturing for himself, while he was literally working, and starving himself to death, in London for some of his American patrons. Was he not right? A man might as well hope to learn how to make a poem, by copying poems, as a picture, by copying pictures. Mr. Morse's prize was obtained for the Dying Hercules. I have never seen it; but I have heard it spoken of, as a bold and excellent piece of naked anatomy—but with too much convulsion in the sinews and flesh, even for Hercules. It was first modelled in clay, by Mr. Morse;—nay, I believe that it was for that model, and not for the painting, that he received the medal. But his style is beautiful and warm; strong, rich, and fanciful. His portraits, such as I have seen, were small, and hastily done up; but they were excellent:—and one, making a large picture, with some broken architecture, I have dwelt upon, with great pleasure, again and again. It was the portrait of a young girl of South Carolina, where Mr. Morse has now gone to reside. I have seen but two of Mr. Leslie's pictures—and only one or two of Mr. Alston's; and that so long since, and so hurriedly, that I have not the heart to speak of them.[8] [8] It was of Mr. Alston, that the affecting, simple little aneedote is told by Mr. Irving, in one of his loose papers, published in the New Monthly, under the title of “Recollections of a Student.” He was the “American painter,” whose dear companion had “left him;” whose own wife had abandoned him, in a land of stranger, and gone alone into the sky—leaving him alone, upon the earth, unsustained, weary, and heart-sick, to waste his continual inspiration upon the darkness and emptiness of the world about him. Ah! who would not have felt that “she had left him,” had the spirit of him (for the young wife of a young man— a man of genius and feeling—is nothing else but the spirit of him) put out her bright wings, all at once, without preparation, while they were journeying together, side by side—shook off the dust of the earth—and shot upward—just as if she had been his guardian angel, only for a little time; and had grown weary of her humanity. Who would not complain that she had left him? Better to have been alone for ever,—than after such a companionship!—Ed. Mr. Alston stands in the very front rank of his profession; and Mr. Leslie, when he first came out, was considered a marvel, and a prodigy. He had made a series of beautiful, and singularly spirited sketches of Cooper and Cooke, the actors; in which, the likeness and character of the men, were preserved with astonishing truth. The people were mad about it; and he was sent abroad, to become—a finished miracle. The result is, just what might have been expected. He has ceased to astonish; and, do what he will, he never can astonish again, unless he shall first become contemptible. He has a fine genius; and may become great, in the romantick and pleasant departments of the art; but I doubt much, notwithstanding all that has been said about him, whether he have any peculiarity of genius for great painting. All of his fmaily are addicted to it—and nothing is easier than to deceive one's self, on such a subject. A child, of any sensibility, is perpetually shifting in its movement. Today, he is flying kites—to-morrow, chalking out men and women, or horses, upon the fence—the next day, whittling with his pen-knife—making houses of blocks —and boats of chips—and so on, forever—until some day, he is brought to manifest a decided preference for some one of these amusements. If he should chance to sing, then his parents recal the shrieking and squalling of his infancy, as so many indications of his genius for musick—if he turn to drawing, it is the same. All the old books and papers of the household, that have been accumulating for years, are ransacked for the vestiges of this surprising talent, when it was first struggling into existence, and trying its wing. So, with all others. Be he “painter, poet, auctioneer”—when a man, if he be distinguished as either, there will be enough to remember that he was so, in his boyhood. Another fact.—A parent is fond of musick—he naturally desires to have his child fond of it, too. The child squalls—much as other children squall—but the father finds a particular expression, tone, or meaning in it.— The babe grows older; and the gamut is put into its little hands—every sound is watched, commented on, encouraged or reproached—he hears nothing praised, but musick—nothing spoken of, but musicians. It is the standard and touchstone of merit and virtue, for all men. The child learns to ask, when he sees a stranger—not, whether he be wise or good—but, on what instrument he plays?—not, whether he have a good heart—but, whether he have a good ear?—not whether he talk well—but, whether he sing well?—and to regard an affirmative, as sufficient to authorize any intimacy—a negative, as a brand of vulgarity and insensibility. What wonder, if the child become a musician, too?—and what wonder that people say, that a gift for musick runs in this family; and some other gift, in that? What nonsense! The child is named, perhaps, after some musician or painter. What wonder if it be taught to revere and imitate its namesake? I certainly have wandered, wide and far, dear Stafford; but I am determined not to leave the subject now, until it is exhausted. One little anecdote, I would not omit, however, while speaking of Mr. Alston. He is an amiable man, of indefatigable labour; and a fine genius, rather than a bold one. He is chaste and fine, but timid. This may be seen as well in his poetry, as in his painting. There is an artificial heat in both. He wants passion; and even true greatness;—for there is too little evil in his heart to help him in the generation of Greatness—a spirit that is, always, of a troubled countenance, and appalling expression, even in her repose. Yet, like all other men, Mr. Alston is most anxious to appear what he is not.— He would be thought a genius, and nothing but a genius; a creature that can people the blank canvass with a burning vision, even while the smoke is passing before him, and he can see nothing but the bright eyes and loose hair thereof;—for this purpose, he will toil all night long, in secrecy and loneliness;—and then, lie abed all day; or, till dinner time, with an affectation of carelessness and indolence, that is very amusing. He wishes it to be thought, that the labour, which is apparent in every touch of the pencil, is the rapid handling of one, agitated and thrilling with his subject! You have heard of Mr. Peale; and you asked me, some time ago, particularly, about his Court of Death, and if he were not once in London, with the Mammoth. I am now at leisure to answer you. I have enquired, and found that he is the same man, who was in London; and the reason of his going, is so creditable to his character, as an artist, that you ought to know it. Mr. Peale is of a family, who are all addicted to painting, from their cradles. In the honest enthusiasm of their hearts, they have been, for a long time, in the habit of naming their children, male and female, after certain eminent painters. Thus, this Mr. Peale, is named Rembrandt; and, when in Paris, was called the American Rembrandt, though his style has nothing of the sublime vulgarity, or depth of Rembrandt; and he has brothers named Titian, Rubens, Raphael,[9] [9] RAPHAEL PEALE—admirable still-life painter.—Ed. Linnaeus, and Franklin; and sundry relations, with equally significant and unlucky names. It is a pity; for it almost always forces the mind to institute some comparison—and the result is usually discouraging. This gentleman, it appears, was a portrait painter; and, at a very early age, executed some portraits of singular merit. At length, after being married, and having some children, he determined to go abroad, and study the art, in its birth-place and home—under the skies of Europe. He returned, discouraged and dismayed; and had almost resolved to abandon it, forever, and turn his attention to agriculture. But the spirit that God had kindled within him, was not to be so soon extinguished;— nor ever, but by the hand that had kindled it. His family had augmented—it was no light matter to venture abroad, and leave them—and to carry them with him, was perilous in the extreme. What would they do, helpless and alone, in a land of strangers, were he to be taken from them? Yet, disheartening as the thought was, it did not intimidate him. The unappeasable spirit would not be quieted within him;—he was haunted, day and night, by the magnificent spectres of genius. He went, again, with his whole family;—he painted a picture, and exhibited it to the French people; and he was warmly encouraged. The darkness vanished—the sun shone out upon him—the mystery and wonder of the art were laid open before him. He felt a new feeling— one of inconceivable determination and strength, arising within him. David and Gerard came to see him—some senators sat to him. He studied the face of Napoleon; and obtained a better likeness, as David, himself, acknowledged, of the lower part, than had ever been painted of him. He returned to Philadelphia; and, to convince the people that he had learnt something abroad, he painted Napoleon on horseback—a distinct, single, and vigorous picture, with a sublimity in the countenance of Napoleon, that I never saw excelled—it is absolutely articulate and preternatural. It is the greatest of his workmanship. He then—for the Philadelphians were still in doubt; and some said that he had borrowed the horse, and the rider, too, from David's Napoleon passing the Alps—a picture like this in no particular whatever—a daring and tumultuous affair—where a heavy banner is breaking, like a thunder-cloud, over the head of Napoleon:—He then copied Mr. West's Lear. It was a pity. Yet he made a better picture than the original; tempering its exaggeration, and qualifying its perverseness;—but it was only a copy. The original is now destroyed, I believe. Still there was nobody to cry, God speed! to him, even in his native city. Stafford, why is this?—Is it the nature of man to overlook whatever is near and familiar to him—to court whatever is rare, and of difficult attainment? Why are strangers met, as they are, with incense and wine, while our own children are languishing?—Yet, so it is—a new face, like a new planet, is apt to make us forget the old ones. Thus, Mr. Alston, who is from the south, goes to the north, for sustenance; and Mr. Morse, who was born at the north, goes to the south. Thus, too, if girls want to be married, they must go, no matter how amiable and excellent they are, where they are not known;—where people are not familiar with their loveliness. How many a young man, unknown and unhonoured at home, is found, steadily and proudly, among the great, when he is abroad, and dependent only upon his own merit. Excuse vol. ii. M the digression, dear Stafford—there was an indignant feeling at my heart, and I thought it safest to give it vent, when I reflected on the miserably reluctant spirit, with which we award to them that we have known, the encouragement of genius. Why is it?—Are we unwilling to be beaten in the race, by them that learnt their alphabets out of the same book with ourselves; trundled hoops; and flew kites, just exactly as we did?— Yes—it is.—If we be beaten by strangers; eclipsed by the unknown, we conceal our mortification, under the pretence that, they were born with some peculiar faculty, which we wanted. But, we cannot lull our shame with this unction, when we have known our conquerors, from the cradle; and know that they have beaten us, not by any inherent power, peculiar to themselves, but by their industry, and perseverence. This, I believe, is the secret. But, to return.— The next picture that Mr. Peale painted, was the Roman Daughter; or, as Murphy calls it, in his tragedy, the Grecian Daughter. No subject is more common; but, it was never painted so well.—A woman, full of tenderness, in the deep breathing of the heart, is nourishing her own father, with her own beauty. The hand of the old man is wrong—it is badly placed, isolated— and produces a bad effect; but I know of no other fault in the picture. When it appeared, a gentleman in Philadelphia, who had travelled, “and sure he ought to know”—pronounced it a copy—Mr. Peale waited on him, in company with a friend; and asked him where he had seen the original. The gentleman found some difficulty; though he was exceedingly positive, that he had seen it, somewhere—in telling where: and, at last, named the collection of Mr. Gerard—of Paris. “Of Mr. Gerard!” said Mr. Peale—in astonishment. He was the mildest man in the world; and remarkable, for his politeness, good temper and self-possession; but, that was quite too much, for either, at the moment. He entreated to know the room—and the stranger, finding that Mr. Peale knew more about Mr. Gerard, than he did—finally abandoned his position, though reluctantly, and qualified his charge, so as to make it stand thus:— that he had seen something, somewhere, somewhat like it. But, the evil had gone abroad. The picture was warmly spoken of—but, forever, as a copy. Mr. Peale came out, therefore, and offered it, in the publick news papers, to anybody, who would establish the fact, that it was a copy. After that, he made a copy, which, I am told, is altogether better than the orginal. Next, he painted his Dream of Love; or, as he called it at first, his Jupiter and Io. Originally, the face of Jupiter was pressed to hers—and no other part of his body could be seen, through the smoke and cloud that enveloped them. It had a bad effect—the Thunderer's face ought not to have been seen;—and never, at such a moment, in such an occupation. The God, even in his repose, is not easily created—but, when his forehead is quaking, and the strong lustre of his eye, is a consuming fire, before which, the heart melts, and the spirit faints, it were madness to think of representing it. This head was afterward blotted out; and a naked Cupid, painted over the face of Io. The whole is now passionately, but purely beautiful; the flesh lively, firm, and natural— with that soft and inviting elasticity, which makes the lips thrill, in looking at it. In short, it is the best naked woman that I ever saw—and, by far, the most chaste. You feel no impure emotion—nothing but an innocent delight, as you stand breathing over her, as if it were the picture of your own sweet sister—asleep, in her timidity and loveliness. His next attempt was the Ascent of Elijah.—It is not yet finished; but the conception, which is after Lutherberg, is imperial; the revolution of the clouds—their fiery crimson; and the vivid brightness of the brazen chariot, are transcendent. I hope to see it finished—to see the descending mantle, distinguished from the clouds —the whirlwind of fire and dust, more evident—the horses' heads, that stand opposite, like two rose leaves, upon one stem, in some girl's drawing, corrected—when it will be the most vehement and poetical of his paintings. To this, succeeded the Court of Death—of which I shall not attempt a description; for the papers that I have sent you, are full of it. Yet, you ought to know something of the difficulty to be undergone in this country, by an artist, who undertakes such a work. Here, he has no academies; no collections; no other painters to consult—if exhausted, he must refresh himself as he can. He has no academy figures—no people trained, to stand and sit as he requires—no workers in plaster, if he want a hand made permanently, for some particular study. And what is yet worse, nobody, whom he can prevail upon to sit. So that his men and women, are, nine times out of ten, even in their anatomy, the literal creation of his own brain. This is one of the largest pictures in the world.—The figures, are full eight feet high, (I suppose)—and are in three groups; illuminated by torch-light, day light, and reflected light. The chief fault is, that, there is too much abstractedness in the conception of the painter. He is not satisfied with Pestilence, Famine, and Conflagration—he must have something like them—but not the same. Thus, instead of Pestilence,—he affects to embody the apprehension of Pestilence. This is the very metaphysicks of painting. Another serious fault is, that there is too little foreground to the canvass: the figures are too much in a line; and, on the side where Death exerts most power, the least effect is produced. On one side, his hand is raised, and men are dying by disease. On the other, his hand is in repose; and War, Pestilence, Famine and Conflagration leap forth, like demons, commissioned on the spot, to lay waste and destroy. A part of the conception is magnificent. Mr. Peale has uprisen, among the wrecks of the nursery, and dared to array Death, in the calm, awful, unrelenting attributes of Philosophy. We see nothing of the raw head and blood bones; nor the eyeless sockets, hour-glass and scythe of Christian mythology. He disdains to follow the vulgar notions of allegory. But Death is the principal figure. And yet, it is not readily perceived. The eye is first attracted by a corpse —a dead man, washed up, as it were, by the wind and water, to the feet of Death. His countenance is wonderful—but the flesh is too warm; he is arrayed in dazzling white---and you see too little of the presiding power. There is not depth enough to the piece---and there should have been clouds, and darkness, and fire, it may be, about the picture of Death---and through the broken roof, the blue lightnings, or, at least, the starry lustre of a midnight sky should have streamed; but, instead of this, instead of rocks, shattered and piled up, there is a great curtain, heavy and grand, to be sure, hanging down from—we are left to imagine what.— Yet, the picture is a great one---the greatest that I have ever seen---and a most extraordinary performance, when we reflect on the discouragement that the artist had experienced---his want of opportunity---and that it was a first attempt at dramatizing on a large scale. It is no easy matter to put many persons in agitation---even to him, that has been accustomed to manage a few. The difference is, that of training a large army and a small one. We have now come to Mr. Vanderlyn---and I must tell you something about him, too. It will assist you in remembering him, and his worth. When Aaron Burr was in his zenith, he happened to be travelling, somewhere in the western parts of New York; and stopping, one day, at a tavern, he saw what he took to be, a line engraving, of uncommon vigour. He spoke of it to the landlord; and was not a little amazed, when the latter told him that it was a drawing, made with a pen, by a stupid boy of his; an apprentice to the blacksmith's trade, of whom he feared that he should never be able to make anything. Burr sent for the boy, and was so pleased with him, that he tried to obtain him---but the master, suspected some secret value, in his stupid apprentice, and would not part with him, at last, on any terms. “Put a shirt into your pocket,” said Col. Burr, in passing the boy; “come to New York, when you can get a vol. ii. M 2 chance, and ask for Aaron Burr---he will take care of you.” Some time had passed, and Col. Burr had forgotten the incident; when, one morning, in came a strange-looking boy, while he was sitting at breakfast; and, as he approached, plucked out a bundle from his pocket, and gave it to him. The colonel was not a little amused to find it a shirt. Here began the acquaintance; and here, the eminence of Vanderlyn; and heaven so ordered it, that, when colonel Burr, the Julius Cæsar of our country—the greatest evil spirit of his age—was in the wane, Vanderlyn, who had just left Paris, warm with favour, and rich with all that makes life comfortable, encountered him, in his desolation; and, in his turn, ministered to the necessities of his benefactor. Such is the anecdote, as I have heard it; and such, I believe, is the truth, in all the material facts. The only two pictures of Vanderlyn, that I have seen, are his Marius, sitting amid the Ruins of Carthage; and his Ariande, deserted by Theseus. The former obtained a medal from the national academy, in France. It is a stern, strange, natural picture; with a finish of unexampled perfection. The figure is larger than life, sitting like a giant, intruded upon by some vision of conquest and rebellion. There is nothing visionary, nothing intellectual, about Marius. All is the barren and bleak expression of the tyrant man, when his heart is iron, and his nature hardened in blood. It is a great picture—but too elaborately finished. His Ariadne is very beautiful; but you feel no emotion, no trembling, when you approach her. You do not feel that slight, tremulous quivering of the heart, which you ought to feel, when trespassing upon the sleep of even a pictured woman—in her innocence, timidity, and loveliness. O, I had well nigh forgotten a picture that has just been sent out to the Cathedral, in Baltimore, by Louis of France. It is the Descent from the Cross; full of the fine errour, and beautiful exaggeration of the French school; yet, animate with a profound and daring spirit, that startles and amazes you. There are eight or ten figures—two of which have no business, at all, in the piece; and are put in—one to fill up a blank in the canvass, on the right, where he stands staring at you, like an Indian statue—and the other, to display the power of the artist, in tinging the drapery with an undulating ridge of rich velvet light. This latter is on the left; and no human being could remain in the situation, in which he is placed, for a single moment; nay, it would be difficult for one to sit so, long; and there is nothing to be seen to justify us in believing that he does sit. He appears about to manifest his adoration. The artist is fine in his feet; and, therefore, he has crowded the whole picture with feet. A red outline, he has discovered, at some time, to have the effect of illumination upon deep colouring; and, therefore he has lined the very lips and eyes; the tees and fingers, of all, or most of the figures, with a red outline. The sheet, too, upon which the Saviour is lying, is not linen—no, nor woollen—but wet paper;—and was, evidently, copied from wet paper, or badly imagined; for it is saturate and heavy, with water, in almost every fold. The artist, too, is fond of shadow; the dark, clayey-coloured shadow, too, of death and terrour; and, therefore, has he been lavish of it, to such an extent as to appal the imagination. He is fond of brightening his drapery; and his purple is transparent and liquid, like flowing claret; unnaturally bright and vivid. These are all the faults; and they are rather the faults of the French school, than of the artist. He is truly a sublime and original genius. The anatomy of the Saviour, who is about nine feet long, is wonderfully fine—the countenance great—and that of his mother, terrible. The evening sky is preternaturally lighted; and the rough cross stands up against it, with a bold and decided effect, with a sheet floating from the top, as out of the sky. To it, clings a woman, half frantick in her grief and terrour, with her black drapery flying in the wind—and resembling a shattered and torn banner, against a blazing sky. By her side, is a beautiful creature—a woman, turbaned and queen-like—standing, as if death-struck, at the instant that you look upon her. Her eyes!—by heaven, they have not yet ceased to move! Look upon them—the lustre gushes out; and the delusion is so wonderful, that, after gazing upon the face for a moment, in a certain point of view, about five or six yards from it, it no longer appears cadaverous and unnatural, in its unearthly hue; but, like some beautiful creature, at her worship, over whose head the skies have just passed away, while the tears are loading her uplifted lashes. It is the most wonderful head, except one, that ever I saw in my life—wonderful for its simplicity, beauty—and yet more wonderful for its effect. But, look at the drapery upon her breast—what keeps that purple mantle there?—the wind? No—for the wind blows in another direction;—nay, the wind is faint, as you may perceive by her turban, which is of a lighter material. Is it her action? No—for her action would throw it off. Yet it clings to her bosom, (which is too broad,) as if kept there by a strong wind. Observe her hands—they are perfect. Another beautiful effect is produced—perhaps without intention. We see, from the very colour of the sky, beyond the ground, that all these figures are on a hill.— How this is apparent, it would be difficult to tell—yet, so it is. Perhaps it is, that there is, always, a peculiar colour near the horizon; but, however that may be—excuse me for a moment—we have every day experience, that there are ideas existing in our minds, without our consciousness of them;—nay, that even when we are made conscious of them, ideas that we have no language to express, notwithstanding the doctrine that men think in words—and that they can have no idea, without a correspondent word to express it. Thus we are shown a profile—a mere outline, and we immediately recal the original. But how?—that we cannot tell. We look into a camera obscura; we see shadows walking about; yet every one, we are able to recognise, with certainty, afar off. How, we cannot tell. Nay, to come nearer home. Can any of us tell how he distinguishes the gait, voice, carriage, or tread, of any particular person, amid a thousand. He can do it. We see that. Yet, he has no idea how he does it; or, if he have, he has no words to express it in; for, he may be able to perceive the difference, without being able to describe it; or, to make another conceive of it, though he should talk till dooms-day. Nay, how know we the hand-writing of our friends?—and how should we be able to explain to another, who had never seen writing, wherein the secret lay. Again, there is a certain air of reality about the truth; and of constraint and awkwardness about what is counterfeit; and there are men, who can tell you, at a glance, whether a signature be genuine or not, although they never saw any thing like it, before. This is incredible, and they could never make it intelligible to us. They feel the difference—they judge by it —they trust to it; but they cannot define it. Yet the incredulous, no matter who they are, have always some experience of their own, if they would but reflect, to confirm the fact. Have they never been able to tell, at once, a manner that was affected?—to point out what was natural, and what was not, even in the voice, and look, and manner of sitting, in a person whom they had never seen before? Nay, have not all of us, at some time, detected an impostor, a pretender, whom we had encountered for the first time?—solely by that indefinable, strange, but convincing manner, which will betray the counterfeit. Is this instinct? I know not. But I know, to return for a single moment to the subject, that we are often struck with things upon the stage, in books, or paintings, unexpectedly natural—yet uncommon—at which we all wonder—asking ourselves why it has never been seen before—and astonished that we should ever have observed it sufficiently to see the resemblance. So it is—the minds of all, the most careless and inattentive, are stored with resemblances; and they awake, whenever they feel the thrill of affinity; leaving people surprised at their own memory and observation, and delighted at, they know not what. Something truly natural—that they thought overlooked by all the world. So here, we are amazed at finding in ourselves, a secret consciousness of what is natural, in this part of the picture. Yours, ED. MOLTON.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SPENCER RANDOLPH TO SARAH RAMSAY. Boston, —. You have not returned my letter, Miss Ramsay; you have dared to read and retain it, notwithstanding my presumption. I expected this, I confess; but still, so much depended upon it—so much, that you, yourself, are ignorant of, that I trembled for you. I cannot explain myself, in this letter; and, it is highly probable, that you may never receive another;—but be assured that your nobleness and generosity on this occasion, the most trying of your life, have literally saved you from destruction. You are amazed. You do not believe me—yet, as true is it, thou excellent and strong minded woman, as that I have meditated evil against thee, and relented. But what evil? Lady, I cannot tell thee; I may never be able to tell thee; but my heart quakes at this moment, and there is a scorching heat about it—and a sensation, as if all its blood were filtering through it, drop by drop, when I reflect on what thou hast escaped. Farewell! heaven bless you!—heaven, in its mercy and compassion, bless and sustain you, dear Miss Ramsay. Does it offend you? Are you not dear to me? Have you not been so; and have you not known it too, for a long time? You have; then why should you affect any resentment at seeing the word inadvertently written, which you have read, again and again, in my eyes;—and, which—pardon me, dear woman,—which I have seen, legible engraved, in the very apple of yours. Farewell—yet, before we part, as a memento of my sincerity and affection for you, I pray you to listen to my admonition; and let it sink into your heart. You are imprudent—haughty—and too independent. Had you been less so—I should never have succeeded as I have, with you. It was on your excess of these qualities, strangely disguised, to be sure, but not so completely, but that my eye detected them, in our first conversation, that I grounded my hope. Do you know, what that hope was?—it was to destroy you. Do you smile? Remember how far I have gone—how completely you have been in my power—and then tell me, proud woman, what saved you? Was it your own strength? No—was it that I had no opportunity, or did I want power? Ask yourself—remember where we have been, and how; alone, hour after hour; and then attribute your safety to its true cause—my forbearance. You once desired to know who I was. I told you—but you were not satisfied. I saw it; I saw by the colour of your eyes, and the heaving of your bosom, that you were not; but you dared not risk another question. It is now time that I should tell you—and—but no, Miss Ramsay, that may not be at present. At some future hour, perhaps, when we least expect it, you shall know the truth. In the mean time, remember my words. Be more guarded in future;—stifle the tenderness that you feel for me; and pardon me, I beseech you, for the evil that I have meditated against you; and the evil that I have done you, in awaking your great heart, not to disquiet it forever, but to prevent it, from ever sleeping again, in consideration of my forbearance and sincerity. Are you offended? You are. Do you believe that you have been in such danger? You do not. Yet, I—I who know woman, and know how to assail her, under every temper and similitude, I can assure you, that you have been so completely in my power, though you know it not, that I could have destroyed you, utterly, if I would. Reflect for yourself. Has not the time been, when, no human being could have persuaded you that the hour would come, when you could sit by any man, as you have set by me?—when you could feel your heart swell to bursting, if he laid his hand upon yours—and when— but no matter. What you have experienced, will be a lesson; a bitter one, I confess, but one that you will never forget. Can you forgive me, Sarah? No—for a while, you cannot—will not; but, one day or other, you will.— I am sure of it. You need not return this letter. I shall never receive it, if you do; for, to-morrow I am going to New-York on business; and I know not how much further, nor how soon, I may return. You are fond of poetry, I believe—I enclose you a piece written by a Mr. Molton, sometime ago. By the way, that man, of whom I once heard you speak, in a manner that disturbed me exceedingly, was named Molton, was it not? Do you know his first name? Was it Edward? If it was, I anticipate your pleasure in receiving the hymn, on the opposite page; for that was written by a man named Edward Molton, some time ago. I have heard a good deal of him here; and not a little that would have alarmed me once, although I remember that your eyes flashed fire, when you spoke of him; and your lip writhed with bitterness and scorn— and hatred—and terrour too, I thought. How was it Miss Ramsay?—and who was he? I ask you, somewhat confidently; not because I look for any answer; but, merely to show you that I have read your heart, even in its concealment. Have you not loved Molton? You have —I am sure of it. He lives at the south—at New-York perhaps?—or at Philadelphia? If so, I shall probably meet with him; and, if there be such a man upon this earth, it shall be my business to become acquainted with him—though you and I, Miss Ramsay, should never meet again. They tell a story here of him—to this effect—that he stole upon the innocent heart of a lovely young creature here, who became in time, passionately fond of him. They say that she was a woman of extraordinary genius—that her talents were of the highest order, —that she was timid, gentle; and yet, so full of heroick principle, that—gracious God!—can there be such a woman upon this earth!—when he grew weary of her, he had only to acknowledge some unworthiness of his past life—some dark secret of his early days—and, much as she loved him—though her heart-strings were interwoven with his—though she felt, as if the same blood circulated in the veins of both—and their vessels and arteries, intertwined and communicated with each other--- yet---yet!---she tore them all away at once---ruptured them all—and lay down, alone, smiling in her tears, and bled to death. Is it true, Sarah? Have you ever heard of it? But let me give you the poetry, of this Mr. Molton. What think you of it? I am told that he wrote a good deal, in his early days; and then, deliberately abandoned it; and that this, with one or two other little pieces that I have, were the last of his productions. But can this be the same man? Would your Molton have written a hymn? He might; for this one, it is said, had little of what the world calls religion, in him; and cared more for poetry than doctrine, on such occasions. Perhaps he was like him, who said—“Je crois de la religion tout ceque j'en puis comprendre—et respect le reste, sans le rejetter.” Hymn for the Lord's Supper. Crucifixion. His hour had come!—and darkness rolled, At once—o'er all the unclouded skies! Temples were rent—and dead men told Their secrets and their mysteries! His hour had come!—the hour of death, And lo! the man of sorrow bow'd In meekness down;—gave up his breath, And blessed the red, blaspheming crowd! His hour had come!—and forth, there strode Ten thousand clouded Cherubim And hung beneath their blue abode, On countless wings, to welcome him! Archangels rode the wind!—and through You vault, that rolls away in air, That sky of everlasting blue, They bore the bleeding spirit, where, Upon his judgment seat, with crown Of glittering thorn, he sits, to bless The tears of all, that, kneeling down Weep at this hour of tenderness. vol. ii. N Once more, Sarah, farewell!—remember me, as one that hath repented of the wrong done to you---and atoned for it, to the utmost of his power; and ready to atone for it, with his blood. SPENCER RANDOLPH.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SARAH TO JULIET. I am ill, dear Juliet, quite ill, and have been so, for several days, or I should have written to you before. I thank you for your cruel letter. It had the effect of alarming me into a sense of my danger; and I know not what else might, so deep and wonderful was my infatuation— was, do I say? It is—even to this hour, it is— although I am now fully awake, to the danger that I have escaped—and to the character of the man; and to his design. Ask me not how I have learnt this. I cannot yet bring myself to tell thee. I can only say, dear Juliet, that,—ah, I cannot speak it, for shame and sorrow— no matter—no matter, Juliet--Randolph might have been dear to me, in time. But that time is past. We shall never meet again, except by some accident, which is not likely to happen. He is a bad man, I fear;—or, at least that he has been, I have no doubt. But do not alarm yourself about him more.—I have been imprudent—I feel that I have. I feel my own weakness. It has taught me compassion for the weakness of others. And I do believe, Juliet, that I shall never speak, scornfully, of any human being again—of any woman, I mean;—for I now begin to understand something of that tremendous spell, with which the destroyer approaches them.— I awake and wonder at myself. It seems impossible that what I have experienced, hazarded, felt, is not a dream?—I ask myself, again and again, if my nature be altered—if I be the same woman that I was?—And I cannot yet even understand the power, or the means, by which the alteration has been affected. Have I been asleep, all my life, asleep upon a precipice?—Have I been deceived so long, and so utterly, in the knowledge of myself? Thoughts that I should have derided and mocked at once, are now the perpetual residents of my bosom.—Dreams at which, I should have wept once—are common to me, now, night after night; and feelings, to which, I have been a stranger all my life; feelings, which I could not even understand in others—trances that were—that are a destroying fire to me. Nay, the deportment and accent of endearment and passion, which, to see another exhibit once, was enough to cover my forehead with blushes—and, make me faint at the heart, with compassion and shame—all these things have been familiar to Sarah Ramsay. O Juliet, I cannot proceed. Your letter is before me. My hand shakes; and a quick feverish sensation, like the breath of serpents is constantly passing over my lips.— Yet, I cannot withhold my counsel and prayer for thee. I think of thy situation, continually, dear. O do not, dear Juliet, do not despond. The peril is chiefly imaginary, depend upon it; and is abundantly aggravated by apprehension. Be firm and confident, and prepared---use a continual and gentle exercise; and, I am sure, that heaven will bless thee at last--thou wilt awake, dear, with the mouth of thy babe clinging to thine---and thy husband--- Nay, Juliet---thy husband will be away; but a better than he, a wiser, a surer help, even thy God, will be near to thee. Farewell!---I will write again, as soon as my sore, and mortified, and humbled heart, shall have the strength. Farewell, SARAH RAMSAY. P. S. The letter was dear to me; I confess it---and, when I have recovered, I shall tell thee all. I do not know who he is, or what, but I have a suspicion— which, I scarcely dare confess, even to myself, because, admitting him to be, what my foolish heart would imagine, his manner is still unaccountable—still mysterious and inexplicable. Farewell, once more—farewell. S. R.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SARAH RAMSAY TO SPENCER RANDOLPH. Randolph, I pity you. Would that I could despise you—but, though you deserve it, I cannot. You have called me haughty. Yet—you have humbled me to the dust. I am imprudent, you say?—In what?—That I have believed in, and trusted to you, as an honourable man?— You are right—Sarah Ramsay has been one of the haughtiest of women; one of the most insensible. Was this a reason for pursuing her, haunting her, breaking down her spirit to this—and desolating her heart—till she has not even the strength, to lift up her hand in supplication—nor enough even to resent the indignity of your approach. You have spoken plainly, very plainly, for a man to speak to a woman;—but I am not yet so utterly abandoned of heaven, as to believe you. No, Randolph—No! it is not true, that you could ever have destroyed me.--- It is not true, that you could have corrupted my heart.--- Wicked and treacherous as you were; insinuating and persuasive--vehement and terrible, as you were, at times, I should have resisted you, forever; and---the first hour that uncovered the blackness of your nature to me--- would have been liberty to mine.---True, I should have felt, what I now feel, an insupportable humiliation, at your unworthiness.---I should have shed many bitter tears; tears, that would have blistered the heart of any honest man;---but they would have been shed, less in sorrow for myself, than in shame for you. Why have I written to you?---for two reasons---Nay, for three. To convince you, that, humbled as I am, I have yet the power to say, firmly, farewell forever!--- To remind you of that scene, where you had well nigh betrayed your cruel purpose—when I awoke, for a moment---as if my limbs had been fettered by a serpent--- that should convince you, that you never would have prevailed---but---I cannot reason, I scorn to reason with you, on such a subject.-- A third motive, and the last, is this.---I have not returned your letter.---Nay, I am willing to own that I shall keep it, and that it will be dear to me, while I live, as something that reminds me of an escape, little less than miraculous;--but most of all, to command you---nay, to entreat of you---never to mention Edward Molton to me again---and never, if by any chance you should come in his way, never, if you have any respect, or any compassion for me, never to mention me to him. Farewell Randolph, farewell; you little know the heart which you have lost. Farewell, S. R.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">JOHN TO SARAH. Philadelphia— Mr. Grenville has just sailed; and, not an hour has past, since I parted with his wife, who had accompanied him to the vessel. Her spirits are very low; and, with reason, I think; for, if I may judge from the countenance of a man, the shadow of death is upon his. Juliet will never see him again. But, prepare yourself for something that will make the blood curdle about your heart. Sarah, I can scarce believe myself. Molton has been confined for some time; I have seen him occasionally; but, it is only within a few days that he has been out; and with whom, think you, he was first seen? With Grenville! the husband of Juliet!--- The whole town are talking of it; and when I saw him, this morning, shake Molton's hand, with all his heart and soul; and then take the hands of his own wife, before me, and place them in Molton's---and say, as he did, with a deep, broken, agitated voice—“my friend!---my friend!---do thou support her and comfort her.—To her God and to thee, do I commit her!” when I saw that, Sarah, what, think you, were my feelings? Juliet was unable to support it---the tears filled her eyes---and she would vol. ii. N 2 have fallen, had not Molton caught her; but, she shuddered at his touch, and immediately turned to me--- heaven bless her! with her eyes still shut. Molton smiled, haughtily; and, the next moment, we were on our way home. Not a word was spoken---and we left Juliet at the door. He turned, coldly, but expressively, and bade her farewell. There was something in his tone, or manner, that affected her; for I felt her hand tremble, and she pressed mine, convulsively. She looked at him---her lips moved---she inclined her head---but, she was unable to utter a word. His countenance fell; and he promised to call on her, tomorrow, with me. This was said, with a deliberate emphasis, as if to assure her, that he should not visit her alone. He then took a packet out of his bosom, directed to her, in the hand writing of her husband---with a note to this effect: “This is only to be opened, on the occurrence of one event---Mr. Molton will apprise my dear Juliet, what that event is.” Poor Juliet trembled, from head to foot; and Molton and I walked home to his house, where I was instantly struck, with the altered and strange appearance of Helen. I had not seen her, for a long time;---and now, there was a wildness and brightness in her eyes; a heated brilliancy in her cheeks, that alarmed me. I spoke to her, earnestly; and her voice—it seemed to come from her very heart —thrilled through and through me. I took her hand; it was wasted and hot; and, when I mentioned the name of Juliet, she opened her large dark eyes, and then shut them again, with such an expression of melancholy, that mine filled on the spot. She did not appear to observe it—and her hand trembled in mine, for a moment, before she withdrew it. Molton and I had then a long conversation together, on a variety of matters; such as religion, character, &amp;c. &amp;c.—and I discovered a new trait in his, which I never saw before—great vehemence in argument—and surpassing subtilty. The conversation was long; and would have been uninteresting to any one, who did not participate in it; but, nevertheless, as I have not written to you, for many a day, and as I am upon my favourite theme, Edward Molton, I will try to repeat some of his whimsical opinions, as nearly in his own manner and words, as possible. We spoke of pronunciation. He, it appears, is amazingly scrupulous on the subject—saying—“It matters not how a word is pronounced, so that all agree to pronounce it alike. We have no perfect standard of legitimate words or pronunciation; but, we have a pretty good one; and, to that, I am determined to conform. But all their lexicographers are wrong—Sheridan, Walker, and all. They give the sound of tchu, to the vowel u, in the words furniture, virtue, premature, &amp;c. They say that a child cannot give the pure sound to the u. But, I ask, why?—the reason is very simple; a child is taught to divide the words, thus: f-o-r, for;—t-u-n-e, tchune; v-i-r, vir, t-u-e, tchue;—and then, it is impossible, I admit, for his delicate organs to pronounce the u, properly. But divide the words, thus: virt-ue;—fortu-ne; pre-mat-ure;—and there is no difficulty then.” We next spoke of logick. I charged him with sophistry. He smiled. “No”—said he—“I am no longer a sophist. I have been one;—but, I am ashamed of the character.” “Pray,” said I, “will you give some notion of the changes that you have experienced in these matters? You often speak of what you have been;—by that, am I to understand that you are so, no longer.” “Always,” he replied. “I never so speak, unless I am altered. I do not say reformed, because it is a doubt with me, whether I am reformed. I but lay down one folly, to take up another.” “But where, and when, did you receive the first impulse to your strange and contradictory character?—In reasoning, for example.” “I can tell you where, distinctly, on that very point. When I was about I nineteen,happened to open a volume of Rees's Cyclopedia. And I came upon this proposition. I know not who was the author of it—but it was a great man; and my brain took fire in the contact —and a tremendous creature was generated in the smoke!—I heard the flames roar like the Atlantick—the noise, and shaking thereof, were like an earthquake.— You smile—but—I do not know what I am saying, dear Omar—my poor brain—pardon me.” (He had been quite delirious, poor fellow, for nearly a month)—“Well, the pain is over now. The proposition was this:—Men complain of God's severity:—they lay their hands upon his threatening and denunciation, and complain that he is unmerciful. Mistaken creatures! This very threatening is a proof of God's merciful and compassionate disposition. That startled me. But follow him. He reasons like a giant. “God does not threaten,” says he, “that man may sin, and so, be punished: But—that he may not sin, and so escape. Therefore, the higher the threatening runs, the greater is the mercy of God.” “I was angry. I understood nothing of logick,” continued Molton. “But, I did not know where to lay my hand, in my anger. I revolved, again and again, the proposition. I felt that it was unanswerable. And yet, I felt that it was a fallacy. I threw by my book,—I neglected my business. I thought of nothing else— dreamt of nothing else; and, at last, the light broke upon me. I tried the syllogism in my own way. It crumbled at my touch.” But how? said I—how was it? “By showing that it proved too much. For it might be applied to a human lawgiver; and the laws of Draco himself, could be defended by it. Nay—what penalty, though it were blood—blood!—for every transgression alike—what torture—what mode of death, might not thus be proved to be merciful; nay, to be merciful, exactly in proportion to its severity and terrour?” “God threatens. If we err, he will inflict the penalty. But we cannot live for a moment, without erring, in thought or word or deed. And, therefore, the mercy of God would be most conspicuous, should he threaten us with everlasting perdition for the slightest of our errours: If the proposition be true, it would be infinite mercy in Jehovah—should he punish us, forever and ever, for not living, as we cannot live—without errour.” “No—Omar. The doctrine is a fallacy—nay, worse, it is blasphemy. The mercy of God is shown by his proportioning the penalty to the offence—the denunciation, as exactly as possible, to the errour;—so that the temptation may be just outweighed, and no more, by the terrour of his displeasure, and the fear of offending one that loves us.” “Yes—Omar. And when the proposition is examined, coming as it does, from one of the greatest theologians of the age, it sinks to a level with this, which you have heard, I dare say, many a time. A cat has three tails. Nay—I do not wonder at your smile; yet it is as honest and as fair, to the full, as the proposition that I have just overthrown.” “Pray—how is it proved?” said I—“for I have never heard it.” “Thus—No cat has two tails. A cat has one tail more than no cat has. Ergo. A cat has three tails!” I laughed heartily—and who, that had never heard it before, would not have laughed; but not a muscle of his face stirred—not a limb shook. “That gave the first impulse to my character,” said he. I lay and wondered, in the deep midnight, at the strange power of reasoning. I saw, and began to revere it, for the first time, in contemplating that proposition. I devoted myself to the study; not as a science, for I never looked into a book; and, to this hour, I know nothing of the logick of the schools; not in disputation, for I never lifted my club, I never extended my shield, till I had made myself master of both, in my own way.— I came abroad then; and gave battle to all that I knew. I threw down my gauntlet, in the face of heaven and earth —and spoiled many a strong man of his harness, before I was weary of strife. I delighted in parodox. I wrapped myself up in sophistry;—and, if I went among men, it was with an encompassing darkness about me, that chilled and awed them, while it kept my faculties in everlasting shadow. I could not go beyond it. I began to doubt of every thing,—of every thing, but a God. But— it was not to be so, forever. I awoke—I rent the cloud that hung over me—are you superstitious?” “No!”—said I—somewhat startled—“no!”— “At my birth, sir, and for a week afterward, there was a cloud, scarcely larger than the wings of a great bird, which descended from the mountain, and hung over my father's dwelling, and rained upon it, night and day —so near to it, that you could have fired through it, with a rifle bullet—and there it staid. All the rest of heaven was bright. That same cloud hath hung over my mind, at times; and rained its reluctant, cold dews, upon my heart, from that hour to this.” His manner was very solemn and composed. I was troubled at it; but, whatever he had been, I am sure that, then he was in his senses. I next led the conversation to the Bible, of which I had heard that he had spoken irreverently. I was willing to know the truth. I asked him the question at once. “Yes—said I,—I have so spoken of the Bible. I am sorry for it. I wish that I had been better assured of its value. I had reasoned thus of it, and its doctrines. Either the Bible is necessary, or it is not. If it be not necessary, let us not disquiet ourselves about it. If it be—then is God unjust, for millions of millions have perished, are perishing, and will perish, without ever hearing of it. But God cannot be unjust, and therefore the Bible is not necessary. Nay, Omar, I went further. In the darkness and blindness of my nature, I dared to ask where lay the proofs of christianity. I had read Paley's Evidences. I had read and pitied Soame Jennyngs. Is not our Maker infinitely powerful? Infinitely wise? said I. Will not infinite wisdom and power always act by the simplest means?—And is it the simplest operation, for the Diety to put innumerable engines at work, and suffer that work to depend upon ten thousand contingencies—to effect the spreading of the gospel among all the nations of the earth?—when, by a single word, all—all!—from the creation of the world to the end thereof, would have become illuminated and converted.” “These were the thoughts of my proud and presumptuous nature, Omar; and this hour I should be down, quaking and shivering in agony, and remorse, for having had such thoughts, did I not feel that I was more to be pitied than blamed. I was mistaken, but honest.— And God, himself, will have compassion on the honest and mistaken.” “Soon after this, I met with Butler's Analogy. There was a man, whom I could listen to, with pride. He reasoned—he took nothing for granted—he went, with a severe and majestick simplicity, into the labaratory of the universe; into the very presence chamber of Jehovah; and there sat and expounded the tremendous mystery, which had darkened my understanding.” “Is God partial?” said he, “when he grants to one, what he denies to another? Yet where do you see two people, two nations—nay, two individuals, enjoying precisely the same advantages? One lives in a kinder climate—a more fruitful soil—is better fashioned—more highly gifted, intellectually and physically, than another. It cannot be denied that this is so. Then, is it consistent with his administration, to give the Bible to one, and deny it to another? Is it not of a piece with all his Providence?” “Again---God, by a word, could have peopled the world at once; covered it with a forest. But he chose a simpler process. He created one pair—he taught them to increase and multiply; he bade the forest to come gradually out of the earth.—Nay, is not all that he does, in the same harmonious measure, like one that pours out time, from the inexhaustible fountain of Eternity; and teaches his phenomena to appear and disappear, day after day, year after year, and century after century, with the same indifference.” “A God,” said I, interrupting him. “Who sees with equal eye, as God of all, “A hero perish, or a sparrow fall— “Atoms and systems into ruin horl'd, “And now a bubble burst, and now a world.” He fixed his eyes sternly upon me, as I repeated these lines. “Pshaw!—I am ashamed to hear you quote that—” said he. “Is it true?—No!—Did you ever reflect on it? Systems and atoms—bubbles and worlds, of the same value to God?—No!—It is little better than blasphemy, hardly to be forgiven in a poet. What!—are we no higher in the scale of being, than the beasts that perish? and is it a matter of equal indifference to our Maker, that one immortal soul is extinguished, an accountable spirit set free, in the whirl-wind of war—for it is there, that “heroes” fall—and that a sparrow hath perished. It were an argument for an Atheist. Never repeat it again, dear Omar, I intreat you.” Here, ended our conversation, for that time. Good night—dear Sarah. Yours, truly— JOHN.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">STAFFORD TO MOLTON. I thank you, my excellent friend, for your kind letter, of the —, and I hasten to reply to it, as briefly as possible. The vessesel is just about to sail, I find; and I must send you one word of acknowledgment, and thankfulness by her—though it be but one word; and answer you, when I have a little better opportunity. I should have written to you, many times before, but I have been expecting to see you; and, until I received this letler, I knew not where to address a line. You have gone, with your usual boldness, into the character of Byron, and the Unknown; but, I cannot agree with you, throughout; nor, would you wish me to. I know your temper too well, to believe that. I think your manner too, is too dictator-like; too arrogant and unqualified. But, I am anxious to hear more from you, on the subject; and, particularly, upon the character of your countrymen, and your great men, if you have any; for, I have a serious design to pay you a visit, in the spring. Who are your writers?—what are they?—You have not mentioned all. In this country, we only know a few of them—such as the writers of the Federalist—some of your Reviewers—and Mr. Trumbull, the poet. Have you any dramatists? architects? sculptors? musicians? poets? novelists? historians? orators? statesmen? tragedians? painters?—Let me know something more about them; and don't forget to give me some general notion of the state of society, politicks, religion—O, I beg you to be particular, respecting that part—for, I begin to attach myself, with emphasis, to theology.— The Editor of that paper there—the Galaxy—seems to be a hardy sort of a fellow—but why does he abuse my stray countryman so bitterly? Who is Mr Pinkney? What is he? A great man, or not? I saw him, once, at St. James's—but I never liked him; and, when I read his official correspondence with our cabinet, there was such an air of laboured nothingness; something, so excessively polite, and round-about, that I began to think humbly, indeed, of him. There is a Mr. Wirt, too; haven't you some such a name? Wirt, or Wart? Let me know something about him. They are Lawyers, I believe---are they not? By the way, is it possible, that a Lawyer can be an honest man? Is it not the most abject and humiliating profession, where the highest prerogatives of man, are set up for sale, to the highest bidder? Nay, that reminds me of a remark of yours; and, if I mistake not, about this very Mr. Pinkney; yes, it was---I am sure of it. You said, that, you could determine, at any time, the amount of the fee, which he had received, by the quantity of sound that he emitted;-- that a scale might be graduated, upon which, without knowing one word of the subject, you would be able to tell, exactly, what quantity of calorick he would give out, on any particular question. Was it he? I am curious to know. Ah, there is another thing. You are always boasting —I mean you Americans, about the freedom of your government! Is it any such wonderful discovery? I think not. Aristotle, you know, has shown, in his political writings, that he was familiar with all the doctrines vol. ii. O of representation; and many cities of Greece practised the same. Make me understand it. And, above all, that must not be forgotten. You used to speak in a way that troubled and distressed me, respecting religion, the errand of our Saviour, and his miracles. If you have changed your opinion—as I hope and pray that you have, let me know. I shall love you, a thousand times better for it. But, if you have not, let me beg of you to be silent. Pass the matter over;—let us not discuss it. Yours, GEO. STAFFORD.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SPENCER RANDOLPH TO MISS RAMSAY. New York, —. If the deepest contrition and sorrow; if a determination, which nothing but death can prevent me from carrying into effect; a determination to repent, and be forgiven by a woman, whom I have deeply wronged; if the knowledge of this can be any consolation to that woman;—I would have her know it. Sarah—dear Sarah—believe me. I have wet the pillow with my tears. I am unable to sleep; and I have arisen, at midnight, to tell thee that my heart is breaking. To-morrow, I was to have departed for the south; but I dare not go—I dare not.— There is a spirit standing in my way; the spirit of a wronged and beloved one, and I dare not advance a step. Here I shall abide, Sarah, even here, whatever be the consequences, till I hear from thee, in reply. I do not ask thy forgiveness yet—I do not deserve it. But—appoint me to any trial—name the hour and the day, when, after having passed through all that shall be required of me, I may venture to approach thee again, in the hope of forgiveness; and I shall not despair of deserving it.— Let not my prayer be in vain. It is for thy sake, Sarah, for thine alone, at this moment, that I pray this; for I tremble and faint, when I reflect upon the insupportable humiliation, to which I have subjected thee. Can I be forgiven?—on any terms—I care not what. Trust me —I have wronged thee, dear; but I am able and ready to recompense thee.—Gracious God!—what do I say!—no Sarah—no!—fly me!—avoid me!—rend my letter in pieces, and scatter it to the winds. There is a fatality that pursues me. I cannot, cannot give thee comfort. Where am I? In truth I do not know. My birth has been mysterious—my dwelling, not among men. I know not where I am, or what—but—nay, nay, Sarah, I cannot break thy heart at once—I cannot tell the whole truth, unpreparedly—it would kill thee. I can only say, that, in seeking to ensnare thee—I have enmeshed myself. I never knew it—I never suspected it; and, when I abandoned thee, in compassion and magnanimity, as I thought—even then, I was more in thy power, than thou wast in mine.—O, what blindness and infatuation. The tyger, at the mercy of his prey. Thy letter awoke me, Sarah—so calm—so affectionate—so sorrowful. Oh— it went to my heart. Tears—tears—the first that I have shed for many a weary day, fell, like rain, upon the paper. I have never knelt—never, scarcely, in my life, except to thank God for some favour, already received; never in sorrow; never in shame; never in humility; but, when I read thy letter, dear—an irresistible something plucked me to the earth, and held me there. I was choking; the hand of God—of the living God, was upon me. I arose, labouring, blinded, and distressed, as if a ligature were drawn about my naked heart, by the hands of a giant;—as if it had been pressed and pressed, till there was no moisture left in it. I felt an alarming heat in my brain. I arose—a strange faintness and darkness came over me, and I fell, with my arms across upon the table. What saved me from death?—Sarah, I know not. For a moment, I was inconceivably frightened. I had not the strength to call out for assistance; and I verily believed that I should never arise again.— But I did—after a few moments, I was able to lift my head. I looked at my fingers—the sweat had oozed out of their ends, and stood upon the table in drops. My hair was wringing wet; and the linen, about my throat and bosom were; as if I had been taken out of the water.— Yet, I was soon upon my feet. Up I stood.—I did not kneel—I would not—and I reasoned with myself. Was this the apoplexy?—No—there was no rushing of blood in the brain—I had not been disturbed by passion. But, it might be so. Well then, thought I—let it be so.— Two more such shocks, and I am no longer a burthen, and a curse to them that love me. And why should I live longer—why wish to live. And then, Sarah, even then, I would have written to thee, and told thee of my contrition, but I was ashamed to do it. I was afraid to do such a thing from fear. I waited, therefore, tillto-night. I am well, now, comparatively well—and, the refore, do I write to thee, and pray thee to forgive me. Let me know it soon—very soon, for I am weary of life. S. RANDOLPH.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">MISS RAMSAY—IN REPLY. I do forgive thee, unhappy man; I do, from the bottom of my soul. Repent, and another will forgive thee; another, whom thou hast more cruelly wronged, more deliberately scorned, than me. O, Randolph, Randolph—I could weep tears of blood for thee. Nay—I would that I were near thee, even at this moment, sick and weary as I am, to comfort thee, in thy desolation. Even to this, am I reduced;—the haughty and presumptuous woman would kneel down before thee, Randolph; and wash thy feet with her tears; and wipe them with her hair— wert thou only, what thou hast appeared to her. I am very ill—very—but I charge thee, not to move—Randolph, I charge thee!—until thou hearest again from me. It will be soon, very soon, if I have life left. I can write no more, now. I am very faint; and thy terrible letter is lying before me—my eyes are upon the close of it—what mean you, Randolph; in mercy! tell me—what mean you. You would not, surely, add the destruction of your own soul, your —. Farewell. I cannot write another line—farewell.—But remember—I charge you to await my next letter. S. RAMSAY.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">JOHN TO SARAH. Dear Sarah, I wrote you, merely to say, that, Frank has arrived at Charleston; and, that, we may expect him in a few weeks. He has succeeded. Your property is secure; and all will probably go right. I can tell you something else that will please you. Molton has some feeling of humanity. He has never seen Juliet but once, since Grenville's departure; and that was in my company. His manner was impressive and mournful; but there was no tenderness in it, though Juliet's eyes were constantly full. I have visited him two or three times; and the result of my observation is, that he ought to be one of the happiest men in the world. His wife is, without any exception, the most wonderful woman that I ever knew—whether for beauty, tenderness or talent. Do not be jealous, Sarah—I know what I say—She is the most wonderful—and perhaps the most beautiful— but not the most holy and dear, nor the most lovely. There is too much majesty and brightness in her deportment;---too much insupportable wildness in her lamping eyes;---too much of passion, voluptuousness, and intoxication, and delirium about her. She is a good deal changed of late.—I should think her mind continually occupied with some profound and awful meditation.— She is absent---and her long, beautiful lashes are often wet and drooping with moisture, ere she appears to know it; and then she lifts up her head—shakes back the abundant richness of her tresses—and her eyes shoot fire again. I have set by her, and watched the changes of her countenance---as she leaned forward, and gazed upon Molton, holding his hands to her heart, while he slept, vol. ii. O 2 as a mother would watch the troubled sleep of her babe, trembling and breathless---till I have thought her the most affectionate and attractive of human beings. And when I last saw her---there was a sudden movement of her countenance, which terrified me, as Molton, in stooping for a book that had fallen---stopped for a moment, as if a serpent had seized upon his vitals. She turned deadly pale---and pressed her lips to his hand with such distracting tenderness, that it startled me. What did she fear?---What was there, in a slight pain of the side, to convulse her, from head to foot, as that did? I know not---but her manner then, and her wild delirious rapture; (for she stood up like something heavenly, in a trance of gratitude, when he slowly lifted himself up, and smiled, and kissed her forehead,) set my heart a throbbing very strangely. I cannot understand these things--- They are not natural. They are more like the love that we read of, than that which we see.---See---what love, what, that ever resembled love? have I ever seen. Ever yours, dear Sarah, JOHN OMAR.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">EDWARD MOLTON TO GEORGE STAFFORD. You have taken my breath away, dear Stafford! what a storm of interrogatories! would you carry me, and all my faculties, at once, by a coup de main? However, let me answer you, briefly, if I can, as many, as I can. And first, I thank you, heartily for your letter. Short as it is, it was very welcome to me; and I am already looking with impatience for another. Several of mine are on the way; and one, in particular, of four or five sheets, in which you will find all your queries about painting anticipated. And first for Byron. If I remember right, I spoke to you only of his Don Juan. You cannot agree with me. I am sorry for it, for I feel convinced that I am right— right, I mean, in my opinion, although I may have failed in expressing it. Once more, therefore, let me place my thought before you, respecting him; and, particularly, respecting his Don Juan; for, of that only, I spoke before; and I should like to bring you over to my doctrine. Byron is a compound, you know, of contrarieties.— The elements of which he is fashioned, are forever at war. The very thoughts of his heart hold no affinity with each other. They can never assimilate, happen what will. We might believe him deranged—but, if he be, it is a moral derangement, not an intellectual one. He has just dashed into the region of tragedy, not with pinions of fire, but in a chariot, of old fashioned Corinthian brass, that rumbles along, through the skies, like the Lord Mayor's coach on a gala-day—over the rough pavement of London. Yet is there the same surly, dark, bitter and unpropitiating character, throughout all that he has written, except in his Don Juan. But that!—O, the blood starts and thrills, when it is named, as if, barefooted, one had trodden upon a nest of matted flowers—full of coiled serpents. There is such a wicked, wanton levity,—such a flippant blasphemy, and all that, in Don Juan. Such at least, your reviewers, dear Stafford, declare to be the sum and substance of the poem. And, with so much distempered eloquence and beautiful invective, hath it been assailed, that, when a plain matter-of-fact man, in his sober senses, takes it up, he is amazed to find how little there is of profligacy or irreligion in it. But, the ball once struck, must be kept up, though it fire the heavens. And to denounce, with all the thunder and lightning of genius, the poem of Don Juan, has become a matter so fashionable of late, that it is really somewhat ridiculous, when one looks at the real importance of the thing. It is all—wind and fire—ocean and tempest—confederating “To waft a feather, or to drown a fly.” It was a sort of prize question, like the death of Napoleon, given out to the four corners of the earth, by the sound of trumpet; a question upon which it seemed impossible to be extravagant; and therefore, all the ambitious spirits of the age have been out; and the noise of their contention hath been very terrible—very—dear Stafford! There was a young and passionate writer in Blackwood's Magazine, whose eloquence is so burning and brilliant, that, touch what subject he will, the alloy and earthiness drop away; and a beautiful vapour arises, by a sort of intellectual alchymy, which blinds and dazzles us to the operation, by its miraculous colouring:—a writer, who can be traced, like the serpent of a flower garden, through all his involutions, by the changeable glitter and fascination that follow him;—or by the coloured vapour that hovers over the spot, where he has hidden himself:— and it happened that he, in the mere wantonness of power, like Rousseau, when he battled against civilization, bethought himself of abusing Byron, under the name of Don Juan. He threw himself upon the poem, with much the same spirit, and with much the same terrour and splendour of aspect too, that we might look for, in a young Leopard, who had leaped, by mistake, upon a creature like himself. But he acquitted himself nobly. It was impossible to read the denunciation of Don Juan, without quailing.— If you had never read the poem, you would have thought, after reading the criticism, that, since the earth was created, there never had been so perilous, wily, and beautiful a devil, among its flowers and perfume. You would have trembled, from head to foot; and, perhaps, have proscribed the poem, as something charged with pestilence and death, to all that was tender, delicate or holy in religion, affection, or morality. The game was well run, in your country; and some of our staunchest huntsmen are out upon the track, in America, at this moment. But it won't do. Their intentions are good, I have no doubt—but they have acted unadvisedly. The harmless pleasantry; the licentiousness and imbecility of Don Juan, have been made too terrible by it. The poem has become so notorious and popular, that—I am half inclined to suspect a conspiracy between the reviewers and the publishers, and perhaps Lord Byron himself;—for nothing could be more profitable than such abuse. The poem has been abundantly over-rated. There are parts in it, which Byron says, are so “very fine” that he does not pretend to understand them, himself. The greater part is the mere ribaldry of conversation. Yet it has, altogether, been denounced, as the most dangerous, wonderful, and profligate poetry that was ever written. Ridiculous!—Its power does not often appear; but, when it does, there is a colour and a light about it, that cannot be forgotten. Its beauty too, is, now and then, bewitching, simple and sweet. Take this example—Haidee, Juan's loved one, dies, broken hearted—and is buried—with vitality—the vitality of love and passion, at her heart. Ah, it is unparalleled, for that devout tenderness—that bleeding of the torn bosom—over branch and bough, fruit and blossom—which all people must feel. “She died—but not alone; she held within, “A second principle of life, which might “Have dawned, a fair, and sinless child of sin; “But closed its little being without light, “And went down to the grave unborn, wherein “Blossom and bough lie, withered with one blight;— “In vain the dews of heaven descend above “The bleeding flower and blasted fruit of love! But these melancholy, tender and mournful touches are not of frequent occurrence. And as to its dangerous tendency; there has been too much fuss made about that already. We read Shakspeare, Cervantes, Fielding, Smollet, Gibbon and Hume, and Rousseau. Why do we not rend and scatter their leaves—and reprobate them, as fiercely, for their brutal licentiousness, passionate eloquence, or infidel scoffing? For my part, I have no such apprehension concerning the influence of Don Juan. By permitting it to be read; or, at least, by not making any particular fuss about it, you will permit it to die a natural death. Prohibit the cup; and, though it were known to be drugged with delirium, you excite a burning thirst, which will be slaked at the peril of perdition. Would you prevent a child from drinking wine? do not worry him, eternally, with interdiction. If you do, you only excite a curiosity to understand the reason of all your alarm; you only provoke him to say that there must be, after all, some secret pleasure, to counterbalance the nausea that he feels, while his taste is unperverted; and, therefore, he persists, even to intoxication, that he may know the truth. So with Don Juan. By interdicting it continually, you have made it familiar to the thought of your women. But why interdict it at all? Are you afraid of your daughters and wives? What! have you so little confidence in the virtue and discretion of your dear ones! Depend upon it, that the woman, who could be corrupted by reading Don Juan, could never be prevented from reading it; or from doing worse, on a fitting opportunity, by any care of yours; and that she would not be worth the trouble of your guardianship. I know women well, much better it may be, than these very men, who affect so to venerate them, that they dare not permit a taint of impurity to approach them. I have a higher opinion too, of their virtue. I am willing to expose them—and confident of their resistance. They are not. I, for my part, have learnt that, that is not virtue, which has not been tempted; and that many a fallen woman is more pure—because she has withstood more temptation, than many, who are yet upright. No—If the people who understand the matter, will let the poison alone, its fiery and dissolving, and corrosive properties will be forgotten. They will be neutralized, by the air and dew of heaven. Let Don Juan alone— and my life on it, that it is forgotten in another twelve month. One word more of Byron, however, while I am in the humour. This downfall is near, and he knows it. Every thing that he has done of late, has been one desperate attempt, after another to regain, his old ascendency. His defence of Pope is impertinent and ridiculous. His war with Southey is contemptible. His speculations about the unities are presmptious and insulting. We know that he disdains them. What else he may do, in his infatuation, it is impossible to predict; but, nothing that he can do, will astonish me, though he should become a wandering Arab; a paltry Gazetteer; or even a clamourous demagogue. All these last vehement aberrations of his, are only the final struggles, of a dethroned Archangel, whose magnificent wings have borne him, too high above their natural element, into an atmosphere, too pure for him to fly in; and a world, too confounding for his contemplation. They that inhabit there, have struck him to the heart. Already, is he reeling in his descent; and the bright confusion that we see now and then, in our glimpses of him, amid the darkness where he lost himself, in his blind and wayward journeying, above the stars, is but the convulsive discharges of a mind, that God hath nearly extinguished; forced into uncommon brightness, by violent and unexpected concussion, with the invisible and inconceivable. It is emphatically the meteorology of that man's mind, which we are made to study; sun-shine and storm—hurricane and lightning—the phenomena of a heart, made up of all the elements that have no affinity to each other —all the materials of decay; and all the principles of immortality—earth and fire. Weary of walking on the earth, and flying in the same heaven with other men, he has sought to burrow in the one, and to get above the other. My belief is, that Byron's whole aim is, to be thought more wicked than he is. The world have consented to humour him. They have agreed to believe that he hath a devil. Alas, they are mistaken. A devil, at heart, would be firmer in purpose. Devils are less wavering. And, spite of all opinion to the contrary, I maintain that Byron is a much better man, husband, and father; and a much weaker one, too, than the world believe. He has none of that iron constancy of nature; that impenetrability of soul, which a great scoundrel must have. He knows this; and, therefore, he affects to be a misanthrope; a scoffer; and a tyrant. Pho---pho—Lord George Gordon Byron would be a very pleasant sort of a fellow, if he had not been born with a club foot. I am altogether in earnest. It is that, which has made him what he is. A deformed man must be better than other men; or he must become vindictive, testy, suspicious and melancholy. He cannot enjoy a thousand pleasures, which are common to them; and, for that very reason, he persuades himself that they are far more delightful than they are. He cannot dance, or walk, or ride, or fence—or appear in places of amusement, except as a sort of qualified spectacle. Ambition has no charms for him—or, at least, none but an evil ambition has. And why? Ask yourself, my dear Stafford, what is the aim, the ultimate and final aim of all ambition. Is it not—reflect a moment, before you reply;—is it not the love of woman?— Can there be an exception—was there ever an exception —think you—where the ambitious man was capable of enjoying her love? Charles of Sweden, and Frederick of Prussia are apt illustrations. How, then, is a deformed man to be ambitious? Not, surely, as other men are; for, though he should be loved, he cannot but distrust the sincerity of that love. To him, it will either be feigned, or mistaken; he will call it appetite or infatuation. He would not dare to be happy, lest he should perpetuate his deformity. Stafford—Stafford—were you a deformed man, would you hazard the begetting of monsters? I feel what I say; and I conscientiously believe that a deformed man must be radically a better man, and constitutionally a kinder man, if he be sociable and amiable to any degree, than any tolerably well fashioned man. What has been the affectation of Byron? Has it not been, continually, as it always will be, with men of perverted power, and distempered bearts, to depreciate whatever is unattainable to him? Are not all his women —what they ought not to be?—and, is not this, perfectly reconcileable to my supposition? But what will be his reputation, with posterity? Which of his multitudinous works will survive? I do believe that I can tell. His tragedies are contemptible. His poems are fine mataphysical prose—compounded of magnificent, but not splendid, and puerile thought. They are never great, nor simple. But his Cain; Manfred; and the Ode to Napoleon will outlive all else that he has written. They are imprinted all over, with the imperishable features of strength and beauty. They will remain, till men shall seek to comprehend, as men now rake among the pyramids, for the vestiges of an ancient world—the nature of that man's mind, which, in our time, sought for immortality, where, to have obtained it, would have damned him; the disposition of a man who sought to hide himself among the constellations of heaven; and then fell, headlong, from his elevation— and was buried, after all, in only a more celestial kind of earth, than other men are content to be buried in; but an earth, nevertheless, that, to his notion, was impregnant with oil and odour, and gave out continual exhalations of light, and mystery or beauty:—of a man, in short, whose grave shall be a place of subterranean musick, forever and ever. “Have we any great men?” you ask. Alas, many. They are plentiful “as blackberries,” and, about as valuable. Every ten miles square has its Solon or Lycurgus; its Cicero and Demosthenes. Every town is fruitful, in the greatest men of the age—of men, who, had they been born in Greece, or Rome, or Great Britain, would have held the nations of the earth in thraldom. So you might believe, if you would trust to our Biographies, and political writings. And yet, we have a few, a very few, even in these, our days of degeneracy, who would have done some honour to the Roman and Greek republicanism, when it was most awful, most simple, and most unrelenting. We have men, that are stern as death. The last age of course, being an age of revolution, abounded more in the mighty. There were the writers of the Federalist, of whom you speak. They were good men, and true. Lately, we have contented ourselves, with talking about what they did. Our great men are content with reviewing the works of the great men that lived then. Thus, Mr. Robert Walsh, who has been persuaded into a notion that he is one of the former, had the presumption, some years ago, to review the Federalist. It was rather an unlucky adventure for him. He praised parts, for discoveries, that were known, from the time of Aristotle's politicks; and spoke lightly enough, or not at all, of other parts, which really were great discoveries in legislation. In short, he wrote a review of a work, the scope and greatness of which, he could not comprehend, unless he were to begin his whole reading again. But the people swallowed it; to their notion, it vol. ii. P was about the finest thing in the world; when, in reality, it is an elaborate, tedious, timid piece of composition, without one stroke of the lawyer, the statesman, or the politician in it. But, while I am upon Mr. Walsh, let me give you some notion of him, as in your country he has been (when he deserved it less,) mistaken for a great man. Mr. Walsh is a man of no genius; if, by genius, we are to understand any inherent, peculiar activity, brilliancy, originality, or disposition of the mind. But, he is a man of plain good sense; some intellectual hardihood, but not much; and respectable acquirements.— He is rather below the middle size; with a countenance, that indicates a cold, watchful, inquiring disposition, united with a little self distrust, and too much anxiety about the good opinion of other men. He is destitute of originality; and has nothing, absolutely nothing, of that quick, intuitive perception of the beautiful and natural, which is the distinguishing property of genius. Consequently, his opinion, not being a natural judgment, is not to be depended upon. No man on earth is more firmly persuaded of his own independent temper, and freedom from prejudice, than this gentleman;—and yet, it is well understood by them that know him, that no man is more obedient to authority—or more a slave to it:—that under a great name, almost any thing would pass, with him—and that, under no name at all, or an humble one, nothing,---except it were a matter of profit, or to conciliate the publick. By this, I mean, for example that Mr Walsh is too distrustful of himself; and is, in reality, so incapable of judging, except, by laborious comparison, which keeps him under a continual fear of imposition, that he would never dare, unless driven to it, by the publick sentiment, to be the herald of any unknown genius. He obtained a reputation too suddenly; and he could not sustain it. But, he lost it, too suddenly—and will, probably, recover a portion of it back again. He is far from being a great man; but, I do believe that he is an able one—about a third rater—and that, if he would get a little the better of his oracular arrogance—and stately nothingness—that profoundly classical air, which he carries forever about him—discharge his heart of its hoarded bitterness—forgive the world, for having turned his head; and for not keeping it turned, by main force; become a little more magnanimous; and, a little less unhappy and suspicious; a little more original and bold; and conceal his alarm, when he is properly arraigned, —I do almost believe that he might do something decent, to be remembered by. But, let me tell the whole truth of the man. He went aloft, too fast and too far, at first; and then, of course, he came down, too fast and too far. He wants that high-minded intellectual courage, which delights in breathing above the rest of men —and braving a stormy atmosphere; he dare not be the first man to pronounce any opinion—and, usually, contrives to be a little behind the sentiment of the publick; taking care to fortify and entrench himself, at every step, against any change in their opinion, by a cautious, cold, qualifying, and stately phraseology, in which he never commits himself. He affects to superintend the wilderness of American literature; yet, no man, in America, is worse fitted for the business. He wants a natural relish---and the natural power, for exploring the beautiful labyrinth; disentangling the wild, flowering luxuriance; or laying open the abundant waters; and hidden, solitary greenness of a great world, to the eye. He wants courage and honesty. Like the writers of the North American Review, he is destitute of feeling; and all his enthusiasm is artificial; he has no heart, and dare not hazard a downright opinion, either pro or con, until he have secured a party, to support him through it, or to participate in the ridicule, if the publick should set him at naught. A pretty example occurs to me, just at this moment. Mr Walsh had the audacity, when Moore's Loves of the Angels appeared, to treat it as a mawkish, common-place, sensual piece of work—and the North American, in its usual tone, contrived to talk about it, in a general way. And yet, there doesn't live the man, who has any natural relish for poetry, that sap o' the heart, which, in the sunshine and light of the world, sets it a flowering all over---who can read it, without a continual thrill, of quiet, deep thankfulness. Most of it is pure poetry—a part, sublime—and, all through it, are spots of insupportable brightness and beauty. But, to return again, for a moment, to Mr. Walsh. He is but just beginning to find, after many revolutions, a proper level. He thinks clearly; reasons with great force, at times; and, were he not a little too much addicted to Edmund Burke, whose passion and power he is really unable to appreciate; but whom he has sometimes imitated, very unadvisedly, and awkwardly, I think,—he would be passably eloquent. Nay, I can point to passages that are full of energy, boldness, and breadth; and he has uttered, in the course of a long political career, two or three burning and bitter sarcasms, which will, probably, outlast all else, that he has ever written. As a critick, I think humbly of him, where plain good sense, or fine taste is required. In the matter of poetry, for example, he is utterly incompetent to decide. He has no feeling, no conception of it. God has left that element out of his heart. And education has only made him worse. Any tolerable rhymer might impose upon him—(were it not for his reading; for he appears to be quite familiar with the old British poets, rather as a matter of education, like geometry, than anything else.—) almost anything, for the labour of Milton, or Dryden, and a few other such men. If he detected the counterfeit, it would not be by any revolting of the heart; any indignant, wrathful, movement of his blood; or outraged sensibility—but, by his memory. Enough for him, if it were written by them, to consecrate the basest trash; and enough, if it were not, to make him wonder at the absurdity of one, who should think of attempting poetry, after such men! Robert Walsh has no notion of the fact;—and, if he were told of it—it would startle him, as if a thunderbolt had exploded at his feet—that the very newspaper poets of the nineteenth century, often betray more of the richness, raciness, sweetness and majesty; strength and simplicity; nay, of all that constitutes poetry, than all the ancient British Classicks together. Yet, it is true—and if the man had any heart, he would feel it; and, perhaps, for I think that he has the worldly wisdom to do so, for his own profit—he would then tell the world of it. Mr. Walsh ought to confine himself to serious, substantial essays; to discharge his heart of all political rancour; and go about some such work as the history of America; like a man that would build for himself, something more permanent than a newspaper fame, which the first wind may scatter, and the first rain dissolve. He ought never to touch the gentle and more spiritual plants of literature, that issue from the air—without deriving any nourishment from the earth—or gush, like coloured water, spontaneously, from the over-heated earth, trembling in the wind, and flowering all over.— Yet he does touch them—he does—and they wither when he does—and, tremble, as if endued with vitality and sensation—or shrink, as with a palsy—contracting and shivering, as at the approach of something unnatural and hateful.” Thus, it is not long since, that he had the presumption to fall upon Washington Irving (him, that you so love, notwithstanding his sickly and delicate affectation,) in the way of criticism. But Mr. Walsh had better let him alone. He was not the man to detect the weak and sore places about the heart of Irving; and he could no more understand the delicacy and sensitiveness of such a nature, than Irving could, the gigantick control of a statesman—sitting unconcerned, between the past and the future—and regulating the operations of the present, with the steadiness of aDeity. Let me give you an example. I remember one, where Mr. Irving, in one of his happiest humours, when the thought seemed to flow out of his heart, as from a fountain, with a sweet, mournful and sorrowing musick— something imaginary and spiritual—with here and there a faint flourish of cheerfulness;—was telling something about an old family mansion, where the heaviness and grandeur of other times, were perpetually intruded upon, by the pert and flippant innovations of the present. There was something of family pride, and patrician jealousy, to be seen in the very furniture. And the older chairs, said Mr. Irving, were all standing haughtily together, and aloof from the modern ones—as if they associated vol. ii. P 2 to rebuke and discountenance all further plebeian encroachment. The thought was well-turned and natural —and I wish that I could remember the words; for I see that I have spoilt it. Yet, Mr. Walsh dared to treat it as a conceit. Nor was this all; he went through one of the Sketch Books, with the same ignorant audacity; and laid the iron hand of criticism, upon every beautiful and innocent thought there—crushing, with a spiteful emphasis, whatever appeared most timid and delicate. It was barbarous. I have never forgiven him. There were parts enough about Mr. Irving, accessible to one that understood him—parts, that were diseased, and that required a stern and healthful application; but Mr. Walsh was not the man—even if the medicine were put into his hand, to drug a spirit like Irving. They could never touch—never approach, without a mutual jarring of antipathy. As well might the men that— —“Carve at their meal “With gloves of steel; “And drink their red wine through helmets barred: amuse themselves with nursing geraniumsa;—or, attempt to battle with shadows; and minister, with the dagger and chalice in their hand, “to a mind diseased.” Mr. Irving is no poet—Mr. Walsh is no poet. But the former has a natural relish for poetry; and the latter has no relish at all, either natural or acquired. Both affect a poetical feeling:—but it is less ridiculous in the former, because there is, with all his sentimentality and squeamishness, and melancholy, a holy, quiet and sweet spirit, forever haunting the lonely avenues to his brain.— And no man writes so happily, so touchingly, so naturally, when his spiritualizing refinement gives way for a moment. And then his humour—how captivating it is! You are delighted; and you have no trouble in communicating your delight. You have no argument, no reasoning to waste—you have only to point to the page, and the thing is done. Observe—I do not speak of his BRACE BRIDGE HALL—that, you are to answer for. It is a disgrace to Irving; and a disgrace to his countrymen.— It is altogether English. Such is the character of Mr. Irving; such that of Mr. Walsh. It is perfectly ridiculous for the latter to talk of poetry, or sentiment. They are something, of which he has not, and never had the faintest conception. Nor is it necessary that he should have. He will get along the faster in this world; and die a wiser and richer man, than if he had. A relish for poetry never helped to make any man truly great. It may make him interesting, or ridiculous—but nothing more. And when Mr. Walsh laid his hand, with the best disposition in the world, I dare say, to nurse them, upon the violets that Irving had tufted the green earth with, about his dwelling—and crushed them—had that hand been stung to death, he would have deserved it, for his blundering— but he hath left some blood upon the flowers—and carried, away, what he is yet ignorant of—a perfume, that is not natural to him. I hardly know what to say of our other writers. They are numerous enough; and, oftentimes, well characterized. But our taste is bad. Our literature is corrupt and eprverted; one class of our writers are all of the sleepy, milk and water-school of Addison; another, intemperate and florid. They never change characters—never. No matter what may be the theme, their language is the same. They go—the former, to a fire as to a funeral; and the latter, to a funeral as to a fire. One is never on stilts; the other, always. As a people, we are too fond of the unnaturally smooth, continued and entangled sentence. Nothing else is classical with us. No matter how abrupt and hazardous the thought is, in its nakedness, it is not the etiquette of our school, to reveal it boldly;—and, when you should be able to pursue the meaning, as vividly, as a creature wrought upon tapestry, you find it so warped and webbed into it, with such perpetual involution, departure and entanglement, that is impossible to follow it; and you throw the work by, as you would a web of different coloured yarns, where all was beautiful, and brilliant, and unmeaning. It were easy to give you a specimen of the higher style among us—it is not a little like what you may see every day, in the labour of men, who have been drilled after artificial models;—and, if you turn to your Edinburgh Review, you will, now and then, find the happiest illustration. It is a work of great influence here; and, though I defy you to point out a page of English, in the last two volumes,—unpolluted with jargon, barbarism, or provincialism, yet it is one of our standards. Some are men, like Dr. Johnson, who never know what to do with a big word, or when to let it go.—They crowd epithet upon epithet, until their style is a sort of dislocated blank verse. One distinct blow will leave a distinct impression. Many blows will leave none at all. One seal, though it be a feeble one, set fairly, will leave an impression; where many, that are more beautiful, put one upon the other, will leave none. In reading, one emphatick word, properly applied, may electrify you:— many have no effect at all. So, one powerful thought, though it be not the very best in the world, will be remembered forever, when judiciously applied, where many that are better, if crowded together, will be forgotten, as soon as heard. The attention is distracted; the faculties chafed and irritated, by the multiplication of good words; and the immeasurable length of what are called classical sentences. Do men talk so, in conversation? Do they even declaim, or think so? No. Then why do they write so? Should not their writing be a transcript of their thought? One would think, sometimes, that the words which they use, had been stumbled upon, and that they, fearful of not finding them again, when they should want them, had huddled them all in together-to make sure of them: or, that they were willing to become familiar with them by use—no matter when or where—as people rehearse, very unseasonably, at times, what they hope to practise, on some other occasion, impromptu:—or, that they were lecturing on tautology. Such writers, if they had a dozen seals, would never be satisfied with giving you the impression of any one of them, upon a letter. No! they would stamp the whole set, one upon the other. It were as rational, to hope, by writing again and again, over what is already written, in different coloured ink, (which is admitting that the words are not synon imous) in the hope of rendering you thought more distinct? But, so it is; and there are men among us, who seem to have a constitutional dread of coming to the point— and some of them pass for orators.—They approach a subject as if it were a wild beast, by going round and round it; and there is one man,[10] [10] A lawyer—I know him, too.—Ed. a smooth, gentlemanly, agreeable speaker, to all the world, among whose qualifications, beside that of never ending a sentence, never! ---is that of never touching his subject, but as if it were a globe—and all the extremities of his fingers were globular too; of course they cannot touch but in one point, and that, he seems to avoid, with a mortal dislike:---and, sometimes, when I have known him to blunder, with the most innocent countenance in the world, upon it---I have seen him thrown back, as if electrified.---Yet, he always keeps on, with the same quiet manner, as if nothing in the world had happened.--Nay, if he ran against a line of battle-ship, or an island, while he was playing about in his painted cock-boat;---and were sent to the bottom, he would be the last to suspect it himself---or, as soon as he could get his breath, he would, probably, be the first man to condole with both, for their shipwreck! I think that I may give you an illustration of his manner, and that of some of our writers, at the same time.-- “If one might be permitted, under any circumstances whatever, to think that a transaction so notorious, had been perpetrated as it was, I should be inclined to say, quite positively, if I am not mistaken, and do rightly understand the subject, which I must confess is a very difficult one, as I have, on more than one occasion said, with considerable emphasis to the gentlemen of this society, for which, if I am wrong, I humbly submit myself to the reproof of the chair, which has been so long filled with a dignity and courtesy, that, if I may be allowed to express my opinion—for there is nothing, which I more heartily depise, than adulation, I should say, in short sir—it is my opinion that—if the subject were rightly considered, it would be found very difficult, very difficult indeed.” You smile—my dear friend. But there is more than one man in America, who writes and talks such deliberate smooth nonsense as that—and that too, without the slightest suspicion, in his own mind, or that of a hearer, that he is paddling about and about the subject. But he talks on—like your parliamentary speakers, permitting no pause or break in the sound; and knowing that there is no memory to follow him; and that the note-takers will make English of it, at their leisure—and imagine a meaning, if it be possible; or, if that cannot be, make an apology, and totally omit it; or add that the articulation of the gentleman was so timid and faint, or so rapid and vehement; or, that they were carried away by his eloquence, so confounded by the noise that followit, that, “they” have done him great injustice--injustice! --the cruellest thing, that they could do, would be to do him justice. You speak of Mr. Trumbull.—There is, to be sure, a great deal of humour and drollery about him; but he is no poet. Yet we have poets—poets, of every character and degree; and more than one that, if he were in your country, would be placed in the first rank. There is a young man, (whose name I know not) at New-York, who has just been amusing us with a tissue of wit, whim and poetry, that show him to have within him, powers of the most varied and attractive character. Nay, some of his lines would make your blood thrill—and there are passages in his Fanny, (a poem written in imitation of Don Juan) that Lord Byron, himself, could not read, without a flutter of pride at the heart. The worst fault of our poets, is, that they will borrow and imitate.— This I cannot endure. Yet all of them are guilty of it— all—I cannot except one. Some affect originality too, to such an excess, that you are kept aching eternally after the thought. Such men would not do the commonest thing in a common way.—There is the author of Niagara, for example-the chief notion that he has of greatness, is that of being unlike everybody else.—He would'nt use his pocket-handkerchief, I dare say, as other people use theirs. But why complain of our poets for imitation?— when yours are literally a school of imitators. I can trace half a dozen to Wordsworth—There is Colridge— Hunt—Bary Comwall—and even Byron himself. Nay, show me one page of your English poetry, ancient or modern, of unadulterated originality; and I will go down on my knees before it. There is a Mr. Allen, also, here, whom I have already mentioned to you, who makes poetry—when he least intends it;—and almost always fails when he goes about it, in downright earnest. There is a Mr. Pierpont too, who has written one or two poems, that have been praised all over our country—for everything that is wonderful or pleasant, among the anointed of Apollo. One reveres his chief poem, for its strength and grandeur--another, for its sweetness and tenderness--one for this, and another for that. And nothing can be more ridiculous. There is no intoxication; no delirium; nothing of the marvellous in it. It is a temperate, mild, beautiful affair—and that is all; but some of his little poems—a few hymns—are among the most exquisite in our language. The poet's mind appears too much warped and trammelled by his fondness for Beattie and Campbell, and that school, ever to astonish. He never alarms nor inflames—he never thunders nor lightens—there are no phenomena, agitated into life, by his sorcery—but there are passages of surpassing beauty, and vividness in his best poem; with quite too much that is feeble and common place. There is also a Mr. Bryant, of whom I know nothing, except that I once saw some lines, a very few, that awed me. He is a poet. There is a Mr. Osborne too, of whom you may have heard a good deal, because for the last ten years, he was the only standard poet of our country. Yet what has he written?—It were difficult to tell. Some short pieces of fifty or an hundred lines— with here and there a great thought; but never a whole page of poetry in his life.[11] [11] Where is Mr. Southwick?—Ed. There is Dr. Percival, who, if he had not been praised by Mr. Walsh, I should call a very fine poet; but, as it is, I do confess that I am in doubt; and, were it not for certain lines to Consumption; and a few very beautiful passages in certain other short pieces of his, I should not have mentioned him. But they are delightful—full of composure, delicacy, and tender feeling—a natural melancholy, and rich harmony. He wants boldness, originality and vehemence; but he is a man of unquestionable genius, and an honour to our country. The worst of it is, that our men of genius, have a foolish notion, that, to be melancholy, unsocial, and misanthropical, is the only way to prove to the world, that they are men of genius. Alas—there are ailments of the constitution and heart, common to men of sensibility, and they are always men of genius, which, if they are wise, they will rather conceal than betray. It is humiliating to be pitied—but, to be pitied by the world, is enough to kill a poetical nature, while in actual flower; enough to freeze the sweet fountain that trembles in his heart, at every change of the atmosphere about it---foretelling sunshine and rain, the sunshine and rain of popular favour, like a barometer. So much for Dr. Percival. And then there is Mr. Paulding.---By the way, can you ascertain who wrote the notices of his Backwoodsman, in some of your papers. He is charged with it, here--- but I cannot believe such a thing. I am more charitable. The poem is a silly, affectedly simple—sluggish stupifyng affair, enough, to be sure; but there is a very good reason why it should be favourably received in England, without charging Mr. P—as the author of the reviews. This was your policy. I understand it. By taking up the Backwoodsman, and praising it, as you have, for the best specimen of our transatlantick poetry; what must your good people have thought of the rest.— The best specimen of our poetry!—gracious heaven—we have boys, mere children, who would weep, for shame, to be suspected of the authorship, although some passages are very fine and very free. Yet Mr. Paulding is really a man of talent. Some of his prose is excellent. He is only a little too ambitious; and, in attempting to balance himself for the higher regions of composition, he shivered awhile—eddied, and then came down—for what reason it might be difficult to tell—upon his head. His letters from Old England, however, are an honour to him and to us.[12] [12] Not his.—Ed. One cannot help loving his heart, and admiring his head, when less indiscriminately employed. There is a Mr. Fessenden also, who once buttoned himself up; and mounted the stilts of rhyme—but, he had better remained in prose—slept quietly—and been gathered to his fathers, for what he is, in all probability, a troublesome, honest, well meaning sort of a man. There was also another young man—I dont know his name, who wrote a poem called Chrystalina, some years ago, in New-York. It was a work of extraordinary merit, though very tedious; less for a want of power and opulence of thought in the author, than from his fearfulness, and unwillingness to lose aught that he had once written:—good or bad, in it went—with all its variations. He might be made a great poet. There is another man too, named Neale,[13] [13] NEAL—not Neate. There is an English poet of the latter name; and a Scot—Henry and Hector.—Ed (did I mention him?) who has written some poems—a—history— and a tragedy; the latter of which, comes nearer, I should imagine, to your notions of the sublime than any thing of the day. It is darkness and mystery from beginning to end. The catastrophe is striking—but nobody can understand it. And so with his poetry. You are alarmed, agitated,—but it would be difficult to tell why. He affects scholarship; yet a part from some shocking blunders in latin, such as “exitomnes;” Ala, a woman “solus.” There are some barbarisms and vulgarities, that will constantly provoke you. For instance, he makes one of his characters ask, “who have I slain?—who have I hidden,” &amp;c.and his chief notion of blank verse would seem to be, that it should consist of ten syllables—more or less; and, sometimes, one would fancy that he had written a page or two, while in heat;—and then, counted off the words, into lines of ten or a dozen syllables each;—for very often, where the thought is strong and beautiful, there is a total want of rhythm and cadence. But alas! —it is the fashion of the age. He affects too, a colloquial manner, even on the most solemn occasion. His names too, are infinitely amusing—turkish—and christian. O-la is a hero—and A-la, a heroine in the same piece!—Achmet, Selim and Otho. Did you ever vol. ii. Q read Barry Cornwall's Mirandola? I send you a copy of Otho. Compare the passages that I have marked, for yourself. Are not such resemblances astonishing? Otho was published a long time before Mirandola. It is not at all probable, that Barry Cornwall; or, rather, Mr. Proctor, had even seen it; for, it is but little known in America: and if he had seen it, will any man suppose that so fine a genius would borrow so largely from an unknown American tragedy. The very words are the same, in more than one case; and the sentiments. manner, and incidents more surprisingly alike, than those of Manuel and Lear. I was very forcibly struck with them; and, it was not till I had satisfied myself, that Otho had been first published here, that I could believe them to be accidental. I have recently seen a novel of his, called Keep Cool—a foolish, fiery thing—with a good deal of nature and originality; and much more than a good deal of nonsense and flummery in it. There is a history of the American Revolution too, part of which was written by him;—most shamefully printed—it comes out under the name of Paul Allen. There are other works attributed to him; but denied, it is said, by him; one of which, called Logan—is, to my notion, little other than one interminable dream—without moral or design—but alive with some tremendous apparitions: and another, called Seventy-six, which I cannot but think altogether too good, and too great a work for him to have written. There are really some meaning, and some sort of design, to be seen in Seventy-Six. His characteristick as a POET, is—a laboured originality in every thing; which is exceedingly ridiculous. He seems to have no settled design; no purpose in view, but merely to rhyme on, head over heels, page after page, as if to get rid of some delirium upon him.—He rains his imagery upon you; and rages through all heaven and earth for epithets; and nothing is more common than for him, when comparing one thing with another, to add half a dozzen gratuitous comparisons to each. Thus, he will say that such a sky is like the blush of a fountain, at sunset —which is like the plumage of a seraphim, ruffled and rippling all over, in the wind—which plumage is like changeable silk—which silk is like the ocean, in a calm, covered with “oily gold and green,”—like some steely weapon in the setting sun—and here, you perceive, he gets back to just where he started from. But enough of him—You never could get through his poem, I am sure; and the story goes that his own mother took to her bed, when it apeared, and has not held up her head since. But after all, I don't see any great use in poetry.— Whatever can be said well in poetry, may be said better in prose. The chief advantage of poetry is, that it may be more easily remembered; and transmitted, by tradition. But, tradition and memory are repositories, altogether too expensive and uncertain, while books are so plenty and so cheap. One might as well commit a geography as a poem, now. In the time of Homer and Ossian, it was very different; geography, itself, could only be transmitted in poetry. Another mischief in poetry, (I speak of what other men call poetry---rhythm, cadence, measure, and rhyme, which are not at all essential to what I call poetry,) is, that it leads us to admire a thing for its difficulty—apart from all consideration of its beauty or utility. I cannot do this. Hence, I do not love the learning of the German musick, nor the refinement of the modern Italian;—nor can I endure their opera dancing. So thought Alexander, when he rewarded the man, who amused him by shooting small seed through the eye of a needle, with miraculous dexterity—by presenting him with a half bushel of seed. Yet, what is rhyme, and all the artificial constraints of poetry, but the vestiges of that barbarous taste, which formerly delighted in conundrums, acrosticks, rebuses, riddles, and alliteration? It is worse. Pope, to be sure, persuaded himself that he could rhyme, better than he could prose. I do not deny it. He was never eloquent or impassioned. He never thought poetry, nor understood it. He was naturally addicted to epigram—sententious, laconick, pungent, stinging brevity:---but, notwithstanding his authority, I say, that men naturally seek to express themselves in prose; and that rhyme and cadence, and all that, are only temptations to a round-about, inadequate mode of expression---so that you never get the first thought of a poet, except in a prosaick passage. Nor is it all wonderful, that, after a time, men should have come to accept of poetical language for poetical thought; the embellishments of poetry, for poetry itself, as they have at this day. Take any page of what you call poetry, that you will, ancient or modern; and I will point to a page of what the world call prose, which shall contain more poetical thought and expression.--- Look at our modern poems, I care not whose, and you will be ashamed of your foolish infatuation, if you come to examine the thought nakedly; the number and variety; the beauty, freshness, and originality of the pictures.--- How much of it is poetical language! How little of it poetical thought! I hope to see this done with. I believe that I shall live to see it done with. I do not say this, out of ignorance or obstinacy; for I can write poetry—what men call poetry, quite as readily as I can prose; and I conscientiously believe what I am saying; nay, more—I believe that the age of poetry is past; that such men as Lord Byron, had better throw by poetry, altogether; and take up prose writing, if they want to be remembered, for another century. He is coming to it, already, step by step, in the perverseness of Childe Harold, and his tragedies;and in the familiar, colloquial manner of Don Juan. Let them write fiction—but, let their fiction be in prose; let them put out all their power, upon a literature that all may read, century after century—I do not mean quote, and keep in their libraries, but read. The day of the Epick has gone by, never to return. No matter what may become of the world—it will never be again, a sufficient time, under the dominion of any one people, nation or tongue, for any one poem, ever to become, again, a work of immortality, or even of national pride. But, what shall these men write?—Novels or Romances?—If they aim to instruct the publick, the very multitude; and not to allure or amaze, let them write Novels, like those of Miss Edgworth; which are fine, natural models, destitute of phrensy; useful, and uniformly attractive; but, if they aim to do something more; to take captive the hearts of the mighty; let them write Romances, with such kind of exaggeration, as you find in the best parts of the Waverly novels;—but let it be more frequent, and lasting, vivid and intense. I say exaggeration—because, if there be no exaggeration, there will be none of that trance-like agitation and excitement, which nothing but poetry can produce in the blood of men. Are the incidents and characters of the Waverly novels natural? No.—They are all exaggerated, more or less;— and the best parts of the whole, are the most exaggerated —such as the characters of Jenny Deame, Bailey Jarvis, Claverhouse, Meg Merrilies, &amp;c. &amp;c. and that is the reason,---because they are unnatural; and not, because they are natural, that they affect us; unnatural, I mean, because they are not like any thing in the nature of our experience. If they were, we should care little for them. In one sense, they are natural, because we do not see, at once, that they are impossible. Nor, are they historically true, in one single case. Yes—I do, in my heart, believe that we shall live to see poetry done away with—the poetry of form, I mean--- of rhyme, measure, and cadence. Yet, in place of it, will arise a mightier poetry, which will be the work of the mightiest. The revolution is at hand; men are trying every kind of experiment, to perpetuate their strength, in the eternal language of musick and poetry; and they will, I have no doubt, leave such a legacy behind them, in what the world now call prose, that another generation will treat what this calls poetry, as we now treat the alliteration and acrosticks of the generations that are gone. But will poetry itself become extinct. No, never.— You never can put out that light. As well might you hope to blot out the polar system. No: poetry is the “divinity within us.” It will be the better understood; and far more devoulty worshipped, when this revolution shall have taken place; when the great, beautiful thought, of the anointed among men,shall be disincumbered of words without meaning. Poetry is the naked expression of power and eloquence. But, for many hundred years---poetry has been confounded with false musick---measure and cadence---the soul with the body---the thought with the language---the manner of speaking, vol. ii. Q 2 with the mode of thinking. The secondary qualities of poetry have been mistaken for the primary ones. What I call poetry, has nothing to do with art or learning. It is a natural musick---the musick of woods and waters; not that of the orchestra. It is a fine, volatile essence, which cannot be extinguished or confined, while there is one drop of blood in the human heart, or any sense of Almighty God, among the children of men. I do not mean this, irreverently---I mean, precisely, what I say--- that poetry is a religion as well as a musick. Nay--- it is eloquence.---It is, whatever affects, touches, or disturbs the animal or moral sense of man. I care not how poetry may be expressed, nor in what language, it is still poetry; as the melody of the waters, wherever they may run; in the desert or the wilderness; among the rocks or the grass, will always be melody. It is not artificial musick---the musick of the head---of learning, or of science; but it is one continual voluntary of the heart; to be heard every where---at all times---by day-- and by night, whenever men will stay their hands, for a moment, or lift up their heads and listen. It is not the composition of a master; the language of art, painfully and entirely exact; but, it is the wild, capricious melody of nature---pathetick or brilliant, like the roundelay of innumerable birds whistling all about you, in the wind and water—sky and air; or the coquetting of a river breeze over the fine strings of an Eolian harp---concealed among green leaves and apple blossoms. All men talk poetry, at some time or other, in their lives; even the most reasonable, cold-hearted, mathematical and phlegmatick; but most of them, without knowing it—and women, yet more frequently, than men: and young children too, talk it, perpetually, when alarmed or delighted. Yet they never talk in rhyme; nay, nor in blank verse. Even the writers of tragedy—the most perverse of God's creatures—do now and then, stumble upon this truth—for, in all their passionate and deepest passages, they do all that they can, to get rid of the foolish restraint of rhythm. And when they do not—they are, to the full, as absurd as the opera-singer—who murders and makes love, by the gamut. Poetry too, is the natural language of the human heart—its mother-tongue; and is, just as naturally resorted to, on any emergency or distress, by the devout—the terrified—the affectionate—the tender-hearted and the loving—the widowed and the afflicted—as a man's native tongue is, when, after having been a great while among strangers, where he has learnt a strange language, good enough for all the common purposes of life—he is called upon, by some signal, and unexpected calamity, to pray aloud; or to cry out, with a broken and bowed spirit, or a crushed heart. Instantly, that man over-leaps all time and space—and, falls down, before the woman that he loves; or his Maker, with the very language that his mother taught him, when he fell upon his little knees, and lisped the dictated prayer after her, syllable by syllable. Just so, it is, with poetry. Prose will do for common people; or, for all the common occasions of life, even with uncommon people. We cannot drive a better bargain, or make a better argument in poetry, than in prose. But strike us here, into our very vitals, with some weapon of fire; and see how instantly a combustion takes place, inwardly—within all of us—flaming at our eyes, and trembling on our tongues, like inspiration. The poetry within us takes fire, and becomes audible and visible.— We might have died, without thinking that we were combustible, but for something that had jarred all our blood, like an earthquake. I speak of this matter, freely and boldly, because I know that I am competent to speak of it—and fully authorized to bear witness against the mischievous and perverted tendencies, of poetical thought, when it is put, like a beautiful child, or a strong giant, into shackles and gyves; hand-cuffs and pinions. Some men affect to talk about it; and to give rule for it, who never had a poetical idea in their heads. Fools! they might as well learn eloquence from an automation; or swimming, by seeing other people swim, as how to make poetry, by reading and studying the great masters—and listening to the jackasses, who are called criticks; not one, in a million of whom ever was, or ever will be a poet. Why?—because if a man be a poet, he will lack, nine hundred and ninety nine times out of a thousand, either the judgment; or the moral courage; or the honesty, to criticise boldly; and to speak of poetry as it deserves; and more than that, if he be a poet, he will be above the practice of criticism. My notion, in one word, is—that poetry is the natural language of every human heart, when it is roused--or inflamed, or agitated, or affected: and that prose, on the contrary, is the natural language of every human heart, on all other occasions; and that rhyme, or blank verse, or regular rhythm, is altogether as artificial, unnatural and preposterous a mode of expression, for the true poet; as the use of a foreign idiom, or foreign phrase, is to the true home-bred man. The Romans affected to talk Greek; the Germans do talk French—as if they were ashamed of their mother language; and so do poets talk in rhyme or blank verse—but, let them all talk ever so beautifully, one can always discover that it is not natural to either of them. They are too Attic—or too provincial—too exact, or too slovenly. To put this in another light---one example will do more than a volume of abstract reasoning. Could you possibly hold out to read any poem, by the greatest poet that ever lived, which should contain as many words, as one of the Waverly novels? It would be about five or six times as long, as Paradise Lost. If it were the best of poetry, would you not get the sooner tired of it? Assuredly. In the confusion of such a beautiful and confounding exhibition of power and brightness, your senses would lose all their activity: they would reel under it; and retain no distinct impression at all.— It would be like seeing a multitude of beautiful women, at the same moment—in a place, crowded with august personages—innumerable pictures—statuary—delicious musick and fire works.—What would you remember of the whole?—nothing. How many volumes of prose do you read in a year? and how many would you read, if the same things were told in verse! Probably not a hundredth part, as many as you do now; hence the superiority of prose, if one want to convey instruction, or amusement; or obtain reputation, glory, or popularity. Do not tell me that poetry will out-last prose. That is no longer true. More volumes of poetry are written now, in one year, than there used to be of prose, in a century, before the invention of printing. Epicks are out of fashion: poetry cannot live, unless it be continually read: and no poetry will be so continually read as fine prose. But if the prose be very fine—very pungent, great, fiery and beautiful—it will not be relished by the mob. Hence madam de Staehl is not popular: and, hence, the Waverly novels are; nay, in proportion to the great excellence of any writer, will be the limited number of his admirers. He, who means to be popular, must dilute not only his characters—incidents—and doctrines, but his thought and language. He must make his heroes angels or devils—Sir Charles Grandisons, or Laras and Marmions:—in that, he must do as the Waverly man has done; but even he has not diluted enough.— Therefore, miss Edgeworth will outlast him in popularity; not that her power is worthy of comparison, for a moment, with his—in reality—yet, in another age, it will be far more highly appreciated, and more generally understood —She is always on a level with the ordinary capacities of men. The result of all that I can say, therefore, is, that the first rate works of genius—no matter of what kind— never have been—are not—and never will be, so generally popular, as the second or third rate. All men quote Shakspeare and Milton; and often without knowing it; yet who reads either? I have never met with but one man who had read Paradise Lost through—or who was willing to acknowledge it;—and he made a boast of it, as if he had achieved something miraculous—: adding, with a shake of the head—when he was asked his opinion of it, that, “for his part—other men might say what they pleased—but it was a d—d fine poem—only he did'nt believe more than one half of it.” So with Mad. de Staehl. Every body talks about her—yet who reads her?—only the eloquent and polite; and half of them, because they are ashamed not to have read her.[14] [14] So with Rousseau's Heloise. Who ever read that a second time?—Ed. Yet, had all these persons written in an humble style, they would have been, at this hour, in the hands, and upon the tables of all the world, as the Spectator, and the Vicar of Wakefield have been. Stay —here is a newspaper, open before me. Now I will make a bet, that, on opening it. I shall find some foolish quotation, from no matter whom, but somebody, who is only quoted, not read; which will travel through every paper in America—solely because the newspaper editors are attracted by it, in the page,—no matter what is tailed to it. Just as I thought! Here is an account of a black woman, who killed herself for love, or jealously. So the editor introduces the story with— “Jealousy, the green ey'd monster, “That makes the meat it feeds on.” There Stafford!—six months hence, you may open a paper from Alabama; some part of the interiour, where they have just heard of the abdication of Napoleon; and are beginning to make a fuss about the Baltimore mob; the sea serpent; or your trial of the queen—and you will find that very quotation. Yet nobody can tell why it was there; and as for the merit of the thought, can any thing be more beastly—or less beautiful—or apt—or descriptive of that passion Jealousy, whom even Collins, in his paroxysm of inspiration, has described but feebly—that pale woman, with the haggard-lip.— Nay, the very best poetry, and the purest of old times, may be met with now, in such constant use, that we are no longer affected by it, in any way. These newspaper men cannot speak of children, but as the “pledges of affection:” of a fire, but as the “devouring element;” of death, but as the “insatiate archer;” nor of the dew, on the grass, but as the “gems of the morning.”— What shall be done to them? what, for ourselves: let us be distinguished by our simplicity, on all common occasions, by a language always fitted to the subject. Remember my words. A great revolution is at hand.— Prose will take precedence of poetry: or rather poetry will disencumber itself of rhyme and measure; and talk in prose—with a sort of rhythm, I admit—for there never was an eloquent sentence, written or spoken, since the creation of the world, without a rhythm and cadence in it—a musick of its own—it is a part of the nature of eloquence, to be poetical and melodious. Yes, I repeat it—Poetical thought, written like prose, will yet supersede poetry, in the affection and reverence of the age.— Rhyming will be confined to songs—and blank verse to sonnets:—chiefly, that the former may be remembered; and the latter wondered at, like any foolish exercise of ingenuity. Finally, there is a Mr. Walter—the author of some strange, beautiful, trashy, fantastick and disordered poetry. Yet he has written but little, and I cannot waste my time on him. So much for our poets. I have enumerated all that I can now recollect. Good night— one of these days I shall answer the rest of your inquiries. EDWARD MOLTON.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SARAH TO JULIET New-York, —. Are you terrified, Juliet? Look at the date again. I am actually in New-York, once more. Can you believe your senses? How is your health?—your self command? I have need of your advice—I am desperate—my pride is in the dust—my religion—my piety—O, heaven!—I have nothing of either left. It is blasphemy to mention them. Juliet!—hear me! Bear with me! I am alone, dying perhaps—broken of heart, and desolate—and I want thy consolation, more than all other; for I dare not, O, no, I dare not apply to heaven. Yet—mark me, if thou art not in a situation to give it to me;—if thou art faint of heart—or ill—or weary in spirit;—if thou art not prepared for every thing—stop, where thou art—burn the letter—and lay thee down, quietly — and let me die, alone—* * * * * * * * * * * What have I been saying, dear Juliet? I am very weak—very—and there is a strange feeling of distraction at my brain, that alarms me. I want thy advice, Juliet. But let me tell thee why * * * nay, nay—not to night. I must try to sleep, and tomorrow, if I have life enough left, I shall finish the communication—if not—it must go, as it is. Farewell, SARAH RAMSAY.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SAME TO SAME. I am more composed, this morning, dear Juliet;—nay —this afternoon, I should say, for I never opened my eyes, after I shut them, last night, until about an hour since. It is near evening now. The letter, that I began yesterday, has gone, I see I am afraid that it will distress you, dear Juliet;—and I am sorry that I gave the order, as I did last night; but then, I did not expect to be so well. I have nobody to blame;—poor Mary did, just as I ordered; she put the letter in the office, at the last moment, before the mail went out—and the doctor forbade her to wake me. Yes, Juliet, I am in New-York. Nay, more---I have set my heart upon a disclosure; and I will not be baffled now, though it cost me my life. It is one of shame, terrour, and dishonour, Juliet—yes, dishonour, for I have fallen in my own respect; and I shall not spare myself. I have met Randolph again. You were right, in your belief. I loved him—even without suspecting it. But I was awake, before I received your letter, Juliet. Yes—I have met him again. He fled—and I—even I, Juliet, have followed him here! What think you now, of your sister, Juliet? I disdain to palliate—to shrink --or tremble. I am prepared for every thing—for anything. My whole nature is changed. I am no longer sensible to fright and remorse;—no, nor to shame. I am indifferent almost—almost, Juliet, to thy opinion. Judge then, to what a depth I have fallen. I am sitting alone, alone—no mortal near me—my countenance, I am sure, is very stern; and big drops of sweat are falling upon the paper, as I write. What supports me?—I know not. Two days ago, I was so weak, that I could scarcely raise my hand to my head—yet now—I am sitting unsupported, unsus— * * * * * * * * * * * * I have recovered Juliet— it was only a momentary faintness. I had been thinking too intently,—my head was low; and, when I arose, it grew suddenly dark—the pain is rather severe, yet—I must lie down, awhile. 12 o'clock. I have had my table brought to my bed side; and, lest my strength should not endure to the conclusion, I will begin with that which is the sum and substance of all that I have to say;---and finish the letter, as I can. Spencer Randolph is a married man. There!---there! Juliet, I defy thee, now; I have told it! ---my heart is lighter, by a world. But let me tell thee, just as it happened, how I arrived at the truth. I loved Randolph, as I have told thee, before; but I loved him, before I knew it; and, when I knew it, I cried for shame and vexation. How had he won me? I knew not—I was afraid of him:—and the only thing, I believe it was the only thing—that really touched my heart, in his whole deportment, was the tone of his voice.—That used to thrill through and through me, particularly when he read. I knew not what secret power the man had over my thought; but, it did seem, that he understood every pulsation of my heart; and read to all the mysterious movement within me; for, whatever he read, seemed to have a fiery adaptedness; a something, fit and appropriate to my very thought and feeling at the time. I was unaccustomed to tenderness. I had ridiculed it. The tenderness of the world—of the stage—of novels, was all sickening to me;—but his—ah, it was so deep, and strange and passionate, that my heart caught the infection, and palpitated at his voice, as if there was something alive here, that answered every word. But I awoke. I perceived my danger. Yet I strove to conceal the knowledge from him. I deceived myself. We parted, as friends;—and I felt as if a part of my own heart had been torn away.—I began to view my conduct.—I vol. ii. R was very sick and low spirited. There was something to tremble for, I confess;—and yet, I could find little to blame, in him. It had been rather my fault, than his.—I had thrown myself, literally, upon his bosom, in the consternation of my thought, when the first feeling of love came to me; and what could he do?— He could not cast me off. There was only one way left. He adopted it. He fled. Nay—to consummate his purpose, and to atone for his own thoughtlessness, he affected to be cheerful and friendly; and, when he wrote to me, it was to prove that he felt nothing, to keep him silent; and nothing to make his pen treacherous to himself or to me.—That letter, I sent to you. Your answer came, nearly at the same time, with another from him.—another, that almost drove me mad. What was I to do? I had still enough of my native character left, to take a resolution; and to carry it into effect, on the spot, though it ruptured every blood-vessel within me. —I wrote to thee, Juliet;—and to him,—to him, as I thought, for the last time. I felt sick—and I felt a melancholy pleasure that I was:—the time might come, thought I, when, he—for I thought only of him— you were forgotten, Juliet—and my heavenly Father was forgotten, in my humiliation,—when he might weep for me, as for one untimely perishing. There was a sweet, dangerous consolation, in the thought. An answer came. I read it. I shook with affright. I felt myself accountable for whatever might happen. I wrote to the mad-man, to stay his hand, until my next letter arrived.—He obeyed me;—and, when the post came in—instead of the letter, he received me— me—to his bosom; sick, even unto death, and terrified, almost to dissolution.—His countenance was death struck.-I stood in the street.-I know not if I were recognised—I care not:—all that I know is, that I found him alive:-and that, when I put my lips to his hand—it was in the street, Juliet,—I would have died there willingly —that they might have grown to it. I stood quaking before him. His lips quivered. He threw his cloak round me—and asked me where, in the name of heaven, we should go.—I cared not—I told him so—I was ready to go any where with him.—“No”—said he—affectionately. “No, Sarah, though you forget yourself--- I will not forget you.” The rebuke went to my heart. It was cold, though tender. But it was the rebuke of a brother, more than that of a lover.---I could not bear it--- I burst into tears.---I believe, that I fainted---at all events, I know that I was insensible; for, when I opened my eyes, I was sitting by a fire,---a snug little family of quakers about me, and Randolph was holding my hands, ---and the room was full of camphor and spirit. I was quite ill that night; and I saw no more of him, until the next morning. But he sent to enquire for me.--- In the evening, we came to an explanation. He loves me---I am sure that he loves me:---and I glory in it!--- glory in it?---glory in the love of a married man!--- * * * Am I not fallen, indeed!---O, Juliet, Juliet, pity me.---He fell upon his knees.---He besought me to forgive him, and forget him;---and, when he discovered how deeply he had injured me,---I thought that he would go distracted upon the spot.---Some strange, mysterious words escaped him;---and his forehead quaked, as with the passing of an apparition.—He took my hands—he held them like a dying man.— “The power of blood is upon me!” said he. “I meant only—what was innocent—or, at least, I meant not to be guilty;—but I have broken into thy heart, Sarah, and there is no more sleep for it, on earth.—I can never marry thee.—I speak plainly. There is no time for trifling; no—I can never marry thee, never!—But—I love thee. I never meant to tell thee this. I fled from thee, to avoid it.—And I tell it now, only to comfort thee, in thy humiliation and bereavement.—'Tis only of late, that I knew it myself.” “Why, Randolph?”—yes, Juliet, I had even the indelicacy, shame on me!—to ask him why he could not marry me. “There are two reasons,” he answered, gasping for breath—“two: one only of which I can tell thee—the other must die with me, in all probability.—I am a married man.” O---Juliet!---that was the blow that I wanted!---that was it!---I thought that I should never breathe again. The blood stopped in my temples, all at once; and--- and---and here I am---what say you to the tale?---am I mad, or not? Is there any comfort; any hope for me?--- May I not pray for death?---Randolph has left me. He has gone to your neighbourhood.---Why did you ever leave this city?---He will see you probably---nay---he has promised to see you.---O, in mercy, write to me.---I care not what it be; but write to me,---if it be only to say that you abandon me forever! S. R.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">JULIET, IN REPLY. Come to me, immediately, Sarah; immediately, if you have life enough left; or, if you are so ill that you cannot come, let me be informed by the return post; and I will go to you, weak and fearful as I am. You may depend upon this. Mr. John Omar has left town; or I should send him to you; and his brother, who is daily expected, has not yet arrived. Come to me, Sarah! my sister! and, on your life, do not see Randolph again: I cannot reason with thee, my dear Sarah,—dearer to me than ever, for thy sorrow and suffering, and penitence. I know how to feel for thee. I can understand it all—all! thy contrition, horrour and amazement. I shall expect my sister every hour. JULIET.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SARAH TO JULIET. Yes, I will come, Juliet; nothing but death, or an illness next to death, shall keep me from thee;—but, on one condition alone—one, that I would not mention, did I not know that your own husband has, in a measure, put his wife into the hands of the spoiler—pardon me— my antipathy, aversion are wonderful—you know whom I mean, I will not even write his name;—but we must never meet—promise me that. That will determine me. Randolph too—he is near you. Remember that; can I come? SARAH.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SPENCER RANDOLPH TO SARAH RAMSAY. New York.— It is time, my excellent friend, that we make some effort to recover our self possession. There is only one way. We must be occupied. Nothing else can save us. And yet more, we must voluntarily encounter some shocks....some shivering....some chilliness of the heart; that we may be the better able to meet, hereafter, by accident. Be the first trial mine. I sit down to write to you, dear woman, as if nothing had happened---nothing to interrupt the friendly intercourse, in which we persisted so long. Let us not think of the past, Sarah;— nor of the future. We must gather up our strength; and bind up our loins or perseverance and trial. Passion, and the passionate remembrance of the time, that is gone, are all to be trodden under foot. Are you able to do this? You are. Am I—?—yes, Sarah—I am. Whatever I set my heart upon, I can do, be it what it may. My conscience will not sleep—it will not:—and there is but one way to appease it; a long life of virtue and self-denial. Mine cannot be a long life; but it shall be one of virtue; or I will perish, by my own hand.— Mark me—I know what I say. I have been nearly driven to despair, once—not so much of myself, as of others. If I ever be again, I will not survive it, for an hour. I am determined. You seem to understand that I am—nay, we will not return to the past. I arrived here yesterday, completely worn out; and, after a few hours rest, went abroad. I like the place, very much. Nay, I have already found a person, who has been very polite and attentive, to inform me about your friend Mrs. Grenville. It appears that her husband vol. ii. R 2 has gone abroad, for his health; and that she is in a very precarious and delicate state. I imagine that this must be the same lady. Was she ever remarkable for her voice, in singing. This lady was; and the gentleman, who gave me this information, seems to be one of the greatest enthusiasts in the world. He says that there was nothing on this earth like her voice, in a large room. It was a silver bugle—full of thrilling and incessant intonation—and never exhausted. In a small room, there was nothing very remarkable in it;—for it lost a great part of its expression and tenderness—and all its touching modulation, then;—and, he added, that he knew many ladies, with a greater knowledge of musick —and two, certainly, who sang, with more passion and feeling—and several, with more brilliancy and science, in company: but never—and he has heard all the singers of Europe—never, any one, whose tone was so pure, sweet, powerful and interminable,—when properly brought out, as hers. Is it the same lady? There is another person—but I must not name his name to you, I am told. I have great curiosity to see him. Did I not understand from you, that he was married? Such is my impression. But this gentleman says that he is an unsocial, ambitious, haughty fellow, who has been thought a little disordered. Enclosed, are the other scraps of poetry, which I promised to you. It appears that they were written, a long time since, in the common-place books of certain young ladies; perhaps hastily; and the copies have been strangely mutilated in their multiplication. There are some rich thoughts in them, I confess; yet, I should never have read them a second time, but for the name of the author, which I knew was a spell to conjure up the devil with, in one heart at least. What think you of them? Hath his head been anointed, lawfully; and hath he been fairly entitled to take his seat among the bards?—not, surely, if these be a fair specimen of his power. Some parts are very childish:---rhymes bad---poured and board---were and there—gone and alone. POETRY, ENCLOSED TO —. Ah, there is inspiration yet, In Woman's smile; But more within her eye, when wet, And glittering, like some jewel set, In trembling dew, awhile. Still more, in lip of bleeding red; Or forehead, full and high, outspread Above a drooping lid; Or in the full, full heart—and though? Transparent, like a spirit, caught— In gauze and vapour hid. Yet—after all, the loveliest beam E'er shed below, By Beauty in her passion-dream, Is darkness, to the blinding stream Of frank eyes in their flow. The next, it is said, was written for a woman, whom I have seen:—and never was poetry so foolishly mis-applied: of this, it would appear that he became, in a measure, sensible; for, on the next leaf, are written the subsequent verses, for an atonement. I could see that she was a very uncommon woman; and such is her reputation. TO —. O Woman! thou'rt a lovely ray; Shining athwart our pilgrim-way, All mystery and light! That, while we turn our eyes to heaven, To thank it, for the raying given, Is gone!—and we are left in night. A rainbow thou, of tinted air, As faint and dim, as if it were, But painted on the pale blue day, To keep our thought forever there, In love, and tenderness, and prayer; Yet—vanishing—in tears—away. Yea, Woman—thou'rt a glittering flower, Evolving in our hermit-bower, Weeping and breathing all around thee; Yet—while we're stooping to caress thee, Scorched by the lips of flame, that bless thee, Art ashes!—ere we've fairly found thee! TO —, THE SAME, IN ATONEMENT. Forgive me—I have done thee 'wrong; Ye are not all that wayward thing; The misty light of youthful song; The dust upon an insect-wing. No, no!—a woman may endure, Though she be bright as heaven's own how; Though glittering, pale, and cold and pure, As flowrets that in grottos blow. She may outlast the god of day, And all the stars of evening too; Burn on, unquenchably, foraye; Set deep in everlasting blue. The following, I have been told some pleasant things about. Of several copies that I have met with, no two are alike; yet I am assured that this came from his own hand. To be sure, there is no great merit in it; but I have obtained it, as corroborative evidence of his character; and think it, for its own sake, worth preserving. HYMN. SUPPER. Our Father! we approach thy board, Like children that would be forgiven: Remembering him, thy Son, who poured His blood for all beneath the heaven. Once more, our Saviour! we arise, And stretch our hands, to touch thy bread; And taste the wine, with streaming eyes; And humble hearts, and faltering tread. O Thou! whose awful front was bowed, In thine unspeakable distress, To God, for us—we call aloud, On thee, in this our helplessness! Beseeching thee, our Saviour, still To be our mediator, where, The men that died on Calvary's hill, With thee, are round thy God, in prayer. WHAT IS AN ALBUM? Say ye, who know, and have the power, To tell what ye may know, What is an Album?—'tis a flower— It is the sunbeam in the shower— Of wavering tint like tulip blow; All ruddy here, with joy and light; There purpled o'er with sorrow— There crimson, blue and gold unite; The sunset of the heart!—like night, When coloured with the morrow! With there a spot of trembling paint, That changes while 'tis gazed on, An emblem of the heart-complaint— Like midnight fruit that, cold and faint, Grows ruddy when 'tis blazed on. And here are tints of silken hue, All running in together; Shifting forever in the view, Like billows in their sea of blue; Or young Love's nodding feather: There Genius blazes—like the light, By constellations given; And there Stupidity, like night, Or wind, when watery skies are bright, Clouds all the fairy heaven! EXPRESSION. There are hearts that love the unchangeable dye, And passionless hue, of a tame blue eye; And worship a brow that is ever serene, Like the lifeless sky of a painted scene, Where the sun-shine sleeps, and the clouds are still; And motionless gushes the mountain rill: Such eyes are too steady too patient, too true; I love not their sleepy, inanimate hue— But give me the glance with the soul in its rays; The brow that can frown, and the eye that can blaze: The smile of that brow is forever the lightest, As a flash from a dark-cloud is ever the brightest: For onem my dear girl, is the still, bright lake, That winds cannot ruffle, and storms cannot shake; The other!—the foam of the cataract-dash— The darker the water, the brighter the flash.** ** Artfully managed—and full of beautiful illustration—language inadequate; and consonants altogether too numerous.—Ed. TO — Nay, wouldst thou but write, for a moment, for me, How hallowed would be the page! I'd peruse it forever, still thinking of thee, While the leaf rolled in light, as evolving to see, How thy spirit could mine engage: To mother of pearl, the leaf should turn; The writing, to jewel-flame; And rubies and sapphires, together burn, Where'er thou hadst written thy name: And, would'st thou remember the days that are flown, When alone, at night, thou weepest; While I turned to that page, where 'twas burning alone, With feeling the purest and deepest: O, the hours that have gone, like the zephyrs away, When our spirits were purest and lightest. Would return with our thought, and around us play, With pinions—the quickest and brightest— Then wilt thou not write, but a moment for me; Thrice blessed would be the endeavour![15] [15] Zounds—what a plunge for a rhyme,—E.d. In my musing, twould come, coloured deeply of thee, With the page curling bright, as delighted to be, So dwelt on, forever and ever! And to mother of pearl, the leaf should turn; And the margin should tremble with gold: An emerald wreath should around it burn; And blossoms of fire unfold!— Farewell, Sarah, farewell! and let me entreat you to keep me informed of your health.—Can I do anything for you, here? My business will detain me longer than I expected.— Your friend, forever, RANDOLPH.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">AMBITION.[16] [16] Altogether better and bolder poetry.—Ed. I've loved to hear the war-horn cry; And panted at the drum's deep roll; And held my breath, when, flaming high, I've seen our starry banners fly, As, challenging the haughty sky, They went, like battle, o'er my soul: For I was so ambitious then, I burned to be—the slave of men. I've stood and seen the morning light— A standard swaying far and free; And loved it, like the conquering flight Of angels, floating wide and bright Above the storm, above the fight Where nations warred for Liberty; And thought I heard the battle cry Of trumpets in the hollow sky: I've sailed upon the dull blue deep, And shouted to the eaglet soaring; And hung me from a rocking steep, When all but spirits were asleep; And O, my very soul would leap, To hear the gallant waters roaring! For every sound and shape of strife, To me was but the breath of life: But, I am strangely altered now; I love no more the bugle voice— The rushing wave—the plunging prow The mountain, with his clouded brow— The thunder, when the blue skies bow, And all the sons of God rejoice— I've learned to dream of tears and sighs, And shadowy hair, and timid eyes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">JULIET TO SARAH. Why did you not come on, at once, Sarah? You have nothing to fear, nothing in the world, I assure you, about him. I never see him; and, although he have authority to visit me, yet he is wise enough never to use it, even on business, except in the presence of a third person. I cannot deny that such delicacy has raised him, a good deal, in my estimation; nay, my dear Sarah, I will go further, for I ought, in justice to an injured man—I believe that you wrong him; that I have wronged him; nay, that he has deserved little of the cruelty and unkindness, which he has met with, in this world. But that is all. I cannot say another word in his favour. Pray, compose[17] [17] Altogether better and bolder poetry.—Ed. yoursef, dear; and lose not an hour in making good your promise. I want your company, at this time, more than that of any living creature, except my husband.---- Come to me, Sarah. We have enough to forgive, and enough to be forgiven; and we may be happier, in weeping together, than, in this life of apprehension, apart.--- Fear nothing for him---though there be no chance of his visiting me, without notice; yet, to make that perfectly sure, I will address a note to him, the moment that you arrive, requesting him to transact all his business with me, thereafter, by writing. He will understand me.--- And now, farewell, my dear Sarah---my sister---my friend. Take comfort; and all will be well, yet. We shall live and be happy, in our compassion for the infirmities of each other. I am much better in spirits to-day, than I have been for a long while. My husband's vessel has been spoken with—“all well,” they say—and I feel, almost, as if I had been pressed to his bosom. And yet, such dreams! —so desolate!—so dark!—O, Sarah, I shall not be happy, for an hour, till thou art with me, to cheer up my widowhood; and help me to sustain the agony that is approaching, with every blow of the clock. JULIET.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">MOLTON TO STAFFORD. I hasten to answer the rest of your letter; as I promised. No—we have no “dramatists”---no “architects”—no “sculptors”---no “musicians”---no “tragedians.” And why? It is not for want of natural genius. There is enough of that among my countrymen. It is for the want of encouragement, riches, a crowded population, luxury, and corruption. These arts are of the last, to which a people turn their attention. And when we turn ours to them, we shall succeed, as we have, in everything else, to which we have applied our hand, seriously. I know of more than one man, at this moment, who is capa ble of writing a great drama. We have many builders, who have studied architecture, and would excel, if they could feed themselves and their families upon the cameleon diet, meanwhile. But we have not even a pretender to sculpture. One Spaniard,[18] [18] No—Capellano is an Italian.—Ed. (Capellano,) a man of great talent---simple and severe---and two or three Italians, have been among us, of considerable merit; but we have no native Americans. Sig. Causici, a pupil of Canova, starving at Washington, under the bounty of a whole people, is a man of extraordinary genius; but God forgive the men that abuse it. They employed him to make a colossal statue of Liberty: that is, they authorized him to make one, probably, at his own risk. He made a stupendous cast; and was preparing his mind for an immortal labour, when he was prevented, by a touch of the annual epidemick---economy. But, what did the great men at Washington? I'll tell you. They watched an opportunity, when he was away; tore down his workshop, (for the statue was too large to be taken out of the door;) carried off the plaster model; and elevated it, to a place of permanent occupation, over the Speaker's head, in the House of Representatives; where it is yet to be seen, an everlasting libel on our nation. The artist had well nigh gone distracted. He told me, himself, that he would have cut his own throat, but for the hope of being employed in some work, that would redeem his own reputation; and shame them and their posterity, forever. He is a fine looking fellow, with large, clear, hazel eyes, light brown hair, full of fire and energy; and looks far more like a German, than like an Italian. He came from Verona. His Baron de Kalb, a little figure about ten inches high, is the most truly elegant and vital piece of sculpture, that I ever saw. He made it, in consequence of another hint from the nation, only as a model for a full length statue, designed for the Baron, by Congress; which design, ended with the aforesaid hint. He has more genius, by far, than Trentenova, or Capellano; the latter of whom has more power, but is rather a grave and serious workman---remarkable for a certain majesty of deportment and cold dignity, in his statuary. As for musick, it would be ridiculous for us to think of such a thing. It is only fit for an idle and dissolute people; and I never see a man play well upon any instrument, or hear him sing a good song, without recalling the kingly rebuke of Philip to Alexander, who had just finished playing, divinely, on a flute. Are you not ashamed, said Philip, to play so well? No, Stafford, I feel no histility to musick; but I would not see any American, any republican, distinguished for it. It is the growth of corruption; the spontaneous issue and yielding of nations in their decay. Yet, I can relish our sweet, simple, Scotch and Irish melodies; and when I hear Mrs. French, the very blood of my heart bubbles, to her incantation, like a fountain. You have never heard of her, perhaps. She is an honour to her sex; and though I love her singing, for its passionate, sweet modulation, in “Down the Burn Davie, love,” and such old-fashioned airs, yet there are others who cheer her to idolatry, for her Italian flourishes and flings. Stafford, I cannot endure it. I cannot bring myself to admire anything, merely for its difficulty; and when I heard Madame Catalini, (whose shake and trill, by the way, are not a whit better than Mrs. French's, except in their occasionally brilliant and rapid variety.) though she took my breath away with her execution, yet she never touched my heart. I could not help thinking of Rousseau's criticism upon the French musick. The French and the English, said he, are both ignorant of musick; but the mischief of it is, that the former will not acknowledge it, and do not know it. They affect to criticise all Europe---and the only notion that they have of it, is, that it consists in violent transition and loudness. Thus, she, who can squall the longest and loudest, is sure to be most applauded at the French opera, no matter how much sympathy she may excite by her contortions; and, in the orchestra, the only peculiarity that I can remember, is, that the whole band run, one after the other, like so many cows gallopping, or fat geese learning to fly—after a leader. Somewhat of a caricature, I confess, Stafford, even at the time that he wrote in; and I confess, also, that some of the late French operas have been translated in Germany and Italy. But what does that prove?---the vol. ii. S advance of the French? I fear not. It may, with equal probability, prove the degeneracy of the German and Italian school. And this, I am inclined to believe, is the case—for, it is the nature of refinement, to evaporate, at a certain elevation. And the artificial beauty; the exquisite delicacies and difficulties of their musick, have been continually approximating to that point, for the last fifty years. A man must be a professor, to relish some of their commonest, and simplest productions. But, play one of their learned, or brilliant ones, to a congregation of Americans; and they would think the performers mad—mad as march hares. To their ears, it is the crash of broken glass; and the wailing of bruised animal. How different is it, with our simple Scotch melodies! I have seen a Choctaw Chief shed tears at Bonny Doon—but that was before it had been manufactured into a duett; and bespattered with Italian touches. I hate these gew-gaws, and this splendid rubbish; and, though I recommend the practice of Italian, for the same reason that I would bid a man, that had to carry a certain weight of armour continually, to practise, now and then, in a heavier suit, leaping and wrestling in it—yet, my reason would be, not that he should spend his life in leaping and wrestling; but that he might be more at his ease, more graceful and dignified, in the armour that was made for him. And when I see a sweet girl, with lips just thrilling, as if a live coal, from Apollo's own altar had touched them, and a heart gushing out with melody; when I see her mingling the graces of the Italian, with the dear Scotch, and Irish minstrelsy—my fingers itch to be at her. I pity her; her nature is abused; and her heart is corrupted—as much, as if she wore paint and patches, and the false jewelry of an Italian opera girl. But why does she this?—why?—who are her masters? That will explain the mystery. They are either Frenchmen or Germans; full of passion, real or affected, for the Italian school; or Italians themselves; all of whom mock at, and scorn, as with something of a constitutional, and political, hatred and derision, the sweet simplicity of our only national musick—nay, not musick, melody.—It is not even harmony. As a matter of art, these teachers are right. There is no science in these melodies. But who was ever touched, to the core of his heart, by science? There are some things, such as eloquence, poetry, and singing, where science is detestible. I want not to be dazzled nor astonished, at all times. I ask only to be moved, agitated—to delirium, if you please; and science can never do that—it is like the flourish of a white pocket-handkerchief, in a speaker, to apprise you, seasonably, of his design to be pathetick. No—Nature is direct.— Her eloquence is of the blood—the crowded sky—the thought breaks upon you, clap after clap, till your whole nature is disordered. Call up a mother, who has just lost her infant—bid her tell the story—look at her—study her. There is no wearying preparation. She repeats the same thing, over and over again, a hundred times.— There is no poetry; no play of the imagination, in what she says. There is not even the simplest observance of rule—her sentences are short—broken—exclamatory— familiar---colloquial—vulgar, it may be, and ungrammatical. But your tears follow---and your heart heaves to it. Can you improve it? Take it home---dress it up into an oration---dramatize it—and lo! the essence, that volatile and penetrating spirit, which, from the broken hearted mother, set all your arteries weeping, that has escaped! Nay, go to the blacksmith, at his anvil; the farmer at his plough; put him upon his trade. He is forcible and direct. Has he been wronged? mark his gesture---his eyes---his hands---the variation of its countenance and voice. That man is eloquent. For, what is eloquence? It is the power of convincing. And he, only, is truly eloquent, who can convince, right or wrong. Captivation is another thing---a fool may captivate; but it takes a giant to convince. But more of this, by and by, when I come to speak of our orators. Just so, it is with musick. I cannot endure what is artificial in it. I love only what is natural. But what is natural? That were difficult to tell. It is what is simple, continued, and gentle. Such are the notes of a bird. Certain notes are continually recurring. At any rate, if I may not define what is natural, I can easily tell what is not. The Italian musick is not. It is the very definition of what is not. Our NOVELISTS—You have frequently spoken of them, with emphasis. We have no such thing with us.—I know not why it is; but the trade of novel writing has been of late, as if by common consent, relinquished by men of genius and power, to women and children; and if, now and then, a tolerable affair comes out, like these late Scotch novels, all the world seems to run mad after it.—It is surely not well considered, this thing. Is it Stafford? There is no class of literature, which may be made to have; nay which has, in reality, such an influence—upon society;—and, if a man, who had the strength and vividness, of a dramatist, and a poet, were called upon to reflect and to choose, that mode of writing, which would be most likely, if he were truly powerful, to give him the widest theatre for a display of that power, it is my deliberate opinion that he would choose a novel;—and yet, in whose hands do we find this body of our literature?—In the feeble of heart—and the faint of spirit-the gossipping and childish. Now and then, it is true, a Godwin will break the seals, and invoke the genii to ascend; but it is with an uncertain aim; and as if he were not proud of the office. So too, there is a Maturin—he might do well; but he is haunted by the spirit of Byron, and the devil himself, at the same time. Such men are out of their element—novels might be made, yet, full of distinctness; full of reality, yet carrying the marvellous in every page. But in our country, there is every thing to discourage a novelist—nothing to incite him. The very name of having written a novel—although the wise and reflecting acknowledge, that no literature hath such an influence upon our language, and manners—none such fascination,—for, in its witchery, it surpasses the stage— and is read, secretly, by them that read nothing else— and them that are not permitted to visit the theatre—and none so wants to be purged and purified—yet the very name of a novel writer would be a perpetual reproach to a man of genius.—Would that some one would arise! and laugh to scorn, the presumption and folly, of this doc trine—and trample it under his feet! What is to prevent him, even in America? We have no old castles— no banditti—no shadow of a thousand years to penetrate —but what of that. We have men, and women—creatures that God himself hath fashioned and filled with character. And what more do we want? By heaven, Stafford, if I had the power, I would, myself, set about the work, before I slept:—I would take up the tale, with the events of this very day—and I would dare to say, to them that, questioned me.—Lo! here is a proof, that we want no traditions—no antiquity—nothing but tolerable power, to tell you a tale that shall thrill to your marrow—and that too, without borrowing from anybody, or imitating anybody.—You laugh at my enthusiasm. I am sure of it. But why need we go back to the past for our heroes?—There is no such necessity; and he who shall first dare to grapple with the present, will triumph, in this country. Remember, my prediction. Another very serious reason why, whatever were the merit of our writers, we could not enter into competition with the men of Europe is, that we cannot afford to write for nothing; and yet, if we would write for nothing; and give the copy right of a novel, for instance, to a publisher, it would still be a perilous adventure to him. Shall I tell you the reason? Our booksellers here can publish your costliest poems, and novels, and dramas, without any expense for the copy-right. You give Byron or Moore five thousand guineas [19] [19] Five thousand guineas!—fudge!—Ed. for a poem; and, in forty days, there will be an American edition published here, for the copy right of which, our publishers have not given a cent. Names will sell anything. We all know that. Here is a poem, for example, of Walter Scott, for sale in Philadelphia, at this moment, called Hallidon Hill, which, I venture to say, has not been read, by twenty people in the city. And yet, the time was, when the man who should have predicted such a thing, would have been hooted at for a fool, or a madman. Then, Walter Scott was, “the greatest poet in the world.”— vol. ii. S 2 Now, he is not thought of, as a poet. Then, he had a name—now, he has no name at all—as a poet. The consequence, you will perceive, of this practice in our country, is, that, until the authors, or publishers of European works, have the wisdom to take out copy-rights in this country, their reputation will be at our mercy; they will be subject to all sorts of bookselling piracy and trick; they will get nothing of the vast profit, that is obtained here, by the sale of their works; and our native authors cannot contend with them for a day; because, it is more profitable for a bookseller, in America, to re-publish established works, of established authors, when the publick in England have already past judgment upon them, and there is therefore no risk in re-publishing them here, than to publish native works, though they be made a present of the copy-right. But will this last forever? No. The time is rapidly approaching, when, it will be enough to sell a work, if it be called American. We are getting to feel a national pride; and men are already beginning to put in their title pages, “by an American”—and “an American Tale” —words, that, a few years ago, would have been as politick, as “by a Choctaw”—or “or a Narraganset tale.” You have heard of Charles Brockden Brown. Your reviewers, two or three years ago, took into their heads to call him a great novelist. He deserves the name. Yet we, his countrymen, never knew it. He lived and died in obscurity. His works, which amounted to about ten or a dozen volumes, are not to be found in America; or, rather American editions of them are not to be found. In every publick library, to be sure. London editions are to be had. Whenever his name is mentioned here, at this time, you hear it accompanied with some proud epithet; and yet, he is literally unknown to us. Few, even of our literary men have read him; although our North American Review, very gallantly, undertook his resuscitation—but how? —feebly enough—and when?---not till he had undergone an apotheosis, at London. There is our courage. A native author, over whose grave we have been walking for twenty years, without any emotion, has been dug up, and embalmed abroad---and lo, we have to go to another people even yet, to understand who, or what he was. We call him great, not because we have read him---not because he was great; but, because foreign Reviewers have called him so.---Oh, we are a base and treacherous people—base to the reputation of our fathers; and treacherous to the inheritance of our children. We suffer all men to dictate us—in that empire, where God never meant man to be dictated to,—in the empire of genius. Shall I give you my notion of Brown? I will. But first, let me inform you, that he wrote piece-meal, for the periodical papers of the day; and that, his tales were often issued, one volume at a time, by different publishers; so that you can find an interval of several years between the first and second volume of some. Brown was too much addicted to Godwin. That was the greatest fault. But he was altogether superiour to Godwin, in the appaling distinctness of that manner, by which he made very trifling incidents of importance enough to occupy your whole heart and soul, for many pages. Like Godwin, he sought to make you think with him—accompany him—at every step. He was not content with telling a story to an audience—he acted it. His novels are not so much narratives, as they are dramas—long, continued soliloquies, which you are made to overhear, in your participation. He is daringly improbable; and continually forgetful of what is past. Events occur without any order or design—he affects to explain them, and yet he leaves you, as in Wieland, with a feeble, teasing dissatisfaction at your heart, as if you had been listening to one that could not get himself out of a scrape, except by affronting your good sense, or by remaining obstinately silent. This might be well, if there were any dignity about the feeling; but there is not.— It is not a yearning to know, what is to become of such and such a character; or how such an incident took place; but merely a kind of self reproach, that you have been held in thraldom so long, with so little art. Occasionally too, a simple incident, will occur so frequently, and be made so much of, as to excite a suspicion of its reality. Thus, in Clara Howard, I believe; and in Ormond; and in Edgar Huntly, there is the same bill of exchange and misapplication of money, with much the same reflections. The incident is too natural; and the pertinacity of the author suspicious. It not only leads one to doubt his invention, but to believe that, some such incident must have happened to himself, in reality; for men are apt to make their own calamities, a little more conspicuous, than they ought to be. I could mention some other faults of the same kind; but it gives me more pleasure to think of his excellencies; contrary to my general rule, which is, to look for the bad in what is good; and, for the good, in what is bad—for faults, in the work of a master; and for beauties, in the labour of inferiour genius. My first canon in criticism, is to discover, if I can, what was the object of the artist. Till I have discovered that, I am dumb. If he have done what he attempted, he must be praised, whatever were his attempt. We may dislike his taste; condemn his judgment; but, we cannot pretend to say, that he has not that—which, of itself, is greatness —the power to do what he undertakes. It is hard to condemn a man for not doing, what be never attempted. By this canon, let us try Brown. He attempts only to agitate, for a time. He succeeds. He has no poetry in his heart—or, at least, nothing that the world mistake for poetry, the beautiful and pathetick:—the tender or dazzling: but he is altogether compounded of the distinct and earnest; the expressive and terrible in morals. He is never humorous—never rhetorical—never splendid; he never attempts the descriptive, except it be the descriptive in passion, which he shows, rather by its effect; and in its meditation, than by any detail. He is generally mild, and thoughtful; or profound, and direct; but, often very sedate, and very dull. Extraordinary things occur continually, for no other purpose, it would seem, than that the author might make his hero meditate aloud, for a time, upon the mystery:—and this propensity Brown was undoubtedly led into, by his love of Godwin and his Caleb Williams; but he forgot that, throughout that admirable novel, there is a continuity of design, which will not permit you to doubt the scope of any incident, however trivial. What Brown might have been, but for Godwin, it were easy to say. He would have been only a narrator of marvellous tales, chiefly remarkable for plain, direct management, and a tone of serious conviction, as if he believed what he was saying. What he would have been, after having his mind imbued with the dark, and beautiful waywardness of Godwin, whose faculty of making trifles momentous and tragical; and improbabilities probable, was never equalled by any other man, if he had not yielded himself too unreservedly, in his admiration of him; and become an imitator in all his forcible works, it would have been no difficult matter to foretel. He would have been one of the few great novel writers that the world has ever seen. No one would have had a more distinct and formidable character. No one would have dealt more unqualifiedly, or more unsparingly, with the terrible and the dramatick. As it is—Charles Brockden Brown does not deserve his present reputation.— His Clara Howard and Jane Talbot are paltry tales, distinguishable only from the mass of such productions, by a more thoughtful tone, and heavier probability. His Edgar Huntly is a tissue of agitating adventures, put together in patch work, with amazing talent at times; and, again, at other times, with a slovenly and shameful indifference. His Ormond, or the Secret Witness, does not correspond at all with the title. One would believe that he had written the work, without having once thought of title; and that, then, he had put in a little note containing the only incident, where anything like a Secret Witness may be found, merely as a kind of justification for the title. His Arthur Mervyn and Wieland have some awful features in them—but they are frightfully indistinct; and his principal character is always the same---always Carwin---always an adventurer---and always doing what you cannot expect. Thus, the hero of Arthur Mervyn, we are led to believe at one time, will prove to have been the schoolmaster, who many years before, had destroyed Arthur's own sister. There cannot be the least doubt, that it was the intention of Brown to follow up the hint, at the time; but he forgot it, when he took up the tale again; and has left us to complain of his having invaded the unity of his own design, and forgotten his own purpose, in a very childish manner. But let me forbear. You perhaps have heard of the Spy. There is another imitator. The author has fallen so much into the manner of the Scot, that, if there were some good tedious Scotch dialogue in it, few people would he able to detect the counterfeit. It is a very good novel; but they are making such a fuss about it here, that we shall become ridiculous abroad, when they come to read it, where the Scotch Pedlar, in the Antiquary (the original of the Spy,) has been before. The Spy, like the Pedlar, is omnipresent; always appearing when not expected—nor wanted. Some parts are capital—the death of the Skinner—the character of the Irish woman; some of her dialogue; the escape of Wharton, after he gets into the saddle:—and some points in the men of Virginia. But, as in the Waverly writer, there is a distressing barrenness of invention; and no poetry at all. The two principal characters escape from death, by a similar expedient; one, in the disguise of an old woman; and the other in that of a negro; and that too, from the centre of an armed camp, with watchful sentinels all about. Whenever the author is in a scrape, too, he sets fire to the chief mansion house—or introduces General Washington—as if, just on the point of doing some very foolish thing—and deterred from it, page after page, by some impertinent trick of authorship, to prolong the tale, and protract the catastrophe; just as if his manuscript had fallen short of his contract with the printer—and then: too, Washington—George Washington is profanely introduced; and always profanely employed, in situations totally unworthy of him—perilous—foolish—and ridiculously mysterious;—and the Spy is made to outlive the times—and fight and die in the war of 1812—which was another after thought. Every thing is done for effect. Some fine incidents occur; but they are too often clap traps, stage incidents. A woman, for example, is shot through the heart—and dies, the Lord knows why. It does not help the catastrophe, except that it lightens the obligation of the author, who has no talent in the pathetick, or passionate, though a good deal in the humorous, and an uncommonly fine one, in the descriptive—not of the human heart, but of nature—and the individual things—of nature. The Spy too, when hunted for his life, is made to fire at people, and then throw away his gun, merely to terrify them: to sit upon a rock, and eat chinquipin berries within pistol shot, almost, of his mortal enemies—to talk wildly about his father, without telling us why, although great interest is excited—and we are made to expect an important result; and finally, to destroy a protection given to him by Washington, at the very moment when it was to be used—aye, when that case of mortal emergency had arrived, which was the only object of the protection, where nothing else could save him—the Spy—merely that he might utter a few mysterious words, and make a stage flourish, pulled it out of his pocket, and swallowed it. —Such tricks are contemptible. The author, I hope, will never repeat them. He has good talent, as I have already said—but he must not believe what the people tell him of it. It is not a great talent—and never will be. He wants originality—passion—poetry—and eloquence. His Precaution, the first of his novels, no mortal, but a critick, could get through with. It is a tedious, intertangled, boarding school tale. His Pioneers (by the way, I would have you remark the order of these productions— Precaution—the Spy—the Pioneers—and the Pilot—one would believe that he meant to lead his countrymen into an enemy's territory,) which is just abroad, has disappointed the sensible and “thinking people” prodigiously. The first volume is mere stuff— laboriously beaten out; but the second is very good. Most of the characters of the Spy are repeated. And some, under the same names. Sergeant Hallester and wife, for instance;--and then, there is the same old maid; and the yankee, from Connecticut, in both—and the same negro in both:—and one character taken from Brace-Bridge Hall (I mean the character, if it may be called one, of Mr. Jones, who is the identical bachelor of Irving,) and another compounded from Rip Van Winkle, and the vagabond itinerant; the former of which Irving, himself, borrowed, or stole from an old German tale, which I remember. There is a battle too, surprisingly after the fashion of Irving in Knickerbocker, to avoid bloodshed. There is a Frenchman, however, in the Pioneers, who talks not only broken English, but broken French enough, to convince you that the author is not at all familiar with the French; and a Sailor, whose character is well supported; but whose language is a compilation of sea phrases;—and both appear to have been made up, without understanding their application, from some wretched vocabulary. Elizabeth is a fool—Miss Grant, who was meant to be the heroine, is let alone, at last, in a laughable, author-like way, as if she were forgotten. But there are some capital things in it--capital. The fire on the mountain, which, to be sure, is too exceedingly like the sea-shore escape in the Antiquary—where, for the Beggar, we are to read the Indian Leatherstocking;—the death of the catamount---the shad fishery, (too like the whale-killing in the Pirate, though)—and the christmas shooting, which is faithful and masterly—and the stag hunt—are equal to any thing in the history of novel writing, for vivid description. They are, to be sure, not overpowering—but they are very distinct; and even sublime, circumstantial, and terrible, now and then. But the best joke, after all, is—and I will put my reputation on the fact (being anonymous!) that the Wilderness, a Tale of Braddock's Times, is another novel by the author of the Spy and Pioneers. I have heard nobody say so. I have never heard it conjectured—but I am sure of it. The style is the same—the chief incidents the same (the death of the catamount and the death of the Indian, after the Rhoderick Dhu school —and the extracting of a ball, two or three times, are the same)—the character the same—an Irishman, who talks tolerable Irish—another, who talks just about as much like a Scot, as the sailor does, like a sailor, in the Pioneers; and a Frenchman, who talks anything but French. How pleasant it is. Mr. Walsh, I dare say, has never read the Wilderness—or, if he have read it, has thought it, what it is, a paltry tale—utterly destitute of merit,—and yet, had the title page borne the legend, “By the author of the Spy,” he would have thought it, no doubt, quite an honour to the country. I say first, that it is—by the author of the Spy. I care not who contradicts me; and I say secondly, that it is better than Precaution—and as good as nine tenths of the Spy and the Pioneers—and in style, precisely the same. So much for a name.— On the whole, however, I am afraid that the author has done himself up; and I feel sure that, if his Pilot be not worth a dozen of the Pioneers and Spy, that he will be overhaled with claws of iron, by his warmest admirers. At present, they expect too much. Of course, they must be disappointed. But the most amusing part is yet to come. I have heard two of these very works attributed to the author of Niagara, Goldau, and Otho, of whom I have already spoken: nay, I have heard a man say, that he knew him to be the author of the Spy. I smiled; because, if I understand that writer's character, he could not have written either of them;—and if his pride and vanity be, what they are said to be, he would never have published them, if he had written them; he would consider them as altogether beneath him. And this reminds me of another report, which, I confess, to be far more probable, that he is the author of Logan and Seventy-six, of which I have already given you my hasty opinion. They have been ascribed to several; but to no one, so generally, or with such pertinacity, as to him. But are they his? Let us examine the evidence. It is conceded that they are both the production of the same person, not so much from any unequivocal internal evidence, as from the fact, that the author of Seventy-six avows himself to be the author of Logan. The reasons that I have heard assigned, in proof that he is the author, are, chiefly, the following:—First, the style:—secondly, the incidents:—thirdly, the general opinion of the publick:----and, fourthly, the fact that he does not deny the authorship. And first, for the style. I admit that the style of this author is very remarkable. And yet, how varied it is. In the length of twenty pages, you will find a variety of different styles; now argumentative, and now declamatory;—now vol.ii. T broken and abrupt, and now, mild, temperate, and well sustained. For myself, I cannot deny, that I like his writing, with all its passion, vehemence, brokenness and extravagance; because, I have persuaded myself, that he, who agitates me, must himself be agitated. But grant, if you will, that his style is very remarkable, and very faulty. Is it not, for that very reason, the more easily imitated? Great peculiarities are easily counterfeited. Lord Byron—Dr. Johnson—M. G. Lewis have been successfully imitated. The profoundest men of the time—criticks—were deceived by Irelands' imitations of Shakspeare. And Bonaparte confessed, that a spurious work, purporting to be written by himself, was so amazingly like him, that it might not only deceive others; but, that there were passages capable of deceiving himself. I can readily believe this. I would undertake to imitate the style of any man, if he be at all remarkable, in prose or poetry, so as to deceive any critick. And this, if you please, my dear Stafford, does not imply any equality; but rather a little ingenuity in the imitator. He has but to seize on the peculiarities of the writer, and obtrude them, continually, in as adroit a manner as he can, to be sure, upon the reader. There never was a greater blockhead than he, who, for a time palmed off certain minor poems upon your publick, and ours, for the poetry of Byron.—The Farewell to England is one of the number, I believe, that yet passes for a genuine Byron. I do not distinctly recollect, but I believe that that is one of several, which passed for Byron's, from the first, and which were avowed by the author, who was an Englishman, in his preface to a volume of wretched stuff that he published in Philadelphia, a year or two ago. Is it safe then, to depend so confidently upon style; particularly where that style is remarkable, chiefly for peculiarities, that are so very easily imitated, as abruptness—boldness and arrogance. As we grow older, do we not become more distrustful of all evidence? Do we not learn that, to copy is one thing; and to imitate, another; and that, even copies, in painting for example, are not infallibly known; and that imitations, by a tolerable artist, of a great master, are far more difficult to detect; and may pass through the whole world for original. How long, for instance, has the world gone on ascribing the Venus de Medicis to Praxitiles,—and yet, we are now beginning to believe that it is not his—and that, all the sculpture, within our reach, is but the workmanship of a degenerate age. Style and manner then, are not to be depended upon, so implicitly, as they would seem to be, at the first glance. Men are unequal. Men of genius are particularly so: consequently, they are more easily imitated—and their imitations are more difficult to detect. The author of Niagara and Otho is, certainly, a man of genius. That will not be denied. Every page is full of inequality, confusion, and darkness. It is easy to be unequal, confused and dark. Logan is remarkably so.—I can take passage after passage from Logan; and compare them together, before your eyes; and you will perceive that they are as unlike each other, as any two things that were ever written. At most, therefore, if you depend upon style, you will be driven to admit that all of Logan, and Seventy-six cannot have been written by the same person—nor by the author of Goldau, and Otho; and Niagara. But let me come to facts. I can refer to several articles in Blackwood's Magazine; and to several in the Monthly Magazine; altogether in a similar style, and particularly to one in the latter, respecting hypochondria, from the use of opium, which appeared simultaneously with Logan, that—if we might depend upon style, and even thought, one might swear was written by the same man; nay, I have heard it almost sworn to, by an acute critick, and an intimate friend of Mr. Neal. And yet—I have good reason to believe that Mr. N. is not the author of any one of them. Well then—we cannot depend upon similarity of style. It proves too much. It is only a circumstance; but, as a circumstance, entitled to great consideration, I admit. The next question is—whether we can depend upon the incidents. Many of them are said to be incidents of his own life:—and the people who know him, pretend to find in it, his own wayward and adventurous journeying, shadowed throughout. Who can believe this? What would be more ridiculous? Yet nothing is more common. I have been gravely informed that the character of Echo in Keep Cool, is a faithful portrait of the author; and seriously assured by one, who knew all the parties well, that all the characters were real; and that Earnest, in the same novel, was drawn by the author, for himself! I would ask what are the incidents in Logan? are they very remarkable? are they known? Certainly— they must be known, or who could recognize them in a novel? Is the author a fool or a madman? The world are divided in their opinion, perhaps. There are many, it is true, who believe him to be both; but I am not of that number. These incidents are known —there can be no doubt of it; and they must be remarkable, or nobody would remember them:—consequently, they are the legitimate property of the publick, and subject to the appropriation of any novel-writer, whatever.—I have heard a good deal of them; and if they be true, it would be rather difficult, I think, for any man to persuade the world, that an author would so far publish his own shame; or so foolishly imitate the notorious Byron, who is always the hero of his own tale, as the world are charitable enough to believe—or to declare, whether they believe it, or not: and last of all, an author so ridiculously extravagant as Mr. Neal, in his love of originality. But remarkable as the incidents in question are— I am told of two facts, that go a good way to destroy my confidence in their testimony. The first is, that, when Lady Morgan's Florence McCarthy appeared, I am assured, that the friends of this very Mr. Neal, found his portrait, in the ridiculous coxcomb, De Vere. I believe this; because I have been told so, by two literary men, who were in habits of intimacy with him. And they both spoke of it, as a portrait. One extraordinary coincidence certainly does appear in that character. De Vere, very unnecessarily, is made to mention his birth day.—Who ever thought of such a thing. It was the twenty-fifth of August.--- It is odd enough that Mr. Neal was born on that very day. De Vere, you know, was a bad drawing of Lord Byron. So too was Glenarvon, which, by the way, in America, has been charged to Mr. N. as one of his productions,---beside being admitted by many, to contain a portrait of him, in the character of the scoundrel, who is the hero. But the best of all is---that, about the time when, it is alleged, that certain transactions occurred in his life, which, for his own sake, he should have been discreet enough, if they have not been misrepresented to me, to keep forever concealed; there was a novel—a pious, dull thing—with some very fine parts in it, called No Fiction—which made its appearance; narrating, with an accuracy, almost too astonishing for belief, if it were accidental, merely, the very same incidents, which are the ground, on which he is charged with the authorship of Logan. And yet—that was accidental, I verily believe. In fact, it must have been so—unless he were the author; or knew of its publication, at least; for, it appeared in London before the transactions occurred in America, which are so exceedingly like a part, that are related in the book. Can we depend now—upon these incidents—or resemblances of character? More remarkable ones have occurred, we see, where there can be no doubt of their having been accidental. But, it is not even necessary to suppose that they were accidental. If I am rightly informed, Mr. N. who is really thought to be a downright madman, with an occasional lucid interval, by many people in the city where he is living—has made no secret of them.— He has spoken and written freely of them, but not ostentatiously, if I may judge by one of his letters, which I have seen. What would have been easier, therefore, than, for another person to introduce them; and colour and exaggerate them; and then—for nothing is more common, vol. ii. T 2 to circulate a report that they were not altogether imaginary, merely to give the work a run: for, we all know, that the obscurity or insignificance, of the unfortunate or wayward, are not always an antidote to the publick appetite for the exciting and uncommon. So far then, we have gone into the examination of the two chief witnesses. Give them all their weight; and, to what do they amount? The style is equivocal; and the incidents publick property; and the coincidences, not so remarkable, as others that were not, and could not have been, other than accidental. Let us now look at the publick opinion. Can we depend upon that? No. The longer we live, the more doubtful we become of our own judgment, in matters of mere taste. Of what weight then, should be the judgment of the mob? I know that they have ascribed many things to people, that never wrote them. I have reason to believe—that Mr. N. has had volumes attributed to him, that he never saw; and that much of his writing has been attributed to other men. So it is, with all authors. Of my own knowledge, I know that he is not the author of one work, that has been ascribed to him; and that he is the author of one more, that is ascribed to another man. This, I happen to know. But why does'nt he deny it! say the world. That were very easy, one would think. But, without seeking to account for his not denying it; I can readily give many reasons, why any man might not deny it. In the first place, in a country like ours, where there are so few authors, and they universally known; it is common to ascribe any new publication, in the newspapers of the day, to one or the other, immediately, on its appearance. In this way, if each take the trouble to deny the authorship, he soon reduces the real author to the necessity of standing alone. A man might regard the work so attributed to him, as beneath his genius; and then, if he were really a man, he would disdain to contradict a report, that would more naturally perish of itself, than by any attempt of his, to destroy it: or, he might think it an honour to him; and, if a vain man, or a mischievous one,—or one that was willing to promote the concealment of the author, he would never deny it. Or—he might really know the author—have contributed, perhaps, a very little to the work—or written the preface—(as I have known to be done, in Allen's Revolution)—or corrected the proofs. On either of which suppositions, he would be held to such a course, as would best avoid publick remark or inquiry—publick newspaper speculation;—for,---when the friend is known—or the corrector of the press—or the writer of the preface, it is no very difficult matter to find the author. The difficulty of concealment then would be immeasurably augmented. Conjecture would amount to certainty. But there is yet another reason, why a man might refrain from denying the authorship of any work. By continually denying whatever was wrongly ascribed to him, he would put it out of his power ever to write anonymously; for, if he should refuse to deny anything, no matter what; to no matter what impertinent questioner---he would be immediately established, as the author: and all would refer for proof to the fact of his uniform denial before, on like occasions. So much for the fact that he does not deny the authorship.[20] [20] And what if he really had something to do with the works,—or were bound to secrecy; —or had an interest in them,—or were employed, as I am, to superintend the printing— would he not be silent?—Ed. But are there not other facts going, indirectly to be sure, but very strongly, to prove that he is not the author? He abandoned poetry some years ago; and, notwithstanding every temptation, has never written any since.—That would argue some self denial. He is very ambitious, I am told; and established, in a lucrative, and respectable practice: is very remarkable for his diligent attention to the science and philosophy of Law —and an indefatigable student. If this be true; and I believe that it is; it is hardly reconcileable with the character of a rash and headlong novel writer, which the author of Logan and Seventy-six, most unquestionably deserves. Stay----I have lately heard something, which I can depend on. Some publick paper once declared that he was the author of Logan, Seventy-six, and some others. I am told, that he laughed when he saw it---and said that no human being lived, who knew him to be the author of any work that he had not avowed, publickly, and unhesitatingly. And the best of all is, that, while his friends are seriously alarmed about the matter, and anxious to vindicate his reputation from the charge of authorship, he gives himself no kind of trouble about the matter; and, I am told, thinks very highly of the works themselves! I have made a tremendous letter to be sure, dear Stafford; it is almost a book; but when I get upon a temperate and agreeable theme, it soothes my blood, and alleviates the unpleasant throbbing of my arteries; and I love to dwell upon it. Perhaps a word or two more, on the character of these novels, may not be amiss. The first is no novel. It is a wild, fiery, protracted dream--a tale--not, perhaps “told by an ideot,” not “signifying” absolutely nothing---but, “full of sound and fury.” It would seem rather a vehicle for the peculiar and daring opinions of the author, than, any connected, and intentional development, of a preconceived design. It is a great void, peopled with phantoms. And when the author wants to terrify you; or provoke you, by any startling paradox, or a discharge of sky rockets, he makes the occasion, heedless of all consequences. The whole book is full of darkness, repetition, anachronism and extravagance. Nobody can read it through, deliberately, as novels are to be read. You feel fagged and fretted to death, long and long before you foresee the termination. It is not dull---nor common place; but it is too exciting. The author won't let you cool off, for a moment, in your ascent. He has you, forever, under whip and spur. We can live, year after year, you know, on bead and water---in literature—as in diet; but we should soon starve upon sweetmeats and cayenne pepper. High seasoned dishes are disagreeable, after a little time, to the jaded appetite. So, with the aliment of the mind. So with Logan. There is material enough; and spice and fire enough in it, for fifty volumes, such as the populace are fond of. The author appears to have written, only, while the fit was upon him; and always to have forgotten, what he had already done; and, finally, to have collected all the loose and flying fragments, and tacked them together, any how—to make a book. To my view, it is rather a great, troubled poem, than a novel—and rather a common place book than either. It is a world in confusion, where, to borrow one of his own thoughts, the fountains of the human heart are broken up, like the fountains of the great deep; where reptiles are crawling about, over gold and coral;—and seagems and skeletons are all jumbled together. It is a torrent, that comes down upon you—thundering through the mountains—stained with subterranean ore; and encumbered with the wreck and ravage of a deluged empire. His Seventy-six, however, saving some laughable blunders, in the way of authorship, is altogether superiour as a novel. But I have no leisure to criticise that, now. The first tale is told by an Indian, (a descendant of Logan,)—the second by an old revolutionary soldier, who gives fair notice, that he shall write just as he pleases. Perhaps this fact may account for their incoherency; and for an appearance, which I can only explain, by saying that—because people, in conversation, do not always finish their sentences, this writer does not; and that, many pages look, as if they had been written, without points, and without thought—and then pointed, by a blind man, as well as they could be, at hap-hazard. Good night.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Sunday morning. Nobody to trouble me, this morning, dear Stafford, so that, without recurring to our novels, which I am heartily tired of, I have some hope of being able to scribble awhile longer upon our national literature. Oh—the editor of the Galaxy. I had forgotten him, again. His name is Buckingham. He is a strong minded man; very honest, very sincere, and very obstinate.--- You are mistaken about his hostility to your countrymen. He makes battle only with such of you, as are eternally growling, like your own bull-dogs, at everything American; and with the runaway English, who come here to abuse us, and snarl at us, and pick our pockets. He is a man of no education—was, for a short time, an humble performer upon an humble provincial theatre— then, a printer—and is now, editor and printer of a paper, that, if he stick to it, as I think he will, must be a fortune to him. He is a bold writer—sometimes an eloquent one; a good reasoner—but too fond of going all lengths, when not required; but he, even he, is not a man of a genuine, natural, inward love or relish, for poetry. He might have been, (as the editor of the Charleston Courier is,) but it is too late now. He is a thousand times more than he would believe, under the influence of education. The finest thing in the world—prose or poetry—would run an equal chance of being damned, by him, up hill and down—from beginning to end;—or praised, in the same way, without any qualification or doubt—as it happened to be read, by him, before anybody else had expressed an opinion—or after another, a rival editor, had praised or censured it;—or, as the thermometer happened to be higher or lower;—or, himself interrupted, a greater or less number of times, while reading it. There is no calculation to be made upon his opinion of anything. It does'nt depend, in any degree, upon the subject itself; but upon the state of the atmosphere, for the time—the source through which the matter comes to him—the state of his paper for the week—whether full or empty—the style, in general, of his writing for the same week—whether bitter or pleasant—whether he have set his teeth into many or few; and, in short, upon anything and everything, but the true merit of the question itself. His first inquiry would be—not—How shall I treat this man, or this question, or this book, on account of its real character. But—how shall I treat it, or him, so as to excite the most astonishment? Suppose it a book:—the question is not, how shall I speak of it, on account of the work itself; or the readers of it; or the author—but, how shall I speak of it, to avail the New-England Galaxy, the Editor, and the Readers, thereof. Yet, after all, why should we scold him? All reviewers do the same thing. Our Political Writers are worthy of all praise. They are apt to be too declamatory and boastful to be sure; but, in general, their writings abound in a more rational, practical, comprehensive, and profound knowledge of what they are talking about, than those of any other politicians that I know—except Aristotle— who is, after all, the fountain of wisdom on that subject. We have many writers, too, on political economy, of great merit—plain, practical men; at the head of whom, since Alexander Hamilton's day, stand Matthew Carey, and Daniel Raymond;—the first of whom, is, undoubtedly, the most useful writer of the time; and the latter, except that he is a little too flippant—as most young men are, when contending with established authority, and rebelling against it—even to bloodshed—disdaining to qualify or dilute—in his manner of treating Adam Smith, abounds in more sensible, original, and rational views on political economy, than any writer—who has not made it the study of his whole life:—nay, that you may not think my good opinion too much qualified by that, I will add, that he has done more than any other man— fifty times more than Lauderdale—in exposing the mischief and fallacy of Adam Smith's wealth of Nations— that text book and Bible—that urim and thummim of the high priest of political economy—with the lovers of theory and hypothesis.[21] [21] There is a Mr. NILES, too; a very plain, useful, honest, credulous, vain, culgar sort of a man, who has contrived to keep up the best record that we have, for historical reference, for many years. He is an imitator of your scoundrel Cobbett—with not a thousandth part of Cobbett's talent—but with a thousand times more honesty. He affects great plainness, and circumstantiality of detail—about the quantity of meat, potatoes, and salt, eaten in his own family—as if to understand that, were to understand the whole secret of political economy, banking and home markets. He is a man of no education—blundering over the simplest things— with such an air of self-complacency, too, as I find irresistibly diverting. Thus, he always uses went for gone; and, I believe, done for did; saying “She had went before I arrived!— “He done it immediately,” &amp;c.—a fault, however, not uncommon here—(the editor of the COLUMBIAN OBSERVER, I have caught in it,) and, probably, grown out of a corruption of I had done, in this way—I had done; I'd done; I done Mr. Niles, in imiration of Cobbett, has called his paper NILES' REGISTER, instead of NILES'S—a laughable mistake for a printer, and an editor of such pretension; for, as it stands now, it implies that there are two Niles's. Of his ignorance enough, but a passing word of his credulity. During the last war, he sought out, with the most presevering obstinacy, the whole of a long story about eight bales of scalps—taken, in this country, from men, women, and children—old and young—grey headed men and unborn babies—and sent to the British ministry—with an invoice!—marked and numbered;—believed every word of it—and recorded the whole, with a must commendable indignation. Yet the whole story was altogether a hoax—acknowledged by Franklin, for his own. He set it afloat, for amusement nearly fifty years ago: and Mr. Niles lately made a record of it—for posterity! Yet, Mr. Niles, after all, has done a great deal of good in his generation.—Ed. You mention our Historians. We have half a dozen— there are Judge Marshall, and Dr. Ramsay, and Mr. Warren, and several others, who have written the history of our country; and twenty more, at least, who have pretended to write the history of the individual states—and the life of individuals. But they are feeble and tedious in general. Ramsay is the best; but he is too diffuse, too amiable, and too credulous. The same idle tale may be traced, not unfrequently, through half a dozen of them, up to some newspaper of the day; the sagacious speculations of whose editor are always preserved, as if they were something oracular. Judge Marshall is a truly great man;—and, would he abridge his life of George Washington, to one fourth of its present size; write it all himself, and reason as he does, sometimes, upon the bench, he would do much to redeem us. At present, it is said, that the best history, of our revolution, has been written by an Italian! named Botta —shame on us. There is one work, to be sure, said to be by Mr: Allen, the poet, of which—no, I cannot permit myself to believe such a story; and, I will not repeat it, except to say that it was built by the job. Do you understand the phrase?—by two poets—one Lawyer—one Reviewer —and one Editor of a newspaper. It purports to be a history of the American Revolution—by Paul Allen; but, what it is, it might be difficult to tell. Mr. Allen had little or no hand at all in it, they say. Of our Orators—We have an army of this kind of cattle. A republican government you know, is the very hot bed of eloquence. There are multitudes, in every state legislature; every court of justice; and, in every popular assembly. Nay, in every country village, you will find the greatest orator of America. You will excuse my being very particular on the subject—and content yourself with a few sketches of our most conspicuous ones. In the first place, there is an entire misconception, and misunderstanding of what constitutes eloquence in this country. It does not seem to be imagined by any one here, that eloquence is not a distinct and given quality; a substantial matter, having but one shape and colour. The only notion that prevails, so far as I can understand it, is, that eloquence consists in high sounding words, poetry, and fluency. No distinction is made between declamation, rhetorick, argument, oratory, and eloquence. And, when a young man has once chosen his profession, it never enters into his head, that eloquence must always be appropriate to that profession;—severe and argumentative, in the temple of justice; more hurried and passionate before a jury, than before the bench:—more lofty and poetical before a popular assembly:—more studied, violent, and familiar; and declamatory by starts, upon the stage; and more awful, collected, and unbending, in the courts of the living God. But, they make no such distinction. Judicial; popular; theatrical; and religious eloquence are all the same thing to them. In one word—the grand idea of eloquence is, that it is a compound of rhetorick and poetry, and gesture. Yet, I have heard Mr. Randolph called an eloquent man. Ridiculous!—he is a distempered, rambling, acrimonius fellow--exceedingly ambitious, without mind or judgment—nay, he has not the power to make any man minister to his ambition. He is fluent, witty, pungent and burning—but he is neither a statesman, a politician, nor an orator. He has an honest heart, it may be; but there is no steadiness in his view; no scope nor calculation.— He never argues, and never convinces. When his opponents are silenced, it is by his flippancy, sarcasm, and insolence. It is only of late, that his friends have discovered what his enemies have long known—that he is a man of great genius, cruelly disordered; a creature of high faculties, jumbled together, without arrangement, and slumbering or rebellious, like so many Persian satraps, just as the whim seizes them; in one word, a peevish, pestilent fellow, out of his element. In short, John Randolph cannot be eloquent—for he cannot reason—he never framed a syllogism in his life; and his speeches, if a map of his mind were laid before us; and they were traced out, with all their obliquities, and intersections, would resemble the route of a defeated army. His thoughts are continually rallying, and never united. He affects to lighten, sometimes, with that indignant spirit, which cannot, will not brook, the tedious formula of demonstration; and he never fails more completely. Why he has been treated with such deference, at any one time, it would not be difficult to tell. But, he never was respected; much less, revered; and, never had any permanent influence; for men, who wondered at his power; and dreaded his tartness, were afraid to trust themselves to him, for an hour. It was, at a time of vol. ii. U much popular excitement. He came out from among a great party, and publickly apostatized. He became a spectacle, like the Jew at Vienna, who is annually converted, at just exactly enough expense, to exhaust the funds of the society, established there, for the conversion of Jews, to Christianity. So much for John Randolph. Let us approach some other of these terrible beings. But remember;—you are to keep what I have said, constantly in view—that eloquence, here, is considered a positive given quality; and that, he who is eloquent in one place, would continue to be so, though he carried the same style into any other. Thus he, of the forum, may go to the bench, or into the pulpit, and talk the same rhapsodies; and nobody has the courage to call him to account. The fact is, that we are spoiled by the Irish fashion; and the British parliament—half of our school boys are rehearsing from counseller Phillips—and the other half, ransacking books of poetry, for quotations to lug in, by the head and shoulders, whenever it is possible—and studying the gesture, attitude, and intonations of the stage; or, at least, of other men. You have heard of Mr. Wirt. He is now the Attorney General of the United States. He affects poetry, too; but, if the cast of his countenance, and the character given of him, by those who know him; and among others, by Judge Rand, of Virginia, may be depended upon, he has mistaken his power. His attribute is strength—peculiar strength. Yet, there is a great and beautiful proportion in his mind. He is too fond of ornament—nay, he is profuse and prodigal (tautology, Stafford; but, in America, that is considered a leading beauty) of it.— Once, this was carried to a ridiculous excess. The subject was buried in “furbelows and flounces.” He is an author too; and his British Spy, the first of his productions, I believe, is deservedly ranked among the most beautiful of our country. He has written a novel, too, but I have never read it.[22] [22] But—I have. It is only a so so sort of a thing.—Ed. It is called The Old Bachelor. But, he undertook, (by contract, too, I suppose; what a pity that men will bargain away their immortality for a mess of pottage!) to get up the life of Patrick Henry, one of the truly great men of America;--a being, who, in his power and originality, stood up like a giant, among dwarfs; and dictated to them, in the plain, great language of a giant—of one, that feels himself, in every limb and blood-vessel---what they were to do. Patrick Henry was an eloquent man. Yet, you would look in vain, for ornament, and rhetorick, and poetry, in his sayings. No!—his manner was above that. It was kingly. No —It was greater!—It was republican!—His manner was as the manner of Paul, upon Mar's Hill—or of Brutus, before the men of Rome—or of Cato, in the Roman Senate—stern, and full of self possession, disdaining to talk musically, or poetically. Yet, Patrick Henry was eloquent. The men that heard him, shook in all their limbs; and the sweat fell, like rain, from their foreheads. Mr. Wirt had heard of this; but he had false notions of eloquence. He attempted to describe it—but, he described only rhetorick. He wrote a book of five hundred pages, octavo, to prove that Patrick Henry was an eloquent man; and he finished, by showing that he was a rhetorician; and that his biographer was beside himself. There was never a more intemperate, injudicious, and unworthy biography. Instead of pushing Patrick Henry forward, with his limbs all uncovered; standing unmoved, amid the convulsion and turbulence of all the political elements of the day; he, himself, mounts upon his shoulders; and covers him, all over, with flowers and festoons, and fire works. In short, The Life of Patrick Henry is a reproach to our literature; and utterly unworthy of Mr. Wirt; although it has been daubed with flattery, from one end of the country to the other; observe —it has been; but the good people have just begun to rub their eyes, and ask, where Patrick Henry is, all this time? They look about them, but can see nothing, but Mr. Wirt. The eloquence of Mr. Wirt, is the best and truest, at times, that our country affords. I have heard him, pursue, like a metaphysician, for a whole hour together, a point of law, before the court, with a certainty and precision; and in a style, so transcendently beyond the technical trash of the mere lawyer, although there was nothing inflated in it, that I have listened to him, with amazement, and delight; nay, till I have forgotten—and would, that I could forget, forever! that he was the author of Patrick Henry's life. He is a man, six feet, two inches high, I should suppose; with a very large, heavy, but not ungraceful person; and a countenance, of great strength and amplitude, rather than beauty or precision;--but nothing, absolutely nothing, except a little pleasantry of the eye, that indicates either sensibility or genius. Yet, he has both, to a degree sufficient for any great man. His manner is gentlemanly, and commanding; and I have seen him, when it was remarkable for dignity and ease. As a speaker, his bearing is full of stout, indolent self possession; and a sort of heavy, lounging gracefulness. It is not easy to express my meaning, in a few words, without an appearance of conceit—what I would have you imply, however, is this: that, in his corporeal movement, there is a gentleness, which is not the gentleness of imbecility—nor is it the confidential, magnanimous lolling of a giant; but rather that of a large and lazy man. Observe—I do not apply this remark to the intellectual character of Mr. Wirt. I speak, only, of his physical operations. Yet, in those of the mind, he wants energy. He is never daring, nor abrupt. There are no eruptions of genius; no annunciations of the thunderer in his eloquence; there is too much poetry; too much proportion and harmony, in all his doings, for one of such an athletick nature. He ought to dictate; he should disdain to soothe. For my part, I hate wheedling, in men, six feet two inches high; and I cannot endure their tenderness and sentiment. I can think of nothing but sick elephants. Yet, I have caught Mr. Wirt at sentiment, pathos, and tenderness—altogether beautiful, it cannot be denied; yet altogether out of place. These things are well enough for rhetoricians and poets; but, not for lawyers and men. It would amuse you, not a little, to hear our sober minded, thinking people, whose imagery and allusion, are never begotten by them, but in sweat and anxiety; wondering aloud at the innumerable apparitions, that came up at the bidding of Mr. Wirt, like the battalions of Prospero, from vacancy. To them, the operations of genius and poetry are inconceivable; the fountain gushing, suddenly, with light and inspiration; the spontaneous lustre of eloquence; the hasty and terrifick combinations—the exploding wrath, and beautiful splendours of the heated imagination, are utterly incomprehensible to them; and Genius, herself, but a pains-taking work-woman; and, even when they are hurried away, by the rapidity and noise of her evolutions; blinded and prostrate with her approach, as she goes over her dominions, upon the wind; they have that within them, which will not permit them to understand her mystery and power. To them, all is labour and toil. The flocking illustrations, that rush out— thought paired with thought—like uncaged birds—from the heart of an eloquent man, when he tears away the veil; and you are permitted to look into it; are nothing to their view, but laborious drudgery, happily brought to bear, by long practice, and after many failures. You will see them poring, amid the refuse and broken imagery, of a natural orator, after he has done speaking; as if there were some especial signification in every chip and fissure:—yea, the very painted dross that is found at the bottom of the exhausted cruicble, with all its brilliant and beautiful disorder; and fantastick shaping, will furnish them with everlasting matter of meditation and astonishment; not, as concerning the opulence —nor the wasteful prodigality of Genius—but in the amazing wisdom, and foresight, and preparation that he has evinced---even while the furnace of his heart was all in commotion. Fools!---as if the lightning could travel slowly!---as if the torrent of illustration could be stayed!---the tide rolled back!---or the fire quenched, by any incantation, less powerful than that of Him, who put them into brightness and motion! As if it were not easier for a giant to astonish you, by a continual exhibition of his power, than to withhold it; or to slumber forever, under continual provocation. Such people will gather up the rough gold, that has been rejected by the man of natural genius; or thrown out, in the agitation of his heart, without shape or purpose, in the careless profusion of his thought; and study it, as they would a series of premeditated coins and medals—as vol. ii. U2 if every flaw and stain had the stamp and finish of immortality;—yea, gaze upon the evolutions of a poetical creature in her own element—of sunshine and blue air—as if they were all the studied and predetermined attitudes of a patient, laborious, and contemplative mind —as if—heaven help the blockheads!—as if it were possible to restrain the outpouring illustration of such a nature, when all the fountains of the heart are broken up. Such men will stand, while the luminous mind of a great being is in play, like the machinery of heaven, rolling over oceans, and among stars; and wonder, not so much at the brightness, and noise, and velocity thereof, as at the little expenditure of animal strength, that is visible. To them, the mightiest operations of the human intellect, are but experiments in manufacture or machinery—mechanical improvements—like a saving of fuel in a steam-boat; or an improvement in any every-day matter of household industry. Their only wonder is, how it can be done so cheaply, and so profitably. But let me return to Mr. Wirt again. His language is remarkably well chosen and beautiful; and his ornaments, though rather profuse at times, are so free and happy, that they appear to spring up, like fountains of pure water, and flowers, to refresh some conquering magician in his march:—but, I would have him less beautiful, and more august. Let him come, full of his subject, determined to prevail; and leave the toilet of the rhetorician, to boys. For my part, I care but little, of what materials; or in what fashion the harness of Goliah be made, so that I can see the shape of the giant beneath it:—and so that it permit him to walk about, unincumbered:—and yet, I would rather see it of leather than of gold:---and studded with iron, rather than diamonds. Conquering or conquered, he should always be Goliah. I speak plainly—warmly—I feel so. Mr. Wirt is too fond of ornament, and poetry:—it suits not the style of judicial eloquence. He should disdain it. A lawyer should be characterised, by a severe simplicity—a stern, downright, and manful exhibition of power, rather than beauty. It is enervating to see great men occupied with little things. Before a jury, an occasional flourish might be well enough; but, even before a jury, it is better to reason:—and, if a man would convince or persuade, he will find that the less poetry he uses, the better it will be for his client. People may be amused—astonished—but they are never wrought upon, or convinced by metaphor. There is a ridiculous emphasis given to the tropes and figures of some men;—as if they were substantial and difficult things. The barren of heart— and poor of thought, treasure them up; and wonder at them, till they often acquire a mistaken value, that puts the good people, who talk about it, beside themselves. The difficulty with a truly poetical mind, is to withhold its illustration. It is easier, with such natures, for they are always prodigal, to overwhelm, than to husband. Yet, they, who are unfruitful—wonder at the profusion and munificence of Genius; while he is wondering at his own parsimony. Men of the former character are, as a million to one, of the latter;—and the consequence is, that the refuse of the imagination; the lavish expenditure of them that cannot be spendthrifts; and cannot be exhausted; is treasured, and stamped, and hoarded, as something inestimable—written all over with immortality and dominion—while, in reality, it is worthless in general, and often counterfeit. Sit down and repeat, to an eloquent man, some of the beautiful thought, that he has uttered before you, in the inebriety of his spirit; and he will laugh in your face.— He sees nothing remarkable in it. In his common conversation, he will say finer things. You may remember; but he has forgotten them. They cost him no toil. To him, it is a matter of surprise that men can ever think so abstractedly, as that one idea alone, unaccompanied by its associates and resemblances, shall be present to them. There!—I have now done with Mr. Wirt. Read over what I have said, and see if you have any definite notion of what he is, apart from that which you have obtained from a few plain words. I have sought to be very poetical—and what is the consequence? You are bewildered in the profusion of imagery. Could I give a better illustration of that distempered rhetorick, which is the fashion of the day?—the disordered and brilliant dreaming of men, drunk with adulation, like Charles Phillips—or yielding, like Mr. Wirt, to a fashion that they despise? But you have inquired particularly about Mr. Pinkney. And no wonder; for we are not at all backward in our pretensions to national eloquence, on his account alone. Yet Mr. Pinkney is not an eloquent man. He is convincing, to be sure; and that is to be eloquent in one way; but he would be more—and fails. What he may have been at an earlier day, I know not, of my own knowledge; but, if any faith may be placed in tradition, there has been a time, when your blood would quake to hear him. That time is past. Nay—so well do I know the natural disposition of mankind to exaggerate whatever is rare;—whatever they have seen, or heard, of the wonderful, when there is nobody to contradict them; that I am strongly inclined to believe that he is now more eloquent than ever. Till I had heard him—patiently—watchfully—reverentially, again and again, I could not dispossess myself of the awful belief that I was listening to the most eloquent man of America—if not of all this world. I had heard it said so often; and by men, so well fitted to judge, that I could not doubt the fact—until I was obliged to break away from the infatuation that enthralled me, and judge for myself. Follow me, and you shall know the result. Nothing can be further from eloquence; if, by eloquence, be understood, any thing that is persuasive, beautiful, dignified or natural, than the declamation or reasoning of William Pinkney. There is no captivation or beauty of manner, tone, or gesture about him. His best speeches are a compound of stupendous strength; feeble ornament; affected earnestness, and boisterous, turbulent declamation. His deportment is brutal, arrogant, “full of sound and fury;”—but the fury of no man ever signified so much, I do believe;—unnatural and vehement; accompanied with the rude and violent gesture of a vulgar fellow, of uncommon personal strength, in a violent passion; and transitions of voice, so sudden, and uncalled for; as to jar your whole system: and action, that you cannot imagine the purpose of, except it be to prove that he has the use of his arms, It is never illustrative—never correspondent to the thought,---never dignified—and never gentlemanly.— Yet—yet—my friend—Mr. Pinkney is a great man— a truly great man.—His mind is adamant, clamped with iron---a colossal pile of granite, over which the thunders of heaven might roll; upon which, the lightnings might exhaust themselves, without shaking, or harming it. And were he contented with such a reputation, as no man that knows the structure of his intellect, would deny to him, he would have no rival. He knows that he is, decidedly, the greatest lawyer of America;--- but this would not content his ambition. He would monopolise the immortality of a kingdom. He would be not only the greatest lawyer, but the greatest orator —and the greatest statesman.—A statesman, he might have been; and, probably, one of the profoundest that ever lived:—a lawyer he is; and one, whose might is unquestioned. But—God never meant him for an orator.— He has no property of mind or body—no, not one— calculated to give him dominion in eloquence; and were it not for the prodigious elevation, solidity, and amplitude of his mind, which makes the great overlook his pretension as a speaker; and the mob to echo their judgment without understanding the reason of it—he would not be tolerated for an hour. No— God never meant William Pinkney for an orator: but he meant him for something more; and, but for a strange perversity common to all men, which sets them toiling hardest, for that reputation, which they are supposed least likely to obtain—dissatisfied with whatever-measure of fame their fellows may award to them, unconditionally as their natural and indisputable right, —and makes them anxious to live, by a tribute wrenched from the reluctant understanding of men,— but for this, William Pinkney would have been, at this hour, one of the greatest men of the age. But, it is too late now.—He is going down, with a continually accelerated motion, to the chambers of death.—I do not perceive any decay of his faculties—but it is not, in the nature of things, that he should continue many years long er, unsubdued by the inroads of age; or unaffected by the labour of his profession. His industry, even yet, after the study of nearly half a century, is unparalleled. No young man toils, with a more vehement anxiety, at his first case, than William Pinkney,[23] [23] It is not true that Mr. P. studied, or read, diligently while at London. I know that he did not. Ed. even yet, at every matter of moment in which he is engaged. From what he is now, as a lawyer, you may form some notion of what he might have been, had he rightly understood his own powers, at first; foreborne to dissipate his strength in experiment;—turned his back, in scorn, upon the reputation of an orator;—disdaining to become a politician; and directed all the stupendous energies of his nature to the study of jurisprudence. Who then would have mated him? Who then would have dared to walk, where the shadow of Pinkney might have fallen upon him! He opened his career by studying medicine;—and, soon after, began to read law with the celebrated Judge Chase, whose attention he afterward awakened, in a debating society, where he appeared as the champion of Mary, queen of Scots. From that hour, his destiny seemed fixed. He desired to be eloquent. He thought of Demosthenes and Cicero; and his heart swelled with ambition. He remembered not, that he was to be a lawyer;—and that Demosthenes and Cicero—were declaimers. He forgot that he was to argue—and that they had only harangued. It never occurred to him that twelve men, are not to be agitated like a multitude: nor, that it is easier, to put an ocean of human hearts into an uproar, than the heart of one single, sober-minded man. He reflected not, that the world had grown wiser too, since the days of the Greek and Roman; and that he, who should look to move a body of Americans, in a court of justice, now, with the best thundering of Demosthenes, would only make himself ridiculous. But he erred yet more widely.—He worried his mind with politicks, when his course was not to be a political one; and he knew it, or ought to have known it. He had chosen the temple of justice; and become one of its priesthood; and yet he had the presumption to dream of awing and agitating her ministers, while sitting in judgment, with the incantations of eloquence.— The thought was absurd; but it grew out of a mighty ambition. It had been as wise in the Gaul, when he stood before the old men of Rome, in their Senate Chamber, to think of terrifying them by the clash of his armour. Let me give you some notion of his appearance, first; and then, I will return to the character of his mind.— Imagine a thick, stout man, with a red, fat, English face remarkable for nothing at all—apparently about forty five years of age; thin, dark, hair cut close—about five feet ten inches high---very fashionably dressed---with a continual appearance of natural superciliousness, and affected courtesy;---a combination of the English Bully —and the English Dandy.[24] [24] Since this was written, the giant has gone down, like a giant, to the household of death. There let the fire of his great heart; the dust of his mighty brain, sleep undisturbed. I have looked over all that I have said; but I cannot alter it. Much as I tremble to stir the ashes of such men—unwilling as I am to put out my hand upon the pall that shrouds him, and all his anointed faults,—yet I must do it. What I have written of him, was written in truth and soberness, while he was lording it over all his cotemporaries; and were I to blot out that, no honest testimony would remain upon record, for men to appeal to, when I am where he is, abiding their judgment, in silence. His friends, and them that love him, would make him something more than a great man; his enemies something less. I who have been neither his friend nor his enemy, have told the truth. No other man has. I never heard the truth spoken of him—I never saw the truth written of him. Mr. Walsh—in his modesty, had the kindness, to manufacture an inscription, under circumstances, which the Baltimore bar will not soon forget,—wherein he seems to have exhausted his own dictionary, in words of unmeaning, inappropriate and indiseriminate praise. Paul Allen too, must take up his character—and what did he?—missed almost every distinguishing feature of William Pinkney's character, and produced a beautiful poem—instead of a biographical sketch. Twenty others have done the same thing;—but instead of copying from life—they have copied from each other; and the publick, in their wisdom, because all these pictures resenible each other, take it for granted, that they must resemble him. Yes—I have told the truth—but I would blot it out—I would, at this moment, in tenderness and compassion to them that tremble, when his name is mentioned irreverently, were it not, in my opinion the duty of every man that loves the rising spirit of our country, to caution our young speakers against the eloquence of William Pinkney; at the same time that he lifts up his voice, with that of the wise and deliberate, in praise of his greatness as a lowyer!— his learning—his industry—his untiring ambition:—and calls upon them to remember that, and prostrate themselves before him—but, to beware of his style of elocution. You see what he might have been—had not his energies been dissipated and distracted, by the variety of aims. Yet, walk where he would, he pursued his way, like a conqueror;—and had well nigh established himself as the high priest of eloquence in America. It is time that we tear down the urim and thummim from his breast. He is a stupendous reasoner; but, what you would not readily believe of one, so characterised by solidity and strength, he is passionately fond of ornament and deviation. He is a great general:—but, in the middle of a campaign you may entice him from his entrenchments by a rocket. Bring him in contact with a truly poetical mind, under much excitement, and his argument resembles a battery of coloured fire works—giving out incessant brightness and reverberation. And yet, Mr. Pinkney has only a good taste—a good memory—and a large collection of such ready made pictures. They are not manufactured in the heat and hurry of the blood:—the light that they give out, is not that of spontaneous combustion:—but rather that which is formally prepared— kindled by attrition—when the material is heated to transparency in a slow heat. He has not the faculty of coining and impressing beautiful imagery, off hand:— and his profusion is that of one, who, in his extremest prodigality, keeps an eye at the bottom of his purse. I have heard him often enough, to anticipate whole classes of illustration—and ornament; for, they are, often, so strangely linked together; probably by their arrangement in the toy-shop of his memory—that one who has been long familiar with him and his doings, will tremble at the first glitter, as if he had laid a forbidden hand upon some key-bayonet of the Tower; and were about to bring down the whole armoury about his ears. I have heard Mr. Pinkney begin, by dividing his subject into three parts; and the first division exhausted it. This, he was fully sensibly of; but he is a great lover of arrangement; and he persisted in giving us the three parts, nevertheless—in the way of “recapitulation, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.” Mr. Pinkney has the power, if he had the manhood and self denial, to use it; to make every stepping stone of his argument, a luminious spot—and to storm the works of his enemy, whenever he would. But he is eternally diverted from his object. He is thinking of himself—of the mob. He cannot forget that he is William Pinkney—“Minister Plenipotentiary;” and that all eyes are upon him; and he will turn aside, at any time, to answer a paltry witticism; or to quote Gil Blas or Shakspeare;—or scuffle with some poetical apparition of his adversary;—or to tell about the Orders in Council, “in the negociation of which matter, he had the honour, if the court please, of being an humble instrument”—or, what is worse yet, to compliment the court with the most downright and lubberly adulation:—or—or— to sneer at some younger man, who may not have the spirit to retort—to the giant's heart—upon the spot. Aye —and say what you will of Mr. Pinkney's argument, I never saw him yet; no, never—pursue his argument, steadily, for ten minutes at a time. He is always dashing abroad—foraging among antiquated doctrines—or foisting in a kind of learning, which serves no earthly purpose but to show how well he remembers, what he has often said before; and what has nothing to do, and never can be made to have anything to do, with the case. These interludes and episodes are forgiven in him, in compassion to his greatness;—and because of his earnestness and vehemence; but they ought to be put a stop to. It is a reproach to any court of justice, to permit any man; even William Pinkney, to rehearse his old arguments, in forgotten cases, for the astonishment of a rabble; and, were I a judge, I would as soon permit him to ransack the literature of China—or explode, in a panegyrick upon steam boats, as to ramble in the way he will sometimes do, when he has a large auditory. Let me tell you one or two anecdotes of him. He is fond of quotations—and scatters latin about, with particular emphasis. These are, in general, pretty well dove-tailed into the body of the subject; but they sometimes puzzle me confoundly to discover their application—or place—till he has made both, for them. One day, he was quite in a tempest,—to what amount, I would not undertake to say—but the fee must have been pretty respectable. While in heat, he used the words outer darkness—simple and common words enough, one would think, without any authority;—but Mr. Pinkney lets no opportunity escape, of manifesting his turbulent familiarity with the classicks. He drew a long breath—and added, with deep emphasis, “as Shakspeare says!” Who would not have smiled! Mr. Pinkney had probably encountered the phrase somewhere;—but where, it was not so easy to tell. In such a case, no better name could possibly occur, for a doubtful progeny, than vol. ii. W that of Shakspeare. True—it was rather unlucky;— for there were some persons, in all probability, that heard him, who had read the Bible, and remembered the phrase;—and more than one, who knew that, whatever else might be in Shakspeare, the words outer darkness were not But Mr. Pinkney was either ashamed to quote the Bible—or ignorant of the authority. He wants magnanimity. He is not the friend of the powerful and ambitious, if they approximate at all, to the limits of his dominion; and I have known him to play off a paltry stratagem, to delude his associate counsel; lead him deliberately astray; assist him in thickening his errour; and then, as he rose, turn deadly pale with the sense of his own unworthiness. But let me leave this anecdote. It was one of treachery and legerdemain, utterly beneath the manhood of William Pinkney's nature—and one, for which he ought to have been shot. The physical powers of Mr. Pinkney are, to my notion, strictly correspondent with his intellectual ones. Both are solid, strong, and substantial; but without grace, dignity, or loftiness; and both have a dash of fat English dandyism. He affects to be courtly and conciliatory, at times—but nothing can be more ridiculous. All the training in the world would not make a gentleman of him. He neither looks, acts, speaks, sits, nor talks, like one. He dresses too fashionably; and too much, as if it were a serious matter with him. Some years ago, he was a notorious sloven; and I have seen him, when the extreme gentility of his coat, would not permit him to carry a pocket handkerchief—on a hot day—all in a sweat—and actually foaming at the mouth; —yes, I, myself, have seen him, at such a time, wiping his nose and lips on the sleeve of his coat;—and the next moment, it may be, while declaiming as if he would rupture all his arteries, stand and pick his nose, with his finger, in the judge's face. I have heard these things contradicted—but I have seen them; and I hold myself answerable for what I say. His manner, as I have already told you, is exceedingly arrogant and unpropitiating; his style of eloquence, a most disagreeable and unnatural compound, of the worst faults of the worst speakers. Mighty men, they that are his models, may have been, in the way of reasoning; but they were shamefully deficient in dignity, grace and bearing. He is said to resemble Lord Erskine, as he was, in the day of his power. It is a libel on Erskine, who was himself a libel on the reputation of his country, as a speaker. He is more after the fashion of your noisy, parliamentary haranguers, who make it a point to work themselves into an artificial heat, the moment that they get possession of the floor, whatever may be the subject. The language of Mr. Pinkney does resemble that of Lord Erskine. His reasoning is about as forcible—but he abounds more, in what the lawyers call departure. You may be able to form some estimate of his character from the following anecdote. You have heard of Mr. Dexter—a yankee. He was once opposed to Mr. Pinkney in the supreme court of the United States, where each played for life and death. Mr. Dexter was a plain man; very simple and direct in his operations; but once in the wake of his enemy, there was no turning him aside. He never troubled himself with manœuvring or flourishing;—his only object was to get alongside; when he boarded at once, without smoke, or noise. The galleries were crowded. The debate continued for several days;—and Mr. Dexter prevailed. Yet, Mr. Pinkney was pronounced the greatest orator in the world! A friend of mine was there, a few days after; and was induced to ask some young man, whom he met in company; and who was really eloquent on the subject, what was the argument of Mr. Pinkney. My friend was a plain spoken, sensible man; who, when he went to call a man a fool, always enunciated the word, as if he meant to spell it for him, thus—f-o-o-l. He would permit nobody to mistake him. “His argument!” said the young man, whom we will call Mr. A. if you please,—“O, it was a—a—but his eloquence, sir!—by heaven, sir!—he thundered and lightned, sir, before us!—he shook the house to its foundations, sir!—every heart stood still!—he—he—” “But the argument?” said my friend, quietly. “O, the argument!—yes, sir, to be sure—the argument, sir!—it was so clear and—ah! here is one of his figures, sir!—“These plants,” said he, sir, “have been watered with blood, sir”—and—and—and, sir—“the thunder and smoke of the atlantic—” “But the argument?” repeated my friend. “Why, sir—I really—I—don't know how it is. It was beautiful, I remember; and perfectly convincing— perfectly—yes, sir, perfectly.” “Perfectly?” “Yes, perfectly,” repeated the young man, resolutely; rubbing his hands. “I dare say so. We oftentimes remember that we have been satisfied with the result, without being able to recal the process.” “Precisely, sir—precisely. That is my case.” “Well, perhaps you can tell me something of the eloquence of Mr. Dexter. You are a great admirer of eloquence, I perceive, sir.” “The eloquence of Mr. Dexter—ha! ha! ha!—excuse me, sir; excuse me—the eloquence of---ha! ha! ha!---why, really, sir, I—but I can tell you what his argument was—Mr. Dexter's eloquence---ha! ha! ha!” “Ah! well, I shall be obliged to you.” Well! I don't know anything about the law, sir; but I a m sure that these are his very words, his very words---I shall never forget them—eloquence!---eloquence of Mr. Dexter!---upon my word, sir, I cannot help laughing.” “Well, then, the argument?” “O, it was after this manner,” said Mr. A.---and then he took up the whole, and went through it; and repeated, step by step, the whole of Mr. Dexter's argument. It was a chain that could not be broken. Every link was perfect. My friend was silent for some minutes. “And who got the case,” said he, at last. “Sir!---O, Mr. Dexter, to be sure. He was on the right side. That was it! Lord, it was all as plain as A. B. C. Yes, sir, yes!---Mr. Pinkney was on the wrong side.---Every body knows that. Ah! if Mr. Pinkney had been on that side—zounds! what a speech he'd have made of it.” There, Stafford!---that anecdote will show something of the state of publick opinion here. A man that was capable of writing, upon the very brain of a thoughtless, and ignorant youngster, as in letters of fire, the whole of a long argument; so that he was able to repeat it, without knowing why; and a man; a lawyer; who was capable of making one of the most difficult and perplexing questions of our law, appear as plain as the alphabet, to a boy; and to prevail against a host of lawyers; precedent, authority, usage, and opinion---and much prejudice---that man was not known to be eloquent. There are several others, of whom I would speak, but I am heartily weary of the subject. Yet I ought not to forget Mr. Webster---Daniel Webster; one of the most accomplished scholars among us---a great lawyer---and one of the strong men of the earth. He will have few rivals, or none, at the end of ten years. He is a savage looking fellow, with hollow black eyes; and a stern well built forehead. He is, undoubtedly, a good man; but I should not sleep very quietly in the same room with such a face, in Italy or Spain. He has the look of a murderer. There is Emmet, an old man, with a fresh, pleasant face; Lowndes, and Calhoun, and Sargeant, and---no matter whom. Not long since, Webster set the whole bench of our supreme court in tears, upon a dry matter of law---the Dartmouth college question:---how, they knew not;---for they sat upright, the bright drops trickling down their venerable faces, without suspecting it, till they saw, in each other's eyes, what astonished them—tears! Mr. Clay is an awkward looking man, with a kind of homespun foppery about him---wide ruffles, and smoothly combed hair---a feeble face, and a mouth, remarkable for its expression of imbecility; yet a man of unquestionable talent---light hair---five feet ten--- talks well. Judge Marshall---six feet---dark and hard ---very feeble voice, and great mind. Mr. Sargeant, a little, dark looking, phlegmatick fellow---face all alive with solidity, self-possession and keenness. vol. ii. W 2 Come to this country, dear Stafford; and the first thing that I will do, will be to lead you into the supreme court of the United States. But you will be indignant, unless I first explain the mystery of the trade. America has produced several men, that would do honour to Westminster Hall---but they all talk too much, and so do your great men. William Pitt was the only exception. Maryland has been very fruitful in great men---Samuel Chase, Dulany, Luther Martin, Pinkney, Harper, &amp;c.[25] [25] Eloquence!—The Maryland Bar is emphatically, the School of Eloquence. Let me give you two or three examples. “Behold him!—see him!—look at him, gentlemen of the jury,” said one of them, in a moment of inspiration—“there he stands!—walking about—with the cloak of hypocrisy in his mouth—trying to wire draw—three oak trees—out of my client's pocket.” “Sir,” said another, “a man who could do that, sir, must have a heart, sir—a heart, sir— gem'men o' the jury—as black, sir—as black—sir—”—(a bye-stander saw his distress, and thrust out his hat toward him)—“as black as your hat, gem'men o' the jury.” “She was youthful,” said a third, “as love—beautiful as an angel, sir”—(it was on a petition for divorce, on the floor of the assembly)—“and as virtuous, sir—as virtuous, sir— as—as—as could be expected.”—Ed. The mystery is this. Every lawyer knows that his client will be better satisfied, if his lawyer talked a good while, with great heat and earnestness, and lost the case; than if he got up, like a Mansfield; and, after stating the matter in half a dozen words, won the case. If the first happen, he consoles himself with saying—“Well, well, it was money well laid out. He earned it. He made the case his own. It was'nt his fault, that I lost it. It was that of the jury, or the judge, or the witnesses, or any thing but the advocate.” But, in the latter case, he is discontented. “What!” says he, “only half a dozen words for my money. Why need I employ him? Anybody could have done as much. The case was perfectly simple. The jury only wanted to hear it stated, to give a verdict. So much money wasted!” You may smile, Stafford, but it is a piteous truth; and where is the wonder, then, if lawyers, whose profession it is, to talk at established prices, should mete out their eloquence, in proportion to their fee, rather than their subject. Men will have their money's worth—that is, just as much talk as their neighbours, for the same money, whatever be the subject. It is just so, throughout all the world. We do not mind being cheated, if our neighbours are cheated too. Go to a shopkeeper. Demand his price. He names it— but abates, and abates, till you get it for half the first price. Yet you go away dissatisfied—you do not know but another may get it cheaper; and you repent that you did not try it again; and if another should get it cheaper, you are dissatisfied with your bargain. But you go to another. He asks you a certain price. He won't vary a penny. You buy it; and find that you have been cheated. But then, you say, all the world that buy it, are cheated too. Nobody can do better than I. Nay, if you buy to sell again, it is better to give high prices; if others be made to give them too; for you invest your funds more easily, and save transportation. O, the shop!— Farewell! I shall resume the matter again, soon. ED. MOLTON.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SPENCER RANDOLPH TO SARAH RAMSAY. Philadelphia —. Gracious heaven, Sarah! are you mad?—what can possess you? Is it possible that it was you.—Would you rush upon your own destruction! Whence are you? why are you here?—would you provoke me to destroy you, in spite of all my better feeling? Tell me your purpose. The messenger will wait your answer. His orders are imperative. He will never leave your door, till he have seen you—never! RANDOLPH.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ANSWER. Yes, Randolph, it was, Sarah Ramsay, that you saw —the abused and wronged, whose spectre will haunt you, for your unkindness, forever and ever. What! is it not enough, Randolph, that I am reduced almost to the grave by an unquiet spirit—a spirit, that would have slept, and did sleep, when we parted; but thou must rush in upon it, again, and awaken it by a menace. Yet, I do not fear thee, I do not. Thou wouldst not harm me, Randolph, I am sure, do what I would to thee. I have seen that in thine eyes; that, it may be, which no other ever saw in them; the dear gentleness of a spirit, that would be kind, but would not have it known. No, Randolph I have not pursued thee. I will not. I am come here, not to see thee—though that hope was sweet to me, I confess---but it was a secret and buried one---no: I came to weep with Juliet---and to preserve her. I would be that sentinel over her, that I could not be over myself. I will protect her from a man---a devil. Be not alarmed. I shall not go abroad; and, painful as it would be, I will depart immediately; and return, if my presence be hateful to thee. Nay—that is too strong a word. I ought not to have written it; forgive me, Randolph—and let me know where I shall direct a note, if you determine that I may remain here, so that it may meet you, in case of necessity. What shall I do? I wait your bidding. Be as peremptory as you will. Randolph, my friend—I will obey. South Fifth street. SARAH.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">RANDOLPH TO SARAH. Yes—stay where thou art. Comfort thy friend—cheer and support her. Gather what consolation thou canst from her; and watch over and sustain her. She is in peril. Direct to No.—Arch-street; if any thing should happen.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">JOHN TO SARAH. Norfolk, —. I hear that you are in Philadelphia; and I never was so glad of anything in my life. Frank has just written that Grenville has ordered me to meet him, with Juliet, at Charleston—me, you observe, not Molton. What does this portend?—more discretion I hope. He will undoubtedly be there first;—and, I dare say that Juliet's health will be improved by it. Cannot you go with us? I am sure that you can, dear Sarah—how is it? You have nothing to prevent you,—unless that drawing master, of whom you used to speak—or the deaf-and-dumb man be tagging after you. I shall set off tomorrow; and hope to be with you by Wednesday night; and then! then Sarah, we shall all be happy again. Grenville was altogether better I hear. JOHN OMAR.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SARAH TO RANDOLPH. Meet me at three o'clock, by the Schuylkill Bridge. I have much to tell you. Juliet has received a letter from Grenville; and she has sent for Molton, who is to come this afternoon. I am sorry to see such confidence between them; and have half a mind to remain and watch them. What think you----would he dare to meet me? But, you do not know him? He is a consummate villain. Hitherto, I have been unable to write his name, such has been my scorn of him. Juliet is determined to join her husband, at Charleston, notwithstanding her health; and spend the winter there. He is nearly well, she says---but why do I trouble thee, with this Randolph; thou canst not understand the delirious joy that agitates a woman, a wife, when the lord of her heart, is resuscitated, all at once, from the grave. I shall have to return. I cannot go with her. Why! dear Randolph---Let me not conceal the truth---though it cover my forehead, as it does, at this moment, with shame, to confess it. It is because I cannot bear to be so far away from you. Is not this wrong?----It is. Yet I cannot retract. I must on---on---on!---although I shudder, when I look back, a few months; and ask myself, what could have persuaded me then, to a clandestine meeting with a man. O Randolph, Randolph!---thou hast brought me to this. Monday, 9. A. M. S.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ANSWER. I will meet you, dear woman----but not there. That were madness. Let us arrange a better place. Cannot I see you, at your house? What is to prevent you?---or, if you will take a walk up Chesnut street, at four, I will join you. My advice is, that you should not see that Mr. Molton. Nay--I should say it somewhat earnestly, were I not fearful of appearing jealous. Therefore, do as you please about it. But, if he be a bad man, with your present feeling toward him, it will give him some power over you; and if he be not, how will you ever pardon yourself, for the outrage.—At four—remember. Monday, 10, A. M. RANDOLPH.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SARAH TO RANDOLPH. No—not this afternoon—not, there: not till tomorrow —I know one or two families, in that street; and the risk would be too great;—but we must meet, we must, before this matter is entirely arranged—I shall notify you in the morning. I have a strange desire to see him, nevertheless. Monday, 10½, A. M. S. R.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SAME TO SAME. Morning — Yes, it is determined upon. Juliet sets off the day after tomorrow; and as there is a charming opportunity for me to return, in a private carriage here, I shall go tomorrow. I will pass you by the post office, at three. But we must not be long together; and our manner must be that of acquaintances only. You understand me. I want to tell you about this Molton. I have seen him. I could'nt resist the impulse; and, before he rang, I placed myself in the middle of the front parlour, with the windows darkened, and the door ajar—so that I could see him, when he entered the hall. His step was firm, and haughty I thought,—but he wore a large blue cloak; and I could not get a good view of his face or person. He was with Juliet for about half an hour; and, when I entered, I found her in tears, I told her that I had seen him. I am sorry for it, said she, for he knows your opinion of him; and his countenance looked troubled, while he was here. Nay—he confessed that he expected you to enter the room. It was well that you did not, I believe; for, I thought that I heard you step—and never shall I forget his countenance. It was terrible. You passed near the door. You paused. He threw off his cloak—and turned deliberately toward it, like one that was preparing for some fearful act of retribution. You have wronged him, Sarah; but I would not put myself in his way, if I were you. Yes, Randolph—I have made up my mind. I shall depart tomorrow; and, if it be possible, I will see Molton, face to face, before I depart. I have an unaccountable, burning anxiety to see a man, who is capable of desolating such a heart as Juliet's: but then, there is little hope of it. He will not probably come again, without being sent for; and I dare not ask Juliet to send for him. SARAH.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ED: MOLTON TO STAFFORD—IN CONTINUATION. You ask me, if it be possible for a lawyer to be honest. I answer yes—I think it is possible. “All things are possible—with God.” But, let me treat the matter seriously. The law is a noble profession—one of the noblest, to which a great man can consecrate his faculties; particularly, in America; where it is the only direct road to dominion. Let us examine it fairly, for a moment; and if it be really what your question implies, let us give it up, with all its professors, to the reprobation of all good and wise men. I think that you are wrong, Stafford; and I believe that I can set you right. You have fallen into the common errour; that of thinking a lawyer will sell his conscience to the highest bidder. He may,—I admit it:— be may, and does, now and then; and, when he does, he is a scoundrel; and would be a scoundrel, in any other situation. But, this cannot often happen. Take a case. A man of notoriously bad character, goes to his counsel. Can he refuse to listen to him? No.—His oath binds him to administer justice to all; without favour, or partiality. Having a prejudice against the man, is no reason why he should not protect him, if he be wronged. The wicked have their rights, as well as the good. And how can he tell?—what right has he to pre-judge his client?—how dare he, indeed, when he has sworn to prevent other men from pre-judging, even the most atrocious criminal—until he have heard his story? Well.... the story once told—what is he to do? He is bound, by his oath, to be faithful to his client. Though he be the greatest villain on earth he cannot betray him. Nay, he cannot be made to reveal aught, that his client has told him, however it may affect society;—yet, more:—if he should dare to offer himself before a court of justice, in testimony against his client, that court would silence him, upon the spot. What shall he do then? Shall he take up against him, after having heard his tale? No—that were impossible. And how can he know that his client is a scoundrel, or a criminal? The best story will be told him.... he will be deceived, with all his caution....and he cannot, it is not possible, that he should, know the real truth of the case, till he have come to trial:—till the jury are sworn, and the witnesses are all examined. What can he do then? He could not abandon the case, till that moment: but can he abandon it then? Can an honest man, a lawyer, who knows in his conscience, that the jury, or the court are to decide upon the case....can he presume to decide upon it?....Yet, he would do it, if he were to withdraw at such a moment. This is a case that can happen very rarely—but I will suppose, if you please, that the lawyer does become convinced, in his heart, that his client is a scoundrel, or a criminal;—nay, I will even suppose that he knew it, from the first moment. I care not by what means—such a thing is barely possible, and could only happen, from the evidence of the lawyer's own senses of the fact—but I am willing to suppose that case, as the strongest that can possibly happen, against my doctrine. Suppose, then, that the lawyer knew, from the moment that his client applied to him, that he was wrong; nay, that he was the most guilty and terrible of ruffians. Would he be justified in refusing to defend him? Reflect, for a moment. I do not ask if he would be justified in attempting to cheat, and hurry the jury into an acquittal of his client, where the evidence was conclusive against him? Still less, do I ask, if he would be justified in lying to them—in calling heaven to witness, that the man was innocent; and that he believed him to be so—no!—for such things are an outrage upon the sanctity of man's nature, and upon his origin. It is madness, and blasphemy. And he who could say it, would deserve to suffer on the spot, the punishment of Ananias. But, I ask if he may not be justified, in undertaking his defence?—Has the greatest criminal no rights to guard? He may have forfeited his life; but, is every man's hand, therefore, to be raised against him? May he be slain, like a wild beast, wherever he may be met, without further ceremony?—No.—It is as much a part of the law, that, if he be a murderer, he shall die, in a certain way, as that he shall die at all. And it is the duty of a great and good man, to see that the law is ministered to him, in severity and strictness;—and to protect him, at the risk of his life—against any irregularity. And this, not so much the sake of the criminal, as for that of society. And the Judge, if he be an honest man, and a lawyer, will do the same;—nay, he will set the prisoner free, though he be reeking with blood, from head to foot; the blood of his own mother and children, if you please, rather than press against one of the technicalities of the law. Nay, the prosecutor, himself, the Attorney General, vol.ii. X if he feel his tremendous obligation to society, will abandon the cause, if there be a substantial errour in the indictment, or proceedings, to justify him; rather than admit a precedent for errour, or carelessness. Nay, he will stand up, and tell the jury, like a man, that it is no matter what they may believe;—that is not the question—that they must acquit the prisoner, though they may believe him, in their hearts, to be guilty—unless he be proved to be so; nay, more—though one of their members may have seen the deed perpetrated, he will tell them that that makes no difference, unless that juror come out of the box and be sworn as a witness; and permit himself to be cross-examined; and that an honest jury cannot; and, if it be known to the court, that they never shall convict a man, on such evidence. Suppose that no evidence at all appears. Suppose that the jury believe the criminal to be guilty. No witness is sworn; no evidence is given. Can they find him guilty? No—for they are sworn to give their verdict “according to law and evidence.” But, suppose that illegal, or irregular evidence, which is the same thing, be given. Shall that be received? No!—for it is the same, as if none were given. And, though I have lived to see a bench, forgetting the attributes of humanity, again and again, in its appetite for blood;—a judge, hunting out his prey, like a staunch hound: turning neither to the right nor the left—and a prosecutor entering the list, forever, against the criminal; as if it were a mere trial of skill, between himself and the opposite counsel—disturbed by passion— vindictive, unforgiving, and precipitate; even in matters of life and death:—and though I have lived to see, hundreds and hundreds of criminals, sent off to their places of punishment, with as little decency, and as little emotion, as if they were so many cattle;—just called up; arraigned in a hurried manner—asked, what they have to say for themselves—and their case left to the jury, under the representation of the prosecutor. Though I have lived to see all these things; yet, I hope to see something better, before I die. I hope to see a court of criminal justice, a place of reverential silence....imposing solemnity....and manly, brief eloquence. I hope to hear the indictment read aloud, and firmly; the oath administered to a witness, as if he stood up, in the very presence of the Everlasting God: and counsel assigned in every case, as a matter of course;—yet, forbidden to declaim; or to ramble in their argument—and, prohibited from all rhetorical displays. I would have it a court of justice; not a school of declamation;—a place for lawyers and men; not for rhetoricians. Nay, Stafford—to recur, for a moment, to the lawyer and client. I will go further. So haughtily sensitive should he be; so righteous and steady—that I would have him state all that appears against his client, with the most scrupulous distinctness and accuracy. I would have him disdain all mere legal advantages. But I would have him exquisitely sensible, and jealous of illegal ones. Thus, if a doctrine were advanced, which he could not overlook; and could not refute, I would have him admit it, like a man; on the contrary, though it went against his prisoner, I would have him trample it in the dust, if it were false. Suppose that he was the counsel of a quaker, for felony, at the Old Bailey. He might complain that the law would not permit quakers to affirm, in criminal cases. But, he would remember, immediately, that, if quakers cannot be set free, by the oath of quakers, they cannot be convicted by it; and he would abandon the point. It would be an especial hardship, in that particular case; but, as a general regulation of society, the quakers would have no reason to complain. Why should they repine, that they cannot be cleared by evidence, which cannot condemn them. The law is foolish, to be sure: or rather was—for, it has been altered. But, there is no hardship in the case. Again—suppose that the doctrine of many a writer on criminal jurisprudence; and, particularly, that of Beccaria; which is, that the greater the crime, the greater the proof to be demanded,—suppose that that doctrine were advanced by a lawyer's colleague. I would have him search into the principles—lay them bare— and never shrink from the work, till all was disclosed, whatever were the consequences. He would show that the doctrine was not true: or the application false. I would have him prove what is true—that, in proportion to the magnitude of a charge, is its unfrequency; and, consequently, the improbability of it; for charges and crimes too, become probable by becoming common.— Theft is common—parricide very rare. Consequently, you would demand more proof of parricide than of theft. The conclusion is false. Proof is always the same. You are not, to convict for the slightest offence, unless you are satisfied. You must demand the same evidence, of the particular fact, upon which a criminal is arraigned, though he may be the lowest and vilest of society, that you would to convict the greatest and best. If you do not—you are unwise and wicked. You are not the ministers of the law. It is your prejudice; and not justice that pronounces sentence. Yet no principle of criminal evidence is so little understood, and so eternally disregarded, as this. But it is false on another account. One witness, unimpeached, uncontradicted, by the English law, is enough to prove any fact. Now, says Beccaria, you shall require a greater proof of a murder, than of a theft. Why? —Because a man is less likely to commit a murder than a theft. And is not a witness less likely, pray, to charge a man falsely, with murder, than with theft? I admit that we can more readily believe a man guilty of theft, than of murder;--but I would ask, if it be not more likely that a witness has perjured himself, when he charges a man with murder, than with theft: assuredly—if Beccaria's principle be right, that the greater the crime, the more improbable it is. It is, therefore, more improbable that a man should swear away another's life, falsely; than, that he should swear away his property or liberty, falsely. Therefore, we should as readily believe the witness, who swears to a murder; as the one that swears to a theft. If Beccaria's principle be true, that, in proportion to the magnitude of the crime, is its improbability—then is his conclusion absurd; and mine established. Thus, freely, and boldly should an honest man tread down the nonsense of the books, when it comes fairly in his way—however it may affect his client. He is the advocate of society, not of an individual—of a priesthood, whose office it is, to minister, with clean hands, even at the sacrifice. What think you now, dear Stafford, of a lawyer, who should defend an acknowledged criminal?—what, of him, who defends a doubtful one; which is the true case, nine hundred and ninety-nine times out of a thousand. He hears his client's story;—and, make what allowance he may, he will find it false in some particulars; for there is a strange propensity, in all men, to aggravate their sorrow, and conceal their danger, even from themselves. Thus, a patient rarely tells the whole truth of his case—nor a merchant in failing circumstances—even to himself—and a client, never. All are deceived, by their own hopes, or their passions; and who shall determine? But let me take a strong case. You have not forgotten that despot of New Orleans—Jackson:—nor his murder of your two agents. They deserved death. I admit it. So, many a criminal deserves death—but still it is murder, to slay him without the form of trial. As well, might a judge descend from the tribunal; tuck up his gown, and let out the prisoner's blood at the bar, because he was satisfied of his guilt. No—the basest and wickedest have some right to guard; rights that are the dearer to them, because of their fewness;—and because they are tugged at, by every merciless hand in the community—though the agony thereof, is like that of the heart-strings—in their quivering tenacity.—And an honest man will take care to protect them. I told you something of the mail robbers, here. Your blood curdled. It was pleaded for one, that he was young—merciful God!—a mere boy!—yet he had the strength to drive his knife—slowly—into the heart of a man, old enough to be his father—bound—helpless— and upon his knees. What would he have been, at maturity!— vol. ii. X 2 He confessed his guilt. The money was found upon him. His partner confessed also. But their stories did not agree. Here was enough to justify their condemnation, one would think:—and enough to deter any man, in his senses, from defending them. You would have thought him that had attempted it, a madman. Yet—put yourself on guard, Stafford. Notwithstanding all this—all! —the younger might have been innocent; nay, the elder. And I do believe, to this moment, that an able man might have saved one of them. Whether it would have been right to do so, is another question. But follow me for a moment. To doubt is to acquit. It is better that ninety-nine guilty escape, than that one innocent man suffer. So says the law. (But I think differently—what has the innocent man to fear from death?) Is confession enough? Let us see. Men have confessed murders, that were never perpetrated. There is a case of a man executed for the murder of another, on his own confession, who proved to be alive long afterward. True—he had been left for dead. There was an affair too, but the other day, in Vermont, where a father and son confessed a murder, and all its particulars; even to the destruction of the bones, by fire,—and bones were found in the place described, reduced to chalk. Yet—the murdered man was alive; and returned, in season, to prevent their execution. One of the two, had beaten him—he became delirious— and disappeared. How is this matter to be explained? Thus. Each knew the deadly hostility of the other, against their victim.— Each had beaten him, at times, and threatened his life. Each believed, therefore, when he disappeared, that the other had slain him. Both were taken up on suspicion. Each believed the other to be guilty. There was one chance left; and only one, to save one of them from death, by circumstantial evidence. It was to confess. Each, therefore, charged himself with a crime, that he never committed; in the hope of saving his own life, by being admitted state's evidence. He did not mean to bear false witness against an innocent man—but against a guilty one—and against himself, for his own preservation. Again---is circumstantial evidence to be conclusive— even when united to confession. It may be—but is it certain? Is there no room for doubt? In this very case, the bones were found;—the threat, of death by father and son, was proved—their mutual reproaches,—their unquiet and miserable life;—and the sudden and total disappearance of the man, supposed to be murdered. Yet they were innocent. In a French work,[26] [26] LES CAUSES CELEBRES—probably.—Ed. that I have seen, are some cases, of a most extraordinary nature, where the innocence of persons that have suffered death, upon circumstantial evidence, has appeared, years and years afterward. Our English books, too, are full of them; and every year some new case is coming to light. Heaven only knows what a multitude may remain undiscovered, until we are all arraigned,—the murdered and the murderers—the Judge and the criminal—the advocate and the jury,—before one tribunal! There is a case in Scotland—where a man was executed for the murder of his daughter. She was heard to pronounce her father's name;—he had treated her harshly, at times—and she was found with her throat cut—and he in the next room, with his heart beating as if it would burst its way out—and pretending to be asleep. He was hung. Years afterward, some old furniture was removed; or some repairs made, and letters, in the hand writing of the girl, were found, showing that she had deliberately destroyed herself. A man, of a cruel disposition, was arraigned for the murder of his niece. She had disappeared, unaccountably, many months before; immediately after the shrieking of a voice, like hers, had been heard in a wood.— Alarmed at his danger—he produced another child before the court. The counterfeit was detected; and he was hung. Yet the girl was alive—and reappeared. He had whipped her severely in the wood; and she had run away. A young man was hung, on the testimony of his own sister, for the murder of his own father. A hammer was found, “the grey hair sticking to the haft,” with which the skull of the old man had been beaten in. The track in the snow, corresponded with the son's shoes. Yet the daughter afterward confessed, that she was the murderess—that she had worn her brother's shoes; and placed the hammer where it was found, on purpose to destroy him. A man departed to receive some money, in company with another, of an ill name. He was no more heard of. They had been seen drinking together in the evening; and the survivor could give no account of his companion. He was hung. Years afterwards, the body was found, with the money in the pocket, in a vault, at the house where they had stopped. The floor had been taken up; and he had fallen through, while intoxicated. Another was executed for the murder of his guest. Two travellers were awakened at night, by the noise of some one gasping. They saw a man, with a dark lantern, and a bloody knife, standing over a third, who was expiring. Yet, many years afterward, the truth appeared. He was not the murderer. His servant was; and had fled. But he, too, had probably gone to the bed-side, or the purpose of murdering his guest. There is another case. A traveller was robbed of twenty pieces of gold, all marked. He came to a tavern, and took the landlord aside, and mentioned the mark. After he had gone to bed, the landlord came to him, and showed him a guinea, which was immediately recognised. “It was returned to me, by my servant,” said he, “this evening. I had sent him out for change—and when he returned, unable to get it changed, he gave me this.” They went to the servant's room, and found him asleep. In his pocket, were the other nineteen guineas. He was hung. Yet, the master was the true robber; and confessed it afterward. The mark alarmed him. He had passed one of the guineas, without observing it; and destroyed the poor fellow to save himself. But why prolong the enumeration? It is painful to go over the place where innocent blood hath been shed. The books are full of such cases. What then are we to do? Depend upon circumstancial evidence. No. Reject it entirely? No. But let us exercise a sound discretion. Apply this to Hull. He has confessed. But that is not conclusive, you see. A part of the money is found upon him—he is seen in company with Hutton, before and after the murder. Are these circumstances sufficient?— Are they not capable of some explanation; consistent with a less degree of guilt than he stands charged with? That he is innocent, I cannot pretend—but may he not, possibly, be less than a murderer? Let me suppose a case. Hundreds may be imagined—but I will content myself with one or two. Suppose that Hull had known Hutton; and his desperate character: that they had consulted together, to murder the mail-driver; that Hull had refused—or, that he had gone out; as he had once, and that his heart had failed him;—that, afterward, the murder is perpetrated, by Hutton alone. The moment that Hull hears of it; he knows well whose hand it was, that struck the blow. He goes to Hutton. You are the man, he says. Your life is in my power. Give me a part of the spoil, or I will bring you to justice. Hutton consents. The money is found upon Hull. What can he do? Publick opinion is crying for his blood. He has no defender. The very judges put him to the question. No counsel visit him. He feels that he must die. There is only one chance of escape. It is this—to confess a participation in the crime; in the hope of being admitted as a witness for the state. What man would not do the same, in his case! Show me the godlike nature, that will submit to an ignominious death; go down to his grave, in blood, accursed and dishonoured—when a single word may save him—and give him an opportunity of establishing his innocence at some future day. Think of this, Stafford. Imagine yourself upon the jury—clothed, even in your infirmities, with the chief attribute of Almighty God, the power of life and death. Remember how many innocents have suffered—how abundant that testimony need be, to satisfy you—how terrible are our prejudices—how sleepless will be your agony, if you find; or ever imagine hereafter, that you have been spilling innocent blood. And were you upon your death bed—crying for mercy—would there be no consolation in the thought, that you had shown mercy, at such an hour, in the extremity of mortal apprehension, even to the most bloody of criminals. Nay—it is your voice—yours, alone, Stafford—that pronounces judgment of death upon this man. Are you satisfied? Beware how you are influenced by your companions. If you yield to them, without being thoroughly convinced of his guilt—you are no better than a murderer. Yet— how often is this done! Men shift off the weight of obligation, as they would that of blood, upon each other.— Suppose that you were alone, upon your judgment seat; and no one to divide with you, the sacrifice. Would the evidence, that you have heard, be sufficient to satisfy you? Would you venture to pronounce the judgment of death alone? You would not. Then, you are a murderer, if you yield to your companions. What!—is this a time for complaisance—this!—when a fellow creature stands shivering and death-struck before you; awaiting, it may be, his everlasting doom, from his fellow man. Thus much for lawyers, dear Stafford. What is your opinion now, of their right and duty, even in cases of the most atrocious nature?—and do you feel as clearly, as you did, that, CONFESSION and circumstantial evidence are conclusive? Thursday. Our Tragedians.—We have only one; and he is a countryman of yours. His name is Cooper, and he is somewhat of the Kemble School; cold, stately and declamatory;—with a noble person; the stature of a king; and the voice of a hero.— In some characters, he is amazingly great. His Virginius, for example, is terrible---full of sublimity. And there are parts in his Bertram, that would awe and shake the sternest nature;—and other parts that would subdue it, at times, even to compassion and tears. On two or three occasions, where he has been alone, unaided; and left, utterly to his own conception of the part, he has stood, all at once, before me, like an apparition from another world; strong with individual, distinct, and vivid conception—altogether new and astonishing. At times too, there is a sort of regal simplicity in his manner—something like the carriage of a monarch, abandoned of all the world, and left to his own resources. Thus, I have known him to play his Virginius, to a full house, every man of whom, perhaps, went away satisfied;—but he was not—his forehead gathered—he repeated the part; and so utterly different a being, did the Roman father appear; that they, who felt familiar with him at first; and thought that a departure from that picture, would be a departure from truth, were amazed and confounded at their own blindness, when they saw him again. Virginius was no longer the same man. How often this may happen. Take a case—Richard rushes in; and, with the voice of a trumpet, calls out, a horse! a horse! my kingdom for a horse! This is thought fine and natural. It is the commonest conception in the world—and, therefore, the most natural. But an ambitious man, will not travel in a common road. He staggers in upon you, therefore, like one overwhelmed with battle—exhausted and faint with toil —his fierce spirit shooting out of his eyes:—but he cannot articulate a cry—he is choked and blinded with dust and sweat—and, if his voice be heard so loudly, what is it, but to do that which no mortal man could do, at such a moment—hot, hoarse and smoking—from the field—beside, it is inviting the enemy upon him. And that is not a very natural imprudence, in the wily Richard. The actor thinks of all this—he reels in—he braces himself—he looks about him, like a dethroned monarch, just struck to the earth—and gasping for breath—he utters a cry of desolation and bereavement. And the audience are thunderstruck with the novelty and beauty of the conception. But a third one appears. He disdains to follow anybody. He knows that all men act differently---and kings, as well as men. And that the greatest men, are full of contradiction. It is not even necessary therefore, than he should be consistent. He leaps upon the stage like a madman---like a lion baffled of his prey; snorting with passion; his nostrils distended, and his blood rattling in his chest---“a horse! he cries---“a horse!—my kingdom for a horse!” You wonder at the tone—but the meaning strikes you like electricity. Richard is no longer a king---he is no longer battling for the crown. Blood! blood! blood! is all that he covets now—the blood of Richmond—and for that, he offers up kingdom, crown and all—but not in a loud voice—no—that were folly and cowardice—the brave man is more of a devil than that—he calls for a horse, as he would call down the thunders of heaven—by a deep, deep voice, of unutterable meaning, like an incantation. But lo! a fourth!—Behold him!---he has just entered, like one, to whom battle is a sport—a pastime; blood, a liquid to dabble in—he looks at his sword—his eye follows the stain that trickles down it—he wipes his forehead—he takes his garment in his hand, as if it were saturate with the slaughter, through which he had trailed. You can fancy that the steam reaches him—and is grateful. But why is he there? He has just slain another Richmond—and coldly too, without passion, without noise. Suddenly his eyes flash—his form dilates—he sees the enemy at hand; and he is on the point of shouting—when he recollects that he is unhorsed—what is he to do?—in the bitterness of his spirit—he clenches his hands, and offers his kingdom to God—nay, to the devil, for a horse—while the malignity of hell, itself, is leering from his eyes. Another appears, like an evil spirit—who does not fight himself; but merely looks on the battle at a distance---sneering and cool. When he utters the cry, he stands like one that sees a horse dashing athwart the field---within call---masterless. Thus you see, my dear Stafford, how endlessly a character; nay, a single sentence may be varied, by a man of energy. So with Talma. So with Mrs. Siddons. So, beyond all other men, is it with Keane—and so, with young Mr. Booth, whose Lear is one of the greatest pieces of acting, that I ever saw. Talma's nature, is the nature of the poet, and the dramatist; sublime, stately and overpowering; but rarely, if ever, that nature, of which all men are able to judge. It is too grand, too deliberate; and his awful countenance, in its wrath, is too kingly for reality.— Your Kemble, I can't bear. I hate his vast action, and pompous nothingness of voice. Mrs. Siddons, too—but I must not pretend to judge of her. I never saw her but once; and that was in lady Randolph. I was prepared to expect too much— and it was some time before I began to feel satified with either her, or myself. At that moment, she electrified me. Glenalvon quailed before her—and throughout the rest of the piece, there was a distinctness, a dignity, a beauty, and majesty, that brought my spirit of criticism prostrate before her. There is young Wallack too, James—he will be, if he be industrious, a great actor, after a few years. He is full of genius—passion—and power.[27] [27] The other is a blockhead—if not something much worse.—Ed. I was unlucky enough not to see Miss O'Neale.— And you know well my opinion of Mr. Keane—a compound of madness, folly, and genius—daring to an excess—presumptuous to the same degree—and disdaining all resemblance. In that, he is right—I like him for that. But he runs into such alarming extremes.—In avoiding any given mode, he is sure to caricature the very originality of his own thought. Thus, when others are distinguished—in any particular passage--his first question is. Does it depend upon personal dignity?—grace?—beauty?—or a fine, powerful voice? If yes—he shuffles it over, without ceremony, as something beneath him. But if not—he enters the temple bravely; locks his hands; and gives it, in his own manner, and as much unlike any other actor as possible. Take that passage in Othello—the farewell, you know. Keane has been trumpetted te the four winds of heaven for that. But how unnatural it is,—nay, how unsoldierlike. It is the whine of a field preacher, at his exhortation. But Othello is his masterpiece. It is really wonderful, at times, except that his hysterical laughing and crying vol. ii. Y are too frequent;—and his passion is too vociferous and inarticulate, in the handkerchief scene.—There he is monstrous. But the play, itself, is an accursed thing; and I won't waste another thought upon it—except to say that I never heard the speech before the Senate, spoken as a soldier would speak it, in all my life. “True —I have married her;” they all say. But why do they not say—true—I have married her. A soldier, like the noble Moor would:—By that emphasis, he says—yes: I have done it—help yourself. Another trick of Keane's;—and one of his best, is this. Whenever he comes to an insignificant, worthless passage, which nobody remembers, or cares for—he puts forth all his power, no matter how preposterously; and startles us with his manner, articulation, or attitude. We are amazed. Gracious heaven! exclaim the mob. What a genius he has! How superior to A. B. C. &amp;c. How different it appears, now! We never saw that before! And then the simple creatures take it for granted that, as he is astonishingly great, in trifles; he must therefore be, although they, may-hap, cannot see it, astonishingly great, in matters of moment. But he is not. In one word—Keane might have been the wonder of the age—with better training, a better voice, and a better person. He has talent enough for it:—but it is a perverted, abused talent. But we have a woman here, that must not be forgotten---a most extraordinary creature. She is the sister of Anacreon Moore's wife---the mother of eleven children, seven of whom are yet living:---only twenty-nine years of age;---and, altogether, the most dignified and beautiful woman that I ever saw on the stage. She is no actress---but she is the express and eloquent image of human nature. I know not how to describe her; or what peculiarity to mention, as an attribute, by which you can get a notion of her. Figure to yourself a noble looking creature, with large, dark eyes---and black hair ---with a Greek face---above the common height---apparently not more than twenty-four---who, in all the terrible, and in all the tender passions, goes down into your very heart at once. No man, I believe, in my con science can look at her without trembling, in her times of passionate outcry---or without quaking all over, when madness and grief are upon her--or--when her sweet voice is dying away in supplication---or—but I must be done with this, or you will think me a foolish blockhead. Yet, believe me, Stafford---all that I say, is true. You have never seen such acting as this in England---by any woman. Her name is Duff---her husband is an actor ---but barely tolerable.[28] [28] Where is Mr. Pelby? He is an actor of great promise—and an American.—Ed. Of Politicks and Religion, I have nothing to say. I never meddle with either. My notion of the latter are peculiar; and not especially orthodox. I hold that every man is accountable to his God—and to his God alone—for his thought and opinion;—and to society, only for his conduct. And, of the former, I am superlatively ignorant, and desire to remain so. I have no fondness for troubled waters,—particularly when their vapour and ebullition are offensive and blinding. You spoke of the Bible—and you are anxious to know whether my opinion has changed of it. It has. I revere it, now—and never permit myself to dispute about it. Is not that a mark of my reverence?—There are few things, you know, about which I do not dispute. Yet I am not blinded in my reverence. I have the courage to think, as usual; and to depend upon my own reason, as I always have; and as I hope that I always shall, until God sees fit to take it from me. I can see in the parables, however beautiful, some strange things. Thus, the parable of the unjust steward teaches, too plainly, I think, that it is wisdom to cheat our employers. Perhaps I have not called it by the right name. I am a heretick---and not very tenacious of titles. But I allude to the steward, who discharges the debtors of his master, by taking obligations for a less amount. And there is another---a very strong case. Our Saviour bids a certain lawyer to love his neighbour. The lawyer, “tempting him,” demands who is his neighbour? ----Christ answers, with the parable of the good Samaritan;----from which it follows, that the neighbour, of a man, is he who does him kind offices; pours oil into his bruised heart,---and that he, who passes by on the other side, is not a neighbour. Such is the doctrine of the parable. But such is not the doctrine of Christ. He teaches that all mankind are neighbours---our enemies--- they that despitefully use us; that even they are our neighbours. Else, where would be the merit of our loving them? Where the merit in the man that fell among thieves, in loving the good Samaritan?---Yet this answer was given to a lawyer; and the lawyer did not reply. I am not blinded I say---I can see these things, and feel sorry that so pure and perfect a system of morals, should be liable to any such objection. So too, in the matter of miracles. I cannot say that I believe in them; for I have never properly examined the testimony that relates to them, nor the prophecies. But when I am able to, I shall, though it would require a sound, critical acquaintance, with the original languages in which they were written. And I dare not say that I disbelieve them---that were, as men think, to blaspheme. But I can smile at the folly of them that believe, whatever they are taught. I have no such accommodating belief. I trust to my senses---till I have reason to distrust them; and then I appeal to my reason. For example. I cannot imagine, at this moment, how it would be possible to convince me of a miracle. I say this, honestly; and, I hope, not presumptuously---- for God knows my heart---he knows that I would shrink from no trial, no peril, no proof---and that I would go down upon my knees to any man, who would convince me that I am wrong. Thus---suppose that I was to see a dead man, this moment, arise and walk, at the bidding of another.--- Would I believe that he had been dead? Could I?--- would you, or any man, in his senses? No. We should fly to any hypothesis, rather than believe it---delusion, or deception---intentional or accidental. But, take some case, where we have the highest evidence of our senses, to make us believe it. Suppose that we see a body, half decayed---festering in putrefaction--- the skeleton, quite bare—and the flesh dissolving in greenness. A being, in the fashion of a man, commands it to arise, and come forth! It obeys. We see the process of re-creation---the bones rattle, and are rejoined---the sinews knit themselves together; and the flesh reappears. The body comes forth. We see it. All our senses are convinced. But is our understanding? No. We cannot believe. Our reason re-establishes her dominion: and we distrust our very senses, rather than believe. I could more easily believe that my senses were disordered; for, such things are common—that the whole appearance was a vivid dream, (for such things are of daily occurrence)---in short, any thing and every thing which was more probable, than the resurrection of such a body. I should shut my eyes. I should reflect. I might go to prayer---weep, perhaps---but I should never believe that what I had seen, was other than the creature of delusion. Nay, I might wish to believe it. I might try —terrified by the denunciations of man—but could I?— that is the question: could I believe it, though I wished it? Have you never dreamed so distinctly, that, when you awoke, the creatures that you had dreamt of, appeared to be still standing before you? What did you? You strove to be more awake. So would I—and I should be sure that I never was truly awake, until I had ceased to see them. I find, every day, that my senses deceive me. I walk into the woods; and I hear my name called. I enter a room, and some odour assails me---whence, I know not. No such odour is there. I put a straight stick into the water. It appears crooked. I cross my fingers, and roll a pea under them---and I could swear that there were two peas. Thus, I find that there are times, when I cannot depend upon my sight, feeling, smell, or hearing. What, then, am I to do?---reject their evidence, altogether? No. That were absurd; but, I will trust to them, wherever there is no higher, or better evidence; and in all the common occasions of life. Again.---I go to a juggler. I do not say this, irreverently. I am confounded, by the rapidity, and beauty of his deceptions. My temples throb. I am deceived. But, do I believe that what I see, is real? No:---for, if I vol. ii. Y 2 did, I should believe in a miracle. Yet, I have the evidence of my senses. True---but I, like every other man, appeal to a higher power, reason. My reason tells me, that my senses are deceived. It was not long since, there was an exhibition in Boston, called the Androides. There is an inconceivable mystery in them. They are little figures, that do many different things at your bidding. Among them, was a telegraph, with six letters upon it; to which were attached six strings---three of which were held in one hand, three in the other, of a little figure, upon the table. Another telegraph, corresponding with it, and portable, was placed at a distance. No connexion could be imagined between them. There was no place to conceal, even a clock, in the machinery. You were at liberty to make any signal, upon this; from one, to six letters, with all their combinations; it was instantly answered, by the figure. Nay, a little dial was given to you, with an index, pointing to certain signals. You might take the dial into your own hands; set the pointer where you pleased---and the figure would give the signal required. What was I to think of this?—if I trusted to my senses, —for it was impossible to discover any connexion between the two telegraphs—nay, even to imagine how it could be—they would tell me that this was all magick; nay, miraculous. But in such a case, who would trust to his senses? Not an intelligent man, surely. I saw, that nothing, but some secret intelligence, could effect this; but, it was quite as inconceivable, how any intelligence could exist, and how operate, without detection; as that the whole should be only the result of mechanical combination. An ignorant man, a North American savage, would call it magick; a South Sea Islander, “the work of the devil;” in which opinion, probably, a Scotchman would join. But, a man of experience would give himself no trouble about the matter; sure that there was some deception, though it were impossible for him to imagine what, in it. You see, therefore, that I could not believe in a miracle, were it wrought in my very presence. Would I be more likely to believe it then, because others testified to it, centuries ago—when men could be imposed upon, much more easily than now? Understand me—I do not mean to question the honesty of their witnesses; nay, nor of him that is supposed to have wrought them. I only say that, if they had been wrought, they would not have been believed—and were not believed; or, why were others, that saw them, unconverted? And where would be the good of such miraculous labours? Give to any man, the power of healing, whom he will, by a touch; and the gift would be a curse. Practised, indiscriminately, as it was, it would take away all terrour from criminal indulgence; and tempt men into every excess, and every peril. Beside, do we not find that there were others, that cast out devils, as well as the followers of Christ? others that wrought miracles? (but they were magicians) in Egypt, as well as Aaron? Others, that interpreted dreams, as well as Daniel? Others, that could make the grave give up the dead, beside Christ—and many false prophets? What, then, are we to believe? Not that the Bible is an imposition. No—that were to reason foolishly, indeed. For, the very fact, that it is recorded in so many places that other men did deeds, which were miraculous, is an unquestionable proof of honesty, in the record. But, were they deceived, they that bear this testimony? I believe that they might have been. And, it is possible that we have not their testimony, exactly as it was given; or that, we do not understand the wisdom, and power, and purpose of Christ. But, enough. I have entered deeply, more deeply than I intended, into these mysteries; but, as the Lord liveth! Stafford, it were better for me to encounter His wrath, than that of society, if they suspected me of entertaining such opinions. They would think little of roasting me alive. We talk a great deal here, about toleration—humanity—and freedom. But, we know little, or nothing, of either. A want of power only, prevents the orthodox from annihilating us. They do all that they can, toward it, now. A Jew cannot hold any office of trust or confidence, military or civil; nay, he cannot be an attorney of a paltry court, in several of our states, without swearing to his belief in the Christian religion! What an oath! Any man might take it, safely, whatever he believed. What is the meaning of it? And of our humanity, you may judge, from the fact, that, a few weeks ago, there was a negro burnt to death; thrown, alive, into a bonfire, at the south, and burnt to death, for murder. This hath set the four corners of America declaiming. Yet, where is the mighty matter? Hanging had been tried. It did not succeed. Were the people to stay their hands then; and let the work of blood go on, in their planters' habitations? What is the purpose of punishment? To reform the criminal; prevent him from repeating the offence; and others from imitating him. Would not burning be as likely a mode of reformation, as hanging? And his ashes, one would think, would be, at least, as unable to repeat the offence, as his skeleton. And the very uproar that has been made about this matter, is a proof that burning is more terrifick than hanging, to the minds of men. At least, the experiment was worth trying. And, they who understand the true end of punishment, will never spare, upon a criminal, any experiment, which may promote the welfare of society. A word or two now, dear Stafford, upon the politicks of our country, the government, and opinion—and I have done, probably, till I see you in person; and, perhaps, forever—for I am really wearied of life—worried, chafed, and haunted;—yea, Stafford, haunted by spectres and bloodhounds—day after day, night after night. But this will not last forever. It cannot. Nay, it shall not. I will sooner die, at once—than pant and pant, forever, in this way, after that unattainable good; that something pure and holy, which I was born to believe in—only at a distance. No, Stafford, I cannot bear it. I have deserved a better fate—you never heard me complain. No mortal man ever heard me—and the words sound strangely to my own ears—but I am, now, almost ready to give up. My life has been one of sacrifice. Yet, to whom is it known? I have done that for virtue—love— ambition—that would have honoured—tears!— * * * * * By heaven, Stafford, it is too bad. Tears from my eyes! * * * * No!—let me arise, and go forth in the night air. That may quell the spirit within me, and—* * * * I have been abroad, Stafford—but I am far from being quieted. I have seen it, again; yet, I do not tremble.— Look at my writing. Is there any trace, here, of an unsteady hand? If there be, I cannot see it. I have had a dream, Stafford. You smile. You wonder to hear me speak of dreams; for I am not of that people, who see prophecy in them. I have known men and women, whose dreams always “came out.” They would dream of death; or a white horse; or some such trash. They would live disquieted, till some neighbour, or friend, broke his neck, or his leg; or their lap-dogs got scalded; or some china shattered—when their hearts would beat lightly again. “Their dream would be out.” And so, too, happen what would—a wedding, or a death—a party, or a christening; or an unexpected visit—certainly the dream would be out, then, because dreams go by contraries. But, I am no such man. You will believe me, therefore, when I say, in sincerity, that a dream has terrified me; that, I am weak as an infant, at times, in thinking of it; and, that I am fully persuaded that my death is near at hand—some terrible death, too. Would that I knew what, or where it was to be met—I would not endure this feeling another hour. It came to my bed-side;— it—For shame—for shame.—Let me return to the subject. You desire to know something of our constitution, our boasted liberty. Let me tell you what it is. It is a shadow. Look at our Declaration of Independence. It is there said, that life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness are unalienable rights. The devil they are! Then how comes it, if our right to life and liberty are unalienable; that we have alienated it so far, to our representatives, as to allow them a power over our life and liberty, to be used at their discretion. What does it mean? It means nothing; or, it means that we cannot dispose of our life or liberty---by any compact. This disgraceful nonsense is to be found in the declaration of rights, or the constitution of Virginia, and some other states;---nay, it was borrowed from that of Virginia; and the new state of Maine has just adopted it, in her wisdom. What a pity, that men will not think, when they are disposed to talk. A friend of mine, I know, took care to point out this absurdity, in season, to one John Holmes, the chairman of a committee, appointed to report a constitution for the new state---but such men are not to be stopped in their blundering. It is their privilege---their prerogative. What they should say, is utterly different from what they have said. They should say, that our right to liberty and life are indestructible, but by our own compact and agreement. Not that they are unalienable; for, if they were, there could be no society, no government, no subordination, no security. The freedom, of which we boast, dear Stafford, is exactly like that of Moscovy under Peter. The minority are free only, in proportion to their strength. The majority are always tyrants, in all ages; and under all forms of government, exactly in proportion to their power. And that majority may exist in one man, or in one million. It is a majority, not of population, but of power. Take an example. We boast of our freedom. The majority resolve upon a war with a nation, whom the minority love as their own brothers. Yet, war is declared. The minority are driven into the ranks by a conscription, called here a militia quota; and, what is worse, they are not only compelled to bayonet their friends and brothers; but to pay others for doing it.---- Dare they complain? They are honest men---republicans---a faction---or rebels---as they happen to be weaker, and more weak. If, formidable in strength and talent, they are listened to, respectfully, and reasoned with. If a little less so, they are denounced, as the enemies of their country. A degree less makes them traitors, whom it is lawful to extirpate. Such is our freedom; such our unalienable right to life and property. But descend a step lower---down to the state governments. I have a spot of land that is dear to me;---the bones of my children sleep in it;---the heart of her, that I loved, is crumbling under the very tree, where our lips first met. Money cannot buy it from me. I am looking to it, as my last place of refuge. I meddle with nobody. I am a quiet, melancholy man, only waiting for re-union with my babes and my wife. But the state orders a road to be opened through my parlour---over the sepulchre of my family---the hallowed of many generations. And lo! it is done. The holiest place upon this earth, to a husband and a father, is invaded by the pick-axe and the shovel---the dishonoured relicks of a family are tumbled about, under the brutal ribaldry of day labourers. God! it were better that my wife and children had been buried in the publick highway, with the common malefactor! Yet this is liberty. This is the unalienable right of property. Mine is taken from me, without my consent---and my family tombs are broken up, with as little ceremony, as one would dislodge a wild beast. Go still lower. I dwell in town. I own a house. I can just manage to make both ends of the year meet. “My house is my castle,” I am told. Yet the officers of justice break into it, when they please, if a debtor or a criminal have escaped to it. My property is my own, unalienable---yet I am taxed for paving streets; sinking drains; building party walls; until I am obliged to sell my little patrimony, to pay it. My liberty is unalienable, too---yet I am sent to prison. I am insulted, trodden on, scorned. I smite my adversary to the dust. My life is unalienable, say these statesman---yet my life follows my property——. Take another case of the state of society here. A man beats another---some one perhaps, that is half his size; and old enough to be his father---and is the father of a large family. What is to be done? Shall the father call him to the field; and put up his own body, with the hearts of half a dozen blessed creatures, at the same time, to be shot at, by a ruffian? No---he shall appeal to the laws of his country. He shall go, proudly, before a jury of men and fathers, and say—Behold me. I do not take the law into my own bands. I dare not spill his blood. But I ask you to discountenance such outrage. What shall be the measure of damages? Let each man ask his own heart. Is it the actual cost of his physician's and tailor's bill? No, it is that which will deter the overbearing, forever, from ministering to their own passions, by violence;---it is to be that, which will make men appeal to you with confidence. All this is very well, the jury will tell you; and, perhaps, give you, for damages, about half enough to reimburse you for your counsel fees. It is too good a joke, a matter of this sort, to be treated seriously. What is the consequence? The injured man goes away, smarting with the reiterated indignity; his blood boiling in his veins—set upon vengeance—determined never again to refer the question from his own right hand, to any court or jury. And how fares it with the aggressor?— Is he the better, wiser, or safer, for these paltry damages? No!—it were better for him, that his blood had been let out upon the spot—that the bruised spirit of the other had been appeased by any damages. Adieu---forever and ever---adieu! ED. MOLTON.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SPENCER RANDOLPH TO SARAH RAMSAY. Something has happened to your friend. She has not gone; and, in passing the house just now, I found the lower windows shut—crape upon the door, and lights moving about, hurriedly, in the western chamber, in which you told me that she slept. Let not this alarm you—you have a strong mind; and, with this timely notice, may fortify yourself. I entreat you not to move hand nor foot, until you hear from me again. Events of a terrible nature are at hand; and we know not who may be called upon, for his part in the drama. Mr. Omar is here. I have seen him; but I am able to discover, already, by one half hour's acquaintance, that he is a hasty, intemperate young man; rash and sudden in his opinions, and never steadily awaiting their confirmation. He does not know that I am Randolph; nor do I desire that he should; but I leave the matter entirely in your hands. And now, Sarah, dear Sarah, prepare yourself. To-morrow you shall hear from me, again. SPENCER RANDOLPH. Monday Evening.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">JOHN TO SARAH. Monday Morning. Sarah—Sarah!—return immediately;—in the name of God, return! Juliet is dying!—her babe is dying! Molton is at her bed-side, night and day. I know not what to imagine, what to think; but some tremendous intelligence. I cannot get an opportunity to speak to him.— Some intelligence, I know not what, contained in a newspaper, has done this. O, return, return, Sarah!— Lose not a moment, as you would preserve all on this earth that is dear to you. I cannot go for you—I cannot leave Juliet. JOHN OMAR.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">JOHN TO SARAH. Tuesday. Grenville is dead! Helen is dead! O God, all the world is going to wreck and ruin! Juliet is now, now, even at this moment, breathing her last, it may be; and her babe, the loveliest creature, by heaven, that ever was born of woman, is shutting its dear little eyes. O, Sarah, how can I relate it!—it cannot live—it cannot; and there is Molton, there!—weeping upon Juliet's hand!—I can see him at this moment. And Helen, righteous heaven!— there is her poor face, discoloured and frightful in its vol. ii. Z beauty, just turning deadly pale. I could almost lay this hand upon her lips, I can see her so distinctly. A letter—no, it was'nt a letter. I know not how the intelligence came; but Juliet was breakfasting; and had taken up a newspaper, from many that lay upon the table, with the letters of the day; when Molton broke suddenly into the room, pale, frightfully pale—it was too late—the very paper was already in her hand! He had just time to prevent her falling; when she was borne off to her room, the whole family in horrour and consternation. Molton was distracted. He burnt the paper before the eyes of the servant; and sent immediately for me. I arrived, and found him walking the floor; the sweat trickling down his cheeks; and his eyes red, as with a scorching fire. His hands were clenched, and black with the convulsion of the pressure. He attempted to speak—he could not—the blood stood upon his lips ---he offered me his hand---it was the hand of a dead man ---cramped with cold, like iron. “What has happened,” cried I—“tell me, what has happened?” He could not articulate a word; and we were interrupted by the arrival of several strangers. I am disturbed. I shall write again, in a moment; but this must go off as it is. JOHN OMAR.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">(Written in pencil, after the letter was sealed.) Juliet is still living—some hope—babe well. O.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">RANDOLPH TO SARAH. Philadelphia.— I have just seen Mr. S. Can it be possible that you are yet at Amboy? Yet, I am not sorry—except that you will not get my letter of yesterday. But I hope this will reach you in season, to prevent the evil effect of any reports. Have you seen Monday morning's paper? I hope not. But, if you have, let it not disturb you. We hope that the account is exaggerated. Such things generally are. You are wanted, here; but do not come—do not, I entreat you, until you hear, from me, that you are indispensable. At present, you can be of no use. I am anxious to hear from you. Why do I not? But, perhaps, you have written; and the letter is now upon the road. What has happened? How is your health? I cannot write any more. It is impossible:—but, once more, let me entreat you to be composed. Summon all your faculties. There is a tremendous scene of trial before you; but, heaven will never deny to you, the strength required to support it, if it be rightly sought after. But, why did you stay at Amboy? The more that I think of it, the more I am bewildered. So publick a place! so unprotected!—and now, that I call to mind his manner, it appears to me, that there was something mysterious in it. He appeared anxious to avoid me. Tell me the truth, Sarah. Whatever it be—that man does not live, who shall trifle with me, beloved, as I am, by such a woman! I want your answer—I am desperate. SPENCER RANDOLPH.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SARAH TO RANDOLPH. Amboy.— I am afraid to think of your countenance, Randolph, when you shall see this direction. And still more, when I reflect on the cause. You have courage—you are resentful. Are you great? Are you magnanimous? Tell me the plain truth. Can you forgive? If yea, I have a secret to communicate. If no, let me understand it, distinctly; for there has never been a trial for you, like this. I am unpleasantly situated, and somewhat anxious to depart. Several persons, whom I know, from the city, are continually passing under my window; and it is not five minutes, since all the passengers of the steam-boat, crossed the street, just within view; and I saw more than one, that would have risked blood and breath for me—to avenge an insult—and such an insult! Yet, that is not what I want. All men are quick enough, too quick, upon the scent of blood. The weak and pusillanimous never forgive. They dare not. It is only the truly great, the magnificent, who can forgive. Are you of them; or of the dastardly? Did I want blood? No. If I had, mine own hand could have let it out, upon the floor, at my very feet. Would I send him, suddenly, before his Maker? There were twenty arms, within call, ready to do my bidding. But I am above them all. I want a man that can forgive—even an insult to me, when he loves me.--- You love me, Randolph. I know it. It is criminal. I feel it. Now, then, for the trial. Let us atone for our weakness. I have been utterly---deliberately---shamefully insulted---outraged---and on thy account. Forgive the being, that did this to me---and I shall never repent that I have loved thee. It will consecrate my passion for thee; make it something holy, spiritual, as I thought it was. Canst thou? Canst thou, Randolph? O, if thou canst, I will continue to love thee, as never woman loved man, till the last breath that I draw; and trust to my heavenly Father to forgive me. Thou wilt! I feel it. I feel as if thou wert by me, and had said it. I am alone. Yet, do not come to me. I cannot bear to meet thee, yet. Farewell. I shall wait here for an answer. SARAH RAMSAY. P. S.—Juliet has sailed, of course. How were her spirits? Tell me all about it; and unite with me in prayer for her, and her excellent husband. O, how happy they will soon be!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">JOHN TO SARAH. Two days have passed; two days of such intolerable misery, my dear cousin, that I hardly have the strength to tell you whether I am dead or alive. But Juliet still lingers. There is no hope left, none; and we have parted, perhaps, for the last time. Molton is watching by her, like a brother:—there he sits, in the next room—motionless—alone—dark—and like one who hath no heart left—and will not be comforted. Not a sound escapes him. He has only left us to, to— O Sarah—what a ruin and desolation are about that man!—to see his own wife laid, at last, in all her loveliness, within the cold earth—and the heavy turf heaped upon a bosom, where he hath so often slept---ah! Yes—it is done. And all the facts, and circumstances are yet before me, with an inconceivable and burning distinctness; yet I cannot for my soul, persuade myself that they are real.—I stop—I throw down my pen—I shut my eyes—I endeavor to recollect all that has passed—I feel the wind upon my forehead,—and am half persuaded that the terrible creatures, before me, are only the phantoms of a disordered brain;—but I open my eyes. And they are still there—there!---forever there. God! how beautiful she was—and yet the frightful lustre of her eyes—her streaming black hair—her passionate voice—O, what horrible mystery was there, that so fettered her faculties, when I rushed in.—She would have told it.—I saw that---I was sure of it— again and again, she tried it, as Molton knelt by her bed side; and she clung about his neck, and wept and wept, as the hour drew nearer. “His side!” said she, twice—“His side!—Omar—there are serpents feeding there—I—I—” and twice he put his hand upon her mouth, and shook from head to foot. “But may I tell,” said she? “No,” said Molton---“No, love; let it die with thee, thou cruel woman!” “Cruel! cruel!” she echoed,—“cruel, Edward, when I am dying to make thee happy,—O Juliet, Juliet, be thou but as true to him—as—” vol. ii. Z 2 “Hush! hush! for mercy's sake, love,”—whispered Molton. I was deeply embarrassed. What was I to do? I had been sent for; and it was as much as my life was worth to leave Juliet. “Shall I remain?” said I—“What have I to do? what has happened? Helen,---madam, dear madam, what has happened?” “Come hither, Mr. Omar,” said she, reaching me her cold thin hand. “You have been the friend, almost the only friend of an injured man—I—” Molton would have stopped her, but she was resolute. “Molton!” she said. “In a few hours—a very few —I am in the world of spirits. My mind is now free. A wonderful light is upon it. For four years, thine has been a life of martyrdom. I would have it known. Nay—it is impossible now, for that to be prevented. I have already taken care that they, who are most interested in it, shall know the whole, as it is.” “O Helen!—Helen! What hast thou done!—shaken down to dust and ashes---Helen---all that I have been building up, so long, with my blood. What hast thou done?—tell me. Let us not part ungently, love? Would'st thou have me accompany thee?” “Thee?---thee, Molton a self murderer!—O, no—no —no!—much as I love thee, dear, I would rather welter in flame and darkness alone, through all eternity, than thou should'st share my peril. No, Edward, no! —But it is time that thy abused nature, love, should know it all. Mr. Omar, bear witness for me. I have written a letter to my father. God forgive him! He was a good man, but—he hath done that evil, to my husband, which God only can repair. Molton, himself, looked upon her, wondering. “So calm, Helen—yet so near the tomb.—What is the meaning of this? Is it really true? What are your intentions?” “To reveal one fact to a man, Molton, who will do thee justice, when I am where— Edward, I tremble—put thy arm under my head, love—higher, a little higher—it is awful to die, dear,—let me lean upon thy shoulder—there, there!—that will do. I have written several letters. Nay, do not look darkly upon me, do not; Edward—I cannot bear it—our time, together, is counted to us; and it were a pity to let it go by unkindly. They are all on their way. The last favour that I ask, is this—that I may tell one thing, before thee; before him, before my God, while I have life enough left.” “No!” said Molton firmly—putting his hand to his side—She saw him put it there; and it seemed to pain her—for she shut her eyes; and there was a tremulous movement of his forehead---a dark tumult over it, that alarmed me---“No! Helen, I command thee to silence, by our love---our passionate love. Why should it be told?---Is—” “Why?”---she cried, eagerly interrupting him--- “why?---to prove that thou art a god, Edward! But it is too late now. It cannot be prevented. It is told--- (his head fell upon her bosom) O, do not groan so heavily---tears too!---Edward Molton! tears from thee! ---lift up my head-- let me look at them.” “No --it is only sweat,” said Molton, faintly---wiping his forehead, “I am very weak, and my hair is wringing wet. Thou wilt not tell it, Helen.” “That is already told,” she answered, laying her hand so tenderly upon his bosom, that the tears gushed, all at once, from his eyes. “No---it is something mightier--- a secret that concerns thee. I must tell it. May I?” “I cannot answer, Helen---but, O, in mercy, spare thyself.” Here the Doctor entered---but the sentence of death was written upon his features. Helen saw it; but she was not disturbed. “I am sorry that you have come again,” said she;---“really sorry; for this taking leave is a sad affair, with women, like me. There is no hope, doctor-- I know it---I am glad of it. Farewell!” The doctor left us---but lingered---went on---lingered again---and put his handkerchief to his eyes---and shut the door. The truth burst upon me in thunder. I trembled in every joint. Helen had poisoned herself. Her face altered to the hue of death, even while she was yet speaking. I sunk into a chair---and all that I remember, of the rest that passed, is this. She asked if I knew the circumstances, under which she had married Molton,---I told her that I did not; and then she related them. “Edward,” said she, as she concluded---and her voice was so sweet and melodious, coming, it did seem, from the very innermost place of her whole heart, that I feel it yet, like the sound of a blessing in my ears--- “Edward---those gashes---the places where the iron bad worn into my wrist---the blood---all---all---look at me —prepare thyself—brace up all thy noble nature, love —It will try thee, Edward—loins and brain—more than death—art thou prepared?” “I am.” Was the answer. “Hold me nearer—tighter love, tighter to thy heart —and let me whisper it.”—Said she. They embraced—she whispered—she repeated it—the very hair of his flesh rose—and he fainted in her lap. It was long before he recovered. Her tears fell, like a rain in a high wind, upon him; but she had not the strength to raise his head; and when I attempted it, for her voice had altered; and her beautiful forehead wrought, as if Death were at his work, indeed—she forbade me—“forbear,” said she. “Listen. I have only a few moments more—ah!—that pang. I was a mad woman, when this man married me. I knew it not. My father did. But he concealed it from me; and from my first husband. I knew it not till, long and long afterward—and then I dared not tell it. I—I am well now, quite well---but here lies a man---—heaven in its mercy bless, and sustain him! and give him the wounded heart that has been dying for love of him. I attempted to raise Molton's head. Nay—let him sleep—do not move his hands—let him lie as he is, and he will be spared the pain of parting with me—O, how he hath loved that woman!—Heaven sustain her and bless her, now!—if she love him as I have loved him,—he will be to her, what he has been to me—all that woman may love; all that she ought to love. Hush! he moves—come nearer—he is dying—he cannot live long. Would that the poison which is burning here now, were doubled, trebled, so that what this hand once ministered to him, in its madness; the madness of jealousy, were withdrawn from his vitals—O, how gladly would I die, over and over again. Farewell!--farewell!---my friend! Forgive me! plead for me!---Be his friend---his defender in the cold world---and tell---tell ---tell Juliet that I forgive her---that---that---but for me, she would have been happy with him,---but I forgive her.-- I---and am now dying in expiation of it. Her husband--- O,---it is well for her---for him---for Molton---that he---went as he did---farewell!---O, God!---God!---receive my—Edward, dear----thy lips—Ed— I was alone—I know not how long. It was dark, and I knew it not; and when I awoke, there were people passing about me on tiptoe;—and I was in a strange apartment;—and there was the noise, I thought, of nailing a coffin, in the next room. I strove to awake. I succeeded. A bed was before me. I opened the curtain— they were there yet—just as I had seen them last—God only knows how long before—her lips to his—her naked arms about his neck---and his hands buried and locked in her torn tresses.----Was he dead? I had not the heart to disturb him. I sat by him---hour after hour. His chest heaved---he breathed---but he spoke not---he moved not. His lips had grown to hers. At last—I was in a trance, I believe---it appeared to me that he arose---took her hands gently---crossed them upon her bosom---kissed her, once more, while the bed shook under the pressure---and turned---calmly-- very calmly, to depart.---“Come,” said he. I started upon my feet. “Whither?”—said I. “Come!”—he repeated, “It is no place for us.” I shuddered at his voice. It was preternaturally calm. “Whither?” said I. “It is dark---very dark.” “Whither?--to the ocean, the mad house---sepulchre-- whither thou wilt.” “To Juliet's, then”---said I. “He started as if the lightning had struck him.--- “True!”---said he---“true!---I had forgot. Yes, we must not leave her. All---all must be buried. Let us go.--- But who shall bury me?---thee---I will take care of thee, Omar?---it matters not---in this populous city---it were well---Omar---yes---thou art Omar---I believe--- let us go—art thou not?” Nothing had torn me like this. I wrung his hand--- but he heeded it not. I knelt to him---but he went by me. I wept upon his feet; but he stood like one that had no life left in him. “Helen,” said I. “Ah---what musick is that?” he cried---“Helen, love ---where art thou?—” I led him to her again---he reeled---and staggered--- and the tears gushed out again, as he held her poor dead hand to his mouth. We departed. We are at Juliet's, now. Helen is—I dare not tell thee where---so beautiful!—so desperate— O—what were these mysterious meanings? Can it be that she was mad?—mad all this time; and that I knew it not—and Molton?---Did he? It may be that he did.— And can it be true, that she had poisoned him for jealousy---of whom---of Juliet herself?---this, then, was the secret, the tremendous secret, that fed upon the life of Molton. How like a dream it all appears---the pain in his side---the mortal terrour---are all clear now. Mad ---O, if he knew it, he, who was capable of concealing that he carried a perpetual death at his heart, administered by Helen; he who could love her still, watch over her, and cheer her still; he would never have betrayed it, though he had known that she was mad. And have I not seen symptoms of it, too?---I have. But her death---what could possess her? the same spirit of madness---jealousy ---Hearing, as she did of Grenville's death, she has chosen to set Molton free!—merciful heaven! what a woman she was! Omar.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">RANDOLPH TO SARAH. Philadelphia. Yes--I do forgive him. Now tell me his name, and where I can find him. It were a pity that he should not know, that I forgive him. We might meet else, by chance; and he might think it a secret for me; or that I were a dastard. I wait your answer. Mr. Molton's wife is suddenly dead; at a very critical moment, too; and the story is, by poison, administered by herself. This, say others, is incredible. The town is greatly agitated---for Mr. Grenville's death, happening just before—and Mr. Molton's reputed love for Mrs. Grenville, have given rise to no very pleasant conjectures. His death was cruel---horrible. May some of our vessels encounter the pirates, and send them to the bottom, as they sent this unhappy man---limb by limb. He appears to have been much respected;---and his wife is spoken of in the most exalted terms, except for one thing. She is blamed for her intimacy with this Molton; and yet, it is said, and believed, that Mr. Grenville expressly put her into his hands; when he departed. Strange infatuation, indeed, if he or she, be like the men and women of the earth. RANDOLPH. Your health—tell me how it is, I must try to see you, erelong. Will you permit it? Something of moment has happened to me. I will explain it, when we meet. R.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">JOHN TO SARAH. Philadelphia. Where are you, Sarah? Why are you not here? Are all my apprehensions to be verified. Am I to lose all my friends, all; one after the other!—either by death or —no I will not say it—perhaps you are sick, Sarah— perhaps my letters have not reached you—nay, it may be that you are not in New-York. Yes, I must believe it; I will believe anything, rather than that Sarah Ramsay has forgotten Juliet, at such a moment. She is constantly asking for you—and some times, when her brain turns, and the wintry blue of her touched eyes will seem dissolving over her dear little boy—she raves of Sarah, and Edward, and her husband—till we are obliged to obey Molton, and all of us abandon her to the women. She is stronger to-day; more collected; and the physician, I can perceive, begins to entertain some little hope. His voice trembles less, when he leaves the directions; and his eyes are not so dim. O, join with me, Sarah, join with me, in prayer to Him, in whose hands are life and death, to spare her yet a little longer, to her babe, if not to us! Her voice was strangely sweet and gentle last evening: and her rapt eyes, and parted lips, as her delicate murmuring passed me; had something, I know not what, that soothed the heart, even while they made it melancholy. She is anticipating death—I am sure of it; she has sent for me—desiring to see me, alone—and I have promised to be with her, early tomorrow—the doctor forbids this, but her manner, though faint, is peremptory. I shall obey her. Molton too—no, I cannot bring myself to speak of him—I love him—wonder at him, but there is, I know not what, of awe and terrour about my thought, of late, as if he were something supernatural, which prevents me from approaching him, as I used to. Sorrow like his, too, is holy:—a little indiscretion may be pardoned to such a man—but to be the only friend, the only assured and trusted one, of a woman, upon her death bed, whose husband has just been hewed, limb from limb, upon the water—O, Sarah—I cannot proceed. He stands up too, so proudly, so immoveably, against the storm, though it rain fire upon his naked heart. I know not what to think of him. But Juliet—may she recover. If she should—what then? I dare not think of it. Strange thoughts are abroad?—who sent Grenville, away?—Molton. Who furnished the crew? Molton. What become of the wreck?—ask Molton. It is found drifting, upon the high seas—smoking to the centre—and strewed over with blood and brains. The thought is horrible. He is innocent, no doubt—but will Juliet dare to marry him, where there is such room for calumny? What think you? It were better to die---aye, ten thousand deaths---than live to be the wife of a man---by whose instrumentality, whether evil or good, her husband had perished; a man too, whose own wife is dead by poison, no matter by whose hand administered, just at the critical moment. Molton! Molton! Let me not wrong thee!---I cannot.---There is much that is inexplicable about thee---but thou art innocent. I would wager blood and breath upon it. But should a woman, such a woman, marry thee, though thou be innocent---what would be the inheritance of her children? Hostility and bitterness for one another---shame and horrour, forever and ever.—The blood of Grenville and Molton, would war together to fratricide. J. O.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SAME TO SAME. Philadelphia. I write again. The mail is not yet closed---but we have further intelligence. The pirates are captured; and their story, with all its horrible distinctness, is before me. It is impossible to imagine any conspiracy now--- for the pirates were cut up to an unparalleled degree--their vessel riddled with shot---all their spars disabled, and more than half their crew killed and wounded. No--- there could have been no conspiracy. It is impossible. Beside, it is found, that not one of the four men that Molton furnished Grenville with, is alive; they were made minced meat of. The pirates complain that, but for them, they never should have been exasperated as they were;---nor so disabled, that they could neither fight nor run, when the Ontario hove in sight. I pray God vol. ii. A a that this may be true!---I believe it---for I would not imagine for a moment, that Molton had put a guard upon Grenville---to—. No, I am glad that not one of the four is left alive. That speaks loudly, indeed, of their fidelity. Poor fellows! I knew them well. They had just begun to understand a few words of English; but their strength and appearance were so terrible, that they scarcely ever ventured abroad. Molton knew their temper, and told me himself, that, though they would die for him, at a word---nay, cut each others throats, at his bidding,---yet, that they would whip a knife into the heart of any human being but himself, who happened to thwart them, for a moment, in the publick highway. He was careful to keep them unarmed---and at home---till he let Grenville have them. “The seas are dangerous,” said he.---He then gave his orders to the slaves in their own language. They turned round; prostrated themselves; raised poor Grenville's foot, and placed it upon their heads, one after the other. “But trust to these fellows, whatever may happen. They will understand you.--- Signs are sufficient. Just touch the handle of that dagger---if you want yourself defended, or avenged---and the business is done. You might sleep quietly in hell, with such a guard about you.” Adieu, dear Sarah. I still continue to write you, without knowing where to address my letters---but in the hope that some may find you, at last. Juliet is much the same, I hear, and the babe finely. Once more, Adieu. JOHN OMAR.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">RANDOLPH TO SARAH. Mrs. Grenville is no more.—You have a stout heart, woman; or this blow will crush it—O, Sarah, Sarah!— I have heard such things, seen such things. I know not what to think—I am half distracted—farewell!— If it may be, I shall see you, erelong. I have still one affair upon my hands—one, and then, we may meet again.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">MR. STEWART TO MISS RAMSAY. I hasten to offer you an apology, Miss Ramsay, for the outrage that I offered you. I am sorry for it. Will that satisfy you? I am ashamed of it. Is not that enough for a man to say? My family are grieved, and distressed, and mortified. Will you forgive them? Do not believe that this is voluntary. It is not—it is wrung from me, with tears. Yes, Miss Ramsay, with tears;— but, in a manner; and by one, that I am forbidden to speak of;—nay, I am not even at liberty to tell you, how; not even in justification of myself. I can only say that, I have been twice in the field; received more than one apology; and never made one, before, in my whole life;— and that.—No—I have said enough. I am penitent— you know my situation, character.—Is there any atonement? any? Name it. I cannot do any thing, by halves. I love you.—You do not love me—perhaps it is impossible that you should; but, it may be, nevertheless, when you reflect on your delicate and unprotected situation. Will you accept my hand, heart and fortune? They are yours, whenever you please. A word will be sufficient. Appoint me to any probation; and try my constancy and manhood, as you will. I have nothing more to say. I never wrote so long a letter, in my life. P. R. STEWART.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">JOHN TO SARAH. Juliet is gone—gone, for ever. I began, day before yesterday, to tell you of it—nay, yesterday; but, I could not get on with it! My brain rocks, and reels yet, with the agitation, into which it was thrown. All that I can recollect distinctly, however, is this. You know that I had promised to see her, in the morning. I went, earlier, I believe, than I was expected—I trod on tip-toe, over the carpet, in the hall;—and had entered the room; for the door stood open, without being perceived—Juliet was reaching a folded paper to Molton, who sat by her, speechless, and silent as death; with his hands covering his face—and grasping his temples. “Is that true, Edward?” said she, faintly, laying her hand upon his. He trembled—he turned toward her—relinquished her hand, gently, and answered, in a deep voice. “It is true.” She fell back upon the pillow, and shut her eyes—and the tears trickled, like dew, through her lashes. I attempted to retreat—but, he saw me, and his eyes flashed fire. “Omar, is it you?” He was rising; when Juliet, startled by my name, just moved her head, and uttered some words of reproof. There was a dead silence, of some minutes, while we waited for her to regain composure. “I am glad that you are come;” said she, to me—“I am very feeble—but, I hope that I have life enough left to me, for the purpose. Edward, let us be together, a while....only for a moment....go, Edward.” She reached him her hand—just lifted it; and he put his lips to it, as if she were his own wife, or child. As soon as we were alone, she requested me to draw up the writing table to her bed side; and reach her the letter, which Molton had left on the bed. She read it again; and again the tears flowed. “There is no time to be lost,” said she; “I want you to write a few lines to Sarah; they are confidential. I would do it myself, but I cannot. I shall not recover; I am sure of it; this is the bed of death to me, my friend, and I am not sorry that it is. Circumstances, which I have not the time, nor the heart, to explain, have ruptured every tie, that binds me to the world, except that---(her voice trembled here, and her lip worked; but, it was very soon over---) my babe---I cannot bear that, well---but, God will watch over his innocence!---and oh, Mr. Omar, it is hard for a mother to part with her new born babe; just when the pretty eyes, the dear little mouth, are getting familiar to her lips. But, Heaven's will be done! Are you ready? A little nearer, if you please; for, my voice is very weak. You weep, Mr. Omar. I am sorry for it. It is painful to me, to see the sorrow of any human being; but, to know that it is I, who cause it; that is not well to be borne. There are some thoughts in your heart, that I could remove, if I had the strength; some infirmities of your character, that the advice of a friend, a woman; one whom you have felt a tenderness for, upon her death-bed; nay, nay, these gushes of passion are unmanly. I expected better things, my dear friend; my brother. But, time is precious. Please to follow me--- I do not mean the words---but the thought. Tell Sarah how I am; and, that I cannot live many days. I wanted to see her.--I expected it;---and, had I not known her well, I should have thought it a little unkind in her, to let me die alone. But perhaps she is ill, herself; or”---I was alarmed at the appearance of her eyes; and she added, while the colour shot over her forehead, in streaks, “do you know any thing of a Mr. Randolph?” I told her that I had heard of such a person, recently, I thought; but where, or when, I knew not; nay, that I had some loose notion of having once seen a man of that name. She did not explain herself; but, after a few moments of silence, she added. “Has your brother returned?” Not yet; but, I expect him every hour; said I. “Let me see him, the moment that he arrives. He has a noble heart; and we owe him much. Few people know him. I want to see him. I must. Now, if you please, to Sarah.” She then dictated a letter to you, which she signed, with her own hand. I am not at liberty, I believe, to tell you what it is; for, I have heard nothing of it, since. But she enclosed a large bundle of other letters in it; and, among them, I perceived that, which Molton and she had been reading, as I entered. It was the very one, which Grenville had left for her, to be opened, in case of a certain event. What was that event? His death, I suppose. vol. ii. A a 2 After that was done, she gave me her hand; requested to be told, when my brother arrived; and slept quietly, like an infant, for two or three hours. Our hopes revived—her beautiful eyes were lighted up; and her voice was more cheerful. But, all my terrour returned, as I saw her exchange a look with Molton; when the physician, reproving us sharply for our folly and rashness, told her that we had hazarded her life, but that—he saw much, nevertheless, to encourage him. She turned her eyes to Molton, with a smile, and just moved her head. He understood it—for his lips were, instantly, as pale as ashes. My arteries thrilled with it, too. I felt then, then, for the first time, that there was no hope. Just then, a woman broke furiously into the room, and rushed to the bed. It was like an apparition. I thought her mad—but Molton's arm was quicker than my thought; for, the next moment, she was dashed against the wall, and a knife wrenched from her hand—though she grasped it, like a wild beast, by the blade; and I heard the sinews grit, as he plucked it through the fingers, severing tendon and bone. It was Matilda. She had broken loose from her confinement, about a week before; and, now, gained admittance, by finding the door open, from which she had been repeatedly sent, as an importunate, disordered wretch. Molton carried her away, by main force, amid her curses, screams, and the most horrible blasphemy.— This was too much for Juliet. She fainted—and so long was it, ere she showed any symptom of returning life, that we began to fear it was all over with her. But the sound of Molton's voice, revived the spark, for a moment. She held his hand to her mouth. She wept upon it. Her beautiful hair, disordered and loose, covered the whole pillow. “I shall not live to see your brother,” said she, to me—“but, I pray you, to tell him, that I remember, and bless him, with my dying breath. Mary, take my scissors, dear, and—I must not forget him, now.” “Nay,” said Molton, awaking all at once—“even in death, Juliet, art thou so kind to all? What! leave thy tresses to him! What, then, wilt thou leave to me?” “My heart, Edward.” He bowed upon her hand. “No, love,” said he, “that must never be—the only infirmity of thy nature—that, Juliet, which has cost us all our suffering, is thy too great gentleness to all—thy too little passionate devotion to one. Do not leave thy hair among men. Thy blessing is enough. Even I—I never asked thee for a lock. I would not; for that was what many wanted—and more than one, it may be, obtained. Nay, Juliet—O, pardon me—I cannot bear thy tears.” “Thou art right, very right, Edward,” said she. “I will not leave even the hair of a dead woman, to disturb thee. But one thing I would have thee know. No man ever had—none!—had ever a lock of it, with my consent or approbation, except my husband; and to him, it was given without my knowledge. I am very faint—very, dear Edward. Come nearer—sit down, love, where I can place my head upon thy shoulder. Bear witness, all of you, that I forgive, and bless, and weep for my husband. I have loved him. I might have loved him yet; or, have lived and died in the belief that I did; but it cannot be, now. The heart will find its lord, at last, ere it be utterly dead. Behold mine! The laws of society are no longer for me. Yet a little while, and I shall be kneeling, in the presence of our indulgent and compassionate Father—of one, who will not charge me with sin; nor punish me with sorrow or banishment, for telling the truth upon my death-bed. It is my death-bed. I believe it. And, therefore, do I tell Edward, as I do, with the voice of a dying woman, that my heart has always been faithful to him; even while I was most faithful to my poor husband; and even while I believed that he was a bad man:---but, that you may all understand the truth, and remember it, at this eventful moment, I would tell you, further, that, if I should recover---it is impossible--- I feel that within me, which makes death certain---his could hand is not to be misunderstood---it is real, now--- I feel it approaching my heart, while I speak---but, even if I should recover, we should never be married. Both of us have reasons for it---have we not, Edward?” He bowed, and covered his face. “But I would never set so bad an example to women; to mothers; or to wives,” she continued. “The hour is nearer, Edward---very near, now.— Where is my babe.” The child was brought to her. She desired to be raised. She bowed her head upon its little face; and, it would seem, that the child knew its mother, and would not part with her, again---for its little fingers were so tangled in her glittering hair, that they were fain to cut it away, to release her. “Baptized in tears, my babe!” said she, faintly---“in tears, sweet. Let his name be thine, Edward. And now, farewell---a mother's blessing upon thee, thou great heart! Take my babe, Edward---be a father to it!” Molton fell upon his knees; and, for the first time, the tears rolled out of his eyes, quietly, as from any fountain, without that convulsion and labouring of the heart, which was so frightful before. Her eyes were lifted---a sweet smile played upon her mouth as she saw it---the melody of her voice died away ---she laid one hand upon the dear babe that lay sprawling in her lap---another upon Molton's---as his face was buried in its swaddling clothes—he caught it—and the last words that she uttered, were—“I do not leave a lock of hair to the man that I love; but, I leave to thee, my heart and soul, Edward---my babe!” Molton actually sobbed—and there was no voice heard, but the voice of lamentation and wailing, till the bed shook—and Molton fell backward upon the floor. The dying Juliet saw it—turned her gentle eyes to heaven—locked her hands upon her bosom, meekly, fervently—and died. So quietly had her sweet spirit abandoned its chamber, that, from her countenance, her parted lips, her half-shut eyes, we were yet waiting for her last prayer, when her hands parted, and fell. Molton saw this. He stood upon his feet---he tore open his bosom---he threw himself upon the bed---he held her cheek to his heart---her hands... “God bless me! Art thou really dead; really, love? How cold thy hand is!” He shuddered. “Take it away! away!---I cannot move it!---my veins are ice!---it has frozen to my heart!---cold! cold! very cold! Juliet!---ah!--- no more sprouting, no more flowering, no more greenness here!---no more summer-time, Juliet!---ashes!—ashes!” A long insensibility followed. But he is calm, now; terribly calm;---as if the worst had now happened, that could happen, to a desolate man. Poor Juliet!---her funeral will be to-morrow. Farewell. JOHN OMAR. P. S.---I have just heard that Molton, and the child, and the nurse, have all disappeared. Will he be at the funeral? I tremble for him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">RANDOLPH TO SARAH. It is all over, dear Sarah. Thy friend is at rest. The funeral just went by my window. I shall try to see thee, soon, now. A strange event has happened to me; and we can, at least, be friends---whatever may happen hereafter. My marriage, I have good reason to believe, is illegal. I mention this that there may be no future disquietude at thy heart, if I should approach thee as a friend. Is it true, that the gentleman of whom you lately spoke, (Mr. Stewart,) is an old admirer of yours. If it be, I would have you very cautious. Trust to me. I can do that, which none but a brother could do for you, Sarah. I could, and will, hunt up the whole history of his life. I have made some inquiries; and the result is exceedingly satisfactory. Trust to me, Sarah—believe me. My only wish, now, is to make one human being happy. Let me speak, plainly. I love thee, Sarah; have loved thee, when it was a sin, and a shame. I have abused thy great nature. And I would offer such an atonement, as such a woman might worthily accept. But I cannot offer thee, myself. For many reasons, that were not a worthy offering. I love thee, and shall always love thee; and, though I be set free from my unfortunate marriage, I have yet, at my heart, another, and an unconquerable reason, for not obtruding myself upon thy love, as a husband. Thy friend, I shall be, through life and death, dear; for reasons, too, that will soon be all before thee. Thou wilt not wonder, then. Now, what shall I do for thee? Here is a man that does love thee—young, handsome, rich, and wise. Can I promote thy happiness?— Believe me—it is thy happiness alone, Sarah, that I think of. My own might have been dear to me; but that time is passed. And were I young; unincumbered; unwedded; with a heart as innocent as thine own, Sarah, I would say to thee, as I say now. Thou art free, love— free, as the winds of heaven! Go where thou wilt, with whom thou wilt; but, when thou art weary of all the world; turn thou to me, and thou wilt find consolation. Nay, Sarah, though the hour had come—though we stood up to receive the nuptial benediction, together—did I see a man, that I thought better able to make thee happy— nay, one that so appeared to thee—I would, with my own right hand—upon the spot—not without one tear—one spasm, it may be, of the heart—give thee away, love—and travel, the remainder of my pilgrimage, alone. One only thought might disquiet me. Sarah might have been deceived. I might have been. He who supplanted me, though he might have had virtues that I had not; though he were handsomer, better tempered, kinder, than I— and—no, I will not imagine that—no man could ever love, as I have loved the woman of my heart—it would be possible that he would not be so indulgent, so devoted, or so truly her husband, as I would have been. This would break my heart. If I could do that, then, Sarah, judge what I could do for thee, now. Thou art desolate and alone. Permit me to lead a man to thee, who will love and cherish thee, for ever and ever; one, whom the sick chamber shall not weary—whose affection and tenderness will augment with all that renders them endearing. Marry him, and I shall be happy. One tear, one farewell, Sarah; and Randolph will never darken thy path, again. He might watch over thee, and thine; nay, he would, but thou wouldst never know it. It would be a secret and invisible guardianship. May I hope this?— Farewell. You are better. The single line that I received, assures me of it. Never were words more precious to me. I hope soon to see you—very soon. RANDOLPH.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">EDWARD MOLTON TO SARAH RAMSAY. By the command of a woman, who loved Miss Ramsay; and spoke of her, with deep affection, upon her death-bed, as a good, and great, but mistaken woman, I have been intluced to address her. Mrs. Grenville, within one hour of her dissolution, extorted from me a promise to put into your hands, the enclosed paper. It contains some of her hair; a picture, I believe; and some letters. What they are, I do not know; but, from the solicitude that she manifested on the subject, I am led to believe, that they were very dear to her, or to you. For that reason, I have kept them a whole week, in the hope of finding a private conveyance; and, were it not for one circumstance, I would keep them, until I could deliver them into your own hands. But, her command is peremptory; and I cannot disguise that I have some unwillingness to obtrude myself upon a woman, to whom my very name is hateful. Mrs. Grenville has described your character to me; so that I am persuaded, that it is better for us not to meet, until your prejudices are somewhat softened. I respect you, Miss Ramsay; and I would do much to convince you of it; but I respect myself, too much, to enter into a defence of my conduct, even at the request of Juliet herself, before any human being that knew her sentiments for me; and yet believed me to be a villain. Your knowledge of her character, Miss Ramsay, should have taught you some indulgence; some charity, for mine. We might have met. If we had, I do not doubt but you would have suffered, for your precipitation and rashness. But why address you in this manner. You have cruelly and continually wronged a man, whom you knew not; whom you had never seen, merely because, like every other man's, his conduct was capable of a wicked interpretation. I forgive you, nevertheless; and if we should ever meet upon this earth, or another, I shall be the first to repeat, again and again, that—I forgive you. EDWARD MOLTON. P. S.---Remember---I do this only at the request of Juliet. She knows me; and my whole life. Letters enclosed---No. 1. Envelope—in the hand writing of J. Omar; and signed by Juliet. Nos. 2. 3. and 4.---in order, as they appear. No. I.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">JULIET TO SARAH, IN THE HAND WRITING OF MR. OMAR. A few hours more, at furthest, dear Sarah; and I shall be beyond the reach of sorrow or temptation. I have been a good deal disturbed, and terrified at the thought; but, more recent meditation; and two or three strange events, which these letters will explain, have prepared me to meet death with cheerfulness. I have no hope left in life; not one. At first, there was an agony, but it was soon over, for the loss of my husband. It was that, which first penetrated my heart---but his own letters, will show to thee, that, I have reason for consolation.--- Then came the thought of my babe, Sarah---for I am now a mother---a mother, for a few hours only---and, the—O, I cannot describe the bitterness of that thought;—but there was a consolation even for that. My mind is now tranquil, comparatively, I mean; and more truly resigned, I am sure, to the bereavement of my life, than it was in my terrible sickness, summer before last:---one only thing remained to trouble me. It was that Sarah was not near me. Had she been---and, had I been blessed with a daughter, instead of a son, Sarah should have been her mother. As it is, I can only pray, that, during the peril of his infancy, she will be near my babe, and bless it. Canst thou do this, Sarah?---Canst thou, when all is known? Thou mayest have to share the sweet guardianship, with one,---I will not name him---thy mortal hatred for him, that unnatural scorn and bitterness with which thou hast pursued that man, Sarah, is upon my breast at this moment, like a malediction. What had he done to thee, Sarah? What hadst thou known of him, which was not capable of a charitable interpretation. I urged him to see thee---to deliver these letters to thee:—he knows not what they are---and it is well that he does not---to tell thee, in his deliberate, firm way, the simple truth of our history, and love----nay, of all that concerned me. He would have evaded my prayer ---he would have put it off; but, I pressed it upon him, until he consented, if you ever met, to vindicate himself, as he would another;---with this reservation alone, insisted upon, by himself, that, in defending himself, he should not be called upon to produce any proofs; or to impeach, in any way, the character of any other person.— This is his nature, Sarah; he will be believed, on his bare word, or not at all; and he will sooner perish, in the hatred and scorn of all the world; than protect himself by the destruction of others; of them that he loves, I mean; for, had he the power, he would lay the world in ashes,---even now,---I know that he would have done it, once;---if them, that he did not love, should step with their shadow between him, and his ambition.--- Helen, his wife, my husband, and myself seem to be all concerned, in the engagement. It is for the purpose of counteracting the effect, which I anticipate from this proud, high spirit in him; and bringing my dear Sarah, to a sense of her injustice, that I have collected, and preserved these letters; and that I now bequeath them to her, as my dearest deposite. Read them; and do him justice---as speedily, I would say, as possible; for the quiet of thine own spirit; for, it may be, that he, himself, hath not long to live:---it may be, that, ere that atonement shall be offered, he will have joined the three beings, whose very ashes he would keep from dishononr, vol. ii. Bb and irreverence, at the peril of his own reputation. Two of them; nay, three, are already where such sentiments can have little weight or influence with them;---yet a little while, and a fourth, nay, Sarah---for I have had a death-bed vision---and my soul wept and prayed to avert it; but it might not be—a fifth went by me, in her shroud —I knew her—and I put out my hands, with a shriek, to welcome her; but she smiled, and faded away, while the moonlight was shining through her. Farewell, dear Sarah, farewell, forever. Forever!—O, no, not forever, dear. A little while, and we shall be weeping upon each others bosoms—we, and all that we love—remembering this separation, as a momentary check of the pulse only—which alarmed us—but, compared with what time we shall then have spent together, it will be only for a breath. Why should we weep then?—Farewell! Heaven bless thee, dear, dear Sarah, forever and ever Watch thyself continually. Watch and pray! JULIET. P. S.—Enclosed is a handful of my hair—I would have thee wear it. And the picture of one, whom I would have dear to thee:—and strange as it may seem, I may be sure, if you should ever meet, that he will be so. I do not tell thee, his name; but I have taken some pains to procure it, and I am sure that—no I am too faint to proceed—farewell!—It was painted many years ago. J.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">HELEN TO JULIET. ENCLOSED. No. II. Your husband is dead, madam—torn to pieces, by wild beasts. I am glad of it. He deserved it. I could tell you a tale of him, that would make you hate his memory, like death; plausible as he was—kind as he was; but I have not the proof within my reach—and, though I know that the conspiracy existed, yet I have not the heart, utterly to destroy a woman, whose lord hath played so falsely with her. All that I would do, is this—arouse her to a sense of her own excellence. What!—a creature that Edward Molton hath loved, to idolatry,—hath loved, night and day; dreamed of, even in my arms—O, it was hard to bear, Juliet—another would have wept and cursed thee—but I—I could not—there was something consecrate about thee;—and when, in his troubled, cold sleep —he would murmur thy name; call me Juliet, while his lips grew to mine—O, there was that horrible pleasure, and delirium in it, that I could not wake him.—did not, till one night—in a trance,—No, no—wait awhile. I must tell thee that story more regularly; or, it may be, that it will not be believed. Before you have finished this letter, I shall be dead. Remember that. And when you find it true, believe me: —not till then, I do not ask it till then. This hand, Juliet—O, how I should have loved thee, woman, wast thou my sister; yea, anybody, anybody of all this earth, except the first love of Edward—that I cannot forgive— will not—and yet, I cannot hate thee—for, I have wronged thee. Who married thee?—who drove thee with a thong of serpents into the toil?—was it Jane?—ay. But who spirited Jane up to the work?—who furnished her with facts that maddened thee;--facts, that Molton had told me in his sleep. It was I!—I, alone! But for that, thy indignation at his baseness and treachery—it was that which drove thee into Grenville's arms. I knew it. I knew then. The artifices of Jane were paltry.— She was an ordinary woman. They would have failed, but for me—even they—and thou hadst never been the husband of Grenville. But she was rewarded. The fool—and that other woman of darkness, that Matilda —the Lord, God Omnipotent, hath been upon them both. The one is mad—and the other destroyed herself. How? —let her be careful, if she come to life again, how she send her letters of guilt unsealed. She was a murderess. I knew it. I kept the secret, like a charged thunderbolt, to launch at her brain, whenever I was weary of her. The hand of him, that she loved, sent it.—It went. She became, on the spot, a heap of blood and ashes. And Grenville too, I could have slain him—he was in my power; but I forbore, lest the mighty reward of all my labour; thy separation, for ever and ever, from Edward, should be nought. Yet—he was weak—and he had rifled,—visited—that were enough to deserve his fate—a heart, where the image of Molton was concealed. The pirates were upon him;—and his bones were splintered; and his flesh hacked, till—even I wept to hear of it. Then came the thought of retribution. I knelt down. I prayed not to be mad, for a little while. I owed some terrible atonement, for all that I had made him suffer— Molton, I mean—ah!—if I do not hurry, I shall never live to finish the tale. I owed him some reward for his love and constancy. Your husband was out of the way.—Let his wife follow, and he would be rewarded, I thought. Should I let out my heart's blood at his feet? —No!—for though I was determined to die;—and let them that would, roll my corpse away, from the road to thy bed, Juliet—yet, it was unsightly to die in blood; and Jane too,--she was an ordinary woman---she died so. True, it was a fit of passion in her—but I scorn that— what I have done, evil or good, has been deliberately done. I wanted to talk with Molton too, after I should feel my heart on fire; when it was too late for the aid of man to help me.—I could not do this, if I slew myself, as she did;—and then he might suspect my purpose, if I reasoned of it; and withhold me. Should it be poison?—My hand was somewhat familiar with that. I had given it to him once. So---I took poison. It is at work now---I feel it---here, here!---the tissue tightens about my heart; and my breathing, scorches my own lips. But let me tell thee, how that was It was in her arms-- our cheeks touched, and thrilled---I was sleeping upon his shoulder; and, as I loved to sleep, even in that haunted room---with my eyes just open---and a voluptuous, rich drowsiness, all about me. He whispered; and put his hand upon my forehead.---I turned, trembling, toward him, and our arms were interlaced,---just then--- aye, just then--hell and furies!--he whispered thy name-- it was not Helen, that he uttered---no, no!---it was Juliet. The curtain shivered, and swam before my eyes---I dashed away his hands---and I knew not what followed---but I had a dream---and when I awoke, he was there, standing over me.---It was broad day light---I looked at my hands, expecting to find thy blood, or his, upon them---for such was my dream.---I thought that I had left my bed, and entered thine; and left thee, with the blood gushing out of thy side—nay, Juliet---hast thou forgotten the alarm, when somebody came to thy window at night. That was I!---Two miles had I wandered, with the instinct of a blood hound to his prey---but I was baffled. How, I know not---I heard voices---and a shot was fired. All this past through my mind; but my hands were clean---no blood upon them. I looked at them. I felt strangely bewildered; and yet---there was a burning distinctness in one apparition, that I had seen. It stood upon the blue water---and its eyes were like the stars in winter, all the brighter for their coldness---I approached---meaning to strangle it---but the water shivered, and broke, and sparkled, like glass in the star light, wherever I set my foot.---It was thee!---I was awake now,---I remembered a goblet.---I turned to where I had seen it in my delirium. There it was---there---with the blood-red sediment at the bottom, yet---the infernal drug. I was broad awake, in an instant---I caught Edward's hand---I wrung it---O, my God!---my God! it would not vanish.---I caught at it, I dashed into dust. He was terrified---and I---I dared not ask him, what he knew of the goblet. A whole hour passed; and then, I sat me down calmly; took his two hands into mine, and asked him, steadily, what had been in it. “I know not, love,” said he. “It is the cup that thy hand offered me this morning, as I awoke early, and found thee, thy hair wet and dripping---and thy limbs all trembling, “Did you,—did you swallow it?” said I, gasping for breath. “I did?”---was the reply—and he put his lips upon my eye lids. “It was death, Edward,” said I. He did not appear to heed me.---But I proceeded---I told him all---where the poison had been hid; why I had prepared it---and that there was no hope for him. He took my hand---his countenance darkened; and, for a moment, he looked as he were about to crush me vol. ii. B b 2 under his feet---the next, it was a terrible struggle,—he fell upon my bosom,—“Mistaken woman,” he cried, “what could possess thee! Thou hast drugged with death, the truest heart—that—” O, I know not what prevented me, from dashing my brains out, upon the spot. To be so met; so rewarded; for a deed like mine, when I had only prepared myself to be scattered by a whirlwind---for I knew him---and I knew that nothing mortal could withstand him, in his wrath---when I expected him to tear off the poisoned reptile that enfolded him, and tread it to death;-- O, God,---to be caressed, more warmly, more tenderly, than ever! I fell at his feet---but just then, a thought---O, it was devilish---shot over my brain. “By what name,” said I, “did I adjure thee to drink it?”---I began to have a faint, yet burning recollection of the whole. He looked me steadily in the face.---“By a name, proud woman---that, mad as thou act, (O, Juliet; he knew not how true were his words, at that moment!--- I was mad;---I had been---) by a name,” said he, “at the sound of which, even in my grave, I would arise, and exhaust; drain, to the very dregs---the chalice of hell, itself. By the name of Juliet.” I started at the sound—the blood frothed in my arteries.---I burst from his arms---my heart felt suddenly distended, as if a torrent had discharged itself, all at once, into it. It was many days, before I recovered. But Edward was alive---and only alive. The operation of the poison, was slow, but never the less fatal. It hath burnt within him, from that hour to this---and will, to his dying day. It was the knowledge of this, that withheld him from thee, Juliet. He loved thee, to death and distraction. He never loved me, never!---It was pity only, and compassion, that led him, in a moment, of romantick delirium, to marry me. Bid him tell thee, the tale. From that hour, he never knew one of tranquillity. He wept of thee---talked of thee, continually; of thy innocence and helplessness;---but never, when awake;---and never had I permitted him to know that I was informed of it. He was silent on the subject; and so was I; he, from tenderness; and I, from wounded pride. What could he do? He could have set himself free, at any hour he pleased, from me; for our marriage was illegal:---but he would not, for he knew that my life was bound up in his love. The temptation was terrible. He had only to speak the word---a single word; and my husband,---my first husband, stood ready to take me to his bosom; nay, a single word would have sent me, back, alone, over the wide Atlantick. He loved thee, yet,—might not that love tempt him to wander?---Could it be expected, that he would always remain so devoted to me, while he so loved another,—merely, because it was my happiness; my only happiness, in a land of strangers. But the poison wrought. Then was it, then! for the first time, that I felt sure of him! I knew his nature too well;---I knew that, were I dead at his feet, he would never marry thee; never tell his love,---while that death was eating into his vitals. I was right. He avoided thee. He told thee of his marriage. It was false. We were married, it is true---but illegally. I was the wife of another man, at the same moment; and a lunatick!---He could have separated me, from him, for ever, at a word. Do you shudder? It is true, so help me, God! I did not know it, myself. It was long, and long after, that I learnt it; and then, I dared not tell the truth. He had married me, because he saw my flesh lacerated, my lips torn, and my wrists stained with the iron that bound me. I knew not the reason; and I told the tale as it appeared to me. Gracious heaven! will it be believed, that my father had concealed the tremendous disorder from my first husband; and that I, a lunatick, was married, in the holy church, to a man that loved me!---O, I cannot tell thee, how fervently. It was our hereditary disorder; but my father was ambitious. I had discovered this---might not Molton? And, if he did, would he not avail himself of it, to part with me, forever—and fly to thee? The thought haunted me, night and day, before the poison had been given. At last, a plot was matured. Jane and Matilda, and I, prepared the infernal ingredients—and thy husband stood by, holding thy hand over them—while a priest muttered his incantation. Juliet, there were faces, other than of this earth, seen in the smoke of the church, that morning!— And there were living creatures near thee, as the benediction was pronounced; and when that faint sickness of the heart, came over thee. I was there—even I. Then, I was secure. But where, when can the guilty say this. Cold sweats were upon me, night and day. Edward waxed thinner and thinner, every hour; and, every hour, I felt as if my heart had been thrown into a coil of tangled serpents—hungry—and I could fancy that the blood dripped from their jaws, continually, like fire, upon the wound. Many times, I was ready to throw myself at the feet of Edward; and confess the whole. O, I knew not that he was already master of it; and that he forgave me---the cruellest thing of all!—only from discovering, by an interview with Mr. Grenville, that, weak as he had been in this affair; nay, wicked as he had been, he was naturally a good man, and well fitted to make thee happy.— I know that he meditated terrible things—I know it; for he sat up all one night; and his face was tremendously stern and pale. That was the crisis. He forgave me— it was after he had seen your husband. But your husband died. I am revengeful, but I am generous. My mother was a Spanish woman. I inherited her hot blood. But my father was an Englishman, an honour to his country. I inherited his lordly nature. It was time for me, now, to do my part. I thought of it, long and long, before the news of your husband's death, came to me. But that determined me—that!---I took the remainder of that very poison, which I had given to Edward, three years before. That done, I sent for him, and told him all. He was frightfully agitated, at first; but, in a little while—accursed thought—it appeared to me, that he was thinking, already, of his reward. I could read Juliet, in his very eyes. But, witnesses were near; and I told him, in vengeance, as much as in honesty, that he had been the husband of a mad woman. He affected not to believe me. But, the blow went home---home! I felt his heart stagger—and heard the blood rush out of it, as I whispered the truth in his ear. Pity me, Juliet; pity me. I was born for something better than I am. Pity me! But I had written this—all but the few last lines.--- Them, I have now added, while he and your cousin, are now whispering in the next room; and my girl is at the door. All is now over—they are returning—one moment, Juliet! I could have loved thee, dear; nay, I do love thee, even at this moment. Farewell!—farewell!— Remember, that my guilt is one of madness, and of love. Canst thou understand it? Thou canst! O, how he used to talk of thee in his sleep—it was hard to bear, Juliet—but—but—I forgive thee—and bless thee! HELEN.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">GRENVILLE TO HIS WIFE. No. III—Enclosed. This will be given to you, my dear Juliet, only in the event of my death; an event, which, I am sure, is much nearer than either has been dreaming of. Read it, therefore, as the last confession of a dying man; a husband, too, to his wife; the father, it may be, of a babe already born to thee;—and, if thou canst, dear, forgive him. To obtain thee, Juliet, I permitted a system of cruelty and perfidy to continue, long and long after I came to the knowledge of it. For this, my love, my reverence, my passionate tenderness for thee, are no excuse. But, I had not the heart to break up a conspiracy; and betray the plotters of thy ruin into thy hands, while I saw so much probable advantage to myself, in permitting it to continue. Nor is this all, Juliet. I participated, not only by my silence; but, actually, with my countenance and behaviour. For this I do repent me, bitterly, in dust and ashes. This it is, Juliet, that has troubled my sleep, even at thy side;—this, that has fevered and parched my lips, and sunk my temples; dimmed my eyes; and turned my black hair gray, within one little year. What has it not cost me to conceal my own villany! Much that thou believest real, of the perfidy, cruelty and baseness of Molton, is false;—more of it is so discoloured and distorted, that it is no longer the same; and many times, dear, when thy tears have fallen upon my arm; and thy bosom hath heaved, unsteadily, all the live long night, when both were pretending to be asleep, have I heard or fancied, that the movement of thy sweet lips, had the sound of Molton in it—and then, I have been, more than once, on the point of throwing myself upon my knees, and avowing it all—just as I did to him, immediately after our marriage. From that hour, the secret hath been in his keeping. While I lived, it would have remained there, unless in some moment of confidence, when thou wast sleeping, to thy thought, in the bosom of an honourable man—my heart had burst with it—and let it out, together with its blood, upon the spot. How I have borne it, God only knows:—to feel thy caresses; thy tears; thy affectionate touch; and see thy gentle eyes lighting up at my approach; and to know that I was unworthy of thee—O, it has, many and many a time, driven me to treat thee capriciously—as if I had no heart for such luxury:—to rebuke thee, by my coldness; and even to hurry away from what—was death to me— caresses, that I felt, were meant to be lavished, upon what I was not—an honest man. It may be, dearest Juliet, my wife! my beloved! that, in time I should have had the courage to tell thee all;— and it may be, that thou would'st have loved me still.— The father of thy children; thy companion for many years; a penitent—I could not have been utterly contemptible in thy eyes. But—. But heaven hath ordered it wisely. I am at death's door. One step—and I enter. And when I am gone, Molton, that inexplicable man, whose worst fault is a bold, hazardous frankness; and disdain of prejudice, he will bear this to thee. Nay—he will put it into thy hands to remain, when we part; with permission to open it, in case of my death—and under no other condition. My last advice—dearest of women—is this:—forget me—forgive me—and give thyself up, when it may be, if heaven, shall so order it, to him who hath so long, and so devotedly, loved thee. The event is distant; impossible perhaps; but I cannot help dreaming of it, as one that must happen, eventually, for the reward of such sublime affection, as that of your two hearts hath been. Farewell! Juliet---Farewell! The property that I leave to thee, is altogether thine. The proper steps have already been taken to secure to thee, an honourable independence. If the babe should live—there is only one man to whom I would entrust its education, if it be a boy —thy heart will tell thee who that is. I have heard him reason much upon the subject; and I know that he has thought much upon it. If a girl—to thee, Juliet; and to thee alone, do I commit her. Heaven bless thee, my wife; my dear one! Farewell! GRENVILLE. P. S. I have read it over again. It does'nt express a single thought, of the hundred that agitate me. I have no talent for writing, nor for conversation;—but I can feel, Juliet; I can feel that I have been a scoundrel; that I have cheated thee; conspired against thee; and wronged an honest man, beyond the reach of reparation. Let me do him the last justice in my power. The fact which I communicated to thee, the very evening before our marriage—that, which so shook and terrified thee— was never told by him. I made thee believe then, that it was. That was worse than lying. It was full as base—and more dastardly. I know not how it was betrayed; and Molton stood like one thunderstruck, when I mentioned it. “By my hopes of salvation,” he said, “I never breathed that secret, into the ears of mortal man—nor woman, nor child. I never committed it to paper—and I know not, by what supernatural intelligence, it can ever have been known. She must have told it herself! But no— that were impossible!” Enough, Juliet—I can say no more. How these things were known; I cannot imagine; Molton, himself, cannot imagine; but, I would risk my life; or the little that remains of it, while I am writing this, that Molton never spoke of thee, in his life, but with the most devout tenderness. Judge then, if he could ever have ridiculed thy gentleness; profaned the secret of thy heart; told when and where you had met; and how you had—no, it is impossible! Farewell—Farewell!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SARAH TO RANDOLPH. The man, Molton, has had the presumption to write to me; and that too, proudly; as if I were a woman, to be wrought upon, like the infatuated Juliet. I shall reply to him, merely for the purpose of advancing my suit with him. It was more than two weeks ago; and, weak as I am, I cannot delay it longer. O, Randolph, had you known that woman! so gentle, so uniform, so gifted! with such lofty and heroick principle; and yet, so blinded, and carried away, by the fascination, of that man.— I have received some letters—some, that, were it any man but Edward Molton, whom they concern, would almost tempt me to believe him innocent. But, how can I? Come to me, Randolph. I cannot answer your last letter—I shall not. The storm has changed my nature. I feel a growing sullenness, and darkness, and collectedness, that I never had before. My own transgressions wane, before those of the most perfectly virtuous woman, that I ever knew. I look in upon my own heart, and I wonder at it. The plague spots, there, are fiery and sanguine; but, even her heart is not sound. What, Juliet! —dear Juliet—look down upon me! let thy tears fall upon them!—Even thy heart was not utterly pure! Death weakened it. Thou didst take counsel of thy weakness, and thy womanhood; and admit a man to thy husband's sanctuary—and such a man!—Enough!—My errand is now, of another nature. I would have you find out Molton, if he be on the face of this earth; and give him this letter; and pray him; entreat of him, to yield up the babe to me. I will be a mother to it. It shall bear his name. I will even consent to that. Nay, I will permit him to see it, when he pleases—to share, if he will, in the expenses of its education—and, when old enough, if it must be, I will relinquish its guardianship, entirely to him. Bring me the boy, Randolph—never leave him, till he consents—never see me, without him.--- I care not, at what sacrifice. Juliet shall find, that there is one, upon the earth, that truly loved her.—Let me see you, too, as soon as possible. Nay, there are.—But, no matter. This commission executed, I have then, another for you. Take the babe and nurse, into your own hands. I have been too long asleep—I begin to awake. I have duties to perform; and I am determined to perform them. SARAH RAMSAY.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SARAH RAMSAY TO EDWARD MOLTON. The tone of your letter, sir, would deserve reproof; but, sorrow and humiliation have taken down the pride of my heart; and taught me to hope, where I cannot believe in the honour and uprightness of another. I have little to say to you; but you have, at least, one virtue; and to that, alone, I address myself. You are frank, and direct; heaven knows for what purpose; but such, I believe, is the fact. Let me be so, too. I do not think well of you. I never shall. Nothing that can ever happen, during the lapse of many years, can change my opinion of you. You loved my friend, Juliet. I cannot understand how—but, the fact appears to be certain. I loved her, too. She has entrusted you with her babe. I am legitimately entitled to it. It was blindness and delusion in her, alone, that led her to confide a charge, so precious, to one; of whom, she, poor innocent, knew so little that was unequivocally good. You may be an injured man, sir. I would fain believe that you are. But, until that vol. ii. C c appears; and I cannot see how it should appear, until all hearts are laid open for judgment, before God, I cannot consent to hold any correspondence with you. You see that I am very plain. I would save trouble. I would have this letter effectual; and the last, that I shall ever have occasion to address you. I wrote to you, once before. Have you forgotten it? My opinion is unaltered; and, though you may be an innocent and abused man; yet, it is certain, that you have an evil reputation. That alone, should disqualify you for the important, the sacred charge of education. Would you taint the babe, from its very birth? Mr. Molton, I address you as a man— good or bad, I care not, at this moment; but, as a man—I ask you, if you would not yield up that child, if you were visited by pestilence, or contagion?—It might not be your fault—it would be merely your misfortune; but, would you breathe into that child the poison?— Your reputation would be as fatal to the—will you give up the child?—You will. I am rejoiced, for once, to believe well of you. You will! I am very humble—very;—but, the occasion demands it. Else, I could not sue to one, that, to this moment, I feel a strange, deep antipathy toward. I use no disguise. The conditions, you will name. Let them be as easy as you can. But, whatever they are, they will be religiously observed by me. The gentleman, who hands you this, is named Randolph. He is a particular, and dear friend of mine. You will be perfectly safe, in making any arrangement with him, respecting the maintenance of the nurse and babe; but, if you will, I should be particularly gratified, if you would leave the matter entirely to me. Sincerely praying for your reformation, I remain, Sir, &amp;c. SARAH RAMSAY.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">RANDOLPH TO SARAH. I have obtained the child. It is now in my house, together with its nurse. The enclosed note is directed to you: and, I have just received some remarks upon the education of children; which, at some future day, are to be submitted to you. He thinks of leaving the country: and if so, these regulations, if there be any good in them, may be of value. He is in very bad health: and, has the appearance of one, kept alive, and in motion, by a continual effort. If he rest, for a moment, he becomes immovable. A settled melancholy is upon him; and, he appears sufficiently conscious of his danger, to make considerable exertion, for the re-establishment of his health;—and yet, as if it were a matter of duty, rather to others, than to himself; for, there is a cold, continual, phlegmatick indifference about him, in every movement. He read your letter—was silent, for some moments; and then wrote, with a pencil, the following billet; adding, at the same time, that the child and nurse should be ready for me, in two hours, if they were well. In two hours, precisely, a carriage stopped at my door; and they appeared. To-morrow, or next day, I shall set out for New York, when I hope to show you the loveliest little creature, that you ever set your eyes upon. SPENCER RANDOLPH.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">(NOTE ENCLOSED.) I love frankness. I make no conditions. The child is yours. Had you flattered me, you would not have prevailed. As it is, you had well nigh lost, by one sentence, that resembled flattery. ED: MOLTON. To Miss Ramsay—New York.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">FRANK TO JOHN. Baltimore.— How are you?—my dear brother, how are you? Surely you have expected me; and, as this was about as likely a port, as any, to bring me up, I had a right, I think, to look for a letter from you. Yet I find none. I am in rather extravagant spirits, I confess. The idea of seeing you, and Sarah, and Juliet—Stay, the servant appears at the door—he tells me, that, if I wish to send my letter by to-day's mail, I have not a moment to lose. So farewell, awhile. To-morrow, I shall write to you, again; and, perhaps, the next day, follow my letter, in person. I have a good deal to do for Sarah, here. FRANK. P. S.—Remember me to Mrs. Grenville, with all my heart and soul. She did not go to meet her husband, after all, then?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SAME TO SAME. I wrote to you, yesterday. I shall be detained, I fear, for a whole week. The thought is painful to me; and I have half a mind, to jump into the stage at once; gallop on to you, and shake hands all round; and—then come back again, with my teeth chattering. But I cannot— this business must be done now, or never. I can give you some idea of it; but you will keep it close from every body, and particularly from Sarah—nay, you may as well tell it to Juliet—Mrs. Grenville, I mean—it may make her happier, a few hours in advance of the rest; and who could forbear such a temptation?—that—that— faith, I hardly know where I am; but the amount of it is, that Sarah is a fortune. after all. But what is to become of her? Will she do for you, John? What a pity that so much wealth, and spirit, and beauty, (she may happen to see this letter, you know, John, one day or other,) should go out of the family. I can't bear to think of it; particularly, after all the trouble that I have had; as all the four winds of heaven can testify. You see that my old nature has returned to me. How could it be otherwise, John? Nature will not be changed; and, though she may get, now and then, confoundedly frightened; and become serious and good, in consequence, yet she will laugh, at last; and sin anew, after the cloud hath gone over. By the way, that reminds me of Molton. Where is he now? What is he? I shall ask you a good many questions, now, though you will have no opportunity to answer them; and I know that—merely to kill time—just as people laugh out, when they are just ready to cry—or whistle, for want of thought—or sing when they are frightened—or—But let us return to Molton. I heard a pleasant thing of him the other day. He has made poetry, I am told; and he affects to resemble Byron. Yes, it is very true!---and he really has the vanity to imagine, that he has a Greek face!--- Can you imagine anything more ridiculous? He had been confoundedly frightened by a sudden illness. A lady that I know, was speaking to him of it. “Yes,” said he, “I began to think of a reformation---and, had the fit continued, there is no knowing how good I might have been.” “That would have destroyed your resemblance to Byron,” said she. Was'nt it severe, brother?—home, home, was'nt it? But he never suspected the sarcasm. He took it for a compliment, and bowed. What a fool! Yet he has a strange influence over me. At the very sound of his name, my veins beat and swell; and I feel a sense of suffocation and tightness about the heart, quite distressing to a heretick. O, you have heard of the Delphian Club. I was there, last night—it was a sort of gala with them; and never was it my misfortune, to see such a heap of intellectual rubbish and glitter, in all my life. There were ten or a dozen of them; and the chief entertainment of the society—nay, their chief wit, appeared to consist in calling each other by hard names. I can remember some of them, I believe; for I whipped out my memorandum book, and wrote a few of them down, slily—but they are vol. ii. C c 2 partly defaced now. There was a Mr. Opechanganough Oligostikiss; Precipitate Parquin; Bocgin Jokcullus; Hebti Glott; Pertinax Foncrambogroff, the president, and—O, it is impossible—I cannot make out their names; but I can give you some notion of their characters, and the spirituality of their entertainment. There are about a dozen of them, though their number is limited to nine. They call themselves the he-muses. And each one has a companion allotted him, from among the nine she-ones. Each man has a “clubicular” name, as they call it. The members read essays; chase puns, through fire and smoke, so long as they can perceive a scintilla juris; wrangle vehemently, and noisily, about nothing; talk all together; and eat, when they do eat, which, I should judge, could not be oftener than once a week, with inconceivable effect; and drink after the same manner. First, there was an essay read, by one of the members; a very substantial, good thing; over which, the best natured gentleman that ever I clapped eyes on, went fairly to sleep, with the happiest countenance in the world. I set him down for a stupid fellow, at once; but I was bitterly mistaken. He was really witty and prompt; he did'nt say much—and, what he did say, was in epigram; one, out of three, that he gave that evening, and they all arose from events that occurred in the room, while we were talking, was about as neat and piquant a thing, as can be found in our language. Then a light haired fellow—a light headed one, I should say—by heaven, his voice is ringing in my ears yet—the noisiest, most vociferous devil, that ever I met with—told a story—for which he was fined;—this produced a quarrel—some ribaldry—some debating---a reference to the records---the constitution---and a motion to clear the galleries;---that is, as I took it, to throw the visiters out of the window. The hot little fellow was, at length, appeased. Some poetry was offered---pretty good, I thought---then there was a dash at politicks—a knock from the president's hammer—when the theme was changed, with a laugh, to religion—a louder knock—and a general uproar, as if it was grog-time with the builders of Babel—then, some indications of boxing. It was proposed to fight a duel. Done, said one. I accept—choose my weapons.— Very well—what are they? Two fore pounders, he replied, showing his two pounders. Then there was an essay read upon some Babylonish bricks—then a story about Dr. Mitchell; which, I am sure, is true—and it is really too good a thing to be lost. Remember—it is a literary club; and they affect to make such men as Alexander, and Napoleon, and Julius Cæsar, honorary members!—and have actually sent diplomas to some of the throned banditti of Europe. Another of their regulations, that pleased me not a little, was this. When a member rose to speak, the president pulled out his watch, and limited the time, at which he must stop—and to which he must go, under a penalty. The effect was irresistibly ludicrous. One fine fellow, full of fire and heart—with a good deal of the devil in him, I should think—(an eminent advocate here)—was the first victim. His eyes were on the watch[29] [29] A pun quite unintentional, I am sure. He would have been fined among the DELPAIANS.— Ed. ---and his sentences were so pleasantly tagged together--- spun out—repeated, and dove-tailed—till the three minutes were out, that---that—no matter. Then we had some poetry---one stanza of which, I remember. It was deliberately recited, as Pindarick, by the Secretary; a Dutchman, that wears spectacles; talks through his nose; but writes better blackguard, in reality, than Coleman himself. Judge of the effect from a solemn annunciation of such stuff as this! Brief let me be; For brev—i—ty Is the Soul of— W—i—t—. And then there followed a story. Stay---I'd like to have forgotten Dr. Mitchell. There was a boy here, about twelve or fourteen years old, the son of the fat sleepy gentleman, before mentioned; or, of the president, as I was told; who, of his own head, wrote a letter to Dr. Mitchell, last summer, announcing that a society was just established in Baltimore, called the Newtonian Society; and that they had, unanimously, elected him an honorary member; and added, that any communication, from him, would be acceptable to the society, &amp;c. It was signed by some outlandish name, as secretary. The boy forgot the name; and did not know for whom to inquire; until he saw the letter advertised. It was from the credulous old gentleman. I saw it. It was in his own hand-writing; and was, really, a speculation on matters and things, in general—alluvion; organick remains; and secondary formations, etc. etc.; with the Doctor's compliments to the Newtonian Society; and information that he was going, that very night, to a confederacy of a like character, in New-York—to which he should communicate the rapturous intelligence, &amp;c. &amp;c. But the best of the joke was to come. This piece of childish pleasantry, soon took a new shape. It was only known to the boy, (for he was afraid to tell his father;) to the light headed man; and to Dr. Mitchell. The first kept it a secret, for his own sake; the second, out of compassion to Dr. Mitchell. But lo! the Doctor was not so discreet—for it was soon after announced, in the Washington Gazette, that Dr. M. was appointed honorary member of the Newtonian Society of Baltimore! And this very evening, a book is abroad, containing the remarkable events in Dr. M's. life, under his own hand; in which, the hoax, date and all, are distinctly recorded. Upon my word, it is a shame. To this, then succeeded a story, that—though you never smiled before, John, I am sure you will smile at, if you have never heard it. It is about the neatest thing that I remember; and it cost the teller twenty-five cents for telling it—it having been seen in print, by some other member. A Frenchman was travelling, on a close sultry day, with a newly married lady. The curtains were down. She complained of the heat. The curtains were raised. Some passenger spoke to her; and warned her against the sun, that was beating down upon her head. “O, I suppose,” said the Frenchman, “dat de ladi would radder ave a leetel son, as no heir at all!” Did you ever see more effectual punning upon the words air and sun? I ask this question, you know, to avoid the mortification of explaining the joke. It will make you look at it, again. To this succeeded some tolerable punning, for which, to my notion, the whole company deserved to be intolerably—ahem!—I dont say what, but I was provoked to see such men so employed. Then there was a dispute about poetry, and wit;—and a furious altercation followed, in which the president swore positively, that, he'd be damned, if there were a man in all Philadelphia, that knew the difference between the sound of the w and v!—nay, that, when the people heard it there, they could not distinguish the difference. It was said very seriously. Another gave some illustrations, that amused me, from the Spanish, in their confusion of the b and v: d and t; and also in the German. But a tall man, in black, took it up; and, quoting chapter and verse at him, amused me a good deal, with his soberness and phlegm, and closeness. Then there was another squabble, in another quarter, into which I popped my head. Stop John, let me look at my watch—half past ten —yes,—I'll finish with the Delphians. That was about some new poem—a law book—a popular preacher—and the pronunciation of in in the French words inutile, intrigue. The president, off hand, decided that it was sounded alike;—and, I confess, that his arguments were unanswerable. But the practice is settled. I am sorry for it—for it is a mighty pity where one is very positive, to have the fact contradicting him flatly. But then—“so much the worse for the fact,” you know. It was then maintained, that the neatest repartee in our language;—and the truest specimen of wit, on account of its simplicity, and its capability of being rendered into all languages, was this. A gentleman encountered a blackguard fellow. The latter took the wall, saying, as he did so, “I don't permit every d—d scoundrel to take the wall o' me! “But I do!” said the gentleman, and gave it to him. Here was a general hourra Joe! Joe! Joe! They all shouted at once—fine him! fine him! fine him! Another debate followed; more argument; some wit; some pleasantry—and a great deal of noise and nonsense—and then, there was a volunteer essay from the white headed man, in which he took up Mr. Taylor's “unanswerable demonstration,” and proved, from the author's own showing—that Sir Philip Frances could not have been Junius. I was amazed at the effect produced by his arrangement of the same facts. The club—all shook their heads, but whether in contradiction—or drowsiness, I wont say.[30] [30] That essay ought to be preserved; for, when it was written, there was no sort of doubt in the publick mind, about the identity of Junius, and Sir Philip Frances.—Ed. And so passed the evening. We had a good supper, and some rational conversation—but God preserve me, dear John, from the company of professed wits—and anybody, and everybody, indeed, where people meet together to say smart things. Do you remember Harriet?—I saw her last evening. Poor creature! my heart bled for her. I knew that she was here; but there was much difficulty in seeing her.— She was ashamed and afraid to meet me; and, when she came to me, she fell upon my bosom and sobbed, as if her heart would break. Is there any way to save her? Let us think of it. I had a long conversation with her—but I dared not remind her of our childhood. It would have broken her heart. She is very beautiful; more so, than ever, I think; but perhaps her shame, and her streaming eyes---can it be, John, that such a woman—O, heaven and earth!—a woman that might have been my wife ---I wept with her. Yes, John, we must save her. Do you know how she was corrupted? It is a strange tale—her visit was one of piety—mistaken to be sure, but the holiest and purest in nature.— She was one of a religious society, who had been put up to a most perilous charity, no less than that of penetrating into the haunts of profligacy, lewdness and death, and purifying them. Gracious God! that the young and innocent should venture amid the pestilence. Would they hope to reanimate, and cleanse them that are sore all over with disease and rottenness; by putting their own naked hearts to them? Yet that were as rational. Would they reach out a hand, where their own footing was slippery—or less steadfast than the everlasting oak, to preserve, one who was heavier than themselves?—unaided and alone? —Would they take into their innocent companionship, one that carried a mortal contagion in her breath---nay, in the very sound of her voice, and the movement of her eyes and limbs---in the hope of purging it away, and diluting the poison, by their tears, when the atmosphere of heaven, itself---had only quickened it? The effect was natural. She was pursued---watched ---and fell. How could it be otherwise? That woman is in peril, who looks upon a picture that is lewd, even when alone; but her peril is inconceivably heightened, if a man know that she is looking upon it; and if she know that he knows it. But she is lost---for ever and ever, if they look upon it, together. And what picture would so madden and drug the heart, as the living creatures that—no matter---she fell. We walked together. Such an evening! It was just about sunset---and there was a surging lustre about all the horizon, as if all the riches of heaven had been washed up against it. It reminded me of our childhood--- of that evening—but no, I must forget all my past life---all—ah John! John!— By the way: I am somewhat anxious about Sarah.--- Are there any suitors?—She must have some. You may as well answer me; for, who knows but I may be here long enough to get your letter; and it will be such a comfort to me---beside if I go away, it will follow me ---and I may get it in Philadelphia. Do write; will you? And Juliet too---faith John, I can trifle no longer--- how is she?—ha!---a drop of blood falls upon the paper! But so, it has always been, ever since we parted. At first, I had spasms of the heart, whenever I thought of her; but that is past. Now my nostrils only drop with blood—How is she? Does she ever speak of me? Is she happy?—any family?—remember me to her;---I revere that woman, brother---would that—but no matter; I shall soon see her, and be happy. What prevented her from going with Mr. Grenville? Her situation, I suppose. There is another thing. What has become of the old house? Is it yours? And what is that foolish story about its being abandoned, seriously, because it is haunted? By Jupiter! I should like to sleep in it, awhile. They tell some pleasant stories, about ghosts that fight there, after a terrible fashion. I have one, at only the third hand; but, it is said and believed, that, two or three winters ago, when the house had been shut up, for a long time; there was a confounded noise of fire and smoke— and wind and thunder;---and that the flames roared, and the walls shook---and—oh, curse such nonsense. Yet it makes an impression upon the people here. Why is it not inhabited now? I have half a mind to ride out, and blow it up—if it be only to keep the chambers of my boyhood, free from the pollution of Molton's foot. Hang it, brother—there is a feeling here, just here—as if there were people playing chess in my head—that infernal noise last night, that is the cause—so, I won't make any calls, this morning—I'll spend it in writing to you. Did you ever observe how much better you remember anything, that you have heard questioned, than you do, what you ought, naturally, to know? Thus I remember more of my mathematicks, where I have been confoundedly puzzled, and provoked, or flogged—than where I have gone on smoothly—and thus too, that Molton haunts me, with a vividness and distraction, at times, that won't let me sleep. Is he not a fearful compound? I have thought, sometimes, that he must have some heroick qualities:—but your preposterous admiration and enthusiasm; that blind and drunken infatuation of yours, have always prevented me from acknowledging it. There is no shadow, without a correspondent light:—that, of the sun, is of one sort; of the moon, another---and the shadow that the stars, from their littleness, throw out, is hardly perceptible. One substance may throw many shadows, too—if there be bright virtues behind it? May we not hope, from the blackness and colossal stature! and depth of the spectre, that his heart advances—that he must have a great heart; and a great light behind it? I do. I never confessed it before; but I have often thought it. I do believe it. I cannot get that girl out of my head—that evening too—by heaven, the room is full of suffocating fragrance, at this moment, just as the garden was, when we met. I have thought of going, seriously, about a profession. It is really high time, and your indolence and procrastination are an admirable lesson for me. What are you doing?—what shall I do?--- Stop---that won't answer.--- That is not my way. I'll consult nobody. It is like calling a council of war. If you conquer, every one remembers, and tells every word, that he used, to persuade you to the battle; the glory is shared by all.--- But if you are conquered---tush—it is quite another affair, then. They hold their tongues; and the blame is all your own. What think you of death, brother? I have been thinking a good deal of it, lately. It is no such mighty matter, after all. The pain is nothing---I am sure of that: the resuscitation however, is not so pleasant, even in this world---the air rushes into your lungs, like a storm of powdered glass. But---is it not wise, brother, to accustom ourselves, night and day, to the contemplation of mortality? To die---O, it is a trifle. How quiet and sweet, the dead sometimes look! I saw a man fall the other day, on ship-board. A handful of bullets were thrown into his heart. He never moved again. I wished, in my soul, that it had been my case. I am not fit to die, John---I know that, well---but a man that is not fit to die, is not fit to live. And it is a dull life that I am looking to---but not a long one, I hope. I go out, sometimes, in the open air. I did, last evening. I forgot that Harriet was with me. I felt my heart at her worship. I looked up---the footsteps of Jehovah were all along the sky. I wept---I trembled---and, if I had been alone, I should have knelt. There was a blue glimmering all above me, like cold water in the star light---like the shine of blue waves, away off at sea, broken, shivered, and sparkling, in the wind. It began to rain and lighten; and we were driven into a house for shelter. I stood at the window; and it was like a shower of fire abroad, the big drops of rain, in the lightning. I felt a gentle pressure upon the arm. I leaned upon the shoulder of a woman, ere I knew it---heaven! I might as well have leaned upon hot iron, for all the support vol. ii. D d that there was in it. It was not the bosom of innocence ---no---but it was the smoking and blackened, desolate place; where the natural fire of the hearth had been trodden out; and the flame of destruction kindled in its place. I shuddered---Harriet spoke of returning. What was I to do?---I could not talk now of our carriage; no, I was heartily sick of that; and have been, ever since I was at Washington, where all “our carriages” are hacks; and, where, after listening, for half an hour, to a fine woman, all her ostentation, results in this—that she has been paying some visits, and treated herself with a quarter of a dollar's worth of “our carriage,” in her prodigality. I cannot go on—my spirits flag. I am perpetually absent— sighing—thoughtful. These are bad symptoms—and their stages are these—intense thinking—sighing, of course, when you draw your breath—irregular pulsation, and flow of the blood—stagnation—and a broken heart. I am at the stagnation point just now—I have been interrupted, too—God bless the man, for it! What a letter—!—three whole sheets—and such stuff, too. It puts me in mind of our friend,—R's rambling style, there—whose habit of lying and frivolity ran out, at last, in a series of novels—which he called, a reformation. Farewell—I am a good deal disordered; and I know not why. It appears to me that the spirits, with which, I arose this morning, are unnatural, wicked---and, if I were superstitious, I should apprehend some calamity ---at hand. FRANK. P. S.—Don't forget my love to Juliet—or, at least, my affectionate respects—the first thing.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">REV. MR. CARTER, TO MR. JOHN OMAR. Baltimore.— Dear Sir,---A melancholy and distressing duty devolves upon me. A stranger, of a genteel appearance, and youthful, who, I have reason to believe, is a relation; and perhaps, a brother of yours, arrived in this city, a few days ago. His deportment was dignified; but there was a strangeness in his vivacity, which, we were apprehensive, at the first sight, was either artificial; or, in consequence of a temporary alienation of mind. On Saturday evening, last, I met with him at a literary society in this town; and felt an uncommon interest in him, before we separated, on account of a certain nobleness, and manliness in his air; but, before long on another, and a more solemn account. He was unhappy. I perceived that there was some mysterious agony, at his heart. He was absent; for his manner, and his eyes were mute and immoveable, at the very time, while he appeared to be participating, with all his soul, in the boisterous merriment of the evening. I observed, too, that he was agitated frequently, as with an ague—and that the sweat came out upon the back of his hand,---as it rested upon my chair. He affected to enter into the conversation, with great spirit and zest; but, I could perceive, that it was painful to him; and his friend that introduced him, seemed to understand little of his situation; and I have since found that he has no other acquaintance with the unfortunate man, than such as a little business, between them, has given rise to.— I observed, too, that, into whatever position his arms, or hands fell; in that, they remained, until by great, and even painful exertion, like that which a man may use, to remove a limb that is asleep, or dead---they were thrown into a new one. My duties, have led me among the unfortunate of every class; but I have never witnessed a case of more affecting melancholy, than this.— Whether it was one of derangement, or not, I cannot pretend to say; for that is a visitation which may befall the wisest, at times,---and this unhappy gentleman, when deeply engaged, manifested a great collectedness of thought, and a strong, but undisciplined mind. The most alarming symptom, that I saw, was the perpetual flashes of levity, which he threw in, upon whatever subject we entered upon. We spoke of death---he was calm, and grand, for a while---and I felt no common respect for him---he amazed me, by the awful steadiness of his manner—it was somewhat preternatural, in one so young, and, I thought, so given to frivolity. It was rather the manner of one, who has made himself familiar with death; as a philosopher, at least, if not as a christian. We parted; and, the next day, I took the liberty to call on him, with the intention of inviting him to spend the day with my family. I found him somewhat altered, like one that was approaching, every moment, a place of trial.---I was unaccountably affected. It might be imagination in me; but it did appear that the ravages had been carried on, even in the night time;---his lips were cracking and bloody, with fever; his eyes were intensely bright, and full of tears, whenever I permitted him to be thoughtful for a moment. I feared to intrude —and, it was with a feeling of real distress, that I mentioned the object of my visit. Whether he saw my compassion, or not, it would be impossible to say; but, his manner altered, immediately; and there was a cold, and haughty positiveness in it, that froze me. “He was writing,” he said, “and could not, possibly, accept my invitation.”—Yesterday morning, about nine, I was sent for, by the family, and informed, that he had been found, lying upon the floor, and insensible, with an open letter in his hand, about an hour before. How long he had been there, they knew not, with any degree of certainty; but the servant supposed that, about fifteen minutes had passed, since he gave him a large letter from the post office. He was bled; and, after two or three hours, sat up in his bed, and began writing; but, unable to continue it, fainted; and lay in a torpor or trance, until last evening. I had been with him for a moment; but he would communicate nothing to me. He appeared grateful for my attention; but signified, peremptorily, that he must be left alone. Had I thought him so very ill, as he was, I should have watched with him to the last hour. But I left him; and, last night, I was called out of my bed, to visit the family, who were exceedingly terrified. There had been no sound in the room for several hours---and no light. The bell had not rung; and, though expressly forbidden, the servant, apprehensive of some accident, like that of the morning, had, at last, entered the room with candles. The gentleman appeared to be asleep—he was lying on his side, with his hands covering his face. But the truth was soon evident. He was dead. The pillow was bloody, and his hands, too, where they covered his mouth; and, at first, vol. ii. D d 2 we were apprehensive of some violence to himself; but a little examination satisfied us, that it was, probably, a bleeding of the breast, or the rupture of some blood vessel. He had, evidently, died very quietly; for his face was calm—and there was a Bible under his head, with the leaves folded down, showing that he was prepared for what happened to him; or, in a measure, prepared for it. It is much consolation, my dear sir, under these bereavements, to know that death did not come unexpectedly. I entreat you to regard this visit of mine, as no officious interference. He was a stranger; and it was my duty to minister to him. His trunks are in the possession of a gentleman here, to whom I am indebted for his name. The letter alluded to, and found in his room, is signed John; and the servant says, that he put two or three, lately, into the office, directed to Mr. John Omar, New York. I have taken the liberty to address this to the same person; assuring him, that his friend, or relation, whose name I find, by his trunks, and this letter, to be F. Omar, has wanted for nothing; and that the interment will be delayed, for three or four days longer, that any of his friends, at Philadelphia, or New-York, may have an opportunity to be present. Enclosed is a note, without an address, which I took the liberty to read, that I might the better understand where to direct it; together with that which is signed John. Nobody but myself has read either. We know not what has been the cause of this melancholy affair; but, it is conjectured by the family, that a very lovely young woman, who was seen here, sobbing and holding up her hands, two or three nights ago, as she parted with him, is, in some way or other, connected with it. We have made some inquiry; but we cannot hear who, or whence, or what she is. My duties are now at an end. But I have too much reverence for sorrow, to obtrude upon a brother, as I am persuaded that you are, my consolation, at such a moment. I can only say—Go to the Bible—the bruised in heart, and broken in spirit—let them go there—when there is no earthly consolation for them. I am, sir, respectfully, &amp;c. yours, THEOPHILUS CARTER.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">JOHN TO FRANK. O, my poor brother!—God be merciful to thee!—Before this, it may be, that thy heart is already shattered into a thousand pieces. My brother, my brother! how poignant will be thy suffering! So much pains too, as I had taken— so many letters—all to prepare thee for it—and then, to find thee almost at the door—cheerful and festive—gracious God!— Yet, it is possible that you have not received any of my letters; that you do not yet know; not even at this moment, of the desolation that is encompassing you.— May it be so? Prepare yourself—awaken all your faculties—go down upon your knees—imagine the most tremendous blow that could fall upon you—no matter what it is—and then—no, no, my brother; I cannot tell thee what it is, yet. I pity thee. Do not leave Baltimore—do not, I charge thee. I have just received thy little note; and, to-morrow, I shall expect to know exactly the truth. If no letter come to-morrow, I shall set off, myself, for Baltimore. Farewell, my dear, dear brother. Harriot, too!—no, I cannot speak of her, now. JOHN. P. S.—Be prepared for the worst—the worst that can happen to thee, my poor brother. Nothing else can save thee.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">JOHN TO FRANK. I tremble at thy levity, brother. It is unnatural. I am not much used to weeping; but the pleasantry of thy long letter, frightens me. I could bear to see thee sorrowful, stern—though I know well, that thy heart was never made for sorrow or sternness; but this exuberant festivity is frightful. I know not what to write. That letter is before me, with the blood upon her name, yet— hers!—O, would that I knew the truth! Does he know it yet?—Father of mercies! does he know it? O, if not, I would pray thee, to seal up his senses for awhile, until his brother be near to comfort and sustain him! To-morrow, I shall certainly set off; nay, I would, to-day, but I know not how I can—for I have an engagement of the utmost moment, to the happiness of Sarah. Let me tell thee what it is. It will enable my brother to judge of the distraction, under which I labour. Two human beings; two, that are infinitely dear to me, are tugging at my heart, at the same moment, upon opposite sides. Would that I could divide it between them! Sarah is imprudent. I cannot stop, to detail the particulars; but she is infatuated with an adventurer, who has been pursuing her for years, in one shape and another. His name is Randolph. I am to meet him this evening. Every thing depends upon it. I have some suspicion that he is the blackest of villains; and, I very much fear, that Sarah is distractedly fond of him. Molton, I think, knows something of him; and, if it be true, I would not be in Randolph's shoes for the whole world. It is about fortnight, since I saw Molton. He is arrived here, with the intention of going to Liverpool, in the next packet. He means to see Sarah, before he goes, in spite of all her prejudices; which, he says, are unnatural and wicked. Nay, he probably meditates a lesson for her; and I know no man so likely to give it effect. I have made him promise to meet me, this evening, at Sarah's. I want to confront him with Randolph. He does not know that Randolph is to be there; and I shall take care to apprise Sarah, only in season for some little preparation of mind. There is now only one thing, in Molton's character, that troubles me. He is still haunted, night and day, by some childish apprehension. It will destroy him, at last—I am sure it will. I reason with him—but he is so tremendously calm. I ask him if he can believe in apparitions. He only smiles. I repeat the question—and ask if he be afraid of them. His eyes flash fire. No! he says—no!—though all the buried population, of the earth, came crowding around me, at midnight, I would not avoid them, if I could. But do you believe in them? I say again. I do, is always the reply. I believe him;— and I wonder at it. Yet, why should I wonder? Have I, myself, not heard inexplicable sounds; and will not my blood thrill, even now, at the recollection of that room? Why is this? I feel assured, that it was a delusion; yet—no, brother, I cannot go on. To see such a man; at whose touch, systems crumble into dust, and pass away, like smoke in a high wind; before whose arm, and stride, the tenantry of the tombs should fall prostrate; to see him quaking all over with shadows;—a man, before whom go a reasoning army, that lay waste and scatter the best settled doctrines of men;—to see him yielding to the doubtful and dismaying ones; him, at whose touch, flowers will spring up, and blow upon the charnel house—and the awful features of death, take an expression of benignity; from whose tears, as if the colour of his very eyes went with them, and impregnated the earth—the young violets gush up, about the grave and turf—making both of them dear to the heart, and welcome to the thought;—that he should cower and quail before the shadow of death—he, who fears not the substance;—that he should lie down and die, with terrour, before an unreal summoner, who would stand erect, to the blast of a visible Archangel, summoning the world to judgment. O, to see this, to hear it continually; is it not enough to unsettle the understandings of men—and take away their very longing after immortality. Farewell!—farewell! Bear up bravely, my brother, against the trial. The season of trial is the time for the stout-hearted. There is a child left—a child of Juliet. Let that move thee, brother. Be thou a father to it! Farewell! JOHN. P. S.—In two days, I shall be with you. To-morrow I set out—at three o'clock in the morning.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">NOTE—JOHN TO SARAH. I have a favour to ask of you, cousin. I have never asked one, before; and, to-morrow morning, I shall leave the city—perhaps it will be the last that I shall ever ask. You are in peril. Your prejudices, I say nothing about. They were always violent; and, though your temper has grown gentler, and more indulgent, of late; yet, they were never more violent or unworthy of you, than at this moment. Edward Molton is in town. He will sail for England on the fifteenth; and, if we may trust to appearances, I do believe that he will never return. He has been an injured man—a man, more sinned against, than sinning. I would venture to appeal to your generosity, Sarah— for there is not a more generous creature upon this earth; but I would not do it, after making that speech—I would not even be suspected of flattery. Nor would I so wrong my friend, Sarah, as to appeal to your generosity, when all, that we require, is justice. What do you know of Edward Molton, cousin, that is wicked, or mean? What, at least, that is not repented of? And shall he not be forgiven?—he, in whose frame the altercation of his heart and spirit hath been carried on, till he is ready to give up the ghost? Let us be merciful, if we would expect mercy. Recall all that he has done. Discharge your heart of all bitterness toward him; and consent to shake hands with Edward Molton, once, before his departure, as you would, even with your mortal enemy, upon his death-bed. We all have our infirmities, Sarah. You have yours;—at this moment, you are in the most imminent peril. I do not name it. I will not so shock you; but, it is possible that you may yet owe all, that should be dear to a woman, in this life, to Edward Molton. Mark me, Sarah. I know my extravagance. I know my propensity to run from one extreme to another; through good report, and evil report. I am aware, too, how often I have called that man accursed—and then, wept upon his bosom; but all these things are no excuse for you. An hostility so unamiable; so inveterate; nay, so unnatural, as yours, cousin, is impious. How dare you entertain it? I speak plainly, dear Sarah, because I love you; and, because, it is possible that we may not meet again, till all my solicitude may be useless. Frank is still in Baltimore—and I shall go on, to-morrow morning, to meet him; after which, we shall set sail for some country, where both can be happier. Before I go, I would be satisfied of one thing. I have reason to believe that Molton is the only man, who can satisfy me. I believe that he knows something more of Randolph than you do; for his forehead darkens, when I mention his name. Let them meet, if you dare. My first intention was to surprise you, by leading Molton upon you, this evening, unexpectedly; and setting him, face to face, with Randolph:—my next, to give you a moment for preparation. But that were unworthy of all. It is neither a reconciliation, nor an atonement, that is done without deliberation. What say you? He has a right to demand an interview; for you have wronged him. He has a right to demand it, as the constituted guardian of Juliet's babe; for he ought never to leave this country, till he have seen it. He loves the little creature, as if it were born of him; nay, with more than a father's tenderness; and he swears that his last look shall be upon it, when he embarks, that the image may be carried with him, nestling in his heart, wherever he may wander, forever and ever. He has a right, too to take the child away. But all these things are disdained, by him. If he meet thee, it must be of thy own free will. What sayest thou, Sarah? Sarah, I have only one word more to say. It is worth your consideration. If you do not permit me to confront Randolph with Molton, nothing shall ever convince me that it was not because you were afraid. It is hard to say so, dear Sarah; but it is the truth. Yours, dear cousin. JOHN.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">REPLY. Cousin John,— At first, I had a great mind to return your letter; and then, I had almost resolved, when I looked at the conclusion, to send it back, reduced to ashes; with a denial of your request; and a farewell, that you should remember to your dying day. But I put it by, for an hour, till the tears were dry in my eyes—and the blisters upon the paper—and the heat had escaped from my heart. It was very cruel, John—but I forgive you. I have been interrupted—but you have my consent to bring Mr. Molton to me, this evening. I hope that I have wronged him. I sincerely hope it. Convince me that I have, and I will embrace his knees. But, how am I to be convinced? There is no power on earth to do it. Still I shall submit to his presence, hateful as the thought is, rather than—John, my forehead crimsons. What should I be afraid of? What should Randolph be afraid of? I would not have a quarrel here—nay, I will not. I have taken care to provide for that. But, be not too sanguine of the result. Something has happened, which, if you knew it, would make you a little less anxious for the meeting, I apprehend, even on his account, than you are, now. Yes, sir—bring this redoubtable Molton forward. I am ready for the trial—another is as ready as myself. Let us see who quails in it. One word more, cousin. You would have me a hypocrite—a changeling. I cannot be one. My temper is constancy. I am not prone to take impressions, indentures, or curvatures, either toward or against my kind, easily; but, once taken, they are not easily obliterated. “What are his crimes?” Can you ask me? An uninterrupted course of profligacy and blood. No more.— How a man, and still less a woman—a woman, too, like the blessed Juliet—should be so infatuated with the stern, unrelenting character of such a man, is inconceivable to me. But, bring him, cousin;—bring him along—the sooner the better—and we shall then see who skulks away from the trial; when the lists are opened, and the judgment seat unveiled; with the look of greatest horrour and affright. SARAH.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CONCLUSION. The drama is at an end. The curtain has already fallen; and, of them that were the actors, only three are now living. The catastrophe—let me relate it—I was present at a part; and the remainder, I have from an eye witness—a party. Randolph spent the whole afternoon with Sarah, in deep and earnest conversation. As the hour of trial approached, his countenance grew darker and darker: and a deeper intensity of the eye; a steadier, greater self-collectedness grew upon him. Seven was the hour appointed; and it was already half past six. There had been a dead silence for many minutes. Randolph held Sarah's hand, almost as if he knew it not; and supported his forehead with the other. His face was in the shade; but there was a mournful unquiet movement in it, at times. Was it guilt? And then, there was a death-like paleness. Was it the flash of the candle?—or could it be—poor Sarah's heart contracted at the thought—it might be apprehension. The more that she tried to repel the cruel visitor; the more obstinately did it return—her blood felt cold—a little sweat stood upon her lips—she trembled—and yet, there was unspeakable tenderness in her eyes. E E “Randolph,” said she, in a faint voice, “if—if—” He took her hand. “No, love,” said he, “I understand thy thought. I am not afraid to meet this man.” She pressed his hand to her lips—and the tears gushed out, all at once, like a heavy dew, from her eyes;— and she would have fallen upon his neck—but the bell rang. Randolph immediately arose—folded his arms—and stood, fronting the door. It was only a servant from Mr. Omar, saying that he was detained for a few moments; but would be with Miss Ramsay, in less than an hour. Sarah was very thankful for the reprieve. It was as if all the fountains of her heart had been broken up, all at once—they gushed out at her eyes and lips, with all their hidden tenderness!—and she almost fainted upon his bosom in the tumult of her feeling. “Be composed, love;” said Randolph, leading her to the sofa—“be prepared. I do not tremble for myself, but I do for thee. Perhaps—.” He faltered a little; but she put her hand upon his; and it appeared to re-assure him. “Sarah,” said he, at last, “there was a deaf-and-dumb man—a—nay, dear, give me both of thy hands, if thou hast yet, so little command of them—” “Hast thou thought of him lately?” “What is the meaning of this?” “No matter---please to answer me.” “I have, many times---but unwillingly---and I know not why.” “Was he very terrible, to thee, Sarah?” “Very.” “And very hateful?”—said he, in an altered voice. “Gracious God!” cried Sarah, starting from the seat--- “who are you!---what!—” “The deaf-and-dumb man!” was the reply. “Thou!---O heavenly father!”---She was very faint--- but a sweet smile followed;---with a slight expression of terrour in her eyes;---and she parted the rich hair upon his temples---gently, affectionately---and said, almost in a whisper.---“So long, Randolph---so long hast thou pursued me---and I knew it not---well! well!---it was unkind; but I forgive thee. Strange, that I should never have thought of such a possibility.---More than once hath my blood thrilled, at some movement of thy strange eyes---some attitude of thy body---or some sound of thy voice---but I never asked myself the reason---I thought t common, with them that love—but let us talk of that, hereafter.” There was another silence.--She was leaning yet, upon his bosom, with her beautiful arms locked about his neck ---her dishevelled tresses floating backward, from her passionate eyes---and revealing her haughty forehead, invincible yet, but partially subdued, and pale with the giving out of her spirit. “Sarah,” said Randolph, mournfully—“is there nothing that could shake thy confidence in me?” “Nothing!” “Then, why is the man Molton summoned hither?--- How knowest thou but he may bear the proof, that I am an unworthy adventurer---a villain?” “Randolph!” answered Sarah, in amazement. “What ails thee? Thy voice is frightful. Is there any more mystery?” “There is.” “Be a man, then; and lay it all, nakedly, before me.” “Wilt thou believe Molton, if he should say, that I am a scoundrel?” “Not if he say so.” “But if he prove it---what then? You know nothing of me---nothing, but what I have chosen to tell of myself. How know you that I am not all, that?”— “Spencer Randolph---stop. I will not even permit this; ---he cannot prove thee base---my senses will be shut to all proof. I could say”---she smiled---and a tear or two fell upon his hand, as she held it to her heart---“if it were lawful to quote poetry at such moment, that— “I know not—I ask not, If guilt's in thy heart; I but know that I love thee, Whatever thou art.” Randolph locked his hands; and elevated them to heaven. “God be thanked;” he cried---“the hour is now at hand---all my suffering---all my sorrow are wiped away. This from thee, Sarah---is it wise?—is it natural?— is it righteous.” “I know not,” answered Sarah, meekly---“it is something, that I would not have believed once---nay, that I could not---but I feel it now, like a religion.---I cannot doubt thee.---No proof could dishonour thee, or displace thee, dear Randolph.” Randolph had well nigh fallen at her feet---but he upheld himself awhile longer. “What mockery is it, then, to confront me with this Molton! Is it fair, Sarah?---wilt thou believe that he is a villain, though I give thee the proof.” “Will I---!---will I---yes. Randolph, upon thy bare word, unsupported and alone---against his oath---but why does thy countenance change?---why dost thou cover thy face with thy hands?—and what are these sounds, that I hear?” “Gracious God!---such is the judgment of woman!--- O Sarah!” “What do I hear, Randolph? What am I to understand?” “Nothing at present---nothing—a few minutes, and all will be revealed.” His voice grew sad and hollow—he impressed a kiss upon her forehead—“Prepare thyself;” he said, “that may be the last impress of my lips upon thy front, love! —the very last—a few moments more, and thou wilt awake. Stand up, for a moment—look at these papers —is the hand writing familiar to thee?” She looked at them—shrieked—and they fell from her hand—as if they had been a nest of serpents—she fainted —Randolph knelt by her, and supported her. She recovered—“Arise, love,” said he, in a whisper, “arise, I hear footsteps,—they are at hand, and these disordered tresses—these looks of wildness—this—” “O, speak to me!” she cried, kneeling to him—“tell me, O, Randolph, art thou the author of those letters?— Anonymous, too! I am thunderstruck. Didst thou know Molton so well?—That picture, too!—O, it was thyself! Juliet, too! She knew thee. I am bewildered. I know not where I am. Help me up, Randolph. I am very weak. My head swims. Tell me. Hast thou known him so long, too?” “I have.” (The door opened.) “Who art thou, Randolph? In mercy, tell me. Who art thou! and what?” She stood, pale as a statue—her hands locked; and her form bent—her wild eyes established, upon his face, as if the first movement of his lip, was to be life or death to her. Mr. Omar entered—alone.—He paused—he appeared astonished.—“Why, how is this? How long have you been here?” said he. “I have been waiting for you. It is unaccountable. Sarah, where?—Gracious God! What is the matter? Edward Molton, speak.— “What! What!” cried Sarah, gasping for breath.— “Speak! speak! Who is that man? Speak!” “That man!—It is Edward Molton!—” She opened her bright eyes—put forth her emaciated, trembling, thin hands—her lips moved—her blood shook —a black, shadowy convulsion followed—a sob or two —a few tears, a very few, through her shut lids—she gasped for breath—sobbed—smiled—staggered to the feet—embraced the knees—and, while her magnificent black hair fell, in loose and glorious profusion, all about the floor, where he knelt with her;—buried her shame and sorrow, for ever and ever, in the bosom of Edward Molton.

      <field name="fulltext">vol. ii. E e 2 EDITORIAL NOTICE. I intended to add a note to the page, in which the author of Randolph speaks of Mr. Walsh; as deficient in courage, and honesty. It would be capable of misconstruction; and I intended to add, out of respect to all parties, that the author meant, what, indeed, is very apparent from the whole context, political or literary, courage and honesty. In that opinion, I altogether agree with him. But I do trust, that the author would not be wicked or foolish enough, to question, idly, the personal courage of any married man, or the father of a large family: or the moral honesty of any respectable man, where it was not a solemn duty. There is yet another thing, upon which, a remark or two may not be impertinent. I am told, that many of our most respectable newspaper editors have, in one way and another, insinuated pretty boldly, and positively, that they knew the author of Logan, and Seventy-six. They are mistaken—they do not know him. But, no man has gone so far, as that impertinent, meddlesome blockhead, (John E. Hall,) who is the conducter of what, he calls the Port Folio. That man has actually published a criticism upon them; and called them “Neal's Logan and Seventy-six.” Mr. Neal, I find, is mentioned, in Randolph, as a lawyer, resident in Baltimore; the author of Niagara, and some other works, very little known. I have waited for him to reply to Mr. Hall; in the hope that, being upon the ground; resident in the very city, where Mr. Hall once pretended to practise law —and where he (Mr. Hall) is, at this moment, more universally pitied, laughed at, ridiculed, and despised, than any other man that ever lived in it, as I am informed; and, as I believe; he would give Mr. Hall a lesson, for his impertinence and presumption, that would do him good, the longest day that he had to live. Mr. Neal has replied, openly, and like a man; but not as he should have replied. He has disappointed me. He has treated Mr. John E. Hall, with quite too much humanity and good nature. It was no time for pleasantry. He should have executed justice upon him—without mercy. He should have dragged him before the publick, for two or three of his falsehoods—scourged him to the bone—and told him, to his teeth, what I now tell him, in the name of Mr. Neal; after having made the necessary investigation—that, in the remarks of Mr. Hall, concerning him, are two or three very clumsy fabrications—two or three dastardly falsehoods insinuated;—and one direct falsehood more than insinuated. I allude to this. Mr. Hall charges Mr. Neal, with having forgotten to pay for his advertising, when he left Philadelphia. The story is false;—and, I have no doubt, from my knowledge of Mr. Hall, that he knew it to be false, when he wrote it. My respect for Mr. Neal, (to whom I owe this, for the handsome manner in which he has attempted to soothe the exasperated and indignant feeling of a friend; a dear friend of mine, on this very occasion,) and for myself, will not permit me to use any stronger language;—otherwise, I should say, that Mr. John E. Hall lied—and that he knew he lied; but I mean all that could be meant or expressed, by any single word; or, by any combination of words, in the English language; or, in any other, expressive of malicious and intentional falsehood. And further, I am authorized to say, that “Mr. Neal did not “go about reciting his poetry.” He never attempted it, but once; and that was in Philadelphia—among the Athenians—not one of whom would ever give him an opportunity.” “That Mr. Neal did pay everybody in Philadelphia, before he came away; and was particular enough to go in person, three several times; in a heavy rain (without an umbrella!) the whole circuit of the advertising gentry, before they were all settled with; and that, the only person whom he owed, when he left Philadelphia, was Mr. Duane, who would not receive Baltimore money; and he has been paid since. The debt due to him, was one dollar.” And, “that all the knowledge which Mr. John E. Hall has; or can have, on the subject, is drawn from Mr. Neal's foolish preface to the Battle of Niagara, where he relates the whole adventure particularly; and does ample justice to Mr Hall, and half a dozen other blockheads; himself; and to the munificence and publick spirit; and love of literary enterprize; and high-hearted encouragement of genius; and all that —which, then, characterised the Philadelphians. To the other editors, who have presumed to ascribe the above mentioned works, to Mr. Neal, I have nothing to say—either for him; or the author of Randolph; or myself—particularly, as he has declared that he “should be proud of them;” except to caution them, as gentlemen, and as literary men, who know how to understand the sensitiveness of literary men, from repeating, that Mr. Neal, or any other man, is the author of any anonymous work. It is, to say the least of it, always impolitick and unkind; discouraging to professional enterprize; and often very impertinent, indelicate, and mischievous. Let them abuse the work, as much as they will—that, they have a right to do. But let them not charge it, personally, to any man, unless they are prepared to prove it. The truth is, as I have said before, that the author of these works, notwithstanding all that has been said—is not known; and, probably, will not be known, for a long time, if ever, with any degree of certainty. I know more about them, than any body else, now living, upon the face of this earth; and I know that the secret has been properly kept—and that it is too late, now, for the author, himself, to contradict me. There are some people, who may be startled at this; for, if they know me, they know my regard to veracity; and such an assertion will amaze them;—but, let them remember, that a work may be “mine”—and “may have been written by me,” without my being the author. In one word—“no true knight will attempt to peep under my vizor; or steal upon me sleeping; or stunned; when I am not fairly over-thrown; after I have once entered the field with a blank pennon, and a blank shield; and joined battle under them”—so said the author to me, in the last words that he ever wrote—the conclusion of which I subjoin—adding that—I will redeem his gage. “Let the following notice,” he says, “appear on the last page of the book, if it should ever be published.” “The author of Randolph will not be drawn from his concealment. No matter for his reasons—they are good. But he will not hide himself from any sort of accountability.” Any communication, therefore, post paid, (that he may not be troubled with boys,) directed to George S. Sampson, R. M. Philadelphia, will meet with prompt and suitable attention, from himself, if living, and in this country, at the time; and, if not, from a friend, who will take his place. Neither of them is capable of stabbing in the dark; or sneaking away from any retribution, under any pretence.” Since the above was written, I have received a line, from a personal friend of Mr. Neal. He informs me, that Mr. Neal had written a polite note to Mr. Hall—which Mr. Hall had received; but, had not answered; that, his reply to Mr. Hall, pleasant and temperate as it was, is of such a nature, that few editors can be expected to publish it; and that, all things considered, he is anxious to secure it a more permanent existance; and a more extensive reading, than it would obtain, by being confined to the newspapers; and, that—to say all in one word—he would thank me to give it a place, in a loose folio, at the end of Randolph. I shall do it; but not in the way requested. I shall make it a part of the work, itself. I am glad of an opportunity to oblige my friend, and Mr. Neal;—to punish Mr. Hall, in a way, that he will never forget, for his folly and impertinence—to assuage the exasperated feeling of another man, whom I love and venerate;—to do justice to all parties; and particularly, to speak of the bold, but very extravagant editor of the Columbian Observer, (Philadelphia) in which paper, Mr. Neal's reply first appeared; an editor, who, if he would temper his boldness and fire, with a little more benignity and discretion, would be one of the few men in this country, to whom the children of literature might look, for countenance and support, in any emergency. From the Columbian Observer, (Philadelphia, Aug. 13, 1823.) MR. JOHN E. HALL, AND THE PORT FOLIO. Sir—I send the following to you, rather than to any Editor in our city, for several reasons; first, because the Editor of the Port Folio in overhaling me, has thought fit to attack two or three other people; and yourself, probably on MY account; and, secondly, because, as I have no personal acquaintance with you, you may not be influenced in your judgment about publishing it; and thirdly, that he may be met on his own ground; not so much, because he is worth trouncing any where, or because I do not perfectly understand his motive, in trying to blackguard himself into notice—as that two or three innocent people, who have been abused by him, on my account, may not be left underfended. “A damned good natured friend” of mine; such as abound every where, on such occasions, put the last number of the Port Folio, into my hands about an hour ago, advising me not to read something in it, about myself. It is not once a year, that I see the Port Folio—nor once in five years, that I read a page in it; but such an invitation, so given, was irresistible. When I had finished, he advised me to reply—me—to Mr. Hall— (John E. Hall, I believe his name is.) What had I to do with him, pray? I have no objection to his abusing my poetry, or myself—at this distance. It might be another matter, if we were both dwelling in the same city. No—I have nothing to do with it, or him. The author of Logan and Seventy-six, may take him in hand if he will; and yet, if I were he, I should be a little wary, I think; for, as I live, I think that Mr. Hall has given a very favourable extract from the latter work. To my notion, if his criticism be unjust, it is the very thing for the author; and if just, what has he to complain of? Saying this, I left my friend, with no intention of replying in any way, to Mr. Hall. But, after a little reflection, I have changed my purpose— for the sake of others—not for myself. I am sorry that he has ventured upon the repose of Niagara— I had hoped that the ghost of that work, which, if his judgment be true, has been “buried and forgotten,” for a long time, was laid for ever. But I am more than sorry, at the unprovoked allusions to other people, that I find in his criticism on it; and, as I have it in my power to explain the cause thereof, perfectly to my own satisfaction, I will do it. It may save Mr. James G. Percival; and you, Mr. Editor; and the author of Logan and Seventy-six, some angry feeling. Some years ago, when I was a boy, I wrote an article for Mr. Hall's Port Folio, out of a desire to benefit a friend, which, Mr. Hall, while he affected to be carried away in his admiration for it, so cruelly misunderstood, and misrepresented, by his blundering, that I could never think, either of him, or, of his Port Folio afterward, with common patience. Mr. Hall made an immediate attempt to engage me for a regular contributor to his work. But, at that time, I was under engagements with the Portico, here; a rival journal, which would have prevented me, even if my respect for myself would not, from acceding to Mr. Hall's proposition. That was the first offence. Mr. Hall was rather sore, and suspicious, for a long time afterward; and the next thing that happened to disturb his fine temper, was a novel—a most unlucky one, I confess—called Keep Cool, of which a friend of mine, for whom he had, or affected to have, the greatest admiration, wrote a review; after getting a promise from him (I believe) to insert it. But, about that time, Mr. Hall had thought of a very ingenious expedient to replenish his subscription list; he had given notice to authors, that, if they expected notices of their works to appear in his Journal, they must enclose the price of one year's subscription—six dollars. I did not send him the six dollars, and he did not publish the review. I then published a second edition of Niagara—in which I did Mr. Hall the honour to mention him, among half a dozen other block heads; and gave him some friendly advice; advice, which the present reputation of the Port Folio and its editor, proves to have been honest and judicious. I did not actually advise him, in so many words, to go and hang himself, it is true; but I did advise him to abandon literature—which would, probably, have resulted in the same thing. I laughed at him—pitied him—and let him off, at last, in downright compassion; but, with a compliment to him as a lawyer; and to his Law Journal, as a law work —for which I am now heartily ashamed and sorry; and which nothing but my inexperience and presumption at that time, would be any apology for. That was the third offence. As for Logan and Seventy-six, I have nothing to do with them, now. If they deserve half the abuse that they have received, it would be very foolish to abuse them at all. My name could be of no advantage to the author:—and, while I confess, that, with all their faults and follies, I should be proud of them; I cannot but reprobate the impertinence and rashness of those, who dare to ascribe them to me, on no better ground than conjecture. There are some things, that I could say to Mr. Hall, and of him, if I would permit myself to forget the dignity of a gentleman, which would fully reconcile the persons, who are associated with me, in his remarks —to any thing but his approbation. But, as it is, while I tell them that the true reason of their being abused, is, because one of them has praised a work, supposed to have been written by me!—because another's real name is like one of my assumed ones! and, because Mr. Hall suspected me to have written, or aided in the writing of Logan and Seventy-six!—While I do this, I cannot part from Mr. Hall again, without repeating the substance of my advice—which, I assure him, is kindly meant; and he will find it so. It is, that he should let polite literature alone; and, particularly, all the higher branches of it; abandon the Port Folio (in retaliation upon the subscribers); forget his old antagonist of the Portico, and the Telegraph; leave off puffing himself and the Port Folio, in the Baltimore newspapers; and mend his manners. In which case, if he give up the Law Journal; leave off writing, and talking; destroy all that he has ever written; and stick to the business of translation and compilation, in the humbler departments of law—(such as Hall's Emerigon and Hall's Justice; books that are not worth the binding) he and his doings may be forgotten. And what more could his best friend—his own father—wish for? JOHN NEAL. Baltimore, Aug. 8, 1823. P. S. On account of Mr. Jas. G. Percival, the poet, who may not know the reputation of Mr. Hall; permit me to repeat, that he is abused solely on account of a mistake in the name. I once assumed the name of George E. Percival, for a particular occasion;—and it is that mistake, which has led Mr. Hall to assail that amiable man, and beautiful poet, in a manner that---what can I say, more bitter?—has disgraced HIMSELF. J. N. N. B.—I have just heard of another pleasant specimen of Mr. Hall's piddling, mischievous, gossipping, and wicked temper. Mr. Neal, it appears, was, many years ago, a merchant, in extensive business, at Baltimore; failed; and was indebted, at the time of his failure, to the house of George Grundy &amp; Sons;—the head of which house spent a good deal of time, and no little money, trying, in vain, to prevent the discharge of Mr. Neal, under the insolvent laws of Maryland; and to convict him, in any way, of any impropriety whatever—having the books and papers of the whole concern, in his possession. Mr. John E. Hall, it appears, had heard of this; and, taking it for granted, that an unpaid creditor, must be a mortal enemy; and able, if anybody could, to blacken the character of his debtor—actually wrote to the house of George Grundy &amp; Sons, to whom he was a perfect stranger, a few days ago, to learn the character of Mr. Neal! The letter was without date or place; and, instead of being able to give Mr. Hall any satisfaction, such as he wanted—these gentlemen had some difficulty in finding out who Mr. Hall was! What a mischievous wretch! How deadly and fatal might such a fellow be, if his courage and talent bore any proportion to his malignity and spite. Upon my soul, I am inclined to believe, that the creature is some peevish, disappointed old maid, who has contrived to slip into a hat and breeches, that did'nt belong her. A pretty fellow, indeed, for the successor of the polite, noble-hearted Dennie, in the management of the Port Folio! John E. Hall is a man that never writes English, except by accident—never by design. Had I leisure, I should like to furnish a few examples of his own writing; a few of his blunders in translation; two or three of his editoria! improvements; a book of which might be made up; to prove, not only that he cannot write English, himself—but that he will not let any body else write it, if he can help it. Still, one or two specimens may not be amiss. “An example is familiar to every man. Who has not stooped from a height, and clung to earth for support and strength?” said one of his correspondents. John E. Hall, being “delighted” with the sentence, made this of it:—“An example is familiar to every man who has not stooped from an height, and clung to earth for support and strength!” Again—but this example is purely his own. “There is a humorous Jew who sometimes spits upon his gabArdine and calls him by ludicrous nicknames, which seem to smart like a Burgundy plaIster, seasoned with Spanish flies.” That is—the nicknames (not the man) smart!— like a Burgundy plaister!—(for plaster)—and two commas are omitted in the punctuation. Here, too, the writer knew that he was in a glass-house; and, of course, was doubly fortified;—yet, in two lines and a half, there is one blunder in the sense; one, in a verb; another, in grammar; two, in punctuation; and two, in orthography!—Ed.</field>
